ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1960 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year i960 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The estimated population for the year was 46,140. Vital Statistics: The number of births was 607, 41 more than in 1959' The birth rate per 1,000 was 13.1 (12.2 in 1959). The number of deaths was 352 (414 in 1959). The death rate was 7»6 per 1,000 (8.9 in 1959)• To allow for differing sex and age distribution of local populations, comparability factors are supplied by the General Register Office. These factors enable adjustments to be made in birth and death rates so that comparisons can be made with other areas and with England and Wales as a whole. Tho infant mortality rato was 16.4, the rate for England and Wales being 22. The table on page 4 shows at a glance the birth and death rates for tho years 1955-1960. Causes of Death: The principal causes of death were diseases of the heart and arteries, and cancer, which conditions accounted for 189 and 86 deaths respectively, out of a total of 352 deaths. Infectious Diseases: The most prevalent of the infectious diseases were scarlet fever, whooping cough and dysentery. There were no notifications in respect of poliomyelitis. The figure of 14 for new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis is the lowest recorded since 1932. Chiropody Service: The chiropody service sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee was fully maintained. 2. Atmospheric Pollution: The borough commenced participation in the Essex County Council scheme for the measurement of atmospheric pollution during the year. New Legislation in I960: New legislation in 1960 included the following Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960 Public Health (infectious Diseases) Amendment Regulations I960 Noise Abatement Act I960 Dr. F.G. Brown, Area Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the statistical matter on pages 5 and 6. In conclusion, I would like to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Department for their co-operation during the year. J. H. CROSBY Medical Officer of Health Health Department, Town Hall, Chingford, E.4. Tel: Silverthorn 3601 August, 1961. SECTION A 3.

(h) Hospitals The hospitals providing general medical services for Chingford residents are chiefly the Connaught Hospital, Walthamstow, the Wanstead Hospital, Wanstead, the North Middlesex Hospital, Edmonton, and the Whipps Cross Hospital at Leytonstone. Persons with infectious disease needing admission to hospital are accommodated at Isolation Hospitals in nearby districts, viz: St. Ann's Hospital, Tottenham, South Lodge Hospital, Winchmore Hill; or, if no bed is available at these hospitals, the Emergency Bed Service arranges admission to the nearest hospital where a bed is available. ( The infectious disease unit at the Honey Lane Hospital, Wultham Abbey, was closed by the Regional Hospital Board as from 25th July, 1961, to provide accommodation for oral surgery. ) (i) Day Nurseries There is one Day Nursery in the district, situated at 136/138, Chingford Mount Road. Regular medical inspection of the children attending this Nursery was carried out during the year. (j) Home and Domestic Help Scheme There is a Home and Domestic Help Scheme in the Chingford district, under the auspices of the Essex County Council. Application for these facilities should be made to the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. (k) Chiropody Facilities Chiropody sessions are now held at both Essex County Health Services Clinics in the area and a limited domiciliary service is provided, Priority is, in the first instance, given to the elderly, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. Appointments for such treatment must be made through the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. There were 83 new applicants in 1960 for treatment under the scheme for providing chiropody for Chingford residents of pensionable age, sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee and administered by the Health Department. Since the scheme began in 1956, 639 persons have applied for treatment and 81 have been transferred to the County Chiropody Scheme, for either home or clinic treatment. Five persons hold licences from the Essex County Council to carry on private practice as chiropodists in the borough. Their premises are inspected annually. There is one establishment licensed for beauty treatment; this also is inspected annually. 8.

SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Personal Note This is the thirty-first and final contribution I shall have to make to these Reports and it is not unnatural that any anticipated pleasure of retirement should be tinged with an element of regret at leaving the Borough of my adoption. In my Report for the year 1954 I did comment on general public health aspects of the quarter of a century I had then served this authority and since that time perhaps the most outstanding development has been the recommendations of the Royal Ccmission on Local Government,, It is strange that this matter was very much to the fore when I commenced my career in this Borough in 3.930 and to me, it would be stranger still, if Chingford should ever lose its identity. I shall leave for ray successor the programme which has been approved in principle by the Council for the establishment of Smokeless Zones throughout the Borough. This programme will, if completed in accordance with the schedule, give a considerable amount of additional work to the department over the next fifteen years. It will, in addition, call for the expenditure of a considerable amount of public money but in terras of environmental hygiene will be worthwhile. I would mention again that the Refuse Disposal Works have now reached the stage when soon urgent attention must be given either to reconstruction or to the provision of a Loading Bay to enable refuse to be transported outside the town for disposal. Much thought has been given to this problem by the Public Health Committee and the Council over the past eight years and although I have submitted many schemes not one has yet come to fruition. To Members of the Council, to the staff of the Public Health Department and my colleagues in other Departments, I would wish every success in their labours for the benefit of the residents of this Borough. JAMES F. ROGERS Chief Public Health Inspector. 20th September. 1961. 11. SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF IKE AREA Water Supplies, A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board; the supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity. It was not considered necessary to take any samples of water for bacteriological examination and the supply is not liable to plumt o-solvent action. No action was necessary in respect of contamination and the whole of the dwelling houses in the borough are supplied from public water mains. Some considerable improvement was reported in the amount of contamination in water supplies due to radio-active fallout. Although some contamination arising out of the French nuclear tests was detected in the rainfall, this was not apparent in the water supplied by the Board, Rivers and Streams, Thirty-six visits were made during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses. Informal action secured the abatement of minor instances of pollution. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal, The Borough Engineer reports as follows:- "Sewerage - with the exception of one or two areas where surcharge occurs in exceptionally wet weather the sewerage of the district is satisfactory. Sewage Disposal — the present works are expected to become redundant in 1963 when all sewage will be treated at the Edmonton Works of the Middlesex County Council, In the meantime during periods of drought or of heavy rain the present works which are of only about half the required capacity are unable to produce a first class effluent, despite the fact that 30% of the dry weather flow is now being pumped to the Edmonton Works, 12. It is essential because of the deteriorating condition of the Works that nothing should be allowed to delay the transfer of sewage to the Edmonton Works by 1963." Fly Nuisance. No complaints were received during the year as to the emergence of flies from the waters of the Metropolitan Water Board Reservoirs and it was evident, therefore, that the new treatment put into operation in 1957 could be regarded as most successful. This treatment consisted of spraying with a chemical insecticide termed Dieldrin in the place of spraying with a watery suspension of D.D.T. powder. Public Cleansing (a) Refuse Collection As in previous years it is pleasing to report that a weekly collection of refuse and salvage was maintained. Whilst this service was carried out with clockwork regularity week after week it could only be done at the expense of the street cleansing service, as street orderlies were used to supplement the men employed for the purpose of refuse collection when these latter were away siclc or on holiday. During the year under review many men/days were lost to the street cleansing service by this means, but refuse collection, quite properly, was regarded as the paramount public health service. The total weight of refuse delivered to the Works was 11,705 tons as compared with 11,989 tons in the previous year. The Registrar General's estimate of population at the mid-year 1960 was 46,140. The number of premises from which refuse was collected showed an increase, being 14,746 as against 14,651 for the previous year. The net cost per ton for the collection of refuse was 36/ld, as against 33/3d. for the year ended March, 1960 and 34/6d, for the year ended March, 1959. There was, therefore, an increase in the unit cost per ton. Five collection vehicles were in daily use for house refuse collection with one other vehicle used for the most part for the collection of butchers and greengrocers and other trade refuse. One vehicle was replaced during the year, this being a Karrier Dual Tip machine. In accordance with the policy of the Council tnis was powered by a diesel engine giving a total of four refuse collection vehicles so fuelled. 13. (b) Salvage A record income of £14,570 was achieved for the year and whilst approximately half of this amount was in respect of the sale of waste paper, there was also a major contribution from the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The result of this achievement not only had the effect of reducing the net cost per ton for the disposal of refuse to the modest sum of 3/4d, but also returned to industry many tons of materials which otherwise would have been completely wasted. In local government circles, some argument still persists as to the real value of salvage activities but the criterion by which any scheme can be judged is the net cost per ton; if this compares favourably with the national averages, then any scheme can be regarded as economically sound. Nationally, this country is not yet so well placed that it can jetison thousands of tons of potential raw material, (c) Refuse Disposal The net cost per ton for the disposal of refuse was 3/4d, as compared with 5/3d, in the previous year and 5/l0d. for the year ended March, 1959, During the year the Public Health Committee gave considerable attention to the question of an alternate method of refuse disposal. The scheme ultimately approved for submission to the Ministry of Health indicated the provision of a Loading Bay for the transference of all refuse, after sorting, to a tipping site outside the town. At the time of writing this report the decision of the Ministry on the matter of loan sanction had not been received, but as the phasing of the work was such that effective completion necessitated the works being commenced in April, it is clear that the scheme cannot proceed during the financial year 1961/62, The existing works were maintained with a reasonable degree of efficiency, but, nevertheless, it was inevitable that on occasions some difficulties were experienced with the emission of charred paper from the chimney stack at the Works and greater difficulties can be anticipated in future years, (d) Collection and Disposal Costs The net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charges, was £23,089 or 39/5d, per ton as against £23,079 or 38/6d. per ton for the previous year. 14. (e) Street Cleansing This service attracted the attention of the Committee on many occasions during the year due to the fact that it was only on rare occasions that the full complement of 12 men was available for street cleansing duties. The problem is, or appears to be, almost incapable of solution; very few men today will undertake this task which appears to have a stigma attached to it and is poorly paid in relation to the arduous nature of the duties. Mechanical sweeping cannot deal with footpaths and cannot, in a district like Chingford, with many miles of grass verges and shrubberies, adequately deal with the weeding of channels and footpaths. The street cleansing service has endeavoured to do many jobs which normally would not come within the category of 'street cleansing*, such as the constant weeding of channels due for the large part to the seeding of grass verges, the trimming of the base of trees, the collection of grass cuttings after the mowing machines have done their work, the picking up in winter time of tons of grit put down to prevent skidding of motor vehicles and finally the picking up of loose chippings after roads have been resurfaced. In spite of shortage of labour and of subsidising other departments it can be said that the streets of the Borough were kept in a reasonable condition throughout the year. The costly business of the picking up of litter thrown down by thoughtless residents continues; the cost throughout the country must be enormous and in Chingford amounts to over £12,000 per annum, or approx. 4d rate. Surely the time has come for more active use to be made of the byelaw in force as to the Deposit of Litter to the Detriment of Public Amenities. A gang system of street sweeping was still used with three 24-cell Morrison Electric Trucks which continue to function satisfactorily. They have now been in continuous use for eight years and have fully justified their provision for the economic and efficient carrying out of this service.

At one convenience, in an attempt to reduce wilful damage to a minimum, attendants were on duty each week day from 6,30 p.m. until 10,30 p,m, and all day on Saturdays and Sundays, 16, COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE COST STATEMENT 1960/61 Item Particulars Collection Disposal Totals Percentage of total gross expenditure 1 2 3 4 5 £ £ £ % REVENUE ACCOUNT 1 GROSS EXPENDITURE: (i) Labour 11837 9816 21653 57 (ii^ Transport 9293 - 9293 25 (iii) Plant, equipment, land and buildings 21 3028 3049 8 (iv) Other items 499 3165 3664 10 (v) Total gross expenditure 21650 16009 37659 100 2 GROSS INCOME 535 34035 14570 – 3 NET COST 21115 1974 23089 – 4 Capital expenditure met from revenue (included above) - – – – UNIT COSTS s. d. s. d. s. d. 5 Gross cost per ton, labour only 20, 3. 16. 9. 37. 0. 6 Gross cost per ton, transport only- 15. 11. – 15. 11. 7 Net cost (all expenditure) per ton 36. 1. 3. 4. 39. 5. £ £ £ 8 Net cost per 1,000 population 458 43 501 9 Net cost per 1,000 premises 143 14 157 17.

Public Swimming Bath There is one large open air public swimming bath in the district and the source of the water used for filling is from public supplies (Metropolitan Water Board), The method of treatment of the water is continuous chlorination and filtration and the water has a six-hour turn-over of 130,000 gallons per hour. Summaries of the total chlorine and alkalinity readings are forwarded weekly to the Health Department by the Borough Engineer, The pool was opened on the 7th May and closed on the 11th September, I960, The total attendance throughout the season was 155,387 "the highest attendance being on the 19th June when 11,251 persons were present. Samples of water were taken from the Pool on five occasions and the results in all cases indicated that the water wad of a high standard of bacterial purity. 29. Paddling Pool One sample of water was taken from the paddling pool at Chingford Hall Park because of the presence of a yellow deposit. The water, however, was considered by the bacteriologists as suitable for the purposes intended. Wasp Nests During the year the Rodent Operative also dealt with 64 wasp nests. This service, for which charges are made, is much appreciated by residents and involves the Operative in a considerable amount of time worked after normal hours. Schools The general condition and supply of water to schools has been satisfactory during the year. Co-operation continued with the School Medical Officer and reports were forwarded to that Officer following quarterly visits paid to the canteens attached to all Schools, During the year continued progress was made in the execution of works of repair and maintenance. Offensive Trades Within the meaning of the Public Health Act there are no offensive trade premises in the district but there are eight fish fryers. The number of visits made to fish shops was 152, Bakehouses. Fourty-six visits were paid to the five bakehouses in the district and generally they were maintained in a satisfactory condition. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A full time Rodent Operative is employed for rodent infestation work and whilst there was no evidence of major infestations in the town, 1228 visits were paid to deal with minor infestations at private and business premises and in connection with sewer maintenance. The twenty-third and twenty-fourth maintenance treatments were carried out in April and October respectively. In April 119 manholes were baited and of these 21 showed couplete or partial takes; 178 manholes were baited in October, 34 of which showed complete or partial takes. 30. Clean Air Act. 1956 (a) Smoke Control Areas In 1959 the Council submitted to the Ministry of Housing & Local Government, a phased programme for the introduction of Smoke Control Areas throughout the Borough, This was in accordance with Circular 5/59, the Ministry having confirmed that Chingford was within one of the "black areas", such areas being defined as of dense population and where frequency of fog was thirty occasions per year or over. The programme indicated that the Borough would be divided into nine Smoke Control Areas, such areas to be introduced over a period of fifteen years. The Council resolved that for the purpose of making grants towards the cost of adaptations in Smoke Control Areas, the maximum sum for the replacement or adaptation of existing open inset fires, irrespective of the type of appliance chosen by the householder, be similar to that in respect of Council owned properties but that the cost of fixing be considered on its merits. The cost of such appliances to Council owned properties in Phase 1 was £4. 7. 2d, and this sum was, therefore, judged reasonable in relation to appliances provided to privately owned houses, whether open inset, gas or electric fires. Phase 1 of the programme termed "the Chingford Smoke Control Order 1960 (No. l)" was provisionally approved by the Ministry in January, I960, was duly confirmed and came into operation on the 3rd November of that year. This pilot scheme related to 387 properties, the majority of which were Council owned. At the time of writing this report, the final costs of the scheme have not been published, but generally the work necessary for the adaptation of appliances was completed without undue difficulty. Of the 387 properties 320 were in Council ownership and of the remaining 67 properties applications were received from only 22 owners, or 32,8% for grants towards costs of adaptations. The map on page 32 indicates the manner in which the Borough has been divided for the purpose of Smoke Control Orders and a brief description of these Areas is as follows:- Phase 1. 1960; The Chingford Smoke Control Order, No. 1, and the area covered by this Order is that part of the Borough north of Yardley Lane, having an area of about 38 acres and including 387 properties. All are private dwellings with the exception of the Lea Valley Social Club. Of the 387 properties, 322 are owned by the Council and 65 are privately owned. Of these 30 were built by the Council for tenant-purchase (Sewardstone Gardens) and 6 formerly owned by the Council have now been purchased by the tenants. 31. Phase 8a. 1962: An area bounded on the north side by Priory Avenue and on the south side by Hampton Road, and on the east side by old Church Road and Chingford Mount Road. The area comprises 1,700 dwellings. Phase 8b. 1963: This area is bounded on the north side by Hampton Road and on the south side by the Borough boundary. The number of houses is approximately 1,500 together with several factories, Phase 2. 1964: Incorporating approximately 2,000 houses; includes the whole of the L.C.C. estate plus certain privately owned properties on the south side of Whitehall Road and to the south of Hatch Lane, Phase 3, 1966: Comprising approximately 1,430 houses, consists of part of the northern section of the district with boundaries on the north side of Kings Head Kill and the north side of Station Road. Phase 4. 1968: Comprising approximately 1,162 houses in part of the northern section of the district., with boundaries on the south side of Station Road and the north side of Kings Road and Whitehall Road, This area contains Chingford Station, Phase 5. 1970: Comprising approximately 1,695 houses on the western boundary of the Borough and bounded by the south side of Kings Head Hill, north side of the Ridgeway, the west side of Old Church Road as far as Priory Avenue (North side). Phase 6, 1972: Includes the central portion of the district bounded on the east side by the railway line, on the west side by Old Church Road and the Ridgeway and the north side of New Road, This area would comprise approximately 2,532 houses and also the Refuse Disposal Works, Phase 7. 1974: This includes part of the southern area of the Borough comprising approximately 1,911 houses. It is bounded by the south side of New Road and the east side of Chingford Mount Road, A street/year index far Smoke Control Orders is included at the conclusion of this Report. 32. 33. (b) Notice of Proposals (Section 3 (3)) Two notifications were received as to the installation of oil-fired furnaces each with maximum heating capacity of fifty-five thousand or more British thermal units per hour, (c) Prior Approval (Section 3 (2)) In two instances, plans and specifications were submitted in connection with the installation of oil-fired furnaces, in one instance to a school and in the other, a factory. In each case, local authority approval was granted subject to the necessary works being carried out in accordance with B.S.S. 799/53 as amended, and to the height of the chimney stacks being increased. 34.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply. The milk supply is from several large firms with dairy premises outside the Borough boundaries and mainly pasteurised. Thirteen samples of milk were analysed during the year and all were certified to be genuine. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1949. Graded Miles - The following table shows the licences granted during the year for the sale of milk under the special designations as provided by the above Regulations 9 dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised, 15 dealers' licences to sell milk as Sterilised, 3 supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised, 4 supplementary licences to sell milk as Sterilised, 7 dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested, 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested, 1 supplementary licence to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested, (Pasteurised) Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Food and Drugs Authority The Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and during the year samples approximating in number to two per thousand of the population were taken and submitted to the joint Public Analysts, Public Analysts Dr. J.H. Hamence, F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.3. and Mr. P.S. Hall, F.R.I.C., 20, Eastcheap, London, E.C.3., are the Joint Public Analysts for the area. Samples submitted for Analysis 111 samples of food and drugs were submitted for analysis, 6l formal and 50 informal and it will be seen by the following table that a reasonably wide field was covered. The table shows that six samples were reported upon adversely. 38, The Public Analysts commented adversely on one sample of "creamed rice milk pudding" because a substantial proportion of the milk in the pudding was in the form of skimmed milk powder. In the opinion of the Analysts milk pudding should be prepared essentially from full cream milk, cereal and sugar particularly in those cases where the description included the word "creamed". The matter was taken up with the manufacturers concerned and the label subsequently altered. One sample of liqueur flavoured chocolates was found on examination to be affected with mould growth and many of the chocolates were devoid of contents. The chocolates were of foreign manufacture and as stocks were exhausted at the retailers premises no further action was taken. One sample of chocolate flavoured milk drink was forwarded to the Public Analysts because of the presence of foreign matter and microscopic examination showed that this consisted of a mass of mould mycelium. Legal proceedings were instituted. One sample of goat cheese was found to be unsatisfactory in that the declaration on the label stated that it contained at least 35% of fat calculated on a dry basis. Analysis proved, however, that the cheese contained only 33.93% of fat. The attention of the manufacturers was drawn to the deficiency and the label amended. Two samples of acetic acid solution were found to be unsatisfactory in that the strength declared on the label was 19/20% w/v whereas examination showed that the content of acetic acid in one sample was 15,4% and in the other 15.5% w/v respectively. The matter was reported to the manufacturers following which all stocks were withdrawn. During the year action was taken with regard to the retailing of sweets in mis-labelled cartons. The cartons used were identical in size to those used for the packaging of dyes and when the makers of the dyes were approached they stated that permission had not been given for their cartons to be used for the purpose of packaging sweets. It was felt that some good purpose had been served in taking up this matter. 39.

The number of inspections of registered food premises during the year:- 305 4. Condemned food is disposed of by incineration at the Refuse Disposal Works. The Slaughterhouses Act. 1958 - Section 3 As required by The Slaughterhouse Reports (Appointed Day) Order, 1959 and The Slaughterhouses (Reports) Direction 1959, the Local Authority submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a Report on the existing and probable future requirements for slaughterhouse facilities. Up to the 31st December, 1959, there was within the Borough only one small private Slaughterhouse with a very limited through-put. This was subject to annual licence and the owner elected not to apply for renewal. The through-put was in any case not sufficient to materially influence the meat supplied to the district as a whole. Consultation with interested parties indicated that supplies of home killed meat were, in general, obtained from the Central Markets, Smithfield augmented in a few instances from other wholesale Depots, Without exception, satisfaction was expressed as to the quality and quantity of meat supplied from the Central Markets, From the extensive enquiries made, therefore, the conclusion was reached that so long as the aforementioned Markets were retained (or some other Market of a like nature) the needs of the district in respect to meat supplied could be adequately met without the provision of local public or private Slaughterhouses. 43. Inspection of Meat and Other Foods (a) Examination and Seizure Certain portions of diseased and unsound ox liver were found exposed for sale, were seized and removed from the retail butchers premises to be dealt with by a Justice of the Peace, who condemned the food and ordered it to be destroyed (See "Legal proceedings"). (b) Examination and Voluntary Surrender of Food The following articles of unsound food were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed:- TINNED & BOTTLED Article Quantity Article Quantity Apricots 36 Milk 41 Beans 37 Oranges 18 Beetroot 1 Ox Tongue 2 Brisling 1 Paste (crab) 2 Cream 9 Peaches 81 Creamed Rice 5 Pears 26 Corned Beef 14 Peas 26 Cherries 10 Pease Pudding 1 Chicken 2 Pilchards 16 Carrots 8 Pineapple 60 Crab 3 Plums 1 Casserole 1 Prunes 3 Damsons 2 Ravioli 12 Fruit Salad 36 Rhubarb 1 Frankfurters 2 Rice 3 Grapes 5 Salmon 31 Crapefruit 6 Sardines 3 Herrings 1 Soup 32 Ham 12 Spaghetti 5 Irish Stew 1 Steak Pie 12 Jam 10 Stewed Steak 14 Kippers 3 Strawberries 3 Lambs Liver 4 Tomatoes 63 Luncheon Meat 25 Tomato Juice 1 Lemon Juice 5 Veal 3 Loganberries 18 OTHER FOODS Fish 4 stone Milk Powder 20 lbs.

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The Counties Public Health Laboratories, Thresh House, Gray's Inn Rd., London, W.C.I., undertake bacteriological examinations for, the Council through the Essex County Council Bacteriological Laboratory Service. During the year thirty samples of ice cream, as set out below, 6 samples of water from the swimming pool, and 6 samples of desiccated coconut were submitted to the Laboratory.

Arising out of the receipt of a letter from a large firm of Bakers and Confectioners in a neighbouring borough, six samples were taken from bakehouses in this district of desiccated coconut. With one exception all samples were satisfactory and the unsatisfactory sample referred to fine desiccated coconut in which salmonella newport was shown to be present. The bacteriologists stated that this product should not be used unless it was heat treated and these instructions were passed on to the bakers concerned. 46• SECTION F PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria There were no cases of diphtheria during the year. This was the tenth successive year in which the borough was free from this disease. Primary and secondary immunisation against this disease was carried out to the following extent in children under 15 years of age:- Primary immunisations - under 5 years - 551 " " - 5 to 15 years - 55 Total - 606 Number receiving secondary or reinforcing injections - 190 Scarlet Fever There was quite a marked increase in this disease during I960, the number of notified cases being 138, a rise of 60 above the previous year. All the cases were of a mild character. The following table indicates the cases notified during the past five years and the percentage of cases removed to hospital:- 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 Confirmed cases 65 54 37 78 138 Percentage removed to hospital 26 9 nil 5 3 Measles No more than 26 cases were notified. None needed admission to hospital. Measles serum was available to medical practitioners on application to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for the treatment of cases and protection of contacts. Whooping Cough There were 93 notifications of this disease. The number of children receiving a full course of immunisation against this condition in 1960 was 252. 47. Acute Poliomyelitis It is most satisfactory to report that there were no cases of poliomyelitis in the borough during the year. Vaccination against this disease was accepted by 1,740 persons, whilst 4,458 persons received reinforcing injections. Tuberculosis The exceptionally low figure of 14 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis is the lowest since 1932. In addition there were 2 persons notified as suffering from non-pulmonary tuberculosis. Seventeen tuberculous persons (16 pulmonary, 1 non-pulmonary) took up residence here from other districts. The declining prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in the borough is indicated by the following table of new cases for the past 15 years:- Year: 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 Cases: 45 46 42 34 36 44 30 39 Year: 1954 19 55 1956 1957 1958 1959 I960 Cases: 30 20 20 32 17 21 14 In England and Wales the figure for new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in I960 was 21,130. It will be appreciated therefore that the control of this disease still remains a very formidable task. Every effort must be made to find the unknown cases in the community and to bring them under supervision and control. In the school health service 280 children aged 13 years received B.C.G. vaccination out of 501 whose parents were asked to consent to this procedure. The Walthamstow and Chingford Association of Tuberculosis Care Helpers gave assistance wherever possible to patients and their families who suffered financial loss through the need for prolonged treatment at home or in hospital. This assistance was mostly in the form of groceries, fuel, clothing and holidays. The contribution which the Chingford Borough Council makes annually to this Association is very much appreciated. 48. Mass Radiography The mass radiography unit visited the borough during September. The following chart gives the full details of this survey:- Total number X-rayed Male Female Total 838 1147 1985 LOCATION Royston Arms 105 104 209 Prince Albert 335 428 763 Prince of Wales 104 122 226 Bull & Crown 294 493 787 838 1147 1985 PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS Requiring immediate treatment 4 - 4 Requiring occasional clinic supervision - 1 1 Presumed healed, no further action required 1 1 2 AMONG- OTHER ABNORMALITIES DISCOVERED WERE: Cancer of the bronchus 1 1 2 Congenital abnormalities of heart & vessels - 1 1 Acquired abnormalities of heart & vessels 1 1 2 Pulmonary fibrosis - non tuberculous 2 - 2 Pleural thickening or calcification - 1 1 Congenital abnormalities of bony thorax 1 1 2 Abnormality of diaphragm 1 - 1 Dysentery The annual prevalence of this condition - there were 43 cases compared to 16 in 1959 - indicates, as I have stressed in several previous reports, that a serious lack of personal hygiene exists in these instances, more especially a failure to wash the hands after each visit to the toilet or before preparing and eating food. This condition, which is very infectious, can be controlled - or very largely controlled - by the simple procedure I have indicated. Food Poisoning Only one case was notified. It was not possible to discover the organism concerned. 49. Food Hygiene The Health Inspectors continued their close attention to all food premises in the borough. Vaccination 443 persons received primary vaccination and 151 were revaccinated against smallpox during the year. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47: Care of .Aged and Chronic Sick. There were no cases needing statutory action under this section. In several instances the provision of a home help obviated the need for hospital care or admission to an old persons' home. (b) Section 50: No burials needed to be arranged by the Council under Section 50. Medical Examinations During the year 105 examinations were carried out by me in respect of Chingford Council staff and 29 in respect of staff of the Essex County Council.
