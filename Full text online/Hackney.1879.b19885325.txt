AC 4365 HAC 59 Board of Works for the Hackney District, REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAK 1879, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Member of the Royal Colleye of Physicians, Edin., & Secretary of the Meteorological Society; Vice-President of the Society of Public Analysts, and of the Haekney Microscopical Society ; Member of Council of Medical Officers of Health ; Author of Numerous Essays on Sanitary Statistics, &c. ; LONDON: A. T. ROBERTS, SON & CO., STEAM PRINTERS, 5, HACKNEY ROAD. 1880. Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for the District. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1879. TO THE BOARD OP WORKS FOR THE HACKNEY DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— This year was remarkable for a very low death-rate from most diseases, except inflammatory affections of the lungs; for low temperatures in winter and summer, and an excessive rainfall in most months, especially in summer. I have on several occasions pointed out the intimate relations that exist between a high summer temperature and an excessive mortality from diarrhœa, and vice versa, especially in infants; but whilst I am not in a position to state the precise cause or causes of summer diarrhoea, I may say that there is strong evidence to show that a high temperature continued for some time induces a fermentative or putrefactive change in organic matter, either with or without the presence of germs (some say of bacteria), which, being received into the body by the agency of air, water, or food, sets up this disease. I consider it to be of a specific character, and, unlike ordinary diarrhcea, to be but slightly dependent on the food taken, although unripe or decayed fruit or vegetables, decomposed milk-food, &c., will doubtless predispose to an attack, or may become the means of introducing the specific factor of the disease into the body. A microscopic examination of the contents of the traps in water-closets, and of the air in houses where the disease was prevalent, showed in many instances the presence of bacteroid forms which were absent in cold weather, and therefore the theory has been 4 pounded that this form of diarrhoea is caused by the carrying of these forms into the body by sewer air. An examination of the old bills of mortality made by Dr. Buchanan afford much support to this view, as in very many years deaths from this and cognate diseases were comparatively rare, although cesspits containing excreta existed on all premises, and house-drains were unknown. The death returns for London since the present system of registration has been in force also point to a similar conclusion, as in 1840, when connections between houses and the public sewers were much less common than now, there were only 452 deaths registered from diarrhoea, and during the next four years the average was only 680 ; whilst between 1869 and 1878 the smallest annual number was 2,479, viz., in 1877, and the highest, 3,894, in 1871; the mean of the ten years being 3,436, against 632 for the five years 1840-4. Although these facts cannot be considered sufficient to show that summer diarrhcea results from sewer gas containing organisms finding its way into houses, yet they certainly point to the necessity for frequent flushing of water-closets and drains with some disinfectant which retards or prevents putrefactive change, especially when the summer is unusually hot. As the infantile population suffers more in proportion to the number living from summer diarrhcea than older children and adults (and therefore should be better protected from the sun in summer), I have calculated out the mortality from this disease of infants under one year per 1,000,000 population in London living at all ages in the years 1860-62 ; also in the years 1874-79. The two former were calculated from the total deaths under 20 years, so that although they may not be quite correct, yet they are closely approximative. This table shows a very close correspondence between the mean temperature of the ten weeks in July, August, and early in September, and the mortality, an interval of one week being allowed for death to take place and be registered, which is, I think, sufficient, as summer diarrhoea is an acute disease. 5 Table I.

Thus in 1860, with a mean temperature of 58.1°, we find an infantile death.rate from diarrhcea of 151; and of 228 in 1879, with a temperature of 58.7°, against only 189 in 1862, with a mean temperature of 59.0°. In 1877, with a mean temperature of the air of 61.2°, and of the Thames water of 63.3°, the death. rate was 347 ; in 1874, with an air temperature of 61.7°, and of the Thames of 63.8°, there was a mortality of 4.47; in 1878, with an air temperature of 63.7°, and of the Thames of 64.1°, the death.rate increased to 576; and in 1876, with an air temperature of 64.4°, and of the Thames water of 64.9°, the death. rate under one year from diarrhœa rose as high as 642 per 1,000,000 inhabitants living at all ages. 6 The proportionate number of deaths at all ages from diarrhœa corresponds in different months pretty closely with those of infants, as I found that in three years only 39 per cent, of the deaths from this disease were registered in weeks having a temperature of 50°, and less; 11.9 per cent, in weeks having a temperature between 55° and 60°; and as many as 84.2 per cent, in weeks having a mean temperature above 60° Fahr.; and that in the 16 years 18.10.56 only 18.9 per cent, of all the deaths from diarrhoea were registered in spring and winter, against 81.1 per cent, in summer and autumn. In the 20 years 1860.79 there were 7 years in which the summer temperature was in defect, when the mortality at all ages from diarrhcea per 100,000 inhabitants of London was 200; in 10 summers during which it was in excess by less than 2°, the mortality was 317 per 100,000; and in three years when the temperature was more than 2° in excess, the mortality reached 339 per 100,000 inhabitants. These figures show that great care should be taken in hot weather to prevent diarrhœa, especially amongst young children, by frequent washing with soap and water to ensure cleanliness of the skin, and by wholesome food, good ventilation, especially of bed.rooms ; protection from the sun, avoidance of excessive exercise, frequent cleansing and disinfection of the drains, and by the removal of all animal and vegetable matter in a state of decomposition from the vicinity of dwelling.houses, especially when the mean air temperature of the week is above 60.5°, and of the Thames water more than Fahr. In connection with the recommendation to use disinfectants for the water.closets and drains in hot weather, I would point out that there are so many substances sold under this name which differ entirely in their action, that it may be useful if 1 make a few remarks on the subject. These articles may be divided into destructive, preservative, and deodorising agents, and I think the word . disinfectant . should be restricted to heat and the first.named class; that is to say, to those chemical compounds which destroy life. The preservatives, or anti.putre. 7 factives, ought not to be included with the others, as they seem only temporarily to prevent the chemical action of air on matter with which they are brought into contact, or suspend the specific power of infective material to induce disease. As regards deodorants, or oxydizing agents, they act in an entirely different manner to anti-putrefactives, and are useful in converting offensive (decomposing) organic matter into innocuous compounds but there is no evidence to show that they exercise any disinfecting action on the germs or particulate matter by which zymotic diseases are spread. Dry heat applied for several hours to infected bedding and clothes at a temperature of between 220° and 240° Fahr., with the addition of fumes of burning sulphur (sulphurous acid), has proved very effectual in this district, as nearly 15,000 articles have been disinfected in the apparatus belonging to the Board without an instance of infection having occurred from the articles returned to the owners. Next to heat, the best disinfectant is sulphurous acid, which may be obtained by burning sulphur in the infected rooms, l1b. being used for each 1,000 cubic feet of air. The chimney should be blocked up, the windows and doors of the room made air-tight before the sulphur is lighted, and the room be kept closed for at least four hours. Chlorine and nitrous acid gas are probably as effectual, but are not so easily and safely used ; also Burnett's fluid (chloride of zinc); sporokton, which evolves sulphurous acid gas; and euchlorine, which is, however, an expensive mode of obtaining chlorine, are destructive to the lower forms of life, as well as strong solutions of carbolic acid and like agents. Other chemical compounds are frequently used besides carbolic acid and similar tar products for disinfecting drains; also salts of iron, bichromate of potash, sanitas powder, &c. When carbolic acid is used, 1 part of the soluble acid should be added to 50 parts of hot water. This and other similar tar products are very useful in stopping putrefaction for a time, and are therefore suitable for use in drains, but are of very little avail as aerial disinfectants in a sick room; indeed the same may be said of all except the 8 oxydi/.ing agents, such as the permanganates, tereheres, and other compounds which give off oxygen or peroxide of hydrogen. Condy's fluid, sanitas, euchlorine, or thymol may be used for this purpose, and may be employed whilst the patient is in the room, great care being used with euchlorine that too much gas be not given off by the mixture of both sorts. These act as before stated by oxydizing decomposing organic matters in the air, by reducing them to harmless compounds, and thus removing what might otherwise afford a pabulum for the increase of infective matter. There are, however, other diseases during the progress of which the water-closets and drains should he regularly disinfected, chiefly small-pox, scarlet fever, typhoid and typhus fevers, as well as all discharges coming from the patient. Burnett's fluid, sporokton, strong solutions of sulphate of iron or zinc, or of carbolic acid (1 to 50) may be selected for this purpose; but if put into the vessel before use, they must be sufficiently diluted not to injure the patient by splashing. The number of articles and of rooms disinfected during the year was not so large as for some preceding years, in consequence of the great reduction in the number of small-pox cases, and to a less extent of most other infectious diseases, except whooping cough and measles, for which disinfection is not ordinarily employed. The disinfecting chamber has been used to a considerable extent, as 95 beds, 111 mattresses and palliasses, 255 bolsters and pillows, 357 blankets, sheets, and quilts, as well as 472 ether articles, were disinfected at the Board's apparatus during the year. The cost of disinfecting the houses, clothing, &c., was as follows:—Wages, £56; coal and coke, £5 7s. 9d.; petty expenses, £5 6s. 1d.; and about £9 for disinfectants supplied to the poor for washing floors, linen, &c., and for pouring down drains and water-closets, and disinfecting the discharges of the few patients who were treated at home. Against this amount 9 of £66 13s. 10d. has to be credited the sum of £14 13s. received from persons who could afford to pay for disinfection of their clothes and houses. The whole of the gullies in the district were also disinfected, some more than once; numerous dead animals, putrid fish, and offensive offal were removed and buried by the men employed for disinfection, and the whole of the public and private urinals were tarred by the same men under the direction of the inspectors. The number of smallpox cases brought to our notice during the year was only 35, of which 17 occurred in 6 houses, and 18 in 18 houses; that is to say, in the latter, one case occurred in a house. The disease, in all instances except one, was confined to one house in a street, which I attribute to the active disinfection, the speedy removal of the sick, or their strict isolation, and the re-vaccination of the inmates in many of the houses. In these houses where two or more cases occurred, we were not informed of the first case, so that the others were infected before we could interfere. In two instances the parents refused to allow their children to be removed to the hospital, but on a threat being made that I would apply to a magistrate, they were induced to let them go. We were not able to trace the source of infection in more than two instances; in one a man worked in a house situated in another parish that had been lately occupied by a smallpox patient, and had not been disinfected. In the other, a cake and book were sent by a person recovering from smallpox to a child, who had premonitory symptoms a few days afterwards, and the rash on the twelfth day. These cases show the danger of sending books, &c., from an infected room to healthy people, and also of working in infected rooms. During the year 51 cases of typhoid fever were reported to me, and a special examination of the drains and water-supply apparatus in all the houses was made by the Senior Inspector, but in four houses only were defective drains discovered, and in no instance was there any defect in the water-supply apparatus. In two cases death was attributed to foul-smelling sewer openings 10 in front of the houses, but as only one case occurred in each house or in the neighbourhood, this could scarcely be the cause. In another a builder was said to have contracted the disease from superintending drain work. There were several instances of persons coming home ill with the disease, viz., from Twickenham, Margate, the Boys' Home at Bow, and from Dulwich. There was not any instance of a second case occurring in the same house, or of an endemic in any street, the cases being scattered nearly all over the district. Twenty-eight of the patients were females, and twenty-three males. The number of houses in which diphtheria occurred was 18. In 14 of these no defects in the water-supply apparatus or drainage were discovered, but in two the drains were defective, and allowed the entrance of sewer gas into the houses, and in two others there were overflow pipes from the cisterns which were connected with the drains. There was only one case in each house. In August last I reported to you the occurrence of numerous cases of severe diarrhcea, vomiting and prostration from eating dripping sold by an itinerant vendor. My attention was directed to the cases by the medical attendant of two families who thought they had been poisoned by impure water. I inspected the houses and heard the accounts given by the parents, when I came to the conclusion, as the drainage and water supply were good, that the disease was caused by eating dripping bought at the door. I called, so far as I know, at all the houses where the dripping had been supplied, and found 29 cases living in four streets, two at a rather considerable distance from the others. Nearly all suffered who partook of it, and there were no similar cases amongst the residents of these streets except those just mentioned. The symptoms were great prostration, severe vomiting and purging, cramp, severe pain in the stomach, great subsequent debility, and in some cases fever, lasting for several days. There was only one death, viz., that of an infant who was suckling, but 11 who did not, it was believed, have any dripping. Another infant suffered in the same way, but recovered. The sickness and diarrhoea came on in most cases a few hours (from four to twelve) after eating the dripping, those suffering most severely who partook of the jelly. I carefully examined the dripping chemically and microscopically. It had a peculiar and faint smell, but I did not detect anything except numerous small microscopic organisms resembling monads. The symptoms corresponded very closely to those that occurred some years ago amongst numerous residents of this district who ate some sausages, and of whom one died. Having made these few remarks on summer diarrhoea, typhoid fever, smallpox and disinfectants, I shall lay before you several tables showing the growth of population, the births, deaths and marriages in the district during the last ten years, and the mortality at different ages from various diseases during the current year, as well as an account of the sanitary work performed during the year.

That the actual population is not much, if at all, less than the calculated number, viz., 178,750, is shown by the number of births, which was no less than 6,312 in 1879, against 4029 in 1870, or 33.3 per 1,000 population in 1870, against 35.9 in 1879. It is probably true that a larger proportion of married persons now inhabit the newly built (smaller) houses than obtained in 1869, owing to the exodus of working people from other parts of London to the comparatively cheaper residences in this district; but I do not think that this would cause a greater difference than that mentioned above, viz., 35.9 against 33.3 per 1,000 population. The number of deaths has not increased so greatly as the births, which, as the density of the population has become much greater, shows a satisfactory sanitary condition of the district. As pointed out in my last report, the number of applications for the drainage of newly built houses corresponds very closely, if they be multiplied by 6.5 (the proportion of inhabitants to each house), with the number of new houses which would be required to provide accommodation for the calculated number of added population.

The population in 1871, as enumerated at the census, was 9.841, and of inhabited houses 1,556, the number of births registered in 1S71 being 316, against 819 in 1879. The population of Hackney Parish I estimate to have been 152,920 on July 1, 1879, and of Stoke Newington 22,830, which would give a birth rate of 35.9 per 1,000 population in each parish. The birth rate in 1871 was nearly the same in both parishes, and assuming that the number of persons to a house remains the same as at the time of the census, this calculation cannot be far from correct. There were 300 births registered in Stamford Hill Sub.district, or 4.8 per cent, of the whole ; 1,331 in West Hackney, or 21.1 per cent.; 2,359, or 37.4 per cent., in Hackney; and 1,497 in South Hackney, or 23.7 per cent, of the total number of births in the whole district. The largest number of births, as usual, were registered during the first quarter, next in the last, and the smallest in the third quarter. Table IV.

The number here given will not agree with those returned in the 14 annual summary of the Registrar-General, as the deaths in fiftythree weeks have to be included this year in his figures, because they are compiled from the weekly returns, whilst mine include only those which occurred during the year, the date of death and not of registration being taken. The deaths also of small-pox and fever cases coming from other parishes are included in the Registrar-General's return, but are excluded from my tables. Corrections will be doubtless made hereafter in an annual report for these and other deaths, but they are not made in earlier returns, so that Hackney appears to have a larger death-rate than really belongs to it. I have not calculated out the death-rate for the different sub-districts of Hackney, as the German Hospital, the City of London Union, the Hackney Union Workhouse, and the Small-pox and Fever Hospitals, are all included in the Hackney Sub-district, and the necessary corrections might therefore lead to considerable error. This is especially likely to occur, as, with the exception of Stoke Newington, there are no reliable data on which to calculate the increase of population, the wards or collectors' districts not corresponding with the registration subdistricts. The table shows that there were 338 deaths registered in Stoke Newington, against 165 in 1871 ; 142 in Stamford Hill, against 100 in 1871; 645 in West Hackney, against 631 ; 1,453 in Hackney, against 1,313 in 1871; and 707 in South Hackney, against 605 in 1871. There were 970 deaths registered during the first quarter; 825 in the second; only 60S in the third; and 882 in the fourth. The small proportion in the third quarter arose chiefly from the diminished number of deaths from diarrhoea, whilst the large number in the first quarter was caused by the unusual severity of the winter and consequent mortality from bronchitis. It is probable that several years will elapse before so small a comparative mortality will be registered in the summer quarter. 15 Table V.

In 1878 the percentage of deaths from constitutional diseases was 18.2, against 19.1 in 1879 ; from "Local"causes, 45.1 in 1878, against 52.0 in 1879; from developmental causes, 12.5, against 12.5; and from violence, 2.6 in 1878, against only 1.8 per cent, in 1879. The number under one year to total deaths was decidedly smaller than in 1878, and 16 the percentage to total deaths was below the average for 1S66.75, but higher than for the 10 years 1856.65, the figures being 23.4, 24.3, and 21.0. The reduction in the mortality of children under one year arose chiefly from the unusually small number of deaths from summer diarrhcea, as there were only 53 deaths registered from this cause under one year of age, against 122 in 1868. The number of deaths from the whooping cough, although above the mean of ten years, was much below that for 1878, viz., 37, against 57. As before stated, the diminished number of deaths from summer diarrhoea is attributable to the low summer temperature ; but even after allowing for this, the small excess of death.rate at 0.1 years above that for 1855.65 is very satisfactory, when the great increase in the density of our population, and the different class of the bulk of our present inhabitants, are taken into consideration. At the next age period, 1 .5 years, the percentage to deaths at all ages more closely approximates to that for 1856.65, having been 16.1, against 16.4; whilst for 5.15 it was much below the means, having been only 4.2, against 5.3 in 1866.75, and 5.1 in 1856.65. The same remark applies to the age periods of 15.25 and 25.35. At the next age periods, of 35.45, 45.55, and 55.65, the mortality was, as might have been expected,in excess of the means for the two preceding decennials, chiefly in consequence of the unusually large number of deaths from inflammatory diseases of the lungs at those age periods. At 65.75 the proportion of deaths was larger than in 1866.75, but smaller than in 1856.65, and was smaller for the ages above 75 than in former years, most probably because we have not now so large a proportion of elderly people in our population as we had at the time of the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act. There were 153 inhabitants who died at 80 years or above, being 3 less than in 1878, but there was only one death above 95, whilst in 1878 as many as 5 were registered as being of a more advanced age than 95. There were 22 between 80 and 81; 13 between 81 and 82; 20 between 82 and 83 ; 18 between 83 and 84; 1 between 84 and 85; 14 between 85 and 86; 11 17 between 86 and 87; 12 between 87 and 88; 6 between 88 and 89; and 4 between 89 and 90. There were 16 who were more than 90 years of age, viz., 3 of 90.91; 4 of 91.92; 2 of 92.93; 3 of 93.94; 4 of 94.95; and 1 between 95 and 96 years of age. As there were 153 deaths above 80 years of age out 3,285, the percentage of deaths at those ages (80.95) was 4.6 per cent, of the deaths at all ages. Table VI.

This table shows the alteration in the death rates during three years from certain groups of diseases which are generally considered to indicate the sanitary condition of a population, and has been inserted for comparison with other districts. The percentage of deaths to total deaths from zymoties was smaller than in any previous year, but that from tubercular diseases, as might have been expected (because they vary less than almost any other), was proportionately larger, whilst, from pulmonary diseases the 18 mortality was very great. Convulsive diseases of infants produced a relatively larger mortality than in 1878, but from wasting diseases of infants the death.rate was smaller; that from the two together being nearly identical. When the number of deaths is compared with population, which is much the best test, we find that there were only 2.61 deaths from all zymotic diseases per 1,000 population, which is very small, the death.rate from the seven chief zymotic diseases in all England having been 2.39 per 1,000. From tubercular diseases there were 8.68 deaths per 1,000, against 2.90 in 1877 and 1878; but the mortality from inflammatory pulmonary diseases was as high as 4.53 per 1,000, against 3.42 and 3.68 in 1877 and 1878. The death.rate from wasting and convulsive diseases of infants was 2.25 per 1,000 population, against 2.23 in 1878, and 2.60 in 1877. Table VII.

The deaths from measles have not varied so greatly, the smallest number registered in any of these years having been 15 in 1876, and the largest 91 in 1877, against 86 in 1878, and 81 in 1879. We have had an epidemic of this disease for the last three years, which is therefore likely to pass away. Scarlet fever has not prevailed so much as as usual, as there were only 70 deaths recorded in 1879, against an uncorrected average in 10 years of 100. There was a rather severe epidemic in 1878, so that we may expect a smaller number of deaths in 1880 than there were even in 1879. The largest mortality during the period under consideration was 247 in 1869, and the smallest 27 in 1873. The deaths from diphtheria are by no means numerous in the district, as the largest number registered in 1869.79 was 23, viz., in 1876, and the smallest 7, in 1872, against 19 in 1879. Whooping cough has been singularly fatal not only in Hackney, but in the whole of London for some time, as there were 123 deaths registered in Hackney during 1878. and 110 in 1879, against an uncorrected average of 86 for 20 the 10 years. The greatest number in one year occurred in 1878, and the smallest in 1870. Fever was less prevalent in 1879 than usual, 47 deaths having been registered, against an average of 53, or if corrected for increase of population, of 63. There were three deaths returned as arising from typhus fever, two of which certainly were not typhus, and one so very doubtful that I registered it from inflammation of the lungs, which was returned as a concurrent disease—"Typhus three days, congestion of lungs; " aged 8. In another case the certificate was, "Typhus five days, cirrhosis of liver, ascites (dropsy)," aged 16, clearly not a case of typhus. The third was somewhat similar. There was another case of " fever" which I registered as brain disease, the certificate being, " continued fever three days, brain disease eight days," in a child aged three years. I made personal enquiry as to all the deaths from typhus, and into those from fever and small.pox, whenever the report of the inspector made me consider such a visit desirable. I also went to several houses where there was a difficulty in obtaining the removal to the hospital of children affected with small.pox or scarlet fever. As regards diarrhoea, I have already discussed the mortality from this disease, and need only say that the annual average number of deaths (corrected) for 1869.70 was 145, against only 67 in 1879. The death.rates from these seven zymotic diseases per 1,000 population were 2.29 in Hackney, 3.35 in London, and 2.39 in England and Wales, which are much below the average. The death.rates from these diseases have been on the decline in England and Wales since 1870, as the average in 1851.60 was 4.11; in 1861.70, 4.14 ; and in 1871.79 it was only 3.37 per 1,000 inhabitants. The mortality from fever has been reduced from 0.91 and 0.88 in 1851.60 and 1861.70 to 0.51 per 1,000 in 1871.79. 21 Table VIII.

The mean annual proportions of births to 100 deaths in these periods were 146,159, 156, and 175, being as high as 192 in 1879. The number of births to population has also increased steadily, showing that a larger proportion of women at child-bearing ages arc now living in the district, viz., 28.3 births to 1,000 population in 1841-50; 31.8 in 1851-60; 33.8 in 1861-70; and 34 6 in 1871-79. As might be expected, the deaths under 1 year to 1,000 births have increased, partly owing to increased density of population, but chiefly to the much larger proportion of the working and lower middle classes now residing in the district, amongst whom the number of deaths of young children, to births, is always larger than amongst the upper and upper middle classes. In 1841-50 the proportion was only 127; in 1851-60 it was 128; in 1861-70 it rose rapidly to 143; whilst for the nine years 1871-79 it was only 142, against 158 for all London, which may be deemed satisfactory, especially as in 1879 it was as low as 122, against 147. The death-rate from all causes in 1879 was singularly low, viz., 18.7 per 1,000 population, against 23.2 for all London. I may perhaps have scarcely allowed a sufficient number for deaths in extraneous hospitals, but as I have included all our deaths in the Small-pox, Fever, and German Hospitals, and added on 127 deaths of non-residents in the German Hospital, &c., I cannot be far wrong. The death-rate per 1,000 population from the seven chief zymotic diseases in Hackney was less in 1871-79 than in 1851-60 and 1861-70, and was only 2.29, against 3.46 for the nine years 1871-79, and 3.87 for the same period for all London. In the early part of the year two caravans of gypsies settled in a yard near High-street, Kingsland, to the great annoyance of the residents, and I tried ineffectually to obtain their removal 23 until I procured from the Sanitary Committee an order to serve a notice on the owner of the yard to provide proper privy accommodation connected with the sewer, and also a fit and proper water supply and apparatus for scouring the same. As this would have entailed a large expense, the owner gave the gypsies notice to leave, which they did forthwith. I have also procured the removal of several offensive trades which were newly established in the district during the year. Amongst them were two premises on which the skins of fish were cleaned and dried, during which a most offensive smell was given off, as the skins were by no means sweet when brought to the premises. The service of a notice, after personal inspection by myself, with the threat of a prosecution, induced the occupiers to remove elsewhere. A large pickle maker was also compelled to remove, as the smell on opening barrels imported from Holland was often most offensive (the vegetables having only been packed in brine), and were sometimes decayed. In this latter case I had to visit the premises several times. I have also with much difficulty obtained the closing of three large shoots where decaying vegetable and other offensive matters were deposited, as they were near to houses, and induced diarrhoea, and in one instance, it was believed, diphtheria. These places are very difficult to deal with, owing to the peculiar state of the law, but as the district is being rapidly built over, we shall possibly be less annoyed by them in future. I have inspected several places which were in a barely habitable state, partly from dilapidations, and parly owing to structural defects, and have been able to procure a great amendment in their condition by notices served under the Nuisances Removal Act, with a threat that if the requisite works were not carried out the provisions of the Artisans and Labourers Dwellings (Torrens') Amendment Act would be enforced. There are some places now under notice which will be improved, but owing to the houses not being closely surrounded by others, it is impossible to show by statistics that they are unhealthy, as the death- 24 rate is not above, indeed is rather below, that of persons of a similar class occupying better houses in other and more densely populated parts of the district. I have attended several meetings, and also formed part of a deputation to Mr. Sclater-Booth on the subject of providing hospital accommodation for non-pauper cases. This question hinges to a great extent on the definition of a pauper, but partly also on the manner in which the Acts of Parliament are to be carried out. I stated my opinion, with which Mr. Sclater-Booth concurred, that any person being sick with a dangerous infectious disorder, and not having a residence of his or her own, or the means of procuring one, and not having the means of providing proper medical attendance, necessaries and nursing, is a pauper, and should be removed to a hospital belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board; that, on the contrary, a person having a house and the money necessary to provide medical attendance, medicines, food and nursing, is not a pauper, so that if it were necessary to isolate such a person he or she should, according to the Act, be removed by the Sanitary Authority. This definition of a pauper has been acted upon at all times by the Guardians for this district, otherwise we should have suffered much more severely from small-pox than we have done, and it is therefore an error to say, as the managers of the Asylums Board have done, that nearly 90 per cent. of the persons treated in their hospitals were non-paupers. My own opinion is, as I have often stated, that the removal should in all cases be effected through the Relieving Officer, and on the certificate of any duly qualified medical practitioner, and that if it were deemed right to charge the Sanitary Authority with the cost, they should defray it and recover the amount from the person removed, or by the Guardians, who can sue non-paupers for the costs and expenses incurred in their removal and treatment. Of course this would be claimed only in cases where the persons so removed could have paid for all necessaries, including nursing and medical attendance, which would be very few. My chief reason for this opinion is that much time 25 might be lost by applying to the wrong officer; and as the cost of maintenance, &c., for a pauper is thrown on the whole of the Metropolis, whilst for a non-pauper it is thrown on the district or parish, the Sanitary Officer would have to make the necessary enquiries, and satisfy himself that the patient could pay, before issuing his order for removal. During the whole of the late epidemic every person applying to me was removed at his own cost or that of his friends, or was subsequently removed by the Relieving Officer, although I was empowered to take any applicant, not being a pauper, to the Islington Small-pox Hospital at the expense of the Board. In 1871-72, when we had beds in a small-pox hospital, most of the patients admitted there on my order were paupers, who objected to go to the newly opened Asylums Board's hospitals. We have not therefore been injured by want of a hospital of our own, as all persons suffering from infectious disease of which I have been informed were, if necessary, removed, provided they were in a fit condition for removal, which many were not, in consequence of the disease being in an advanced stage. The inspections of the cowsheds have occupied an unusually large amount of time this year, in consequence of the cowkeepers scarcely knowing what to do to satisfy the requirements of the Officers of this Board and of the Metropolitan Board of Works. In most instances two or three inspections were made by the Committee and myself, besides the visits of the Inspector, and it was only by opposing the granting of the licenses to a considerable number that the works we required were done. Several cowkeepers had their licenses refused eventually, because they did not consider it would pay them to make the necessary alterations and amendments. The regulations have not been strictly carried out as regards the cubical space for each cow, because the cowkeepers were not able in all instances to enlarge their sheds, but next year they will be strictly enforced, especially as where proper means of ventilation are provided the space has been reduced to 600 cubic feet for each cow. One license was refused 26 because a loft over it was used as a workshop, and two applications for new sheds were successfully objected to because they were within twenty feet of inhabited dwelling-houses. As many as twenty-one meetings of the View Committee were held, chiefly in connection with the licenses to cowsheds, and twenty-nine meetings of the Sanitary Committee have also been held, making fifty-nine Committee meetings, all of which I attended. The removal of the dust has been satisfactorily carried out by the new contractors; Mr. Jackson having removed 10,207 loads from the north-western district, and Mr. Stevens 9,543 from the south-eastern, making a total of 19,750 loads removed against 18,129 in 1878, and 18,623 in 1877. The contract price for the removal is 2s. per load in the south-eastern, and 1s. 11d. per load in the north-western, the dust being the property of the contractor, one of our men in each sub-division of the district, assisting in the removal from the houses, and also under the orders of the dust inspector directing the drivers of the carts where to go. The total cost, including our own men's wages and the dust inspector's salary, was £2,593 13s 6d., being a reduction of £150 on the sum paid in 1878. The number of dust complaints and requests to remove dust was 2,296, of which the greatest part were merely requests to have the dust removed on a certain day. This is a small number compared with the returns in some other parishes, and shows that the present system of having the house refuse removed at a fixed price per load by my directions, and under the immediate supervision of the dust inspector, answers very well. The inspection of the smaller houses in the district which are to a considerable extent occupied by two or more families was carried out as usual. There were 6,025 houses inspected, containing 26,731 rooms, 9,077 families, and 39,509 persons; so that there Were about 3 families to every 2 houses, and 6.57 persons in each house. I consider that one of the reasons for the slight increase in the death-rate, as compared with the increased density of population, is owing to the great number of small 27 houses and the comparatively small number of persons to a house. The vicinity of the marshes and Victoria Park to our inhabited houses, and the existence of other open spaces in our midst which cannot be built over, will, I trust, always go far to counteract the ordinary effects of the increase in the number of our population and houses. The number of small houses within which the occurrence of infectious disease was reported to this department was only 118, and in other houses 131, making a total of 249, which is less than usual. Most of the latter cases occurred amongst servants and others residing in better class houses. The number of houses on which nuisances were found was, as usual, more than one-third of the 6,025, showing the value of a systematic house to house inspection every year. In addition to these, we received intimation of the existence of nuisances in 629 houses, so that only 26 per cent. of the nuisances in dwelling houses were brought to our notice by complaint, and 74 per cent. by inspection. In the appendix will be found details of the various kinds of nuisances abated during the year. These may be briefly described as 1,113 nuisances arising from defective drainage, 529 of which consisted of choked or defective drains. The number of houses that were cleansed, whitewashed and repaired, amounted to 2,278; of houses in which the water supply apparatus to the closets was improved or repaired was 557 ; of yards in which the paving was relaid, 236; and where new dust-bins were provided, 236 ; making a total of 2,838 nuisances abated in houses or in the adjoining yards and water-closets. There were 24.9 houses disinfected; 30 cases of overcrowding abated; 201 accumulations (excluding dust) of stable manure, vegetable matter, &c., removed; and 459 other nuisances removed. To effect this, as many as 6,004 notices were served and letters written, and 31 summonses were taken out. In addition to these there were 86 cowsheds inspected, most of them on several oc-asions; 49 slaughter-houses, 262 greengrocers, fishmongers, and poulterer's yards inspected, and also 178 bakehouses. In connection with these, I desire to state 28 that the whole of the sanitary staff have performed their work to my satisfaction. I would also mention in connection with the staff, that another inspector died during the year, making the fourth death since 1866, when the system of a regular house to house inspection was commenced. Three out of the four inspectors were in the prime of life, and died from diseases of the lungs. The weather of 1879 was most remarkable for cold and wet. The cold set in on the 2nd of January, and, with the exception of two days, continued below the mean up to February 2, the the average deficiency for this period being more than 5 degrees. During the next fortnight the weather was unusually warm, the average excess being equal in amount to the previous deficiency, causing a very great change in the weather. A cold period again set in on the 17th, and lasted until March 3rd, the mean daily temperature being about 4 degrees below the average. March was also a variable month, being mostly warm up to the 21st, when another cold week occurred, with snow, the average daily deficiency being 7½ degrees. The lowest temperatures recorded at Greenwich were, in January, 19.4°; in February, 24.5° ; and in March, 29.2°. In Hackney they were, 21.2° in January; 25.4° in February; and 29.0° in March. The mean temperature of the air for January at Greenwich was 31.9°, being the lowest recorded since 1838. The coldest months of January sincc 1771 are as follows In 1771, when the mean temperature for the month was 29.9°; in 1774, 31.5°; in 1776, 27.0°; in 1780, 28.6°; in 1784, 20.2°; in 1795, 23.9°; in 1814, 26.9°; in 1815, 31.9°; in 1820, 31.7°; in 1823, 31.8°; in 1829, 31.7°; in 1830, 30.7°; in 1838, 28.9°; and in 1879, 31.9°. The second quarter of the year was no better, being cold, wet, and comparatively sunless, as the mean daily temperature was below the average on 74 days out of the 91, having been only 45.9° for the quarter. Th is is the lowest recorded since 1837, when it was 48.3°, and with eight other exceptions, the coldest since 1771. There were frosts in both April and May, 28.6°, or nearly 3½ degrees or frost, 29 having been noted on the 12th of April. The third quarter was comparatively more unseasonable even than the second, the mean temperature of July being 4 deg., of August 1.6 deg., and of September nearly 1 deg. below the average, so that the mean for the eleven months ending September 30th was, with the exception of 1813-14 and 1814-15, the lowest recorded during the whole of the present century. The last quarter of the year was no exception as regards cold, the mean temperature of December having been only 32.4 deg., against 31.9 deg. in January, and 39.l degrees for the preceding 108 years. November also was 4 degrees below the average of 108 years. October was comparatively fine, but even in that month the temperature was below the average. The lowest temperatures recorded at my house during November and December were as follows: viz., in November, 23.2 degrees, and in December, 11.4 degrees. The rainfall was 2.38 inches in January; 3.36 inches in February; 0.74 inches in March; 2.39 inches in April; 3.24 inches in May; 3.89 inches in June; 3.0 inches in July; as much as 4.58 inches in August; 2.61 inches in September; 0.97 inches in October; 0.86 inches in November; and 0.80 inches in December, making a total of 29.02 inches in the year, which, as the gauge is more than six feet above the ground, is less than would have been recorded if it had been placed on the grass. There were two days on which an inch of rain or more fell, viz., on May 29th and September 24th, the amount on the latter day having reached 1.28 inches, so that it was not so much the heavy as the very frequent rainfall that brought up the total to so large an amount.
