To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith, in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1912. The Mortality Statistics for the year are, on the whole, somewhat better than for 1911, but, at the same time, a similar improvement has been general throughout London, and, accordingly, our comparative position remains the same. The Birth Rate is 25·01 per 1,000 for Greenwich and 24·7 for the whole of the County of London. The recorded Death Rate of 13·20 per 1,000 of the estimated population, being only just under 13·6 per 1,000, the Death Rate for the County of London, and 13·8 per 1,000, the figure for the 95 large towns. The Death Rate for Greenwich corrected according to difference of age and sex constitution in the population, as revealed by the recent Census enumeration, equals 12·9 per 1,000. Comparing Greenwich with the other Metropolitan Boroughs according to their corrected Death Rate, which is the fairest method of comparison, shows that Greenwich has the lowest Death Rate but 9 amongst the 29 Metropolitan Boroughs. The 9 Boroughs having a better Death Rate than Greenwich being Hampstead, Lewisham, Wandsworth, Stoke Newington, Woolwich, Paddington, Camberwell, Hackney, Battersea. Comparing our relative position with that of last year it will be seen that we occupy exactly the same place among the other Metropolitan Boroughs in regard to our corrected Death Rate, 11 so that, as stated above, although we have slightly improved, yet this improvement has been general throughout London, and, accordingly, our comparative position remains the same. Full particulars of all the Boroughs in this respect are to be found in the table on pages 18 and 19. The Infantile Mortality Rate for the Borough measured by the number of deaths under one year to 1,000 births registered was 84, a decrease of 45 compared with last year; the figure for London as a whole was 91, and the Borough average during the last five years, 1907-11, inclusive, 114. The Zymotic Death Rate of 1.21 is 1.26 per 1,000 below the corresponding figure for last year. This decrease in the Zymotic Death Kate is practically all accounted for by the fewer number of deaths from Diarrhœa in Greenwich during this year. The figures relating to the different constituent parts of the Borough are as follows:— Districts. Birth Rate. Death Rate. Percentage of deaths under one year of age. Infantile Mortality per 1,000 Births. Zymotic Death Rate. Diarrhœa Death Rate. sumption Death Rate.

The further question of dealing with Infant Diarrhœa during the hot weather was dealt with in a tentative manner by the appointment of an additional Woman Inspector in a temporary capacity during the summer months. This year it is proposed to enlist the services of the various District Ranyard and St. John the Divine Nurses to carry out this work in a systematic manner throughout the whole of the Borough all the year round. During the compiling of this report definite steps are being taken to provide an Infant Consultation in East Greenwich, for which purpose a Representative Committee of ladies interested in such work has been formed, and the Consultation is to be opened at the beginning of June. In conclusion I have again to tender my best thanks to each and all Members of the Council, and the Public Health Committee in particular, for their continued kindness and support, and also to the Members of the Staff for the manner in which their duties have been performed. I am, Gentlemen, Yours respectfully, ERNEST G. ANNIS. 13 VITAL AND MORTAL STATISTICS, 1912. POPULATION. The number of persons estimated to be living at the middle of the year is 95,992. This estimate is an increase of ten upon the corresponding figure of last year. Up to the present time the complete Census reports have not been received from the Registrar-General. We have only been favoured with a total of the population enumerated in the Borough at the recent Census for the purpose of the statistical returns. Full details will be supplied later. During the year the Registrar-General, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, has made certain slight alterations in the boundaries of the registration sub-districts of East and West Greenwich, in so far as the entire North-West and South Wards of the Borough of Greenwich are transferred from Greenwich East to Greenwich West. This order coming into force on 1st June, 1912. The distribution of the population throughout the Borough is as follows:— Census, 1911. Estimated Population at middle of year 1912. East Greenwich 45,963 46,202 West Greenwich 22,936 22,868 St. Nicholas 7,291 7,286 Charlton 16,911 16,783 Kidbrooke 2,876 2,853 Total 95,977 95,992 MARRIAGES. The Superintendent-Registrar of the Greenwich Union has kindly furnished me with the particulars relating to the number 14 of marriages solemnized in the Parishes of Greenwich and St. Nicholas. The Superintendent-Registrar for the Woolwich Union has also kindly supplied the particulars for the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrooke, with the exception, in these latter particulars, that none of the marriages performed in the Woolwich Registrar's Office and in Chapels in Charlton and Kidbrooke, of residents in those Parishes, are included. The following table shows these particulars, giving the number of marriages in Greenwich and St. Nicholas, etc., for each year since 1893. Year. In Churches of England in in Greenwich.

The total number of Births in the Borough during the year has been 2,367, but of these, 63 occurred in the Greenwich Union Infirmary, the address of the mother being in 39 instances in Deptford and one in Walthamstow. Deducting these and adding 66 15 which were transferred from Lambeth, St. Marylebone and Woolwich, it will be seen that the number of strictly Greenwich births for 1912 is 2,393, of which 1,231 were males and 1,162 females. This corrected figure gives a Birth Rate of 25.01 per 1,000 of the population, being 1.96 below the average for the last eleven years, 1901 to 1911, the period since the formation of the Metropolitan Borough. Amongst the total number of births registered in the Borough there were 76 in which the name of the father was not registered and therefore not given in the return; accordingly, these births may be presumed to be of an illegitimate character. 56 of such births were registered in the East Greenwich District, which includes the Infirmary of the Greenwich Union. In 23 cases the mother was ordinarily a resident in the Borough of Deptford, and accordingly this number of births have been transferred to that Borough. The remaining 53 were similarly allocated to the districts in this Borough in which the mother ordinarily resided, making 24 of such births belonging to East Greenwich, 19 to West Greenwich, 7 to St. Nicholas, and 3 to Charlton. The Birth Rate for the County of London equals 24.5 per 1,000 of the population. It varied from 9.9 in the City of London, 14.9 in Hampstead, 15.0 in the City of Westminster, 18.8 in Chelsea and Holborn, up to 30 0 in Finsbury, 30.6 in Bethnal Green, 30.9 in Stepney, 31.0 in Bermondsey, and 32.3 in Shoreditch. Under the provisions of the Notifications of Births Act, 1907, intimations have been received from medical men, parents, and others, with respect to 2,450 births, from which it will be seen that we have 57 intimations to be credited to births which were registered during the latter part of 1911, or will be registered during the early part of 1913, as the time allowed by law for registration purposes extends up to six weeks, whereas that under the Notification of Births Act is to be within 36 hours. 16 DEATHS. The total number of deaths registered during 1912 was 1,263, of which 699 were males and 564 females. The crude Death Rate for the Borough of 13.20 per 1,000 compares with 13.6, the Death Rate for the County of London, and 13.8, the Death Rate for the 95 large towns. In the County of London the lowest crude Death Rates amongst the various Metropolitan Boroughs were 9.8 in Hampstead, 11.4 in Lewisham, 11.6 in Woolwich, 12.1 in Hackney and Stoke Newington; while the highest rates were 16.4 in Poplar, 16.8 in Bermondsey, 18.1 in Shoreditch, 18.7 in Southwark, and 18.8 in Finsbury. Locally, the Death Rate varied from 5.63 in Kidbrooke, 10.88 in Charlton, 11.99 in East Greenwich, and 15.03 in West Greenwich, to 22.86 in St. Nicholas. The following table shows the variation in, and average of, the Death Rates in each of the five Districts of the Borough in the five years, 1907 to 1911, compared with the figures for 1912:— District. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910. 1911.

Such persons had no known fixed residence in England, and, unfortunately, died in the "Dreadnought" Hospital. There were also two deaths of soldiers in the Herbert Hospital, whose addresses were given as India and China respectively. 17 DEATHS IN INSTITUTIONS.

The Infantile Mortality, measured by the deaths of children under one year of age to the number of births registered, was 84 per 1,000 births, there having been a total of 200 such deaths during the year, as compared with 300, 310 and 259, the figures for the three preceding years. The number for the County of London was 91 per 1,000 births, the average for the past five years being 109 per 1,000 births. The average for the past five years in Greenwich has been 112 per 1,000 births, from which it will be seen that this year there have been 22 fewer deaths for each 1,000 births. The greater portion of this decreased fatality being due to the less number of deaths from Diarrhoea during the summer months. The following table gives the number and character of the intimations respecting births in the Borough since the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907:— NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. Date of adoption—17th March, 1909. 1909. 1910. 1911. 1912.

The appointment, however, was not continued, and arrangements have been made for the work to be carried out in 21 some degree by the various district nurses of the Ranyard Nursing Society. The lowest rates of Infantile Mortality amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs were 62 per 1,000 births in Hampstead, 68 in Chelsea, 70 in Lewisham, 72 in Stoke Newington, 73 in Woolwich, and 76 in Wandsworth; whilst the highest were 105 in Stepney and Southwark, 107 in Poplar, 111 in Bermondsey, 114 in Finsbury, and 123 in Shoreditch. Locally, the variations were from nil per 1,000 births in Kidbrooke, 65 in Charlton, 78 in East Greenwich, 81 in West Greenwich, and 160 in St. Nicholas; the following table compares at a glance these figures for the years since the formation of the Borough:— District.

All death causes are conveniently arranged under various headings, according to the Registrar-General's classification of diseases, and the following table, a summary of the larger table in the Appendix, shows the Death Rates for residents, and in fact all persons belonging to the Borough (although some of them may have died in Institutions in other Boroughs, or even outside the County of London altogether), per 1,000 of the population living in the Borough. 22 During last year the Registrar-General made certain alterations in his system of classification of deaths, in order to bring the same more into line with all other countries. These alterations are brought into effect in the Annual Report of the current year. 1912. 1912. Infective Diseases— Local Diseases—continued.

Infective Diseases. Epidemic. There were 121 deaths due to this class of diseases, equalling a Death Rate of 1.26 per 1,000; the rate last year was 2.58, and was 1.54 and 1.14 in 1910 and 1909 respectively. Zymotic. The purely Zymotic class of epidemic diseases is credited with causing a total of 116 deaths, equalling a Death Rate of 1.21 per 1,000. 23 The decrease of 1.26 in our Zymotic Death Rate is due entirely to the considerable decrease of deaths credited to Diarrhœa during the hot summer months. During the year 1911 the Death Rate from Diarrhœa was 1.66, whereas during last year it was 0.32, showing a decrease from this class of disease alone of 1.34, which is larger in itself than the difference between the two years' total Zymotic Death Rates. Locally, the Zymotic Death Rate varied from 0.35 in Kidbrooke (0.35 in 1911), 0.98 in Charlton (1.60 in 1911), 1.00 in East Greenwich (2.49 in 1911), 1.23 in West Greenwich (2.58 in 1911), up to 3.31 in St. Nicholas (4.82 in 1911). Small-Pox. There were no deaths from this disease in 1912, this being the tenth year since a death occurred from this cause in the Borough. Measles. Twenty-eight deaths were ascribed as due to this disease, all of the patients being under five years of age, compared with 40 which occurred in 1911; 47, 38 and 16 deaths were recorded in the three preceding years. Eleven of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 8 in West Greenwich, 4 in St. Nicholas, and 5 in Charlton. The quarterly incidence was 19 in the first, and 3, 2 and 4 respectively in the succeeding quarters. Scarlet Fever. This disease occasioned 9 deaths, 6 being under five years of age. Five of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich and four in Charlton. Three such deaths occurred in 1911 and three in 1910. Diphtheria. There were 16 deaths from this disease during 1912. This gives a Death Rate for Diphtheria of 0.17, comparing with 0.17, the rate for 1911. Sixteen deaths occurred in 1911, which were attributed to this cause, and 10, 7 and 18 in the three preceding years. Seven of the patients were under five years of age, 4 of them dying in the Brook Hospital, and 9 of the patients were over live 24 years of age, and of these 4 died in the Brook Hospital. There was a further number of 47 deaths from Diphtheria in patients not ordinarily resident in this Borough, but under treatment at the Brook Hospital. Thirty-five tubes of Diphtheria Anti-toxin, containing a total of 140,000 units of serum, for the treatment of patients suffering from this disease, have been supplied by this Council during the year. Whooping Cough. This disease was given as the cause of 30 deaths in 1912, as against 14, 56 and 20 in the three preceding years. These deaths equal a rate of 0.31 per 1,000. Ten of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich, 3 in West Greenwich, 12 in St. Nicholas, and 5 in Charlton. The Local Government Board have now sanctioned, for a period of five years from 1st June, 1912, of the addition of Whooping Cough to the list of diseases compulsorily notifiable in this Borough. Sections 55, 57, 66 and 68 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, being therefore now applied to this disease. Accordingly, during the latter half of the year, we have received 525 notifications of cases of this disease, each of which cases is therefore now visited, and as much isolation of the patient carried out as it is possible to obtain, and on the termination of the cases either by death or recovery, bedding, premises, etc., are disinfected in the usual way. The Metropolitan Asylums Board have also during the year admitted certain case-; of this disease to their Hospitals for treatment, which has proved an undoubted boon to many of the poorer class whose housing accommodation is considerably restricted. It is sincerely to be hoped that as these measures become more generally known throughout the Borough we shall hear less of cases of this disease being found in the Greenwich Park, which practice in the past has been the source of many complaints to this Department. Typhoid Fever. There were two deaths ascribed as due to this disease; there were 4 in 1911, 3 in 1910, 3 in 1909, 9 in 1908, [24 A. This Diagram gives in comparative form the Deaths from those Diseases which have caused the principal amount of Mortality during 1912. Red colour represents deaths from Infectious Diseases. Black ,, ,, other Diseases. 25 and 5 each in 1907 and 1906. One of the deaths occurred in East Greenwich and one in West Greenwich. Diarrhœa and Zymotic Enteritis. Thirty-one deaths were stated to be due to this cause, equalling a rate of 0.31 per 1,000. Last year there were 159 deaths, and 35, 34 and 49 respectively in the three preceding years. The deaths were distributed as follows:—Fourteen in East Greenwich, 8 in West Greenwich, 7 in St. Nicholas, and 2 in Charlton. Three patients were over five years of age. From a comparison of the above figures it will be noticed what a large drop there was in the number of deaths credited to this disease during this year compared with the preceding year. Undoubtedly the large proportion of this reduction is due to the different atmospheric conditions prevailing during the two years, for on comparing the figures for the various Boroughs throughout the whole of London one finds that a similar marked improvement has taken place. The average Death Rate for Diarrhœa and Enteritis in children under two years of age throughout the whole of London was 12.42, whilst for these two years of life the Greenwich rate was 10.46 per 1,000 births. Throughout the whole of London the figure varies between the wide range of 0.78 in Hampstead to 26.39 in Shoreditch: Greenwich standing in the 11th position. It will also doubtless be borne in mind that during (he summer months we had the services of a Temporary Female Health Visitor, whose duty it was to visit under the Notification of Births Act; this visitation was doubtless of some assistance in reducing the number of deaths, as it enabled the Inspector to give advice and practical help to mothers just at the time when such help was most needed and valued, that is, when the case of sickness was actually in the house. Many strange diets were noted during the course of this visitation, one of the most unsuitable for young children being what are locally known as "Toffee Apples," that is, small apples, most probably fallings, and, therefore, in an unripe condition, either partially cooked or not cooked at all, which are dipped in syrup and sold at many of the small 26 shops in the poorer parts of the Borough for three or four a penny. These are luxuries much appreciated by children, and the Health Visitor frequently found that the baby of only two or three months old had been regaled with the same luxury, after which one could not naturally expect much less than a severe attack of Diarrhœa or Convulsions. At the termination of this temporary appointment arrangements were made with the Ranyard Nurses' Society that their nurses should throughout the Borough carry out in some measure the visitation necessary under the Notification of Births Act. In this way the nurses are brought into contact with the parents at the very earliest possible moment, so that they can give useful advice regarding the upbringing of young children, and then when any children's illness occurs the nurse has already become a force to be reckoned with in the family life, thus her services at the actual time of illness become more valuable. Dysentery. There was one death from this class of disease in East Greenwich, the patient was attended at the Seamen's Hospital. Influenza. Influenza is found to have been the responsible cause for 12 deaths in 1912; 15 was the average of the previous three years. Of the 12, 3 were over sixty-five years of age. Sporadic Diseases. Tetanus. There was 1 death from this class of disease during the year. This occurred in the person of a carman who was attended in the Seamen's Hospital. Venereal. Syphilis. Nine deaths were given as due to Syphilis, as against 7 in 1911, 6 in 1910. Of these 9 deaths, 4 were children under five years of age. Four occurred in East Greenwich, 3 in West Greenwich, 1 in St. Nicholas and 1 in Charlton. Four of the deceased persons were in the Greenwich Infirmary. There were no deaths from Gonorrhœa during the year. Septic. Erysipelas. One death occurred from this cause in 1912, 5 in 1911, 3 in 1910, and 1 in 1909. 27 Puerperal Fever. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Pyæmia and Septicæmia. There were 2 deaths from this disease during the year. Infective Endocarditis. Two deaths were ascribed to this cause, in East Greenwich. The numbers were 2 in 1911, and 2 in 1910. Malarial. Rheumatic Fever. There were 6 deaths in 1912, as compared with none in 1911, 4 in 1910, and 4 in 1909. Rheumatism of the heart was the cause of 2 deaths. There were no deaths from Malarial Fever. Tuberculosis. This class includes the causes of 172 deaths during the year under review, with a rate of 1.80; these figures compare with 158, 136 and 146, the totals of the previous three years, and respective rates of 1.65, 1.21 and 1.32. Tuberculosis of the Lungs (Consumption) is, as usual, credited with the major portion of these deaths, there being 135 attributed to this cause, or a rate of 1.41 per 1,000, comparing with 1.35 per 1,000, the Phthisis Death Rate for the whole of London. Amongst the Metropolitan Boroughs this Death Rate ranged from 0.64 in Hampstead, 0.70 in Lewisham, 0.87 in Paddington and Stoke Newington, 0.93 in Wandsworth, up to 1.92 in Finsbury, 1.98 in the City of London, 2.07 in Holborn, and 2.10 in Shoreditch. Locally, the deaths were 1 in Kidbrooke, giving a Death Rate of 0 35; 13 in Charlton, giving a Death Rate of 0.75; 19 in St. Nicholas, giving a Death Rate of 2.62; 48 in West Greenwich, giving a Death Rate of 2.12; and 54 in East Greenwich, giving a Death Rate of 1.17 per 1,000. The remaining forms of Tuberculosis were responsible for 37 deaths, 18 being in East Greenwich, 10 in West Greenwich, 3 in St. Nicholas, 5 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Of these other forms of Tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of the Brain or its Membranes was credited with 21, 14 being under five 28 years of age; Tuberculosis of Larynx, 1; Tubercle affecting the Intestines, 4 deaths (2 being under five years of age); General Tuberculosis 7 deaths (4 under and 3 over five); and other forms, 4. Parasitic Diseases. There were no deaths from this class of Disease. Dietic Diseases. There were 4 deaths from this class of disease due to Chronic Alcoholism, 2 in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in Charlton. Constitutional Diseases. The deaths from this cause were 107 in number, which gives a rate of 1.12 per 1,000. Of these, 93 were attributed to Cancer, 6 to Anæmia, 5 to Diabetes, 2 to OsteoArthritis, and 1 to Purpura Hæmorrhagica. The deaths from Cancer were distributed as follows: 38 occurred in East Greenwich, 30 in West Greenwich, 5 in St. Nicholas, 19 in Charlton, and 1 in Kidbrooke. Developmental Diseases. There were 217 deaths from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 2.27 per 1,000. These may roughly be divided into those from causes which would appear to be unavoidable, viz.:—Congenital defects, 8, and those from causes more or less preventible, viz.:—Premature birth, 53; Injury at birth, 3; Debility at birth, 9; Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus, 23; Want of Breast Milk, 1; and Dentition, 2. The remaining and largest portion of these deaths from developmental diseases, 118 in number, were from Old Age; in 1911 there were 133 deaths from this cause, and 117 in the previous year. Local Diseases. Nervous System. Ninety-five deaths were attributed to the various nervous diseases, which gives a rate of 0.99 per 1,000; last year the rate was 1.28 per 1,000. Convulsions were responsible for 7, all being under five years of age; 1 was from Meningitis, 47 from Apoplexy, 1 from Softening of the Brain, 5 from Hemiplegia or Brain Paralysis, 8 from General Paralysis 29 of the Insane, 2 from other forms of Insanity, 2 from Cerebral Tumour, 6 from Epilepsy, 5 from Locomotor Ataxy, 5 from Paraplegia, and 6 from the other diseases of this system. Organs of Special Sense. There was 1 death from this class of causes, equal to a rate of 0.01 per 1,000. Circulatory System. The Death Rate from diseases of this system was 1.57 per 1,000, there being a total of 150 such deaths. Valvular diseases of the heart were responsible for 132, 9 from Aneurism, 5 from Embolism, 2 from Varicose Veins, and from the remaining diseases of this system, 4. Respiratory System. Two hundred and eighteen deaths were due to diseases of the respiratory organs, as compared with 200 in the preceding year. The Death Rate under this heading equals 2.28 per 1,000. Forty-seven were from Acute and 63 from Chronic Bronchitis; 94 from the various forms of Pneumonia, 36 being under five years of age, and 7 from Pleurisy, 2 to Emphysema, 1 to Laryngitis, and 4 to other diseases. Digestive System. There were 47 deaths from diseases of this system, equal to a rate of 0.49 per 1,000; Enteritis was responsible for 8, 6 being under five years of age; 4 were due to Ulcer of the Stomach and Duodenum, 7 to Appendicitis, 10 to Obstruction, and 2 to other diseases of the Intestines, 3 to Cirrhosis, and 2 to other diseases of the Liver, 3 to Peritonitis, 4 each to other diseases of Stomach, and other diseases of the Digestive System. Lymphatic System. There were no deaths from diseases affecting this system during the year. Urinary System. Forty-four deaths, equal to a rate of 0.46 per 1,000, occurred from diseases affecting this system. Thirty were from Bright's Disease, 3 from Acute Nephritis, 8 from diseases of the Bladder and Prostate, and 3 from other and illdefined diseases of the urinary system. Reproductive System. Diseases of the generative organs were the cause of 7 deaths. There were 4 deaths attributed to diseases of Parturition. 30 Bones and Joints. There were 2 deaths from diseases of bones and joints. Integumentary System. There were 5 deaths, 1 from Pemphigus, and 4 to other and ill-defined causes. External Causes. There were 47 deaths given as due to causes grouped under this heading; 42 were the result of accident or negligence, and the remaining 5 were from Suicide. Suffocation, by being overlaid in bed, was the cause of death of 1 child under five years of age; 7 cases were from drowning, while accidents on railways, in vehicular traffic and in building operations and falls, etc., were responsible for 34 deaths. The Suicides were by poison in 3 cases, 1 by cut or stab, and 1 from Drowning. There was also one death, cause of which was not ascertained, in East Greenwich. MORTUARY.

Two hundred and fifty-four cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, as compared with 313, 160, 155 and 221, respectively, in the four previous years. The distribution of these cases was as follows:—155 in East Greenwich, 57 in West Greenwich, 10 in St. Nicholas, 20 in Charlton, and 12 in Kidbrooke. Of this total number, 229 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Amongst which number the Hospital Authorities reported that in 14 cases they considered the diagnosis incorrect—4 of the cases being thought to be Tonsillitis, 2 Vincent's Angina, 1 Measles, 1 Tonsillar Abscess, and 6 not stated. There were 16 fatalities due to this disease, which gives a case mortality of 6.3 per cent. One thousand five hundred and ninety specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from cases suspected to be Diphtheria. Of this number, 1,350 were reported to give negative or doubtful results, and 240 were positive in character, being dealt with accordingly. The quarterly incidence of the disease for 1912 has been as follows:— lst Quarter—East Greenwich, 57 cases; West Greenwich, 7; St. Nicholas, 1; Charlton, 4; Kidbrooke, 5; a total of 74 cases. 2nd Quarter—East Greenwich, 30 cases; West Greenwich, 17; St. Nicholas, 3; Charlton, 1; Kidbrooke, 3; a total of 54 cases. 3rd Quarter—East Greenwich, 17 cases; West Greenwich, 14; St. Nicholas, 3; Charlton, 2; Kidbrooke, 2; a total of 38 cases. 4th Quarter—East Greenwich, 51 cases; West Greenwich, 19; St. Nicholas, 3; Charlton, 13; Kidbrooke, 2; a total of 88 cases. 36 Erysipelas. Ninety-five cases were notified during the year, 28 being in East Greenwich, 36 in West Greenwich, 24 in St. Nicholas, 4 in Charlton, and 3 in Kidbrooke. Twenty-four of these patients were removed to Public Institutions in the District. Scarlet Fever. Four hundred and thirty-five cases were notified during the year, as compared with 304, 170 and 390 cases respectively, in the three preceding years; 208 cases were in East Greenwich, 108 in West Greenwich, 23 in St. Nicholas, 81 in Charlton, and 15 in Kidbrooke; 379 of these cases were removed to the Hospital for treatment. There were 9 deaths from this disease during the year as against 3 last year. Seven of the cases removed to the Hospital as suffering from Scarlet Fever were returned as wrongly diagnosed, and 5 stated to be Tonsillitis and 1 Erythema; no alternative disease, however, being stated in the remaining case, while 10 patients on discharge were still suffering, 8 each from Chronic Rhinorrhœa, 1 each from Intermittent Otorrhœa and Chronic Otorrhœa, and parents were duly notified of this. The following Table gives particulars of the five cases which would seem to be "return cases." There were 7 such cases in 1911, 4 in 1910, and 10 in 1909. 37 Table shewing Return Cases of Scarlet Fever during Year 1912. No. of Case. Date of Removal of Primary Case. Date of Disinfection.

There were 11 cases of Typhoid Fever notified during the year, 5 being in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, 3 in St. Nicholas, and 2 in Charlton. The ages of the patients were: 1 between one and five years; 3 between five and fifteen years; 3 between fifteen and twenty-five years,and 4 between twenty-five and forty-five years. Of the total number of cases, 10 were removed to the Hospital for treatment. Ten such cases occurred in 1911, 19 in 1910, and 20 in 1909; the average number for the years 1901 to 1911, inclusive, being 39. There were two fatalities from this disease during the year, 1 in East Greenwich and 1 in West Greenwich. Fourteen specimens were forwarded for bacteriological examination from cases suspected to be Typhoid Fever in character, and of this number, 11 gave a negative result and 3 were positive. Puerperal Fever. Five cases of this disease were notified during the year, 3 in East Greenwich, 1 in West Greenwich, and 1 in Charlton. There were 8 cases in 1911, and 5 in 1910; 5 of these patients were removed to Hospital. There were 3 deaths from this disease during the year. Particular enquiries were made respecting the source of infection in each case, but in no way did there appear to be any common origin. During the year an order of the Local Government Board has been issued, authorising the Metropolitan Asylums Board Authorities to receive into their Hospitals, should they at the time have sufficient and suitable accommodation, persons suffering from Puerperal Fever, and, in case it becomes necessary to determine the priority in which persons shall be admitted to any Hospital, regard is to be had to each person's need and isolation in the interest of Public Health, as certified by the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority where the person is residing at the time when the question of her removal to Hospital arises. Measles. Five hundred and eighty-six cases of Measles were notified during the year, as compared with 840 during the previous 39 year, and 909, 795 and 497 in the years 1910, 1909 and 1908 respectively. The ages and incidence of fatality of the disease was as follows:—Of the total number, 17 were children under one year of age, amongst which cases there occurred 6 fatalities, equal to a case mortality of 35 per cent. There were 323 cases between one and five years of age, amongst whom there were 22 deaths, giving a case mortality of 6.8 per cent. Between the ages of five to fifteen years there were 245, with no deaths at this age period. There was 1 case at ages twenty-five to sixty-five with no death. The case mortality for the whole district works out at 4.8 per cent. 40 Table shewing number of Measles Cases reported during the year 1912. 1ST QUARTER. Under 1. 1 to 5. 5 to 15. 15 to 25. 25 to 65.

This Council made an order requiring the notification of cases of Zymotic Enteritis or Summer Diarrhœa during the months of June, July, August and September. The order was duly advertised and came into operation for the months stated. The sections included in the order were Sections 55 and 57 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and under the provisions of these sections 162 cases of Diarrhœa were notified throughout the whole of the Borough, 61 being under one year of age; 87 between one and five; 7 between five and fifteen; 5 between fifteen and twenty-five; 1 between fortyfive and sixty-five, and 1 over sixty-five. Eighty of such notifications related to patients in East Greenwich, 49 in West Greenwich, 18 in St. Nicholas, and 1 in Charlton, of which total number 5 were treated in Institutions in the district. As mentioned on the previous page in this report, a Female Health Visitor was appointed, one of whose duties being to visit cases of this disease. The favourable meteorological conditions had undoubtedly much to do with the satisfactory returns relating to this disease, for there were only 31 deaths ascribed thereto, comparing with 159 deaths last year. Whooping Cough. As indicated in the last Annual Report, the consent of the Local Government Board was desired to our proposal to make Whooping Cough a notifiable disease, this consent was given, for the period of five years from and including 1st June, 1912, Sections 55, 57, 66 and 68 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and applied to the disease, and, accordingly, under these provisions, 525 cases were notified, 84 being under one year of age, 280 from one to five; 15 from five to fifteen, and 1 between twenty-five and forty-five. The districts concerned being East Greenwich, 316; West Greenwich, 111; St. Nicholas, 54; Charlton, 33; and Kidbrooke, 11. Each of these cases were visited and leaflets and instructions left together with verbal advice respecting the isolation and care of the patient, and at the conclusion of the illness the usual disinfection was carried out. By this means it is hoped to educate the public as to the seriousness of the disease, and to endeavour to, as far as possible, prevent the spread 42 of the disease from one person to another by the promiscuous taking out and about of patients actually suffering from the disease, and undoubtedly we have had fewer complaints respecting undoubted cases of Whooping Cough being heard in Greenwich Park than during previous years. During the year the Metropolitan Asylums Board have also seen fit to extend their hospital accommodation to receiving certain cases of this disease. Leprosy. In the early part of the year a patient suffering from Leprosy in a severe form was found to be occupying premises which were entirely unsuitable for the patient; arrangements were accordingly made for the temporary housing of this patient at the Council's Isolation Shelter. He was eventually removed to the London Hospital, and has now gone to live in one of the more rural suburban districts. Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis or Cerebro-Spinal Fever. This disease is now permanently added to the list of notifiable infectious disease under Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and for notification purposes the disease at present known as Posterior Basal Meningitis is included in the term Cerebro-Spinal Fever; that term, however, is not to be interpreted to include cases of Meningitis due to Tuberculosis, Syphilis, middle ear disease or injury. Acute Polio-Myelitis or Acute Polio-Encephalitis. This disease is now permanently added to the list of notifiable infectious diseases during the year on an order of the London County Council approved by the Local Government Board, and 1 case was notified in St. Nicholas District and 1 case in East Greenwich. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. During the year whilst enquiring respecting certain cases of this disease which had been notified, several cases of Pemphigus in young children were brought to our notice, and, as a little crop of such cases appeared to be occurring in the practice of one Midwife, one of such cases proving fatal, the attention of the London County Council was drawn to the matter. The Midwife was interviewed by your Medical Officer of Health 43 and steps were taken to, as far as possible, deal with the situation, and the continuance of the cases came to an end. During the year 25 cases of this disease have been notified, 16 being in East Greenwich, 6 in West Greenwich, 2 in St. Nicholas, and 1 in Charlton, of which cases it has only been necessary that one should receive In-patient treatment at the Hospital. The others have been dealt with by the nurses at the patients' homes, or in some cases as Out-patients at the Miller Hospital. Isolation Shelter. As stated in another part of this report the Shelter was used during the year for the purpose of housing a Leprosy patient and his wife who waited upon him. In the latter part of the year arrangements were made with the London County Council that a portion of this Shelter should be set aside for the purpose of cleansing children who were stated to be in a dirty or verminous condition. A small "Reck" Disinfecting apparatus was purchased and installed on these premises, so that children's clothing might be properly disinfected whilst they were having the necessary bath and personal cleansing, and under this scheme, which came into force on 1st October, until the end of the year, 28 children were dealt with, receiving a total of 68 baths. Contacts. Intimation was received from the Medical Officer of Health of the various Fort Sanitary Authorities respecting 18 persons who had been in contact with Small-pox, Plague or Yellow Fever, as the case might be, and each person was kept under observation for the usual period. Glanders. Under the Glanders Order, notification has been made to this authority during the year with respect to one outbreak of Glanders. Enquiries have been made, and no human Glanders has appeared to result therefrom. Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia. No notification of any case of these diseases in man has been received during the year. Consumption. During the year there were 394 cases of Consumption notified in the Borough, 81 of these being under the 44 Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908, 127 under the Regulations of 1911, and 186 other cases, of which total number, 129 were in East Greenwich, 113 in West Greenwich, 97 in St. Nicholas, and 55 in Charlton, of which total number again, 28 from East Greenwich, 13 from West Greenwich, 16 from St. Nicholas, and 9 from Charlton were under treatment in an Institution. The ages of the patients were 7 under one; 14 from one to five; 72 from five to fifteen; 65 from fifteen to twenty-five; 143 from twenty-five to forty-five; 79 from forty-five to sixty-five; and 14 over sixty-five years. One hundred and twelve specimens were forwarded by Medical Practitioners for bacteriological investigation from patients suspected to be consumptive; 112 were reported to be negative and 22 positive. Disinfection has been offered and carried out in 97 cases, including 114 rooms and 391 articles of bedding, etc.; disinfectant has also been supplied to patients to disinfect sputum, etc., and sputum pots where such are found necessary. The coming of the National Insurance Act, 1911, with its various and far-reaching provisions relating to Tuberculosis, has' caused a considerable amount of attention to be devoted to that subject during the year. Conferences have been held of all the Metropolitan Boroughs, and again of such Councils and the London County Council, in the endeavour to define the sphere of action of the respective authorities when dealing with this question in London, and the general principle which has been adopted is that the London County Council should be the Central and co-ordinating authority, and should themselves be made responsible for the residential institutional treatment, whilst the various Metropolitan Borough Councils should be the responsible authorities for providing the local dispensary treatment. In connection with the latter Institution, I am pleased to relate that this Council are now negotiating for premises for the housing of such an Institution, which, it is to be hoped, that at no very distant time will be thoroughly equipped and in full working order. During the year 45 also authority was given for the purchase of two shelters for use in the back gardens of the patients in suitable cases. The following table shows the number and character of the notifications received under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908:— 1st Quarter. 1st Notification. 2nd Notification. 3rd Notification.

From which it will be seen that during the year there have been 81 patients notified, 28 of them being already in Poor Law Institutions, and 53 being patients outside such Institutions, concerning which patients we received 13 intimations of changes of address, a further 70 second notifications from other Poor Law Practitioners, 1 third notification, whilst 1 third notification of change of address was also received. School Clinic, or Health Centre, Deptford Green. This Institution, conducted under the able administration of Miss McMillan, continues to carry out its good work among the poor children in this neighbourhood, and an extension of the work has taken place in the provision of open-air shelter where selected boys can sleep. This camp was first established in the grounds of the St. Nicholas' Church, but has now been removed to private premises near by. The whole of the work in connection with this Institution is much appreciated in the neighbourhood. 46 HOUSES INSPECTED AND ENQUIRIES MADE IN CONNECTION WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Excluding Measles.

The Table on pages 63 to 67 summarizes, as far a; possible, the Sanitary work of the Department; from this it will be seen that a total of 13,755 houses and premises have been inspected or reinspected during the year: 1,280 intimation notices have been served, and 531 statutory notices. With the exception of prosecutions in connection with the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, it was only found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings in four cases, one being for the nondeposit of plans in connection with School premises, one being for not giving formal notice respecting carrying out of this work. These summonses were withdrawn by arrangement with the London County Council. Another summons was issued for not supplying particulars with respect to a house let in lodgings, this being also withdrawn as the information was supplied. The only remaining summons being for not carrying out certain sanitary works required under a notice, and, in this case, the Magistrate ordered the closure of the premises until the work was satisfactorily completed. There were altogether throughout the year 331 complaints entered in the Public Complaints Register of the Department; these were in each case carefully investigated, and any necessary action immediately taken; thus there are none of these matters left outstanding or unattended to. Bakehouses. One hundred and thirty-nine inspections have been made of the various Bakehouses in the Borough, and 55 nuisances found therein have been abated as the result. Factories and Workshops. Two hundred and twenty-five inspections have been paid to these premises within the Borough during the year. There were 278 workshop premises on the Register at the beginning of the year, 11 have been added during the year, and 8 have been taken off, leaving a total now on the Register of 281. This total includes 23 laundries, 48 dressmaking and mantle works, 8 fuel and firewood works, 5 cycle works, 9 milliners, and various others, including workplaces, such as 5 50 blacksmiths, 13 barge builders, 4 builders' yards, etc. Information has been sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories with respect to 1 new workshop, and also 6 instances where protected persons were employed on premises no abstract being displayed. One complaint has been received from H.M. Inspector, and also 11 intimations respecting alleged new workshops. Outworkers' Register. Seventy lists of Outworkers, containing 268 names and addresses, have been received during the year from the Medical Officers of Health for other Districts; 29 lists, containing 310 names, have been received from employers within the District; 44 lists, containing 151 names, have been forwarded to other Districts, thus giving a total of 427 names and addresses of outworkers within the Borough.

The slaughter houses in the Borough have been inspected on 65 occasions by the Inspectors. 54 Cowhouses. The four cowhouses in the Borough have been visited on 14 occasions, and the required cleansing has been duly enforced on 14 occasions. Horse Slaughterer. The one horse-slaughtering house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector on 31 occasions, and cleansing of the premises was required on 4 of these visits. Other Scheduled Offensive Trades. The premises where these offensive trades are carried on within the precincts of the Foreign Animals Wharf have been visited occasionally, but, as the supply of animals to that Wharf has been only of a very limited character, the work carried on also has been almost nil. Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order. At the commencement of the year there were 173 premises on the Register of Dairies and Milkshops; 9 new applications have been received during the year and added to the Register, and 16 names have been taken off, thus leaving a total of 166 premises now registered. During the year 206 visits of inspection have been paid to these premises; notices were served upon the occupiers in 24 cases, 7 of which were for dirty premises generally, in 3 cases for dirty milk vessels and utensils, 3 for proper coverings for milk receptacles, and in 11 instances for general insanitary conditions. Under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General) Powers Act, 1908, Section 5, with respect to the registration of premises unsuitable for the sale of milk, such registration has been refused on the grounds of the unsuitability of the premises in 7 cases. Ice Cream Premises. There were 118 premises known at the commencement of the year where the manufacture of this commodity was carried on, 13 have been added during the year and 6 taken off, leaving a total of 125 premises. These premises were inspected on 132 occasions, and improvements required either by way of cleansing of the premises in 9 cases and remedying of sanitary defects in 11 cases. 55 Food Preparation. Places where food is prepared have been visited on 248 occasions, improvements being required in 47 instances, as detailed below:— Class of Premises. Number on Lists.

Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. One application with respect to three tenements was received during the year for certificates under these Acts, but no certificate was granted for the alterations required were not carried out by the applicant. Housing of the Working Classes. Premises have been found to be overcrowded in 29 cases, which have all been abated, and in 2 cases the illegal use of underground rooms has been discontinued. Three hundred and twenty-four houses have been generally repaired; 374 premises have been cleansed, limewashed, and repaired: 222 have been improved as regards their ventilation; 349 premises have had the walls and ceilings cleansed throughout, and 247 premises have been partially cleansed: leaky house roofs and 56 gutters have been repaired in 450 cases: nuisances from dampness have been abated in 230 cases; dampness of walls have been remedied in 135 cases; direct connection between the internal sanitary fittings of houses and the drain have been disconnected, trapped and amended in 327 cases; similarly 86 stack pipes have been disconnected, trapped and amended ; 37 houses have been abolished as unfit for habitation : 2 have been closed through non-compliance with notices; and other nuisances, principally of dilapidations and want of underfloor ventilation have also been attended to in 84 cases. During the year 486 houses in this district have been inspected under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, the records of such properties being duly filed. Of this number, nuisances or defects were found in 424 cases, concerning which houses the necessary notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were served. Of these 424 houses thus dealt with, in 17 cases the landlord voluntarily elected to close the property instead of complying with the notices, and 9 of these 17 were demolished. In 338 cases the notices were satisfactorily complied with, leaving 69 cases still in hand or otherwise undisposed of at the end of the year. Housing and Town Planning Act.

Out of a number of such premises which have been reported to the Committee, it has been decided during 1912, to register 23, which, together with the 215 on the register at the end of 1911, gives a total of 238 premises on the Register of Houses let in Lodgings at the end of the year. Four hundred and sixteen visits of inspection were paid to these houses during the year, which brought to light the necessity of cleansing, etc., as set out below, as required by the By-laws, in 90 cases, whilst under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, cleansing, etc., was required in 56 cases, as set out below: — Number of notices served for cleansing of houses under the By-laws :— Rooms Cleansed 56 Staircases and Passages Cleansed 26 Water Closets Cleansed 4 Overcrowding 3 Insufficient Ventilation 1 90 Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891: — Cleansing 5 Without Ash Bin 16 Water Closets Blocked and Water Fittings Defective 19 Water Closets Dirty 3 Sink Waste Defective and Blocked 6 Floors Defective 3 Insufficient Ventilation 1 Defective Guttering, etc. 2 Yard Paving Defective 1 56 Number of Inspections of Registered Houses 416 Number of Notices Served 85 Re Particulars of Registration 27 Re Registration . 16 128 58 House Drainage. Two hundred and fifty-eight house drainage systems have been reconstructed; 228 such systems have also been opened, cleansed and amended; 21 new systems and 216 surface drains have been constructed: 186 drains and soil pipes have been ventilated, 286 systems have been tested by smoke and 350 by water, of which number 271 were found to be defective; 57 new soil pipes and 320 traps have been fixed, together with 74 intercepting chambers and 20 other chambers. Five cesspools have been abolished; 53 areas, 145 yards, and 1 mews and stable have been thoroughly drained. Thirty-two water-closets have been erected; a pan, trap and water supply have been furnished throughout in 202 cases, and other fittings in 263 cases, whilst the water supply has been renewed in 131 instances. The water supply for lavatory purposes has been disconnected from the drinking water system in 42 instances. Public-house urinals have been cleansed and repaired in 58 instances, whilst a water supply has been laid on or repaired at 8 such conveniences, and 1 urinal was altered. Complaints were again received to the effect that houses on the low-lying land between Woolwich Road and the River in the Charlton District and certain premises facing on the Woolwich Road became flooded with sewage. The attention of the London County Council was drawn to this fact, and they allege that the flooding was due to a very heavy rainfall, which they stated was quite of an abnormal degree, and, although this may have been the cause of the unfortunate flooding with sewage, yet it is not much consolation or satisfaction to the owners or occupiers of the premises affected, necessitating, as it does, the taking up of floors in order to clear away filthy debris remaining after flooding. Refuse Removal. New ash receptacles have been provided in 375 cases, and 11 complaints on this sub ject have been forwarded to the Surveyor for his attention. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangements entered into with Messrs. Hempleman & Co., of West Ham, still continue to work very satisfactorily. 59 Public Sanitary Conveniences. The Public Sanitary Conveniences, Urinals, Fountains and Horse Troughs situated within the Borough are the same as last year. Water Supply. The water supplied throughout the whole of the district by the Metropolitan Water Board still maintains its high standard of purity. During the year 51 water supply certificates have been granted under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; these certificates stating that the new houses to which they refer are supplied with a proper water supply in accordance with the Act. Defective water fittings have been renewed in 182 cases; 23 water supplies have been reinstated where the supply had been cut off; water fittings have been amended in 189 cases; 44 water supplies have been altered so as to draw direct from the main; the cleansing, repairing and covering of cisterns has been required in 19 cases. Smoke Nuisances. One hundred and ninety-four observations have been taken for smoke nuisances during the year, but on only 4 occasions was it found necessary to issue Statutory Notices for the abatement of any nuisance which was found. Food and Drugs Act. Four hundred and twenty-two samples have been purchased under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which 404 were certified to be genuine and 18 adulterated, the adulterations thus being equivalent to 4 per cent, of the samples taken. Of the total number of samples purchased, 101 were butter, of which 2 were adulterated: 144 were milk, of which 8 were certified to be adulterated: the remaining adulterated samples were 2 of dripping, 2 of separated milk, and 1 each of bitter ale, mild ale, old ale, and porter. All the samples of milk were also examined for preservatives, but nothing of this character was found after the date of the coming into force of the regulations dealing with the matter. There was 60 one sample which contained the equivalent of 35 grains of boracic acid to the gallon, but this was taken on May 31st, namely, the day before the coming into operation of the Regulations, and, accordingly, no proceedings were taken, a warning letter being sent to the Vendor. Samples taken since from the same source have proved satisfactory. Proceedings were taken in 17 of these cases, and in the other case a warning letter was sent. These proceedings resulted in fines and costs being imposed in 13 cases; in one case a warranty was proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and in 3 other cases the summons had to be withdrawn as the bottles containing the third portion of the samples had burst. Proceedings were also taken for selling milk without being registered, which resulted in a fine of 5s. with 2s. costs. During the year my attention was drawn to an undoubted case of lead poisoning and two or three illnesses of a similar suspicious character. On investigating as to the source of this limited outbreak the only thing in common appeared to be that all the patients were supplied with beer from one beer shop in the neighbourhood. The patient who was most severely affected was also in the habit of having practically the first drink from these premises in the morning. Samples of the various beers sold from the premises were taken first thing in the morning and were found to contain appreciable quantities of lead. One prosecution was instituted and a fine imposed; the proprietors have also since altered their system of piping and no further complaint has arisen. Unfortunately the patient who was the most severely affected died as a result of the illness. 61 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.— Number and Description of Samples purchased for Analysis under the above Acts during the Year 1912.

It is a matter for satisfaction that, apart from the proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, only four other summonses were needed. One being for not supplying particulars as to a house let in lodgings. The summons was, however, withdrawn, as the information was supplied immediately after the summons was served. One for insanitary conditions, a closing order being made by the Magistrate with 3s. costs. And one being for contravention of the By-laws relating to the non-deposit of plans, in not giving notice of intention to carry out sanitary alterations, and one for carrying out work contrary to the By-laws, which was again, after several adjournments, withdrawn by arrangement.
