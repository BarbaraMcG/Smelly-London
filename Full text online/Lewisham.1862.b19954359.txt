The mortality of the district is considerably below the average for the last seven years, and the general health of the public may be considered good. No deaths have occurred from epidemic disease. Four deaths have occurred from pulmonary consumption, and three from inflammation of the lungs. A few cases of whooping cough have occurred in the district of a mild character; and cases of this disease, and of scarlet fever, have occurred in the North Surrey District School. The water, obtained from wells, supplied to the Almshouses of the "Fellowship" porters, upon Westow Hill, Upper Norwood, Penge, is of bad quality, and has in one instance been the cause of serious illness to one of the inhabitants. It is important to have a supply afforded from a purer source. The drainage of some houses situated at the back of the " Rock and Fountain" inn, Sydenham, requires immediate attention. The open ditch at the back of the " Dolphin" inn, and other houses situated in Lower Sydenham, is in a most offensive state, and requires covering. The roads in Chaplin Street and Hindsley's Place, Forest Hill, are in a dangerous and offensive state, and require attention. The ventilation shafts in the sewer at Dartmouth Park still give out a most oppressive odour, which is observable for a long distance. I should suggest that charcoal boxes be fixed under the gratings to remedy this nuisance. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. 11 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

The births of 52 boys and 34 girls (total 86), and the deaths of 23 males and 18 females (total 41), have been registered. Two deaths only have taken place from zymotic disease, viz.— 26th April. Diptheria, Central Sydenham. 17th May. Influenza, West Kent Park. There are several nuisances injurious to the health of parts of the district, some of which I have before brought under your notice, and which I now again annex, with others, for your consideration. Lewisham. In Hither Green Lane offensive sewage flows into the ditches, and has been a nuisance to the inhabitants there for many months. Penge. The boundary ditch, by the side of the North Surrey School ground, still contains offensive sewage, which it is most important to remove into the sewer. The Board of Management request your interference in this matter. At 34, Ancrly Vale, the pump water is offensive and unfit for use, from sewage contamination ; and there is no proper closet supplied to the house. It is important that a proper supply of water should be immediately afforded. (Landlord, Mr. Latter, Brixton Hill). Open privies upon the large brickfield adjacent to Royal Naval Asylum. Sydenham. The houses known as Yerey's Cottages, situated at the back of the "Bird in Hand" public-house, are dilapidated; and are wet and unhealthy from want of repairs to water-troughs, &c. At Orchard Place, Perry Hill, there is no water supply, the stinking brook adjacent 12 Being quite dry. It is most important that some means should be taken to supply this unhealthy part of the district with water. At Laurel Brook, near Orchard Place, a ditch contains offensive sewage from ??? house, which is the property of the parish, and which might readily be drained into the sewer. At Raglan Street, Nos. 10 and 13, the Poor Law Medical Officer informs me that they are never without illness. The drains are said to be broken under the floor, and the waste pipe from the cistern is not trapped. An offensive ditch containing sewage exists between the Rev. Mr. Hind's and Camden Villa, Sydenham Hill. Offensive sewage still runs along the ditches from Shaw's Cottages, by Meadow Croft, into the ditch on the other side of the road at Bell Green. A small barrel or pipe drain would be sufficient to obviate this nuisance, which has been often complained of by the neighbouring inhabitants with great reason.

The average death rate for the same period for the last seven years is slightly above 31 ; therefore, taking into account the increase of population, the mortality has been considerably below the average. Two deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, viz.— 2nd June. Female, 16 years, typhoid fever, King William Asylum, Penge. 17th ,, Female, 3 months, diarrhoea, Mid Kent Cottages, Lewisham. Five deaths have taken place from pulmonary consumption, and four from inflammatory affections of the chest. The health of the district has continued to be in a favourable state, and has been remarkably free from epidemic diseases. Penge— At No. 5, Anerly Yale, a drain has given way, and the contents are flowing under an adjoining house, occupied by Mr. Paddy. There is illness in the house, and therefore 13 this should be remedied immediately. The system of drainage of all these houses is unsatisfactory. The boundary ditch of the North Surrey School still receives sewage. Sydenham— The drainage flowing from Laurie Park, through Messrs. Smith's, Beale's, Dawson's, &c., property, is still very offensive. The offensive smell from the open sower at the back of the "Dolphin" inn is extremely prejudicial to the health of the neighbouring inhabitants; and a valuable house in Lower Sydenham remains untenanted in consequence of its proximity to this dangerous nuisance. Lewisham— In consequence of complaints received from Mr. Brown, St. Mary's house, Woodlands, of illness in his house from insufficient drainage, I have examined the house, which I find to be offensive and prejudicial to health, from a water.closet placed upon the bedroom landing, without any ventilation other than into the house itself, and with no water supply. This should be attended to at once. The drainage here is into cesspools, which should be more frequently cleansed and deodorized. Meteorological tables and tables of mortalitv are appended as usual.

Seven deaths have taken place from consumption; two deaths from inflammation of the lungs. Fourteen deaths have been registered among children under two years of ago, and 12 in those above 60 years. Diarrhoea is slightly prevalent in the district, and a few sporadic cases of measles have occurred, but this disease is not prevalent. The yard used by a butcher and poulterer at Blackheath, and adjoining the premises of Mr. Wray, stationer, have recently been in an offensive state, from accumulation of decomposing animal and vegetable matter; and although this has been removed in the course of tho last two or three days, it is importont to prevent its recurrence, as it is prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants of the adjoining premises. Such refuse should be daily removed. Some plan requires to be thought of for the drainage and water supply of Orchard Place, Perry Yale, which is one of the most unhealthy portions of the district.

Four deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— Scarlct fever, Wells Road, Sydenham. Measles, Bell Green, Sydenham. Diptheria, Carlton Villas, Sydenham. Fever, Upper Sydenham. Measles have been very prevalent in the district during the past few weeks. A case of typhoid fever, depending upon the offensive state of the house, has occurred 15 at Bell Green, in a house occupied by Mr. Palmer, grocer, &c. The sewage from the adjoining houses, belonging to Mr. Sugden, empties into a cesspool, which, I am informed, occasionally overflows into the cellars and basements of the adjoining houses. In this instance it found its way into the cellar of Mr. Palmer, from which it had to be baled; and no doubt has caused the disease from which he is suffering. A number of pigs, and accumulations of manure and refuse, exist at the backs of houses in the High Street, Sydenham, which require your order for the removal. A heap of cinders and offensive decomposing animal and vegetable refuse lies exposed in a garden at Park End, and is a source of annoyance to the neighbouring inhabitants. This lias been several times complained of. As cinder heaps contain a quantity of vegetable matter and refuse of various descriptions from dwelling-houses, it is important that they should be enclosed in covered receptacles, in which the presence of the carbonaceous matter of the cinders in a dry state tends to retard decomposition ; but when exposed to moisture and air, these heaps decompose rapidly, and become an offensive nuisance and one dangerous to health.

The amount of mortality is in excess of that registered last year, but considerably below the average calculated for the corresponding month during the last seven years.

Scarlet fever has been rather prevalent, and a few cases of measles have occurred. 16 Diarrhoea has been less prevalent than usual during the autumnal season, but four deaths arc registered from this cause. The drainago of a portion of the Canal Road, Forest Hill, requires to be entered into the main sewer. At present it runs by the side of the road in an offensive manner. Fever has been prevalent in parts of the Wells Road, Sydenham, for some time. In Windsor Terrace, Wells Road, several cases have occurred; and at the last house nearly the whole family have suffered from it. These houses are drained into a cesspool, without ventilation to remove the sewer gases. In Bath Place, Wells Road, cases have also occurred; also cases of scarlet fever. In Nelson Terrace, Wells Road, the second house is in an offensive state. The Inspector has personally visited and inspected the several cow-houses and slaughter-houses in the district, which ho reports to be in good order, with one or two exceptions. Mr. Samuel, cow-keeper, Blackheath Hill, occupies a cow-house which is in a most dirty and dilapidated condition, but which contained no cows upon my visit of inspection. The slaughter-house at the back of Mr. Walters's, butchcr, in Blackheath village, is clear, but refuse matter, consisting of a mixture of stablo manure and refuse substances from butchers', fishmongers', and poulterers' shops occasionally give forth a most intolerable stench. This accumulation should not be allowed to exist, or should be daily removed from the locality. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

I wish again to call your attention to the fact that the deaths from these epidemic diseases arc quite out of proportion to the deaths from all causes in this very healthy district; that these diseases are known to take their origin from local poison, arising from want of efficient drainage and water supply; and by referring to the list of localities and which these deaths occur, it may be observed that almost all of them have been from ?ime to time reported to you as suffering from some deficiency either as to drainage, of water supply, or both. Cases of measles have been somewhat prevalent in the district, as above enumerated. Three children have died from this cause in one family, residing in Railway Cottages, Forest Hill Cases of fever have occurred in Bath Place, Wells Road, and in Church Grove, Lewisham, &c. Two cases of smallpox (one in a child not vaccinated) have occurred in Hanover Street, Lewisham. The state of the reads in Hanover Street, Lewisham, are likely to be productive of disease. They arc in a wet and filthy state; and the water in a part of this locality runs into the houses. Church Terrace, Lewisham, is still undrained; and from the thickness of the population in this locality, and from a case of fever being reported there, it is most important to have this attended to at once. The road here is also wet and undrained. At Hindsley's Terrace, Sydenham, what should be a road is a muddy undrained swamp, and most unwholesome to the neighbourhood. Chaplin Street, which is nearly as bad, I have before brought under your notice. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Sixty-five deaths have been registered during the above space of time—a number which would not be much above the average estimated for the increase of the population of the district, but still a larger mortality than we have before witnessed during the same space of time. The average mortality of the district for the December month would be 40. 19 Thirteen deaths have taken place from epidemic disease in the undermentioned localities:— 28th November. Measles, King Street Lewisham. 6th December. Ditto Loampit Vale „ 11th „ Ditto Hanover Street „ 30th November. Typhoid fever, Stanstead Lane Sydenham. 7th December.

In Wells Road, Sydenham, in one family, three children and one adult have died from scarlet fever, and the remaining members of the family have barely escaped. It appears that in this district mortality attributed to epidemic disease seldom takes place but in those localities which are remarkable for their want of drainage and attention to sanitary measures; and this circumstance is no exception to this rule—a fact to which I have before called your attention. The whole of the Wells Road is unhealthy from its want of sewer accommodation, &c. Scarlatina and measles are prevalent in the district.

During that period 85 children have been born, and the deaths of 64 persons have been registered. The mortality still continues to be greater than usual. Epidemic disease has been prevalent, and thirteen deaths have been registered as occurring from this class of disease, viz.— In Blackheath— Male, 18 days. Diarrhoea, King Street.

Cases of smallpox have occurred in Russell Street and Willow Road, Sydenham; apparently taking their origin from a case of that disease imported from Poplar. Cases of scarlatina and measles have occurred during the month, but this epidemic is abating. I have to direct your attention to two houses situate in Lewisham, in the occupation of Mr. Henry Heath and Mr. Smith, which are quite out of repair, and which still have old offensive closets and no water supply. This was reported upon some months back. Also to the dreadful state of Springfield, Wells Road; Hindsley's Place, Chaplin Street. During the month two fatal accidents have occurred: one at the Anerly Station of the London and Brighton Railway, and another upon the Chatham and Dover Railway, now in course of construction through Penge.

This year the deaths of 41 persons are recorded. Fifteen deaths have been registered for the hamlet of Penge—an unusually large number for that ward. Eight deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, five of which occurred in Penge, one in Blackheath, and two in Sydenham, viz.— In Penge— Male, 5 months. Diarrhoea, Penge. Male, 2 years.

In Sydenham— Female, 7 months. Hooping cough, Chaplin Street. Male, 2 years. Measles, Hanover Street. A newly born infant was found dead in the Canal at Anerly Bridge, decomposed and mutilated. A gentleman was killed by being thrown from his horse at Anerly Vale. A coachman dropped dead from the box of a private carriage at the Crystal Palace entrance. Epidemic diseases are still prevalent in the neighbourhood—measles, hooping cough, and scarlatina—and a few sporadic cases of smallpox, which may be all traced to infection. The greater prevalence of this disease during the past few months indicates the great importance of vaccination, and that of re-vaccination when years have elapsed since the first vaccination. The yard occupied by Messrs. Hopkins and Kember, at Bath Place, Blackheath, is occasionally offensive from an accumulation of manure. It is most important that, as the summer approaches, no accumulation of this kind should be allowed. In Paxton Park, Lower Sydenham, fifty houses are drained into cesspools which overflow into the gardens and road. The new sewer runs at the end of the road, and it is of importance that a branch should be laid from the main to drain this now populous locality. In Anerly Grove, Penge, the drains are burst and overflowing, to the danger of the health of this thickly populated neighbourhood; and No.'s 1 to 10 have no dustbins. Complaints have been received several times respecting a cow-yard at the back of the " Rock and Fountain," Sydenham. It is at times in a most offensive state, and requires both paving and draining. The state of Springfield, Wells Road, Sydenham, also urgently requires attention. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERYATIONS.
