HARRO 3 1895. HARROW-ON-THE-HILL Urban District Council. ANNUAL REPORT OF JOHN FLETCHER LITTLE, M.B. Cantab, M.R.C.P. Lond., Medical Officer of Health for Harrow. Harrow: Printed by F. W. Provost, High Street. 18 9 6 HARROW-ON-THE-HILL URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Area, 2,197 Statute Acres. Estimated Population, 1895, 7,807. Population (Census 1891), 5,725; Area, 1,000 Statute Acres. ANNUAL REPORT, 1895. 32, Harley Street, Cavendish Square, W., February 16th, 1896. To the Chairman of the Harrow Urban District Council. Sir, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1895. The estimated population to the middle of the year 1895 is 7,807. As the Greenhill addition has only been a portion of the District for one quarter of the year, I have only taken its population at one-fourth the estimated number. During the year there were registered 73 deaths and 169 births. This gives a death-rate of 9 3 per 1,000, and a birth-rate of 21.6 per 1,000. The age distribution of deaths is as follows: Under 1 year 18 Over 1 year and under 5 10 under 5 years 28 „ 5 years „ 151 „ 15 „ „ 25 2 „ 65 17 over 5 years 45 73 2 Of deaths under the age of 1 year there were 106 to 1,000 births, or at the rate of 1 to 9. Zymotic diseases caused 1 death, or at the rate of .13 per 1,000. Typhoid Fever 1 death, Puerperal Fever 1 death, Diarrhoea 3 deaths, Phthisis 5 deaths. During the year there were certified 10 cases of Scarlet Fever, 1 case of Diphtheria, 3 cases of Typhoid Fever, 1 case of Puerperal Fever, and 7 cases of Erysipelas. The low death-rate and the small mortality from Zymotic disease are causes for satisfaction, and indicate an improved sanitary condition of the district. THE ISOLATION HOSPITAL. The wisdom of the late Board, under the chairmanship of Dr. Stiven, in providing this Hospital, has been amply justified by the results. Cases of infectious disease are now promptly isolated, and outbreaks that might have developed into epidemics have been speedily suppressed. So long, however, as London remains inadequately supplied with means for isolating its infectious cases, Harrow, like all other places in the Home Counties, will remain in constant danger of invasion. Should this state of things be allowed to continue, it may be necessary that joint representations should be made to the Government by the Local Authorities of the districts affected with a view to its speedy amelioration. The generous provision which the Council has made for the treatment and comfort of the patients, and the devotion with which the head nurse and her helpers have performed their difficult and trying duties, have made the Hospital popular with the inhabitants of the town. The fact that no death has occurred in the institution is highly satisfactory. DAIRIES AND DAIRY FARMS. There has been a steady improvement in the condition of these places during the year, and in the cases where the requirements of the Council are fulfilled they will be licensed. A considerable portion of the milk supply of the town comes from outside the district, and it is necessary to guard against danger from this source. 3 BAKERIES. The bakers of Harrow have shown a commendable desire to meet the demands of modern sanitary science, and they have cheerfully carried out many suggestions I have made with this object. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The great importance of preventing diseased meat being sold for food renders it incumbent on me to urge upon the Council the necessity of providing a public Slaughter House. Were this done all the meat could be properly inspected, and any found unfit for food condemned. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. One of the two Common Lodging Houses in the town has been inspected and recommended for a license. The occupier of the other claims that as the whole premises are licensed as an Inn, he is under no legal obligation to register the portion used as a Common Lodging House. I have drawn the attention of the Council to the fact that when I was last permitted to visit the premises the sanitary conditions were not good. SEWAGE AND SEWAGE FARMS. All the sewage of the district is distributed over the surface of the Sewage Farms, and this comes in contact with the growing crops. It is therefore necessary that all houses which drain into the sewers should be under the control of the Council, so that no infected excreta is allowed to pass into them. NOTIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION. It should be generally known that the law requires all householders to notify to the Medical Officer of Health all cases of Notifiable Infectious Disease occurring on their premises. The certification by the medical attendant does not relieve the householder of this duty. 4 SANITARY LITERATURE. There is a great lack of knowledge in certain sections of the public as to how to prevent the spread of Infectious Diseases. A supply of pamphlets giving this much-needed information has been provided by the Council, and can be obtained free of cost on application at the office. NEW HOUSES. There were 81 new dwelling houses, 25 additions to dwelling houses, and 16 new buildings (not dwelling houses) erected during the year. METEOROLOGICAL REPORTS. These reports are appended, and have been carefully kept under the supervision of Mr. Charles, the Sanitary Inspector. The rainfall for the year was 25.21 inches. This is less than that of last year, which was 29.48 inches. The improved sanitary condition of Harrow is largely due to the efficient manner in which Mr. Charles has performed his duties as Sanitary Inspector. I feel greatly indebted to him for the willing aid he has always rendered me, and for the great promptitude with which he has isolated cases of Infectious Disease. I remain, Sir, Your obedient servant, JOHN FLETCHER LITTLE, M.B. Cantab., M.R.C.P. Lond., Medical Officer of Health for Harrow.
