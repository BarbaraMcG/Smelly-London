AC 4355 STPAN 29 SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH ON THE Sanitary Condition of St. Pancras, middlesex. REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1872, BY THOMAS STEVENSON M.D., Lond., FELLOW AND EXAMINEE OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF LONDON, LECTURER ON CHEMISTRY AT GUY'S HOSPITAL, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. St. Pancras, Middlesex. SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the medical officer of health, Being the Report for the Year 1872. TO THE VESTRYMEN OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, In the year 1872, 7,913 births were registered in the Parish of St. Pancras; or, more correctly 7,891 births during the fifty-two weeks ending on the 28th December, 1872. The number of births of males largely exceeded those of females; the ratio being 4,073 males to 3,818 females; or 107 boys to 100 girls. During the fifty-two weeks the births exceeded those of the fifty-two weeks of 1871 by 353. Correction must be made, however, for children born of pauper non-parishioners in the Strand Union Workhouse. Deducting the children born in that institution the births were 7,830 during the fifty-two weeks, or 7,852 for the year of 365 days. Assuming the average population during the year to have been 224,000, the birth-rate was 35.1 per 1,000 persons living. In 1871 the birth-rate was 33.8 per 1,000. 4,930 deaths were registered during the fifty-two weeks, and 4,928 during the year of 365 days. From this number, 4,928, must be deducted 104 deaths in the Strand Union Workhouse, and 64 deaths in Highgate Infirmary of non-parishioners; and there must be added 7 deaths in Homerton Fever Hospital. The corrected number of deaths is thus reduced to 4,767. These numbers compare very favourably with those registered in 1871, when the actual mortality of parishioners was 5,598. Concisely stated, the deaths in 1872 were 831 less than in 1871; 2 and the annual rates of mortality were respectively 21.28 and 25.19 per 1,000 persons living. In 1872 the death-rate was 21.28 per 1,000. „ 1871 „ 25.19 „ „ 1870 „ 24.15 „ „ 1869 „ 22.81 „ „ 1868 „ 22.50 „ „ 1867 „ 24.25 „ „ 1866 „ 24.45 „ „ 1865 „ 24.80 „ „ 1864 „ 26.03 „ „ 1863 „ 23.28 „ „ 1862 „ 21.80 „ „ 1861 „ 23.00 „ It will be observed that the mortality in 1872 was the lowest of the last dozen years. This is remarkable, seeing that it followed on the very high mortality of 1871, when the death-rate was higher than during any one of the last dozen years, excepting 1864. In the metropolis, as a whole, the annual rate of mortality in the year under review was 21.40 per 1,000; and in the north district, of which St. Pancras is a part, it was 22.9 per 1,000. The death-rate in this parish was hence 0.12 per 1,000 below the metropolitan average, and 1.6 per 1,000 below that of the North Registration District. MORTALITY AT VARIOUS SEASONS. The following table will be found useful, as showing when a diminished rate of mortality began to be felt:— Annual Rate of Mortality. First Quarter (January to March) 24.17 Second ,, (April to June) 22.53 Third ,, (July to September) 22.09 Fourth ,, (October to December) 19.14 The progressive diminution in the rate of mortality is thus strikingly manifested. MORTALITY IN THE SEVERAL SUB-DISTRICTS AND IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. In every Sub-district there was a lower death-rate than during 1871; the diminution being greatest in the southern part of the parish. Also there were fewer deaths in 1872 than in 1871 in every one of the registered public institutions within the parish, viz.:— Highgate Infirmary, St. Pancras Workhouse, Strand Union Workhouse, University College Hospital, and the Royal Free Hospital. 8 MORTALITY AT VARIOUS AGES. For the fifty-two weeks the deaths were— In 1872. In 1971. Under 1 years of age 1,291 1,295 0—5 „ 1,986 2,154 5—6 „ 1,851 2,093 Above 60 ,, 1,093 1,183 exclusive of deaths of parishioners in extra Parochial Institutions, which were far more numerous in 1871 than in 1872. The deaths of children under one year of age formed 16'4 per cent, of the registered births. MORTALITY FROM VARIOUS DISEASES. The annual rates of mortality from the undermentioned diseases in the year 1872, were as follows:— London. 1872. St. Pancras. 1872. St. Pancras. 1871. Small Pox 0.53 0.26 3.42 Diarrhoea and Cholera 1.19 1.05 1.06 Continued Fevers 0.40 0.35 0.50 Scarlet Fevers 0.27 0.31 0.43 Diphtheria 0.08 0.07 0.17 Hooping Cough 0.98 1.16 0.71 Measles 0.51 0.47 0.47 Phthisis, Tabes, Atrophy Scrofulous Diseases 3.43 4.38 4.48 Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Asthma 3.57 3.56 4.06 These deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases, viz., Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Hooping Cough, the Continued Fevers, and Bowel Fluxes, formed 16.7 per cent. of the total mortality, as compared with 26.l per cent. in the year 1871. In the metropolis, as a whole, the corresponding per centage for 1872 was 17'9 per 1,000. We are now in a position to state how the lessened mortality of 1872 came about. If to the actual rate of mortality during this year we add the diminished rates of mortality from zymotic diseases, tubercular diseases, and inflammatory affections of the lungs, as compared with 1871, figures are obtained (24.89) which approximate closely to those which express the annual rate of mortality during the year 1871. Hence the favourable death-rate of 1872 was due,— firstly, to the little prevalence of zymotic diseases; and, secondly, to the small fatality from tubercular diseases and inflammatory lung affections. Tested by every method, the vital statistics of 1872 for St. Pancras show the good effects of sanitary improvements and precautionary sanitary measures: there was a lowered death-rate among persons of all ages from infectious diseases, from diarrhœal complaints, from phthisis, and from children under five years of age from all causes. 4 St. Pancras Parish (and indeed London generally) exhibited a more favourable rate of mortality than the following large towns: Liverpool, Edinburgh, Manchester, Salford, Glasgow, Dublin, Hull, Birmingham, Leeds, Bristol, Portsmouth, Norwich, "Wolverhampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Bradford, Oldham, Sheffield, Newcastle-onTyne, and Sunderland. The year 1872 was characterised in this parish by the little prevalence of epidemic disease. Small Pox was almost non-existent among us. Scarlet Fever had comparatively few victims, and the same may be said of Diphtheria. Measles and Hooping Cough were rather more prevalent—the latter constituting our chief zymotic disease. Typhus and Enteric (Typhoid) Fevers were less prevalent than usual, and relapsing fever was entirely absent. Summer and autumn diarrhoea also killed fewer victims than usual. The Disinfecting Chamber continues to do good service and is an invaluable adjunct, not only during greater but also during minor prevalence of epidemic diseases. METEOROLOGY. The Meteorology of the year 1872 was so peculiar, and, no doubt, influenced to so considerable an extent the mortality of the year, that it is worthy of a detailed notice. January was a wet and tempestuous month, the rainfall being about three times as great as the average of this month. There were no severe frosts. During February the temperature was, as a rule, above the average of the month. Though the number of rainy days was not great, the depth of rainfall was excessive. In March, about three weeks of variable weather was succeeded by a week of bitterly cold weather. The end of the month was tempestuous and warm. The rainfall was a little above the average. April was characterised by great alternations in temperature, excessive rainfall, and electrical disturbances. May was cold, ungenial, and stormy. Vegetation was retarded and destroyed in many parts of England by frigid polar winds, snow, sleet, and thunder storms. The rainfall was excessive. June was a variable and stormy month. It is not often that (as in this month) England is visited by a storm accompanied by sleet in June. The rainfall was large. The Meteorology of July has been aptly described as "one grand prolonged series of demonstrations of the powers of elemental electricity." Sultry days, humid winds, and thunder storms characterised this month. Again the rainfall was excessive. In August the temperature was unusually low, thunder storms prevailed, and the rainfall was large. 5 Disastrous thunder storms also characterised September, and excessive fluctuations of temperature. October was a rough and squally month, with about twice the average rainfall. November was a boisterous, rainy, stormy month; but fogs were very little prevalent. December was a fearfully tempestuous month, with a rainfall that was simply prodigious. The year 1872 was hence characterised by an enormous rainfall, innumerable thunder storms, much wind, and great alternations of temperature and meteorological conditions generally. VACCINATION. I am indebted to Mr. Tom Adams for the interesting table relative to Vaccination. It exhibits in a clear form the state of the parish with regard to Vaccination, more expecially of infants, and embraces returns not only of public, but also of private Vaccination, showing how satisfactorily the new Vaccination arrangements are working, as far as regards the amount of Vaccination done. I have made repeated visits to the Vaccination stations, and have always met with a goodly number of well Vaccinated children, each child having seldom less than four good vesicles. There is no doubt, too, that the new arrangements for public Vaccinations ensure at all times an abundant supply of good lymph for arm to arm Vaccination, so that it is rarely necessary to Vaccinate from lymph preserved in sealed tubes or on points. SANITARY LEGISLATION OF 1872. The chief Sanitary Act of the Session of Parliament of 1872, was the "Public Health Act, 1872." The Act affects the metropolis by only one of its provisions, and in this manner. The 20th section constitutes bodies, termed port sanitary authorities, to whom are assigned the powers, rights, duties, capacities, liabilities, and obligations under the Sanitary Acts; and, further, the corporation of the City of London is made to be the port sanitary authority for the port of London. It may be expected that this clause of the Act will prove of great value in preventing the introduction of contagious and infectious disease, and especially cholera, into this metropolis and into this parish. It is too little borne in mind how closely this parish is connected with the port of London by the Regent's Canal; and how we are thus exposed, by vessels coming up the canal, to the invasion of epidemic disease. An Act (35 & 36 Vict. cap. 61) was passed to prevent the nuisance 6 and annoyance arising from the use of steam whistles and steam trumpets, and requiring the sanction of the Vestry to the use of such instruments. A few applications were made under the Act and were referred to the Sanitary Committee, who, deeming some of the whistles a nuisance, were averse to the granting of such sanction. The Vestry, however, overruled the decision of the Committee, and granted its sanction in every case to the use of the whistles. Another Act, though nominally placed under the administration of the Metropolitan Board of Works, has, in consequence of the acknowledged incapacity of the Board to carry out its provisions, been referred to the Sanitary Officers by the Vestry. I refer to "The Infant Life Protection Act, 1872;" a well iutentioned, but, as I believe, totally inefficient Act for the prevention of unlicensed babyfarming. The most important Sanitary Act of the Session, is the Act to Amend the Law for the Prevention of Adulteration of Food, of Drink, and of Drugs. The Act of 1S60 for preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food or Drink—the provisions of which had been extended with great stringency to drugs by the Pharmacy Act, 1868, was found to be quite inoperative. It is hoped and expected that the new Act will not likewise prove a failure. As the law now stands:— 1. It is quasi-imperative on every local authority (whose jurisdiction collectively extends over the whole kingdom) to appoint a competent analyst, and inspectors to procure samples for analysis. You have done your Sanitary Officers the honour of electing them your officers under the Adulteration Acts. 2. Adulteration of two kinds is made illegal; firstly, the admixture of an eatable or drinkable with a substance injurious to health or poisonous ; secondly, the fraudulent admixture of an article of food or drink in order to increase its weight or bulk. It would appear that the admixture must be wilful. In one respect, at least, the definitions of adulteration are defective: the facing of inferior articles (as e.g. tea) with substances not injurious to health, with the view of giving a false appearance to an inferior article, does not appear to be an adulteration. Nor does the Act forbid this most unwarrantable procedure—the admixture of good article (say cocoa) with many time its bulk of comparatively worthless matter (as e.g. potatoe-starch), and enclosure of the whole in a gorgeous wrapper, bearing in all cases utterly valueless certificates of some analyst as to the quality of some sample other than the one actually sold; provided that any words, however misleading, be placed on the wrapper stating the article is not the unmixed article; and I need hardly say, that the vendor always avers that the article has been improved by the manipulation practised. 3. All admixtures of drugs are deemed adulterations; and 7 rightly so, for any tampering with drugs, on the due administration of which life itself may depend, is a heinous offence. Pharmaceutical chemists, moreover, are bound to know the quality of the articles in which they deal, and have, in the British Pharmacopæia, an authoritative standard of purity and quality laid down for the most important drugs and chemicals, accompanied by directions for testing as to purity and quality. These gentlemen are therefore placed in a different category from the ordinary trader. 4. The mixer as well as the vendor of an adulterated article is liable to punishment. Though the Act is crudely drawn and bears the marks of the haste in which it passed through parliament, its intentions are admirable— to protect the public health against injurious adulteration; and to protect the public against frauds on their pockets. I trust that the great care and discretion which the Vestry and its Committees have taken iu putting the Act in force, so as duly to enforce it without hardship to the trading community will produce excellent results. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. In my last annual report, I drew attention to a Bill introduced into the Session of Parliament of 1872, for the perpetuation of private Slaughter-houses. I regret that the Bill, thrown out last Session has been re-introduced in the present Session. The question has also been taken up by the Butcher's Trade Society, which has issued a placard urging the public to petition in favour of the Bill. In this document great stress is laid upon the high price of meat, which, it is alleged, would be raised by the abolition of private Slaughter-houses; whilst the Sanitary aspects of the question are (perhaps on account of the difficulty of meeting them) ignored,— except that it is stated the public Abattoirs would be gigantic nuisances. I regret that the Society should be so apparently illinformed as to some of the facts of the case. I must assert my conviction that many of the small ill-constructed Slaughter-houses in this parish, are sources of great annoyance to a neighbourhood and cause serious nuisances. There are 87 slaughterhouses in this parish, and it is impossible for two general Sanitary Inspectors to do more than make periodical visits to them. It would require one inspector's whole time to give them the amount of attention which they require. Vested interests have alone prevented many of these places being abolished; and the year 1874 has been looked forward to as the time at which they would legally cease to exist. One of the great evils connected with private Slaughter-houses is the facilities they afford for the slaughter of diseased animals, as no efficient inspection can be made of the animals before they are slaughtered. Diseased animals cannot well be slaughtered in public Abattoirs without detection. 8 In opposition to the statements of the Butcher's Trade Society, the following facts are well-known:— In Edinburgh, which, since the year 1851, has had no private Slaughter-houses, and only one public Abattoir, it is stated on excellent authority, that the system is found to be very advantageous to trade, and a great boon to both butchers and consumers. The poor are benefited by the abolition of a nuisance, the sale of less unsound food, and the cheapening of the meat supply in consequence of all butchers competing on an equal footing. In Cardiff the system has worked well, and a large source of profit arising from the sale of the flesh of diseased animals has been abolished. In Glasgow, where three public Slaughter-houses were established in 1850 and private Slaughter-houses abolished, no inconvenience resulted or has since resulted; the price of meat was not affected by the change; less of unsound food is now sold; and the result has been satisfactory to both butchers and consumers. In Paris the abolition of private Slaughter-houses did not enhance the price of meat; whilst in Berlin the price of meat has been lessened by a similar change of system. It appears to be assumed that the passing of the Bill in question would leave matters as they are now; but this is, I believe, a mistake. At present the Statute of 1844 prevents the opening of new Slaughterhouses, except where these are situated at a distance of at least 40 feet from a public way, and 50 feet from a dwelling-house ; and in addition the Magistrate's license is required. Were the Statute of 1844 repealed, as the Bill proposes, nothing but the Magistrate's license would be required, and there would be nothing to prevent Slaughter-houses springing up everywhere in close proximity to dwellings. I would remind the Vestry that odd views are sometimes entertained as to the kind of place fitted for the slaughter of animals for food. The Sanitary Committee has been asked more than once during the last three years to sanction the use of cellars, beneath dwelling-houses in crowded localities, as Slaughter-houses; and one enterprising individual seemed surprised that a photographer's hut, with access only through a dwelling in close preximity, and up a set of wooden steps, was not deemed suitable for the purpose. Since the above was written the Bill has been withdrawn and referred to a Select Committee. COW-HOUSES. At the October Petty Sessions, held at the Vestry Hall in October last year, 82 applications for licenses to keep cows were made. Of these 10 were refused— 5 owing to infringements of previous licenses. 9 2 as being for unfit places. 2 being opposed by inhabitants. 1 being dirty when visited by Justices. Five were granted for a less number of cows than before, owing to infringements; and in two cases licenses for increased numbers were given. SANITARY WORKS. Tables are appended, as usual, kindly furnished, the one by Mr. Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Department of Works; the other by Mr. Leach, Clerk in the Sanitary Department, assisted by the Sanitary Inspectors, giving details as to the amount of Sewer work done, nuisances abated, unsound food seized, &c., during the past year. I desire to acknowledge the cordial manner in which the officers in the Sanitary Department have assisted me in carrying out my duties during the year under notice. GAS. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied by the Imperial Company, as tested by Letheby's photometer, according to the requirements of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, was 14.4 standard sperm candles. The highest illuminating power observed was 16.4 candles, and the lowest 12.6 candles. The average illuminating power was a trifle less than during the preceding year, and the fluctuations were greater; the maximum illuminating power observed being greater, and the minimum less in 1872 than in 1871. Sulphur in various forms fluctuated from 18.4 to 39.9 grains per 100 cubic feet; the average amount present having been 24.5 grams. During the previous year (1871) the amount was less and the fluctuations not so great. Ammonia was invariably present though never in excessive quantities. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never detected in the Gas supplied at the testing station, 10, Edward Street. On the whole, the Gas supplied in 1872 was not quite so good as during 1871; but the inferiority was only slight. It is to be feared that with the continued high price of coals, but little improvement in the quality of the Gas can be expected. THOS. STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.
