The number of marriages registered during the year was 606, as compared with 742 during the previous year. There were 519 in Churches of England, and 87 in Chapels and Roman Catholic Churches. 606 The following table shows the number of marriages and the rate per 1,000 in the Borough of Deptford and London during the past ten years:— B 2 3 year. deptford. .Marriage Rate for London, per 1,000.

The number of deaths registered in Deptford during the year was 1,251, equal to a death-rate of 10.6. From this number 156 has to be deducted, being deaths of non-parishioners which occurred in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's South-Eastern Hospital, and 548 deaths of parishioners which occurred in public institutions outside the Borough added, making a total of 1,643, and upon this number the statistics are based. The death-rate for the Borough was equal to an annual rate of 13.9 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 14.0 for 1907, 16.0 for 1906, and 14.3 for 1905 per 1,000 persons living, with an average of 15.7 for the past 10 years. The death-rate in England and Wales was 14.7 (the lowest on record), in the 76 great towns 15.8, in the 142 smaller towns 14.7, and in the County of London as a whole 13.8. Deptford compares most favourably with the other Metropolitan Boroughs with regard to the death-rate. For while Hampstead, which was 8.5, and was the lowest as one would naturally expect, Bermondsey was the highest with a death-rate of 18.8. Deptford being 14th on the list of the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs. The following table gives the number of deaths which occurred in each Ward, and the death-rate in each Ward (See also Table 6):— 4 Ward. Deaths. Death Rate per 1,000. Males. Females. Total.

The following diseases are classified by the Registrar-General under this heading:—Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, “Fever” (Typhus, Enteric and Continued), Diarrhoea, Plague. The zymotic diseases caused 164 deaths as compared with 154, 318 and 233 for the three preceding years.

The number of notifications received during the year, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 1,131, as compared with 1,248, 1,171, and 991 for the three preceding years. Table No. 3 shows the total number received during the year, the number of cases in each district, also the number removed to hospital from each district. SMALL POX. I am glad to say there was no case of this disease notified during the year. SCARLET FEVER. The 741 notifications received during the year related to 723 cases, of these 22 were errors of diagnosis and cases which occurred in hospital, thus reducing the net number of cases to 701. The number of cases during three past years was 741, 674 and 603. The deaths were 6, compared with 13, 16 and 9 in the three preceding years. The death-rate was 0.05, and for the three preceding years 0.11, 0.13, 0.07.

The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3:—North Deptford 192, South Deptford 218, Central Deptford 313. DIPHTHERIA AND MEMBRANEOUS CROUP. There were 206 notifications received relating to 197 cases. Of these 18 were hospital cases, and errors of diagnosis, reducing the number of cases to 179, against 262, 290, and 143 for the three preceding years. The deaths registered were 10, and for the three preceding years 26, 18, and 9.

The highest rates from diphtheria were recorded in Fulham, Hackney, Bethnal Green, Stepney, Poplar, Bermondsey, and Lewisham. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of specimens of membrane sent to them, 53 of which were found to be positive and 106 negative, total 159. ENTERIC FEVER. There were 29 cases notified, of these 3 were returned as errors of diagnosis, leaving 26 cases against 26 last year: 19 of the cases were removed to hospital. It was not possible to trace the source of the infection in any of the cases. The deaths were 6, in the preceding three years 5, 6, and 6 respectively. The death-rate was equal to an annual rate of 0.05, and for the preceding three years, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.05. Although one regrets to find 6 deaths in the Borough of Deptford from this disease, still the greatest proportional mortality was recorded in Chelsea, Stoke Newington, Holborn, Finsbury, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, and Bermondsey. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.07, in the 76 great provincial towns 0.08, in the 142 smaller provincial towns 0.08, and in London as a whole 0.05. The cases were distributed as shown in Table No. 3—North Deptford 8, South Deptford 8, Central Deptford 13. Bacteriological examinations were made by the Clinical Research Association of 14 specimens of blood sent to them, 6 of which were found to be positive and 8 negative. ERYSIPELAS. There were 168 notifications of Erysipelas received during the year as compared with 130, 161, and 154 for the three preceding years. PUERPERAL FEVER.

Notification of Cerebro-spinal Fever was made compulsory in the Administrative County of London on March 12th, 1907, for a period of six months. This order was further extended (August 27th) for a term of eighteen months from September 13th, 1907. Notices of this order were posted in the Town Hall and other public places in the borough. The number of cases notified in the County of London during the year was 85, whilst in the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford there were none. DIARRHŒA. The total number of deaths registered from the above disease was 82, against 20, 146, and 84 for the three preceding years. Of these 82 deaths, 79 were children under five years of age, 75 of these being under one year of age. Diarrhœa showed the greatest proportioned fatality in Finsbury, Shoreditch, Bethnel Green, Stepney, Poplar, Southwark, and Bermondsey. The death-rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 0.69. The death-rate for the past eight years in Deptford and London are shown in the following table:— Year. Deptford. London. 1900 0.72 0.84 1901 0.94 0.86 1902 0.35 0.53 1903 0.64 0.64 1904 1.02 1.02 1905 0.73 0.72 1906 1.26 0.94 1907 0.18 0.32 Average for 0.73 0.73 years 1900-1907 0.73 0.73 1908 0.69 0.53 The rate of mortality for England and Wales was 0.50, for the 76 great towns 0.65, for the 142 smaller towns 0.52, and for London as a whole 0.53. 9 In North Deptford there were 28 deaths, in South Deptford there were 11, and in Central Deptford 43. MEASLES. The number of cases of Measles dealt with during the year was 850, as compared with 726, 1,007 and 600 for the three preceding years. As the disease is not notifiable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the above figure does not represent the total number of cases which have occurred in the Borough, as our only source of information as to the existence of cases is from the Head Teachers of the London County Schools. The same procedure is adopted in the case of measles, with regard to disinfection, as if it was notifiable. There was a decline in the number of deaths registered, which were only 33, as compared with 55, 71, and 16 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality was equal to 0.28 per 1,000 persons living, compared with 0.47, 0.61, and 0.13 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.22, in the 76 great towns 0.31, in the 142 smaller towns 0.20, and in the the Metropolis as a whole 0.31. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was the cause of 25 deaths, compared with 35, 61, and 18 for three preceding years. The death-rate per 1,000 persons living was equal to 0.21 as compared with 0.30, 0.52, and 0.15 for the three preceding years. The rate of mortality in England and Wales was 0.27, in the 76 great towns 0.29, and in the 142 smaller towns 0.25, and in the County of London 0.20. Of the 25 deaths from this cause, 7 were children under one year of age, and 18 were children over one year and under five years. North Deptford had 14 deaths, South Deptford 2, and Central Deptford 9. TUBERCULOSIS. Tuberculosis (or Consumption) is an infectious disease caused by the Tubercle Bacillus. It is not only a preventable disease, but it can also be arrested, especially in its earlier stage. The symptoms are aggravated by malnutrition, lack of fresh air, and want of cleanliness, especially amongst the poor. C 10 As was mentioned in my Annual Report for 1907, in a great many cases of Tuberculosis, especially in children, it can be traced as a result of the introduction into the human body, of the bacillus bovine tuberculosis, the bacillus being introduced through the cow's milk. This, as is well-known, can be avoided by boiling the milk. The Local Government Board has issued an order which will come into force on January 1st, 1909, rendering the compulsory notification of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis by the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution, and by the District Medical Officer in the case of any poor person he is attending, according to his agreement with the Board of Guardians. The notifications are to be made to the Medical Officer of Health within forty-eight hours after the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are first recognised. The Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution is required to post to the Medical Officer of Health a notification of the actual or intended place of destination of any person leaving the institution with respect of whom notification has been made, and the same obligation is laid upon the Relieving Officer in the case of persons not in an institution who may change their address. The Order is not to authorise anyone to put into force any enactment which renders the person notified or any other person liable to a penalty or subjects him to any restriction, prohibition or disability affecting him or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood, or residence, on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of deaths registered during the year was 153, equal to an annual rate of 1.30 per 1,000 persons living, that for London as a whole was 1.32. The rate of mortality in the borough for the three preceding years was 1.56, 1.69 and 1.58 respectively. There were 58 deaths registered in North Deptford, 30 in South Deptford, 65 in Central Deptford. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. Under this heading are included Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Pleurisy and other diseases of the respiratory organs. The number of deaths registered during the year was 336, compared with 373, 329, and 329 for the three previous years. 72 were children under one year of age, 60 children over one and under five years and 104 were persons over 65 vears of age.

The arrangement for the bacteriological examination and report upon doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, was renewed by the Council with the Clinical Research Association of Watergate House, Adelphi, W.C. The number of examinations made by them during the year ending 2nd January, 1909, was 173; 159 of them being for Diphtheria and 14 for Enteric Fever, the result being that 59 were found to be positive and 114 negative:— Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria 53 106 159 Enteric 6 8 14 — — — 59 114 173 At a cost ot £3J, 10s. 5d. DISINFECTION. In consequence of the action taken by the Boiler Insurance Company with regard to the old disinfecting apparatus at Knott Street, it became necessary to put the new disinfecting station in Watson Street in use, which was accordingly done on 12th February, 1908. The new station consists of an infected room 13 ft. by 17 ft., and a disinfected room 30 ft. 6 in. by 17 ft., two van sheds, a store room, bathroom, and w.c. The old machine and boiler after having been repaired was brought to Watson Street, so that now there are two machines and two boilers for use, both Washington-Lyons. They are so connected that either boiler can supply steam to either machine. The vacuum apparatus has been so connected as to make it available for the old machine as well as the new one. The recording gauge has also been connected up in a similar manner. For such infected articles which would be injured by steam— leather goods, furs, boots, books, &c., are disinfected by formic aldehyde, volotised in an alformant-lamp in a specially constructed zinc-lined chamber. There are two vans employed, one used for collecting infected articles, and the other for returning them after disinfection is completed. With very few exceptions, all disinfection is carried out by the staff of the Council, and no charge is made. The number of rooms disinfected by the Council's staff during the year was 1,532. The number of articles of bedding, clothing, &cc., disinfected at the Council's yard being 11,618. Disinfecting fluid is supplied gratis where required. 13 Disinfection of wearing apparel, &c., under the Midwives Act, was carried out in four cases. Two hundred and seventy books belonging to the Council’s Public Library, collected from houses where infectious diseases had occurred, were disinfected before being put back into circulation. Seven premises consisting of eight rooms were fumigated during the year, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, as being verminous. Four sets of horse clothing were disinfected after glanders. THE SHELTER. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 60, SubSection 4, imposes on the Sanitary Authority the duty of making provision for the temporary housing of persons who are compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority. The accommodation provided at the new premises in Watson Street consists of a detached building containing two separate and distinct tenements, each consisting of two bedrooms, kitchen, larder, bathroom, and w.c. The two bathrooms can be used for the cleansing of Verminous Persons. Up to the end of the year there had been no occasion to use the shelter. MORTUARY AND CORONER’S COURT. I am pleased to be able to report that the Mortuary and Coroner’s Court were completed during the year. We have now the Coroner's Court, Mortuary, Disinfecting Station, and Isolation Shelter all on one site, which is a great convenience. The Mortuary and Coroner’s Court were formally opened on June 24th, 1908, by Councillor Walter Falkner, the Chairman of the Public Health Committee. The Mortuary consists of a Mortuary Chamber, 25-ft. by 20-ft., containing six Catacombs, Viewing Table, &c. The Post-mortem Room, which measures 23-ft. by 16-ft. 9-in., contains two tables, one fixed and one revolving, a sink, and Lavatory basin fitted with hot and cold water, all by John Jones, Ltd., of Chelsea. Adjoining this is the Surgeon’s Room, and Surgeon’s Lavatory and w.c. In the front of the building is a Waiting Room, 12-ft. by 10-ft., for the use of mourners. Separating this from the Mortuary, is a corridor from which the jurymen view the body, through a fixed window looking into the Mortuary Chamber, a screen being placed round the body so that nothing else is visible. The Infectious Mortuary is quite separate and distinct, and is a chamber 17-ft. by 14-ft. 14 By a singular coincidence the Mortuary was first used and the first post-mortem examination was made by myself on July 1st, 1908. The Coroner's Court, which stands by itself, consists of the Court which is 30-ft. by 21 -ft., with fittings in oak by Messrs. G. M. Hammer & Co., Ltd., a Witnesses' Room, 16-ft. 4-in. by 11-ft. 4-in., and a private room for the Coroner, 14-ft. by 14-ft., with a lavatory and w.c. adjoining. Separate sanitary conveniences are also provided for men and women respectively. There are five rooms above, the apartments of the Mortuary Keeper, who is also Caretaker of the whole premises. During the year 67 bodies were received into the Mortuary. Register of Bodies Received into the Mortuary During the year ending January 2nd, 1909. Total. Males. Females. Post Mortems. Inquests.

In 1890 Parliament passed the Customs and Inland Revenue Act (33 Vict., Cap. 8), in which (Section 26, 2) they granted exemption from inhabited house duty for houses used solely for providing separate dwellings at rents not exceeding 7s. 6d. a week for each dwelling, provided that a certificate is produced from the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situated, to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, with due provision for their sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health must examine such premises on request, for the purpose of ascertaining whether such certificate can properly be given. In 1891 Parliament extended the benefits of the Act, and in 1903 the provisions were again extended and embodied in a new Section (Revenue Act, 1903 (Section 11), the previous enactments being repealed except with regard to the mode of obtaining the certificate. The exact words of the Section are:— II. (i.) Where a house, so far as it is used as a dwelling house is used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings:— (a) The value of any dwelling in the house which is of an annual value below twenty pounds shall be excluded from the annual value of the house for the purposes of inhabited house duty; and (b) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual value of twenty pounds, but not exceeding forty pounds, shall be reduced to three pence; and (c) The rate of inhabited house duty, in respect of any dwelling in the house of an annual rate exceeding forty pounds, but not exceeding sixty pounds, shall be reduced to sixpence. The applications made undsr this Act during the year were in respect to 4 houses in Trundley's Road relating to 8 tenements; as suitable sanitary accommodation was provided, the certificates were granted. COMMON LODGING HOUSE ACTS, i85i & 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of Common Lodging-houses. The following is a list of Common Lodging-houses registered in this district, providing accommodation for 437 persons; in addition to which there is Carrington House, Brookmill Road, which provides for 802 lodgers.

The total number of premises inspected was 3,463, whilst re-inspections, calls, services of notices, etc., amounted to 11,245. The number of preliminary notices or "intimations" served during the year was 1,573, whilst the number of "statutory notices" served was 60, and in only one case was it necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce these orders. Overcrowding was abated in 25 cases without having to take legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year 92 observations were made, and in 16 cases where black smoke was emitted in such a quantity as to be a nuisance, notices were served to abate the nuisance. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, made by the Council pursuant to Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (e) For the cleansing and lime-washing at stated times of the premises. (f) For the taking of precautions in case of infectious disease. The number on the register is 269, the whole of which were regularly inspected with a view to seeing that they comply with the byelaws as regards cleanliness, overcrowding, etc. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. These premises were periodically inspected during the year. The number of inspections were 282, involving 106 premises and 226 rooms. The premises include hotel kitchens, restaurants, coffeeshops and eating-houses of various kinds, fried-fish shops, eel-pie shops, oyster bars, ham, beef and pork shops, sausage-making and meat-chopping premises, and any place where food is cooked or prepared for sale to the public, or intended for human consumption. 20 The number of premises added to the register during the year was 6, the removals therefrom numbering 13, leaving a total of 106 at the end of the year. Sixteen notices were served for various defects, and these, together with the usual notices for periodical cleansing, were readily complied with. During the year, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, came into operation, which includes the following provisions in relation to these premises:— Section 8 (l).—From and after the passing of this Act the following provisions shall apply to any room, shop, or other part of building within the County in which any article, whether solid or liquid, intended or adapted for the food of man is sold, or exposed for sale or deposited for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, or with a view of future sale. (a) No urinal, water closet, earth closet, privy or ashpit or other like sanitary convenience shall be within such room, shop, or other part of a building, or shall communicate therewith except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (b) No cistern for supplying water to such room, shop, or other part of a building shall be in direct communication with and directly discharge into any such sanitary convenience. (c) No drain or pipe for carrying off fœcal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room, shop, or other part of a building. (d) No room, shop, or other part of a building shall be used as a sleeping place, and so far as may be reasonably necessary to prevent risk of the infection or contamination of any such article as aforesaid no sleeping place shall adjoin such room, shop, or other part of a building and communicate therewith except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (e) Refuse or filth whether solid or liquid shall not be deposited or allowed to accumulate in any such room, shop, or part of a building except so far as may be reasonably necessary for the proper carrying on of trade or business. (f) Due cleanliness shall be observed with regard to such room, shop, or other part of a building, and all articles, apparatus and utensils therein, and shall be observed by persons engaged in such room, shop, or part of a building. If any person occupies or lets, or knowingly suffers to be occupied any such room, shop, or other part of a building, wherein any of the conditions prohibited by this section exist, or does or knowingly permits any act or thing therein in contravention of this section he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not 21 exceeding for a first offence twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence five pounds, and in either case to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings. It will be observed that these new regulations apply not only to premises where food is undergoing a process of preparation for sale, but also to shops, etc., where food is exposed for sale, or deposited for purposes of sale after preparation in some other premises. BAKEHOUSES. The number of premises on the register is 78, 75 of which are registered as " workshops" and 3 as "factories." Underground premises number the same as the previous year, viz., 28. Cleaning and limewashing. The half-yearly limewashing has been regularly carried out, and cleansing done from time to time when found necessary, and any sanitary defects were remedied without the necessity of serving any "official" notices, except in 5 cases, when they were readily complied with. The number of inspections made during the year was 327. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES AND OUTWORKERS. Constant attention has been paid to these premises during the year, special attention given to sanitary accommodation and cleanliness of same, and also to the repair of defective apparatus, fittings, etc. Great improvement has been effected in the condition of sanitary conveniences for the use of persons employed. The old practice of mixed accommodation, i.e. the use of the same conveniences for male and female workers, has now been entirely eradicated in this Borough and ample separate accommodation is now in use. The usual reception and despatch of Outworker returns has been continued during the year, and the registers kept up to date. FACTORIES. The number of factories on the register at the close of the year (including laundries and bakehouses) was 98, involving 228 rooms. Thiriy-eight have been added to the register during the year, and 4 removed. On the register there are at present 9 factory laundries and 3 factory bakehouses; and other factories number 86. The number of inspections were 113, and notices served 7. 22 WORKSHOPS. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was (including Workshop Laundries, Workshop Bakehouses and Domestic Workshops) 258, with 380 rooms. Number of Inspections:—Workshop Laundries 10, Bakehouse workshops 317, other workshops (including domestic workshops) 184, notices served 14. WORKPLACES. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was (including Food premises) 161, with 296 rooms. The number of Inspections made was 296, notices served 16. These premises include stables where persons are employed, Restaurant Kitchens, Builders' Yards, etc., etc. OUTWORKERS. The number of Outworkers on the register at the close of the year was 463 with 468 rooms in use. The number of inspections was 383, notices served 3. Lists received from employers 90, giving 594 persons employed. Number received from other Authorities was 463, and forwarded to other Authorities, 343. In six instances work was found in connection with infected premises and the necessary disinfection carried out before removal of the materials on hand. This system of work is still in a very fluctuating condition, persons frequently giving up the work on account of the very poor remuneration: and a continual alteration of the register results, not only from this cause, but also the very frequent removal of the person taking in the work. As found necessary, cleansing and repairs were carried out. No legal proceedings were necessary during the year. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND PURVEYORS OF MILK. Special attention has been paid to these premises during the year. 627 Inspections have been made, and 11 notices served. The number on the register at the close of 1907 was 203, 56 were added during the year and 59 removed, leaving 200 remaining on the register. Cleansing and limewashing was carried out wherever such was found to be necessary, and the use of defective or corroded cans and other vessels was prohibited where they were found. Seventyseven cans and other receptacles were dealt with in this way during the year. It being rather doubtful as to whether this comes within 23 the definition of contamination under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, no legal proceedings were taken. In the Annual Report of last year I directed attention to the proposed action by the London County Council with regard to dealing with the sale of milk in unsuitable and undesirable premises. I then remarked, owing to the very mixed nature of the trade carried on in the small general shops registered for the sale of milk, very strict supervision was necessary to keep them in a cleanly condition and in accordance with the orders. It is very desirable that shops should be prohibited from selling milk where articles such as fish, paraffin oil, coal, &c., are sold, which, though they may not be considered strictly a contamination are yet very undesirable articles in connection with the sale of milk, and registration should be limited to such premises as dairies only, or confectionery and butter and provision businesses. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Part II., Sec. V. Sub-Sec. (l), increased powers have now been given to Sanitary Authorities to deal with this matter, as follows:— (l) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1885, or in any subsequent order, any Sanitary Authority may remove from the register kept by them of the persons from time to time carrying on in their district the trade of Cowkeepers, Dairymen, or Purveyors of Milk, or may refuse to enter upon such register the name of any person carrying on or proposing to carry on the trade of a Dairyman or Purveyor of Milk upon premises which are in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. Provided that for the purposes of this Section premises shall not be deemed to be unsuitable on any ground inconsistent with the provisions or requirements of any order or regulation made under any enactment for the time being in force and applicable to such premises. (2) Any person who thinks himself aggrieved by any decision of a Sanitary Authority under the provisions of this Section may at any time within twenty-one days from the date of such decision, appeal against the same to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and if on any such appeal it shall appear to the Court that the premises of the person appealing are in all respects suitable for the sale of milk therein, the Court may make an order, requiring such Authority to enter upon or restore in the register the name of such person. During the year the London County Council under Section 31 of the General Powers Act of 1907, issued the following circular, and 24 a copy of the same was served by my Inspector on each of the Cowkeepers, Dairymen, and Purveyors of Milk within the Borough:— COUNTY OF LONDON. Milk Supply (Tuberculosis). The London County Council, pursuant to Section 31 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, hereby gives notice of the provisions of Part IV. of the said Act relating to the supply of milk in the County of London. The effect of these provisions is as follows:— Power to take samples of milk and inspect cows. The Council's Medical Officer of Health or other duly authorised person may take, within and outside the County, samples of milk produced or sold or intended for sale within the County; and if the Council so resolve the officers of a sanitary authority may as regards their district also take samples of milk for examination by the Council subject to such conditions as the Council mav prescribe. The Medical Officer or other duly authorised person may in company with a veterinary surgeon enter any dairy within or outside the County from which milk is being sold or suffered to be sold or used within the County and inspect the cows kept therein, and if the Medical Officer or such person has reason to suspect that any cow is suffering from tuberculosis of the udder he may take samples of the milk of such cow. Power to prohibit supply of milk. If it appears on the reports of the Medical Officer and the veterinary surgeon that tuberculosis is caused or is likely to be caused to persons residing in the County from the consumption of milk from any dairy within or outside the County or from any cow kept therein, the Council may make an order prohibiting the supply of such milk in the County until the order has been withdrawn, and any person contravening the order shall be liable to a penalty of £5, and for a continuing offence to a daily penalty of 40s. Appeal may be made against the Council's order. Obstructing Officers. Any dairyman or person in his employment refusing any reasonable assistance or obstructing the Medical Officer or duly authorised person or veterinary surgeon in his duties shall be liable to a penalty of £5. Selling milk from diseased cow. Every person who knowingly sells or suffers to be sold or used for human consumption within the County the milk of any cow suffering from tuberculosis of the udder shall be liable to a penalty of £10, and any person failing to isolate any such cow in his dairy shall be liable to a penalty of £5. 25 Notice in case of disease. Every dairyman who supplies milk within the County shall give notice to the Medical Officer of any cow in his dairy affected with or suspected of or exhibiting signs of tuberculosis of the udder, and any dairyman failing to give notice shall be liable to a penalty of 40s. For further information reference should be made to the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, copies of which can be obtained from Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, East Harding Street, E.C., or Messrs. Wyman and Sons, Limited, Fetter Lane, E.C., price 3s. 3d. each. The Council in further pursuance of Section 31 of the before mentioned Act, also gives notice that at a meeting held on the 26th May, 1908, it fixed the 1st July, 1908, as the day on which the provisions of Part IV. of the said Act shall come into operation. G. L. Gomme, Clerk of the London County Council. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., 29th May, 1908. Infectious Cases. —During the year nine cases of infectious deseases were notified in connection with Dairy and Milkshop premises, Scarlet Fever 5 cases, Diphtheria 2 cases, Enteric Fever 1 case, and Measles 1 case. In each case action was taken in accordance with the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders, the sale of milk being prohibited and vessels removed until after disinfection and certification of the premises by the Medical Officer of Health. ICE CREAM. These premises have been kept under constant supervision and all necessary cleansing and sanitary requirements were duly carried out from time to time. I am glad to report that this trade as carried on by street vendors is gradually diminishing and is being transferred more into clean and better regulated confectionery premises. The Italian vendors in the trade are also diminishing in this Borough. The number of premises on the register at the close of the year was 128, being an increase of 7 on the previous year, 26 were added during the year, and 19 were removed. The number of Inspections made during the year was 207 and it was only found necessary to serve notices for the abatement of nuisances in 7 cases, and no legal proceedings were required to be taken. The Inspector paid special attention to the washing and cleansing of the glasses and utensils used, in order to prevent the repeated usage of these as so often occurs in the case of street vendors. E 26 COWSHEDS. During the year two Cowsheds were closed, and no renewal of the license was applied for from the London County Coumcil. These were:— Clearman, Thomas, 14 Vulcan Road 1 cow. Crutcher, George, 117 Pomeroy Street 12 cows. The following are the Cowsheds in the Borough at present licensed by the London County Council:— Weston, John, 178, 182 Grove Street 14 cows. Weston, J. & Sons, 33 Octavius Street 25 cows. Do. 211 Railway Arches, Edward Street 17 cows. Total 56 cows. The periodical cleansing and limewashing has been regularly carried out in accordance with the bye-laws. Number of Cowsheds in the Borough 3 Number of Cows allowed 56 Number of Inspections for the year 58 SLAUGHTER HOUSES.

January 4th, 1909. Gentlemen, I beg to present my report under the Canal Boats Acts as follows, for the year ended 31st December, 1908:— For the purposes of inspection during the year, 32 visits have been made on the following dates, viz.:—January 15th; February 7th, 13th, 21st, and 27th; March 5th, 6th, 12th, 20th, and 26th; April 3rd, 9th, and 15th; May 1st, 7th, and 22nd; June 6th, 12th, and 18th; July 9th, 22nd, and 30th; August 21st and 26th: September 30th; October 14th, 20th, and 30th; November 18th and 27th; and December 18th. Boats were found and inspected on the following dates, viz.:— January 15th; March 5th; April 9th and 15th (2 boats); May 22nd (2 boats); July 22nd; September 30th; and October 14th. Number of visits 32 Number of boats inspected 10 Infringements. The following matters were found requiring attention:— January 15th—Boat " Clara " 99, registered at Brierley Hill—No pump aboard. Provided on service of notice. April 9th—Boat "Citizen" 146, registered at Brierley Hill—Cabin roof leaking. Repaired on service of notice. Children on Boats. During the year children of school age were found in 5 boats. In each case information was forwarded to the Local Education Authority for their attention. No cases of sickness have been found on board the boats during the year. The boats inspected were found generally in a clean, satisfactory and habitable condition. Owing to bad trade, etc., the Canal under the jurisdiction of this authority has apparently been used less than formerly. This borough is not a registration authority. The arrangements made for the inspection of boats are— Periodical inspection by Sanitary Inspector, duly appointed an inspector under the Canal Boats Acts, jointly with other duties as Inspector of Workshops, Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops, etc., etc. 30 Name and address of Inspector—Thomas Turner, 161 St. Asaph Road, Brockley, S.E. Remuneration of Inspector—£2 per annum, part of salary as a Sanitary Inspector, apportioned to these duties. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Thomas Turner, Canal Boats Inspector. THE SANITARY STAFF. At the beginning of the year the number of District Sanitary Inspectors was five. On January 14th one of the Inspectors left the Council's service. The district was then divided into four, as a temporary measure, until the vacancy should be filled. The Council, at its meeting on the 24th March, referred the matter to the Public Health Committee, with a request to report at an early date upon the steps to be taken with regard to the filling of the vacancy in the Sanitary Staff. Several meetings took place but no definite report was presented to the Council. On June 12th, the following letter was received from the London County Council and referred to the Public Health Committee:— Copy. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 12th June, 1908. Sir, The question of the adequacy of the sanitary staff of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford has recently been engaging the attention of the Council, and the Council is strongly of opinion that, having regard to the character of the district, the sanitary staff should be at once strengthened. The reasons which have actuated the Council in arriving at its decision may be briefly stated to be: (1) That since 1894 a number of duties, involving a considerable amount of additional work, has been imposed upon the Borough Council by various Acts of Parliament. (2) That, whilst the population has increased from 108,000 in 1894 to 117,500, the number of district inspectors is the same. In this connection the Council has not overlooked the fact that two inspectors, instead of one inspector, are set apart for special work. (3) That, in London generally, the average number of persons to each sanitary inspector has, in the last few years, considerably diminished, whilst in Deptford it has increased. 31 (4) That taking into consideration the whole sanitary staff, irrespective of inspectors, set apart for special work, upon the basis of the figures of the 1901 census, the average number of inspectors for London generally is one for every 14,221 of the population, whilst in Dentford it is as hierh as one for 18,400. In the circumstances, I have been directed to ask that the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford will give the matter their careful consideration and inform the Council what steps they propose to take to ensure a more adequate supervision of the sanitary arrangements of the Boroueh. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. L. Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. The Public Health Committee then constituted a sanitary staft sub-committee to enquire into the matter. This sub-committee met on five different occasions, interviewing each member of the sanitary staff, investigating his duties and inspecting the several books kept by him, but up to the close of the year no further report had been presented to the Council. I am pleased to say that during the year, Inspector Snowdon obtained a Special Certificate, after examination at the Royal Sanitary Institute, for the inspection of meat and other food. I frequently visited the Disinfecting Station during the year and am pleased to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. I desire to express my appreciation of my staff who have so ably assisted me during the year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. * Before going to press, the Council has approved of the vacancy being filled on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee.
