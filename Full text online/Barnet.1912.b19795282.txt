MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 40, High Street, Barnet. January, 1913. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting to you my Third Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1912. The District is in the Barnet Union, and includes the parishes of Chipping Barnet, Hadley, South Mimms, and Arkley, and has an area of 1,509 acres. The Town, locally known as High Barnet, stands upon a hill at an altitude of 430 feet above sea level. Upon the hill the geological formation consists of gravel overlying beds of London clay, while in the valleys the clay comes to the surface. The Town fringes the borders of Hertfordshire and Middlesex, and is situated about 10 miles from Charing Cross on what may be termed the crowning summit of the Northern Heights. The District is very bracing and healthy, for which reason it is becoming an increasingly popular residential area. NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The population is largely residential, and consists chiefly of people whose occupation lies outside the urban area. Those employed in the district, apart from tradesmen and their 6 employees, are mainly skilled workers at dental manufacturing, lithographic, and photographic printing works. Poor-law relief is supplied by a large Workhouse and Infirmary, the Medical Officer and Relieving Officer being resident in the district. The Victoria Cottage Hospital affords additional medical relief for the working and artisan classes. POPULATION. The population of Barnet taken at the Census last year was 10,440. In estimating the population of any district the estimate is always made to Midsummer, and as the Census is taken in the first quarter of the year it has been necessary to estimate from April, 1911, to Midsummer, 1912, a period of 15 months. The method of estimating the population adopted by the Registrar-General is based on the supposition that the rate of increase during the decennial period 1911 to 1921 will be at the same rate as in the previous decennial period. Such an estimate no doubt would be approximately correct in a district where the growth is more or less on a natural basis, viz., excess of births over deaths, but in Barnet, occupying as it does the position of a suburb of London, this method is obviously inapplicable, the migration being an ever increasing quantity. The more correct method in this case is to take the number of inhabited houses at Midsummer and multiply by the average number of persons per house existing at the Census. The average number of persons per house in 1911 was 4.7, and the number of occupied houses at Midsummer, 1912, 2,261. By multiplying these figures an estimated population of 10,717 is obtained. By the latter method the estimate of the population in each Parish is likewise more correct. The following table shows the number of inhabited houses, together with the estimated population for each Parish up to the middle of the year. Parish. No. of Occupied Houses. Population. Arkley 151 636 Chipping Barnet 834 4,030 Hadley 91 440 South Mimms 1,185 5,611 7 DENSITY OF POPULATION. The District has an area of 1,509 acres. The average number of persons to the acre at the Census of 1911 was 6.9. The number of persons to each acre is now estimated as 7.1. The following table gives the density of population of each parish in the District:— Parish. Area in Acres. Population. Density per acre. Arkley 830 636 0.8 Chipping Barnet 379 4,030 10.7 Hadley 27 440 16.3 South Mimms 272 5,611 20.6 BIRTH RATE. The nett number of births registered in the District during the year was 212, as compared with 224 in 1911. Of these births 93 were male and 119 female. The Birth Rate, calculated as the rate per 1,000 of the population, is 20.2, as compared with 21.3 in the previous year. The nett illegitimate births registered give a proportion of 19 per 1,000 of the total births. The following table shows the number of births recorded and the Birth Rate for each parish in the District:— Parish. No. of Births. Birth Rate. Arkley 12 18.9 Chipping Barnet 89 22.6 Hadley 7 15.9 South Mimms 104 18.6 The subjoined table shows by comparison particulars relating to births during the past three years:— 1912. 1911. 1910. Males 93 120 114 Females 119 104 103 Total Births 212 224 217 Legitimate 208 217 204 Illegitimate 4 7 13 Birth Rate 20.2 21.3 19.4 Percentage of Illegitimate Births to Total Births 1.9 3.1 6.0 8 DEATH RATE. 165 deaths were registered in the District during the past year, as compared with 182 in 1911, and 128 in 1910. The crude Death Rate is 15.4 per 1,000 of the population living at all ages, based upon the estimated population for the District. Four deaths of residents belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions outside the District, while 50 deaths not belonging to the District occurred in Public Institutions within the District. After making allowance for these deaths a nett Death Rate of 109 per 1,000 is obtained. Number of deaths of persons not belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions inside the District:— The Workhouse 42 Victoria Cottage Hospital 6 Isolation Hospital Nil Other 2 Total 50 Number of deaths of persons belonging to the District occurring in Public Institutions outside the District:— Herts County Asylum 1 Middlesex County Asylum Nil Other 3 Total 4 The following table gives the gross and nett Death Rates for each Parish within the District:— Parish. Gross Death Rate. Corrected Death Rate. Arkley 20.0 18.0 *Chipping Barnet 23.9 11.2 Hadley 2.4 2.2 South Mimms 11.9 11.9 *Union Workhouse in this Parish. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The Rate of Infantile Mortality for the past year was 86 per 1,000 as compared with 98 during 1911. 9 The average for the past 10 years has been 99 per 1,000. The Rate is calculated as the ratio of infant deaths to births per 1,000. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, has not been adopted in this District. Infantile mortality has a variety of causes, among which alcoholism, impure food, and contamination of infants' food—, improper feeding, impure milk, insanitary conditions, and overcrowding are noteworthy. The inclusion of premature births results in a considerable increase in the rate. The total number of deaths is so small that an increase of 2 or 3 premature births greatly raises the rate. Infantile diarrhoea was not very prevalent, owing partly to the wet summer and also to the improved conditions under which the children are reared. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The number of deaths from diseases of this class was 3, as compared with 6 in the previous year. The number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during 1912 (excluding 23 cases of Tuberculosis) was 48, being a decrease of 6 from 1911. The following table shows the number of Notifications to the Sanitary Authority during the year of each disease specified in the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, and the number removed to Hospital:— Nature of Infectious Disease. Notified. Removed to Hospital Smallpox .. .. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina 32 27† Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 11 8 Enteric (Typhoid) Fever .. .. Typhus Fever .. .. Cholera .. .. Relapsing Fever .. .. Continued Fever .. .. Erysipelas 5 1 * Pulmonary Tuberculosis 23 .. Cerebro-Spinal Fever .. .. Acute Poliomyelitis .. .. Total 71 36 †lncludes 5 from Poor Law Union. *Removed to London. 10 JOINT ISOLATION HOSPITAL. This Hospital is controlled by a Joint Committee of the Barnet, East Barnet Valley Urban, and Barnet Rural District Councils. The accommodation is for 8 cases of scarlet fever, 4 of diphtheria, and 4 of enteric fever. The percentage of cases notified which have been removed to hospital is 73 per cent., as compared with 79 per cent. last year. The hospital urgently requires discharge, observation, and convalescent wards, the provision of which is now in hand. The proposed accommodation comprises provision for 16 extra beds, viz.:—6 for females, 6 for males, and 4 observation beds. A Local Government Board Inquiry has been held with regard to the scheme, and the Hospital Authority are now waiting for sanction to borrow the money for this purpose before proceeding with the erection of the buildings. Antitoxin is provided free to all practitioners in the district. The Council have also made arrangements to examine and report, through the Clinical Research Association, on all suspected cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever. The Equifex steam disinfector is available for all hospital and patients' bedding. WATER SUPPLY. The District is supplied with water from the mains of the Barnet Water Company. The water is derived from deep wells sunk into the chalk, situate: 1 at East Barnet, 3 at New Barnet, 1 at Potters Bar, and 1 at Tyttenhanger, Colney Heath. The supply has been good during the past year, and no complaints have been received. I append the report of the Public Analyst upon a sample of water taken from a domestic tap in the District:— 11 WATER ANALYSIS. Report on the Chemical Analysis of Water. Taken from a Domestic Tap.

Tube clear Hardness before boiling 20 degrees Hardness after boiling 5½ „ This is water of a very high degree of purity as regards freedom from contamination. This is indicated by the results of a vigorous bacteriological examination as well as by those of the chemical analysis. DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The House Refuse is collected weekly by the Council's own staff, and conveyed to the Farm. The provision of a small destructor will become necessary at some future date in order to deal with it. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The town is sewered and drained on the separate system. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres. The scheme of sewage disposal adopted by the Council is nearly completed, and provides for the mechanical treatment of the sewage through three rotary filters before being passed on to the land. Mr. Fairley, Victoria Street, Westminster, is the engineer for the scheme. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The Slaughter Houses have been frequently visited by the Sanitary Inspector, as in previous years. The Inspector 12 possesses the special qualification, as Inspector of meat and other food, granted by the Royal Sanitary Institute. This qualification is now urged by the Local Government Board in their memorandum as to annual reports, who require information upon the subject. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. There are six schools in the district, viz.:—Arkley C.E. Infants' School; Barnet C.E. Boys', Girls', and Infants' Departments; Barnet C.C. School, with Boys' and Girls' Departments; Christ Church School, with Boys', Girls', and Infants' Departments; Hadley Infants' School; and Moxon Street Infants' School. The following school has been closed during the year on account of an outbreak of infectious disease. SCHOOL. PERIOD OF CLOSURE. NATURE OF DISEASE. Arkley Infants' School. 2 weeks. Scarlet Fever. The sanitary condition of the schools is satisfactory, and the drainage system of each school is periodically tested. The water supply is adequate and pure. The scholars are medically examined every three years by the Assistant School Medical Officer, and in addition the schools are visited each term by him. Doubtful cases of infectious disease are referred to him, and contacts examined and excluded if necessary. The school buildings are disinfected every vacation, and after any outbreak of illness. Closure of the schools is only advised after all other means of checking the spread of the disease have been employed. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER AND ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. A General Order was issued by the Local Government Board in August, making the above diseases compulsorily notifiable, and giving the same powers in relation to them as are contained in the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, for dealing with with other notifiable diseases. I am pleased to say that no notification was received during the year of either disease. 13 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912. The above Order issued during the year extends the previous Orders so as to make all forms of Tuberculosis compulsorily notifiable. It was previously restricted to Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Now, Tubercular glands and bones and Tabes Mesenterica are included in the list. Arrangements are being made for the establishment of a Tuberculosis Station in Barnet in accordance with the provisions of the National Insurance Act. The County Tuberculosis Officer will be in charge of the Station, and will, in conjunction with local practitioners, treat the patients. The duties devolving upon the Health Department in carrying out these regulations are very numerous, and entail a considerable amount of time. Not only have all fresh notifications to be attended to, but those patients notified in previous years have to be visited from time to time and kept under observation. Of the 29 cases notified during 1911, seven patients died during that year, 12 notifications were transferred to other Districts when the patients ceased to reside in this District, and consequently no further action could be taken by this department. Three patients died during the past year, six are still living in the District, and in the remaining case there is no further trace of the patient. The following table gives particulars of the cases notified during the past year, and the action taken in respect of them:— 14 15 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBER CULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912.

SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. HEALTH DEPARTMENT, 40, High Street, Barnet. January, 1913. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you my Fourth Annual Report, giving particulars of the measures carried out in my Department during the year 1912, in administering the numerous Health Acts and Bye-laws in force within the District. Although little public health legislation has been passed during the year, a number of Orders have been issued by the Local Government Board, which have the effect of statutory enactments, in so far as their provisions are compulsory upon Local Authorities, and therefore the necessary machinery must be set up in order to carry them into force. The progress made by the Council in the previous year has been maintained in all matters relating to the health of 33 the District. The Housing scheme is well advanced, and the Council are pledged in the coming year to further develop the Estate by building some smaller cottages for pensioners and others. The schemes for the proper treatment of the sewage of the District and the repaying of the High Street are practically completed, and cannot fail to have a good effect upon the health and comfort of the community. Perhaps the outstanding feature of the year from a sanitary point of view, is the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the Local Government Board to enquire into the position and uses of the Intercepting Trap in connection with house drainage. The report, which favours the abolition of the Trap, has been the subject of considerable criticism, and as it is left to individual Councils to retain or alter their Bye-laws so as to make its provision optional, it is a matter which deserves the utmost consideration. As to the merits or demerits of the Trap, naturally the Council as a body are not in a position to judge, and therefore to a large extent must rely upon the advice tendered by their officials. My remarks upon this subject, and local conditions, appear under the heading of drainage work. The Milk and Dairies Bill had to be again dropped, but there are signs that a useful measure will shortly be enacted, which will enable Local Authorities to finally stamp out tuberculosis in dairy cattle, and thus prevent the continuous stream of disease-laden milk which at present forms a great volume of our milk supply. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1875. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT AND REMOVAL OF NUISANCES. The general inspection of the District has been carried out periodically as in previous years, such nuisances as were discovered being dealt with under the nuisance clauses of the above Act. A preliminary notice is served upon the person in default, requiring him to abate the nuisance, and for that purpose to carry out the work specified in the notice. Should the person fail to comply with the notice, the matter is reported to the Council, and a statutory notice is served, but I am pleased to say this latter recourse is seldom necessary. 34 Often the tenant is found to be responsible for certain nuisances which are not of a structural character, and in these cases notices are served upon them to procure their abatement. I am pleased to state that in no instance was it necessary to institute Police Court proceedings to secure compliance with a notice. The following table shows the number and nature of the nuisances dealt with during the year :— NATURE OF NUISANCE. No. Choked condition of drains 6 Defective drains 8 Dilapidated paving of yards 8 Absence of paving to yards 10 Accumulations of manure and other refuse 21 Fowls improperly kept 5 Offensive and defective gullies 1 Defective and obsolete water-closet cisterns 25 Insufficient water-closet accommodation 2 Insufficient gully accommodation 3 Defective roofs of houses 7 Defective eaves and down spouting 34 Defective and unventilated soil pipes 1 Nuisances caused by defective urinals 1 Overcrowded houses 3 Defective walls, ceilings, and floors 16 Insufficient ventilation of rooms 1 Nuisances caused by damp walls 4 Defective and obsolete water-closet basins 14 Defective sinks and sink waste-pipes 3 Dilapidated outbuildings 18 Dirty houses 3 Absence of water supply to water-closet cisterns 12 Cesspools abolished 1 207 CARAVANS USED AS DWELLINGS. The usual inspection was made of the caravans which entered the District to attend Barnet Fair, in order to see that they were kept in a cleanly condition and that no illness existed amongst the inmates which might be of an infectious character. 35 On the whole the caravans were found to be kept in a very fair condition, and no infectious disease was found to exist. The usual sanitary accommodation was enforced, 8 earth closets being erected in three different parts of the Fair for the use of the van dwellers. In addition temporary conveniences were erected for the public at High Barnet Station and at the foot of the Hill in the East Barnet Valley area. There was an improvement in the manner in which the shell fish stalls were conducted, the filthy practice of throwing fish-shells on the ground being stopped. Better weather conditions prevailed, and consequently the cakes and sweets exposed for sale did not get into the filthy condition which in the previous year necessitated the seizure of some quantity of them. COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. The Common Lodging-houses within the District are two in number. The accommodation provided is the same as in the previous year, viz., for 54 lodgers. One house is a mixed Lodging-house, and the other for males only. Midnight inspections were carried out during Barnet Fair, as on other occasions, and I am pleased to say that the Bye-laws as regards overcrowding were not infringed, and the premises were conducted generally in a satisfactory manner. Cards are affixed in each room prescribing the number of persons who can be accommodated therein. UN50UND FOOD. The premises wherein food is stored and prepared for sale have received the same attention as in former years, with a view to securing that it is prepared under hygienic conditions and that no unsound food is exposed for sale. During the course of my inspections I discovered at a certain butcher's shop a portion of the lungs of a beast which was tubercular. One lobe had already been sold. I proceeded into the slaughter-house at the rear and found certain organs of a beast, including bronchial glands, mediastinal glands, mesenteric fat and glands, to be very tubercular, but a very searching examination of all the deepseated glands could not reveal any of the carcases upon the 36 premises to be affected. The portions seized were destroyed upon the receipt of a Magistrate's Order. The matter was reported to the Council, and it was decided to request the owner to appear before the Council and give an explanation of the circumstances. This he did, and, after very careful consideration, it was decided to caution him. In this particular instance the animals were slaughtered between 10 and 11 p.m. on the previous night, and frequently killing is in progress at the various slaughter-houses at 8 o'clock in the evening; and although visits are often paid in the evening as well as in the day-time, it is obvious that the inspection under the system of private slaughter-houses is far from perfect, such as is the case where butchers all slaughter in a public abattoir under the constant supervision of the Health Department. The provision of a public abattoir for Barnet may be considered impracticable at the present time. This depends entirely upon the point of view as to whether it should be made a public health question or a commercial one. One thing is certain—that the public must run the risk, which is not an infrequent one, of conditions such as I have described above, so long as the system of private slaughter-houses exists. On another occasion I received information that a beast which was very emaciated had been slaughtered on unlicensed premises early in the morning, and was being conveyed into the town. As my information was very imperfect I had some difficulty in tracing the matter. After instituting enquiries I visited certain stables, but found them locked. The occupier, who saw me enter the yard, had disappeared when I came out to require admission to the stables. I accordingly set a trap for him, the result of which I found him hiding in a lane near. Upon seeing me he ran away. I caught him, and on gaining admission to the stables I found the hide, but not the carcase. The occupier, in reply to my question, said it had gone to the knacker's yard. To satisfy myself that the carcase had not gone for human food, I proceeded to the only two yards within some miles of the town and found that this information was untrue. A few days latter I received information from which there was very little doubt that the carcase had gone for human food to a district a few miles away, and it is very probable that this carcase was affected with some organic disease. The difficulties of dealing with this illicit meat traffic are very great, and necessitates long watching of the class of persons who deal in " slink " meat. 37 INFECTIOUS DISEASES PREVENTION ACT, 1890.

Totals 48 12 54 15 31 9 Of the 32 cases of Scarlet Fever notified, 8 occurred in the Workhouse, where an unfortunate outbreak occurred towards the end of the year and was undoubtedly spread owing to the inability of the Guardians to obtain suitable isolation for the earlier cases. Ultimately six cases were taken by the Barnet Joint Hospital Authority, and the other cases were removed to the Edmonton Hospital. The outbreak had not spent itself at the close of the year. But for this outbreak the total number of cases for the year would have been exceptionally low. The number of cases of Diphtheria notified, viz., 11, is very satisfactory, and may be considered almost as a minimum when it is taken into consideration that there are other factors apart from local conditions which may be responsible for certain cases. The inter-communication with other large centres and the consequent risk of importation of the disease must not be forgotten. These are factors over which often no control can be exercised. Numerous visits have been paid in connection with the 38 notification of Tuberculosis, particulars of which cases appear in the Medical Officer's report. At each house visited advice is given for the prevention of the spread of the disease, and printed instructions are also left. In certain cases spittoons and disinfectant fluid are given to the patients, with a view to promoting cleanly habits. A register is kept of all cases of Consumption, giving necessary particulars. The results of the investigations are made to the Medical Officer, who also visits most of the cases during the year. OFFENSIVE TRADES. Bye-laws were drafted to deal with the trades which the Local Government Board declared by Order to be offensive. These were submitted to the Council, and afterwards to the Board. They were not, however, approved by the Board, who state that they are too stringent. It is essential in a residential district to guard against the occurrence of any possible nuisance, and this will be borne in mind when the re-drafted bye-laws are submitted. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The above Acts are enforced by the County Authority in this District. The following table shows the number and nature of the samples taken in the Urban District of Barnet during the past year, with the results of analyses:— Article. Number of Samples taken.

Thirty-four houses wherein cases of infectious disease occurred have been disinfected under my direction and supervision, after the patient had been removed to hospital or when the patient is kept at home after convalescence. In addition, various wards in the Workhouse wherein the remaining cases occurred were disinfected on three occasions. The system of disinfection used is by spraying the rooms with formaldehyde, the scrubbing of floors, skirtings, and woodwork generally, and the removal for disinfection by means of the steam disinfector of all bedding and other articles which can be dealt with in this manner. Disinfection is also undertaken of rooms vacated by consumptives, and bedding is removed to the steam disinfector where necessary. The steam disinfector has been used on all possible occasions in connection with the preventive measures employed to stamp out the various forms of infectious disease, and since it has been in use, has undoubtedly been productive of good results. One school was disinfected after the closure of the school owing to the prevalence of infectious disease amongst the scholars. During the school holidays the whole of the schools in the District were thoroughly disinfected as a precautionary measure. Two private schools wherein outbreaks of measles occurred were also disinfected. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, & MILKSHOPS ORDER, 1885. There are 17 Dairymen, Cowkeepers, and Purveyors of Milk upon the Register. Two applications for registration have been made during the year. (Article 6.) Special attention is given to the inspection of these premises, in order to secure that the milk supply shall be as free as possible from contamination. 40 Plans were submitted and approved for the erection of a cowshed in place of the one that was damaged by fire, and mentioned in my previous report as being repaired, but in my opinion unfit to be used as a cowshed. The cowshed has been erected, and conforms with the Order as regards cubic capacity, construction, etc. In one instance it was necessary to caution a Dairyman, whose milk was found to contain a considerable amount of foreign matter. Eight notices were served requiring cleansing and limewashing of cowsheds. It is to be regretted that the surroundings of some of the cowsheds are still in very bad condition, owing to the soft nature of the ground. In certain cases the Cowkeepers have been asked to remedy this, and in one instance notice was served upon the owner requiring the provision of a system of land drains. This work is to be put in hand as soon as the conditions are satisfactory. Notices have also been served requiring the removal of the manure heap where this was found in too close proximity to the dairy. The various shops in the town which sell milk in small quantities have been visited and the milk utensils examined. They were found to be kept clean, and the milk appeared to be free from contamination. It is very possible that the Milk and Dairies Bill will have become law before the end of another year, and thus enable the principles of hygiene to be more rigidly enforced in dealing with this important food supply. RAG FLOCK ACT, 1912. Two samples of Flock were obtained under the provisions of the above Act, and submitted to the Public Analyst. Both samples were found to contain chlorides in excess of the standard laid down. The Council decided that I should interview the persons concerned, upon the matter. This I did, and they have intimated their intention to require a guarantee with all flock purchased in future. 41 PRIVATE SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are 5 Slaughter Houses in the District. Two of these are licensed and 3 registered. With the exception of one of the slaughter houses their structure is good. Steps will shortly be taken to secure an improvement in this case. The slaughter houses are inspected as opportunity permits, both in the daytime and in the evening, in order to supervise to some extent the meat supply, but the difficulty of proper supervision of private slaughter houses is illustrated in my remarks upon food inspection. The frequent removal of garbage is insisted upon, especially during the hot weather. Particulars of meat inspection are given under the heading of Unsound Food. I am pleased to say that in no instance was it necessary to serve a notice upon the occupiers of these premises with respect to cleanliness. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTS (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1907. PAVING OF YARDS AND PASSAGES. Sixteen notices have been served under section 25 of the above Act to properly pave or flag the surfaces of yards with some hard impervious material. These paving works serve the purpose of keeping the area round houses drier and cleaner, and remedy to a great extent the dampness which is so frequent in walls of cottage property. The three notices outstanding last year have been complied with, and also the whole of the notices served during the past year, leaving no outstanding notice for this work. The usual method of paving carried out is that of concrete, and the area required to be paved is fixed by your Inspector according to the necessity of each case, but a certain minimum is always insisted upon. PROVISION OF SINKS TO DWELLING-HOUSES. Eighteen notices have been served under section 49 to provide sinks to houses. Seventeen notices have been 42 complied with, leaving one outstanding at the end of the year. The four notices outstanding at the end of the previous year have been complied with. I am pleased to say that the number of cottages which now exist in the District without adequate provision for dealing with waste water is very few. From the point of view of cleanliness a sink to every cottage is essential. DOWNSPOUTS CONNECTED TO DRAINS. A large number of downspouts exist in the District which are connected directly to the drains, and consequently these downspouts act as ventilation shafts. This is in contravention of section 37 of the Act of 1907, and when dealing with drainage work this section is enforced, and also in cases of ordinary repairs. BYE-LAWS. Bye-laws are in force within the District dealing with the following subjects :—Nuisances ; Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops ; Common Lodging Houses; Removal of House Refuse; and Buildings. In my last report I urged the desirability of adopting fresh bye-laws dealing with new buildings. I am pleased to say the Council has decided to do so, and when these are passed it will be possible to re-submit the bye-laws dealing with the drainage of existing buildings, which the Local Government Board refused to pass, owing to the fact that they required a better class of work than could be enforced under the Building Bye-laws. This will enable a uniformity of work being carried out in new and existing buildings. FRIED FISH AND POTATO SHOPS. Pending the passing by the Local Government Board of bye-laws dealing with Fried Fish Shops, it is not possible to take any steps to secure the necessary structural alterations that will be required to certain of these premises. 43 DRAINAGE WORK. This work is receiving the same careful attention as in previous years. That residents are convinced of the necessity, from a health point of view, of efficient drainage is evidenced by the number who yearly make application for the drains of their premises to be tested. These applications receive attention, and where defects are found notices are served upon the owners to secure the necessary remedial works. A great deal of time is taken up in carrying out this branch of sanitary work, as the testing, taking up and relaying of a single drain necessitates numerous visits to give instructions, supervising work in progress, and testing the new lengths of drain. Two houses have been reported upon as being without drains sufficient for the effectual drainage thereof. Resolution was passed in each instance authorising me to serve notices under Sec. 23 of the Public Health Act, 1875, to provide sufficient drainage and connect with the main sewer. Nine drains were reported upon and examined under Sec. 41 of the Public Health Act, 1875, while the remaining drains were smoke tested. The total number of drains to houses and other premises reconstructed during the year was 31. Eleven houses were found to be without sufficient watercloset accommodation. In each instance this accommodation was provided. The work of supervising the reconstruction of these drains has received careful attention, and repeated visits were made to the premises while the works were in progress. In carrying out this construction work 817 yards of glazed earthenware pipes, 48 gullies, 10 intercepting traps, 22 pedestal, etc., water-closets, 6 soil pipes; 20 ventilation shafts were fixed and 33 manholes built; the number of tests applied to the drains being 109 water tests and 19 smoke tests. The following is a list of the premises the drains of which have been relaid under my supervision :— 44 Situation of Premises. Materials used in Construction, &c. Remarks. No. of Houses.

It is obvious that local conditions vary in the different districts. My experience during the past four years in Barnet has been that the trap works well, the number of cases in which it has been found choked being exceedingly few. The town being situated on a hill, the gradients are everywhere good, and with proper care in the fixing of the trap there is practically no danger. On the other hand, unless the sewers in the district are modern and self cleansing there would be a distinct danger to health by the ventilation of these sewers through the private systems, and as we know the sewerage system in Barnet to be old, the necessity of retaining the trap exists, thus preventing deleterious gases finding vent round the dwelling houses. EXAMINATION OF DRAINAGE OF SCHOOLS. Permission was obtained from the School Managers to examine the drainage of the Elementary Schools in the district. This work was carried out during the summer holidays. As was to be expected, after the extensive repairs executed last year, very few defects were found, and these were immediately rectified. CESSPOOLS, EARTH AND PAIL CLOSETS. The policy carried out during the past few years of connecting up premises in outlying parts of the District with new sewers laid has had the effect of abolishing a number of cesspools and earth closets. There are a few cottages in the District where it is not possible to drain into the sewer. In these cases the Council undertake the cleansing of the earth closets. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. WORKSHOPS. No notice of any new workshop has been received during the year from the Home Office. The total number of Workshops upon the register is 55, being a decrease of two on the previous year. 46 One workshop was found to be without the factory abstract affixed as prescribed by sec. 128 of the Act. A card is affixed in each room stating the number of persons who may be allowed to work in such room during ordinary working hours, and also when overtime is worked. The cubic capacity required for each person is 250 cubic feet during ordinary hours and 400 cubic feet during overtime. Where any infringement of the Act was found, the occupier was at once notified to remedy the neglect or default. FACTORIES. FIRE ESCAPE AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The fire escapes have all been maintained in good condition and free from obstruction. One factory was without proper means of escape in case of fire. As the factory, which had been vacant, was reoccupied during the year, I insisted upon proper means of escape being provided. An iron staircase was provided with exits thereto from each floor. The sanitary conveniences in the factories were found to be kept in a cleanly condition, and to be sufficient in number. BAKEHOUSES. The number of bakehouses upon the register is 9. This includes one underground bakehouse not in use. The special requirements of the Act with respect to these premises have been enforced, and I am pleased to say the food is produced under very fair conditions. Special attention is always given to the drainage, paving, and cleanliness; and limewashing is enforced at least twice a year. OUTWORKERS. Eight lists of outworkers have been received in accordance with sec. 107 of the Act as follows :— Six lists from firms within the District, all employing outworkers who are living in the district. 47 Two lists of outworkers employed by firms within but who are living outside the district. These lists were sent to the Councils concerned. Five addresses of outworkers living in the district received from other Councils. The outworkers premises were visited in compliance with the Act, but in no case has any infectious disease occurred in them, and the conditions of the workers were satisfactory. Tables giving particulars of Factory and Workshop appear on pages 27 to 29. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. HOUSING AND TOWN PLANNING ACT, 1909. INSANITARY PROPERTY. Thirteen houses have been condemned during the past year as unfit for human habitation. The total condemned since my appointment, a period of 4 years, is 118. The following are the particulars of the action taken during the year with regard to the individual properties condemned, and also the property condemned in the previous year, but in respect of which no action had been taken up to the end of that year. The number of houses reported upon in the previous year which had not received attention up to the end of the year, or which were in hand at the end of the year, was 19. These have been dealt with as follows :— Nos. 1 and 2, Bennett's Cottages, Wellhouse Lane. At the request of the owner the consideration of the question of the demolition of this property was held over from last year. When the matter was again brought up for consideration, the owner not having taken any steps in the meantime with regard to the property and having no scheme to place before the Council, it was resolved to order the demolition of the cottages. Notices to this effect were served upon the owner, who demolished the property. Nos. 1 to 15, Gladstone Place (\5 houses). This property, which was reported to the Council in the previous year, had not received attention, owing to the trustees being in different parts of the world. 48 As a result the negotiations were protracted, but it was ultimately arranged to place the property into a habitable condition. The works necessary for this purpose included the underpinning of the walls and inserting of damp-proof courses, the erection of 15 new water-closet buildings, new drainage to the whole of the houses, concreting for a width of 8 feet along the back, the provision of concrete over the site, new joists and floors; staircases, window-frames, roofs, doors, &c., were overhauled and new provided where necessary. A stormwater sewer was laid by the owners, and the whole of the property was roughcasted. It is now in a thoroughly habitable condition. No. 121, Wood Street. It will be remembered that I was unable to secure the closure of this property, owing to an inmate being bedridden, as it was thought at the time that her removal would involve risk. I am pleased to say that this difficulty has now been got over, the occupiers electing to remove themselves, and the bedridden person being moved by the kindly aid of the St. John Ambulance. The cottage is now empty, and as the owner has persistently ignored the notices of the Council, steps are being taken to secure its demolition. Oak Cottage, Bells Hill. This cottage, which was closed in the previous year, was demolished without it being necessary to serve a notice to this effect. Nos. 1 to 4, Black Horse Cottages. The necessary period having elapsed, these cottages, which were closed in the previous year, were reported to the Council with a view to securing their demolition. Orders were accordingly made, and the owners demolished the cottages. In this connection a footpath over land in front of this property was closed as a result of an application to Quarter Sessions. This footpath was of no value, and frequent complaints had been received of nuisances committed upon the land. 49 No. 123, Wood Street. The owner of this house was notified of the time and place when the question of demolition would be considered by the Council, but failed to attend. I therefore requested the Council to serve an order for its demolition. This was done and the house demolished. With regard to the property dealt with during the year— a total of 11 houses and 2 shops—the following action has been taken :— Nos. 166 and 168, High Street. This property consisted of two shops and houses, one of the houses being let in two tenements. I had an interview with the owners and pointed out the insanitary condition of the property, and stated that it would be necessary to serve closing orders in respect of it. The property was at once closed, and orders were given for its demolition, which has now been carried out. Nos. 1 to 7a, Anstee's Yard (8 houses). These cottages are situated in a yard off Union Street, and are practically back to back. They are in a dilapidated condition and deficient in ventilation. Their condition was reported to the Council, and closing orders were served upon the owner. A scheme was submitted for turning these eight houses into four, and thus secure through ventilation. This was approved by the Council conditionally, but nothing having been done to the property to carry the scheme into effect, I requested the Council to take steps to close the property, as the closing orders had become operative. This step will shortly be taken. No. 5, Tapster Street. This house was rendered unfit for habitation owing to the fact that certain rooms were practically devoid of light and ventilation. Structural alterations are necessary to render it fit, which must include the provision of windows to certain bedrooms in 50 place of present borowed light, and downstairs by converting two rooms into one good living-room, one of these rooms being totally devoid of light. Closing order was served upon the owner, and the house is now closed, but the owner has given instructions for the necessary structural alterations to be carried out. As the properties dealt with during the past four years constituted the greater part of the insanitary property in the District which could be dealt with as unfit for human habitation, I think it well to give in table form appended particulars of the total properties dealt with in this period. Table showing action taken and present position of properties dealt with as unfit for human habitation :— 1909 TO 1912 INCLUSIVE. Year. No. of Properties condemned. Closed. Demolished. Put into habitable condition. 1909 53 ... 26 1910 28 3 1 23 1911 24 4 12 12 1912 13 2 12 15 Totals 118 9 25 76 From the above table it will be seen that 64% of the property condemned has been put into a habitable condition ; 7% of it remains permanently closed; 21% has been demolished ; while the remaining 8% is in hand and will possibly be demolished. The work of putting these properties into repair necessitated for the most part extensive structural alterations and additions, a number of houses being practically reconstructed. This work has cost some thousands of pounds, but of its necessity, and the immense benefit from the point of view of health and comfort of the tenants, and the improvement of the District as a whole, there can be no doubt. It is only natural that persons with vested interests try to gain any advantage there is to be obtained for themselves, and in dealing with such a complex problem as is presented by insanitary property the obstacles are many. I think it is worthy of note that in dealing with this property, which has often involved the consideration of many delicate questions, the whole of the work has been carried out 51 without the Council being faced with any of the worries of possible litigation, or by an appeal being made to the Local Government Board against any action taken. There are still a few isolated cases where property will require to be condemned, but now that the greater portion has been dealt with it will be possible to deal in a systematic manner with other properties in the District, which, although not unfit for habitation, still require the very necessary house survey provided for in the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, and a number of these houses will be dealt with each year in the future. I estimate that there are at least a thousand houses in the district which need a survey. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Proceedings were taken in respect of the following case, viz.:— (1.) Application was made to the Court for a summons against William Gridley, of 191, High-street, Barnet, for obstructing your Inspector in the execution of his duties. The summons was granted, and came on for hearing before the Court on the following week. It had come to my notice that the defendant had been habitually depositing meat in his yard for the purpose of preparation for sale. I accordingly requested permission to enter his premises for the purpose of inspection. Right of entry was refused, and consequently legal proceedings were instituted against the occupier. After a careful hearing of the case, the Chairman stated that he was willing to suppose that the defendant did not properly understand the law on the subject, and, under these circumstances, fined him 10s. and 5s. 6d. costs. Early in the year I was authorised to take proceedings against the owner of a ditch, which was a source of recurring nuisance. Before the proceedings were taken the owner complied with my notice requiring the piping-in of the ditch, and the need for taking proceedings was obviated. HOUSING SCHEME. Some delay has occurred in carrying out the second instalment of the Housing Scheme, the 22 additional cottages sanctioned by the Local Government Board to be built in Totteridge Lane not being commenced until late in the year. 52 This delay was due to the effects of the railway strike. Tenders were invited, but all were excessively high, and it was necessary to postpone building operations until prices of materials had dropped. Later, fresh tenders were invited, and the tender of £4,179 for the 22 cottages was accepted, being £190 per house, exclusive of legal and other expenses. These cottages will now shortly be ready for occupation, and will be let at a rental of 7s. per week. The accommodation is slightly larger than is provided in the Mays Lane cottages. About five acres of the Estate not needed for immediate development is let off for allotments, there being 31 allotment holders, who are chiefly tenants of the Council's cottages. The Council's total investments to date are: Land, £2,500; 30 cottages, Mays Lane, £5,810; and 22 cottages, Totteridge Lane, £4,700; making a total of £13,010. A deficit of over £100 accrued before the Mays Lane cottages were occupied, but this has been reduced in the 18 months during which the property has been occupied to £26 2s. 5d. This would have been still further reduced but for the fact that the repayment of principal and interest on the whole 14 acres has been charged to these cottages, which therefore are bearing the whole burden of the estate. It is intended as soon as the Totteridge Lane cottages are completed to erect a number of small flats for old couples, to be increased in number if the demand exists. There is a demand for cottages at about 5s. 6d. per week, and a good number of these will be erected in conjunction with the flats. It is proposed that the accommodation to be provided in these classes of dwellings shall be—(a) In old couples' flats: one good living-room, and bedroom, with similar kitchener, sink and copper as in the other houses, but without the bath. (b) In the small cottages: a good kitchen, with scullery, and two bedrooms. As the utmost accommodation possible for the money will be provided in these cottages, I am afraid the bath will have to be left out in this type of cottage, as it could be provided only by the reduction in the size of rooms, and in this instance I believe good-sized rooms to be of most value to the tenants. 53 With the completion of the Totteridge Lane cottages, the total annual charges against the Estate amount approximately to £902, and the estimated income to £917. As it is somewhat difficult to sum up the actual position of the scheme from the estimates of income and expenditure submitted each half-year, I am, in response to requests, presenting below a balance sheet to March 31st.

In the instalments of principal and interest (£200) paid during the half-year a sum of £19 3s. 10d., repayment of principal and interest, is included for Totteridge Lane Cottages, which are not yet occupied. Allowing for this, the actual deficit on the Mays Lane Cottages is seen to be £26 2s. 5d., or rather less than was estimated. 54 The deficit existing at September, 1911, on the whole estate was over £100, which chiefly comprised repayments of principal and interest on land which had been idle for nearly 18 months prior to the cottages being occupied. It will be seen that this deficit has been reduced very substantially in the 18 months the first 30 cottages have been occupied. It may be of interest to state that the 30 cottages in Mays Lane, during the 18 months they have been occupied, have paid in rates and taxes the following sums:—Poor Rate, £100; General District Rate, £48; Income Tax, at 1s. 2d. in the £, £50. While the repayments of Principal and Interest have amounted to £476. Other charges, such as Tithe Water Rate, repairs, insurance, etc., have amounted to £87. TOWN PLANNING. The question of town planning a portion of the District of about 100 acres, situate between Mays Lane and the boundary of the district at Prickler's Hill, was postponed, as it was considered that any town-planning scheme should have a much more extended scope, and at the time this report is printed it has been decided to apply to the Local Government Board for power to plan the whole of the parish of Arkley within this District, and also the parish of Totteridge, situate within the Rural District of Barnet. Action with regard to the latter parish was proved to be a wise step, as an adjoining authority, situate in Middlesex, shortly after notified the Herts County Council that they intended to apply for powers to plan this parish. The areas to be planned in the two parishes are together about 2,300 acres. Preliminary notice has been served upon every landowner within these areas. Later it will be necessary to call a conference of landowners in order to discuss with them the lines upon which the District can best be planned with advantage both to the landowners and the community, the Council reserving to themselves the power they possess with regard to the restriction of the number of houses to the acre. As the districts under review are practically undeveloped, it may be well to obtain premiated plans for the whole, 55 instead of attempting to marry together a number of plans drawn up without any reference to each other, and which consequently cannot combine the best features as regards communication, which is one of the essentials of town planning. This is a question for consideration in the near future. Barnet is delightfully situated, the surrounding country being undulating pasture land, well wooded, and lends itself admirably to high-class residential planning. The Council's Housing Estate will form part of the scheme. Town planning has been taken up by the majority of Urban Districts in the outer London area, about eighty Authorities having schemes in various stages of preparation. I have the honour to be a member of the National Advisory Committee of the Housing and Town Planning Council, and also a member of the Greater London Committee and Sub-Committee. I have therefore been enabled to keep in touch with all questions of difficulty which have arisen in other Districts, and have gathered much useful information upon the subject of town planning, which I trust will be of use to the Council in carrying into effect their proposed scheme. SANITARY LEGISLATION. RAG-FLOCK REGULATIONS, 1912. These regulations made under the Act of 1911 prescribe the standard of cleanliness required in rag-flock, whether used for bedding, cushions, or any article of upholstery. The chief clause states that " Flock shall be deemed to conform to the standard of cleanliness when the amount of soluble chlorine, in the form of chlorides, removed by thorough washing with distilled water at a temperature not exceeding 25C. (77°F.) from less than 40 grammes of a well mixed sample of flock does not exceed 30 parts of chlorine in 100,000 parts of the flock." 56 The Act will undoubtedly prove beneficial in checking the wholesale delivery of flock manufactured by the tearing up of filthy rags in an apparatus called a " devil." Much flock of this nature has been sold without any steps being taken to sterilise it. The enforcement of this Act is referred to earlier in my report. PUBLIC HEALTH (MILK AND CREAM) REGULATIONS, 1912. These regulations prohibit any preservative being added to milk, or to cream which contains less than 35% by weight of milk fat, at any stage from the place of production to delivery to purchaser. In the case of cream containing over this amount, the addition of boric acid, borax, or peroxide of hydrogen is not prohibited, but is subject to a system of declaration which is required to be followed by all persons dealing with such cream intended for human consumption. Thus, preserved cream can at all stages be distinguished from cream to which no preservative has been added. The addition of any thickening substance to cream is also prohibited. NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE ACT. This Act came into force on July 1st. A number of the clauses in this Act directly affect the Public Health Department, more particularly those relating to Sanitoria treatment and the eradication of Tuberculosis, and those sections dealing with insanitary conditions. Section 63 is of far-reaching importance and gives Approved Societies or Insurance Committees power to make representation for compensation from Local Authorities concerned if they can prove that the sickness in any district is more than 10 per cent, above the average, provided that such sickness can be proved to be due to insanitary property, impure water supply, insanitary workrooms, &c., &c. This is a section which all sanitary authorities will do well to keep in mind. In connection with the Tuberculosis provisions of the Act, Order has followed Order in quick succession during the 57 year from the Local Government Board and Insurance Commissioners, dealing with Sanatoria and Domiciliary Treatment of Tuberculous persons, and questions of administration of the Act. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS DECEMBER, 1912. These regulations consolidate the Tuberculosis (Poor Law) Regulations, 1908; the Hospitals Regulations, 1911; and the Tuberculosis Regulations, 1911, which provided for the compulsory notification of all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and in addition makes it compulsory to notify all forms of Tuberculosis, such as Tabes Mesenterica, Tubercular Meningitis, Tubercular Glands and Bones. These cases have all to be recorded, the homes of the patients visited, advice given for the prevention of the spread of the disease, and an inspection of the homes and surroundings made. These regulations come into force on February 1st, 1913. DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE'S REPORT UPON THE USE OF INTERCEPTING TRAPS. The Departmental Committee appointed in 1908 by the President of the Local Government Board to inquire and report with regard to the use of Intercepting Traps, issued its report in December, 1911, which was published during the year after being presented to both Houses of Parliament. This subject is dealt with under the heading of drainage. In conclusion, I desire to express my appreciation of the support which has always been given to me by the Council in my efforts to improve our town from a sanitary point of view, a policy which, I am sure, must add health and comfort to the community as a whole. I also desire to thank the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Hardie, for his kindly co-operation in all matters of public health. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Yours obediently, CHARLES W.
