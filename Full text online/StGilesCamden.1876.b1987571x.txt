In compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act, the Board present to the Parishioners their Annual Report, comprising the Works commenced and completed, and those in progress; the Proceedings for the Removal of Nuisances, the Improvement of the Sanitary Condition of the District; the Reports of the Medical Officer of Health, and of the Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Abstracts and Summaries of the Annual Accounts. The following Meetings have been held during the year commencing June, 1876, and ending May, 1877:— Board Meetings 28 Finance Committee Meetings 17 Works Committee „ 14 Sanitary Committee „ 19 Special Committees on various subjects 12 In all 90 Accounts. The Accounts of the Board are comprised in this Report. On perusal it will be seen that the large payments to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London School Board, for which precepts were made on this District, amounted as follows:— For the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate (comprising Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Sinking Fund, and General Expenses), the sum of £6,893 1 2 The School Board for London 5,869 8 9 Making together £12,762 9 11 8 And being more than one fourth of the whole of the expenditure of the Board. The following table shows the several amounts paid by this District to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the last ten years:— Year. Amount. £ s. d. 1867-8 7,328 12 10 1868-9 6,297 8 5 1869-70 6,303 4 0 1870-1 6,648 13 10 1871-2 4,308 14 4 1872-3 3,244 0 10 1873-4 3,434 16 0 1874-5 5,605 13 8 1875-6 6,751 15 4 1876-7 6,893 1 2 The precept for the year 1876-7 amounts to £6,700. The amounts paid by this district to the London School Board since it was constituted are as follow:— Year.

Notwithstanding the many remonstrances against the lavish expenditure of the School Board since the year 1873, and the extreme dissatisfaction expressed by the Ratepayers in all parts of the Metropolis, and the deputations to the Council on Education, the London School Board continue not only to pursue a like course of extravagance, but to increase it, as will be seen by the foregoing table, the rate for this District having since the year 1874 increased, in the year 1875, 68 per cent.; 1876, 116 per cent.; and 1877, 139 per cent. The remedy is to a certain extent with the Ratepayers, who, by re-electing the same members of the Board, have practically approved this enormous outlay. Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. Under this Act the Metropolitan Board of Works have considered the Report of Dr. Lovett, the Medical Officer of Health of this 9 Board, representing certain houses, courts, and alleys comprised within the area, bounded by Great Queen Street and Wild Court on the North; Chapel Place and King's Head Yard on the North-east; Princes Street and Duke Street on the South-east; and Drury Lane on the South-west, and known as the Great Wild Street District, were an unhealthy area within the meaning of this Act, and that its powers ought to be applied to remedy the evils existing therein. After viewing the locality, they, in the month of December, 1876, prepared, and shortly after laid before the Secretary of State for the Home Department a scheme under the Act for the improvement of the area, accompanied by plans. This scheme considerably curtailed that reported by the Medical Officer as necessary to be dealt with, by excluding therefrom the houses on the North and East sides of Great Wild Street, including Wild Court and Chapel Place, and King's Head Yard on the North-east, and a part of the North end of Drury Lane; but proposing to widen Princes Street. The Secretary of State, on the 24th day of March, 1877, caused a public inquiry to be held, before D. Cubitt Nicholl, Esq., the Commissioner appointed for that purpose, in the Board Room of this District, at which the Metropolitan Board and this Board appeared by Counsel. The scheme was fully considered, and witnesses examined thereon. The Commissioner stated he should report the same favourably to the Home Secretary. Although the area proposed to be comprised within the scheme is considerably reduced, yet it is a matter for congratulation if it should be approved by the Home Secretary, and carried out, because it will be removing a most fetid and unhealthy locality, and substituting very suitable dwellings for the artisan and labouring classes. Since writing the foregoing, the approval of the Home Secretary has been given, with the addition that Princes Street is to be widened to 40ft., and the houses, Nos. 134 to 137, in Drury Lane, are to be purchased by the Metropolitan Board, within six months after the passing of the Act confirming the Order of the Home Secretary, otherwise the Scheme is to be void. Metropolitan Streets Improvements. The Metropolitan Board of Works, in the month of November last, gave the usual notices of its intention to apply to Parliament to make six new streets in the Metropolis, two of such running through the District of this Board, viz., from Tottenham Court Road by Crown Street, Moor Street, and thence to Charing Cross; the other commencing at New Oxford Street, and running through Thorney Street, Bloomsbury Street, Broad Street, Dudley Street, and Moor Street; thence passing through the parish of St. Ann, Soho, to Regent Circus, Piccadilly. The proposed new streets would open up new thoroughfares, and would be important Metropolitan improvements; but as they would both pass through very densely crowded districts, and take an acre and a half of land to form the new streets, it would involve a permanent 10 annual loss to the District of upwards of £950 in the shape of rates, and the Bill purposed to give extensive powers to the promoters to permanently close streets, and to interfere with the sewers, paving, and other works of the District, and the Board considered that the Bill should be opposed in order that compensation should be made to the District for the loss to be thereby sustained, as also by the interference with the sewer and paving works. Petitions were presented to the House of Commons against such Bill by the Board and by the owners of property on the same and several other lines of the proposed new streets; but the Committee of the House, after several days sittings, passed the preamble of the Bill, and declined to grant the petitions of any of the opponents, save those relating to the extension of the Thames Embankment at Millbank, which it struck out of the Bill. Coal Yard and Goldsmith's Alley Improvement. By the 57 Geo. 3, cap. 29, the persons having the control of the pavements in the Metropolis are authorized to widen or extend any of the streets or other public places in their district. At the rear of the street called the Coal Yard, running out of the East side of Drury Lane, is an alley, 52 yards in length, varying in width from 4 ft. 3 in. to 2 ft. 9 in., bounded on the East side by a dwelling-house and workshops, and on the West by a dead wall, and leading to Charles Street. The workshops at the South end have been recently taken down, and the land whereon the same stood has been purchased by the Guardians of the Poor for the purposes of Casual Wards; access to the same from the Workhouse is by Drury Lane, along the entire length of Charles Street (which street, owing to the low classs of property and the habits of the population, is at all times most objectionable to traverse), or a circuitous route by High Holborn and Newton Street. The Alley, throughout nearly one half its length, is only wide enough for one person to walk at a time, and is used as a urinal, and at night is the scene of much immorality. Under these circumstances, the Board was of opinion that it would be to the public benefit and advantage that the Alley should be widened and improved by converting it into a Street, having a carriageway of not less than 14 ft., and two footways of a width of 3 ft. each. Accordingly the Board has taken steps to purchase the site of the dwelling-house, shed, and workshops, and the vacant ground, lying on the East side of Goldsmith's Alley; at an estimated cost of £3,269 exclusive of professional charges and cost of works, which sum it is estimated will be reduced by sale of the surplus land, by the sum of £1,016 to £2,253—one moiety thereof, not exceeding £1,126 10s., the Metropolitan Board of Works has agreed to contribute as a Metropolitan improvement. To carry out the improvement this Board has agreed to borrow of the Metropolitan Board of Works the sum of £3,000, at £3 15s. per cent., repayable by annual instalments, with interest, within fifty-two years. 11 Tavistock Mews, Bedford Square. This Mews, which runs at the rear of the bouses on the West side of Bedford Square, has recently been closed up, and the ground is in course of being built on. In lieu of it, the Duke of Bedford has constructed and opened a new street, adjoining to and parallel therewith, extending from Bedford Street to Tavistock Street. When the buildings on the West side are erected, it will form a great improvement in the locality. Church Lane. The dwellings in this street, which were of the worst description, and very densely inhabited by the low class of Irish, and were structurally altered and improved under orders made by virtue of the Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, have recently been pulled down, and part of the sites thereof laid into the street for the purpose of widening the same. Renaming and Renumbering Streets. The Metropolitan Board of Works have, under the powers vpsted in them by the Metropolis Management Act, 18 & 19 Vic. cap. 120, renamed the following streets in the District, viz.: Name. Renamed. King Street (Drury Lane) Shelton Street King Street (Long Acre) Neal Street Alfred Street Huntley Street Princes Street (Lincoln's Inn Fields) Gate Street Hanover Street Endell Street Colonnade Mews Colonnade Hampshire Hog Yard Clark's Mews And have ordered the houses to be renumbered; as also those in Parker Street, Drury Lane. North Metropolitan Tramways Bill, 1877. By their Parliamentary notices and plans, this Company, in November last, announced its intention to bring in a Bill to extend its tramways in the Metropolis, and among several routes it proposed to lay down rails along the new street now in course of formation by the Metropolitan Board of Works, from Old Street to Vernon Place, and thence across Bloomsbury Square and Hart Street, to Bury Place. This Board refused to consent to the application, on the grounds that it would injuriously affect the property in the streets along which the tramways would pass, and tend to drive away the present residents, thus deteriorating the value of the property and spoiling the neighbourhood; moreover, the Act 46 Geo. 3, cap. 134, for ornamenting and 12 bellishing the garden inclosure of Bloomsbury Square, prohibits the standing or plying for hire of vehicles in that Square, which prohibition the Company's Bill entirely ignored. A petition by the Board against the Bill was presented accordingly, as also one numerously signed by the inhabitants of the Square and neighbourhood. The Board was heard on its petition by a Committee of the House, and the Bill was also opposed by the Holborn District Board of Works and the St. Luke's Vestry. On cross-examination of the Company's Engineer by the Counsel of the Board, he admitted that the large open space at the West end of Theobalds Road would be a convenient space for the Company's terminal station, whereupon the Company announced that it abandoned the proposed terminus in Hart Street. The Committee of the House, after hearing the Counsel of the Holborn Board of Works and other persons against the Bill, resolved, that, looking at the length of time before which the New Street would be finished, and the other circumstances of the case, not to approve the Bill so far as it related to the new street from Old Street to Vernon Place. Water Supply. Numerous and well-founded complaints have been made by the Ratepayers on the largely increased charges of the New River Company for the supply of water in this District. The charge is calculated on the rent at what the premises are assessed, and not on the quantity consumed, which is a most unfair principle, seeing that the rental of a dwelling-house can be no criterion of the quantity of water used. The subject is now under the consideration of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, and this Board has resolved that it is desirable that the water supply of the Metropolis should be placed under the charge of a Metropolitan Authority, in order that arrangements may be made to improve the quality of the water and to reduce the cost. The Metropolitan Board of Works have resolved to apply to Parliament on the subject. Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. Under this Act the Board has endeavoured to improve the condition of the dwellings of the poorer classes in the District, and orders for that purpose have been made in respect of forty-six houses and premises in Charles Street, Drury Lane, and Tower Street. Several in the former Street have since been demolished, and others have undergone structural alterations, improvements, and repairs necessary to render them fit for human habitation. Much, however, yet remains to be done to improve parts of the District which are densely populated. TABLE—No. III.Showing the Registered Mortality in each Quarter and in each Sub-District, 1875.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— During the year ending the 31st of last March I received 241 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis. Of these 134 samples were supplied to me by your Inspector between the 1st of April and the 24th of September, 1875, while the Adulteration Acts were in operation; and 107 samples were obtained in November of last year and April of the present year, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. As milk continues to be the article most largely adulterated, a greater number of samples of this article have been obtained than any other; 132 samples of milk have been collected during the year, and of these no less than 41 were found to be adulterated, and some of them very largely adulterated. It seems to be impossible entirely to put a stop to the adulteration of milk, and it is only by having the dealers frequently visited by the Inspector that the practice, which has become so prevalent, of adding water to this important article of food, can be checked. Whenever the Inspector's attention is for any length of time drawn from this to other articles of food, the practice of diluting milk with water, or of reducing its value by the removal of cream, soon increases, and this was specially observed to be the case during the cessation of proceedings which occurred between the passing of the new Act and its coming into operation. With reference to other articles besides milk, although a large number has been collected, consisting of bread, butter, beer, cider, tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar, mustard, pepper, vinegar, preserved peas, sweets, spices, jams, arrowroot, and several drugs, adulteration has only been detected in one sample of coffee, one of mustard, and three of preserved peas. In these latter cases evidence has been afforded of considerable improvement having been effected in the genuineness of the articles supplied to the public. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 17, Bloomsbury Square, T. REDWOOD. 17th June, 1876. 1877. THE BOARD OF WORKS for the Saint Giles District.

SMITH, James, Mr., 15, Great Russell Street. 13 Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. Under this Act Dr. Redwood, of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, has, with the approbation of the Local Government Board, been again appointed the Analyst for the district. There have been 289 cases of analysis during the year. Proceedings were taken in eight cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed in such cases amounted to £13 7s. 6d. It is to be observed that the prosecutions, fines, and convictions are less than those of last year, owing to adulteration having considerably ceased, notwithstanding the number of articles analysed exceeded those of the previous year. The Report of the Analyst forms a part of this Report, and contains much useful information on the subject. Sanitary Acts. There have been several cases of prosecution under these Acts, and in all cases orders have been made by the magistrates for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. In some instances the Board have, under their statutory powers, entered on the premises and performed the necessary works, and recovered the costs of the same from the owners. June, 1877.

New Sewers. No new sewers were constructed during the year, but a contract was let for the formation of new sewers in Russell Square (North side), Marchmont Street, and portion of Great Coram Street. These works have since been completed, and will be referred to in the next Annual Report. Street Cleansing. The following staff of street orderlies were employed by the Board and constantly engaged during the year in cleansing the public ways of the District, viz.: One foreman, three gangers, thirty-one sweepers—total thirtyfive men. 27 The slop and dirt swept up were carted away by contract. Two street sweeping machines each drawn by one horse, were also used in sweeping the paved carriage ways, the whole of which were cleansed daily, with but very few exceptions, arising out of specially unfavourable weather. The macadamized roads were not cleansed so frequently; but they were carefully inspected from day to day, and were in all cases swept when their condition required it, and on the average were cleansed three times a week. The weather during the winter was generally wet, there having been 105 days between the 29tli September, 1876, and 25th March, 1877, (the six winter months), on which rain fell in large or small quantities, but there was no heavv snow fall. The following Table shows the total quantity of street sweepings carted from the District during the last three years: Date. Number of Loads of Slop and Dust Removed. Number of Loads of Snow Removed. Total of Slop and Snow Removed. 1 Year to 25 March 1875 8,581 nil 8,581 1870 10,299 787 11,086 1877 11,266 nil 11,266 It will be seen by the foregoing table that the quantity of ordinary sweepings removed during the year 1876-7, was 2,685 loads more than in 1874-5, and 967 loads more than in 1875-6. The carting away of snow is paid for by the Board at an agreed price per load over and above the lump sum which the Board contracts to pav for the carting away of the ordinary sweepings. The cost of the street cleansing, for the year ending 25th March, 1877, was as follows: £1,585 9 2 Amount paid to contractors for removal of slop, &c 2,181 16 1 Total cost of street cleansing £3,767 5 3 Difficulty having been experienced in previous years in getting the slop removed from the main thoroughfares early in the day, your Board resolved at the letting of the contract in September, 1876, for carting away the street sweepings, to stipulate that they should be removed by certain specified hours in the day, viz., from the main lines of thoroughfare by 10 a.m., from second-class thoroughfares by 1 p.m., and from the remaining public ways in the District by 4 p.m., and this has, as a rule, been done. On the 12th September, 1876, your street orderlies made application to your Board for an increase in their wages. They were then receiving,—the gangers 18s. per week, and the sweepers 16s. per week, 28 with certain allowances during illness; six days holiday were allowed them during the year, and a gratuity of 2s. 6d. per man was given on the occasion of one of their holidays towards their day's expenses. Their application was considered by your Board on the 10th October, 1876, when it was resolved to give the whole of the men an additional 2s. per week each, making their wages £1 per week for the gangers, and 18s. per week for the sweepers, on condition that they be employed simply as ordinary labourers : that no allowance be made during illness and no holidays given, and that the men be paid only for the time they are actually at work. Street Washing. It frequently happens during the summer season, after a succession of several dry days, that the dirt on the paved carriageways becomes of an extremely sticky and adhesive nature. At the morning sweeping the loose dust only, which lies on the surface, can be removed, subsequently the streets are watered—the dirt becomes mud—is worked up by the traffic—and the street obtains the appearanceof not having been cleansed. To obviate this, your Board took power in your last contracts for watering and removal of slop, to wash the main thoroughfares of the District when they became in this dirty condition. This washing has been performed on several occasions with satisfactory results. Street Watering. The public ways of the District were watered under contract; the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work per annum. It had been the custom of your Board in previous years to let the contract for street watering, in the spring of each year, immediately before the watering season commenced. During the past year it was considered desirable to let this work at the same time as the contracts for the scavenging and dusting, and this was accordingly done. The amounts paid for street watering during the last four years, and the quantity of water used for that purpose, are given in the following Table: Date. Quantity of Water Used. Amount paid for Watsr Meter Hire, &c. A mount paid for Hire of Carta. Horses, & Men. Total Cost of Work. Gallons. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

The dust and ashes have been removed from the houses in the District by contract, at a cost of £1,775. Lime-washing Courts, &c. The entrances to the mews, yards, courts, &c., in the District were twice limewhited daring the year, at a cost of £64. Public Urinals. The urinals belonging to the Board that have continued in use are the same as in the previous year, with the exception of one in Bedford Head Yard. A list of these urinals was given in last year's Report. Those that are now in use are 19 in number, and contain 47 compartments. Nine of the urinals, containing 33 compartments, have water laid on to them; the others are without water. The whole of the urinals are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. They were painted once during the year, at a cost of about £lo. Public Lighting. The subject of public lighting received much attention from your Board, the average meter system being specially considered by you. Your Surveyor reported at length on this matter on 17th May, 1876, and your Board ultimately resolved, on the 18th July, 1876, not to adopt that system for the present, but to watch for some time longer the results of the system in adjoining districts where it had been adopted; and meanwhile, with the view to improve the lighting of its District, to make the following alterations in its own arrangements, viz.: lstly. To reduce the number of lighting hours from 4,320 hours per annum, which was the number it had been for some years paying for, to 3,940 hours per annum. 2ndly. To adopt five-feet burners to all the lamps in the District, removing those of less size, and substituting five-feet burners for them. 3rdly. The adoption of a new lamp-post and lantern of less height than those previously in use, and of a pattern of lantern which the Board selected, and which was believed to allow a better light to be thrown on to the streets and with less shadow, than the old lanterns. 4thly. By a rearrangement of the lamps in the District, some of the public ways being found very liberally supplied with lamps, while others were very scantily furnished with them. The reduced consumption of gas, owing, to the lesser number of lighting hours, was estimated by your Surveyor to effect a saving of 30 about £200 per annum, and this amount your Board, on the 18th of July, 1876, ordered should be expended, together with a further amount of £200, or a total of £400 per annum, in the carrying out of the above-mentioned alterations. The number of lighting hours was consequently reduced in September last. A design of lamp-post, submitted by your Surveyor, was subsequently approved by your Board, and the works of rearrangement of the lamps, and the substitution of new for the old ones were commenced during the recent winter and are now being proceeded with. The result of these alterations has been satisfactory. Tavistock Mews. In May, 1876, application was made by His Grace the D uke of Bedford to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and subsequently, on 23rd November, 1876, to your Board, for approval of a proposed alteration in the public way of Tavistock Mews. . The Mews varied in width from 11 to 27 feet, and it was proposed by His Grace to form in lieu of it a new street, 27 feet wide throughout its whole length, and about 20 feet eastwards of the old line of Mews. After considerable negociation, the application was acceded to by your Board, on condition that the whole of the works of the formation of the new line of thoroughfare, including its sewerage, paving, lighting, surface drainage, &c., were performed in accordance with your Board's requirements, and to its satisfaction, at the expense of His Grace. This was agreed to by the Duke's agents, and the work was commenced on 24th March last, and was completed, and the thoroughfare opened to the traffic, on 5th May, 1877. Metropolitan Street Improvement Bill. Various improvements were projected during the present Session of Parliament, by the Metropolitan Board of Works, in various parts of the Metropolis, and the necessary notices, plans, and Bills, were deposited to obtain Parliamentary sanction to carry them into effect. Some of these proposed improvements involved the demolition of considerable areas of property within the St. Giles District, and, inasmuch as the deposited Bill proposed to relieve the Metropolitan Boald from the liability cast upon promoters of such schemes by the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, of making good the poor-rates during the formation of the works, your Board resolved to petition the House of Commons against the Bill, with the view of obtaining the insertion of such clauses as would protect it against the loss of such rates. This was accordingly done, and evidence given on your behalf in support of your demand ; but the opposition was unsuccessful, the Committee of the House of Commons, to which the Bill was referred, refused your application, and the Bill has since passed the House of Commons in its original form, as far as your interests are concerned. 31 The consequence of which will be, if the Bill should become law, that your District will suffer a loss when the property is demolished, and until the surplus land is built on, to the extent of nearly £4,000 per annum. North Metropolitan Tramways. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company issued notices, and deposited plans and Bill for the formation of various lines of tramway in the Metropolis, including lines in Vernon Place and the South side of Bloomsbury Square. The formation of these tramways, with their objectionable noise, the occupation of the public ways by the tram cars, and the inevitable ruts and dangerous condition of the paving, which seems to be necessarily attendant upon all tramways, was considered by your Board would be highly detrimental to the class of property in Bloomsbury Square and its vicinity, and would moreover be in direct contravention of an Act of Parliament, passed in 1806, intituled, "An Act for ornamenting and embellishing the centre or area of Bloomsbury Square," and which Act expressly prohibited the plying for hire of any hackney coach within the Square, or within the distance of 300 ft. of any house forming part of the said Square. Your Board accordingly petitioned the House of Commons against the Bill, and appeared by Counsel before the Parliamentary Committee in support of its petition. The Board's opposition was successful, and that portion of the scheme of the Tramway Company was rejected by the Committee. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— I have the honour to present you my Report on the Sanitary State of the District for the year 1876. I shall again, in order to afford a standard of comparison, place before you a few important facts, compiled from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary, relating to the whole Metropolis. "Area.—The area of London (the registration division so called) is 78,080 acres, or 122 square miles, including 2,718 acres of the Thames. The length of the streets and roads is about 1,500 miles, and their area nearly 12 square miles. The sewers have a length of about 2,000 miles." "Elevation.—The population of London reside at a mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high-water mark." "Houses.—At the Census of 1871 there were within this area 417,767 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7'8 persons to a house." "Annual Rateable Value.—In the Metropolis, in December, 1876, as assessed, was equal to £23,251,702." "Annual Rate of Increase of Population.—1851-61,1.73 per cent.; 1861-71, 1.50 percent." "1876. " Population.— Males 1,633,221 total 3,489,428." Females 1,856,207 "Birth- Male 64,920 Female 62,095 Total127,015." " Annual rate of births per 1,000 of the population, 36.5."

I am again enabled, through the courtesy of the Rectors of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, and the Registrar of Marriages, to supply the number of marriages which took place in the District dnrins' the Dast vear.

The following alterations must therefore be made to render the birth-rate a correct one. 16 births must be deducted from the entire District, and 57 from the Sub-District of St. Giles South, and 7 and 34 added to the Sub-Districts of St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles North respectively. Again, the returns of the births at the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street, record that only 24 of the mothers belonged to St. Giles District, therefore 120 births of children, belonging to other Metropolitan parishes, must be deducted from the entire District, and from the Sub-District of St. Giles South, 8 must be added to the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, and 12 to St. Giles North. The following Table displays these alterations: TABLE No. 4.— Showing the Analysis of Births in St. Giles District. St. Giles District. St. Giles South, Sub-District. St. Giles North, Sub-District.

But only 111 of these really belonged to the District, leaving 64 outsiders from vari- 39 ous Metropolitan parishes to he deducted. On the other hand, 151 deaths, which occurred in the General Hospitals and Institutions outside the District must be added to the numbers. These corrections are displayed in the next Table.

The past year was remarkable for its healthiness, and the deathrate for the entire District was only 22.30 per 1,000, a rate lower than has been recorded for the preceding nineteen years. The be death-rate for the Sub-District of St. George, Bloomsbury, was almost identical with 1875, and lower than the average for the past ten years. The death-rate for the Sub-District of St. Giles South was again lower than the preceding year, and considerably below the ten years' average. This may be partly accounted for by the absence of continued fevers, which so frequently have been prevalent in the Great Wild Street section of the Sub-District. The Death-rate for the Sub-District of St. Giles North was considerably lower than the preceding year, and likewise below the decennial average. The Death-rate among Infants in St Giles District. Excluding the deaths of 8 infants in the British Lying-in Hospital, and 13 in the Home, Great Coram Street, 278 children died under 1 year of age. Of these 67 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 124 to St. Giles South, and 87 to St. Giles North. The rate of Mortality was as follows : Whole District 1 death in every 5.38 births = 18.57 par cent. of births. St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 6.73 do. = 14.85, do. St. Giles South 1 do. do. 4.30 do. = 23.22 do. St. Giles North 1 do. do. 5'88 do.=16.99 do.

The registered deaths among persons 60 years and upwards were 225; of which 72 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 111 to St. Giles South, and 42 to St. Giles North. The rate of mortality was as follows: Whole District 1 death in every 5.29 deaths and in every 237 of population. St. George, Bloomsbury do. do. 4.70 do. do. 247 do.

The number of registered deaths among persons at all ages who died within the District was 578, of whom 148 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 270 to St. Giles South, and 160 to St. Giles North. The ratios to the whole mortality and to population are thus expressed: Whole District 1 death in every 92 of population =10.81 per 1,000. St. George, Bloomsbury 1 do. do. 120 do. = 8.29 do.

The next Table will exhibit the proportion of deaths from some of the more important diseases in the three Sub-Districts; and it will be seen that more than half the number of deaths from bronchitis, pneumonia, and phthisis, occurred in St. Giles South, which SubDistrict has long been notorious for its heavy death-rate from these diseases, chiefly caused by the density of its population and its poverty.

The total number of deaths of zymotic diseases in the year 1876 was 190, of which 7 belonged to the enthetic, 2 to the dietic orders, leaving 181 against the miasmatic order. The annexed Table displays a total of only 161 deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases in 1876, the lowest number recorded for ten previous years. This is valuable evidence of the efforts of the Board in enforcing sanitary arrangements for the improvement of the health of the District.

Small-Pox, like other epidemic diseases, is of periodical recurrence. The years when small-pox was epidemic in London were 1838, 1844, 1848, 1852, 1859, 1863, 1867, and 1871. It made its reappearance in the Metropolis as an epidemic in 1876. In the month of January, both Small-Pox Hospitals belonging to the Asylum District Board were empty. By the end of May the patients were 42. During the year these numbers steadily increased; and in the last two weeks of December there were 823 patients in those hospitals. The Registrar-General says the mortality in the present epidemic, has been higher than in the preceding one.—''During the London small-pox epidemic in 1870-1-2, 14,808 cases were treated in the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals, with a mortality equal to 18.7 per cent. During 1876, the number of completed cases treated in the same hospitals was 1,377, and the 338 deaths (46 per cent. of all the small-pox deaths in London) were equal to a mortality of 24.5 per cent." The first reappearance of small pox in St. Giles District was in May, at No. 9, New Compton Street, when two children were attacked, and soon recovered. The next case was reported to me on the 6th October, and from that date to the 31st December cases occurred in the District as shown below: Residence. Removal to Hospital. Treated at Home. Result.

The majority of the patients were sent to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board. The rooms, bedding, and clothing of the patients were disinfected as soon as they were removed. The Sanitary Inspectors incur considerable risk in the performance of this duty, and In spector Hartythus caught the disease, which laid him up for several weeks. The Guardians issued handbills urging the necessity of revaccination of persons above 15 years of age. TABLE No. 17.—Relating to Vaccination in St. Giles District.

Scarlet-Fever.—During the past year 31 of our parishioners died, either at their own homes or in the Fever Hospitals, from this disease, which showed itself in greater severity, both in St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles North, whilst only 3 deaths were reported from it in St. Giles South. The disease was very prevalent among the children of persons who reside over stables, chiefly in the several mews in different parts of the Sub-Districts of St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles North. I visited many of these dwellings, in order to ascertain the causes of this excessive sick-rate. After careful inspection, I was of opinion that the following were the probable causes: 1st. Many of the houses have defective through ventilation; the mews in which they are situate being cul-de-sacs, the current of air cannot pass through as in streets, which are open at both ends. 2nd. The houses have windows and doors in front only, and no opening at the back, sides, or top. 3rd. The water supply is mostly from a tank, which is partly or entirely underground; the pails used by the grooms to obtain water are dipped into the tank, and the water for domestic purposes is obtained from the same tank by the same means, and the water for drinking is contaminated by such an arrangement. In many cases where the tanks are not underground, they are too close to the watercloset. 4th. Bad smells arise from ill-trapped gulleys in the mews; the pebble paving holds offensive matter, which evaporates noxious gases. Robust health is impossible under these conditions. In May, a little girl was attacked with scarlet fever at the Parochial Schools, Museum Street, and was removed without delay to Stockwell Hospital. The rooms and bedding were thoroughly disinfected, and no other case occurred there. In July, the Resident Medical Officer of the London Fever Hospital, wrote to me, complaining that a woman residing in our District had removed her child from the hospital before the infectious period of scarlet fever had passed away, or the clothes had been disinfected. I immediately made inquiries, and reported the facts to your Board, who ordered proceedings to be taken against the mother, "For wilfully exposing a patient suffering from an infectious disease." The case was heard at Bow Street, and the magistrate fined the woman 20s. and costs. This case also elicited an important statement from the Medical Officer of the London Fever Hospital, "that whilst the authorities of that institution were powerless to detain their patients under such circumstances, the hospitals under the control of the Asylum Board had full power to prevent their removal, without an order from the Medical officer." 48 Subsequently, your Board drew the attention of the Home Secretary to this fact, and he referred the letter to the President of the Local Government Board. Diphtheria caused the deaths of 2 children during the year. No deaths were recorded from it in the District for the years 1874 and 1875. Whooping-Couoih.—31 children died from this disease in 1876, the decennial average being 42'7. The Registrar-General, referring to the large number of children who died in London during the week ended 19th February, 1876, said, "That more deaths were referred to whooping cough than in any week since 1840." Fever (typhus and typhoid) was fatal in 14 cases, viz.: District. Typhoid. Typhus. Total. St. George, Bloomsbury 2 l 3 St. Giles South 7 ... 7 St. Giles North 2 2 4 Entire District 11 3 14 Being 16 below the average for the past ten years. Diarrhœa.—The deaths from this disease were 55, and out of this number 41 were infants under 1 year of age, and 9 were children above 1 and under 5 years of age. This severe infantile mortality was caused by the excessive heat of the temperature during the months of July and August. The following Tables will show the localities in the several SubDistricts where the deaths occurred from zymotic diseases during the year. 49 TABLE No. 18.—Showing the Principal Localities in which Fatal Cases of the Chief Zymotic Diseases occurred in 1876.

The deaths from diseases of these organs were not so fatal as in the previous year. Bronchitis and pneumonia again headed the death list and carried off 274 of our population, and of this number nearly half resided in St. Giles South (vide, Table No. 14). These diseases are very fatal to children and aged persons, and especially to the necessitous poor, who are unable to resist the vicissitudes of weather, to which they are much exposed. Deaths from Tubercular Diseases. 178 deaths are set down to the diseases included in this order, viz., scrofula, 6; tabes mesenterica, 11; hydrocephalus, 41; and phthisis (consumption), 120. These diseases, which are often of an hereditary character, and are D 2 52 more fatal in the poorer parts of the District, may be greatly ameliorated by improved hygienic conditions. Doubtless a large amount both of the sickness and mortality arising from chest diseases may be traced to the inmates of the common lodging-houses, which abound in St. Giles. These houses are so numerous that I have obtained from the Metropolitan police authorities a correct list of them, with the number of inmates allowed to each, and have tabulated them for your information. The whole of the houses are under the active supervision of Inspecting-Sergeant Peter Pitt, 41a, Albany Street Police Station.

During the year only 6 deaths were registered as not certified, and 5 of these were deaths of children prematurely born, but the mothers were attended by qualified midwives. The reason that so few uncertified deaths are registered in the District is that in such cases the Coroner holds an inquisition. 54 Mortality in the Workhouse. 154 deaths took place in the Workhouse during the year, which include the deaths of inmates belonging to the Workhouse which occurred in the several hospitals belonging to the Metropolitan Sick Asylum Board. I have again to thank the various officers of the Guardians for their kindness in affording me valuable information. The British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street. In 1876, there were 144 births at the British Lying-in-Hospital; of these (by previous residence of the mother) 8 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 46 to St. Giles South, and 12 to St. Giles North; the remaining 120 to various Metropolitan parishes. During the year, three of the mothers (non-parishioners) died after their confinement from the following causes, viz., septicemia, placenta prsevia, and hcemorrhage. During the same period five children died (also belonging to mothers residing out of the district). With these exceptions, the health of the establishment was good. There was one case of twins, and eight of the children were still-born. The Infants' Home, No. 35, Great Coram Street. This house is established as a Refuge for Destitute Mothers, and a Home for their Infants. 13 children died in it during 1876,against 24 for the previous year. All institutions similar to this Home should be placed under Government surveillance. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. I have to thank Dr. Steele, the Resident Medical Officer, for furnishing me with the following return of medical and surgical cases under treatment during the year. Much good work is performed by the staff of the Dispensary, in alleviating the sufferings of the poor. TABLE No. 23.—Showing the Number of New Cases treated at the Bloomsbury Dispensary, 1876.

The owner appealed to the magistrates at Quarter Sessions, who refused to confirm the order. A total of 46 properties were dealt with under the Act, 19 of which were ordered to be altered and improved, and 27 to be demolished. 57 Artisans and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875. I reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the provisions of this Act, an area containing many houses and courts as dangerous to health. This area has long been a hot-bed of disease, and caused much anxiety to my predecessors, Dr. Buchanan and Dr. Ross. The area contains about 5½ acres, and 227 houses stand upon it, inhabited by 3,897 persons, as detailed below : Locality. No. of Houses. No. of Inhabitants. 1.— Great Queen Street (Nos. 47 to 58) 12 105 2.— Drury Lane (Nos. 124 to 154) 31 425 3.— Princes Street (Nos. 15 to 28) 14 315 4.— Duke Street (Nos. 18 to 44) 13 165 5.— King's Head Yard 2 11 6.— Chapel Place 6 68 7.— Great Wild Street 58 926 8.— Princes Court 3 9 9.— Brewers' Court 1 140 10.— Wild Passage 4 64 11.— Pitt's Place 7 195 12.— Orange Court 8 85 13.— Lincoln Court 21 432 14.— Wild Court 14 346 15.— Little Wild Street 27 568 16.— New Yard 6 43 Total 227 3,897 Many of the courts and passages in the above list are approached by a narrow passage under a house at either end, which renders ventilation very defective. Some of the houses are built close together, and have dark passages and staircases, others have no back yards and their sanitary arrangements are placed in the basement, health under such circumstances is impossible. This part of South St. Giles has long been noted for its heavy sick and death-rates, especially from diseases of the respiratory and pulmonary organs, and from typhus fever and other zymotic disorders, in their most contagious forms. After receiving my representation, and in addition a supplementary report asked for by the Metropolitan Board of Works, that Board twice inspected the area, and subsequently their Works and General Purposes Committee, included a portion of the representation in a scheme under this Act in the following report : "Great Wild Street Scheme (St. Giles).—This scheme relates " to a block of courts and alleys between Great Wild Street, Drury 58 "Lane, and Princes Street, and comprises some of the most wretched "houses in the Metropolis, in which the inhabitants are closely "packed. At the North end of the block are some important business "premises, which will not be taken for the proposed scheme. South "of these it will be necessary to clear away all the property up to and "including the North side of Princes Street, excepting a large pawn"broker's shop, and one or two other houses in Drury Lane. It will "be requisite to erect buildings of six stories, in order to provide "proper accommodation for the numbers to be displaced. Your Com"mittee recommend that Princes Street be widened to 30 feet; that "the projecting block of buildings at the junction of Princes Street "and Great Wild Street be removed, and that the latter street be of "a width of not less than 40 feet. The net cost of this scheme is "estimated at £49,540." The scheme of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the improvement of the locality did not embrace all that I recommended for its adoption. The Secretary of State for the Home Department ordered a public local inquiry to be held by Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols, at the offices, 199, High Holborn, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of my official representation made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, as to the area and the sufficiency of the scheme provided for its improvement, and to any local objections to such scheme. Mr. Nichols afterwards reported favourably of the scheme, subject to certain qualifications, which the Secretary of State has sanctioned, and a Bill in Parliament is now in progress to confirm it. Representation, No. 2.—Little Coram Street District. I have forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works, another representation under this Act, which refers to Little Coram Street, and its courts and alleys, scheduled as follows: Locality. No. of Houses. No. of Inhabitants. 1.— Little Coram Street 33 335 2.— Abbey Place 21 142 3.— Tavistock Mews 17 60 4.— Chapel Place 23 242 5.— Marchmont Place 22 208 6.— The Russell Institution and other houses in Great Coram Street 3 40 7.— The open spaces formerly occupied by Russell and Coram Places — — Total 119 1,027 No scheme has yet been made, as the representation is still under consideration by the Metropolitan Board. 59 Slaughter Houses. In November last the Middlesex magistrates granted a licence conditionally on the receipt of certificates from your Surveyor, that the necessary works ordered by the Board had been carried out, viz.: Locality. Licensees. 23, Store Street Mr. Balch. 60, Marchmont Street Mr. Hasbert 17, Compton Mews Mr. Phillips. 22, Wilmot Street Mr. Dunford. 24, Everett Street Mr. Edwards. 6, Drury Laue Mr. Elam.

No. of Cows. 1½, Little Wild Street Mr. Rees. 10 15, Drury Lane Mr. Gibson. 5 1, Coal Yard Mr. Lewis. 12 Animals so kept as to be a Nuisance or Injurious to Health. —In March, the owner of a stable in Southampton Mews was summoned at Bow Street Police Court for the keeping of six pigs so as to be a nuisance injurious to health. A conviction was obtained, with 12s. costs, and an order granted to prevent the recurrence of the nuisance. In July, a litter of pigs was discovered by the Sanitary Inspector in a building in New Yard, Great Queen Street. No magisterial proceedings were taking in this case, as the owner promptly abated the nuisance. In October, complaints were laid against two dealers in animals for keeping a large number of dogs on their premises so as to become a nuisance to their neighbours. In this case, also, the nuisance was abated without legal proceedings. Bakehouses have been visited and orders made, where necessary, to enforce the provision of the Act affecting those places. Rag and Bone Shops.—These shops have been kept fairly clean and regular. Mortuary.—The District is in urgent need of a proper mortuary for the reception of the dead; and when it is obtained there should be attached to it the necessary conveniences for making post-mortem examinations, with adequate accommodation for holding coroners' inquests. This would supersede the present objectionable practice of holding inquests in public-houses. 60 Underground Rooms used as Dwellings.—The notices which were served on owwers of houses for permitting their underground rooms to be illegally occupied, were generally attended to, but in one instance, where the order was disobeyed, the owner was summoned before Mr. Knox, at Marlborough Street, and find 20s. and costs, or 14 days' imprisonment. Overcrowding.—In several cases of overcrowding which occurred in the District during the year, the owners obeyed the orders made, and promptly reduced the number of inmates. It is right to notice that the health of London was remarkably good during the year, and the health of our District was as good as the rest of the Metropolis, for the death-rate of St. Giles was precisely the same as that of all London, viz., 22.3 per thousand. This fact is most satisfactory, and is strong evidence that a central district may be made as healthy as an outlying one. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. K. LOVETT, Medical Officer of Health. lst May, 1877. APPENDIX. APPENDIX TABLE I. Registered Deaths in 52 Weeks of 1876. Sub-Districts of St. Giles, Sub-Districts. (Population, 1871.)

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— During the twelve months to which this Report refers, ending on the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. Hoyle, 289 samples of various articles of food, drinks, and drugs, for analysis, consisting of bread, butter, tea, coffee, cocoa, milk, beer, gin, rum, whisky, brandy, flour, vinegar, arrowroot, ground rice, mustard, pepper, sago, tapioca, jam, ginger, chicory, sweets, iced cream, sugar, preserved green peas, various potted foods, rhubarb, sulphur, opium, iodide of potassium, sulphate of quinine, and milk of sulphur. It will thus be seen that not only have a large number of articles been collected and submitted to chemical investigation, but that the articles so examined have been of various natures, many of them requiring for their examination long and intricate processes of analysis. I have reason to believe that pains have been taken to have attention thus directed throughout the District to the quality of articles of food, drink, and drugs generally, and including those that are most liable to be adulterated. The number of cases in which adulteration has been detected, I am happy to say, is not great, and, as usual, these cases have been principally confined to milk, of which twenty-two samples were adulterated to a greater or lesser extent. There has also been one case of preserved green peas coloured with copper. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, 17, Bloomsbury Square, 23rd June, 1877. T. REDWOOD.
