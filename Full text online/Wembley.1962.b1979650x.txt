Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1962. This report has been compiled in the following five chapters, three with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services. Chapter I VITAL STATISTICS, Page 6, Statistical Appendix A, Pages 7—13. „ II GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES, Pages 14—17. „ III INFECTIOUS DISEASES, Pages 18—19, Statistical Appendix B, Pages 20—25. ,, IV ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE, FOOD AND WATER, HOUSING, FACTORIES, ETC., Pages 26—37, Statistical Appendix C, Pages 38—53. V ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 54. 5 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1962 was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 124,900. The census of April, 1961, reveals a figure of 124,892. 2. In 1962 there were recorded 1,742 live births, giving a crude birth rate of 13.9 per thousand estimated population. The RegistrarGeneral has provided boroughs with a comparability factor for this calculation which takes into account the relative proportion of women of child bearing age in the total community. When this factor of 1.02 is applied the standardised birth rate becomes 14.18, a more realistic figure, the origin of which, however, must be remembered when comparing it with past years. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 19.5 compares very favourably with the national rate of 20.7 per thousand and this is often used as a pointer to the adequacy of the services provided. This figure would have seemed quite unattainable a few years ago and indicates the advances in obstetrics and paediatrics which have become available in the district in recent years. 4. The number of deaths totalled 1,288, giving a crude death rate of 10.31 per thousand. The comparability factor when applied produces a standardised death rate of 11.86, again well below the national rate. 5. Cancer of the lung and bronchus continues to be by far the commonest site of fatal malignant disease. During the year there was a total of 69 deaths (60 male and 9 female) as compared with deaths from the same cause during the five preceding years:— Male. Female. Total. 1961 67 13 80 1960 57 12 69 1959 71 11 82 1958 58 7 65 1957 54 12 66 It is sad to see so many adolescents and school children persistently smoking in the face of all the evidence of the tie-up between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, and it is to be hoped that parents will do their utmost to discourage their offspring in this, not only by their good advice, but by their good example in not smoking themselves. 6 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the ares of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital is administered by the Mount Vernon Group, and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the West Hendon Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley Hospital. Arrangements are made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area. A list of hospitals is included :— Central Middlesex Hospital, Acton Lane, N.W.10. (ELGar 5733.) Edgware General Hospital, Edgware, Middlesex. (EDGware 2381.)

VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. No cases of infestation were discovered. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 5. MORTUARY. The Mortuary, situated at the rear of the Town Hall, received 195 bodies during the year. Reciprocal arrangements have been made with Harrow to cover absences of attendants due to holidays, sickness, etc. 17 CHAPTER III. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 1. SMALLPOX. Notification was received from the Minister of Health at the beginning of the year, of confirmed cases of Smallpox recendy arrived from Karachi, occurring in the London area, West Bromwich, Bradford and the Rhondda Valley. On January 17th the Health Department was notified of a local taxi driver who had driven the last mentioned case from London Airport to Birmingham on January 12th. He had returned home on January 13th, scrubbed the taxi out with Dettol, and driven another passenger from London Airport to Kings Cross on January 14th. On the 15 th and 16th he was at home getting over the reaction from vaccination on January 8th. The taxi was disinfected at the disinfecting station on the 17th and released again for service the next day; the members of the Health Staff concerned were vaccinated and the taxi driver's family kept under surveillance. No cases of Smallpox occurred. The County Medical Officer requested help at London Airport with the examination and vaccination of incoming passengers from the Far East, and one Assistant Medical Officer was sent on four days (January 18th, 19th, 22nd and 24th). The Minister of Health announced that there was no indication for mass vaccination, as there appeared to be no spread of the disease beyond the immediate contacts, and advised vaccination only for people whose work might expose them to infection, and to bona fide travellers. The " Wembley Observer " of January 18th carried a report from the Medical Officer of Health to this effect. Between March and June the Medical Officer's opinion was sought by general practitioners in respect of 5 patients who had developed rashes. These were duly visited and, though none turned out to be Smallpox, they were kept under 16-day surveillance. In one severe case visited during the Easter week-end, the second opinion of a Smallpox consultant was enlisted, pending the results of laboratory investigation. Early in April, the Secretary of the Wembley Football Club enquired whether it would be advisable for a team of 16 footballers 18 from Bridgend to visit Wembley during Easter for football matches and various social functions. All the men had been vaccinated and were at a distance of 50 miles from the affected area. He was advised that there was no objection to their coming but finally cancelled the arrangement on his own initiative, as he thought the Wembley residents would not like it. During the year a number of contacts were kept under surveillance by the Health Inspectors. In January one contact from Manchester was supervised. In February and March notification was received of 9 passengers arriving in Wembley from Karachi. All the addresses given were visited, but 6 people had removed elsewhere and the Medical Officers of Health of the new areas were informed. The rest were kept under surveillance. In August notification was received from the Minister, of 3 passengers bound for Wembley from S.S. Oronsay, on board which a case of Smallpox had occurred. These 3 plus 2 other passengers visiting Wembley for two days, were kept under surveillance. In October, 5 passengers from S.S. Orion carrying a case of Smallpox, came to Wembley and were also kept under surveillance. Apart from members of the Health Staff, some Ambulance men and policemen were vaccinated, as a precautionary measure. Various European countries made vaccination compulsory to visitors from this country during the summer, and altogether there were 19,879 vaccinations carried out, chiefly by general practitioners. 2. FOOD POISONING. The total of cases notified during the year was 8, but none of these was from outbreaks. It is certain that many sporadic cases occur which are not notified but equally probable that all major incidents are discovered and investigated. 3. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF IMMUNISATION. The Department continues to authenticate the International Certificates of Vaccination for travellers who have received inoculations from Wembley practitioners. During the year 8,225 certificates received attention in the Department. 19 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B. Monthly incidence of the Infectious Diseases. Disease. January February. March April. May. Jane.

When major events occur at the Stadium a substantial number of hawkers and street traders invariably attempt to pursue their calling in the neighbourhood of the Stadium, and the Department has felt for some time that those concerned with the vending of foodstuffs and ice cream should be subjected to strict control. During the year special visits were paid to the neighbourhood of the Stadium when important events were occurring, and a number of unsatisfactory traders were noted. On report to the Committee decisions were reached to prosecute, not only for failure to register as a hawker under the Middlesex County Council Act of 1950, but also under the Food Hygiene Regulations when appropriate. The effect of this is to secure a larger penalty in the event of a successful prosecution, and thereby to act as an increased deterrent to unsatisfactory hawkers of foodstuffs in the Borough. During the year two defendants were fined a total of £79 0s. Od. in respect of seventeen summonses, and the Council, in addition, were awarded fifteen guineas costs. One of the defendants was ordered to pay within twenty-eight days of the hearing or suffer the penalty of six months' imprisonment. No. of events 7 No. of traders inspected 39 2. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 : Section 3. A dual obligation is imposed upon any person who installs a new furnace in industrial premises or a new furnace of an output greater than 55,000 British Thermal Units per hour in domestic premises, (a) to install only such a furnace which is, so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of the type for which it was designed, and (b) to notify the local authority of his intention to install the furnace. 26 During the year the Health Department became aware, by notification or otherwise, of the installation of furnaces, which appear to meet the requirements of the section, in existing buildings as follows :— Oil-fired. Gas-fired Solid smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 12 2 — Commercial premises 6 5 — Dwellings 35 42 4 Other premises 2 — — The use of three unsatisfactory industrial incinerators was discontinued and one of an acceptable type was installed. Two existing industrial furnaces were converted to oil-burning. Furnaces proposed in new buildings were as follows :— Oil-fired. Gas-fired Solid smokeless fuel. Industrial premises 11 — — Commercial premises 13 — — Section 10. When the deposited plans for the erection or extension of a building other than a dwelling, shop or office, include the provision of a chimney, the local authority must be satisfied that the height of the chimney will be sufficient to disperse adequately any smoke, grit, dust or gases emitted from it. During the year agreement was reached in respect of suitable heights for twenty-four new chimneys. Section 11. Wembley No. 2 (Fryent) Smoke Control Order, 1961. Wembley No. 3 (Preston) Smoke Control Order, 1961. Wembley No. 4 (Claremont) Smoke Control Order, 1961. Wembley No. 5 (Woodcock Park) Smoke Control Order, 1961. Wembley No. 6 (Mount Stewart) Smoke Control Order, 1962. 27 The year under review saw the confirmation of the above Orders by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the coming into operation of the first four, so that a further three thousand seven hundred buildings occupying six hundred and ninety acres became subject to control. It is thought that, as a result, some eighteen hundred tons of raw coal will no longer be inefficiently burnt in open domestic fireplaces each year, and that some forty-five tons less smoke will be emitted at the comparatively low levels of house chimneys. In meeting claims for grant which were received for works of improvement to the heating arrangements at 964 houses in the areas, the net cost to the Council was £2,612 (including £915 spent on 336 Council-owned properties). Wembley No. 1 (Barn Hill) Smoke Control Order, 1960. The area covered by this Order has been under surveillance for fifteen months and no contraventions calling for formal action have been observed and the few emissions which have been investigated have proved to be the unavoidable slight smoke which arises when an authorised solid fuel is first ignited. There are known to be forty-seven oil-fired central heating boilers in houses in the area, and it is regrettable to have to record that in two instances complaints have been received of oily odours emanating from the boiler flues. The cause of these emissions is not yet understood but it is hoped that further investigation will enable the difficulty to be remedied. Future Smoke Control Areas. Wembley No. 7 (Northwick Park) Smoke Control Order. Wembley No. 8 (Chalkhill) Smoke Control Order. The above two Orders were submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1962 but confirmation had not been received by the end of the year. When Orders 6, 7 and 8 come into operation in 1963, there will remain some four thousand three hundred and fifty acres containing thirty-two thousand dwellings still to be covered, and the Council has decided that the future rate of progress should be such as to ensure that the whole of the Borough will be subject to Smoke Control Orders by 1973. 28 Section 24—Building Byelaw 115A. Appliances for heating and cooking installed in new buildings must, in general, be capable of burning smokeless fuel, although there is no obligation on the part of the occupier to do so until the area in which the building is situated becomes the subject of a smoke control order. The proper installation of suitable appliances in new houses at the time of erection has been particularly important during the past six years since any house built after 5th July, 1956, does not qualify for grant in case any works of adaptation to fireplaces become necessary to comply with a smoke control order. During the year, under the supervision of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Building Inspection Section, there were erected and equipped in accordance with the requirements of this byelaw :— Privately built dwellings 113 Council built dwellings 45 Section 25—Measurement of atmospheric pollution. For nine years, from 1952 to 1961, the deposit of soot and grit at a site in the Exhibition Grounds was collected in a standard gauge and analysed monthly. The gauge had the primary purpose of monitoring the fall-out from the Neasden Power Station, and was one of a group initiated by the neighbouring authority, Willesden, where a number of gauges were in use over the same period in the vicinity of the several generating stations in that district. The undissolved solids collected by this gauge showed a most satisfactory trend during the years of its exposure, the average monthly amounts being as follows :— 1952 Water-insoluble matter expressed as 591 grammes per 100 square metres 1953 ditto. 526 1954 ditto. 375 1955 ditto. 432 1956 ditto. 395 1957 ditto. 386 1958 ditto. 360 1959 ditto. 361 1960 ditto. 299 29 As will be seen, there was a steady decline in the particulate matter deposited at this site amounting in the nine years to an overall reduction of some 49 per cent. This improvement can undoubtedly be related to the action taken at the Neasden Power Station where six pulverised fuel furnaces in existence at the commencement of the survey had by 1956 been converted to fuel oil burning, and it must not be overlooked that in the Exhibtion Grounds generally, an unknown number of steam raising and low pressure hot water boilers were also converted during this time. At the end of the year there were :— 70 oil burning boilers. 13 gas-fired boilers. 28 coke-fired boilers. 4 coal-fired boilers. 1 wood burning boiler. It is interesting to compare this result with the findings of the Warren Spring Laboratory that from 1952—1959 the emission of smoke over the country as a whole was reduced by 17 per cent., and in London from 1953—1959 by 46 per cent. In March, 1962, the Council resolved, at the invitation of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to participate in the National Survey of Atmospheric Pollution, which, by a three to fiveyear nation-wide investigation, seeks to establish a normal background pollution level of smoke and sulphur dioxide in districts of similar character. Daily recordings commenced at four stations, Wembley County School, Claremont County School, Kingsbury County School, and the G.E.C. Research Laboratory, Exhibition Grounds, on November 1st. The instruments have not yet been in use long enough for any general conclusion to be drawn as to differences in pollution levels in the various parts of the town or the effects of the Smoke Control Orders, but were operating in time to record the notable upsurge in smoke and sulphur content of the air during the foggy period of early December. At the time of the fog the minimum temperatures recorded in the grounds of the Town Hall were the lowest for any three consecutive days in November or December (although very much lower temperatures were to be reached later in the winter) and almost all the products of combustion at this time of heavy fuel 30 consumption must have been trapped below the inversion layer which is reported to have been some three hundred feet above ground level. Certainly no domestic flue gases would have penetrated this layer, and few, if any, of the local industrial chimneys can have been high enough to have had much better effect. In the week ending 8th December, the highest reading of atmospheric smoke was approximately eleven times greater, and sulphur dioxide seven-and-a-half times greater than the average for the month. The full effect of this on the health of the community is not reducible to statistics but it may be observed that in the week following the fog the deaths in which bronchitis was a factor suffered a threefold increase. 3. THE PETROLEUM REGULATION ACTS. (1) With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, plans deposited for planning consent or approval under the building byelaws, which show that car parking spaces are to be provided in a building, are examined in this Department. A licence is necessary when there is likely to be an aggregate of more than sixty gallons of petroleum-spirit kept in the fuel tanks of motor vehicles, and in granting a licence the Council imposes the conditions recommended by the Home Office. Where less than sixty gallons is to be kept in this manner the premises must comply with conditions set out in the Petroleum-Spirit (Motor Vehicles, etc.) Regulations, 1929. During the year there were examined three proposals which came within the scope of the Regulations and six to which licensing conditions were applicable. In each case revision of the plans was necessary in order to meet the standard requirements but none of the buildings had been completed by the end of 1962. With the shortage of land in the Borough, and the imposition of town planning requirements as to the provision of car parking spaces for new buildings, it may be anticipated that the control of garages incorporated in buildings will occupy more and more of the attention of the Department. (2) Ullage tests on 32 underground petrol tanks over twenty years old, and totalling 18,700 gallons capacity, were made, and one 31 500-gallon tank was tested with nitrogen under pressure. As a result, three 500-gallon tanks were taken out of use, and the pipe connection to another made good. (3) Eight new tanks of a total capacity of 10,500 gallons were installed during the year and tested to the satisfaction of the Inspectors, and the number of new pumps of approved pattern installed was five. One 1,000-gallon tank was brought back into use after being subjected to a pressure test. (4) Two unlicensed and newly established petroleum-mixture stores were discovered. The keeping of the substance was stopped until the stores were made to comply with the Council's requirements. (5) Number of premises licensed to store petroleum- spirit or mixtures 149 Aggregate amount of petroleum-spirit and mixtures stored under licence (in gallons) 362,250 Number of visits of inspection made to premises 379 Amount of fees received (Based on the scale confirmed in 1928) £131 4. HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION. The immigration of Commonwealth subjects into this country in the late fifties provided a welcome reinforcement to available labour but placed an additional and severe burden on the housing accommodation in big cities already falling short of the needs of the indigenous population. The situation in respect of the multiple occupation of houses in Wembley, however, has by no means reached a point at which control should give rise to serious difficulty. Details of all cases of which the Department becomes aware are firstly referred to the Town Planning Section of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, in order that consideration may be given to the grant of planning permission, if necessary. Where permission is granted, or the user of the premises is sufficiendy long established not to require permission, action is recommended under the Housing Act, 1961, sections 15 and/or 19 to secure the provision of appropriate amenities for the occupiers in accordance with the following standards adopted by the Council in May, 1962. 32 (1) Natural and artificial lighting and ventilation. (a) Natural lighting and ventilation shall be secured in every bedroom, living room and kitchen by the provision of a window or windows in accordance with the requirements of the current Building Byelaws relating to habitable rooms; and the height of rooms to be so used shall be in accordance with the Building Byelaws. (b) In any watercloset apartment used in common there shall be, in addition to a window conforming to the above requirements, permanent means of ventilation. (c) Artificial lighting shall be provided in the form of electric lights so as to give a degree of illumination at table top level equal to two-and-a-half foot candles in bedrooms, five foot candles in living rooms and eight foot candles in kitchens. (d) Any staircase used in common, and any passage or landing connected therewith shall be provided with adequate means of electric lighting. (2) Personal washing facilities. (a) For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be a fixed bath or shower, in a separate bathroom, with adequate supplies of running hot and cold water and proper drainage, and (b) For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be provided a wash hand basin with running hot and cold water and proper drainage. (3) Drainage and sanitary conveniences. For every eight persons including children over the age of one year there shall be provided one watercloset. (4) Water supply and facilities for the storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water. In respect of each separate letting, there shall be provided, suitable means of cooking and storing food, and a sink with proper 33 drainage and a supply of running hot water and mains water, for the exclusive use of each tenant or household. Where, however, there is a common kitchen provided on each storey on which there are rooms separately occupied, there need only be one sink in that kitchen for common use. (5) Installations for space heating or for the use of space heating appliances. Rooms used as living rooms or bed-sitting rooms shall have installed either— (a) an open fire in good repair and suitable fuel storage accommodation, or (b) a fixed gas-fire with an adequate flue, or (c) a fixed electric fire or a power point for use with a portable electric space heating appliance. At the end of the first year of operating the Act of 1961, the position was as follows :— Houses inspected 24 Found not to be in multiple occupation 6 Found to be in multiple occupation but conforming to Council's standard 3 Ceased to be so occupied after informal approach Made to conform to Council's standard after informal approach 2 Planning Permission still under consideration 6 5. COURT PROCEEDINGS. Apart from the two cases taken against hawkers, which have already been mentioned, it was unfortunately found necessary to proceed in the magistrates' courts on another nine occasions. Three cases for dirty bottles of milk resulted in total fines of £20 0s. Od. with £13 13s. Od. costs. 34 One case of a mouldy loaf of bread resulted in a fine of £10 0s. Od. and £5 5s. Od. costs. One case of a manfactured meat product containing glass fragments resulted in a fine of £30 0s. Od. and £10 10s. Od. costs. A Nuisance Order made in respect of a leaking roof included an award to the Council of £10 10s. Od. costs. Failure to comply with a Nuisance Order to abate noise resulted in three successive convictions with total penalties of £91 0s. Od. and total costs awarded of £68 5s. Od. 6. PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. Two open-air public swimming baths are provided in the area and serve the general public during the summer period, usually from May to September. The Vale Farm Pool is 55 yards long and 25 yards wide with a maximum depth of 9 feet and has a capacity of 400,000 gallons of water which is obtained from the Colne Valley water supply. The Pool is constructed of mass concrete and lined with glazed bricks The water is filtered through Candy Pressure Filters and has a complete change every 4} hours, the circulation being effected by 20 h.p pump with a stand-by 15 h.p. pump. " Breakpoint" chlorination is effected and an average consumption of approximately 3 lbs. per hour of chlorine. The water is then neutralised by the addition of soda which gives an approximate pH factor of 7.5 which indicates slight alkalinity. The bathing load is approximately 1,500 and the basket room system of changing is in operation with cubicles surrounding the Pool. A Cafe is provided for refreshments and the catering let out to a Caterer on an annual basis. The Kingsbury Pool is situated in Roe Green Park in the Kingsbury Road and has a length of 55 yards and a width of 25 yards with a maximum depth of 10 feet. The capacity is 464,000 gallons but in this case there is a foot trough surrounding the Pool and also a Children's paddling pool. The water is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and is circulated through Permutit Pressure Filters and pumped by means of two 15 h.p. pumps and a complete change of water is effected every five hours. Chlorination is again on the breakpoint" system and the same dosage and neutralisation arrangements. The Pool at Kingsbury is constructed of reinforced 35 concrete and again is lined with glazed bricks. The capacity of this Pool for bathing is approximately 2,000, but there is a greater spectator area here than at Vale Farm. The basket room system is again in operation but in this case the changing accommodation cubicles are under the terraced seating. A Cafe is also provided at this Pool and catering is carried out by outside Caterers. Samples of the water taken from the Pools and subjected to bacteriological examination, revealed the absence of B. Coli in all samples and proved the quality of the water to be beyond reproach. 7. SEWERAGE. The growth of the population in Wembley and the increase in domestic and other premises, was very considerable during the years 1930/1960, and the intervention of a period when few works could be undertaken on account of wartime conditions resulted in the Borough being behind-hand in the provision of adequate drainage, both for the surface water and for soil sewage. The Council were very conscious of this difficulty and an extensive programme of sewerage construction received their approval. 36 gramme of sewerage construction received their approval. Details of the relief schemes are included. Name. Type. Estimated Expenditure. Remarks. l. Wealdstone Brook Improvement. (M.C.C. Sch Surface Water, eme). £20,000 (Wembley B.C. Contribution 1960-61).

RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service which is confined to dealing with infestations by rats and mice has continued to operate during the year under review. A staff of three " Ministry trained" assistants has performed the necessary work. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. 883 premises were satisfactorily treated by the Council and one infestation was known to have been treated privately. 9. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The Officer of Public Cleansing has kindly supplied the following information :— Refuse Collection. House and Trade refuse is collected weekly, with the exception that refuse from certain blocks of flats is collected twice weekly. The amount of refuse collected during the year was 31,343 tons. The separate collection of waste paper from business premises has been maintained. The amount collected from this source during the year was 759 tons. Refuse Disposal. Refuse is disposed of by a Separation and Incineration Plant which has handled 31,348 tons. Salvage materials amounting to 3,242 tons were sold for £18,635. Street Cleansing. The system of street sweeping by the use of pedestrian controlled electric trucks, each with an operator and four street orderlies, continues to give a frequency of sweeping of at least once every seven days. Public Conveniences. Free washing facilities at the two staffed Conveniences in the Borough have been maintained during the year. 37 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

During the year your Medical Officers acted professionally foi the Council in performing 46 clinical examinations of actual or prospective staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This helps in securing a medically sound personnel for all the activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual incidence of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency difficult without such a service. During the year the establishment of the Department has remained near full complement and each member of the staff has consequently been able to settle down to his appointed duties. The burden of work continues to be substantial and, if anything, is increasing on account of current legislation. It affords me great satisfaction, therefore, to report my considerable appreciation of the loyal and enthusiastic endeavours of the whole of the staff during the year under review. Finally, I should like to express my gratitude and thanks to all members of the Council, particularly those members of the Health Committee, who have taken interest in the work of the Department and assisted our endeavours towards a healthy Borough. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and GentlemenYour obedient servant, E.
