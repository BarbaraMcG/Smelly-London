To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The basis of all calculations as to death rates is the number of the resident population, which was shown at the last census year to be considerably in error, for all England, London, and most of the districts of inner London, as regards the estimated population during 1881-90. The great comparative increase in the population of London over the rest of England has been for the first time diminished, as the London increase was at a "somewhat lower rate than the rest of England and Wales" during this period of 1881-90. This shows better hope for the future that the overcrowding of certain cities will not in future occur in so great a ratio, and that increased mortality and sickness from that cause— overcrowding—will diminish. At the same time the smaller proportion of country people in the prime of life entering cities will tend to increase the proportionate number of urban deaths. The population of Hackney has increased in the ten years from 186,462 to 229,531, and of inhabited houses, from 27,476, to 33,187. The increase of population was not, however, equal to that in former periods, as in 1861-71 it was 50.0 per cent., in 1871-81, 49.2 per cent., and in 1881-90 only 23.l per cent. I had not 6 calculated to population when increased in the same ratio as in 1871-81, otherwise my death rates would have been wrong to a very considerable extent. The populations in the sub-districts were returned as follows:— Stoke Newington, 30,925, against 22,781 in 1881; Stamford Hill, 17,759, against 9,277 in 1881; West Hackney, 42,602, against 37,610 in 1881; Hackney, 96,486, against 76,911 in 1881; and South Hackney, 41,759, against 39,883 in 1881. It will be seen that the increase in the different sub-registration districts was very unequal, and must continue to be so, as the new ground to be covered in places is very different in various parts of the parish. The number of inhabited houses has increased since 1881, as in Stoke Newington they were 3,522, and in 1891, 4,765. The excess in Stamford Hill was proportionately larger still, as it was 3,176 in 1891, against 1,508 in 1881. In West Hackney room was found for 520, the figures in 1881 having been 5,529, against 6,049. The greatest proportionate increase occurred in Hackney, there being now 13,295 houses in Hackney sub-division, against 11,146. In South Hackney the number of new houses was not so large, as there were only 5,902 against 5,751 in 1881. Not only has the number of new houses increased, but the number of inhabitants per house has increased, which certainly tends to show that in outlying London new buildings become occupied and old buildings closed, so that the process of what we may call exclusion, will gradually lead to the survival of the fittest, and the closing of the old, unfit, dirty houses, will continue to act as it has done for years past. Public Health Act.—It is commonly supposed that the Public Health Act, which passed this year, and made a great improvement in the sanitary law of London, repealing useless sections in other Acts, as well as considerable additions, embraces all the sanitary law by which London is governed. This is a mistake, as a large number of Acts were not repealed, which is to be regretted, as some will almost certainly fall into abeyance. It did not contain so many additions as were expected, and the most important referred to the cleansing and removal of snow, refuse and dust, by 7 which a considerable increased expenditure has been cast upon the Metropolitan local authorities. The chief increased expenditure will be the removal of snow, as the provisions for the removal of Just and ashes from houses, although the penalties are stringent, yet there will be, except in very bad weather, little extra cost incurred bv neglect to carry out the provisions. There are sections against manufacturers, slaughterhouse keepers, and others allowing the drainage from their works or from manure running over an open space or footpath, and also increased powers to inspectors of nuisances as regards the removal of "manure, dung, soil, filth or other matter which ought to be removed." These powers give increased facility for the removal, but in so doing considerable extra cost may be involved. Bye-laws may be made by the London County Council as regards various matters, which, with the general alterations in the Act, including the pressing obligation of a regular and systematic examination of all the houses in the district, will render the appointment of additional inspectors of nuisances absolutely necessary. For instance, the increased supervision required to carry out the Act as regards workshops and smoke nuisances would take up the entire time of one inspector. The provisions now in force for compelling the supply of water to houses and to the water-closets therein, have been much extended, and will doubtless meet numerous cases where great difficulty is now experienced. The extent of the benefits conferred will, however, depend to a great extent on the bye-laws to be made. Many of the additions and alterations will be referred to later, suffice it now to say that considerable alterations and improvements have been made in the legal procedure necessary to obtain the abatement of nuisances, but no summonses can be taken out except on order from the sanitary authority. Diphtheria outbreak at Clapton.—The causation of diphtheria seems as little known now as years ago. During the whole time I have been Medical Officer of Health for Hackney, I have devoted especial attention to the subject and arrived at certain conclusions. One is that it spreads from person to person, and perhaps through 8 the air and fossites, although these hitter have not been conclusively shown. One of the chief causes of spread is by means of large schools, such as Board schools. There have been several instances of this, and one very notably in connection with the Rushmore Road schools, where a considerable number of children were attacked in the infant school, and not in any of the others. From what I had observed previously, I requested the playground of these children to be closed, but as that could not very well be done, the infants were sent home without mixing with the other children. In rather less than a fortnight the disease ceased, not only in the schools, but in the district. As to sewerage I have but little satisfactory evidence that bad drainage has had any direct connection with the causation of diphtheria. Outbreaks have occurred in connection with disturbance of soil and even opening of sewers, but they are so few when compared with openings of bad ground, and even of what has been termed germ-laden soil, that the evidence is of little value. At the International Congress of Hygiene this year, Dr. Seaton opened the discussion, which was continued by delegates from all parts of the world, with a resolution proposed by him and seconded by myself, that a comprehensive and systematic enquiry should be made by the British Government into the causes of diphtheria, including in such inquiry the places known to be free from the disease, and taking into consideration the results of previous investigations as to the carriage of infection by milk, its relation to dirt, dampness, and insanitary surroundings. The facts contained in the papers and the discussions were insufficient to settle one point. As regards Hackney, many local outbreaks have occurred iu connection with imported cases. There was one important table exhibited showing that in localities where sanitary works had been carried out for years and typhoid fever had diminished, that diphtheria had increased its death rate. This certainly indicates that diphtheria must be combatted with other weapons than those in use for typhoid. In April, 1888, there was a much more extensive outbreak of this disease near Southwold Road and Detmold Road Board school. The first deaths were returned as "cynanche maligna," but which the medical attendant, 9 more careful, told me was almost certainly diphtheria. A few days afterwards, other deaths occurred in Inver Road, Aveley Road, and Stone's Buildings. Unfortunately, just after the outbreak, a house drain was opened in the Inver Road, so that the spread of the disease might have been affected by it. Many of the cases occurred, and some died nearly a week before the opening of the drain. The measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease were to prevent children attending the school from infected houses, and have all children sent home without entering the playground. The effects of these measures were very marked without closing the school. Outbreaks of sore throat spreading through the houses are by no means rare, but they seem to spread in the same way as diphtheria, viz., personal contact, so that the same precautions as regards isolation obtain in each case. Typhoid Fever.—On July 27th I received certificates that five cases of typhoid fever had occurred in one street in Dalston, and one in an adjoining street; on the 28th, of three cases in one house in another street; and on the 29th, of three more cases in an adjoining street. On making personal enquiry I found that fen of the twelve children had been on excursions on July 7th and 9th to the Forest. I went to the places where they had tea, and ascertained that the water supply was good, that a very large number of other children had been there on the same day, and that no general outbreak had occurred. Also that there was not any typhoid anywhere in the tea-gardens. I then obtained lists of the houses supplied by the milkman who sold most of the milk in the street, and ascertained that numerous other persons were supplied by him out of the same can, who did not suffer. I was unable, therefore, to decide as to the cause of the outbreak, especially as there were other instances of outbreaks in other streets, where the children were affected at the same time, and who did not go on excursions. A few more cases occurred subsequently in these streets which were evidently from infection by those first attacked. 10 The whole of the cases were strictly isolated or taken to the hospital, otherwise the outbreak would have been very serious. A more careful enquiry elicited the fact that one of the children was ill on the day of the excursion, and on arrival at the tea-gardens was wrapped and laid on a sofa. Four or five days afterwards this child sickened with obscure symptoms of typhoid, although the medical attendant would not certify that it was typhoid. I think this fully explains the outbreak. Having now briefly discussed the alterations in death rates owing to population having been calculated at too high a number, I propose, after making calculations for past years, to discuss the rates for the year 1890.

The population of the district on July 1st was 230,379, which, as I said before, forms the basis of percentages. The numbers in the different districts and parishes were so different to those expected, as to show the necessity for at least a quinquennial census of all large cities and towns, but even then a large source of error would remain, as the rate of increase in the first five years might be much larger in the first than in the second, as occurred in our district, so that an equal course of population for the ten years would have been wrong. The births and marriages have varied considerably, the number of registered births in 1891 having been 6,960, against 6,674 in 1890, and 6,511 in 1889. The total number of deaths for all London was 90,216 in the year. The number of inhabited houses, as previously mentioned, has increased, as well as of the inhabitants living therein, but the difference is not very large, being only 0.14 per house, or 14 per 100 houses. 12 TABLE 11.

The birth rate has been decreasing all over England, and in France is assuming an important factor in the well-being of the country. As the death rate was only 17.8 per 1,000 population, to 30.5 birth rate, it is quite clear there is a considerable excess of population over deaths. The crude numbers were 7,126 births to 4,110 deaths, or an excess of 3,016 births over deaths. As usual, Hackney stands very favourably in the list of deaths of young children under one year, to total registered births, viz., 134, against for all London. This is very satisfactory to the domestic, sanitary, and general arrangements of the smaller houses in the district. 13 TABLE III.

The table shows that the number of deaths from the ordinary infectious diseases varied very little from that of the preceding year, as there were 689 against 685, although there were 156 deaths from influenza, against 31 in 1890. This will be referred to specially when the rate and progress of different diseases are considered. Tubercular diseases exacted a larger toll than usual, whilst wasting and convulsive diseases of infants under one year were about the same. The deaths per 1,000 population per annum varied between 7.76 in 1889, and 10.42 in 1891, chiefly from influenza. 14 TABLE IV.

NOTE.— Previously to 1885 all kinds of continued Fever were grouped together as "Fevers." 15 I have for the sake of comparison kept the infectious diseases to the same list as in previous reports, for uniformity's sake, but would point out that influenza, for many years a small factor in our death rate, assumed a very important position in 1891, having caused, next to whooping cough, the largest mortality of any. Small pox seems to have quite disappeared, but I fear not for long, whilst scarlet fever has decreased to a considerable extent, viz., to 28, against an average of 58. In spite of the outbreaks of diphtheria and typhoid already mentioned, the number of deaths was very slightly increased, whilst diarrhoea had decreased. There was one death from typhus reported, which had only been three days in the district when attacked, lived in a healthy, roomy house, and certainly was not contracted here. The most important sanitary event of the year was the severe epidemic of influenza, which caused 141 deaths, against 31 in 1890. There were some stray cases in the early part of the year, but no deaths until April, when two deaths were registered during the week ending April 25th. In the following week this number was increased to 6, then to 15 in the week ending May 9th; to 13 in the week ending the 16th; to 32 in the week ending May 23rd, which was the largest number recorded for the year. The deaths then decreased to 20 on the 30th; 12 on the 6th June; 11 on the 13th; 10 on the 20th, and 6 on the 27th June. After this there were not more than 3 deaths recorded in any one week, and that was for the 2nd of January, 1892. The causation of influenza, or the influences which lead the disease to fall on one part of the body rather than another, that is to say, why it should cause chest affection in some, head disease in others, is not known. I think it is highly infectious, spreading as a rule from person to person, rather than through the atmosphere. Although a very old disease, very little is known about it in former years. This, however, is not the place to discuss the etiology of influenza, and I therefore give a table of the deaths in the different weeks of the year since April last. 16 Deaths from Influenza during the year 1891. 25th April 2 2nd May 6 9th „ 15 16th „ 13 23rd „ 32 30th „ 20 6th June 12 13th „ 11 20th June 10 27th „ 6 4th July 2 11th „ 2 25th „ 2 15th August 2 29th „ 1 5th September 1 26th September 1 31st October 1 28th November 1 5th December 1 2nd January 3 144 I have often been asked by members as to the relative frequency of various infectious diseases. I thought that a table, shewing the number of cases removed to the Asylums Board in every month would not only afford this, but shew when each disease had reached its culminating point in the year. In Hackney, scarlet fever was very prevalent in November, far more so than in any other parish, the next in order of frequency being Bethnal Green. Indeed, allowing for difference in population, the number for scarlet fever was greatest in Bethnal Green. The greatest number of cases occurred in November in Hackney, in October in Islington, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green, and January in Poplar. Diphtheria was most prevalent in Hackney in October and November; in Islington in September and October; in Shoreditch in January, October and November; in Bethnal Green in February and August; in Poplar in October. Typhoid was most prevalent in Hackney during August, owing to a rather extensive outbreak in Dalston in that month; in Islington in October; in Shoreditch in September; in Bethnal Green and Poplar in October. The figures shew that enteric (typhoid) not only is so markedly prevalent in any one month, but that a small outbreak makes itself known immediately by increasing the mortality above the average. 17 Cases of infectious diseases removed from Hackney, Islington, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, and Poplar, to the Asylums' Board Hospitals during 1891.

Of diphtheria, 386 were removed from Hackney; 469 from Islington; 230 from Shoreditch; 279 from Bethnal Green; and 441 from Poplar. Of typhoid, the largest number was removed from Hackney, viz., 244; then 179 from Islington; 112 from Shoreditch; 145 from Bethnal Green; and 183 from Poplar. These figures show that Hackney in 1891 did not suffer more, as is often asserted, from infectious diseases, than the adjoining parishes. 18 The Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889, has given a large amount of additional work, not only in visiting and disinfecting the premises where the diseases have occurred but also in making out the daily lists for the Asylums' Board containing copies on their forms of all the Certificates received. These copies state the diseases and where they occurred, the age of the patient, the sex, and whether treated as a public or private patient. These lists contain an account for each day, and so necessitate speedy action by the staff. It will be seen that the number of certificates received during the year was 1,510, but that only 178 notifications by the friends had been sent, although they should have been nearly as numerous as the certificates. By extras, are where several cases occurred in one house.

I am able, therefore, now to present an 20 accurate record of all the deaths of our parishioners within greater London. This year the census has been taken, so that the numerical calculations are correct. It will be seen that the percentages of deaths to total deaths amongst children under 1 year old has varied but 4½ per cent., that for 1891 having about an average, viz., 23.0. The deaths between 1 and 5, and between 5 and 15, were also smaller than usual, so that for children under 15 the number of deaths was small, and the average remains fairly constant until about 60 years was reached, when a sudden jump occurred. On referring to the ages at death from influenza, the matter is explained by no less than 64 having been registered in the age period 55—75. For further details I must refer to that part of the report dealing with influenza. This table is of considerable value, by leading to an examination of the deaths at different ages whenever this table shews an undue proportion of deaths at certain ages. The greater proportion of deaths under 15 years as compared with total deaths, show that injurious home influences are not so largely concerned in the production of deaths at these ages as formerly. Probably attendance in large and well-ventilated school rooms—I mean well ventilated as compared with their homes—the better sanitary conditions in and around the houses must also be considered. 21 TABLE VI.

Doubtless there has been an increase in the number of houses built, and therefore of families in them, as compared with other sub-districts. The total number of births registered in the district was 7,126, against 6,730 in 1890— very decided, especially when it is considered that there were 53 weeks included in the Registrar's year. All my statistics are made up for the calendar year, except as regards the births, for which I cannot obtain the necessary statistics. 22 The mean percentages of the births in the 10 years 1881-90, as compared with 1891, show nearly the same average,—for Stoke Newington, 12.0; a larger for Stamford Hill, viz , 6.1 against 4.9; much smaller for West Hackney, viz., 17.4 against 20.2; no less than 45.5 against 41.2 in Hackney sub district, which has increased so considerably in population in the 10 years. In South Hackney there has been a decrease to a moderate amouut, but the total number of births has increased since 1881. TABLE VII. Deaths in each Sub-District, 1882-91. Year.

There is also the Mortuary there, so that persons brought there and unclaimed are entered to Hackney. I have endeavoured to put this right, but have only succeeded to a certain extent, by ascertaining as far as possible the places of residence of those who have died in those institutions, and assigned them to their proper sub-districts. The 23 accidents outside Hackney were not included in the above figures. The number of deaths in Stoke Newington was 5 below the number for 1890, viz., 440; for Stamford Hill much below, having been 235 only; but it must be noticed that the total number registered was more than 100 below that for 1890, and consequently the number for all the sub-districts is smaller than before.

There have not been so many applications as in previous years, and the whole of these disinfections have been done in consequence of deaths, or of certificates from the medical attendants of the families infected. It will be seen that the number of houses and articles therein is much in excess of those done before 1890, when the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act was passed, yet in 1891 there were fewer requests made. At present the disinfecting apparatus, which evolves dry heat, and is in fact an oven, is altogether behind the requirements of the district if an epidemic of scarlet fever, diphtheria, or small pox should break out. It is universally admitted now that the quickest 24 and most efficient is moist heat, and certainly the Board should have one of these placed in a more central part of the district, with a properly devised and prepared place for keeping the infected quite distinct from the disinfected articles. I do not mean to say that these may get mixed, yet as there are not two sides to the chamber it is possible to happen. I have repeatedly mentioned this, but as the present apparatus is sufficient for the disinfection of all the infected clothes we were required to treat, I have not pressed the matter on the attention of the Board in the way I should otherwise have done.

The mean temperature was 47.9 deg. The total rainfall, 25.83 inches, which fell on 176 days. In January it was very dry and cold, with frequent fog and snow, and a very large death rate at those periods when snow and fog prevailed. The temperature was 15 to 18 deg , on some days below the average. In February, which was dry and foggy at times, there was a little snow, but altogether only a little rain. March at first was pleasant, and then became cold and stormy. The snow was heavy at times and blocked several lines. The mean temperature for January was 34.3 deg., of February 38.5 deg., and of March 40.4 deg. April was dry and cold throughout, as the temperature was below the average on almost every day. May was changeable, generally cold and unseasonable, the temperature was below the average until the 10th, when wanner weather set in, but on the 13th a frost occurred nearly all over England, and the day temperature did not rise to 56 deg. There was also a gale of snow on the 15th to 18th in many parts of the country. In London the mean temperature was below the average for nearly six weeks, viz., from April 1st to May 6th. it then became warmer, then cold, especially from the 16th to the 25th, when the deficiency on the average was nearly 12 deg. During the remainder of May and in June it was mostly cold. The mean temperature of May was 503 deg., which was the lowest for 120 years. The mean temperature for April, May and June was 44.2, 50.3 and 60.4 deg. The rain for the quarter was 4.37 inches, which was nearly 1½ inches below the average. In July and August dull, cold and unsettled weather prevailed as in the former mouths no approach to that of an ordinary, but in September fine, when the average temperature was 2½ above the average in July and August, it having been 1.4 deg., in the latter month 2.3 deg. From the summary of the weather it was evident 26 that in July it was cold, dull, and unsettled, with a great want of sunshine, so that on 5 days only was it pleasant and summerlike. In August similar weather prevailed to that in July, so that the crops were kept back and damaged by a heavy storm on the 25th. The rainfall was heavy and frequent, as the total in the two months amounted to 7.11, which was more than 2 inches in excess of the average. In September the weather was fine from the 7th, with much sunshine, so that the temperature was more than 6 deg. in excess of several days, but the cool nights kept the mean temperature for the month more than 1 deg. below that of July. October was mild and wet, the rainfall having reached the large amount of 4.32 inches, which was more than 1½ inches in excess. The mean temperature in London was generally below the average up to November 10th, when it became higher, but for the next few days it became warmer until on the 19th, which was quite a summer-like day, it was 11.2 deg. above the mean. It was then cold for a few days, then became warm again, with changes from warmth to cold up to the end of the year. The mean resultant was 1.2 deg. for October ; 0.4 for November ; and 1.5 for December. The rain was nearly 2 inches in excess, having reached 9.84 inches. As regards mortality and number of deaths, there did not seem to be any decided relation, as the departures from ordinary temperatures were not very large, and the fogs were not accompanied by extreme cold. Dust Collection.—The collection of dust and other home refuse during the year 1891 has been a source of great anxiety to those having its superintendence. During the first quarter of the year, when the old Contractors carried out the work, the dust was removed regularly according to notice and without friction, but when a new Contractor was appointed to B and C Divisions at lower prices the trouble began. Mr. Potter, the newly appointed Contractor, and subsequently his sureties, tried to remove the dust 27 at the contract prices, but they both failed, as they found them utterly unremunerative. The contract for the B Division made on March 25th for three years, was at the low rate of 2s. lid. per load, which included assistance in removing the dust, providing a driver, cart or van, horse, harness, ladders, baskets, &c., and what is now a very onerous duty, that of providing a shoot. Now as the average is only a little more than four loads for each cart, it is evident that the amount payable would not defray the cost. Since, wages have risen, and the Contractor required assistance in June and August, utterly breaking down in September. His sureties then took up the contract, but lost so largely, that on the 12th December they finally gave it up, and fresh contracts at very highly increased rates were entered into for two years. This, however, will form part of next year's report. The total number of loads removed in the year for this Division was 11,424, against 11,924 for 1890. This decrease was small and below the average, so that it is evident that a rather large accumulation had been allowed to take place. As regards Division C, the same thing occurred—the price 2s. 5½d. was much too low, and the new Contractor broke down at the same time, and became bankrupt on 27th August. The sureties then undertook the work until December 12th, when they gave it up. The assistance by other Contractors reached the rather large sum of £115 6s. 0d. for the C Division, and £97 17s. 8d. for the B Division, which, with the difference in cost for the future, will make a very large item. The total number of loads removed in this Division was 12,029 at a cost of £1,530 7s. 4d., against 12,071 in 1890. As regards the A Division little has to be said, as the contracts were carried out by one firm, Messrs. Abbott, during the whole year the price being 2s. 11½d. for the last part. The work was well and systematically done, and carts and horses were supplied to enable the Board to carry out the dusting when the plant furnished by Mr. Potter and his sureties were not large enough. 28 Soil Pipes.—I have bestowed a considerable amount of time and attention on the subject of iron soil and ventilating pipes inside bouses. I have objected very strongly to them and done my best to get them placed outside. I do not mean to say that no kind of iron pipes should be placed inside houses, as wrought iron with proper leaded joints or with flanges properly constructed and put together are very good, as they are usually coated inside with Angus Smith cement, and not attacked by sewer gas. Ordinary cast-iron pipes, which are very frequently put in an angle in the house and covered with mortar, cannot be examined without pulling the interior wall to pieces, and even if put in a wooden box are necessarily defaced by an examination. We have met with several instances of defective iron soil pipes in houses where diphtheria occurred. In one, the smells were noticed at the top of the house where there was a water-closet, and, on examining the connection of the trap with the pipe, a small hole and defective joint were found. In another case, sewage dripped into a pantry, tainting the food, which, on examination, came from a cracked and shrunken joint in an iron pipe. In objecting to iron pipes inside houses, I carry my objection to pipes of any kind of material, even although they may not be ordinarily subject to erosion, as we have specimens of lead corroded in several parts by sewer gas. There is something in some specimens of lead which render them even unfit for being soil pipes inside houses. These remarks apply equally to ventilating pipes, which are, usually, continuations of soil pipes. Leaden soil pipes are also subject to be attacked by rats, several examples of which I have seen. Sanitary Work.—The inspection of workshops and factories has required a much larger amount of time and trouble than heretofore, and will increase year by year, as the tendency of legislation has been to throw more work on the sanitary staff of the Local Boards than ever. I, with Mr. Sortwell, visited a considerable number, and found all in a defective sanitary state. They were mostly dirty, overcrowded, ill-ventilated, and badly provided with water closet accommodation. Mr. Sortwell had a great deal of 29 difficulty in obtaining the removal, not only of the nuisances found in these warehouses and workshops, but, also, in others which he inspected. There ought to be a systematic inspection of all these places, which can only be done by appointing an inspector for the purpose. All those complained of were inspected and the nuisances found abated. There have been greatly increased duties placed on the sanitary staff by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, which have not been and cannot be met by the present inspectors, so that they must remain unattended to. I have pressed on the Sanitary Committee and the Board the necessity for an additional number of inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, (Signed) JOHN W.
