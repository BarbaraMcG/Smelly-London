March, 1946. To the Mayor, Alderman and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am submitting my twenty-third Annual Report concerning the health of the district of Surbiton during the year 1944. I regret the delay in producing this Report; the chief cause has been the shortage of staff and the absence of the Chief Sanitary Inspector owing to ill health. On studying the following figures, the health of the residents of Surbiton is, in my opinion, still satisfactory in spite of the acute shortage of housing accomimodation. I wish to thank all the members of my Staff for their assistance during the past year. STATISTICS.

This is no doubt due to the protection afforded to the children by immunisation. There is, however, a large increase in the incidence of Scarlet Fever although not so great as in the previous year. It is possible that overcrowding with its attending insanitary conditions may be the cause. The incidence of Scarlet Fever which occurred in high numbers during the past two years Is declining. It is interesting to note that in the adjoining districts there has also been a decline in the number of cases. Measles and Whooping Cough show a steady decline. -8- -6*- TOTAL CASES NOTIFIED TOTAL DEATHS At ages. At ages. Under 1 year. 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 5-10 10 - 15 15 - 20 20 - 35 35 - 45 45 - 65 65 and over.

TUBERCULOSIS. Under the Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations a register of all notifications is kept and weekly returns of cases are sent to the County Medical Officer.

Towards the end of 1943 the Ministry of Health issued Circular 2871 with the object of applying the principle adopted by the Government that after the demands for war purposes had been met, housing should have the first call on immobile building labour. The scheme involved the granting of licences for building works, and the Town Council decided that the register should be kept and certificates issued by the Borough Surveyor whilst I was to deal with applications in respect of (a) Fork in respect of which a Local Authority issue a statutory notice for the execution of works of maintenance and repair to a house under either the Housing or Public Health Acts. (b) Forks of repair or maintenance which the Local Authority certify to be essential to avoid danger to health or grave deterioration of structure.

The articles of food shown overleaf do not take into account the considerable quantity of foodstuffs which had to be condemned as a result of damage by enemy action. The Sanitary Inspectors had of necessity to spend a great deal of time in dealing with the contents of food shops which sustained war damage during this year, and it is satisfactory to record that as a result of their efforts it was possible by prompt action to salvage a lot of food which might otherwise have been entirely lost.

Sight Dealers' licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk, 5 to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk, 2 supplementary licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk and 2 to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk were granted under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936. Sixty samples of milk were taken for phosphatase test to ascertain if pasteurisation had been properly carried out. All were found to be satisfactory. Twelve samples of ordinary milk were taken for bacteriological examination including animal Inoculation test for tuberculosis. In 2 cases the laboratory reports indicated the presence of tuberculosis and representations were made to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Investigations by officers of that Ministry disclosed the presence of two tubercular cows., which were removed from the herds concerned and slaughtered. DISINEECTION.

RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. In consequence of the interruption of normal work by flying bomb attack little progress was made until towards the end of the year, beyond giving advice to persons making complaint. In December I submitted a comprehensive report to the Corporation as a result of which they authorised acquisition of a van and the appointment of two temporary labourers in order that work might proceed not only on sewers and Corporation properties, but on private, business and industrial -22- premises on behalf of occupiers. The Corporation decided no free service was to be given but that servicing charges amounting to 2/6d. per visit should be made except where a special fee was quoted for long term treatment. No charge was to be made for inspections or advisory visits; a "servicing" visit to include labour, transport, traps, poisons and baits. CONCLUSION. The usual functions of the Department were considerably deranged during this momentous year by war activities. During the early part of the year, when raiding was heavy, members of my staff were loaned to neighbouring Boroughs who had suffered severely and were in dire need of technical assistance. Later the flying bomb attack was responsible for our own Borough being made an Evacuation Area and I was appointed Divisional Disperseals Officer. To cope with this work and the billeting and rehousing of homeless persons I had to switch some of the Public Health staff to the Billeting Office. The situation was difficult, calling for a special effort from everyone, and it is with considerable pride that I record that the required response was forthcoming to such an extent that despite dislocation the vital public health services were maintained. Obviously under such conditions arrears of work accumulated and the tremendous increase of work which accompanied the cessation of hostilities has caused the presentation of this Annual Report to be delayed. I thank my colleagues in all Departments for their ready co-operation. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEOFFREY McCLELLAND. Chief Sanitary Inspector. -23-
