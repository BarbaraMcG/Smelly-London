THIRTY-SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL, OFFICER OF HEALTH, BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1887. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, The year 1887 shows the lowest marriage rate and the lowest birth rate recorded in St. Pancras; and the death rate, although not the lowest, when calculated by omitting the deaths in extra-parochial lunatic asylums as was dope formerly, closely approaches it. The births, and the deaths, the ages at death, and the causes of death, have been corrected, and wherever compared as to sub-districts, those not assignable to any particular sub-district have been distributed according to population. The sub-districts are those of the Registrars of Births and Deaths. The insertion of sub-district tables in the body of the Report has been avoided as much as possible in order to facilitate reading but the details worke 1 out into correct figures appears in the tables at the end of the Report. METEOROLOGY OF 1887. First Quarter. January.—The first half of the month was very cold, with falls of snow; the latter part of the month was milder, with soma fine weather. The rain-fall was small, and fogs were frequent. 6 February was cold and dry, with sharp frosts at times, but some days of pleasant weather. The barometer through the month was remarkably high; the rainfall was small, with snow and fog occasionally. March was very cold; severe wintry weather prevailed, and snow fell frequently. The rainfall was below the average, and fog was prevalent. Vegetation was very backward, but towards the end of the month the weather was milder. Second Quarter. April was very cold and dry, with little rain and cold north-east winds; vegetation still backward, and altogether an unequal month. May was a cold, unseasonable month, with little sun, and the wind prevailing from the northern quarters; the temperature still continuing below the average, and vegetation backward. Some snow fell, but the rainfall was below the average, June was very fine and dry, but the temperature was still below the mean, and the wind was mainly from the north-east. The rainfall was deficient, and the continued deficiency was beginning to make itself felt. Third Quarter. July was a fine very warm month, but the want of rain continued to be severely felt. August was a fine dry month, with severe thunderstorms, and a more than average amount of sunshine. September was cold and unsettled, the temperature being continuously below the average. Fourth Quarter. October was fine, but very cold, the temperature being continuously below the average. The rain-fall was also below the average. November was dry and cold, with temperature, rain-fall. and atmospheric pressure below the average. Strong north-east winds alternated with dense fogs. December was a fine month, with rain-fall somewhat below the average, and the cold was seasonable. 7 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1887. Barometer Temperature. Daily Range of Temperature.

POPULATION. In large towns and cities it becomes a matter of some difficulty to estimate the changes which take place in the population, and this difficulty increases with the length of time elapsed since the census, but there is no reason to depart from the average annual increase of the population of the Parish, carefully calculated at 1,095 in last year's Annual Report. Population of the Sub-Districts. In estimating the population of the sub-districts singly, there is even greater difficulty than in estimating them collectively, and the numbers being smaller, the fallacy of error is proportionately greater. The natural increase of the population, or the excess of births over deaths in the sub-districts during 1886 and 1887, has been as follows:— Sub Districts. Natural Increase. 40.75 per cent. of Natural Increase. 1886 1887 Mean. Regent's Park 354 336 345 141 Tottenham Court 225 218 222 90 Gray's Inn Lane 184 314 249 102 Somers Town 342 356 349 142 Camden Town 210 174 192 78 Kentish Town 1,398 1,263 1,330 542 St. Pancras 2,713 2,661 2,687 1,095 If the natural annual increase in numbers in the whole Parish be 2,687, and the actual annual increase in numbers be 1,095, then the actual increase annually would be represented by 4075 per cent. of the natural increase; but when this is applied to the sub-districts the result, as shewn, does not appear in accord with the probabilities. 9 Variations in the Populations between the Census Periods. Sub-Districts. 1851—61 1861—71 1871—81 Probable Variations. 1881—1891 Regent's Park +3,009 +3,273 + 915 Small increase Tottenham Court + 938 —1 —1,641 Decrease Gray's Inn Lane +1,286 +1,413 +1,026 Increase Somers Town +3,458 —566 —4,164* Decrease Camden Town +2,151 —5,323* —632 Small increase Kentish Town +20,991 +23,881 +19,289 Large increase St. Pancras +31,833 +22,677 +14,793 * Demolitions by Railway Companies. Hence it has been necessary to assume the populations as below:— 1887 Inmates of Public Institutions re-distributed. Regent's Park 39,500 39,920 Tottenham Court 27,500 27,580 Gray's Inn Lane 30,700 30,890 Somers Town 34,600 34,650 Camden Town 17,200 15,630 Kentish Town 93,600 94,430 St. Pancras 213,100 243,100 The statistics are calculated upon the figures in the second column. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Births.—The number of Births occurring in Public Institutions was as follows:— Camden Town Sub-District ... Workhouse 175 Grays Inn Lane „ ... Homes of Hope 42 217 10 Deaths—The number of Deaths, including both Parishioners and Non-Parishioners, occurring in Public Institutions within the Parish was 1396, distributed as follows:— Sub-Districts. Institutions. Deaths. Regent's Park St. Saviour's Cancer Hospital 8 Tottenham Court University College Hospital 349 „ „ Home Hospitals 10 „ „ Central London Sick Asylum 173 Gray's Inn Lane Royal Free Hospital 157 „„ Central Throat and Ear Hospital 9 Somers Town Temperance Hospital 53 Camden Town Workhouse 368 Kentish Town Infirrmarv 224 „ „ North West London Hospital 45 St. Pancras 1396 Of St. Pancras Parishioners 1197 died in Public Institutions, situated in the Parish and in other parts of the Metropolis, including the Metropolitan Asylums' Board's Hospitals. This number is 82 less than during 1886, and 68 more than the average of the preceding 10 years. MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during 1887 was 2082, this number is 115 below the average of the ten preceding years, and the smallest number on record. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in St. Pancras during 1887 was 7,519, this number is 3S9 below the average of the preceding ten years. The rate per 1000 of population was 30'9, the lowest on record, the rate of the preceding decennium being 33.0. The birth-rate of London in 1887 was 31.7. The proportions in the Sub-Districts are given below, the 217 births occurring 11 in Public Institutions having been distributed to the Sub-districts according to population:— Sub Districts. Number of Birth. Birth-rate Regent's Park 1077 26.9 Tottenham Court 740 26.8 Grav's Inn Lane 943 30.5 Somers Town 1194 34.4 Camden Town 551 35.2 Kentish Town 3014 31.9 St. Pancras 7519 30.9 Table No. 2 shows how steadily the Birth-rate has fallen, from over 35 per 1000 in 1876 to under 31 in 1887. DEATHS. During the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1887, the corrected number of deaths was 4,858, equal to a rate of 19.98 per 1000 of population living. This number was 19 less than in 1886, and 48 more than the average of the ten preceding years. The death-rate of London during 1887 was 19.6. Table 2 shows the Heath-rate of the Parish has been steadily falling from an average of over 23 per 1000 in (he decennium previous to 1876 to under 20 in 1887. The following are the death-rates of the various Sub-districts, 228 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular district being distributed according to population. [###}Sub-Districts.

ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The number of Deaths from the principle Zymotic Diseases in St. Pancras was 719, the number in the previous year being 616. The increase was due to Whooping Cough, Scarlatina, Measles and Diphtheria, whilst Diarrhoea showed a diminution. The annual average of the preceding ten years was 727, the year 1887 shows a diminution of Smallpox, Scarlet Fever, and Typhus, Enteric and continued Fevers, and an increase of Measles, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea, upon the numbers of the preceding decennium. The Zymotic Deathrate was 2.95 per 1000 of population, that of London being 3.02, and the proportion per 1000 total deaths being 148. The following table shows the incidence of the mortality in the sub-districts of St. Pancras from the principal Zymotic Diseases:— Sub-Districts. Numbers. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 92 2.30 124.3 Tottenham Court 85 3.008 162.8 Gray's Inn Lane 77 2.49 122.6 Somers Town 125 3.60 148.8 Camden Town 60 3.83 160.0 Kentish Town 280 2.96 159.7 St. Pancras 719 2.95 148.0 For details of the Deaths from Zymotic Diseases which follow, see Tables 8 a, b & c. 14 SMALL-POX. No deaths were caused by small-pox during 1887. This is the first year Oil record in which St. Pancras has not suffered a single death from this disease. MEASLES. There were 145 deaths from measles, in the preceding year the number was 127 and the annual average number for the decennium was 118. Per 1000 of popu lation the death-rate was 0.59 and per 1000 of total deaths 29.8 or 5.7 higher than the decennial average. The incidence of mortality was highest, both in proportion to population and to the total deaths, in Somers Town and lowest in Camden Town, followed by Gray's Inn Lane. SCARLATINA. This disease caused 58 deaths against 26 in the preceding year, and a decennial average of 93, the proportion per 1000 total deaths was 7.1 lower than the decennial average. In the Sub-Districts the incidence of mortality both in proportion to population and to the total deaths was highest in Camden Town and lowest in Gray's Inn Lane. TYPHUS. It is now four years since a death has been recorded from this disease in the District. WHOOPING COUGH. 199 deaths arose from this cause, in the preceding year the number was 120 and the decennial mean 175. The proportion to total deaths in 1887 was 41 per 1000, and for the decennium 35. In proportion both to population and to total deaths Tottenham Court, Camden Town, and Kentish Town stood highest, and Grav's Inn Lane lowest. DIPHTHERIA. From this disease 59 deaths took place, in 1886 the number was 44 and from 1877 to 1866 the annual mean was 42. The proportion per 1000 total deaths was 3.4 above the decennial average. In proportion both to population and total deaths Camden Town stood first in mortality followed by Somers Town, and Gray's Inn Lane followed by Regent's Park stood last. CONTINUED FEVER. One death only cccurred from this disease, of which the decennial average is 3. TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from this disease numbered 28, the decennial average being 60. In proportion to total deaths the decrease is 6.5 per 1000 upon the average of the preceding ten years. In mortality Camden Town, followed by Gray's Inn Lane was highest, and Regent's Park followed by Kentish Town lowest in proportion to population and to total deaths. 15 DIARRHOEA. This complaint was the ultimate cause of 229 deaths, 37 more than in the preceding year, and 48 more than the annual average for the dicennium. Per 1000 of total deaths the number was 1000 more than in the preceding decennium. The incidence of mortality in proportion to it to 1000 of population and to 1000 of total deaths was highest in Gray's Inn Lane and Camden Town, and lowest in Regent's Park and Semers Town. TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The principal Tubercular Diseases, including Phthisis, etc. (see Table 7 E and following), caused 639 deaths, which were distributed in the Sub-Districts as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number.

At the Census of 1881 the density of persons per acre in the Sub-Districts was as follows:— Regent's Park 93—including Canal and Parks. Tottenham Court. 192 „ little free space. Gray's Inn Lane 196 „ „ „ Somers Town 188 „ Railway Termini. Camden Town 102 „ Canal, Railway Terminus, and Gas Works Kentish Town 54 „ Canal, Railway Depot and Fields. At present the public open spaces are as follows:— Parliament Fields—Kentish Town Sub-District. Primrose Hill—Regent's Park Sub-District. Regent's Park— ,, „ ,, St. George's Burial Ground—Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District. St. Andrews „ „ — „ „ _ „ St. James „ „ —Somers Town Sub-District. St. Pancras Gardens—Camden Town Sub-District. St. Martins' Burial Ground— ,, „ Whitfield Burial Ground—Tottenham Court Sub-District. The two latter are not yet acquired. There is a plot of ground entirely surrounded by houses occupied by an industrial class upon which formerly stood the notorious Poplar Place, and which threatens to be again built upon. The density of population in the Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District is great, and it would be a retrogressive step if dwelling houses were built upon these old foundations to perpetuate the crowded and insanitary condition of this area. The vacant plot is not larger than the open space usually attached to industrial dwellings of recent contruction. DWELLINGS. Industrial Dwellings replace but slowly the houses erected many years ago upon the single house principal and let out in single or double rooms to the industrial classes. The overcrowding and want of ventilation in these houses, is, in the absence of any Bye-laws, but inadequately controlled, and in this respect they are not so well placed as "Common" Lodging houses. The House to House inspections were carried on regularly during the year. A list of streets so inspected follows at the end of the Report. COMMON LODGING HOUSES. There are 30 Common Lodging Houses in the Parish, which are maintained in good sanitary condition, a list of these is appended to the Report. CANAL BOATS. Canal Boats are now carefully registered and regulated with great benefit to and improvement in the class that dwell upon them, and especially to the children. No Canal boat was found unregistered during the year. 25 CARAVANS. Caravans and Tents are a class of dwellings for which little space exists in St. Pancras. WATER SUPPLY. The New River Company supplies the whole Parish, with the exception of a strip at the South Western angle hereafter described. The whole of this Company's supply is on the constant service system, and during the past year street hydrants have been fixed throughout the Northern portion of the Parish at short distances apart. The West Middlesex Company supply that portion of the Parish lying West of a line drawn along Tottenham Court Road, Hampstead Road and the London and North Western Railway to Chalk Farm Station. This district is supplied by constant service except that portion lying west of Albany Street and north of Gloucester Bridge. The company should be urged to supply the portion of their district in this Parish by constant service, the district next to Chalk Farm being densely populated. DRAINAGE. The following are the results of the testing of drains of doubtful condition during the year:— No. Tested. RESULT. Satisfactory. Defective. Upon Complaint 146 34 112 After Typhoid Fever 23 17 6 „ Diphtheria 44 24 20 Totals 213 75 138 It would be an advantage for the guidance of householders, and facilitate the work of your officers if St. Pancras possessed some intelligent Bye-laws referring to drainage. SEWERAGE. The street catch-pits in which road refuse is intercepted from the sewers are treated with an antiseptic preservative which prevents decomposition satisfactorily until removed by the scavenging carts. The vexe 1 question of the ventilation of the sewers will never be solved until proper ventilating pipes are carried up to a point above the level of the housetops, although in a few exceptional instances lamp-posts or columns away from houses may be utilised for that purpose with safety. 26 The general disinfection of the Sewers will doubtless ultimately be solved by ample periodical flushing, accomplished automatically where possible. REFUSE REMOVAL. The regular removal of stable refuse proceeds constantly under the vigilance of of your Inspectors, it is rare to receive a complaint of nuisance from this source. House refuse on the other hand is the source of many complaints of accumulation, and until a methodical system of collection from house to house at regular intervals is adopted the removal of dust will never proceed satisfactorily. NUISANCES. An account of the nuisances abated, and of the Sanitary work executed in and within dwellings is given in Table 9. 5,132 premises were inspected and 18,308 re-inspections took place during 1887. FOOD. Tho following is a list of food condemned in 18S7 by your Inspectors:— Date. Name of Article. Quantity. Remarks.

Fined £1 and 2s. costs SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The 37 Licensed Slaughter Houses in the Parish have been kept in cleanly condition, in observance of the Bye-laws regulating them. COW SHEDS. There are 45 Licensed Cow Sheds in the Parish, or three less than in the previous year, which have been in compliance with the Regulations. 27 DAIRIES AND MILKSHOPS. The supervision of Dairies and Milkshops is not in the hands of your Sanitary Authority, as in other parts of the country, but in the hands of the Metropolitan Board of" Works. BAKEHOUSES. There are 215 Bakehouses in the Parish. They have been kept in compliance with the Regulations. MARINE STORES. The Marine Stores have been inspected from time to time, in order to prevent I any nuisance liable to arise therefrom. LEGISLATION. Only three Bills of Sanitary import passed the legislature during 1887. The Water Companies' Regulation of Powers Bill, which prevents water companies from cutting off the water supplied to tenants, for which the landlord is I liable. A very useful measure as far as it goes; but as a house is held to be unfit for human habitation when without water supply, sanitarily nothing short I of prohibiting occupied houses from being deprived of water will be satisfactory. The Butter Substitutes Bill enacts that all imitations of Butter shall be sold as "Margarine," and be so marked. An Act to Consolidate the Law relating to Coroners.—This Act is only the consolidation which usually precedes amendments. Any amendment should provide for the proper certification of the cause of death (the "by what") by written medical certificate, the coroner enquiring into the manner of death (the "by whom,") the jury basing their finding upon the combined evidence, and attaching thereto the medical certificate, the present method of coroner and jury certifying the medical cause of death being extremely unsatisfactory in result.
