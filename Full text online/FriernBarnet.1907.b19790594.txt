FRI 5 Friern Barnet Urban District Council REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year 1907, by FRANK A. SPREAT, F.R.C.S. Eng., D.P.H., R.C.P.S., Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. New Southgate: Printed, by Pickering & Co., 113, Friern Barnet Road. 1908. TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1907. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Barnet is situated in the London area, and is bounded on the North by East Barnet, and on the East by Southgate, on- the South by Hornsey, and on the West by Finchley. It comprises 1,303 acres 1 rood (including 149 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of the Colney Hatch Asylum), most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being London clay with here and there patches of gravel. The General Character of the District:—For the purposes of representation, statistics, &c., it is divided into three Wards—North, South, and Central; and in addition, Colney Hatch Asylum—situated between the Central and South Wards—is treated separately to a great extent, as to include the deaths of such an institution with those of the District would create a mistaken and adverse impression. The population is unevenly distributed; thus, in the NorthWard a large part is pasture land, and the houses for 2 the most part are of a higher rateable value, being detached and separated some distance from each other ; and this obtains also in the West portion of the Central Ward, On the other hand, in the Eastern or Holly Park side of the Ward the houses are in terraces and streets. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses in the neighbourhood of New Southgate Station and the South-west part, where building is in progress, being of a superior character; whilst the remainder are the usual six-roomed houses, inhabited in many cases by more than one family. In this Ward also there is a tendency to the erection of flats and the conversion of six-roomed houses into flats. The population in 1881 was 4,405; in 1891, 6,716;and in 1901, 8,816; the average number of persons per house being respectively 6.01 and 5.6 for the two latter years, as estimated from figures supplied from the Census Office by the Registrar-General. Total population at all ages at Census of 1901:— District, 8,816; Asylum 2,750 11,566 Numbers of inhabited houses 1,633 Average number of persons per house 5.6 Houses Wards. North. South. Central. Total Occupied 358 853 617 1,828 Unoccupied 14 165 79 258 Births. These numbered 294, giving a birth rate of 28.9, being an increase of 1.5. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 294—117 =177, the excess in 1906 being 152. On reference to the Tables it will be seen that there is a decrease in the total population due to the great number of empty houses along the tram route and empty flats on the Freehold. 3 Deaths. There were 108 deaths (see Tables 1, 2 and 4) registered in the District, excluding the Asylum, giving a death rate of 10.5, an improvement of .5 on 1906, and with the exception of 1905 the lowest rate since 1899. 10 deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it and one death took place inside the District of a person not belonging to it, giving a net total of 118— 1 = 117, showing a net death rate of 11.4, and producing a corrected death rate of 12.2. Infantile Mortality.—The infantile mortality for the year 1906 was 130. and was above the average for the County of Middlesex, being almost equal to that of London 131, and England aud Wales 133. This year there has been a notable improvement, the rate per 1000 births being as low as 81. On reference to Table V. it is interesting to note that of the 24 deaths, premature births (3), congenital defects (3), marasmus (4) convulsions (4), and overlying account tor 15, the remaining 9 deaths being due to more general causes, viz.—Tuberculous Meningitis 1, Bronchitis 2, Pneumonia 2, Whooping Cough 2, "other" causes 2. It will be noticed that there is not a single death from Diarrhœa. In former years diarrhœa has caused a large proportion of the deaths under one year of age. It is remarkable that while all the supposed factors in infantile mortality, viz.: occupiers of three-roomed tenements, ignorance of the mother as to proper care of the child, hand-feeding and the entrusting of infants to the care of young children whilst the mothers are out at work, were presumably present as usual, the absence of conditions causing diarrhoea, whatever they are, possibly a cool summer, should have made so striking a difference. During; a hot, dry summer, the condition of the food taken by the mother and child must enter largely into the question of the causes of diarrhoea, and here I would repeat my opinion that it is desirable that there should be some definite guide as to what is proper accommodation for the storage of food in premises let out in 3 and 6 roomed tenements. 4 The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate since 1885. This gives an idea of the growth and health of the District during that period. Year. Houses. Population. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths. Death-rate. Occupied. Unoccupied. 1885 909 237 5269 157 29.7 66 12.5 1886 983 183 5496 207 37.6 68 12.3 1887 1022 106 5733 204 35.4 53 9.2 1888 1046 125 5900 207 34.8 71 11.8 1889 1076 86 6238 219 35.1 75 12.6 1890 1089 108 6507 258 39.6 94 14.4 1891 1117 84 6787 218 32.1 84 12.3 1892 1179 118 7079 191 26.9 70 11.2 1893 1216 72 7384 209 28.3 76 10.3 1894 1264 56 7467 206 27.5 77 10.3 1895 1277 58 7698 204 26.5 77 10 1896 1377 19 8377 213 25.4 72 8.5 1897 1388 17 8355 228 27.2 104 12.4 1898 1441 8 8668 217 25.0 85 9.8 1899 1482 10 8916 236 26.5 99 11.1 1900 1564 57 9114 248 27.2 105 11.5 1901 1558 104 8816 242 27.4 99 11.2 1902 1633 143 9145 270 29.5 105 11.4 1903 1686 144 9442 294 31.1 96 10.6 1904 1714 160 9758 296 30.3 103 11.7 1905 1843 150 10470 291 27.7 104 9.9 1906 1863 192 10625 291 27.4 139 11 1907 1828 258 10237 294 28.9 117 10.5 The Principal Epidemic Diseases. The Zymotic Death Rate—death from the following infections diseases: Small-pox, Measles, Scarlatina, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Diarrhœa, Fever (Typhus, Typhoid and Continued)—was 0.58. This decrease was due to the absence of deaths from Diarrhœa, Enteritis, Croup aud Measles. 5 The principal Epidemic Diseases Death-rate in previous years was:— 1884 2.1 1892 1.0 1900 0.5 1885 1.2 1893 2.3 1901 1.8 1886 2.7 1894 1.6 1902 1.4 1887 0.8 1895 0.9 1903 1.4 1888 1.5 1896 1.5 1904 1.1 1889 0.7 1897 2.5 1905 1.0 1890 1.6 1898 1.9 1906 1.5 1891 1.5 1899 2.5 Small-Pox. No case occurred. Scarlet Fever. This disease has been extraordinarily prevalent during the year especially at the latter end. In February there was an outbreak of five cases in the same house. On careful investigation I noticed that the mother was suffering from a thin discharge from the nose, and suggested a bacterial examination which disclosed that she was suffering from Diphtheria, probably post Scarlatinal in nature and possibly the source of the other Scarlet Fever cases. Upon isolating the mother there were no further cases. Chiefly in the South Ward a marked increase of the number of cases of this disease commenced about the end of July, 50 cases in all occurred as compared with 19 in 1906. With regard to the origin of this epidemic after considering all usual sources of infection, mode of onset, and character of incidence, it would appear to be due to the very general prevalance of this disease in the Counties of Loudon and Middlesex. There were no deaths. Thirtyfive cases were removed to Hospital. In accordance with what has previously been observed there was a large preponderance of females attacked, viz. 31 as against 19 males. Diptheria. There were 17 cases, of these ten occurred in 6 the South Ward, and six in the Central. With regard to the greater number occurring in the South Ward there was no common source and the cases were scattered. No deaths took place. Typhoid. Only one case occurred, which ended fatally. It will be remembered that there were ten cases last year, thought to be due to infection from flies infesting a dust shoot adjoining the south-east corner of the District. Tn May there were complaints of a similiar dust shoot being formed in the same locality, representations were made to the adjoining Local Authority aud the shoot was discontinued and the material burnt. There does not appear to have been an unusual number of flies present during the summer. Chickenpox. There were a few cases in the early part of the year in the North Ward. Measles. This disease was removed from the list of notifiable diseases in 1900. There were a few cases in the North Ward in April. In June there was an outbreak in the South portion of the South Ward, that is that part south of the Asylum. The incidence was chiefly amongst young children, there were 50 cases and 113 absentees. The schools were closed for 14 days. Rapid abatement of the epidemic followed. During the period of closure the schools were carefully disinfected by formalin spray and sulphur dioxide. The number of cases for previous years were— 1897 273 1901 292 1898 142 1902 186 1899 19 1903 150 1900 15 1904 90 7 Whooping Cough. Was prevalent during the early part of the year, and there was a death in each of the North and South Wards. Diarrhœa. There were no deaths from this disease, and this notable absence was probably due to the cool summer. Tuberculosis. There were 15 deaths from Phthisis (Consumption) and 7 from other Tuberculous diseases. In each case that has come under my notice the nature of the disease has been explained and disinfectants and leaflets supplied. Disinfection after removal and fatal cases has been offered and has been readily accepted. In the Asylum there were 35 deaths, which is not so favourable as the last year, but is better than the three preceding years. The figures are given below for the previous years. Isolation is carried out in the Asylum as far as possible for Phthisical patients. 1892 16 1897 9 1902 42 1893 16 1898 13 1903 56 1894 12 1899 14 1904 38 1895 6 1900 32 1905 20 1896 19 1901 24 1906 35 Influenza. This disease of a Gastric and Hepatic type has been prevalent in the early part of the year. There were two deaths. Cerebro-Spinal Disease. This disease was added to the list of notifiable diseases in June. No cases occurred in the District. Table of Infectious Diseases.

It will be seen from Table III. that (excluding the Asylum) 78 notification certificates of Infections Diseases were received as compared with 50 in 1906. The increase was due to the large number of notifications of Scarlet Fever. On receipt of information respecting infections cases, the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended, in the case of children, and their employers, in the case of adults, notified Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and, where accepted, is carried out (subject to beds being obtainable). After the recovery, or removal, of an infectious case, disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of sulphur and formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served where necessary. Clothes, bedding, etc., are removed to Finchley where they are put through the steam disinfector. Antitoxin is supplied free to medical men for use in 9 cases of Diphtheria occurring in the District. Supplies of Antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central, and the residence ot theM.O.H. in the North Ward for the convenience of medical men. Bacteriological Examinations. Are made on request at the expense of the Authority, hut not as a general rule. Isolation Hospital. The District is without any separate provision for Isolation accommodation, and relies on being able to procure beds in the Hospitals of neighbouring Authorities, viz. Enfield, Southgate, aud Hendon. I have in my previous reports drawn attention to the above unsatisfactory conditions, and expressed the opinion that this makeshift arrangement would fail us when most we needed beds, that is when there was a general epidemic involving this Authority together with the adjoining districts, when they would need the whole of their accommodation for themselves. During the Scarlet Fever epidemic, involving the Counties of London aud Middlesex, in the latter part of the year, great difficulty was for a time experienced in obtaining beds, and upon my laying the matter before my Authority I was instructed to inspect various premises with a view to temporary accommodation being provided as soon as possible. In the meantime beds have been found in the Hospitals mentioned above. I am glad to be able to report that negotiations, which have been in progress for sometime, with a neighbouring authority are almost completed. By this arrangement definite Isolation accommodation will be assured to the District for a term of years. Disposal of Sewage. Situation of the Works.—The Sewage Works are situated on the South side of the District ( in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook, into which the effluent flows. The original Works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M. Inst. C.E., and were executed under his direction. 10 The working of the tanks and original filters have been altered and improved, and three Contact Beds have been constructed under the supervision of Mr. E. J. Reynolds, Assoc. M. Inst. C.E., further additions are contemplated as mentioned below. The method of treatment is as follows:— The sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime equal to 4 grains per gallon is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed, It then receives aluminoferrie to the extent of one grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing through a salmon ladder, and in this condition flows into settling tanks, of which there are four, each having a capacity of 70,000 gallons. These tanks are divided by concrete walls, on which is an open channel divided by sluice doors, so that either one, two, three, or four tanks can be worked at a time and alternately as required. The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an open channel, then on to first Contact Beds and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. A Wrought Iron fence has been fixed along the Southeast and East side of the Sewage Works, from Alexandra Road to the G.N. Railway Co's land on the North. This fence also enclosed 7¼ acres added to the Works in 1906. A large quantity of oak fencing replaced by iron fencing has been utilised for fencing in proposed additional and present allotments land from the Sewage Works. The Council have had under consideration during the past year, the construction of additional Sewage Filters and another Settling Tank. Plans and estimates have been prepared, and application has been made to the Local Government Board for sanction to borrow the necessary money to construct two filter beds and one additional settling tank. Trough distributors have been fixed in order to distribute the sewage more uniformly over the whole area of the storm water filters. This has resulted in a marked improvement in the working of the beds. The rainfall during the whole of 1907 was very heavy and continuous, there being no opportunity to rest the beds. 11 Sewerage. The roads in this District have separate sewers for storm water, and all houses except the older ones have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to connect the storm water from the old houses into the surface water sewers as opportunities occur. This is very necessary, as everything should be done to make the daily flow of sewerage at any sewage works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely place Section of the District has to be pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. The sewage from several houses in the Avenue; Holmsdale Road, and Stanhope Road has been diverted into the gravitation sewers, and at the same time separated from the storm water. Sewers have been laid in Queen's Avenue (continuation), Myddleton Park, Oakleigh Gardens, Athenæum Road and a commencement has been made of sewering Pollard Road (Myddleton Park), Ivy Avenue, Hollyfield Avenue (Hollyfield Estate). Surface water sewers have been laid in parts of Friern Lane and Oakleigh Road, N., from Myddleton Park to Russell Lane. Ambulance. This District does not yet possess an Ambulance, but satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Finchley D.C. for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have an excellent Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet's West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coroner's Inquests. The large room on the West Side of the Council Offices has been fitted up for Coroner's Inquests, and during the year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet Inquests have been held there. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary this room has been found convenient for holding the Finchley Inquests. Formerly the Inquests were held at Public Houses. 12 Dust Disposal and Removal. The Council undertakes the work through the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made throughout the District weekly by means of covered vans. Builders are required to provide portable Circular Sanitary Dustbins to all new houses, and owners are requested to replace worn ont bins with these. The refuse is chiefly taken on to the Sewage Farm and precautions are taken that it does not become a nuisance. Light Railways. In the Spring the M.C.C. Light Railway from Wood Green to Station Road top (near London and Provincial Bank) was opened. Friern Barnet is thus connected direct by tram to Wood Green and Finsbury Park. The Station Road from the District Boundary to the top was widened by the M.C.C. to a minimum of 50 feet. The M.C.C. have deposited plans for laying the metals along the Friern Barnet Road and Woodhouse Lane, but the time for the construction of the lines has been extended by the Board of Trade until December 31st, 1908. The question of the very necessary widening of the G.N. R. Bridge over the Friern Barnet Road is also being considered by the M.C.C. and the District Council in connection with this Railway together with paving the footways with Patent Victoria Stone, kerbing aud channelling, and the paving of the track with wood blocks in place of granite setts as now suggested by the M.C.C., the latter, in my opinion, are noisy, do not prevent vibration and are not so easily cleaned and scavenged. The M.C.C. have bought much of the property along the Friern Barnet Road in order to make the necessary widenings, which accounts for the many empty houses along this road. Electric Lighting Order. The Council's Electric Lighting Order has lapsed. The 13 Finchley District Council seek powers, through a Parliamentry Bill, to supply Electricity to portions of this District adjoining the Great North Road aud Woodhouse Lane. The London and District Supply Bill which is now before Parliament, which, if sanctioned, would affect the District, has been considered by the Council, and the Council have resolved to petition against the Bill becoming law. Public Improvements. Footways have been paved with Patent Victoria Stone in various parts of the District, including Oakleigh Road, N. (from Boundary to opposite All Saints Church), and parts of Colney Hatch Lane. Kerb has been laid in Oakleigh Road. A large amount of tar-paving has also been done as weather permitted. The dangerous corner by Carlisle Place has been much improved. Widenings.—Land has been given up to widen the highway in Oakleigh Road, N., Oakleigh Road, S., and in Colney Hatch Lane, The Colney Hatch Lane near the Hermitage has been widened and much improved by a give and take line agreed upon with the L.C.C. Asylum's Committee. Arrangements have also been made with the owner of Hollyfield Estate to widen this Lane from the jnnction with Friern Barnet Road to the Hermitage. The land given up in Oakleigh Road and opposite Halliwick Parade, has been made and paved with Victoria Stone. Athenaum Road.—The London and County Land Co., the owners of this Private Road, have laid portions of a Surface Water Sewer and widened the road to 40 feet. New Roads.—The owners of the various Estates have made roads called: Qneens Road, Loring Road, Park View Crescent, and Spencer Road. The Contractors are engaged in making up Pollard Road, Roads on the Hollyfield Estate, Queens Avenue Continuation, &c. 14 Lighting. —Additional Lamps have been placed in various parts of the District, and now almost all the lamps are fittted with Incandescent Burners. The Refuge Lamps and lamps in a portion of the South Ward have been fitted with an automatic clockwork arrangement for lighting and extinguishing lamps. These lamps are left alight all night and the Council are extending the system. Private Streets.—The following private streets having been made up, have been taken over by the Council:—Wilton Road, Carlton Road, Wetherill Road, Hartland Road, and Kennard Road. Plans and Estimates have been prepared, the Notices have been served, the sanction of the L.G.B. has been obtained, and tenders have been accepted for making up Stanley Road, Crown Road, and Hampden Road from Colney Hatch Lane to Pembroke Road. Another road is under consideration, viz. Alexandra Road. Constant Water Supply.—It will be remembered that at the end of 1900 the Company had given the first area of the District (Central Ward) a Constant Water Supply, with the result that at the end of this year the whole of the District had been given a Constant Water Supply. Besides the additional protection from fire,. the Constant Supply should be a great improvement to the District from the point of view of health, sanitation, and generally. Recreation Ground and Open Spaces.—A suggestion was made that an additional piece of land should be bought and attached to the Recreation Ground in Oakleigh Road, but the price was prohibitive. Seats have been provided and the Priory Lawn is opened during the Summer months to the Public. Tree Planting.—Additional trees have been planted in various Roads of the District, and dead ones replaced. Dust Prevention.—Although 1907 was by no means a dry year, it has been found that the dust from the present day motor traffic could only be kept under by constant watering of the Main Roads. Owing to there being no long spell of fine dry weather no further roads were tar painted. 15 Combined Drainaqe.—The following have been reconstructed:—Nos. 48, 49 aud 50, the Avenue; Nos. 117 to 127, Pembroke Road ; Friern Place, Oakleigh Road. Vent Columns.—The work of fixing Sewer Vent Columns has been continued in various roads. Change of Name.—The Council have sanctioned the name "Oakleigh Avenue" in place of "All Saint's Road" on the Oakleigh Park Estate. Road from the Avenue.—Negotiations are being made with the Great Northern Railway Company to acquire land to make a road from the bottom of the Avenue into Oakleigh Road, S. This would be a much desired improvement. As Cul de Sac roads, particularly in poor neighbourhoods such as the Avenue, are bad from a moral and sanitary point of view. Legislation.

Application has been made with the view of such orders being obtained. Registration of Births. This measure was before the Council but was not adopted. Schools. 1, All Saints'. 2, St. John's. 3, Friern Lane. 4, St. Paul's. 5, St. Peter's. 6. The Middlesex County Council School, Sydney Road. All these six Schools have been frequently inspected and have been found in good order. Weekly lists of absentees are forwarded to me by the School Head on request, and at shorter periods during epidemics. Some cases of pustular impetigo occurred in the All Saints', Friern Lane, and St. Paul's Schools. The St. Peter's Schools were thoroughly disinfected after the measles epidemic with sulphur dioxide and formalin Disinfectants are supplied for use in the lavatories and urinals, and also to be added to the water with which the slates, desks, and floors are washed. 17 The floor of the large schoolroom at All Saint's has been relaid. Slaughter Houses. There are two in the District, which have been brought and are kept as up to date as possible. They have been regularly visited and have been found clean. Cowsheds, Dairies, and Milk Shops. A list of these will be found under the scheme to the end of the Report. I have carefully impressed upon the Owners and Managers or Dairies the importance of keeping the milk clean and cool and have suggested the grooming of the cows and the provision of proper washing facilities for the milkers, and overalls. Adulteration of Food. As in former years considerable attention has been given to this subject, small general shops, confectioners, and ice cream vendors have received particular supervision.
