STPAN 27 Saint Pancras, Middlesex. FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1870. To the Vestrymen of St. Pancras. Gentlemen, Since my last Annual Report was presented to you a new census of the parish has been taken, which enables me to furnish more correct tables than usual of the respective rates of mortality in the various sub-districts of the parish, and to correct the returns of past years. From the appended table it will be seen that the population of St. Pancras has increased from 198,788 in 1861, to 221,594 in 1871; being an increase of 22,806. Although St. Pancras is still the most populous parish in the metropolis, the increase of population is less than was anticipated. Indeed, the natural increase of population (the excess of births over deaths) has been somewhat diminished by the excess of the number of emigrants from the parish over the number of immigrants into the parish. The population has increased 9.3 per cent. in the ten years 1861-71, in the Regent's Park sub-district, 5.1 per cent. in the Gray's Inn Lane sub-district, and 53.9 per cent. in the Kentish Town sub-district; whilst it has decreased to an inappreciable extent in the Tottenham Court subdistrict, 1.4 per cent. in the Somers Town sub-district, and 22.4 per cent. in the Camden Town sub-district. In the whole parish the increase was 11.5 per cent. The increase of house accommodation has not been commensurate with the increase of population. There are now on the average more persons inhabiting each house than in 1861, this must exert an injurious effect upon the health of the parish. In the middle of the year 1870, the population of St. Pancras was about 220,000. The number of deaths registered in St. Pancras during the 52 weeks ending December 31st, 1870, was 5,420, from which should be deducted 200 | 12 22 | 8 | 71. 2 111 deaths in the Strand Union Workhouse, and 10 deaths in the Highgate Infirmary, of non-parishioners. The number of deaths is thus reduced to 5,299, or 5,814 for the year of 365 days. During the same period there were registered 7,632 births, from which must be deducted 37 births in the Strand Union Workhouse, and one birth in the Highgate Infirmary of children born of pauper non-parishioners; and the correct number of births is thus reduced to 7,594, or 7,615 for the year of 365 days. The natural increase of the population in 1870 was hence 2,301. The births exceeded those of 1869 by 38; the deaths exceeded those of that year by 352; and the natural increase of the population was 293 less than in the preceding year. In 1870, the death-rate was 24.15 per 1,000. In 1869, ,, „ 22.81 ,, In 1868, „ „ 22.50 ,, In 1867, „ „ 22.25 ,, In 1866, „ „ 24.45 ,, In 1865, „ „ 24.80 ,, In 1864, „ „ 26.03 ,, In 1863, „ „ 23.28 ,, In 1862, „ „ 21.80 ,, In 1861, „ „ 23.00 ,, The average annual rate of mortality of the 10 years 1861-70, was 23.51 per 1,000 persons living. The death-rate in 1870 hence exceeded the average of the last 10 years, and was 1.34 per 1,000 above that of 1869. The birth-rate was 34.61 per 1,000, or very nearly the same as in the preceding year. In the metropolis, as a whole, the annual rate of mortality in 1870 was 24.12 per 1,000; in the North District, of which St. Pancras forms a part, the rate of mortality was 23.8 per 1,000. The death-rate in St. Pancras was thus 0.03 per 1,000 above the metropolitan average, and 0.35 per 1,000 above that of the North Districts of the metropolis. MORTALITY IN THE SEVERAL SUB-DISTRICTS AND IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. In the year 1870, the deaths, excluding those that occurred in public institutions, exceeded those of 1869 in every sub-district, except in that of Gray's Inn, where the deaths were slightly below those of the preceding year. In all the public institutions in the parish the deaths exceeded those of 1869. 3 The mortality returns are now further complicated by those from the Highgate Infirmary, a portion only of which is allotted to St. Pancras. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. The deaths among children under five years of age were 2,166; being 57 in excess of those in 1869. The deaths among persons upwards of 60 years of age were 1,235; being 174 in excess of those in the preceding year. 2019 persons died between the ages of five and 60 years; this is 145 in excess of those of 1869. The mortality was thus greater in 1870 than in 1869 among children, among adults, and among the aged. SMALL POX AND VACCINATION. In my last annual report I drew attention to an apparently sudden extension of this disease into seven of the eight wards into which the parish is divided. During the year under review Small Pox was referred to in ten out of twelve of my monthly reports to the Sanitary Committee. One of these reports calling attention to the prevalent neglect of Vaccination was forwarded to the Guardians of the Poor. My representations, however, led to no practical steps being taken to avert the epidemic which was so visibly impending, and the closing months of the year found St. Pancras ripe for an epidemic, unprepared to meet one, and with a sufficiency of centres of infection to speedily breed a wide-spread outbreak of the disease. How rapidly the disease spread at the beginning of the current year, and what steps were taken to stay its progress, must appear in the report for the year 1871, and not in this report. During the twelve months ending Michaelmas, 1870, the number of children under one year of age, successfully vaccinated by the Public Vaccinators, was 2,193, as compared with 2,497 in 1869, and 2,871 in 1868. Such a lamentable falling off in the number of vaccinations speaks volumes as to the laxity of the administration of the law. 179 cases of Small Pox were reported, and 21 deaths occurred in the parish from the disease. I am unable to supply the omission of the number of deaths in hospitals, for the information has been refused me at the Highgate Small Pox Hospital. I have applied to the Poor Law officers for information as to the number of deaths among paupers from Small Pox in hospitals, but they are unable to supply me with the requisite information; no record being kept at the Guardians' office of the results of the disease in the cases sent into hospital. 4 SCARLET FEVER. The terrible epidemic of Scarlet Fever, to which I drew attention in my last annual report, continued with unabated severity till about the close of the year 1870, and 477 deaths ensued from it, besides a few of the 34 cases that died in the London Fever Hospital. Of these 34 cases some were scarlet, some typhus, and some enteric (typhoid) fever. I regret that such Sanitary measures as we were able to take in the absence at that time of a disinfecting chamber, and with the supineness that exists among the public as to the adoption of preventive measures, were of little avail compared with what they might have been under more favorable circumstances in staying the outbreak. SANITARY WORKS. A Table is given, kindly furnished as usual by Mr. Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Works Department, of the chief Sewerage Works carried out in St. Pancras during the year. It appears that in 1870, of brick sewers, 1,352 feet; of pipe sewers, 240 feet; and of brick barrel sewers, 520 feet were laid: all except the pipe sewers, at private cost, but under the official supervision of the Officers of the Works Department. Many sewers were repaired, and all the district sewers were well deodorized with carbolic acid. I am sorry to add that the main sewers of the Metropolitan Board of Works were less thoroughly deodorized. A Table is also appended, drawn up by the Clerk, Mr. John Leach, of the Sanitary improvements carried out under the inspection of the Sanitary Inspectors, acting under my supervision. 5 RETURN of the principal Sewer Works which were executed during the year 1870.

It has been necessary in 32 cases to enforce compliance with notices by Police Court proceedings. The market places are frequently visited, and 120 seizures were made during the year of stale and unsound fish, fruit, vegetables, and other articles of food exposed for sale, amongst which may be enumerated:— 14 pads, 14½ kits, 2 turns, 1 box, 2 trunks, 2 baskets, and 40 loose plaice. 53 boxes, 1 basket, 4 pads, 4 barrels, 2 kits of herrings. 3 boxes, 16 pads, and 13 loose mackerel. 1 barrel of guard fish. 1 trunk, 1 pad, and 1 barrel of haddocks. 41 pairs and 1 trunk of soles. 2 baskets and 3 bushels of sprats. 2 pads and 1 box of mixed fish. 1 pad of whitings. 2 baskets, 1 pad, 2 flats, and 4 bushels of shrimps. 10 lobsters. 3 barrels, 4 pottles, 6 kits, and 45 loose crabs. 1 sack of periwinkles. 6½ bushels and 1 gallon of whelks. 15 dozens of brocoli. 2 crates of cauliflowers. 15 sacks and 6 bushels of onions. 3 lbs. of pork, 67 fowls, 77 ducks, 37 rabbits. 1 bushel, 2 parcels, and a quantity of cherries. A quantity of oranges, 1 bushel of white currants, 52 sieves of black currants, and 1 basket of strawberries. Many nuisances, besides those classified above, have been abated. The "Workshop Regulation Act" has been enforced; all licensed cowsheds and slaughter-houses have been regularly inspected; and the inspection of houses visited by fever, scarlet fever, small pox, diphtheria, and fatal forms of diarrhœa, has been carried out, and their disinfection enjoined upon the inmates. REPORT ON THE SUPPLY OF GAS. The averaging illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company was, as tested according to the "Metropolis Gas Act, 1860," 14.5 standard sperm candles. The highest illuminating power observed was 16.9, and the lowest 13.1 candles. If the testings were made according to the Imperial Company's New Act, the numbers would be increased by about one-sixth without any real increase in the illuminating power, and thus the illuminating power would be observed always to keep above the statutory minimum. 8 It is, however, more interesting to observe what increase in illuminating power has been obtained by the New Act, which nominally raises the standard two candles. I find that the real increase of illuminating power is one-fifth of a candle. Ammonia was, of course, one of the impurities rarely absent; but its amount was never excessive. Sulphuretted hydrogen was never detected. Sulphur in all forms averaged 19.8 grains per 100 cubic feet, varying from 10.52 to 28.58 grains. The old Act prescribed 20 grains per 100 cubic feet as a permissible maximum; but no maximum is fixed by the New Act. (Signed) THOMAS STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1871.
