MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the 72nd Annual Report on the health and circumstances of the population of the Borough of Southall. During the year, the general standard of health of the population was reasonably good. The Death Rate and the Infant Mortality Rate were slightly lower, the Birth Rate rose very high. Infectious Disease figures were low for everything except dysentery, an outbreak of which resulted from the case of a woman who discharged herself from hospital in an infectious state, infected her own family, who in turn infected the children in an infant school. The disease was contained locally, except for a few individual cases, but much work and supervision to achieve this had to be carried out by the school staff and the staff of the Department. The amount of Tuberculosis discovered in the year was lower but four persons died of this disease, which accounted for only one death in 1961. Welfare provisions continued to increase, more Meals on Wheels were delivered to a larger number of the elderly housebound, more Chiropody facilities became available, a scheme for a second Work Centre for the Elderly got under way, the numbers of persons undertaking voluntary work with the social clubs was growing, and the number of members of these clubs was rising steadily. Work on the conversion of Southall into a smokeless town was considerable during the year; the programme was speeded up following a request from the Minister of Health for all black areas to endeavour to become completely smoke-free as quickly as possible. Houses in Multiple Occupation increased during 1962, and a great deal of inspectors' 1 time was taken up with the visits, measurements, and reports necessary in connection with this; the prospect that these houses will be registered compulsorily when the legal sanction becomes operative is most welcome, so that early information on this type of use of a premises can enable the staff to inform owners of the sanitary requirements of any dwelling for a prescribed number of persons before occupation, instead of coming after occupation to investigate whether any fault is being committed. Patterns of disease change gradually over the years, and so the pattern of planning for health varies also. While the reduction of poverty, the improvement of the physical health of children, the eradication of some infectious diseases and the limitation of others, the improvement of standards of housing, and the greater care taken in the handling of food, are reducing the need for so great a concentration of work on control of infection, sanitary defects in houses and the supervision of food premises, the problems of increasing pollution of air, by smoke and sulphur, and by other industrial gases, the increasing pollution of water from industrial and domestic sources, the increasing deterioration in mental stability shown by the statistics of crime, the increase in drug taking, the longing for publicity, the seeking of sensation, the increasing number of deaths from diseases associated with stress, the increasing use of nuclear fission products, have altered the orientation of the work in the Department. That the old problems remain, however, is evidenced by the reports, in the following pages, on Smallpox, Dysentery, and Vermin Infestation, and no slackening of care can be permitted. Much trouble has been taken by everyone who has been asked to contribute information for this report, and I am sincerely grateful for this, and also for the work of the Department staff both in the preparation of this report and throughout the year. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, luwgaul a. Glass Medical Officer of Health. Manor House, Southall. Telephone Numbers: SOU 3621-2.

The Borough is highly industrial, containing large factories for food processing and engineering, and many smaller factories producing a great variety of semi-finished or finished products. The development of the Borough has been rapid, mainly within the present century, and so there has been little slum clearance to deal with, but there is still a good deal of sub-standard housing, i.e. houses without baths or without hot water supply, and some without indoor sanitary accommodation. The problem of multi-occupation of such houses by members of the same family or by different families brings problems of cleanliness and the maintenance of freedom from infectious disease and from diseases encouraged by 5 faulty hygiene. Areas of land in two neighbouring Boroughs have been used for Southall Council house building because of the shortage of land within the Borough and to assist with the housing needs of the people of Southall, and use is also made of New Town housing. The Census Report has now become available and in 1961, the year of census taking, the number of persons per acre in Southall was 20.3 compared with 21.4 in 1951, and the number of persons per room of each inhabited house was 0.70 compared with 0.77 in 1951. These figures indicate that much improvement of overcrowding has taken place over the decade, although it seems, in day to day working, as if there was little change. Ninety-two persons over ninety years of age were recorded—in 1951 there were only 4; and the number of Old Age Pension age was 7,892 (2,324 males over 65 and 5,568 females over 60) compared with 6,803 (2,141 males, 4,662 females). It will be seen that there has been an increase of over 20 % in the number of Pension Age persons in ten years and this increase has been mainly in females. The Census shows also that 3,707 of these people live in one or two person households, 787 alone, and 1,894 in a house where the only other occupant is also of pension age. The availability of adequate water supply and sanitation in the district can be seen to have extended to a larger proportion of the population since the previous census, but it appears that 1,848 households, comprising a minimum of 4,994 persons, were still entirely without a fixed bath (this compares with 3,071 households, comprising a minimum of 9,362 persons, in 1951); 1,612 households were entirely without a hot water tap, 56 households were without a water closet within or adjoining their premises and 11 households without a water tap within or adjoining their premises (five of these were show ground caravans). In addition, there are large numbers of families sharing household facilities such as water, stove and water closets, with resultant lowering of hygienic standards, and the development of stress situations because of friction over the use of these arrangements. These figures show the urgent need for the provision of bathing facilities in the interests of hygiene, and the building of slipper baths is planned by the Borough Council and has been given high priority amongst their schemes. Figures obtained by courtesy of the Manager of the Southall Employment Exchange and the Youth Employment Officer show the general trend of the employment position in Southall during the year, and are as follows:— Men Women Number of persons registered as unemployed at Southall Employment Exchange on 10th December, 1962 275 42 Number of unfilled vacancies as at 5th December, 1962 90 87 Boys Girls Number of persons registered as unemployed at the Youth Employment Office on 10th December, 1962 11 4 Number of unfilled vacancies as at 5th December, 1962 21 33 The Youth Employment Officer also made the following comments:— "These figures show no appreciable change over last year, and taking the year as a whole, it was possible to find suitable employment for the majority of youngsters without undue difficulty. However, the 'bulge' gave us a larger number of school leavers to place and made competition for apprenticeship-type vacancies very keen. By the same token, we had to find work for more boys and girls at the lower end of the ability scale and this was often just as much a problem as to find suitable openings for their brighter contemporaries." Swimming Baths The Southall Borough Council maintains an outdoor swimming pool in the Recreation Ground, which is one of the public parks, and this pool is used very fully during the summer months. The surface area of the bath is 3,600 square feet (120 feet by 30 feet), cubic capacity 16,500 cubic feet (110,000 gallons). The water is treated by break-point chlorination and the normal chlorine content of 1.0 parts per million at the shallow end and 0.7 at the deep end is maintained. During peak periods this is increased to 4.0 parts per million at the 6 shallow end in order to obtain 2.0 parts per million at the deep end. A minimum of three samples of the water are taken daily by the Bath Manager's staff for chlorine and pH reading, and from time to time bacteriological testing is carried out by officers from the Public Health Department. At no time during 1962 was the water found to be unsatisfactory for use by swimmers. As this bath is closed during the winter months it can be fully emptied and repaired, if necessary, and cleansed each year before the spring opening. During 1962 the total number of persons using the bath was 18,189 (32,726 in 1961). The average number of persons attending per day was 119. The maximum number at any one session was 350. An indoor swimming bath was opened at North Road School in the latter part of the year for the use of the pupils. Sampling of the water in November produced results that were not satisfactory, and increased and more regular chlorination had to be requested. Paddling Pool A paddling pool for young children is available in Cranleigh Gardens Play Park. The capacity of the pool is approximately 15,500 gallons with depth from 1½ inches to 9 inches. The water of the pool is free-running and is treated by continuous chlorination for hygiene purposes. Like the swimming bath, this pool was in constant and very full use during the summer of 1962. Bacteriological sampling when carried out all proved satisfactory after the two specimens taken in June had given doubtful results and the chlorination had to be increased. School Playing Fields For the physical training, school games and recreation of school children the total acreage of school playing fields in Southall is approximately 20. Two acres of the rather meagre facilities have been lost because of new school building on the Grammar School site. At present considerable use is also made of the play areas within the Council's public parks and negotiations are still proceeding for the acquisition of three further areas of land suitable for playing fields. 7 VITAL STATISTICS Total Deaths, 736. (Males 353; Females 383.) Crude Death Rate, 13.60. For extracts from vital statistics and causes of death, see Appendix, Tables I and II. Deaths and Death Rate The death rate, i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 total population, fell slightly in 1962. Below is shown the comparative figures for the past ten years. Year Death Rate 1953 13.31 1954 12.16 1955 11.92 1956 12.25 1957 13.02 1958 12.04 1959 12.12 1960 13.15 1961 13.63 1962 13.60 The principal causes of death were cancer, coronary disease and heart disease. The figure for cancer deaths rose steeply from 118 in 1960 to 148 in 1961 but in 1962 dropped to 138 and lung cancer accounted for 36 of these (35 male, 1 female)—there were 44 in 1961: the highest number of cancer deaths in 1962 occurred in the alimentary tract, i.e. 39, consisting of 4 sited in the oesophagus, 17 in the stomach, 18 in the intestine. There were no deaths from whooping cough, diphtheria or poliomyelitis, and no deaths attributed to influenza. There were four deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of outside deaths, i.e. of Southall residents who died in Hillingdon Hospital, other Middlesex hospitals and hospitals outside the County boundaries, including various London hospitals, was 296 (males 163 and females 133). Deaths of institution inmates (including patients from Southall addresses and from outside areas) number as follows: St. Bernard's Hospital, 258 (males 89 and females 169); Mount Pleasant Hospital, 43 (males 14 and females 29); Southall-Norwood Hospital, 7 (males 5 and females 2); in addition 2 deaths (male 1 and female 1) occurred of persons belonging to other districts. In 1962, three people died as the result of motor vehicle accidents, as compared with six in 1961 and nine in 1960. The total number of deaths from violent causes was recorded as 24 in 1962 as compared with 28 in 1961 and 39 in 1960. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then, gives a comparative death rate of 12.24 compared with the rate for England and Wales as a whole, which was 11.9. For distribution of deaths in the various wards, see Appendix, Table III. Births and Birth Rate. (Figures for 1961 are given in brackets.) The total number of live births belonging to the district, whether occurring within or outside the district, was 1,065 (973). The illegitimate live births were 99 (80). There were 20 stillbirths (22), 18 legitimate and 2 illegitimate. A rise in the birth rate (live and still) is recorded from 15.58 in 1960 to 18.86 in 1961 and now to 20.05 in 1962. The birth rate is the number of births per 1,000 of the total population. 8 Ninety-nine illegitimate live births were registered during 1962. The following table gives the comparative figures for the past 25 years, showing that 1962 has the highest figure recorded during that period. Year No. of Illegitimate Live Births 1938 31 1939 34 1940 31 1941 30 1942 38 1943 39 1944 55 1945 60 1946 56 1947 53 1948 53 1949 39 1950 36 1951 28 1952 26 1953 31 1954 23 1955 21 1956 38 1957 37 1958 42 1959 55 1960 66 1961 80 1962 99 To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. The corrected live birth rate was 20.47. The corresponding rate for the whole of England and Wales was 18.0; this was the highest national birth rate since the year 1948 and the rate for Southall was well above it. Infant Mortality Infant mortality i.e. the number of children dying before reaching the age of one year, fell slightly in 1962. Twenty-four infants died compared with 26 in 1961, giving a rate of 22.54 compared with 26.72 in 1961. Of these 24 deaths, one died at home and twenty three in hospital. Sixteen infants (seven male and nine female) died within the first four weeks after birth. Table IV gives the causes of infant deaths under the age of one year. Graph A on page 10 shows the trend of the infant mortality rate since 1900. The corresponding rate for Middlesex County was 19.0 and for England and Wales as a whole was 21.4. Premature Infants Eighty-nine premature infants were born alive during the year; 83 were born in hospital and, of these, 75 were surviving at the end of one month; 6 were born at home and all of these were surviving at the end of one month. There were 10 premature still births, all occurring in hospital. The rise in the number of infants born prematurely is out of all proportion to the rise in the birth rate—in two years this figure has doubled and now accounts for nearly one-tenth 9 GRAPH A Infant Mortality Rate From 1900 to 1962 10 of the total number of births; it seems as if a great increase in ante-natal care is urgently necessary to try to eliminate the possible known factors which reduce a mother's ability to carry her infant to term—exhaustion, mental shock and stress, insufficient or unsuitable nourishment, venereal disease, constant drug-taking. Can there be a link between this problem and the increasing inability of mothers to feed their infants naturally? There is need for research here. Comparable figures for the past six years are:— Premature Births Year Born at Home Born in Hospital Births Died within one month Stillbirths Births Died within one month Stillbirths 1957 8 2 _ 40 7 6 1958 8 — — 49 8 3 1959 7 — — 48 6 3 1960 15 — 1 45 7 7 1961 12 1 — 63 17 16 1962 6 — _ 83 8 10 Maternal Morbidity One case of puerperal pyrexia was notified direct to the Department during 1962; in addition 45 cases were notified to other authorities. All of these occurred in Hillingdon Hospital. The classification of puerperal pyrexia is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage." 11 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The number of infectious disease cases notified during 1962 was not great. Apart from a large figure for dysentery (although more than half of these notifications were subsequently cancelled because the bacteriological reports showed no dysentery organisms), 178 measles and one case of typhoid imported from abroad, there was nothing outstanding. See Tables VI and VII on page 64. Details of each disease individually can be found below. Monthly Bulletins of Incidence of Infectious Disease These bulletins were circulated monthly to all general practitioners in the Borough, and, in addition to information with regard to infectious diseases occurring during the previous month, any topical matter, or incident of mutual interest to general practitioners and the Public Health Service, was also included. Poliomyelitis No notifications of anterior Doliomvelitis were received in 1962. Vaccination against poliomyelitis, which is organised by Middlesex County Health Department, continued throughout 1962 and details are as follows:— Number of persons who had received two injections at any time up to 31st December, 1962 19,232 Number of persons who received 3 oral doses. Born in the following years: 1962 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Total 47 206 49 12 19 333 Number of persons who received 2 injections. Born in the following years: 1962 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Total 30 256 130 132 239 787 Number of persons who received 3 injections. Born in the following years: 1962 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Total 1 52 461 254 759 1,527 261 school children between the ages of 5 and 12 were given a fourth injection. 680 school children between the ages of 5 and 12 were given a boost dose of oral vaccine after 3 injections. Number of persons who received an oral boost after 2 injections. Born in the following years: 1961 1943-1960 1933-1942 Others Total 140 345 102 234 821 12 Of those previously obtaining two injections, by the end of December, 17,084 had received a third injection. Measles Measles incidence was not heavy during the year 1962 and there were no deaths from this cause. The following table shows the trend of notifications during the past ten years. Year No. of Cases Deaths 1953 931 1 1954 41 — 1955 1,329 — 1956 61 — 1957 674 1 1958 476 — 1959 674 - 1960 12 - 1961 1,042 1 1962 178 - Influenza Influenza was not a serious problem in 1962. There were no deaths during the year attributable to influenza. Dysentery Two hundred and thirty notifications for dysentery were received in 1962. In October, a woman who had been in hospital for treatment was discharged home while still a carrier of Sonne Dysentery. The Public Health Department was not informed of this and the result was an outbreak of this disease in Featherstone Road Infants School, Southall. In spite of speedy tracking of contacts and immediate exclusion from school of suspects, and in spite of the incessant and careful watch on hygiene within the school by the members of the staff, 37 children developed the illness in that school and a further 20 in other schools. Eight hundred and ninety one faeces specimens of patients and contacts were taken—in total 100 positive cases were found and treated. We were very fortunate in being able to contain the disease into a small area of the Borough, and it was noteworthy that cases did not occur among our Indian population who are more careful about their personal cleanliness when handling food. Many notifications were not confirmed bacteriologically. Smallpox Vaccination 1962 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 440 145 386 2,294 2,615 5,880 Re-vaccination 3 24 311 1,892 5,021 7,251 1961 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 449 52 38 41 75 655 Re-Vaccination — — 4 6 119 129 The figures for smallpox vaccination rose sensationally because of the fact of the entry of smallpox cases into this country in the first months of the year. There was an immediate 13 clamour for mass vaccination which was not encouraged, first attention having to be given to persons likely to have been at first or second contact with any cases of the disease. To help general practitioners a daily transport service of vaccine from the laboratory was managed from the Public Health Department, and as this Borough was in rather a special position because of its nearness to London Airport and its considerable immigrant population, some of whom were from Karachi whence the infection was spreading, it was reasonable to try to obtain a highly vaccinated population at a time when vaccination was freely acceptable by the citizens. In addition some special facilities were offered at County Clinics for vaccination. International certificates of smallpox vaccination for the use of travellers abroad require to be authenticated in the Public Health Deparment and towards summer a great increase in the demand for this service was experienced, particularly as many European countries demanded this proof of vaccination before permitting entry. Sixty-five persons were notified between January and April as being contacts of smallpox cases; these were traced and, if remaining in the Borough, checked for or given vaccination and kept under surveillance, while the addresses of those who had passed on to other areas were obtained and other Medical Officers of Health informed. No case of smallpox developed in Southall. Typhoid Fever A case of this disease was discovered in a man, in hospital for another reason. He was treated and discharged from hospital as a chronic carrier, probably of long standing, but not previously discovered. He moved at the end of the year to another district. Scarlet Fever (Scarlatina) The number of notifications received during the year was 19 as compared with 27 in 1961 and 42 in 1960. There were no secondary cases. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria were notified to the Department. The following information supplied by the Area Medical Officer shows the number of children immunised against diphtheria during the year. Number of Children who completed a full course of Primary Immunisation in Southall during the year Number of Children who were given Secondary or Reinforcing Injection during the year (i.e. having in a previous year received a complete full course) Ages at Date of Final Injection Under 1 1-4 5-14 Total 295 217 10 522 327 There was a heavy drop in the figures for immunisation against Diphtheria during the year—from 984 in 1961 to 522 in 1962. The absence of headline news concerning cases of diphtheria seems to let the public forget how swift and deadly this disease can be and that a lifetime's regret is a heavy price to pay for indolence with regard to obtaining protection. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No cases of ophthalmia neonatorum were notified during the year. Tuberculosis Notifications Pulmonary The number of notifications received during the year was 59. 14 Other Forms The number of notifications received during the year was 12. Of the total notifications, which include new cases and inward transfers from other districts, 54 were received from the Uxbridge Chest Clinic; 5 from General Hospitals; 8 from St. Bernard's Hospital and 4 from General Practitioners. The number of new notifications fell from 89 in 1961 to 71 in 1962. Of the 71, 31 were inward transfers, i.e. they were not resident in Southall at the time of development of the disease and, therefore, the actual figure of new notifications of Southall residents was 40, three of which were subsequently diagnosed as non-tuberculous; while in 1961 the number of inward transfers was 22, making the figure for new notifications of Southall residents 67, less one subsequently cancelled. Deaths Tuberculosis of the respiratory system, 4; other forms, nil. For details of new cases notified and deaths in 1962, see Appendix, Table VIII, and for the occupation of new cases, see Appendix, Table IX. The notification figures showed a drop in 1962, pulmonary cases being 15 less and nonpulmonary 3 less than in the previous year. Graph B shows the progress of notifications and deaths since 1930. There were four deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with one in 1961. The amount of tuberculosis amongst Indian residents fell greatly in 1962, comparative figures for the last six years are:— Year New Cases Number of Indians 1962 40 12* 1961 67 29 1960 47 13 1959 64 12 1958 57 14 1957 61 10 *Two subsequently not confirmed as Tuberculosis The analysis of the housing conditions of newly notified cases shows that 30 lived in houses, 3 in flats, 23 in lodgings; information was not available with regard to the other 15 cases for various reasons: one was an inward transfer who was really a recovered case, two cases subsequently not confirmed, ten cases notified from St. Bernard's Hospital, one returned to Ireland and another removed to Buckinghamshire. Of the 56 cases above, ten were inward transfers, i.e. had not contracted the disease in Southall. There were 8 cases living in overcrowded homes, 7 Indians and one West Indian. Two of the Indians removed during the year, thus abating overcrowding. In four instances there were multiple cases, one in an English home, two in Indian homes and one in an Irish home. Statutory overcrowding was confirmed in one of these houses. The number of patients was two in three cases, and three in one case. Of three cases of overcrowding with tuberculosis in 1961, abatement had occurred in one instance, overcrowding was still existing in the other two. In one instance from 1960 of dilapidated housing with tuberculosis, no rehousing had taken place by the end of the year. Management of Tuberculosis For diagnostic purposes, Southall patients are mostly referred either by general practitioners or from hospital doctors to the Uxbridge Chest Clinic, and if tuberculosis is found, treatment and following-up is instituted from that Clinic. The Tuberculosis Visitor calls 15 Graph B Tuberculosis (All Forms)—Notifications and Deaths from 1930 to 1962. 16 at the home of a patient and submits a copy of her report to the Public Health Department. Contacts are seen by the Visitor and they have suitable tests, either tuberculin tests or X-rays, or both, at the Chest Clinic. If sanitary defects or overcrowding are reported further visiting is carried out from the Public Health Department. At St. Bernard's Hospital, cases of tuberculosis are isolated in Adelaide Ward, which has 24 male and 24 female beds. One of the doctors from Uxbridge Chest Clinic continues to carry out tuberculin testing and B.C.G. vaccination of members of the nursing staff of the hospital. B.C.G. Vaccination B.C.G. vaccination is offered to contacts of cases of tuberculosis, to medical and nursing staffs of tuberculosis wards, and since 1957, as a result of the findings of the Medical Research Council in their Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial, to children aged 13 and over in Southall schools. Testing with tuberculin is carried out beforehand. The tuberculin test, if positive, shows that infection has occurred at some time during life, and further investigation is undertaken to verify whether this is active, chronic or healed infection, as these all give the same result to the test. When the tuberculin test is negative and in the absence of disease, B.C.G. inoculations are carried out in order to render the individuals tuberculin positive and, therefore, to have immunity to infection by the tuberculous bacillus. Details of work on Southall contacts during 1961 and 1962 at Uxbridge Chest Clinic are as follows:— 1961 Under 1 year l-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Grand Total Tuberculin tests—Positive result - 2 10 28 40 153 * - 2 27 84 113 Tuberculin tests—Negative result 21 24 16 8 69 110 * 11 13 11 6 41 B.C.G. given 21 24 16 8 69 110 * 11 13 11 6 41 B.C.G. given—Babies born in hospital 4 *Indians and Pakistanis 1962 Under 1 year 1-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Grand Total Tuberculin tests—Positive result * 2 2 3 5 12 269 — 3 6 248 257 Tuberculin tests—Negative result * 18 16 20 8 62 143 8 15 3 55 81 B.C.G. given * 18 16 20 8 62 104 8 15 3 16 42 B.C.G. given—Babies born in hospital 17 •Indians and Pakistanis Under the B.C.G. vaccination in schools scheme, details are as follows:— Number invited to take part in scheme Number of consents received Referred to Chest Clinic Number of Children vaccinated with B.C.G. Contacts Positives 521 412 3 80 256 All testing and vaccinating during 1962 under this scheme was carried out in Southall by the Middlesex County Council Staff. 17 Mass X-ray The mobile Mass X-ray Unit visited certain organised groups in Southall during 1962, and also paid a longer visit during the summer to include public sessions. The following numbers were X-rayed:— A.E.C. 1,168 Manor House 1,976 Quaker Oats 152 Abbott Bros. 116 G. Wimpey, Toplocks Depot 167 Hygrade Containers, Hanwell 369 Crown Cork 378 British Railways Hostel 99 Kearley & Tonge 685 H. G. Sanders 174 James Davies 116 Cramic Engineering 487 Lady Margaret Road 320 The Wolf, Norwood Green 245 Manor House 1,079 St. Bernard's Hospital 1,900 9,431 Southall residents: 6,723 Cases of active P.T. 5 (Southall residents 4) Cases for observation 9 (Southall residents 6) Cases of bronchial carcinoma 6 (Southall residents 6) It will be seen that a considerable survey of St. Bernard's Hospital patients and staff was also carried out with the purpose of detecting any latent tuberculosis particularly amongst long-stay patients. New staff is subject to X-ray examination on entry to the service. There is now available at the West Middlesex Hospital a static Mass X-ray Unit, the second to be introduced in Middlesex, and while primarily intended for the use of hospital patients, there is an open invitation for any member of the public to attend, at any time when the Unit is working, for a check. This is a most useful undertaking and supplements the work done during the visit of the Mobile Unit to Southall. It also saves the need, in most cases, of reference by appointment to the Chest X-ray Clinic for a large film to be taken. Dr. J. T. Nicol Roe, Chest Physician, Uxbridge Chest Clinic, reports on the need for continued aggressive action in detecting the new case of pulmonary tuberculosis, for only by so doing and treating this case effectively will diminution of new cases be maintained. The continued co-operation of local General Practitioners in referring to the Chest Clinic newly arrived Indians and their families for X-rays and/or Tuberculin testing is an essential part of the anti-tuberculosis programme. Patients in the Southall area, as before, are admitted to Harefield Hospital. Dr. Nicol Roe considers it is still a desirable thing for anti-tuberculous drugs to be initiated in hospital, as a certain risk always exists towards the development of sensitivity reactions. Of the Indians and Pakistanis who were referred to the clinic by their general prac titioners for X-ray only, the following were skin tested and B.C.G. vaccinated:— Under 1 year 1-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Tested 8 18 9 303 338 Negative 8 15 3 55 81 Positive — 3 6 248 257 Vaccinated 8 15 3 16 42 18 With regard to prevention and early detection of cases, contacts both at home and factory or workshop should have regular X-rays and/or Tuberculin Tests. Full use should continue to be made of the Mass X-ray Unit's visits to the Borough. Cancer It will be seen by the table of causes of death (page 62) that in 1962 138 cases (males 75 and females 63) died from cancer. See Appendix, Table V, for an analysis of cancer deaths since 1936. On page 20 is set out in tabular form a classification of the cancer deaths according to the site of the primary growth and in ages. The total number of deaths from cancer in 1962 fell, being 138 as compared with 148 in 1961. Cancer of the lung in males was the highest individual figure for site of disease but was lower than in 1961, i.e. 36 (35 males, 1 female) compared with 44 (39 males, 5 females) in the previous year. Distribution of Infectious Disease Notifications For the incidence of various infectious diseases notified during the year, under age groups and locality, see Appendix, Tables VI and VII. Infectious Disease Visits During the year, the Public Health Inspectors paid 478 visits with reference to cases of infectious disease. In addition, the County Health Visitors did a certain amount of home and school visiting in connection with infectious diseases. Laboratory Work Specimens taken for bacteriological or chemical investigations, in connection particularly with infectious disease cases, are brought daily to the Manor House and transported to the Ealing Public Health Laboratory. The necessary investigations are carried out and results reported simultaneously to the Medical Officer of Health and to the doctor who has submitted the specimens from one of his patients. Details of the work carried out in 1962 are as follows:— Faeces specimens 957 Sputum specimens 6 Blood specimens 15 Urine specimens 56 Swabs (nose, throat, aural and vaginal) 22 Vaginal smears 1 Disinfection and Disinfestation In cases of infectious disease, rooms, clothing, etc., were disinfected—rooms by sealing and fumigating with a formalin preparation; clothing, bedding and other infected articles remaining in the room for disinfection. Lists of premises, articles, etc., disinfected during the year:— Rooms 15 Books 79 Beds 12 Eiderdowns 12 Blankets 36 Pillows 38 Sheets 24 Lists of premises disinfested from vermin during the year:— Bug infestation 16 rooms with beds and bedding Flea infestation 32 rooms with beds and bedding Cockroach infestation 10 rooms Lice 5 rooms Carpet beetles 19 rooms Woodworm 2 rooms Ants 4 rooms In addition, 8 wasps nests were destroyed. 19 CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER DEATHS IN SITES AND AGES Age Groups—Male Site Total Under 10 10-20 20—30 30—40 40—50 50-60 60-70 70-80 80+ '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 Lung 33 31 28 39 35 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 - - - - 2 1 3 3 4 12 15 11 6 8 7 8 9 20 14 8 7 5 10 9 1 - - - - Stomach 16 13 9 13 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 4 3 1 2 2 5 5 3 2 1 6 5 5 8 2 1 - - 1 - Intestine 13 6 7 6 7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 1 - - 2 2 1 1 2 7 2 3 3 3 2 - - 2 1 1 1 2 - 1 Bladder 3 5 - 3 7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 2 - - 1 1 2 - 2 3 1 1 - 1 3 - - - - - Prostate 4 2 6 9 4 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 - 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 3 1 - 1 1 2 1 Other 22 8 20 19 17 - - - - 1 - - - 1 1 1 - - - - 2 - 2 - 1 1 2 3 1 2 6 2 5 6 4 3 3 7 4 7 7 - 1 4 - 1 1 2 3 1 Totals 91 65 70 89 75 - - - - 1 1 - 1 1 1 - - - - 5 - 2 - 1 4 4 7 4 6 25 24 19 17 17 25 20 24 33 30 26 14 13 28 16 4 3 5 6 3 Age Groups—Female Site Total Under 10 10-20 20-30 30—40 40—50 50—60 60-70 70—80 80 + '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 •59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 '58 '59 '60 '61 '62 Breast 10 5 8 15 13 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - 2 2 3 3 1 5 6 2 - 2 - 3 2 4 - - 1 2 3 2 1 3 3 Lung 5 5 3 5 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 2 - 1 1 1 - 3 2 3 - 2 1 - 1 - 1 - - - - Stomach 5 9 6 8 12 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 1 2 1 1 2 3 1 4 2 2 2 1 6 2 4 - 3 1 Uterus 1 2 3 4 3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - 2 - 1 3 2 - - - - 1 - Intestine 8 11 9 8 11 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 1 3 - 1 2 1 1 3 3 2 6 3 5 4 2 - 1 3 - 1 3 Bladder - 1 - 3 3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - 1 - - 2 - - - 2 - Other 19 17 19 16 20 - - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 - - - - 1 3 1 - - 6 6 2 1 4 3 4 5 3 7 4 2 7 6 4 4 1 4 5 5 Totals 48 50 48 59 63 - - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 - - 1 1 1 4 4 3 5 14 9 10 13 9 6 14 13 13 22 15 12 16 13 14 11 10 5 15 12 20 Smallpox Disinfection In the event of smallpox occurring within the district and disinfection being required on a considerable scale, arrangements have been made whereby this could be carried out. An agreement was made with the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board whereby in such an event the staff of St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, would carry out this work. Provision of Antitoxin and Vaccine Lymph The Council provides diphtheria antitoxin free to local practitioners in the district. This antitoxin is obtainable from the Public Health Department during office hours and by direct request to the Medical Officer of Health at other times. In the event of emergency supplies of vaccine lymph being required, they are obtainable at very short notice. Scabies and Lice During 1962, no cases of scabies were brought to the notice of the Department, but 12 cases of head lice from two families required to have treatment. Baths and treatment were arranged at Hammersmith Cleansing Station by courtesy of Hammersmith Borough Council. Three members of one of these families required treatment again during the year, also three members from another family. In addition, three more persons received treatment for head lice and two for body lice. The lesults of the routine school surveys of cleanliness in 1962 are not good; the number inspected was very little greater than in 1961 but the number requiring treatment was three times as great, and compulsory cleansing was needed for twice as many. Some parents do not seem to experience the shame and horror of this type of infestation which is the normal reaction of good parents, and infestation recurs over and over again in members of some families in spite of all efforts made by the authorities. Such families can only be cleared by having all the members treated at the same time along with disinfestation of clothing and bedding. Treatment of school children is normally carried out in the ordinary Middlesex County Council Clinics. Details of head inspections in schools are to be found in Table X, page 67. 21 WELFARE General St. John Ambulance Association: The local headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Association are situated at Harrington Road, Southall. There are 23 Nursing Members, 4 Officers, 2 N.C.O.s (Nursing) and 11 Auxiliary Members. The work carried out is as follows:— Home Nursing and Nursing Equipment. The St. John Ambulance Nursing Division has been trained in Home Nursing and First Aid to the Injured. It also lends nursing equipment for use in the home from the Medical Comforts Depot in Hartington Road, open every evening (except Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays) from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. for the issue of articles needed by the public. During the year 292 articles were lent under the scheme—the 1961 figure was 286. Seven members belong to the National Hospital Service Reserve. Welfare—General. The St. John Ambulance Brigade carried out trainings in First Aid and Home Nursing for all who cared to take advantage of the service, also special courses for Civil Defence volunteers and for Scouts and Guides. The members of the Nursing and Ambulance Divisions carried out many other duties including attendance at local cinemas, sports, fairs, Old Folks' Clubs, accompanying old people's group excursions to the seaside, hospital duties, also sick visiting. Members also took part in duties further afield, including London Airport, London theatres, concerts, etc. The amount of voluntary time given to this good work is considerable. During 1962, 1,199 hours were spent on public duties, and 254 on miscellaneous duties. British Red Cross Society: The Southall Division of the British Red Cross Society continued to increase in membership during 1962. Courses in First Aid, Nursing and Maternal and Child Welfare were given. The Juniors, amongst their duties, included hospital work, and the two Girls' Cadet units continued to grow. The Handcraft Club for the Disabled increased its membership, and, once again, its members won many prizes in the Handicrafts section of the Southall Show in August. There were various outings during the year for these handicapped people. Other activities of the local Red Cross included escort duties, medical loan depot, visiting, all clerical work connected with, and attendance at, Blood Donor sessions, emergency help for disabled ex-Servicemen, the almoning of grants from various organisations and charities, first aid duties at the local rugby football ground, the Royal Festival Hall and school functions, and assistance as "casualties" and "casualty fakers" at the Civil Defence exercises at the Hayes training ground. A valuable section of the Division, apart from the uniformed V.A.D. members, is that of the ordinary members, who help in many ways, other than medical or training ones. They undertake regular escort duties, money-raising activities, and help with the Handcraft Club for the Disabled each week. Club for Disabled Persons: A Club, for persons suffering from severe disablement, met fortnightly and was a social and recreational one for people suffering from any physical handicap. Transport was provided by members of the Rotary Club and Round Table for those members who were unable to make their own way to the Club premises, which were at the Southall Community Centre. The membership declined during 1962 to 9, members transferring to the Red Cross Disabled Club (see above). 22 The Hard of Hearing Club: This Club, which was inaugurated in 1955, had another successful year in 1962 and continued to be popular and useful to its members. The membership figure remained static. There was an average weekly attendance of 35. The officers and committee have been exceedingly busy, and the programmes continued to be educational, entertaining and also helpful to the members in their endeavour to overcome and live with their disability. The Welfare Officer has done much work, helping not only Group members, but people in the Borough who required help with hearing-aids, etc. Six members attended the Old Age Pensioners' Holiday at Dymchurch organised by the Welfare Committee of the Middlesex and Surrey League, and the group was represented at the National Conferences of the British Association for the Hard of Hearing. Diabetic Club: The Southall and District Diabetic Club, a Branch of the British Diabetic Association, continued to function throughout 1962. This Club, formed in 1956, aims to enable diabetics, their relatives and friends, and those interested in diabetic welfare, to meet together socially to have more general discussions, and to hear authoritative talks from speakers who specialise or are particularly interested in diabetes such as doctors and other health and nutrition experts. Membership by subscription was 65, with a Club Newsletter circulation of 118. The attendance at monthly meetings in the Masons Room of the Holy Trinity Hall averaged 26. The Club has a Committee of 11 members which includes two welfare officers and organisers of various fund-raising activities in aid of the Research Fund of the British Diabetic Association. The Club programme in 1962 included talks on health, food and special subjects, social evenings, a coach outing to Eastbourne, as well as talks by diabetic specialists. The Club is a member of the North-West Metropolitan Region which consists of 7 Branches in West London, and inter-club visits are organised. Multiple Sclerosis Society: The West London Branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society has six Southall members, and others are attached to the new West Middlesex Branch of the same Society. The Branches arrange social events with transport, and there is much individual help, visiting and advice given to each member. Meetings are held at St. Paul's Hall, South Ealing, and St. Mary's Hall, Bedfont. Swimming is arranged every Saturday at Hounslow Baths; telephone installation and help with provision of clothing or other needs were arranged for individual patients. In addition, a new Branch of this Society was formed during 1961 to meet the needs of sufferers from this disability in the Boroughs of Southall, Heston and Isleworth, Hayes and Harlington, and Uxbridge. It was named the West Middlesex Branch. The work undertaken by this Society includes the visiting of disabled members in their homes, the organisation of social meetings with provision of transport for members, the provision of financial help for holidays, telephone installation, clothing or other needs. Spas tics Welfare Society: The Central Middlesex Spastics Welfare Society does much work for spastics in an area which includes Southall, and which at the present time has a number of sufferers from this affliction who live in Southall under its care. The Society is very active in making charitable appeals to benefit its work at its Works Centre, South Ruislip, where 30 young men and women are employed on sub-contract work for local firms doing light engineering, printing, and other light work; other activities include a Social Club held once a month at Perivale. Home-work for the homebound spastics, a day by the sea in the summer, and in special circumstances help with holidays or other welfare needs may be arranged by the Spastics Society. 23 Women's Voluntary Service: The Women's Voluntary Service is very active in Southall, and amongst the many services given by its members the following are particularly connected with Welfare:— Clerical work in all three clinics in Southall; provision of a Trolley Shop in both Southall-Norwood and Mount Pleasant Hospitals; issue of batteries for deaf aids in Southall Hospital; making out-patients' teas on clinic days in Southall Hospital; taking the telephone trolley round Southall Hospital for patients' use; help in the X-ray department with the filing at Southall Hospital; issue of Welfare Foods from W.V.S. Office. Welfare of the Blind and Partially Sighted: The Welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted are the responsibility of the County Council under the National Assistance Act, 1948. In 1962 there were resident in the Borough 88 blind and 17 partially-sighted persons. There were 3 partially-sighted children attending Special Schools, and 1 blind child aged 4 years, at home. Eleven blind persons were in full-time employment. Of these, 2 were in Workshops for the Blind, and 1 was working as a Home Worker. The earnings of these 3 persons were augmented by the County Council. The County Council's Welfare Department provides a Home Teaching service, the object of which is to enable blind and partially-sighted people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows, by assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities. The majority of blind persons are either not capable of employment owing to age or infirmity, or for some reason are not available for employment. Amongst the latter are housewives who may receive instruction in carrying out their household duties from the Home Teachers or in residential courses of social rehabilitation. The Home Teachers visit all blind and partially-sighted persons in their own homes, in hospitals and in residential homes, advise on all problems relating to their welfare and keep them in touch with available social services. They give instruction in Braille and Moon systems of embossed type, and in handicrafts. Deaf-Blind persons also receive the services of a special Home Teacher for the Deaf-Blind. A handicraft class is held fortnightly at the King's Hall Methodist Church, South Road, Southall. Close co-operation is maintained between the County Council and Voluntary Organisations, including the Social Club for the Blind, which holds fortnightly meetings at the Labour Hall, The Broadway, Southall, and the Middlesex Association for the Blind, which assists individual necessitous blind people and maintains a holiday home at Littlehampton, two holiday caravans at Lancing, and two Residential Homes for the Blind. The Southall Blind Club has a membership of 32 with an average age of 73, and transport to Club meetings is carried out by members of Southall Round Table and Inner Wheel. The Club is social and in 1962 also ran two coach outings and a Christmas party. Blind persons are eligible for the loan of a wireless receiver through the British "Wireless for the Blind" Fund, and the County Council has a scheme for assisting blind and partially-sighted persons with the maintenance of wireless sets. Other services are provided by the County Council either directly or through a registered agency and these include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handicraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handicrafts and assisted holidays for those in need. Welfare of Handicapped Persons other than Blind: Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially-sighted which are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948, provide welfare services for the deaf and dumb and hard-of-hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by disease, injury or congenital deformity. Services to the deaf-and-dumb and the hard-of-hearing are provided by appropriate Voluntary Organisations, to which the County Council makes grants in aid. 24 The Borough of Southall forms part of Area 9, which includes also the Boroughs of Brentford and Chiswick, and Heston and Isleworth. Two Welfare Visitors and a Homework Organiser are included in the staff which has been provided by the County Council's Welfare Department for carrying out social services required, and who visit those suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps. They work from the Local Area Welfare Office and the handicapped persons are visited in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain services from statutory or voluntary sources. The County Council supplies aids and appliances not covered by the National Health Services and carries out where necessary adaptations to a house to enable a handicapped person to become more mobile, provides holidays, arranges for the disabled to take part in social activities, including choral and dancing classes, attend handicraft classes, etc. Special coaches with a hydraulic hoist to lift wheelchair cases are available for use for social activities, etc. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given and membership of voluntary organisations catering for particular handicaps is facilitated. The Home Work Organiser endeavours to procure from industry appropriate assembly work and arranges for this to be carried out by handicapped persons at a Work Centre or in their own homes where this is considered to be suitable and of assistance to the individuals concerned. At 31st December, 1962, 92 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped. Alterations to eight houses to make them more suitable for handicapped persons were made as follows:— Flat: House: Rail by toilet and ramp at front door. House: Bath hand rail. Flat: Rails by front door and toilet. Flat: Rail by toilet and ramp at front door. Flat: House Base for shed for invalid carriage and crossover for kerb. House: Rail by bath and on stairs. Under the County provision of Chiropody Service, one physically handicapped person received one domiciliary chiropody treatment in 1962. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. J. F.

Nutrition of School Children: The following figures kindly supplied by the Divisional Education Officer give the details of milk and meals acceptance in the various schools in the Borough. The percentage of children having milk in schools was as follows:— School 1960 1961 1962 Primary 96% 96% 96% Secondary Modern 72% 73% 72% Technical Grammar Technical in 1962 75% 67% 52% Grammar 39% 53% Talbot Special 83.5% 87% 78% The percentage of meals served to daily attendances during the Autumn Term gives a guide to the use being made of the School Meals Service during the year. 25 School Autumn Term Average % of Attendance taking meals Average Number taking meals Average attendance 1962 1961 1962 1961 1962 1961 Primary Schools: Beaconsfield Road Junior Mixed 39 40 114 118 294 294 Beaconsfield Road Infants' 51 42 95 82 186 196 Clifton Road Junior Mixed 43 46 70 67 163 146 Clifton Road Infants' 45 43 65 51 144 119 Dormers Wells Junior Mixed 65 61 131 124 201 203 Dormers Wells Infants' 61 66 88 89 144 134 Featherstone Road Junior Mixed 44 41 126 118 284 289 Featherstone Road Infants' 46 45 98 103 215 228 George Tomlinson Junior Mixed 69 65 120 141 173 216 George Tomlinson Infants' 45 50 45 58 101 115 Lady Margaret Junior Mixed 54 55 166 161 309 291 Lady Margaret Infants' 46 42 107 91 235 215 North Road Junior Mixed & Infants' 56 55 222 213 396 384 St. Anselm's R.C. 79 77 306 302 386 393 Tudor Road Junior Mixed 41 47 138 146 334 312 Tudor Road Infants' 41 35 80 70 196 201 Secondary Schools: Southall Grammar - 57 - 343 - 597 Southall Grammar/Technical 48 -† 417 —† 871 —† Dormers Wells Boys' 39 37 191 203 487 549 Dormers Wells Girls' 59 56 281 287 474 513 Featherstone Road Boys' 38 44 233 273 621 615 Western Road Girls' 49 45 209 198 428 437 Grammar/Technical* — 37 — 126 — 339 Special Schools: Talbot Road 100 97 203 204 203 210 *Dudley Road Annexe only. †No comparative figure available because of the amalgamation of the Southall Grammar and the Southall Technical Schools during 1962. It is interesting and pleasing to report an annual increase in the percentage of children taking school meals:— Year Autumn Term 1958 43.69 1959 46.51 1960 50.67 1961 50.95 1962 51.21 26 Old People The needs of 20 special cases of old people living in difficult circumstances were investigated during 1962, and what happened to them is recorded in the following list:— Admitted to hospital 3 Admitted to old people's home - Remaining at home 17 (a) Rehoused 1 (,b) Home Help and District Nurse provided 2 (c) Home Help and meals provided 1 (id) Repairs to house awaited 2 (e) Awaiting housing for old people 5 (/) Awaiting old people's home admission 1 (g) No action required 2 (h) Chiropody 1 (f) National Assistance arranged 1 (j) Medical attendance and extra equipment provided 1 The difficulties of the old persons recorded on this list were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff either by medical practitioners, interested relations, neighbours or friends, or following complaint by one or other of the statutory authorities. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them; and it can do this by providing its own homes or by arrangements with recognised voluntary organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department administers the County homes, and the number of persons admitted to such homes from the Borough in 1962 was 19, only one of whom had been previously brought to our attention in 1961. It has been ascertained from the Area Medical Officer that 420 Southall people were given home help during the year, and of these 356 consisted of chronic sick or aged persons, and of 871 persons who were assisted by the home nurses, 341 were of age 65 or over, 118 male and 223 female. Many voluntary associations contributed to provide Christmas parcels or special comforts for old people. Meals on Wheels Service: During the year mid-day meals on four days per week were provided for house-bound old people in need of the service. In 1962, 16,506 meals were delivered, an increase of 3,352 over the 1961 figure. One hundred and ninety-eight old persons were assisted by means of this scheme during the year. The maximum number of old people receiving the meals on any one day was 93, so that both vans were working to capacity on many occasions. Special Christmas dinners (frozen pack) were delivered to 96 people and also to them went 96 special parcels to cover the Christmas period when meals were not being delivered. Chiropody Service for Old People: This service was continued throughout 1962. Five local chiropodists gave their services at cheap rates for Old Age Pensioners. In 1962, Middlesex County Officers were empowered to proceed with a scheme for the increase in the provision of chiropody as part of the County Health Services and 68 old age pensioners had attention during the year at the Northcote Avenue Clinic, the number of attendances by them at the Clinic being 343. The County Council was able also to offer financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing chiropody, and the Southall Old People's Welfare Committee reported the number of treatments given during the year under this scheme to be 1,222, i.e., treatments at surgeries 27 761, and visits to homebound 461. The number of Old Age Pensioners receiving treatment under this scheme was 259. The County Council made provision for a limited amount of domiciliary service from 26th October, 1962. One Old Age Pensioner was given 6 treatments under this provision. Holidays for Old People: The holiday scheme whereby old people get a seaside holiday during off-season months of May and September, at reduced rates, continued during 1962 and was operated by the various Old People's Clubs in the Borough. In addition, the Southall Old People's Welfare Association sent 20 Old Age Pensioners for one week's free holiday by the sea. Two day outings were arranged by this Association for 40 elderly housebound, and two afternoon and evening outings to Southend by coach were arranged for 76 persons. Clubs for Old People: Old Age Pensioners Federation—Southall Branch: This Club had a membership of 150 and met once a week on Monday afternoons for social purposes, the average attendance being about 125. Seaside outings were arranged on five occasions during the summer, also a Christmas party. St. Anselm's "Over Sixties" Club: St. Anselm's "Over Sixties" Club continued under the auspices of the Southall Section of the Catholic Women's League, but members of any religion were welcomed. There were about 160 members in 1962, with an average weekly attendance of 125 to 130 at the Tuesday meetings. There was usually an entertainment or film-show each week, with refreshments provided for 2d. per person. During the year there were four free outings to the seaside, and a visit to a London pantomime. Parties were held for the Club's 6th Birthday in October, and at Christmas, when parcels were distributed. Sick members are visited, birthdays remembered with cards and small gifts, and this Club, like others in Southall, is offered free tickets for concerts, etc., by various organisations from time to time. The Silverthreads Group: This Club had a membership of 150, meeting once a week on Thursdays at the Community Centre, with an average attendance of 95. The Club is a social one, and entertainment was provided for the members each week. There were two coach outings, a birthday party, a Christmas party and a harvest festival also arranged. The Darby and Joan Club: This Club met weekly and had a membership in 1962 of 66, with an average attendance at each meeting of about 50. The meetings were social, entertainment being provided and refreshments. Summer outings and Christmas parties were arranged. The Allenby Old Age Pensioners Club: This Club met weekly on Wednesdays, had a membership of 152, with an average attendance of over 100. The Club is social, and entertainment and refreshments were provided at each meeting. Five seaside outings were arranged by this Club, the organiser of which takes a special pride in the facts that the Club is entirely self-supporting, and that a small orchestra has been formed by members of the Club. The United Old Folks Club: The average attendance at this Club was 170-200. Meetings were once a week on Mondays and these were social with entertainment provided. The members had free outings to the seaside, including one special visit to the sea for the elderly housebound. A Christmas party, Christmas parcels and gifts for the sick were also provided from this Club and a free pantomime outing. 28 St. John's Church Old Folks Club: This is a social Club with entertainments and outings and the average attendance at the weekly meeting was 45. Other Services: A service for the provision of cheap laundry and a cheap boot and shoe service are available for Old Age Pensioners. The North Thames Gas Board offers a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of Old Age Pensioners living alone. The reason for this is to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer includes free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. To take advantage of this offer, lists of old people living alone are submitted from the Public Health Department and in due course the homes of the person nominated on the lists are visited by the Gas Board Officers. Fresh lists continued to be supplied from time to time. A visiting library service for old people who were housebound was started early in 1959 —operated by the Southall Old People's Welfare Committee, and with distribution assisted by various young people's groups. This has proved to be a very successful scheme, not only because the elderly obtain reading material without effort, but because the voluntary visitors, who include young people from the Girl Guides, give pleasure by their interest in the old people. Southall Association for the Occupation of the Elderly: The Work Centre for the Elderly situated in the Municipal Sports Ground, and maintained by a voluntary association supported in part by Middlesex County Council and Southall Borough Council, continued to operate throughout 1962. Various types of simple work were carried out by the old people in quite a satisfactory way; indeed, as the firms supplying the work were expected to pay the proper rate for work, it was essential that the work should be completed to their satisfaction. The number of workers at the end of the year was 50, and various types of work were carried out, carding buttons, trimming and stamping of metal bolts, trimming of rubber, sorting of porcelain fittings, etc., and the old people could be put on the jobs which were most suited to their capabilities. Any Old Age Pensioner is eligible to apply for work under this scheme and once taken on is kept on whether his or her output can be considered significant or not. It is realised by the workers that a flat rate of 10/- per week for a ten hour week is certainly much less than the younger healthy pensioner would be able to obtain in the labour market, but they also realise that as they grow older or ill and less able to do very much work this wage will continue the same. The scheme can never become self-supporting, but it is showing great benefits in the social and even physical well-being of the people who are working. There is a very happy atmosphere in the work rooms. Cups of tea are provided during the morning and afternoon sessions. A second Work Centre is planned to commence working in the Autumn of 1963 to serve the southern end of the Borough. National Assistance Act, 1948, section 47: National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951: No case was dealt with under these powers during 1962. 29 HEALTH EDUCATION Continuous education of the people in the method and importance of healthy living was carried on throughout the year by means of individual conversations, during visits to homes for any reason by any member of the staff of the Public Health Department; by means of the display of topical posters on health hazards; by means of the issue of handbills and leaflets. A considerable amount of publicity was given to the visit of the Mass X-ray Unit in the summer when newspaper notices and advertisements, and the display of two large banners on the Town Hall and at the busy crossing at the Iron Bridge, were added to the handbill and poster publicity. Leaflets were also distributed through the post to every house in the Borough on this occasion. In Southall for many years we have been able to claim that the incidence of infectious disease, and of the dirt diseases, was good compared with Regional and National figures, but to keep dysentery and food poisoning at bay has meant that incessant vigilance over the handling of food and insistence in propaganda in personal cleanliness has been necessary. Facilities for the washing of hands in places where the public congregate to eat meals and in the public conveniences of the Borough are reasonably good and improving constantly, but all the washbasins in the world are of no avail to prevent contamination if the people will not use them, and this is one of the hardest tasks of the health educator. In this an excellent example is given to the population as a whole by the Indian citizens, to whom ritual hand washing before the handling of food is a practice from earliest childhood. Carelessness in this respect can at any time bring disaster in the form of intestinal disease, which, however transitory, detracts from perfect health and can have debilitating effects tending to lower the resistance of the body to more serious illness. The problems of the increase of Venereal Disease and drug taking are difficult ones, and health education must be directed more to these evils, which are social diseases of considerable importance. As health educators the staff of the Public Health Department have to deal with these matters purely on health grounds, avoiding the moral issues, but there is no difficulty in pointing out the health hazards of these terrible scourges. Mental health is as important as physical health and clean and healthy living must be preached with the aim of securing for every man, woman and child perfect mental balance combined with a splendid physical frame and structure. It is necessary all the time to combat the morbid fascination which sickness, operations, hospital attendances, medicines to make people sleep, and other medicines to make the same people wake up and be stimulated, have to the minds of persons of all social classes. The answer to "How do you do?" these days is more likely to be a string of complaints of ill-health and visits to doctors or hospitals, than "Very well, thank you!" and ill-health gradually becomes as much of an English topic as the weather, at least amongst the over-thirty population. Positive Health is our essential slogan, and we need to teach people to be ashamed to speak about illness, and to take pride in their health and wellbeing, and to live clean, active and useful lives. At a Conference held by the Central Council for Health Education in January, various problems connected with the relationships between parents and their children were discussed, and the usefulness of parents clubs, and the teaching of Motherhood and Fatherhood. Early in the year a drive for increased care in the deposit of litter on the roads included the provision of more litter bins and the widespread display of a clever Lion poster with the slogan "Keep Britain Tidy"—this poster was copied for inclusion in the Southall Carnival brochure, the wording being changed to "Keep Southall Tidy." Use was made of the Carnival procession in August for propaganda against infectious disease. A large float was designed and entered in the Show by a famous baby food and drug firm; this displayed information about prevention by inoculation. The Mass X-ray Unit and the Gas Board also took part in the Display. A special issue of new posters warning against the dangers of Venereal Disease was obtained, and circulated to medical practitioners for use in their waiting rooms or other offices as well as to factories and other sites suitable for these notices. 30 HOME SAFETY The number who died as a result of accident other than motor vehicle accident was identical with that for the previous year—14 in 1962 and 14 in 1961. Eight of the accidental deaths were the result of accident in the home, four happened in hospital, and two on the railway. Six elderly persons died from the consequences of falls, two from accidents at home and four from accidents in hospital. Two persons died from swallowing poison, three from gas poisoning, one was drowned in the bath during an epileptic fit. There were seven suicides: two swallowed drugs, one was found hanged, and four died from gas poisoning; the ages of these varied from 42 to 64. Health Education on Home Safety in its various aspects continued through the year, new ideas being obtained at a Conference held by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in October. The need for dwelling-houses and homes for the elderly to be built or adapted for safety is continually being stressed by the staff of the Public Health Department, and there have been notable improvements in this respect locally. 31 ROAD SAFETY Three persons (2 adults, 1 child) were killed in street accidents in Southall during 1962. The figure was seven in 1961. Details are as follows:— Persons Killed Type of Road User Cause of Accident Age Sex Pedestrian Van travelling South hit child running across road from West to East 2yrs. 11 mths. M Pedal Cyclist Pedal Cyclist entering main road from side road collided with motor car on main road 75 M Pedestrian Pedestrian stepped from West kerb into path of oncoming private motor car travelling North 70 F Persons Injured Adult School Age Under 5 Serious Slight Serious Slight Serious Slight Pedestrians 15 40 8 21 - 5 Total 55 Total 29 Pedal Cyclists 10 60 4 17 - - Total 70 Total 21 Private Motor Car Drivers 5 46 — Total 51 Private Motor Car Passengers 6 37 - 3 - 3 Total 43 Motor Cyclists 14 42 — — - — Total 56 Scooter and Moped Riders 7 33 - - - - Total 40 Drivers of other vehicles 1 6 - - - - Total 7 Passengers in/on other vehicles 3 22 — 2 - — Total 25 Summary Persons killed 2 Adults 1 Child Persons injured: Serious 61 Adults 12 Children Slight 286 Adults 51 Children 347 Adults 63 Children The year showed an improvement in the motor vehicle accident figures for Southall. The total of persons killed or injured was lower by 73 than in 1961, but a 2-year-old boy was killed; and the number of children injured was down from 82 in 1961 to 63 in 1962. Of the three dying as a result of motor accidents in Southall, two were Southall residents and this included the 2-year-old boy; one other Southall resident died as a result of a road accident received when he was away from home. 32 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply and Water Services Water is supplied to nearly the whole of the district by the South-West Suburban Water Company. The Metropolitan Water Board supplies a small area in the southern part of the district, and the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company a small area in the northern part. The supply is satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. Reports on sampling carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. All inhabited houses are supplied from public water mains and there are no stand-pipes in use on mains. Under Section 35, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, provision is made for immediate action to be taken by the Local Authority to restore a water supply which has been cut off for some default. Sampling of artesian wells used in certain local industrial plants was carried out; thirteen samples were taken from six factories, two for chemical analysis, eleven for bacterial. In two instances doubtful bacteriological findings were followed by further sampling which proved satisfactory. Sewerage Middlesex County Council provides the facilities for purification of sewage from the Borough at the Mogden Sewage Works. The amount of congestion occurring in the drains and sewers of the Borough, partly as a result of increase in the number of houses and shops, partly due to the fact that improved knowledge of hygiene results in an increased use of water for cleanliness, meant that problems have arisen of overcharging of sewers, and of flooding during periods of heavy rain. Measures to relieve this have had to be taken, and the latest position with regard to these improvements is as follows:— Additional surface water sewers were installed in part of Dormers Wells Lane, reducing the risk of flooding in this road. The Southern Soil Relief Sewer was completed, and risk of overflow of sewage in the south of the Borough removed. The only pail closets emptied by the Council are two at "Springdale." There are two cesspools emptied by the Council's gully emptier—one at "Springdale" and one at Wyke Green. Refuse Collection and Disposal Southall Borough Council provides one dustbin free to every separately rated hereditament, the number of bins so supplied is approximately 17,000. The renewal period for these is when the dustbins have worn out, but not more frequently than once in ten years. Weekly collections are made from houses; three times a week from St. Bernard's Hospital; twiceweekly collections are made from other Hospitals and high flats. Weekly collections from shops and industrial premises are generally made, sometimes more frequently. Large amounts are charged for. Special collections from domestic and other premises are made by arrangement. The Council maintain a fleet of vehicles, including 9 freighters on refuse collection, one lorry for special collections. Refuse is picked over for salvage in the Council Depot; salvaged materials being sold and the residue is either incinerated at the Depot or carried to be tipped at an authorised site at West Drayton. Street Cleansing The main shopping streets are cleansed daily and other roads are cleansed once, twice or three times a week depending on various conditions. For this purpose, one lorry, one mechanical sweeper-collector and one suction footpath sweeper are used. There are 14 street orderlies with hand trucks. Sweepings are conveyed to the Depot and subsequently to the tip at West Drayton. 33 In addition, one gully-emptying machine is used to cleanse the street gullies, which number approximately 3,250 in the Borough; each gully being cleansed four times a year. The refuse is tipped at the Council Depot and then carted to West Drayton. Public Conveniences Five public conveniences are maintained by the Borough Council in the Borough in addition to those provided in the public parks. These are sited at the Town Hall, High Street; The Green (Manor House Grounds); Jubilee Gardens; King George's Field, Lady Margaret Road; and Norwood Green. Each convenience provides accommodation for both sexes. No charge is made for the use of the facilities, attendance is provided and free washing facilities are available, but a small charge is made for linen towels. For details of use of towels see page 39. In addition, the public conveniences in the public parks are as follows: Cranleigh Playpark; Municipal Sports Ground, in pavilion; Southall Park; Recreation Ground, in ground, pavilion and Swimming Bath; Wolf Fields, in pavilion. The old conveniences in Southall Park were renovated during the year. Sanitary Inspection of the District The total number of inspections of premises made during the year by the Public Health Inspectors was 8,777. Table XI gives an analysis of the number and nature of such inspections. One considerable figure is the amount of visits carried out under the Clean Air Act (Smoke Control Areas) requirements. The progress of this work is good, as the difficult early problems have gradually been overcome and a routine of survey, enquiry, report and assessment established. These visits serve multiple purposes, as any sanitary defects in the houses visited would be brought to the notice of a health inspector calling, even though the purpose of his call was specific. Another figure showing an increase is that for Infectious Disease visits, required by the need for firm control of any home conditions likely to permit the spread of infection— notification of any of the notifiable diseases other than measles and whooping cough is followed as a routine by a visit from the Public Health Inspector to ascertain the source of infection and advise on action to be taken, even when in notified dysentery or food poisoning the disease is only marked as "suspected." Market There is a market, part open, part covered, in the High Street where a weekly horse and cattle sale is held on Wednesdays and a general sale of market produce and goods is held on Saturdays. Special attention was paid regularly to the hygienic provisions and maintenance there. In addition, travelling fairs and circuses spend periods in the Borough, three to four times a year, and require supervision. School Sanitation, Ventilation and Lighting Schemes for the improvement of sanitary conditions in Southall schools made progress during the year as follows:— Featherstone Road Infants—Four new indoor water closets and four hand basins were provided. 34 Western Road Girls —Seven new indoor water closets and seven wash basins were provided. The Borough Council provides the number of dustbins required for the removal of school refuse. Eradication of Bed Bugs, Fleas and Lice Statistics for the year:— (a) Number of Council houses (1) found to be infested 4 (2) disinfested during the year 4 (b) Number of other houses (1) found to be infested 11 (2) disinfested during the year 11 Total 15 Canal Boats Southall is not a registration authority for Canal Boats. Inspections are carried out in the Boroughs having mooring depots for these boats as a routine procedure and only rarely is there need for interference by any officer of Southall. No report was necessary during 1962. Mortuary and Post-Mortem Room The mortuary, situated in Havelock Road, provides adequate accommodation for the Borough but is little used. No bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year. Twenty-five bodies were deposited in the mortuary at Acton and ninety-eight bodies in the mortuary at Uxbridge, for post-mortem purposes and coroner's inquest if necessary. Factories Act, 1937 The following tables give details of the work done in connection with the factories and outworkers in the Borough:— Inspections Factory Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 13 3 - - (ii) Factories not included in (i) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 168 208 - - (iii) Other Premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers' premises) - - - - Totals 181 211 - - 35 Defects Found Particulars Number of cases in which defects were found Found Remedied Referred Number of cases in which Prosecutions were instituted To H.M.

A further five years'programme of 72 houses was approved by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government on the 17th August, 1961. During 1962 an undertaking was given that Nos. 3 and 4 Park View Road, which were in the second list, would not be used for human habitation, and Nos. 1-14 Buckingham Terrace from the first list were represented as unfit; no order for demolition had, however, been made up to the end of the year. No slum properties were demolished during the year. Improvement Grants (Housing Act, 1949, as amended by the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958). Twenty-nine applications were approved for grant for property improvement. This figure was thirty-eight in 1961, and it is a great pity that grants for works of improvement which can be subsidised in part by the State are not applied for to a very much greater extent. As can be seen from the earlier part of the Report, the need for the provision of sanitary facilities, particularly baths, is quite considerable, enough to justify the provision of new slipper baths, and therefore certainly enough to warrant support and assistance for the improvement of houses which are still structurally sound, though lacking in modern facilities. In all, up to the end of 1962 only 146 of these Improvement Grants have been approved. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) During the year 8 applications were received, 8 proposals to issue certificates were approved. One certificate of revocation of the disrepair certificate was approved. Overcrowding More visits were required in 1962 to be paid for estimation of overcrowding and thirteen cases of new overcrowding were confirmed. Ten cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. The number remaining on the Department's register of overcrowding at the end of the year was 38 dwellings, which is an increase of three on last year's figure. For further details see Table XII, page 69. Rehousing of Applicants for Council Dwellings Council Housing within the Borough The number of families obtaining Council accommodation for the first time in 1962 was 36. Nine old persons were rehoused from the waiting list and six were transferred from larger Council properties. Two old age pensioners' bungalows in Telford Road and eight bedsitting room flats in Jersey Court were completed during the year. New Town Housing The total number of families removing to New or Expanded Towns: 25 families nominated under the Industrial Selection Scheme up to April, 1956 (since when the Council has had to pay subsidy for every family moving from this Borough to New or Expanded Towns); in addition, 50 families who had found their own accommodation in one of the New Towns were subsequently accepted as Council nominees; the total number of families who have moved to New or Expanded Towns since that date is a further 296, thirty-six families having been rehoused in this way during 1962. Modernisation of Council Houses There were 426 houses, built between 1930 and 1936, which still had old ranges with hot water supply, except where the tenants themselves installed modern fireplaces. Twentysix of these ranges were replaced by the Council during 1962, making a total of 305 modernised up to the 31st December, 1962. 37 Bathrooms were provided and new grates and electrical power points were installed in six old persons' bungalows in Saxon Gardens, and five old persons' bungalows in Allenby Road. New grates and electrical power points were installed in eight old persons' bungalows in Brunei Place and two old persons' bungalows in Brindley Way. Bathrooms, modern grates and electric power points were provided in three purchased houses, one in Allenby Road, one in Abbotts Road and one in Beaconsfield Road. Houses in Multiple Occupation At the end of the year, 475 houses had been ascertained to be let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The relevant sections of the Public Health Act, 1936, were applied as fully as possible to the conditions where deterioration of hygiene standards occurred. The Housing Act, 1961, came into force on the 24th November, 1961, affording a measure of new control. The Council in 1962 adopted a new standard of occupation, making this correspond with the standard which renders the owner or tenant of a dwellinghouse liable to Abatement Notice. Middlesex County Council Act, 1944— Section 345 The caravan site at the junction of Regina Road and Pluckington Place continued to be used as the winter quarters of a member of the Showmen's Guild. New Housing The following details have been supplied by the Borough Engineer, outlining the complete amount of house building for Southall since the end of the war. Built by Southall Borough Council During the Year 1962 Since the End of the War (including 1962) Within the Borough Outside the Borough Within the Borough Outside the Borough Old Peoples' Dwellings 8 - 125 12 Houses 2 - 332 136 Flats 9 - 399 144 Prefabricated Houses — — 299 — Twenty-one of the temporary prefabricated bungalows have now been demolished and the tenants transferred to permanent housing, leaving 278 still standing. Built by Private Enterprise During the Year 1962 Since the End of the War (including 1962) Old Peoples' Dwellings - 20 Houses 1 299 Flats - 106 Prefabricated Houses - - Almshouses (Association built) 4 4 38 HYGIENE OF FOOD Food Poisoning Three notifications of food poisoning were received during 1962. All of these were confirmed bacteriologically as being due to infection with the organism Salmonella Typhi Murium. One case notified as gastro-enteritis was subsequently found to be food poisoning caused by Salmonella Bredeney, and twenty cases notified as dysentery were subsequently confirmed as being due to Salmonellas, types Heidelberg and Bredeney, and one untyped. The Medical Research Council sent an observer to try to trace the origins of the type Heidelberg and Bredeney infections, but nothing conclusive was obtained from these researches, though it seemed likely that cooked meats were the source of infection in the first cases of both illnesses. Personal Hygiene The free washing facilities in the public conveniences, which were brought into operation in September, 1950, continued to be available throughout 1962. During that period 6,800 paper towels were issued free, and also 943 linen towels, which were provided at a cost of 2d. per person. Milk The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, transferred licensing to the food and drugs authority, which for this area is the Middlesex County Council (see report of Public Control Officer, pages 40,41, 42, and 43). Seven distributors of bottled milk registered under the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959, making a total of 39 on the register. Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947-1952. As there were no manufacturers in the Borough, temperature control observations, as laid down in these Regulations, were not required. Routine work was carried out under Article 4 of the 1947 Regulations to check the conservation of ice-cream in cinemas. Food Sampling The bacteriological analyses of 169 food samples, taken during the year, were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. One hundred and thirty-one of these specimens were ice-cream samples covering six makes of ice-cream, and following bacteriological analyses the ice-creams were graded as follows:— Excellent 95 Satisfactory 32 Doubtful 2 Unsatisfactory 2 These ice-cream figures were very much improved on those for 1961, and as our local control is much more strict than elsewhere, being based on a bacterial count rather than a rough chemical one, which is sufficient for statutory requirements, this is very satisfactory. Thirty-five samples were taken of imitation cream. Thirty-four of these were satisfactory and one was unsatisfactory. Other samples taken:— Steak Satisfactory Peas Satisfactory Potatoes Satisfactory 39 Satisfactory communication has been maintained during the year with the County Public Control Department, and the report on the work carried out in Southall by the staff of that Department is as follows:— Article Total Samples Taken Unsatisfactory Milk (new) 77 4 Milk (various) 5 — Butter 38 — Cakes, Cake Mixes 3 — Cream 17 1 Drugs 6 — Fish and Fish Products 15 — Fruit (fresh) 19 — Fruit (canned) 4 — Ice Cream 14 — Liver 13 — Margarine 4 — Meat and Meat Products 44 3 Preserves 6 — Sausages 9 1 Vinegar and Non-Brewed Condiment 14 — Miscellaneous 7 2 Total 295 11 Milk Four samples of new milk taken at a dairy in this area were found to be deficient in milk fat. The samples were procured from churns which were parts of larger consignments, the bulked quantity of which was satisfactory. Cream A resident complained of cream purchased from a self-service store that it had a bitter taste. This was confirmed by the Public Analyst who explained that nothing chemically was wrong with the sample and that bitterness could have arisen from bacterial contamination. It might also develop in cream not properly stirred and cooled and could also have arisen from the consumption of certain obnoxious weeds by cows whose milk was used in the preparation of the cream. In the circumstances a caution was sent to the sellers. Meat and Meal Products Three samples of minced beef which were procured from a butcher in Southall were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not permitted in minced beef. The butcher was prosecuted in respect of one sample which contained 422 parts per million of the preservative and he was fined £5 and ordered to pay eight guineas towards the costs. Sausages A sample of sausages was found to contain sulphur dioxide, which fact was not, as is required, declared by notice at the time of purchase. When on the following day an attempt was made to obtain a similar purchase the requisite notice was properly displayed. In these circumstances no punitive action was taken. Miscellaneous Two samples of fried chipped potatoes were procured from a fried fishmonger's shop and were found to contain a small quantity of sulphur dioxide which was not at that 40 time permitted. Regulations permitting the presence of sulphur dioxide in chipped potatoes were due to come into force within a few weeks and for this reason the seller was cautioned. Examination of Natural Foods In addition to samples of natural foods purchased in the Borough (54), labelled stacks and displays of fish (29), meat (51), apples (77), citrus fruit (20), offal (21), and potatoes (19) were examined in 120 shops. Formal samples are selectively procured based on these examinations and labelled displays of natural foods where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the label or where there is need for further more detailed examination. The inspectors of the Department have, over a number of years, acquired a considerable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and varieties of fish and fruit. No serious infringements were disclosed. New Legislation In 1962 regulations were introduced dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers in food, and with preservatives in food. In addition, there has been an amended food standard relating to table jellies. The effect of the regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers and with preservatives is to define and limit the additives, and (in the case of preservatives), to extend the range of foods in which preservatives are allowed, and the types of preservative which are permitted, but nevertheless closely limiting the quantities of such preservatives. No infringements arising from the new regulations have been reported during the year. The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indications of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 166 premises and 56 stacks and displays of meat, 109 of apples, 71 of tomatoes, 68 of butter, 7 of bacon and 50 of other miscellaneous foods were examined for compliance with the Orders. Minor infringements have been dealt with by verbal warnings. Safe Milk Fifty samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured from retailers in the district and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed. One failure has been reported. This was of a bottle of tuberculin tested pasteurised milk which failed the methylene blue test and in respect of which the notice of failure required by statute was sent to the licensee. Seventy-seven inspections of premises in which milk is pasteurised or at which it was sold were carried out during the year to ensure that the premises concerned conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. Sixteen samples of raw milk were procured and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of 103 premises have been visited in connection with the Order, and 536 articles of food have been examined. Arising from these inspections in the borough a firm was sent a letter of caution for failing to disclose the ingredients on packets of mixed vegetables. A letter of caution was sent to a manufacturer of sweets which were claimed to be "made with fresh dairy butter, glucose and treacle." Because only 6 % of the total 11 % of fat in the sweets was milk fat the manufacturers' advertising literature was altered so as to make clear that although butter fat was present it was not the only fat used. A retail shopkeeper 41 was cautioned because, in relation to sterilised cream, he used an advertisement offering "thick" cream. Thick cream must have a butter fat content of not less than 48 % whereas sterilised cream is required to have 23 % of butter fat. The misleading advertisement was displayed in ignorance of the specialised meaning of "thick" in this context. Labelling and Advertising of Foodstuffs A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, while it did not arise from samples and inspections in the Southall area, nevertheless has the effect of protecting the residents of the County District. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the county. Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the labels of food the name and address of the packer or labeller. Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not bear a statement of ingredients. One manufacturer of ice cream was found to be putting all the statutory declarations on the base of the carton. He was reminded that these declarations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent. Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin. The Merchandise Marks Act requires this, and letters Were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligations to declare the origin in advertisements. Some prepacked lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be in half-inch letters; the lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. Matters dealt with under the Food and Drugs Act by correspondence included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than was considered sufficient to justify the title. Five examples of cake-mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions, such as egg or milk, were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified, and he amended his labels to delete the claim. A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was "full of lean red meat." In fact, the meat content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained "more meat." In fact the percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products, and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim. The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be "vitamin enriched." The vitamins present did not provide onehalf of the daily requirement which, it is considered, is the minimum to support claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to "vitamin fortified" which, because vitamins were added, was true. A sample of ice lollies, for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not to be correct. The lollies originally, it was found, had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe. The label was not amended to conform to the new recipe and was therefore incorrect. Reference to glucose was deleted from the new labels. A sample of sodium fluoride tablets was found on analysis to be deficient of the stated amount of the chemical. Because, in spite of the deficiency in the chemical, it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired, the manufacturer was not prosecuted but was sent a letter of caution. Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee. The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution. Similar action was taken in respect of a sample of dried apricots which were found to contain sulphur dioxide. The quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared, and the manufacturers were required to amend the label. 42 A firm of confectionery importers was cautioned for selling sweets containing colouring matter not permitted. The firm had withdrawn from retailers sweets imported earlier, and had thought the stock from which the samples were procured were satisfactory. Only permitted colours are now used. During the year a manufacturer put on to the market with a large scale newspaper advertising campaign a new product which consisted of 99 % pure sugar with 1 % of saccharin. It was claimed for this product that it was "Slimmers Sugar." The manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the product (because it contained saccharin) was not sugar. Exception was taken to advertising matter for the same reasons. Correction of advertising matter and the labels was secured, the manufacturer devising a new description for his product. An advertisement for vitamin capsules made extravagant claims. On being challenged, the advertiser modified his literature so as to delete the objectionable wording used. Meat Inspections No slaughtering of meat is carried on in Southall.

In addition, the station which was established in 1959 at the Manor House, for the estimation of smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution by the volumetric method, whereby air is drawn through two filters, one dry and one liquid, continuously and the amount of atmospheric pollution calculated every 24 hours from the matter deposited on the filter, and from the amount of sulphur taken up by the liquid, continued to operate during 1962. For 1962 results see page 47. The results obtained from the five sites (i.e. Recreation Ground and Railway Allotments— lead peroxide method; Hortus Cemetery, New Primary School, Railway Allotments —deposit gauges) are tabulated on page 54 and graphs prepared from the figures on the table are to be found on pages 48, 49, 50, 51 and 52. Comparison of ten years' averages at Hortus Cemetery. Total solids deposited:— 1953 10.67 1958 13.83 1954 14.30 1959 13.04 1955 16.94 1960 10.30 1956 12.93 1961 10.86 1957 10.66 1962 11.32 Comparisons with three other places, i.e. Westminster, Cambridge and Sheffield, still show that Southall is atmospherically much less impure all the year round than a highly industrial area, but the Borough is included in a large ring round and including London itself designated as a black area for atmospheric pollution under the Clean Air Act, 1956. The position regarding industrial smoke emissions remains reasonably satisfactory. Unsatisfactory conditions are now mainly due to carelessness in operation or mechanical defects and present no special technical problem. As a result of discussions during the year a large timber yard, which has been a persistent source of smoke and grit from the burning of wood waste, is to arrange disposal of this waste away from the premises. One laundry firm, following warnings, was prosecuted and fined £3 under the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958, for the emission of five minutes' continuous black smoke from an oil.fired boiler. Fourteen complaints of smoke and ash, mainly covering the burning of garden and trade refuse, were received. In twelve cases the nuisances were remedied following informal action. In two cases the alleged nuisances were not confirmed. Smoke Control Areas Smoke Control Order No. 3 came into operation on the 1st July, 1962. The premises now covered by operative Orders are 2,286 houses, 27 industrial premises, 158 commercial premises and 27 other buildings. Smoke Control Order No. 4 was submitted and confirmed during the year. This becomes operative on the 1st July, 1963, and covers 908 houses, 14 industrial premises, 87 commercial premises and 11 other buildings in an area of 63 acres. Smoke Control Order No. 5 was submitted but confirmation had not been received by the end of the year. This area of 205 acres includes 1,428 houses, 16 industrial premises, 50 commercial premises and 4 other buildings. In response to Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular No. 4/62, the Council revised their smoke control programme and brought forward the estimated date of completion from 1973 to 1969. 46 Infringements of Smoke Control Orders Warning Letters were sent in three cases where smoke was emitted in a Smoke Control Area. The emissions were due in two cases to the burning of bituminous coal and in one case the burning of cardboard cartons. Acid Smuts from oil-burning chimneys Towards the end of the year replacement of two metal stacks serving four large oilfired central heating boilers was commenced. The new stacks are insulated to prevent the formation of acid smuts, and are at the factory referred to in the last Annual Report. This type of construction is now required for all new metal stacks serving oil fired boilers. Volumetric Method The daily mean concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide is measured by volumetric apparatus in the Manor House. The gauge faces west and a main road in a built up area of residential and commercial premises. The term "smoke" is used to denote all fine suspended impurity collected by the test filter and expressed as milligrams per 100 cubic metres. The term "sulphur dioxide" includes all acid producing gases in the air with the exception of carbon dioxide and is the net acidity of the air calculated until March, 1961, as sulphur dioxide and expressed as parts per 100 million parts of air, but from April, 1961, the method of calculation was altered by the officers of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and from that time the calculation was in microgrammes per cubic metre of air, so comparison with previous years was not possible. only the figures for th final nine months could be used, but comparisons can now be made between the final thre quarters of 1961 and 1962. The 1962 results are set out as a full year's table.

This occurred in the first week in December and, although severe, was of shorter duration than in the great "smog" of 1952, which was fortunate, as the amount of sulphur dioxide emitted and presumably held in the fog over a period of days was, as can be seen, more than three times as high as on the worst day of the previous year. 47 48 Graph D Atmospheric Pollution Estimation— Deposit Gauges at Hortus Cemetery, Railway Allotments and New Primary School Total Solids, Soluble or Insoluble (Tons per square mile per month). 49 Graph E Atmospheric Pollution by Sulphur Oxides Determined by the Lead Peroxide Method Comparison with Other Districts These figures are printed with the permission of the Authorities concerned. 50 Graph F Atmospheric Pollution by Sulphur Oxides (Lead Peroxide Method) Daily Average (Milligrams Per 100 Sq.

Pet Animals Act, 1951 Six establishments were licensed during the year. The number of animals kept in each case was small and conditions have remained satisfactory. Administration of the Shops Acts Routine visiting of shops in connection with the Shops Acts Regulations continued. 55 River Pollution Inspection of the rivers and canal of Southall during the year did not give evidence of any individual site of pollution in Southall on which action could be taken, but the general condition of the water continued to deteriorate. Sampling of river water from the Brent at various stations in the County is carried out several times a year by officers of the Middlesex County Council. No premises were found during 1962 to be discharging polluting effluent into the river or canal. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment Seven establishments were inspected for licence under this heading and all were found satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Details are as follows:— Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 2 Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 5 Medical Examination of Borough Council Employees During 1962, a total of 75 medical examinations were carried out on applicants for Borough Council employment or members of the Borough Council staff. These examinations were carried out with regard to suitability for employment on the Council's permanent staff, for entry into the Sickness Pay Scheme, or for review after prolonged periods of sick leave. A survey of sickness absence amongst Borough Council staff during the year is shown in the table below, and the comparable statistics for the three previous years. Members of Indoor Establishment Year Staff Total Requiring Sick Leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1962 168 94 1,154 56 1961 165 89 1,187 54 1960 154 74 888 48 1959 157 93 1,295 59 Members of Outdoor Establishment Year Staff Total (Part-time and Full-time) Requiring Sick Leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1962 256 149 3,779½ 58 1961 281 127 4,561 45 1960 278 153 4,077½ 55 1959 282 206 5,509½ 73 Nuclear Radiation The increased production, transport, and use of radioactive material means that a new public health problem can arise. It has become apparent that some method of control is necessary and that a local authority requires to be informed of all possible sources of radiation within its district. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry, in hospitals and in technical schools and colleges, and it is important that as much information as possible should be 56 available as to the precautions taken in the use of the substances, and what, if anything, has to be done about waste products. The total use in Southall is said to be still extremely minute. The Metropolitan Water Board now gives, with its monthly report on the state of the water coming into public supply, a short notice of the radioactivity as estimated by the Board's Laboratory Staff, and also records the reports of the Atomic Energy Authority on the radioactive content of outfalls into the Thames from the nuclear reactors. The Radio Active Substances Act (1960) provided for the central registration and control of the keeping and use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive waste, and enabled the central authority to notify local authorities of the existence of registered premises within their boundaries. No notifications of this nature have yet been received in the Public Health Department. 57 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Through the Uxbridge Group Management Committee this authority maintains two hospitals in Southall, the Southall-Norwood Hospital (28 beds) for treatment of general medical and surgical cases and casualties, and Mount Pleasant Hospital (59 beds) for the treatment of geriatric cases. St. Bernard's Hospital is managed by its own Committee and is for the reception of cases of mental and nervous disorders; it has over 2,500 beds and takes patients from an extensive area comprising parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, including the Borough of Southall. Informal, temporary and compulsorily certified patients of all types are admitted, and all modern forms of treatment are carried out. Patients are now admitted informally (under the Mental Health Act, 1959) and Informal and Compulsory became the sole categories of admissions after 1st November, 1960. Other hospitals outside the Borough which are used to a considerable extent by patients from Southall are Hillingdon Hospital, West Middlesex Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Ealing. Southall cases of infectious disease mainly enter St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, which also has facilities for the treatment of geriatric cases. The greatest number attend Hillingdon, which has all the facilities of an acute general hospital, a geriatric section and a maternity wing, either as outpatients, or as inpatients; in 1962, 2,998 Southall residents had inpatient treatment in Hillingdon compared with 1,562 in 1961. This figure includes 1,362 maternity mothers and babies discharged, compared with 1,170 in 1961 and 807 in 1960. So the figure for maternity cases has grown over 50% in the last two years. In 1962, 17.73 % of all the patients treated to a conclusion in Hillingdon Hospital came from Southall. Mount Pleasant Hospital provides accommodation for 39 female and 20 male elderly patients who are in need of medical and nursing care. Facilities are provided for occupational therapy and physiotherapy treatment. Patients who are normally looked after at home, are admitted for short periods to enable their relatives to have a holiday, etc. The Hospital has a very active Comforts Committee who raise funds to provide additional amenities to the patients. In addition, a trolley shop organised by the local W.V.S. caters for their daily needs. A weekly library service is provided by the Red Cross Society. Of the total number of discharges and deaths of 134 at this hospital for the year, 73 had been admitted from residences within the Borough. The Uxbridge Chest Clinic is the regional centre to which residents of the Borough of Southall may be referred regarding chest disorders. It is also the regional centre for the diagnosis, treatment, aftercare and prevention of tuberculosis (both pulmonary and nonpulmonary). Persons may be referred there by their own doctors, from Clinics, etc. Special "X-ray only" Clinics are available without appointment, otherwise persons are seen by appointment. There are male and female beds under the surveillance of clinic physicians at:— (1) Harefield Hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; and at (2) Hillingdon Hospital for the treatment of other chest disorders, and (3) Adelaide Ward of St. Bernard's Hospital—24 male and 24 female beds— for tuberculous patients—pulmonary and non-pulmonary.
