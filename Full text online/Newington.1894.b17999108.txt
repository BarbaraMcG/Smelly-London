COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. Six Cow and ten Slaughter houses were inspected, and all found in a clean and good condition. ST. PETER'S SCHOOLS. In May the Education Department called upon the authorities of St. Peter's Schools, Walworth, to reconstruct the drainage, and to provide additional sanitary appliances for those schools. Some little difficulty arose owing to the shallowness of the Vestry's brick sewer at the back, which would have made good drainage almost impossible. The authorities, therefore, decided to drain directly into the sewer in Shaftesbury Street, although at some additional cost; the work was carried out in a satisfactory manner. The expense of the drain connection from the forecourt to the sewer, together with that of covering the old sewer at the back with 12 inches of concrete, was borne by the Vestry. 153 The Vestry decided to close the schools, which in about a month wore again opened. ST. PETER'S CHURCH CRYPT. The coffins from the vault of this Church wore removed under an Order in Council, and under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, to the cemetery at Woking. The removal was conducted by the Necropolis Company, of Westminster Bridge Road, and occupied ten days, commencing from the 4th June. The coffins as a whole were in an excellent state of preservation, and were conveyed in railway vans to the Depot of tho Necropolis Company and thence by rail to Woking. Two hundred and forty-seven coffins were dispatched as they were found in the vault, without any cases. Forty-three coffins had to be placed in cases. Seven cases were filled with parts of coffins and other matters. No complaint was made by any of tho inhabitants, and tho whole of the removals took place without any difficulty arising. The necessary disinfectants were used. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. Milk.—One hundred and eighteen samples were taken; 70 were genuine, and five had been deprived of the natural cream to tho following extent: two 50, two 40, and one 34 per cent. In one instance a fine of 40/- and 12/6 costs was inflicted; in another instance the penalty was 30/- and 12/6 costs; and in a third case 20/- and 12/6 costs.

In six cases tho milk was said to havo boon slightly watered, and the vendors wero cautioned. In one case the summons was dismissed, as the analyst admitted the milk had been frozen, and this might havo interfered with tho analysis.

It is thus evident that the comparatively large amount of organic contamination in the Thames derived-water noted in 1891 has been very nearly equalled during the flood of November last, whilst the maximum impurity in the Lea was much smaller than that noted in 1891, and was oven slightly less than in 1893. 170 TABLE 11.
