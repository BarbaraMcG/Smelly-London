This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1893, to the 25th day of March, 1894, a year of considerable importance to Local Authorities in the Metropolis, owing to the impending changes in Local Government. The question of the " Unification of London," which is at the present time under the consideration of a Royal Commission, is one of great importance to the Ratepayers, and also affects the present Local Authorities ; it is difficult to tell what shape the recommendations of the Commission are likely to assume and it is not necessary to here discuss the various suggestions which have been put forward for consideration, but it will be sufficient to confine this Report to a summary of the work which has been done in the District during the past year. 9 One hundred and two Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are the particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 27 Special 5 Total — 32 Committee Meetings— Finance 23 Law and Parliamentary 7 Sanitary 13 Works 21 Special 6 Total — 70 Making in all a Total of 102 Changes in the Personnel of the Board. During the past year ten gentlemen who had been Members of the Board ceased to be connected with it, of these, three viz :—Messrs. Charles Baker, John Johnson, and John Harmston Coulson died; Mr. Francis Smith, and Drs. E. T. Watkins and John Watson left the District; Mr. James Neale became disqualified, and Messrs. William Henry Hewitt, Charles Fitz-Roy Doll and Reuben R. Pattison were not re-elected on the expiration of their term of office. Of the deceased Members, special reference must be made to Mr. Charles Baker who had been for 22 years a Member of the Board; during the past few years of his life failing health had prevented his taking so active a part in the discharge of his duties as was his previous custom, the services rendered by Mr. Baker in connection with parochial matters were, however, of such a character that it would be impossible to pass them over. 10 Of the Members who ceased to be qualified in consequence of having left the District, the name of Mr. Francis Smith as an old Member of the Board deserves special mention. Mr. Francis Smith had been for many years a Member of the Board. At the last meeting which he attended and took leave of his colleagues, the following resolution was passed:— "Resolved unanimously that the Board have received with sincere regret, the intelligence that they are about to lose the services of their colleague Mr. Francis Smith who has been for over 20 years a Member of the Board, and they desire to tender to him and to place upon record their high appreciation of the manner in which he has discharged his duties." Of the Members who were not re-elected the name of Mr. Charles Fitz-Roy Doll must be mentioned, he having been an active Member, and for two years filled the Chair of the Works Committee. This report would, however, be incomplete if it did not specially refer to the case of Mr. William Henry Hewitt, who at the time of his ceasing to be a Member was the "father of the Board," he having been a Member ever since its constitution in the year 1856, and being at the date of his retirement the only Member who had sat continuously on the Board. Mr. Hewitt has rendered valuable services to the District, and for 3 years represented it at the Metropolitan Board of Works. At a meeting of the Board held on the 9th January, 1894, intelligence was received of the death of Mr. Henry Gaisford Gotto, who had been for many years a Member, when the following resolution was passed:— 11 It was moved by Lieut.-Col. Gardiner, seconded by Mr Davison, and resolved that the Board have received with great regret the intelligence of the sudden death of their former colleague Henry Gaisf'ord Gotto, Esq., and desire to express to his widow and family their sincere sympathy in their heavy bereavement. The Local Government Act, 1894. This Act will have an important and far reaching influence on Local Authorities throughout England and Wales, and will also affect considerably the District Boards in the County of London. The qualification for membership which the Metropolis Management Acts required is abolished, and it will only now be necessary in order to be a Member that the person's name should appear on the Register of Parochial Electors. The Act also requires every District Board at the first meeting after the annual election of Members to elect a Chairman for the year, and the provisions of Section 41 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, as to the election of a Chairman at each meeting will only apply in case of the absence of the Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board will by virtue of his office be a Justice of the Peace, provided he is not disqualified by law from holding that office. At the time of writing this Report the first meeting after the election of Members has not taken place, but the name of the Chairman will be found printed at the head of the list of Members. The Act also contains provisions enabling powers to be transferred to District Board from other authorities. 12 Accounts. The accounts of the Board for the year are appended hereto, they have been prepared in the same form as has been adopted for many years, and having been checked by Mr. T. P. Scrivener, the chartered accountant engaged by the Board, they have been submitted to and passed by the auditors, whose certificate will be found on page 44. The comparative statement of income and expenditure which was appended to the Annual Report for the year 1893 for the first time, was found of considerable use, and the following statement of the expenditure of the two past years has therefore been prepared. Particular attention is directed to the items of expenditure over which the Board has no control, which, it will be observed, form a very considerable portion of the total amount which passed through the Boards hands.

The most important were the London (Equalization of Rates) Bill and the Local Government (England and Wales) Bill, both of which were Public Bills, and the following private Measures:—London County Council (General Powers) Bill; London County Council (Subways) Bill; London County Council (Open 14 Spaces) Bill; London County Council (Improvement Rate or Charge) Bill; London County Council (Improvements) Bill; Hampstead, St. Pancras, and Charing Cross Railway Bill; The National Telephone Bill; Metropolitan Police Provisional Order Bill; and in the Session of 1894, London County Council (Improvements) Bill; and the London Streets and Buildings Bill. A brief statement of the effect of these Bills must suffice. LONDON (EQUALIZATION OF RATES) BILL. This Bill was introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Fowler, the President of the Local Government Board, on the 1st of May, 1893, and proposed to make better provision for the equalization of rates as between the different parts of London ; as the Bill was not proceeded with no advantage can be gained by discussing its provisions. Another Bill bearing the title Equalization of Rates (London) Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 29th March, 1894 ; this Bill, which at the time of writing this Report is awaiting second reading, proposes to form an equalization fund equal to a rate of 6d. in the pound on the rateable value of the County of London, and to empower the London County Council to apportion this fund among the sanitary districts in London in proportion to their population. The following extracts from the return prepared by the Clerk to the Board show the effect of the Bill on the St. Giles District:— Rateable Value 6th April, 1894, £420,890. Population (Census 1891), 39,782. Equalization Fund of 6d. in the pound on the rateable value, £10,522. 15 Amount of Equalization Fund distributable to the St. Giles District according to population, £7,970, equal to a rate of 4.54d. Amount to be paid by the District to Equalization Fund, £2,552, or a sum equal to a fund of l'46d. in the pound. The Bill was considered by the Law and Parliamentary Committee, who recommended the Board that it should be opposed, and a petition was presented to the House of Commons against the Bill. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (ENGLAND AND WALES) BILL. This Bill, as originally introduced into the House of Commons on the 21st May, 1893, did not apply to London, except so far as the provisions relating to the qualification and election of Boards of Guardians; but while the Bill was passing through Committee in the House of Commons, amendments were inserted by which the provisions of Part II. of the Bill were applied to the County of London, and the qualification of Members of District Boards of Works was assimilated with the qualification of Members of Urban Authorities, and under the Bill District Boards required, for the first time in their history, to annually appoint a Chairman. Considerable discussion ensued on the Committee stage, in both Houses, as to these provisions in the Bill, but they were ultimately inserted in an amended form, and the Act received the Royal Assent on the 5th March, 1894. Its provisions, so far as they affect the District Boards of Works, were explained by the Local Government Board in a circular letter of the 19th March, 1894, in which the Board pointed out that, with the exception of the alterations as to the qualification of Members, the election of Members of District 16 Boards would be conducted as heretofore, and the annual election of Members will therefore take place as provided by the Metropolis Management Acts, on the first Wednesday in June, and it will be necessary for the Board, at the first meeting after the annual election of Members, to appoint a Chairman for the ensuing year of office. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) BILL. This Bill proposes to confer further powers on the London County Council, considerable opposition was offered to the measure and ultimately it passed in an amended form. No provision specially affecting the St. Giles District was inserted. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (SUBWAYS) BILL. This Bill proposed to confer much greater powers on the London County Council with regard to the Subways beneath Public Streets than they had hitherto possessed. The Board determined to oppose it, but the locus standi of the Board was objected to by the London County Council, and disallowed, and it was therefore impossible for the Board to take any further part in the measure and in an amended form it subsequently became law. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (OPEN SPACES) BILL. This Bill proposed, so far as the St. Giles District was concerned, to enable the London County Council to compulsorily acquire the gardens of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and to transfer the powers vested in the Trustees by the Act 8 George II, cap. 26, to the Council. This part of the Bill was ultimately rejected by the House of Lords. Another Bill on the same subject has been since introduced and has passed into law. 17 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (IMPROVEMENT RATE OR CHARGE) BILL. This Bill proposed to empower the London County Council to levy an improvement rate or charge in the Administrative County of London, on the ground that the burden of the cost of permanent improvements and works effected by the Council unduly pressed on occupiers of houses and tenements. The Bill passed through the House of Commons, but in consequence of amendments introduced by the House of Lords was not further proceeded with. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (IMPROVEMENTS) BILL. This Bill affected the St. Giles District so far as it proposed to construct a new central street from High Holborn to the Strand. After it was introduced into the House of Commons the Council determined to strike out of the Bill all the provisions relating to the street in question, and it is therefore unnecessary to explain its provisions: HAMPSTEAD, ST. PANCRAS AND CHARING CROSS RAILWAY BILL. This Bill proposed to confer further powers upon the promoters of the Bill which received the Royal assent in the year 1893 ; but the Board being of opinion that such were unnecessary and would prove prejudicial to the interests of the District, determined to oppose the Bill. As soon as a petition against the measure was presented, the promoters agreed to strike out all portions of the Bill referring to the St. Giles' District, and in this amended form the measure passed. 18 NATIONAL TELEPHONE BILL. This Bill was promoted by the National Telephone Company, but was not proceeded with beyond the initial stages. LONDON STREETS AND BUILDINGS BILL. This was a most important Bill, the object of which was declared by the preamble to be, to amend the existing provisions of the Building Acts which were complicated and in some respects doubtful and insufficient, to secure the construction and improvement of streets and buildings in a satisfactory manner, and to conduce to public convenience by consolidating and amending the existing law. The Bill consisted of a Preamble, 15 Parts (containing in all 192 Sections), and 4 Schedules. The Acts proposed to be consolidated extended from the year 1844 to the year 1893. The Bill proposed to repeal the whole of the existing legislation, and to provide one Act for dealing with the subject. It was referred by the Board to a Special Committee, consisting of the Members of the Law and Parliamentary and Works Committees, for consideration and report, and the Committee, after an elaborate examination of the measure, presented a Report, in which they drew attention to certain provisions which were in their opinion not suited to the central areas of the Metropolis, and a communication embodying the views of the Board upon the subject was ultimately forwarded to the London County Council. At the time of writing this Report the Bill stands referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, and the London County Council have already intimated their intention of making considerable amendments in, and modifications of, the same. 19 METROPOLITAN POLICE (PROVISIONAL ORDER) BILL. This Bill was referred to in the last Report. The object which the Board had in view having been sufficiently emphasised, the petition against the Bill was withdrawn, and in due course it passed into law. Some proceedings have since taken place between the Receiver of Police and the owner of the property, but no works have yet been executed. Sanitary Work, This subject may for convenience be divided into five headings:—Hie Public Health (London) Act, 1891; Tenement Lodging Houses; Housing of the Working Classes Act; General Sanitary Work ; and The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. During the year a very Jaige amount of work has been done under this Act. The Medical Officer's Report contains full information upon the subject, but the following statistics show the activity which has existed:— 10,821 visits and inspections were made; 769 notices for the abatement of nuisances served; 38 cases occurred where proceedings were necessary; in every instance orders were made by the Magistrates for the execution of the necessary works, and in some instances fines were imposed. The total amount of fines and costs recovered amounted to the sum of £20 4s. An agreement with the Honourable Society of Lincoln's c 2 20 Inn as to the execution of the above Act within their District, so far as Disinfections and Mortuary accommodation is concerned, has been entered into with the approval of the London County Council, The Medical Officer of Health was appointed a Delegate on behalf of the Board to attend the Third Annual Congress of the British Institute of Public Health, which was held in Edinburgh in July, 1893. TENEMENT LODGING HOUSES. There are at the present time 451 houses in the District subject to the regulations made by the Board under the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874, with regard to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The advantage of these regulations has been very great, as the following figures will show:—Total number of notices served, 339. Number of cases in which proceedings were taken, 12 ; fines and costs recovered, £8 17s. Od. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT. During the year 14 representations under Section 32 of the Act of 1890 were made by the Medical Officer ot Health. In every instance steps were forthwith taken with a view to the enforcement of the Act, and the following proceedings resulted:— Summonses issued - - - 12 Closing orders obtained - - 10 Fines and costs recovered - £4 13s. Closing orders determined - - 5 Demolition order served - - 1 21 GENERAL SANITARY WORK. A large number of notices and proceedings were taken with respect to underground rooms, overcrowding, unwholesome food, disposal and removal of offensive refuse, and breaches of the Bye-Laws, etc., the details of which will be found in the Medical Officer's Report. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. On the 9th May, 1893, Mr. James Kear Colwell was reappointed Analyst. During the year 266 samples were purchased and analysed. In 52 cases the samples were adulterated, but in 16 instances the adulteration was not of such a serious character to justify any proceedings being taken; in all other cases proceedings were taken, and the fines and costs I'ecovered amounted to the sum of £25 16s. Od. In 3 cases proceedings were taken for refusing to sell samples, and for giving false warranties. The Analyst's report will be found on page 58. Flushing of Water Closets. In the year 1892 the attention of the Local Government Board was directed to the necessity for an alteration of the regulations made under the Metropolis "Water Act, 1871, with regard to the capacity of water waste-preventing cisterns; communications were addressed to every Sanitary Authority in the County of London, but only in two or three instances were they of the opinion of the Board—viz., that the present size of water waste-preventing cisterns is insufficient, and that cisterns which are capable of discharging at least three gallons of water at each flush should be substituted. 22 The question was also brought before the notice of the London County Council, who were in favour of the proposals, and it is hoped that steps will shortly be taken for giving effect to the Board's views. Bye-Laws. Legislation by Bye-laws is continually increasing, and during the past year the Board have made Bye-laws under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the prevention of nuisances, the cleansing of cisterns, and the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action. The London County Council have also made Bye-laws under the same Act dealing with the removal of offensive or noxious matters, the cleansing and filling up of cesspools, and the removal and disposal of refuse, also with respect to water-closets and the accessories thereof in connection with buildings. These Bye-laws received very careful consideration at the hands of the Board, who made representations to the Local Government Board upon the subject, and after considerable amendment the Bye-laws were approved by the Local Government Board in the month of June, 1893. The duty of enforcing these Bye-laws is cast by the Act upon the Local Sanitary Authorities. The necessity for alterations in the Bye-laws for regulating the proceedings of the Board and its Committees has been plainly demonstrated within the last few years, and the question has been referred by the Board to a special Committee for consideration and report. 23 Common Lodging-houses. Under the powers conferred upon him by the Local Government Act, 1888, the Secretary of State for the Home Department has made a Provisional Order transferring the cont rol of Common Lodging-houses in the County of London, which has hitherto under the Common Lodging-house Acts been vested in the Commissioner of Police, to the London County Council When the matter was under consideration the desirability of Local Authorities being entrusted with the supervision of Common Lodging-houses was suggested, and a communication to that effect was addressed to the Secretary of State, he, however, declined to give effect to the same. Free Library. During the year an arrangement has been completed between the Board and the Commissioners of Public Libraries and Museums for the District of St. Giles, whereby certain surplus land belonging to the Board in High Holborn has been sold to the Commissioners for the purpose of their erecting thereon a Public Library. The Board have also consented to the Commissioners borrowing the necessary sums, not exceeding in the whole £10,000, for the purchase of the land and the erection of the buildings thereon. On the 3rd May, 1893, a requisition was received from a number of county electors requiring the Board to take the necessary steps for ascertaining the opinion of the voters as 24 to whether or not the limitation which restricted the rate to one halfpenny in the £ should be removed. The Clerk to the Board was appointed Presiding Officer for the purpose of taking the poll, and the result was as follows:— The number of voting papers issued, corresponding with the number of voters on the register, was 6,723 The number of persons voting “Yes” in favour of the existing limitation of the rate under the Public Libraries Act, 1892, being removed was 1,130 The number of persons voting “No ”against the removal of the existing limitation was 1,100 The number of invalid voting papers was as follows:— Marked “Yes” in favour of the removal of the limitation 100 Marked “No” gainst the removal of the limitation 108 Papers irregularly filled up 37 Number of papers not filled up 2,054 Number of papers not returned 2,194 Total 6,723 It will thus be seen that out of an electorate of 6,723, only 2,475 persons took the trouble to fill up and return their voting papers, and of these no less than 245 were irregularly marked. The result was that the limitation was removed, and the Commissioners are now entitled to levy a rate of not exceeding 1d. in the £. 25 In the month of June, 1893, the Board decided that the number of Commissioners should be increased to nine, the limit allowed by the Public Libraries Act, 1892, and the following gentlemen were elected additional Comm'ssioners:—E. Maunde Thompson, C.B., D.C.L., Principal Librarian of the British Museum; Dr. Richard Garnett, Keeper of the Printed Books Department of the British Museum; and Mr. Thomas H. D. Berridge. The following Commissioners, who retired by effluxion of time, were re-elected;—Messrs. Charles Bussell and Charles Fitz-Roy Doll. Mr. James Neale, a Commissioner, during the year resigned his office, and the vacancy thus created was filled by the appointment of Mr. George Philip Willoughby. London Streets (Removal of Gates) Act, 1890. Under this Act the gate which formerly existed across Torrington Place has been removed, the carriage-way of that thoroughfare and of Byng Place having been previously paved with wood. In order to secure uniformity of treatment the Board have entered into an agreement with the Vestry of St. Pancras, whereby the Vestry, in consideration of an annual payment, have undertaken the maintenance, cleansing, and repair of those portions of Torrington Place and Byng Place which are within the St. Giles District Unemployed. The question of finding work for the unemployed was brought prominently under the notice of the Board by a communication from the Local Government Board upon the 26 subject. The register of persons seeking employment, which had been kept in the Board's Offices for several years, was again brought into requisition, and the names of a considerable number of persons seeking employment registered, a number of whom were employed temporarily for the purposes of the Board; but the register did not serve the purpose which was anticipated—viz., that of informing employers where they could obtain workmen. The question is a very difficult one. Transfer of Jurisdiction, In the year 1892 the Vestry of St. Pancras applied to the London County Council to make an Order under the Local Government Act, 1888, transferring Prospect Terrace, Gray's Inn Road, and the disused Burial Grounds of St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. George the Martyr, Holborn, from the Parishes in which they were by law situated to the Parish of St. Pancras, in which they were geographically placed. The question as to the power of the London County Council to make an Order, on the ground that it was in effect directly overruling the express provisions of the Acts under which the Burial Grounds were purchased, was raised ; but the decision of the Court of Appeal was to the effect that the London County Council had power to entertain the application, and after a lengthened enquiry, the Council came to the conclusion that it was desirable that the transfer should be made, and an Order was accordingly issued. No further opposition was offered to this Order, and it has since been confirmed by the Local Government Board, and the transfer of jurisdiction took effect on the 25th March, 1894. 27 The Wedding of the Duke of York, On the occasion of the marriage of His Royal Highness the Duke of York with Princess May of Teck, a Committee, consisting: of the Members of the Board and the Joint Vestry, was organized to consider the best means of celebrating the Royal Wedding in the District. The Special Committee, at a meeting held on the 27th June, 1893, resolved that an entertainment should be provided for the whole of the children attending the Elementary Schools in the District between the ages of 7 and 13 years. Arrangements were made for taking the children to the Crystal Palace, and on the 12th July the excursion took place, when 1,426 children attended, accompanied by 61 teachers. The cost, £165 5s. 1d., was defrayed by voluntary contributions to the extent of £160 2s. 6d. At a meeting of the Board, held on the 26th September, 1893, the following resolution was passed:—It was moved by Mr. Mayo, seconded by Mr. Berridge, and resolved unanimously, “That the Board desire to express their thanks to Mr. Henry C. Jones for the manner in which he carried out the arrangements for celebrating the Royal Wedding in the district.” HENRY C. JONES, Cleric to the Board.

Lloyds Court. Feathers Court. Nottingham Court. Lascelles Court. Princes Court. Lascelles Place. Shelton Street. Little Turnstile. Twyford Buildings. 49 Street Cleansing, The scavenging of the District was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, numbering 38 men (consisting of 1 foreman, 5 gangers, and 32 sweepers) and 28 boys, the total scavenging staff amounting to 66 men and boys. In addition to the manual labour, two sweeping machines, drawn by horses,were also used in sweeping the carriageways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 5,575 van loads, equal to over 16,000 cubic yards. There were also removed, 1,547 van loads of refuse matter from the gully pits, &c amounting to over 4,500 yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares were washed frequently during the year by means of water distributed by watering-carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The question of the expediency of cleansing the carriageways of those streets paved with wood and asphalte by means of water taken from the Water Company's mains through hose and jet, was referred to me by your Works Committee to report upon, which I accordingly did at great length on the 5th January.—The Committee ordered the Eeport to be printed, and it was carefully considered by the Committee, but no recommendation to your Board with reference to the same was made. The question of extending the cleansing of the streets on Sundays was also before your Board last year, when you E 50 requested me to report to you on the subject. This I did in the early part of the present year, and your Board subsequently resolved to employ the -whole of the Board's staff of men and certain of the boys, with such extra vans as might be needed in the cleansing of the streets on Sundays, at an estimated additional cost to that then incurred for Sunday work, of £212 8s. The result is that whereas only the market streets and some of the principal thoroughfares were under the old system attended to, nearly the whole of the Streets of the District are now cleansed on Sundays. The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. Bemoval or Snow. Snow fell during the month of January of the present year, and necessitated the employment of additional men for its removal. The bulk of the snow was carted to the Thames Embankment and thrown over the parapet wall into the Biver Thames, and a quantity was disposed of by flushing with water obtained from the New Biver Company's mains. The total cost of getting rid of the snow was £583 6s. 6d. Street-orderly Bins, &c. New street-orderly bins have been erected during the year as follows, viz.:— Broad Street 2 Great St. Andrew Street 1 Southampton Street 1 Chenies Street 2 Great Coram Street 1 51 The total number of bins now in the District is 52. Your Board has also placed additional bins for storing shell ballast for strewing upon the asphalte and wood pavements when their condition renders it desirable. The following list shows the position of those in the district at Lady-day last:— High Holborn 2 New Oxford Street 2 Tottenham Court Road 1 Store Street 1 Russell Square 1 Guilford Street 1 Southampton Row 1 Broad Street 1 Total 10 Cost op Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1893-94 was as follows:— £ s. d.

The watering of the public ways was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to E 2 52 water those courts and alleys in the District which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used (including that used for washing the streets) amounted to 6,839,000 gallons. During the hot summer months a small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts. £ s. d. The-amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 299 7 3 To contractors for horses, carts, and men 1,006 12 0 For permanganate of potash put into the water vans 24 0 0 Total £1,329 19 3 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,662 10s. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £16 15s. Limewhiting Courts. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £45 5s. 53 Bernard Mews Brunswick Mews.

The whole of the above urinals were painted during the year at a cost of £25. 54 Public Lighting, Your Board has for several years past had under consideration the question of street nomenclature at night by means of the public lamps, and have tried various modes by which the names of the streets could be made known, but none proved successful, and your Board last year decided to place 50 square lanterns of larger size with tablets containing the names of the streets in substitution of the present circular well lamps at the junctions of certain of the streets in the District. This has since been done and appears to give general satisfaction. As occasion has arisen during the year new circular lamps have been fixed in lieu of the old square lanterns ; the total number of the new lamps in the District at the present time is 922, each consuming 5 feet of gas per hour, and of the old square pattern lamps, 148. There are also 70 lamps of larger size at the corners of certain streets other than those above referred to, and on the crossing refuges, making a total of 1,140 public lamps in the District belonging to the Board. As in previous years, the lamps in the main public ways within the District were lighted during dark and foggy days at the cost of £3 4s. 7d. for the year. Street Refuges. A new street-crossing refuge was formed during the year at the south end of Bedford Place. The refuges now existing within the St. Giles District are as follows:— 55 In Bedford Place „ Broad Street „ Charing Cross Road Do. Do. ,, Endell Street „ Guilford Street „ High Holborn Do.

Miscellaneous. An important improvement was carried out during the year at the north-west corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields next Great Queen Street, a portion of the forecourts of the houses Nos. 66 and 67 being purchased by the Board, the wall and railings enclosing the forecouit were set back, allowing the roadway at this spot to be widened so as to admit of one additional vehicle passing. 56 Contracts.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending the 31st March, 1894. The total number of samples of food examined during this period was 266, a notable increase upon the preceding year when 220 were analysed. Of these 266 samples 130 were purchased by Inspector William Henry Bond and 136 by Inspector John Robinson. In the following table will be found a statement of the articles analysed during each quarter of the year. ARTICLE. let Quarter. 2 ad Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. Grand Total. Gen.

As usual a very large number of samples of milk were taken and the fact that 42 (or 25.6 per cent.) of the 164 were found to be adulterated, while 7 were certified as of poor quality, indicates the necessity of constant supervision of this most important article of food. The nature and amount of the adulteration was as follows :— No. of Sample. Nature and Amount of Adulteration. 1st Quarter (ending 30th June, 1893). G 19 At least 5 per cent, of fat abstracted.

BUTTER. Among the 26 samples of butter 5 or 19-2 per cent, were adulterated. These were all instances of the substitution of margarine for butter and were certified to contain at least 70 per cent, of foreign fat, that is, fat other than the fat of butter. PEPPER. One (12.5 per cent.) of the 8 samples of peeper was found to be mixed with foreign starch—probably wheat flower— to the extent of at least 12 per cent. 61 COFFEE. 20 specimens of coffee were submitted for analysis. Of these 3 proved to be adulterated with chicory, one with 25 per cent., one with 30 per cent., and the third with 32 per cent. SPIRITS, &c. The samples of spirits, vinegar aad margarine were all genuine and no adulteration or poisonous matter was detected in the samples of sausages, tinned salmon and beef.

During the year 1893 there were 1,094 births registered, 569 males and 525 females, being 168 births in excess of the registered corrected deaths. There was one birth to every 36.3 inhabitants, and the annual birth-rate was equal to 27.4 per 1,000; 0.9 per 1,000 lower than the rate for 1892, and the 10 years average. The birth-rate for St. George, Bloomsbury, is again a declining one, being 2.0 per 1,000 lower than the preceding year. The high birth-rate, 417 per 1,000 for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, is nearly double that of Bloomsbury. In Registration London the estimated population in the middle of 1893 was 4,306,411. The number of births during the year was 132,965, corresponding to an annual birth-rate of 31.0 per 1,000. 69 In England and Wales the population is estimated at 38,431,586 persons. During the year 914,182 births were registered, equal to a birth-rate of 30.7 per 1,000. The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 344,308. Deaths and Death-rate.

During 1893 the deaths registered in the three sub districts were St. George, Bloomsbury 180 St. Giles, South 342 St. Giles, North 189 Total 711 Of these, 361 were males and 350 females. 70 This number is corrected in the above table by including the deaths of parishioners in Hospitals, Asylums, &c., in out-lying parts of the Metropolis, and excluding the deaths of non-parishioners at the French Hospital, St. Giles Workhouse, and the British Lying-in Hospital, Public Institutions situated inside the District. The death-rate of St. Giles District for the year was 23.2 per 1,000, or one death to 42.9 inhabitants. This death-rate is only 0.1 above the average. The death-rate for St. George, Bloomsbury, is 2.4 lower than the previous year. In Registration London there were 91,536 deaths, equal to an annual death-rate of 21.3 per 1,000. In England and Wales 569,923 deaths were registered, and the death-rate was 19.2 per 1,000, corresponding with the mean rate in the ten yeas 1883-92. Infantile Mortality. There were 263 deaths of children under 5 years of age ; this mortality was in the proportion of 230 deaths to 1,000 births registered, and equivalent to 284 per 1,000 of total deaths. 155 infants died under 1 year, and 108 children between 1 and 5, which means that 263 children died before they reached 5 years of age. This number was 35 less than in 1892, and 72 lower than the average. The diseases which caused the greatest mortality were whooping-cough 17, diphtheria 18, diarrhoea 18, various forms of tuberculosis 29, bronchitis and pneumonia 53, suffocation in bed with parents 9, and atrophy 36. 71 Senile Mortality, 184 persons died at 65 years of age and upwards. 50 of the deaths occurred between 65 and 70 years of age. 88 „ „ „ 70 and 80 ,, ,, 35 „ „ „ 80 and 90 „ ,, 4 ,, ,, at 90 ,, ,, 2 ,, ,, at 91 ,, ,, 3 ,, ,, at 92 ,, ,, 2 „ „ at 93 ,, ,, 42 of these were certified to have died of old age, the remainder succumbed chiefly to diseases of the circulatory and respiratory organs. Uncertified Deaths. Only one was returned by the Registrar as not having been certified by a Registered Medical Practitioner or by the Coroner. This case, viz., a child set. 20 months, died from rickets, was reported to the Coroner, who considered that an inquest was unnecessary, as the deceased had frequently been under the care of a medical man. In St. Giles District the one case was equal to 0.l per cent.; throuohout England and Wales there were 14,336 cases, or 2.5 per cent, of the total deaths, in all London 0.9 per cent. The Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Death Certification concludes with the following recapitulation of its chief recommendations:— 1. That in no case should a death be registered without production of a certificate of the cause of death, signed by a registered Medical Practitioner, or by a Coroner after inquest. 72 2. That in each Sanitary District a registered Medical Practitioner should he appointed as Public Medical Certifier of the cause of death of cases in which a certificate from a Medical Practitioner in attendance is not forthcoming. 3. That a Medical Practitioner in attendance should be required before giving a certificate of death to personally inspect the body, but if on the ground of distance, or for other sufficient reason, he is unable to make this inspection himself, he should obtain and attach to the certificate of the cause of death a certificate signed by two persons, neighbours of the deceased, verifying the fact of death. 4. That Medical Practitioners should be required to send certificates of death to the Registrar instead of handing them to the representatives of the deceased. 5. That a form of certificate of death should be prescribed, and that in giving a certificate Medical Practitioners should be required to use such form. 6. That it should be made a penal offence to bury or otherwise dispose of a body, except in time of an epidemic, without an order from the Registrar stating the place and mode of disposal, which order, after it has been acted upon, should be returned to the Registrar who issued it. 7. That it should be made an offence to retain a dead body unburied, or otherwise legally disposed of, beyond a period not exceeding eight days, except by permission of a magistrate. 8. That the practice of burial in pits or common graves should be discontinued. 9. That still-births which have reached the stage of development of seven months should be registered upon the certificate of a registered Medical Practitioner, and that it should not be permitted to bury or otherwise dispose of the still-birth until an order for burial has been issued by the Registrar. Deaths in Public Institutions. (Within the District.) I. The Workhouse, Endell Street. At the Census 1891, the total number of inmates, including Officers, was:— 314 males 325 females (539 persons. 73 At the Casual Wards, Goldsmith Street:— 17 males 2 females 19 persons. During 1893, the number of deaths (excluding those which occurred at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum) was during 1st Quarter 44 2nd Quarter 38 3rd Quarter 32 4th Quarter 23 A total of 137 deaths. Equal to an annual death-rate of 21.4 per 1,000. II. The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. The Census of 1891 gives the total inmates of this hospital, including officers:— 29 males 38 females 67 persons. In 1893 there were 36 deaths reported; of the e, 30 were non-parishioners brought in for treatment from outside districts; Assuming that the number of inmates during the past year averaged 67, the death-rate was equal to 53.7 per 1,000. 17 of the causes of death were from diseases of the heart and lungs, 2 from enteric fever, and 17 from various diseases. III. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. During the year, 189 women were delivered in the hospital; the total number of children delivered was 189, of whom 3 were still-born. There were 4 deaths, all non-parishioners : 1 mother died 74 from "puerperal mania," and 3 children died shortly after birth from "convulsions" and "inanition," In the out-patient department 420 poor women were attended to during their confinement, of these 4 died ; 1 mother succumbed suddenly from heart disease of long standing, 1 from bronchitis and fatty heart, 1 from rupture of the womb, and 1 from blood-poisoning. Among the infants there were 9 still-births, and 6 died shortly after delivery. The medical report for the past year is that the sanitary condition of the hospital is in a fairly satisfactory state.

The twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund states that up to the end of the year 1893, the Trustees have provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London, 11,273 rooms, besides bath rooms, laundries, and wash-houses. These rooms comprise 5,070 separate dwellings. The number of persons in residence on the 31st December last, was 19,937. 77 The average weekly earnings of the head of each family was £1 3s. 7½d.; the average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9¼d. per week, and of each room, 2s. l¾d. The birth rate for the year was 35.1 per 1,000, the death-rate was 17.6 per 1,000. The infant mortality was 126.4 in each 1,000 births.

There were 5 births during the year, equal to a birth-rate of 24.5 per 1,000. The 5 deaths were below the average, and correspond to a death-rate of 24.5 per 1,000; all the deaths occurred from diseases of the heart and lungs. The conditions of occupation to be observed by the tenants in the several blocks of Artizans' Dwellings are set forth in the Annual Report for 1892. The Principal Zymotic Diseases, The seven principal diseases of the Zymotic class are small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whoopingcough, fever, and diarrhoea. 79 In all London, in 1893, these diseases caused 13,223 deaths equal to a Zymotic death-rate of 3.0 per 1,000. In England and Wales there were 73,499 deaths, corresponding to a Zymotic death-rate of 2.47 per thousand. In St. Giles District, the deaths from the same class of diseases were 91, equivalent to a Zymotic death-rate of 2.2 per 1,000. MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—Small-Pox. The deaths from small-pox in London, during 1893, were 206, the corrected decennial average being 305, during the same period 2,933 cases were notified. At the beginning of 1893 it was reported, "that smallpox has steadily prevailed during the last quarter of the year 1892, and not only does the number of places (in the United Kingdom) tend to increase, but the number of persons notified to be suffering from the disease is also on the increase." At the end of the first week in January, 38 small-pox patients belonging to various Metropolitan parishes were receiving treatment at the Hospital Ships; this number increased week by week, until it reached its maximum of 569 cases on May the 13th. From that date to the end of September the number declined to 77. From September to November 18th, the number gradually rose to 151. From the end of that month to the end of the year it again fell to 93. HO During the present epidemic the majority of the cases, both in London and country, have been traced to the tramo class, who have no fixed residence. The strongest evidence in support of this is the following report from the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital Ships to the Managers of the Asylums Board, to that effect "Of the cases which have been admitted recently (January), comparatively few have been persons with a settled residence. The sources of infection in these cases, except in a few instances where more than one person of the same family or household has been attacked, have not been discovered, and the disease has no doubt been contracted in a chance way by such persons coming in contact with infected persons in the streets or elsewhere. I wish to point out that the disease has yet got but little hold upon the settled population of London. It has been imported by tramps and others from the provinces, and such importation is continuing, is likely to continue, and cannot be prevented. This class, which so far has been almost entirely affected, is the vagrant class; and the disease is being spread by persons of this class coming in coutact with one another in the casual wards of Workhouses and other places. In most of the cases the disease appears to have been contracted in one of the casual wards, and many have been sent here from casual wards and workhouse infirmaries. It is useless for me to supply you with information about such cases, because, owing to the migratory habits of these persons, it is difficult to say in which particular casual ward the disease was contracted, and because you may take it that almost every casual ward in London is acting as a source of infection." 81 Sir Edwin H. Galsworthy, Chairman of the Asylums' Board, directed a copy of this report to be sent to every Medical Officer of Health in the Metropolis with the view "for the adoption of some measures for preventing the further spread of the disease in London, and suggesting that one most effective means to that end would be a systematic Medical inspection of casual wards, shelters, common lodging-houses, &c., through the agency of which it would appear there is risk of the disease being widely disseminated." Upon receipt of the letter and extract from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, I sent the following circular letter to the several owners of the common lodginghouses (49) in this District, as an inducement for them to report to the proper authorities the existence of illness among their inmates :— 197, High Holborn, W.C. Sanitary Department, February, 1893. Sir, Small-pox has again broken out in London. Most of the sufferers have been persons who frequent casual wards, shelters, and common lodging-houses, and whose mode of life has peculiar facilities for spreading infection. It is most desirable to arrest and stamp out the disease if possible, may I therefore ask you in the event of any persons, who may lodge at your house, complaining of sickness, that you will immediately obtain from the Believing Officer at Short's Gardens, a Medical Order. The symptoms of small-pox in its earlier stages are usually bad pains in the head and back, and general sickness, followed by a rash. May I ask if any persons lodging in your house exhibit signs of this sickness to immediately communicate with me. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOYETT, Medical Officer of Health. G 82 Most of the common lodging-house keepers cordially fell in with my suggestion, and I recognise the valuable assistance which was accorded to me by them. In St. Giles' District during the epidemic of 1884-5, there were 181 cases reported, of which 37 were fatal, with the exception of two doubtful cases in 1887 and 1891, the District was free from the disease until 1892, when 7 slight cases were notified. During 1893, 66 persons were attacked, of whom 4 died, viz., 2 adults and 2 children ; only 2 of the patients were treated at their own homes, the rest were removed to the hospital ships. 27 of the removals were from the Casual Ward and the common lodging-houses in the parish of St. Giles-inthe-Fields. By the end of September the District was free from the disease. I may here mention that the telephonic communication, between your Board's offices and the several establishments of the Asylums' Board, has been of great service for securing the speedy removal of patients to hospital. 2.—measles. The 5 deaths from measles were considerably below the average, and 42 less than the number recorded in the previous year. The Local Government Board has not yet included measles amongst the notifiable diseases. I am still of opinion that the notification of it would enable measures to be taken for arresting the spread of the disease, and so saving many infantile lives. 83 Unfortunately, many parents consider measles a slight ailment, and rarely seek for Medical aid, until serious affections of the lungs set in, and cause death. 3.— Scarlet Fever. In 1893 this disease was again epidemic in tte Metropolis, no less than 36,901 cases having been notified to the several Sanitary authorities, the deaths likewise were considerably above the average. In St. Giles District there were 235 cases notified, of these 141 were treated at the various Metropolitan Hospitals—there were 12 deaths, 8 being children under five years of age. The Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board state in their Annual Report; "We have again to record a considerable increase in the number of fever and small-pox patients admitted to the Manager's Hospitals. In the seven years which have passed since 1886, the total annual admissions (small-pox and fever cases) have been 6,956, 5,219, 5,777, 8,361, 7,873, 16,624, and 21,129 respectively. Whether the very high figures of the past two years were entirely due to the effects of compulsory notification and the increased popularity of the Manager's Hospitals, or whether there was not a somewhat greater prevalence of scarlet fever, diphtheria, and small-pox amongst an increased population, we have not, owing to the comparatively recent establishment of compulsory notification in London, sufficient evidence to prove." 4.—Diphtheria. The following table shows the number of deaths and death-rates per 1,000 from diphtheria in England and Wales, g 2 84 London, and St. Giles District, during the year 1893. No. of Deaths. Rate peb 1000. England and Wales 8,918 0.3 London 3,265 0.7 St. Giles District 21 0.5 It will be seen from this return that there has been of late an alarming increase of diphtheria throughout the country, and the mortality has been without precedent. The disease has been principally confined to children during the school age, three to ten. In London, in proportion to population, there has been the highest fatality in the Central Districts. It is considered the unusual dry weather which prevailed throughout a greater portion of the year has been a factor in the increase of cases of the disease. Dr. Sweeting, in a paper read before the Epidemiological Society, gives a statistical account of cases of diphtheria occurring during convalescence from scarlet fever, and shows that "post scarlatinal diphtheria" has occurred regularly at most of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board. He suggests that the aggregation of acute cases of scarlet fever may have had some influence in fostering an outbreak of subsequent diphtheria. Dr. Sweeting, in common with a large number of the most eminent physicians, does not find that the Sanitary or administrative surroundings of the patients have had any marked importance in the spread of the disease, whilst others hold that all causes, such as damp, cold, and sewer gas, which produced sore throat, were predisposing conditions of diphtheria. 85 In the Supplement of the 21st. Annual Report of the Local Government Board, 1891—1892, in the Reports of Dr. Klein and Dr. Sidney Martin, the pathological nature of diphtheria is established. Dr. Klein announces his opinion that the true cause of the disease is the bacillus discovered by Klebbs, and Loffler, whilst Dr. Martin proves in a convincing manner how the bacillus exerts its baneful influence. Dr. Klein further considers that the so-called "Scarlatinal diphtheria" is not true diphtheria. The 21 deaths in the St. Giles District in 1893 were 7.1 in excess of the decennial average. 5.—whooping-cough. 18 children died from this disease, this number was 5 below the average, 17 of the deaths were under five years of age. 6.—fever. No notifications of typhus, nor of simple and ill defined forms of fever were recorded throughout the year. 34 cases of typhoid, or enteric fever were reported, of which 6 were fatal. 15 of the patients were removed to the various hospitals. The death-rate from fever was 4.7 below the average. The Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board report that during the year 20,885 fever, diphtheria, and small-pox patients were removed from their homes to the various hospitals of the managers. Altogether 36,976 removals were effected by the land ambulance service during 1893, and the various vehicles made 24,017 journeys, and ran 245,311 miles. 86 The steamboats of the river ambulance service conveyed 10,652 passengers to and from the hospital ships at Long Reach. DIARRHCEAL ORDER. 7.—Diarrhœa. The 25 deaths from diarrhoea were identical with the decennial average. Like whooping-cough this disease was especially fatal to children, for it carried off 18 lives under five years. Cholera. In 1892-3, cholera raged in various parts of the Continent, whilst England enjoyed a remarkable immunity from it. The disease having reappeared this year in Russia, and other Continental cities, the Local Government Board issued the following circular letter and memorandum to Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis, with a view of organising precautionary measures against the possible introduction of cholera into London. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. June 22nd, 1893. CHOLERA. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to call attention to their circular letter of the 25th August, last, in which, in view of the severe outbreak of cholera, which was then occurring in Hamburg, they reminded Sanitary Authorities of the responsibilities and duties devolving upon them in connection with the organization of measures of precaution against the possible introduction of the disease in London. 8 7 I am now to forward, for the information of the Sanitary Authority, the accompanying copy of a memorandum by the Board's Medical Officer, from which it will be seen that there is reason for Sanitary Authorities preparing in advance to prevent the extension of any cholera that may be imported into their districts during the ensuing season. The Board last year, in their circular already referred to, called attention to the powers vested in them under section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and section 82 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to issue Epidemic Regulations imposing upon Sanitary Authorities the duty of making arrangements for the prevention and treatment of cholera. Those arrangements would comprise the appointment of Committees for the purpose of carrying out the Regulations, the division of the Sanitary District into special areas, the appointment of Medical visitors for the visitation of the poorer houses, and the detection of cholera and diarrhoea, the supply of Medical attendance and nursing, and of medicine and disinfectants, and the provision of dispensaries and of such additional hospitals and places of refuge as might be necessary for the several parishes and districts; the hospitals being provided for the reception of those cholera patients, who could not properly be treated in their own homes, and the places of refuga for the lodgment of those persons not actually sick, whom it might be right to keep under observation, or to accommodate while their homes were either under disinfection, or were devoted to sick persons who could not properly be removed. As the Sanitary Authority are aware, the necessity for the issue of Regulations of this nature happily did not arise last year, but in view of the possible recurrence of cholera during the approaching summer and autumn in continental ports with which this country is in rapid and close communication, the Board think it right that the Sanitary Authority should take into their early consideration the question of their readiness to meet any emergency that may arise. I am, therefore, to request that the Board may be informed, not later than the first week in the coming month, how far the preliminary action taken last year, or since decided on by the Sanitary Authority may be regarded as enabling them without undue delay to perform the duties, which would devolve on them in the event of the Board finding it necessary to issue regulations of the kind referred to. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HUGH OWEN, Secretary. To the Clerk to the Sanitary Authority. 88 MEMORANDUM OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD AS TO CHOLERA. Asiatic Cholera first made its appearance in England in 1831-2. Including both the epidemic of that date and the occurence of imported cases of the disease last autumn, there have been seven occasions on which cholera has found its way into this country. On the first four occasions ending with the outbreak of 1866, the disease succeeded in establishing itself amongst us in epidemic form. But on the three subsequent occasions it was practically limited to imported cases, and no extension took place. On five of the seven occasions referred to cholera travelled across Russia to Baltic Ports ; and when the disease has followed this route it has commonly extended also to continental ports on the North Sea and the British Channel. The disease has several times reached England from these ports, notably from Hamburg, and when this has been the case its incidence on this country has not been greatest during the first year of its European prevalence, but on recrudescence of the infection in the second or even the third year. The present memorandum does not profess to suggest any explanation of this occurence. Neither is it intended to imply that the same sequence of events will necessarily occur again. But it may be noted that whereas a considerable portion of the summer of 1892 was taken up with the diffusion of cholera across the continent of Europe, the disease only reaching ports on the North sea and British Channel in the month of August, recrudescence of the disease this year along the coast line of Western Europe may well occur at a date which would involve danger to this country during a longer term of our summer and autumn season than was the case last year. As yet there are happily no indications of any general recurrence of cholera either in North Sea or Baltic Ports; but, notwithstanding this, occasional attacks of that disease have taken place during the present year in Hamburg, and in the adjacent town of Altona. In the French Department of Morbihan, Province of Brittany, cholera has hardly ceased to prevail since the beginning of November, 1892. The disease is still present there, over 200 deaths having been recorded from that Department during the months of March, April, and May of this year. The largest portion of this mortality has fallen on the port-town of Lorient. The disease has also shown itself at other points on the French coast. Having regard to these circumstances, it is important that the Sanitary Authorities of England and Wales should be prepared in 89 advance to prevent extension of any cholera that may be imported into their districts, and this duty devolves especially on the Authorities of tho3e districts into which cases of imported cholera are most likely to make their way. R. THORNE THORNE, June 8th, 1893. Medical Officer. In reply, your Board ordered a copy of my Report to be forwarded to the Local Government Board as to the course to be adopted should cholera unfortunately be imported into the district. The several arrangements are detailed as follows:— 1.—Hospital Accommodation.* I assume that the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, as heretofore, will constitute itself the first line of defence, for which purpose they will requisition the available beds at the several Hospitals and Public Institutions in the County of London, and will apportion them to the various districts, according to urgency and demands. With the exception of the French Hospital, all this accommodation will be situated outside the St. Giles District, and as it is, in my opinion, extremely desirable that cholera patients should be treated at the shortest possible distance from their own homes, I would, therefore, urge the desirability of some arrangements being made for the provision of temporary hospital accommodation within the District, either by utilizing some of the vacant land of the London County Council on the Shelton Street area, or by some other means. I think that accommodation ought to be provided for at least 30 persons. * On the 25th August I received a communication from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, giving a list of the Hospitals and Infirmaries which have promised to provide accommodation for patients, viz.:— 90 Name of Sanitary District in which the accommodation is situate. No. of Beds. In what Building. Central Division of Metropolis. St. Martin-in-theFields 15 Charing Cross Hospital, Strand, W.C. Strand 10 French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, W.C. Do 1 King's College Hospital, Portugal Street, W.C. St. Giles 50 St. Giles Infirmary, Endell Street, W.C. Holborn 4 Italian Hospital, 40, Queen's Square, W.C. City 20 St. Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, E.C. 2.—Refuges. When the question of accommodation for persons not actually suffering from the disease was discussed last year, the Committee authorised the Officers of the Board to make use of the premises No. 198, High Holborn. This house, however, is, I am informed by the Clerk to the Board, not now available, and it is therefore, in my opinion, extremely desirable that some such accommodation should be provided. It has suggested itself to me, that on a great emergency, certain of the waiting rooms at the Coroner's Court, Goldsmith Street, might be set apart as a temporary refuge, which would not interfere with the object for which the building is at present used, but I think it is highly desirable that communication should be entered into with the owners of closed premises in the district, with a view of their being let to the Board for the purpose. 3.—Removal of Patients. The Metropolitan Asylums' Board, has written to me to say that it will be prepared to provide hand-litters, placed at convenient situations, for the removal of the sick. 91 In a further communication, dated the 25th August last, the same Board has given directions "if cholera appear in an epidemic form in London," that ambulances will be placed in the folio ving stations for the use of patients in this District. St. Giles.—Stone Yard, Board of Works, High Holborn, w.c. Mortuary at Workhouse, Endell Street, W.C. King's College Hospital, Portugal Street, W.C. 4.—Nursing. The National Nursing Association of 23, Bloomsbury Square has kindly placed at my disposal 5 or 6 nurses in the event of their services being required. 5.—Medical Attendance. I have not at the present time made any arrangements for medical visitors or attendants, but I think that the District should be divided into at least four areas in the first instance viz., north, south, east, and west, and I suggest that the following Medical Practitioners in the District should be asked if they would be willing to attend cholera patients, and if so, on what terms ? (Here follows the names of 10 Medical Practitioners, many others can be added to the list, if their services should be required). 6.—Supply of Medicines. Messrs. Carr & Co., 171, High Holborn, W.C., Mr. J. K. Matterson, 108, New Oxford Street, W.C., and Mr. G. S. 92 Boutall, 52, Marchmont Street, W.C., have agreed to supply medicines during all hours of the day and night at a reasonable rate. 7.—Disinfection. On this head, I think that I may congratulate the Board on being perfectly prepared. The "Washington Lyon" disinfecting apparatus, which the Board provided last year has been found to answer admirably, and I have no hesitation in saying that so far as the disinfection of infected clothing is concerned we shall be well able to deal with the same. 8.—Destruction of Infected Bedding and Clothing. I have communicated with Mr. George Cookson, the Board's Contractor, who is prepared to continue the arrangement entered into with him last year for the removal in covered vans of infected bedding and clothing, which he is prepared to burn in the destructor erected at his wharf in Tin worth Street, Albert Embankment, S.W. 9. —Disinfectants. The contracts entered into by the Board with Messrs. Adcock, Easton & Co., and with Professor Tuson's Disinfectant Company, Limited, provide for the delivery of an unlimited supply, and, having regard to the manner in which thtse firms have hitherto performed their contracts, I entertain no doubt of their being not found wanting in the event of emergency arising. 10.—Removal and Interment of the Dead. The separate chamber at the mortuary in Goldsmith Street, set apart for the reception of infectious bodies, 93 is sufficiently large to deal with any serious outbreak, and as the mortuary keeper resides upon the premises, bodies can be received at any time of the day or night. With regard to the interment of the dead the arrangements which were entered into last year, with Mr. C. H. Perryman, of 14, Little Queen Street, W.C., and the London Necropolis, and National Mausoleum Company, of 2, Lancaster Place, Strand, W.C., should, I think, be renewed. The Lancet of September, 1893, gives the following comment of the outbreak:— " Last year there were epidemics of cholera, which seemed to have started from different centres and pursued different and independent courses. That which was nearest to us in Europe and earliest in point of time, commenced in a limited but sudden and fatal outbreak in an overcrowded prison at Nanterre, close to the Seine, in April of last year, and afterwards in the suburbs of Paris; the disease subsequently prevailing, though not to any great extent, amongst various towns and places in France, and extending to Rouen and Havre. The starting point of the other larger and more formidable epidemic was assumed to be from India, by way of Afghanistan and Herat, through Asiatic Russia, and along the Caspian, until it reached various places in Russia, and St. Petersburg itself, and going south westward, Hamburg, where it occasioned the violent outbreak that commenced in August of last year, in which 18,000 persons were attacked, and over 8,000 died. Hamburg has always been a principal source of danger to this country." In an interesting address on cholera nurseries, and their suppression, delivered at the Sanitary Congress, Edinburgh, 94 in July last, Mr. Ernest Hart, said, "I claim to have now established on an overwhelming basis of evidence collected from every part of Europe, the dicta, founded upon the original investigations by Snow and Simon on the British epidemics of 1848 and 1854, and by myself and Radcliffe of the East London epidemic of 1866 : 1. That cholera is a filth disease, carried by dirty people to dirty places, and diffused by specifically poisoned water. 2. That you may eat cholera, and drink cholera, but you cannot catch cholera. 3. That cholera may be considered for all practical purposes as an exclusively water carried disease, and that it is carried only by water poisoned by human discharges. 4. Cholera can find no lodgment where the whole of the potable water is absolutely pure and unpolluted. No suspicious case of the disease was reported in this District. No parishioner died from English Cholera, and the deaths from ordinary diarrhoea were only about the decennial average. The precautionary measures taken in 1893 will continue to enable any possible outbreak of the disease being promptly dealt with, should it unfortunately occur in the present year. Other Miasmatic Diseases. Influenza. During the year, the disease, though of a milder type than in former epidemics, has been distributed pretty generally throughout the country, and, at times, has been fatally prevalent. 95 In London the excess of deaths, at times, from diseases of the lungs and respiratory organs, may fairly be attributed to influenza. Further reports have been presented to Parliament on Epidemic Influenza, Dr. Parsons dealing with the statistical and general aspect of the disease, whilst Dr. Klein has supervised the clinical and bacteriological features. The following are some extracts of the digest of the statistical evidence of Dr. Parsons' report, by Dr. Thorne Thorne, C.B., the principal Medical Officer of the Local Government Board:— "A study of the report shows distinctly that these epidemics followed different courses, and that their incidence on locality varied considerably so far as the Metropolis is concerned. The influenza death-rates in the three calendar years 1890, 1891, and 1892, were 146, 544, and 531 per 1,000,000 living, respectively. But the onset of the last two epidemics was much less sudden than was the case in the winter of 1889-90, and it is probable that there were fewer attacks in the more recent prevalences than in the first one, yet the latter epidemics were both more protracted and more fatal. Whilst, however, this was the case in London, almost the opposite took place elsewhere. No condition of site, soil, climate, sanitary circumstances, occupation, or other have yet been elicited which afford any satisfactory explanation of these differing incidences. It is noteworthy that the rate of death due to influenza was substantially greater in rural and sparsely populated areas than in large towns. The death-rate from influenza increases with advancing age. To Dr. Parsons it seems clear 'that the disease is transported by human agency, and spreads from person to person mainly or solely." 96 "The disease would seem to have been more fatal to males in middle and advanced life than to females, whilst children have enjoyed a comparative immunity. It is believed that the disease is communicable at a very early stage. "Dr. Parsons does not recommend the notification of influenza as a general measure. He calls attention to the advisability of attention to disinfection of the discharges from the bronchial tubes and nostrils. "The evidence advanced both by Dr. Klein and Dr. Pareons, is opposed to the theory that the disease called influenza in horses is identical with that of man." The mortality from Influenza in St. Giles' District for the three years, 1890, 1891, and 1892, was 10, 31, and 29, respectively. In 1893, 18 deaths were recorded; of these 3 were children under five years, and 8 were old people above 65 years. Diseases of the Respiratory System. The diseases of the respiratory organs caused 363 of the total deaths, of these 116 were due to phthisis or consumption. Lung diseases other than consumption, represented by bronchitis and inflammation of the lungs, were fatal to the remaining 247 persons. Of course, it was in the cold quarters of the year, the first and last, that these deaths were in excess. The extremes of age, the very young and old, succumbed principally to these diseases. Housing of the Working Glasses Act, 1890, (53 and 54 Vict., cap. 70.) During the past year 14 houses were represented as unfit for human habitation. If these be added to those pre- 97 viously reported, it will show that 120 properties have been dealt with in this District since the passing of the Act. Street or Place.

A letter was received 28th January from the London County Council, asking what arrangements had been made for carrying out in this District the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, with reference to the sanitary inspection of workshops under the Factory Act of 1891, especially (a) to the general state of cleanliness, and repair of the workshops, (b) to the amount of cubic space allotted to each worker, (c) to the adequacy or inadequacy of the means of ventilation provided, and (d) to the extent to which Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, which relates to the provision of sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences is complied with. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter.

During the past year 86 bodies were received there by order of the Coroner, and at the request of friends of the deceased; 4 were brought in by the Police. Inquests were held in 59, and post-mortem examinations were made in 43 cases. 5 who died from infectious diseases were deposited in the chamber set apart for that purpose. 6 were non-parishioners, who died outside the District, and were removed to the Mortuary to meet the convenience of the relatives, and the Jury. Sometimes this is done when 109 the deceased is of the Jewish persuasion, or when the body should be interred without delay for Sanitary or other reasons. Place for Post-mortem Examinations.
