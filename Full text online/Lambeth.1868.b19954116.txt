(Ry Order) THOMAS ROFFEY, Vestry Clerk. 10 annual report FOR THE YEAR 1868-69, BY GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D. Gentlemen, In again presenting an Annual Report on the health and mortality of Lambeth, which constitutes one eighteenth part of the area and population of the entire Metropolis, it is satisfactory to know that notwithstanding the overcrowded state of many of the dwellings of the working classes, and the extraordinary heat and drought of the summer, the Parish of Lambeth has not been unhealthy. During the year 1868, the births were more numerous than in any previous year, amounting to 7871; exceeding those of 1867, by 484; those of 1866 by 788; and those of 1865 by 1019. The births in the first quarter of the year were 2016; in the second quarter 2028; in the third quarter 1835; and in the fourth quarter 1992. The deaths recorded in 1868 were 4145; the excess of births over deaths for the year being 3426; in 1867 the births exceeded the deaths by 3334; in 1866 by 2914; and in 1865 by 2743. In the first quarter of 1868, the deaths were 1066; in the second quarter 1074; in the third quarter 1162; and in the fourth quarter 1143. The births and deaths during each quarter of the year in each of the eight Ecclesiastical Divisions of the Parish, are shown in Table II, from which it will also be seen that in the Waterloo Road, 1st part district, there were 602 births, and 351 deaths during the year; in the Waterloo Road, 2nd part district, 979 births, and 406 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 1st part district, 801 births, and 419 deaths; in the Lambeth Church, 11 second part district, 1644 births, and 1209 deaths, 331 of which occurred in the Workhouse; in the Kennington, 1st part districts, 1.529 births, and 799 deaths; in the Kennington, 2nd part district, 932 births, and 548 deaths; in the Brixton district, 981 births, and 515 deaths; and in the Norwood district, 403 births, and 198 deaths, 14 of which occurred in the Children's Workhouse. The death-rate of Lambeth has been calculated as usual at Table III at the same rate of increase of population which took place in the Parish and its districts, between the decennial peried of the two last Census's 1851 and 1861; but as the population has increased much more rapidly during the last seven years in some districts, the calculation cannot be taken as correct It is probably nearly correct in the four inner districts, but in the outer districts of the Parish, the increase of population has been greater, esjHeiallv in the Kennington 2nd part district, which in* creased slowly between and 1861, and by the Table would now appear one of the least healthy districts of Lambeth, whereas it is really very healthy, the difference arising from the population being reckoned as only having increased 1158 in seven years, although 900 houses have been built during that time in that district, and the population in it has doubtless increased quite Estimiated according to Table III, the most healthy districts during the year were the Norwood district, in which the death-rate was 182 per ten thousand of the population, or excluding the Children's Workhouse, only 177 per ten thousand; the Brixton district, 209 per ten thousand; the Lambeth Church, 1st part, 200 per ten thousand; the Waterloo Road, 1st part, 215 per ten thousand; the Waterloo Road, 2nd part, 217 per ten thousand; the Kennington, first part, 222 per ten thousand; the less healthy districts, being the Kennington 2nd part, 253 per ten thousand; and the Lambeth Church, 2nd part, 383 per ten thousand, or excluding the Workhouse 288 per ten thousand of the population. The death-rate of the 12 tire Parish, being apparently higher than usual, 246 per ten thousand arising partly from fifty-three weeks, being included in this year instead of fifty-two, and from the population being really greater than stated. For in the seven years the number of births in the Parish have increased twenty-five percent. and if the population has increased in the same ratio, the population would amount to upwards of 215,000, instead of 180,290 persons, which would give an exceedingly favourable death-rate; but even taking the population at having increased to only 180,290, the annual death-rate of Lambeth for a number of years past, compares favourably with that of the whole of England, which is the more remarkable as the death-rate of most town districts, owing in a great measure to density of population is high. The Registrar General has shown that with the exception of the West district of the Metropolis, the South district, of which Lambeth forms a part, has been the most healthy every year for the last six years. In his summary of weekly returns for the Metropolis for the year, he remarks "the improvement in the annual rate of mortality, is most striking in South London where the Sewage stagnated, and the water supply was drawn directly from the Thames, charged with Sewage down to year 185G. The mortality there was at the rate of 38 and 35 per thousand, in the years 1849 and 1854 ; during the average of five years 1840-44, it was 25, of five years, l845-49, it was 28, and during the five years, 1850-54, it was 26; in 185559, it fell to 23; in 1860-64, it was 23; and in 1865 68, it ranged from 22 to 24; in the last year it was 23. The mortality is now lower in South London then it is in North London." The deaths from Epidemic diseases during 1868, are shown in Table IV, they amounted to 997, and were in the proportion of nearly 22½ per cent of the mortality from all causes. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea were 261, Whooping Cough 211, Scarlet Fever 192, Fever 155, Measles 120, Small 13 Pox 37, and Diptheria 21. With the exception of Small Pox and Diptheria the deaths from Epidemic diseases, were more numerous than 1867. The number of cases of Illness arising from Epidemic diseases occurrin amongst the poor, and attended by the Poor Law Medical Officers, during the year 1868 are shown in Table V, from which it will bo seen that 647 cases of Diarrhoea occurred. The greatest number 437 in the 3rd quarter of the year; 235 cases of Measles; the greatest number 93 in the 2nd quarter; 202 cases of Scarlet Fever, the greatest number 66 in the 2nd quarter; 155 cases of Whooping Cough, the greatest number 54 in the 1st quarter; 109 cases of Small Pox, the greatest number 33 in the second quarter; and 61 cases of Fever, (including thyphus and Typhoid) the greatest number 40 in the 3rd quarter of the year. A large amount of Sanitary work was effected. In Table I is shown the number and nature of nuisances brought under the notice of the General Purposes Committee, with the results, and Sanitary improvements carried out. The number of nuisances removed or abated, and Sanitary improvements effected amounted to 5,007, consisting of 758 house in a dirty or unwholesome state cleansed or whitewashed; 353 houses provided with ventilation; 268 dilapidated houses, repaired; 356 houses with bad drainage, drained; 139 Cesspools, emptied or abolished; 532 obstructed drains, remedied; 246 privies and closet drains, improved; 137 detective drains, tiapped; 182 yards paved and improved; 252 water receptacles improved; 196 houses provided with water supply; 410 dust bins erected; 61 dangerous structures remved ; 6 trade nuisances abated; 9 smoke nuisances remedied; 5 offensive smells in houses from dampness abated; 26 obstructed gullies, and 20 foul urinals cleansed; 576 accumulations of dung, garbage, &c., removed; 39 lots of swine, consisting of 163 pigs, removed ; 20 lots of unwholesome fish seized, conveyed to the Police Courts, 14 and destroyed by Magistrates orders, the fiah consisting of 960 unwholesome plaice, 680 unwholesome mackerel, 25.10 unwholesome herrings, 216 unwholesome haddocks, and 76 unwholesome crabs. One lot of unwholesome meat, weighing 516 lbs.; and one lot of unwholesome bread, weighing 146 lbs. were destroyed, 21 premises were inspected for Licenses for storing Petroleum, 211 bakehouses whitewashed. There were 112 applications for Licenses for slaughterhouses, of which 110 were renewals, and were not opposed. Two new applications for Licenses were opposed at the Newington Sessions, and the Licenses refused. There were 96 applications for Licenses for cowhouses, of which 90 were renewals, and 6 were new applications (one of which was in lieu of an old license discontinued). Three of the new applications were opposed at the Newington Sessions, and the Licenses refused. All the slaughterhouses and cowhouses were whitewashed several times during the year. For the removal of nuisances and accomplishment of Sanitary works, 1,142 notices were required to be served, and 39 summonses and Magistrates orders obtained. A Sausage maker was fined £10 and costs for manufacturing sausages with materials unfit for food. The Workshops Regulation Act came into force, its provisions were made known by being printed and circulated throughout the Parish. In one instance, young women were found employed at hours contrary to the Act, but being the first offence a caution only was given on a promise that the offence should not be repeated. I remain, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE PUCKLE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
