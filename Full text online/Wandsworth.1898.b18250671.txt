The Conference also considered the subject of Generating Stations for the supply of Electricity in bulk, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— THE TELEPHONE SERVICE. 1.—"That in the opinion of this Conference the present telephone service of the London area, as supplied by the National Telephone Company, is both inefficient and inadequate; that the charges, as compared with those made by the same Company in the provinces, are much too high, and that these disadvantages to London are largelydue to the abandonment by the Post Office of that principle of competition which was expressly adopted prior to 1892 for the protection of telephone users." 2.—"That this Conference views with alarm the action of the Post Office in using, for the benefit of the National Telephone Company, its special powers as to the breaking up of streets, as instanced in the recent case of the Commissioners of Sewers and the Post Office; and urges the Select Committee on Telephones, which is now 14 sitting at the House of Commons, to preserve intact that control over streets which has hitherto been vested in the Municipal Authorities." 3.—"That in the opinion of this Conference the telephone service is of such general public importance, and calculated to become of such general benefit that it ought no longer to remain exclusively in the hands of a trading corporation, but be worked by the Government as a portion of the postal service of the country." 4.—"That in the event of the Post Office not undertaking a telephone service it is desirable that the Local and Central Authorities of the London telephone district should at once combine to secure an efficient and cheap municipal telephone service." GENERATING STATIONS FOR ELECTRICITY IN BULK. 1.—"That this Conference regards it as essential to the interests of London as a whole that the present purchase clause of the Electric Lighting Acts, which applies to defined areas should also be made to apply to such Companies as propose to supply electrical energy in bulk to the whole of London without regard to area." 2—"That while preserving intact the rights of the Local Authorities with regard to electric lighting and energy, in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that the London County Council should be in a position to undertake, if it is so determined, and if so requested by the Local Authorities, the supply of electrical energy in bulk for the convenience of any districts desiring to be so supplied, provided that the Council does not become competitive with the Local Authorities." 3.—"That in the opinion of this Conference power should be retained to the Local Authority to object to overhead wires for traction purposes and to have a provisional veto against the granting of an order to any private company." 4.—"That with reference to Question 1—Answer (b), of the report of the Joint Select Committee, this Conference is of opinion that all existing undertakings should share in the advantages suggested by these clauses." 5.—"That as regards Question 3 in the report of the Joint Select Committee, this Conference is of opinion that it should be left to the Local Authority to decide the route." 6.—-"That the Chairman of the Highways Committee of the London County Council be empowered to present to Parliament the resolutions arrived at by the Conference with reference to the supply of electricity in bulk." 15 Mr. J. W. Benn, the Chairman of the Highways Committee of the London County Council, gave evidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Telephone Service which appeared to diverge from the opinions expressed at the Conference above referred to, and the Board therefore passed the following resolutions, viz.:— x.—That having regard to the opinions expressed by Mr. J. W. Benn on the 16th and 21st June, 1898, before the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the Telephone Service, and their divergence from those expressed by the representatives of the Local Authorities, and particularly by the representatives of this Board, at the conference held on the 14th June, 1898, on this subject, and on behalf of whom Mr. Benn was giving evidence, this Board thinks it of importance to record its views as follows :— (a) That the telephone service is already of so great public portance and is calculated to become of such general use and benefit that it ought to be exclusively exercised by Government, and for the reason (amongst others) that it is essential for a successful service that it be under one and the same supreme and exclusive authority for the whole country. (b) That it is not desirable that the telephone service should be undertaken by the London County Council and the other Local Authorities, whether in competition with or after purchase from the National Telephone Company. (c) That the Post Office should not undertake a distinct telephone service in competition with the National Telephone Company, but that on terms to be arrived at by arbitration or other means, mutually agreed, should take over the undertaking and property of the Company. Copies of the foregoing resolutions were forwarded to the Rt. Hon. R. W. Hanbury, M.P., Chairman of the Select Committee, the Prime Minister, the Postmaster-General, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to the Members of Parliament and of the London County Council for the several districts represented by this Board; also to the London County Council, and 16 to all the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, with an invitation to them to pass similar resolutions and to act in accordance therewith. The Government announced their intention to establish a telephone service in the London area in competition with the National Telephone Company's system, and introduced into Parliament the Telegraphs (Telephonic Communication, &c.) Bill with that object, and to authorise the larger Local Authorities in the country to establish telephone systems. The Board being of opinion that it is necessary for the successful working of the service that it should be undertaken by the Government for the whole country presented a memorial to the First Lord of the Treasury, which, after setting out the proceedings of the Select Committee and quoting the above-mentioned resolutions, submitted the following objections to the proposal, viz.:— ******** 6.—It appears to your Memorialists that the proposed mode of dealing with the extra Metropolitan Districts would lead to a most unsatisfactory state of things. The proposal is to confer powers upon any of the larger Local Authorities who may apply for a licence to establish services of their own, with liberty to make arrangements with outlying Local Authorities for including the same in their own areas. Your Memorialists submit that even if the Local Authorities generally were to take the matter in hand there would be at best several disjointed services, which could not possibly form a good national service, or be conducted on any reliable system, and that there is no means of securing that these services shall be undertaken in a manner' that will confer the greatest amount of public benefit; whereas if one system for the whole country were planned and carried out methodically and with a view to the public interest it could be constructed as a connected whole, in a most economical manner, and would render the maximum amount of service. Your Memorialists agree with the Select Committee that a Telephone Service cannot, like a service for the supply of gas, water, or electric light, be treated as a purely local or isolated industry, but that it forms part of "a national system the general efficiency of which largely depends upon its uniformity and the equal facilities afforded for communication everywhere." 7.—It was stated on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the 17 House of Commons that in granting licences conditions would be imposed insisting upon free inter-communication between the rival system throughout the country, and that the holders of these licences should not impose terminals on one another or against the Post Office. These conditions were said to be essential. But as every Local Authority would be independent it would be impossible to enforce any such covenants except by a revocation of the licence, and this would be no remedy as it would be destroying the very objects of the scheme —a universal service. As there would be a large number of Local Authorities, many of which might have rival interests, such cases might frequently arise, and your Memorialists submit that effective control over the service can only be secured by having the whole of the management in the hands of one governing authority. 8.—The short term of the Licences would not enable the various authorities to set aside anything towards the recoupment of their outlay, even if they were able to pay the working expenses. It appears from the statement made in the House of Commons that only what is considered good and useful, if anything, will be purchased by the Government at the expiration of the licences in 1911, and only at what Government may consider the then value. It is not likely that with these drawbacks many authorities would be prepared to take upon themselves the responsibility of such undertakings. 9 —Considerable time would be occupied by the Authorities in considering the conditions upon which they would be able and willing to accept licences and by the negotiations with the Government and with the outlying Local Authorities in relation thereto. Where licences are granted the various authorities would not have at their command the technical and scientific skill essential to a satisfactory service which the Government have at their disposal. Many serious mistakes would inevitably be made in carrying out the schemes, therebyadding to the expenses of the service and weakening its management and effectiveness, and there would remain the great difficulty of working as one system at the expiration of the licences a vast number of services, built piecemeal, at different times, and by different bodies. 10.—The Local Authorities could not raise money or enter into contracts upon such favourable terms as the Government, nor could they secure such efficient direction for their undertakings. The cost of management would be much greater, and the number of officers and employees would be unnecessarily increased. 11.—Your Memorialists submit that for all practical purposes the Telephone is naturally a branch of the postal service of the country, and that if it be undertaken, managed, and controlled by the same c 18 authority as the Telegraph Service, the two services could be worked together largely to the advantage of each other, and the Government would be able to arrange for increased facilities for communication which are now difficult or impossible. In support of this opinion they desire to draw attention to the fact that the Telephone has largely supplanted the use of the inland telegraph, and to the following figures in further evidence of this competition :— 12.—Whereas in 1889 the net telegraph revenue of the Post Office showed a surplus of £88,000, in 1892 there was a deficiency of ^90,000, and for 1898 this deficiency had increased to £307,000. On the other hand the profits of the amalgamated Telephone Companies have increased to such an extent that whereas for the year ending 30th April, 1890, they were able to pay in dividends and interest £143,000, and show a reserve fund of £53,000, they were able for the year 1898 to pay in dividends and interest ,£294,000, and show a reserve fund of £628,000; and this, notwithstanding the fact that for the year ending 30th April, 1890, the Government received from the Companies £30,000 by way of royalty, which has since increased until for the year ending 31st December last they received no less than £104,000 for this source. Having regard to the foregoing considerations and the declaration of the Government that England is behindhand in the development of the telephone system, "which is vital to the trade and commerce of the country," your Memorialists pray that the Post Office Authorities at once undertake and carry on a National Telephone Service over the whole country, and if this should render it necessary or desirable to acquire existing undertakings your Memorialists are of opinion, in view of the great inconvenience to traders and others which will be caused by the absence of any regular system until the year 1911, that such undertakings should be acquired upon terms to be arrived at by arbitration or other means. A copy of the foregoing memorial was sent to the Corporation and to each of the Local Authorities in London, to all the County Councils and the Borough Corporations in England, and to the London Chamber of Commerce, with a request that if they concurred in the views of the Board on the subject they would address a similar communication to the Government. 19 Several of these bodies expressed their agreement with the memorial. The Bill of the Government is still before Parliament. workmen's A Conference was convened by the Fulham Trams- Vestry to consider this subject, at which the Board were represented by Messrs. Collins and Simpson. The Conference was held on the 21st October, when the following resolutions were passed, viz. •— 1.—"That in the opinion of this Conference the present service of Workmen's Trains into and out of London is entirely inadequate, and that the Railway Companies should be at once urged to make such alteration as would meet the real necessities of the working population of London." 2.—" That in order to meet the wants of a very large number of workmen and workwomen trains should be run later and tickets issued up to 8 a.m. at all stations." 3.—"That the Great Western Railway Company be speciallyurged to run workmen's trains from Westbourne Hark to the Mansion House." 4.—"That workmen ticket holders be allowed to return earlier in the day." 5.—"That the London and North Western Railway Company be requested to run workmen's trains to and from Addison Road and Broad Street." 6.—"That the Railway Companies be asked to give facilities for packets of tickets to be purchased at any time after 4 p.m. from Monday to Friday, and 12 a.m. on Saturdays." 7.—"That the recommendation as to the fares contained in the Cheap Trains Bill, 1898, viz.:— Not exceeding 12 miles return fare 2d. " 16 " " 3d. " 20 ,, „ 4d. be cordially supported by the Conference." Rating of A Conference on the Rating of Ground Ground Values. Values, convened by the Land Law Reform Association, was held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, c 2 20 on the 8th of December, at which representatives o the London County Council and several Municipal Corporations and Vestries and District Boards were present. The Board were represented by Messrs. Wellborne and Gridley, and the following resolutions were passed, viz. :— 1.—"That the present system of Urban Rating is unjust in principle and constitutes a hindrance to municipal progress and social reform; and that in order to give relief to occupiers, and to provide new sources of municipal revenue, it is urgently necessary that ground landlords should contribute to local taxation in proportion to the capital value of their land." 2.—"That it is necessary for this purpose that a separate quinquennial valuation be made of sites, as distinct from buildings, and a rate made and levied so as to fall on the owners of land thus assessed." 3.—"That building land held vacant should bear a fair proportion of rates, having regard to the preservation of open spaces in the interests of public health." The Association requested the Board, if they agreed with the foregoing resolutions, to seal a petition in the form suggested by them. The Board, however, disagreed with the first of the resolutions, and took no further action in the matter. » Trade A. Conference of representatives of Vestries °bsstuction and andDistrict Boards and Metropolitan costermongers. Members of Parliament, convened by the Hackney Vestry, met at the Guildhall on the 8th December, to consider the subject of trade obstructions and costermongers' stalls on highways. This Board was represented by Messrs. Hare and Simpson, and Mr. P. M. Thornton, M.P. for Clapham, was also present. The following resolutions were passed by the Conference, viz. :— "That in the opinion of this Conference, the various Acts of Parliament having reference to trade obstructions on highways in the Metropolis should be amended and consolidated under one Act." 21 "That in the opinion of this Conference, the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, as the Highway and Local Authority, should be the Authority to decide under what conditions costermongers or others causing obstruction should be allowed to stand in any street within their respective districts." A memorial, embodying the foregoing resolutions, was forwarded to the Home Secretary. The appeal against the dismissal by the Costermong-ers. . . . Magistrate of a summons issued against a costermonger for obstructing the public way at Balham High Road, referred to in the last annual report, having been decided in favour of the Board, proceedings were again commenced, but they were stopped in consequence of the Magistrate dismissing some summonses taken out against costermongers by tradesmen in the parish of Battersea. The action of the Magistrate in that case was, however, overruled by the High Court, and the Board are therefore continuing to issue summonses in such cases as appear to them to be necessary.

London J he Board have had under consideration Government jjie Metropolis Management Act Amendment Bill, prepared by Mr. Lough, M.P. ; a draft Bill adopted at a Conference at Westminster of certain Metropolitan Local Authorities; and the London Municipal Corporation's Bill drafted by Sir J. B. Maple, Bart., M.P., L.C.C.; and they appointed Mr. W. Hewett, J.P., and Mr. J. Lidiard to attend a Conference, convened by the Islington Vestry, on the subject. Mr Lough, M.P., attended the Conference and explained the Bill introduced by him into the House of Commons The following resolutions were passed by the Conference, viz.:— 1 —"That in the opinion of this Conference, representing the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, no reform in London government will be satisfactory unless it deals simultaneously with the constitution of the local authorities in all parts of the County of London, and secures an uniform system throughout London." "That the Council should be known as the Mayor and Council of the District of 2.—"That it is desirable that the number of members of the proposed Councils should be less than that of the existing Vestries and District Boards." 3. —" That the transfer to such Councils of the powers, duties, liabilities, and property of all existing subordinate authorities, including overseers and directors of the poor, and the power of making rates, where not already possessed, be approved." 4.—"That the transfer to such Councils of the power of appointing Assessment Committees be approved." 5.—"That officials displaced or superseded should be entitled to compensation." 23 6.—"That the transfer from the existing authorities which at present possess them to the proper ecclesiastical authorities of the power of electing churchwardens, and other ecclesiastical powers, and the disqualification of incumbents and churchwardens as ex-officio members of the Councils to be created, be approved." 7.—"'That it is desirable that the local authorities of the Metropolis should possess the power 'to purchase property compulsorily for all purposes for which they have or may obtain powers to acquire property." 8.—"That it is desirable that the local authorities of the Metropolis should possess the power to raise money under the provisions of the Local Loans Act, 1875." 9.—"That it is desirable that there should be only one and the same sanctioning authority for all loans to be raised by the local authorities of the Metropolis." 10.—"That it is desirable that the local authorities of the Metropolis should possess the power to promote private Bills for purposes peculiar to their districts." 11.—"That with a view to uniformity and signification in the names and objects of the rates to be levied in the Metropolis; the following be approved :— (a) Poor Rate, to meet the precept of the Guardians. (b) Asylums Rate, to meet the precept of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. (c) County Rate, to meet the precept of the County Council. (d) Education Rate, to meet the precept of the School Board. (e) Police Rate, to meet the precept of the Commissioner of Police. (f) District Rate, to defray all other expenses legally incurred by the Local Authority." 12.—"'l'hat it is desirable that all precepts for payment of moneys payable out of the rates should be addressed direct to the authorities in the Metropolis who make and levy the rates." 13.—'• That it is not desirable that the Mayors or Chairmen of the Councils to be created should be ex-officio members of the London County Council." 14.—"That all the Members of the proposed Councils should be elected triennially." 15.—"That the accounts should be audited by Auditors appointed in accordance with the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882." 24 A memorial embodying the views of the Conference was forwarded to the Government. The Conference was attended by representatives of 26 of the 42 Vestries and District Boards, having an area of 37,697 acres, a rateable value of £16,299,412, and a population of 2,421,256. The Conference at Westminster (to which District Boards were not invited) was attended by representatives of 20 Vestries, having an area of 35)93° acres, a rateable value of £20,669,792, and a population of 2,615,157. The Board having been informed that the Government were drafting a Bill for the Local Government of London, presented a memorial praying that in such Bill provision should be made for the incorporation of the five parishes forming this District into one Municipality. The Bill was brought in by Mr. A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, on the 23rd February. The following report upon it was made by the Clerk, viz.:— Clause 1 of this Bill provides for the division of the Administrative County of London (exclusive of the City) into Metropolitan Boroughs. Each of the areas mentioned in the first schedule to the Bill is to be formed into a separate borough, subject to such alteration of area as may be required to give effect to the provisions of the Act and to such adjustment of boundaries as may appear to the Privy Council expedient for simplification or convenience of administration. There are sixteen areas contained in the first schedule, one being the Wandsworth District as at present constituted. Every other borough, unless for special reasons' to be stated in a report to Parliament, must have either a rateable value exceeding .£500,000 or a population of between one and four hundred thousand. The areas of these boroughs will be settled by Commissioners and a Committee of the Privy Council after the Bill is passed. Clause 2 provides that the Council of a Borough shall consist of a Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors. An order in Council is to fix the number of Councillors and the number and boundaries of the Wards. The number of Aldermen and Councillors is not to exceed 72. The clause applies the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, with 25 respect to the Chairman and Aldermen of the County Council to the Mayor and Aldermen of a Metropolitan Borough. The Act in question incorporates certain provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882. The 1888 Act provides that in London the Aldermen shall not be more than one-sixth of the number of Councillors. The Municipal Corporations Act provides that the Aldermen shall be one-third the number of Councillors. From the answer given by Mr. Balfour to a question in the House of Commons it appears that in Metropolitan Boroughs the number of Aldermen is to be one-third of the number of Councillors. The clause provides that the law relating to the constitution, election, and proceedings of administrative Vestries and to the electors and members and auditors thereof, shall apply in the case of the Borough Councils. One-third of the Council will therefore go out of office every year. It does not appear that the Mayor would have the power of appointing a Deputy Mayor, as is the case under the Muni cipal Corporations Act, nor that the provisions of that Act authorising the remuneration of the Mayor apply. Clause 3 provides that the first election of Borough Councillors shall be held on the 1st of November, 1900, or on such later day as may be fixed by the Lord President of the Council. It also provides that the ordinary day of election shall be the 1st of November in each year. Clause 4 provides for the transfer to the Borough Councils of the powers, duties, property, and liabilities of Vestries and District Boards. For raising loans the sanction of the Local Government Board is to be substituted for that of the London County Council. By a scheme to be prepared under the Act the Public Libraries and Baths and Wash-houses Commissioners, and Burial Boards, are to be abolished, and their powers, &c., transferred to the Borough Council. The clause provides that any power relating to some particular parish may be exercised and performed either throughout the borough or in a limited part thereof as may be provided by a scheme under the Act The Public Libraries Acts have been adopted in all the parishes in this District except Tooting, and it might be held that such scheme may extend the provisions of the Libraries Acts to Tooting. In view of sub-section 4 of the clause this is, however,. doubtful. The Bill repeals Section 22 of the Public Libraries Act, 1892, which gave power to 1 )istrict Boards to take steps for the adoption of the Act, with the proviso that where a parish in the district had adopted the Act such parish should be treated as if it were outside the District. Clause 5 provides for the transfer of some comparatively 26 tant duties now discharged by the London County Council, under the provisions of the London Building Act, 1894, to the Borough Councils; also for the transfer to such Councils of the duty of registering dairymen under the Public Health Act, 1891, and of executing the Common Lodging Houses Acts. These duties are set out in Part I of the Second Schedule to the Bill. It also provides for the exercise of certain other powers (set out in Part II of the Second Schedule) by the Borough Councils as well as by the London County Council. The most important of these are powers to acquire land compulsorily (under the Lands Clauses Acts, and after public inquiry and Provisional Order of Local Government Board) and to adopt Part III of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890 (the provision of lodging houses, including cottages). The clause also provides that upon agreement between any Borough Council and the London County Council any powers exercised by the London County Council may be transferred to the Borough Council by a Local Government Board provisional order. Where any such transfer has been made the Local Government Board may on the application of any Borough Council make a like transfer to that Council, and where such transfer has been made to a majority of the Councils an order may be made for a like transfer to all the remaining Councils. Clause 6 is of great importance. It authorises the Privy Council to make a provisional order determining which of the powers under the London Building Act, 1894, or any amending Act, other than the powers mentioned in Part I of the second schedule, are to be exercised by the London County Council and the Borough Councils respectively. The order may also embody such modifications of the Building Act as may appear expedient. Clause 7 provides that the duty of maintaining a main road shall be transferred to the Borough Councils, and that where a highway in a borough is repairable by the London County Council the Borough Council shall, if required by the London County Council, undertake its maintenance in consideration of an annual payment. The clause also transfers to Borough Councils the power of closing a street for repairs, the duty of enforcing bye-laws and regulations with respect to dairies, slaughterhouses, &c. The London County Council will apparently continue to exercise the power of licensing cowhouses and slaughterhouses. The clause authorises the Borough Councils to alienate land, but the Board has this power now without the restrictions proposed to be made. It also gives power to promote and oppose Bills in Parliament. This is, however, subject to the provisions of the Borough Funds Act, 27 1872, which require the consent of the Local Government Board or the Home Secretary, and the consent of owners and ratepayers. The Board already possesses the power of opposing Bills affecting its interests without these limitations. Clause 8 provides that where any power or duties are transferred from the County Council to the Borough Council the County Council shall contribute towards the expense of exercising such powers. Clause 9 enacts that any Committee appointed by a Borough Council for the purpose of the Libraries Acts, or of any of its other powers or duties, may consist partly of persons not members of the Council. This power is at present only possessed with respect to Libraries. The clause also provides that the proceedings of Committees shall not in all cases require the approval of the Council. Clause 10 provides that there shall in future be only one rate, to be called the General Rate, but provision is to be made for protecting the interests of occupiers of premises which are now exempt from any rate or liable to be assessed thereto at a less amount. The accounts relating to the General Rate are to be audited as if it were the Poor Rate. This apparently means the Overseers' accounts only, as auditors of the borough accounts are to be elected (Clause 2), but the point should be made clear. The clause also provides that where a Borough comprises more than one parish the amount to be raised to meet the expenses of the Council is to be divided between the parishes in proportion to their rateable value. This is, however, subject to the proviso that where any local or other Act does not extend to the whole Borough the rate shall be levied as an additional item of the General Rate for the area to which the Act extends. Clause 11 provides that the Borough Council shall appoint Overseers of every parish within the Borough, and shall provide or maintain the office of the Overseers, shall appoint such officers as may be required to assist them, and shall defray the expenses of the performance of their duties. Where there is more than one parish in the Borough the same Overseers are to be appointed Overseers for each of the parishes. The Overseers for the Borough will therefore be one body. The clause also provides for all the rates being levied as far as practicable on one demand note, in a form to be approved by the Local Government Board. The demand note is to state, amongst other things, the approximate amount in the pound required for each purpose. The clause repeals all enactments conferring on any other person the powers or duties of Overseers or any other powers or duties in 28 relation to the making and collection of the Poor Rate. In several parishes in London these powers and duties are, under Local Acts, exercised by the Vestry, and those Vestries will therefore be deprived of such powers and duties in future. Clause 12 relates to the liability of the City of London to the London County Rate, in the matter chiefly of expenses of Assizes and Sessions. Clause 13 provides that where the whole of a Poor Law Union is within one Borough the Assessment Committee is to be appointed by the Borough Council instead of by the Board of Guardians. As the Wandsworth and Clapham Union is not wholly within the Wandsworth District the section would not apply here. Clauses 14 and 15 deal with the appointment of Commissioners to prepare such orders and schemes as may be required to carry the Act into effect. As the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, are applied to the schemes it would appear that petitions may be presented against them by certain local authorities,—as for instance, the Burial Boards in this District,—or by not less than one-twentieth of the owners and ratepayers. The scheme would then require confirmation by Parliament. Clause 16 provides that a parish shall not be situate in more than one Borough. The Privy Council may divide a parish into parts for the purpose of giving effect to the section. Clause 17 provides that every part of a parish which is wholly detached from the principal part of the parish shall be annexed to or divided between any of the Boroughs which it adjoins. This provision affects this District, as there are detached parts of the parishes of Clapham and Streatham. The clause also provides that where a detached part of a parish in the County of London is surrounded by any other County or Counties such detached part of a parish shall be made part of such County. This would affect the small detached part of the parish of Putney which adjoins the River Thames in the parish of Barnes. No provision appears to be made for compensation for a Borough losing detached parts of parishes under the section. The clause also provides that where the County of London surrounds a detached part of a parish in another County the detached part of the parish shall become part of the County of London. This would apparently not affect this District. Clauses 18 and 19 deal with the cases of Woolwich and Penge. Clause 20 provides that any powers or duties of a Vestry which relate to the affairs of the Church, or any interest of a Vestry in any 29 Church property, are not to be transferred to the Borough Council, and Incumbents and Churchwardens are not to be ex-offkio members of the Council. A scheme under the Act is to provide for vesting any such powers and duties in the inhabitants of the parish and for vesting any such interest in the Incumbent and Churchwardens. A Vestry or Town Hall erected on a churchyard is to vest in the Borough Council. This provision should be extended to mortuaries and other buildings vested in any of the bodies whose duties are to be transferred to the Borough Councils. Clause 21 authorises the Privy Council to make orders for giving an appropriate name to each of the Metropolitan Boroughs, to fix the times for the retirement of Aldermen and Councillors, and to nominate persons to perform such duties and to make such other temporary modifications of the provisions of the Act as may be necessary in the case of the first constitution of a Borough Council. Clause 22 applies sections 297 and 298 of the Public Health (London) Act to provisional orders made under the Act. Such orders would therefore have to be made after local public enquiry and would have to be submitted to Parliament. Clause 23 provides for the transfer of officers of existing authorities to Borough Councils and for compensation for loss of office. Clause 24 deals with the appearance of the Borough Councils in legal proceedings. Clause 25 provides, amongst other things, that the Act shall not affect the London (Equalisation of Rates) Act, 1894. Clause 26 provides that the "appointed day" mentioned in the provisions of the Act shall be the day on which the Borough Councils first come into office, or such other day as may be appointed by the Lord President of the Council, and applies sections 85 to 88 of the Local Government Act, 1894 (relating to transitory provisions—continuation of bye-laws, contracts, actions, &c.) Clause 27 contains definitions of terms used in the Act. Clause 28 repeals parts of the Metropolis Management Acts, the Local Government Act, 1888, the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Public Libraries Act, 1892, and the Local Government Act, 1894, set out in the third schedule to the Bill. One of the sections (No. 140) of the Act of 1855 to be repealed empowers the London County Council to place a street which is in more than one parish under the exclusive management of one Authority. This is a useful power and I do not see that anything is put in its place, unless the provisions of Section I of 30 the Bill which relate to the adjustment of boundaries are to apply to such cases. The effect of the Bill is to abolish all the Local Authorities in this District (with the exception of the Poor Law Guardians, the Assess ment Committee, and the Overseers), and to transfer their powers, duties, property, and liabilities to the new Borough Council. Various sections of more than thirty Acts of Parliament are made applicable to different parts of the Bill, and it is therefore not easy to say what is the precise effect of many of its provisions. Its effect will also largely depend upon the nature and extent of the Orders in Council, Provisional Orders, and Schemes which are to be made under the Act. On the 12th April the Board adopted the following Petition to the House of Commons, viz.:— The Humble Petition of the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, under their Common Seal, Sheweth :— 1.—That your Petitioners are the Local Authority, constituted under the Metropolis Management Acts, tor the I )istrict of Wandsworth, which comprises the parishes of Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting Graveney, and Wandsworth, having an area of over fourteen-and-a-half square miles, a population of about 204,000, and a rateable value of ^1,354,172. 2.—By section 90 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, all the duties, powers, and authorities in relation to the paving, lighting, watering, cleansing, or improving of the above-mentioned Parishes, and all other duties, powers, and authorities in any wise relating to the regulation, government, or concerns of such Parishes or of the inhabitants thereof (except such as relate to the affairs of the Church or the relief of the poor) then vested in any Commissioners, Vestry, or other body or officer, ceased to be so vested, and became vested in and are to be performed and exercised by your Petitioners. 3.—That a Bill (hereinafter referred to as " the Bill") has been introduced into your Honourable House, intituled " A Bill to make better provision for Local Government in London." 4.—That your Petitioners are in favour of the division of the Administrative County of London (exclusive of the City of London) into Metropolitan Boroughs and the amalgamation of the duties of all local governing bodies so that such duties may be discharged by one and the same authority in the Borough, and they therefore approve of the principle of the Bill. 31 5.—Your Petitioners observe with satisfaction that their District is included in the first schedule to the Bill as the area of one 01 the proposed Borough Councils, and your Petitioners trust that your Honourable House will retain the District in such schedule. 6.—Your Petitioners are of opinion that the proposed Boroughs should be sufficiently large and important to induce men ot business experience and of high standing in the locality to take part in the Local Government of their District. The District over which your Petitioners exercise jurisdiction is a suitable area for administrative purposes, and it would be to the interest and advantage of the five parishes comprising the District that the said parishes should be incorporated as a Borough Council. 7.-—That although the area of your Petitioners' District is larger than the District of any other local authority in the County of London, the District includes many large commons and open spaces, and it cannot therefore ever become so densely populated as the more central Districts. 8.—That your Petitioners have carried on as one body the local government of the District successfully since January, 1856, the documents and accounts have been kept and the principal business transacted at one central establishment, and any disruption of the system by dividing the District would cause great inconvenience and confusion, and would raise many difficulties without offering any compensating advantage. 9.—That the area, population, and rateable value of the different parishes in the District vary greatly. The area ranges from 566 acres to 2,914 acres, the population from 8,200 to 61,600, and the rateable value from £38,513 to £458,911, and the geographical position of the respective parishes is such that the District cannot conveniently be divided. There are cases in which parts of a parish are more accessible to other parts of the District than to the furthermost parts of the same parish, owing to intervening open spaces and to railway and other means of communication. In many cases parts of a parish have in popular language and for postal and other purposes the same name as, and are practically more closely connected and identified with parishes which they adjoin than with the other part of the same parish, and a part of one parish is situate within the boundary ot another. But the parishes, when united as at present, form a District of suitable size and population for administration by one body. 10.—Your Petitioners humbly suggest the following amendments of certain provisions of the Bill, namely :— 32 x.— That clause i, sub-clause b, should be amended so that every Borough except those scheduled to the Bill should have a rateable value exceeding five hundred thousand pounds and a population of between one and four hundred thousand. 2.-—That in clause 2, sub-clause 2, provision should be made that the Aldermen form one-sixth of the Council and that they shall be elected from the Councillors ; and that the election of Councillors shall be every three years. 3.—That in clause 2, sub-clause 3, provision should be made for the Mayor of every Borough being by virtue of his office a Justice of the Peace for the County in which the Borough is situate, and that no Mayor being a solicitor shall be disqualified from being such justice by reason of his being a solicitor, but any such Mayor being a solicitor shall not practice his profession before the justices of the said County; also that the provisions of section 15 of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, relating to the qualification, term of office, remuneration, precedence, and powers of a Mayor, should be incorporated in the Bill. 4.—That in clause 2, sub-clause 4, a provision should be added disqualifying women from being Councillors. 5.—That clause 5, sub-clause 5, should be amended so that it shall be the duty of the Local Government Board to make the provisional orders therein referred to upon the application of the London County Council. 6.—That sub-clauses 5 and 6 of clauses 7 should be left out of the Bill. Your Petitioners and other Metropolitan Local Authorities have already power, under section 154 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, to dispose of land or property which is not required for their purposes, and sub-clause 5 would confer diminished powers in this respect. For this reason your Petitioners suggest that the abovementioned section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, should not be partially repealed, as proposed in the third schedule to the Bill. Further, your lVtititioners are of opinion that it is not advisable to confer upon Borough Councils the proposed power of promoting Bills in Parliament. Your Petitioners already exercise the power of opposing Bills, and they are of opinion that no further Parliamentary powers are required by the Borough Councils. 7.—That the powers in clause 9 with regard to the appointment of persons not members of the Council as members cf Committees should be restricted to Committees appointed for the purposes of the Libraries' Acts, and that in sub-clause 2 of clause 9 the words " to 33 the extent to which the Council so directs " should be left out, so that under the provisions of the clause the Council should not direct to what extent the acts and proceedings of Committees require approval. 8.—That clause 10, sub-clause 2, should be amended so as to make it clear that the audit of accounts therein referred to extends only to the rate accounts, and that existing enactments referring to the poor rate shall not apply to the general rate with respect to the audit of accounts. 9.—That clause 11 should be amended so as to provide that the Borough Councils shall have all the powers and duties and be subject to all the liabilities of Overseers ; that the office of Overseers should be abolished and their property transferred to the Borough Councils ; and that all references to Overseers in the Bill should be made to refer to the Borough Council. 10.—That clause 13 should be amended so as to provide for the appointment of the Assessment Committee by the Borough Council in all cases, whether the whole of a poor law union is within one borough or not, and that there shall be only one Assessment Committee for the Borough. 11.—Your Petitioners are of opinion that the schemes to be made under clause 15 should provide for repealing or modifying any Act relating to the local government of any part of the Borough, whether it be a public, general, or local Act. 12.—That in cases where, under clause 17, a detached part of a parish is added to some other parish, some equivalent should be given to the parish from which the detached part is taken. 13.—That clause 20, sub-clause 2, should be extended so as to include the transfer to the Borough Councils of mortuary buildings and other property, not being church property, now vested in Churchwardens and Overseers. 14.—That in the second schedule, part I., the powers and duties transferred should include all powers under the London Building Act, 1894, in relation to the appointment and duties of District Surveyors, except as to making Bye-Laws for their guidance. 15.—That the powers of section 20 as well as those of section 28 of the Public Health Act, 1891, should be included in the second schedule, part I. 16.—That in third schedule to the Bill sections 57 and 58 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, should be left out. Your Petitioners are of opinion that these powers, relating to the revocation of resolutions and the appointment of Committees, should remain as at present. D 34 17.—That in the third schedule section 140 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, should be left out. In the opinion of your Petitioners the power contained in such section of placing streets :n more than one parish under the exclusive management of one authority is useful and should remain as at present. 18.—That in the same schedule the reference to part of section 154 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, should be left out. In the opinion of your Petitioners the powers contained therein are more useful than those proposed to be conferred upon the Borough Councils by clause 7, sub-clause 5, of the Bill, and should remain as at present. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Bill may pass into law with the foregoing alterations or such of them as to your Honourable House may seem expedient. Many amendments to the Bill were made in Committee, the chief being a provision that the audit of accounts should be by an auditor appointed by the Local Government Board, the vesting of the powers and duties ot Overseers in the Borough Councils, and the practical settlement of the areas of all the Boroughs instead of this being left (in many cases, as proposed by the Bill) to Commissioners appointed by the Privy Council. Some opposition was offered to the constitution of this District as the area of a Borough on account of its large size, but the inclusion of the District in the schedule to the Bill was carried on a divisicn by a majority of 118 to 58. The schedule, as settled, contains 28 Boroughs, thus reducing the number of local government areas in the Metropolis by 14. Upon the report stage of the Bill the House decided that women might be elected as Councillors or Aldermen. The Bill was introduced into the House of Lords on the 15th June, and read a second time without a division on the 20th June. The Lords inserted a provision disabling women from being Councillors or Aldermen, and made some other amendments. The Bill as amended was agreed to by the House of Commons on the 6th July, and received the Royal assent, July 13th. .35 Metropolis Management Act Amendment(Bye Laws Bill.) This Bill, which was introduced into the HouseofLordsbyLordMoNKSWELL,L.C.C., would empower the London County Council to make bye-laws requiring persons who are about to construct, re-construct, or alter drains in connection with buildings to deposit with the Sanitary Authority plans, sections, and particulars thereof. This Board and other Local Authorities had suggested to the London County Council that legislation was required to obtain plans of proposed drainage works, and the Council inserted in their Sewerage and Drainage Bill of the Session of 1897 a clause empowering them to make bye-laws on the subject. The Board then pointed out to the Council that the clause as drawn would only apply to the drains of new houses, and suggested that its operation should be extended to alterations and reconstruction of drains, which are very numerous. The Council found that the advertised notice of the Bill would not permit of this extension, and they decided to withdraw the clause with the view of the matter being dealt with in another Session. The Board also suggested that the object could be best met by an extension of the existing provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts (which require notice to be given to the Local Authority of intended laying of drains,), so as to provide that the notice shall be accompanied by such plans and particulars as the Local Authority may require. The Council, however, came to the conclusion that it would be more difficult to procure an alteration of the law than to obtain powers to make bye-laws dealing with the matter. They accordingly caused a Bill to be introduced into the House of Lords last Session, but the Bill was not passed. The present Bill is similar to the Bill of last Session. The Board have been in communication with Lord Monkswell on the subject, and the Bill has been slightly amended. It D 2 3fi has passed the House of Lords, and reached the Committee stage in the House of Commons. These four Bills were promoted by the London Water (Purchase of Companies) ;(Finance);Welsh Reservoirs & works); (Aqueducts and works). _ „ .. . . . . r London County Council with the view of obtaining power to acquire the undertakings of the London Water Companies; to provide money for the purchase of such undertakings ; to acquire land and construct reservoirs and other works in Wales; and to construct aqueducts from such reservoirs to London. The Board did not approve of the Bills, as they were of opinion that the water supply should be under the control of a body specially created for the purpose. The London Water (Purchase of Companies) Bill was lost on second reading in the House of Commons, and the three other Bills were thereupon withdrawn. Metropolitan water companies (No.7.). This Bill, which was introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Chaplin, Presi- dent of the Local Government Board, requires the several Metropolitan Water Companies to submit to the Local Government Board schemes for works enabling the Companies to supply each other with water, and whenever in the opinion of the Local Government Board a case of emergency has arisen or is likely to arise, to supply at a reasonable cost such water as may be required for the need of another Metropolitan Water Company. The Board petitioned in favour of the Bill, which passed both Houses and received the Royal assent on the 6th of June. Metropolitan water companies(No.8.). This Bil1 was promoted by the eight Metropolitan Water Companies to provide a scheme for obviating the possibility of a deficiency in time of drought, or by reason of accident, or in case of emergency, by effecting junctions between 37 the respective mains and works of the several Companies, and to authorise the Local Government Board in case of drought or expected drought, or of accident or emergency, to require the taking temporarily of such quantity of water from the River Thames or its tributaries as might be necessary for preventing or remedying a deficient supply of water within the district of any of the Companies. The Board did not approve of the Bill, but no steps were taken by them in the matter, and in view of the introduction by Government of the Metropolis Water Bill, it was withdrawn. metropolis water. This Bill was introduced by Mr. Harry S. Samuel, M.P. It provides that within three months of the passing of the Act the Metropolitan Water Companies shall make such junctions of their mains as may seem to the Local Government Board to be necessary for the effective supply of water by any one Company to another ; and enables the Local Government Board to enquire into the quality, quantity, and pressure of the water, and in case of emergency to require any Metropolitan Water Company to supply water to any other Water Company upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed, or in default of agreement, as the Local Government Board may prescribe. The Board petitioned in favour of the Bill, but the Government having dealt with the question, it was not proceeded with. National Telephone Company sBills These three Bills were promoted by the National Telephone Company, Limited, object of obtaining powers with regard to the opening of roads, &c., which the Company does not at present possess. The Board were of opinion that the Board would be prejudiced by the Bills, and they therefore opposed the Bills. The Telegraph Act, 1892 (Amendment) Bill was not proceeded 38 with, it being held that it should have been introduced as a public Bill. The two other Bills have not yet been read a second time. London, Brighton and south cosat Raiiway This Bill provides amongst other things for widening of the Portsmouth main line between Mitcham Lane and Eardley Road ; the widening of the West End and Crystal Palace line near Cavendish Road ; and the construction of a subway under the railway in lieu of the footbridge from Potter's Lane to Eardley Road. The Board petitioned against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of clauses providing for an increased size of the proposed subway, for its being drained, faced with white glazed bricks, lighted, and paved ; and for the prohibition of advertisement bills or posters therein ; and conditions with regard to the footpath between the subway and the footbridge over the railway between Streatham and Streatham Common Stations; also for the new bridge over Cavendish Road being constructed as a girder bridge, with a clear span of 40-feet, and for the reconstruction of the existing bridge there if required by and at the expense of the Board, and for other provisions. After negociations with the Railway Company the clauses were agreed, and the Board's petition against the Bill was withdrawn. country of London and Brush provincial Electric Lighting company Limited This Bill provided, amongst other things, for the acquisition of property at the Causeway, Wandsworth, the abstraction of water from the River Wandle, and for laying cables across the River Thames under Putney and Wandsworth Bridges. The Bill would also confer power on the Company to lay electric lines, &c., in no less than 15 parishes and districts outside their areas of supply; and would authorise the Company to have one annual statement of accounts in respect of all their 39 undertakings, and relieve them from the obligation they are under to make up a separate account for each undertaking. The Board opposed the Bill, as they were of opinion that the proposed works at the Causeway would be injurious to the public by interfering with the traffic of barges in the Wandle Creek, and they strongly objected to the proposed alteration of the system of accounts, as it would throw difficulties in the way of the purchase by the local authority of the Company's undertaking in this District. The Bill was opposed by several other authorities, and after proceedings lasting over several days it was thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons. crystal Palace Light Railways. This was a proposal, under the Light Railway Act, 1896, to construct a light railway in Croydon, Penge, Camberwell, Lambeth, and Streatham. The scheme comprised (a) The extension of the Croydon Tramway to the Streatham boundary at Hermitage Bridge. (b) A connection between the London County Council's line at Streatham and the London Southern Tramways Company's line at Norwood Road. (c) An extension of the Croydon Tramways from various points to the Crystal Palace. (d) An extension of the London Southern Tramway from the nus in Norwood Road through West Dulwich to the Crystal Palace. The scheme was practically one for the construction of a tramway, whilst the promoters would not be subject to the control of the local authorities and to other liabilities of tramway proprietors. The Board decided to oppose it so far as it affected this District, and forwarded to the Light Railway Commissioners a statement setting out their objections. The promoters eventually decided not to proceed with the scheme. 40 River Wandle Protection. This Bill was promoted by owners of property in the County of Surrey with the view of improving the condition of the River Wandie by conferring powers upon the Surrey County Council to prevent the abstraction of water, the pollution of the river by sewage and otherwise, and the removal of obstructions and nuisances. The Board decided to petition in favour of the Bill ; which, however, was dropped owing to the unwillingness of the Surrey County Council to undertake the duties proposed to be cast upon it. sale of Food and Drugs Bill. This Bill has been introduced into the House of Commons on behalf of the Government by Mr. Long, President of the Board of Agriculture. The Board are endeavouring to secure an amendment of the Bill so as to provide that it should be stated on all tins of condensed milk what amount of dilution would produce a milk equivalent to fresh milk ; and that all tins of condensed skimmed or separated milk should bear a label stating in plain bold letters that the article is skimmed or separated milk, and is not suitable food for infants. The Board also called the attention of the Government to the case of " Derbyshire v. Houliston" in which it was decided that in order to secure the conviction under section 27 of the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, of a person who gives a false warranty it is necessary to prove a guilty knowledge, and as it is generally impossible for the Local Authority to do this, the Board suggested that a provision should be inserted in the Bill amending the kbove-mentioned section of the Act of 1875, by providing that the proof that the warranty was given without a guilty knowledge shall rest with the person who gave it. A deputation consisting of about 100 representatives of Local Authorities in all parts of the country (at which the Board were represented by Dr. Busfield and 41 Mr. Willcox) waited upon Mr. Long, with reference to suggested amendments of the Bill. Dr. Busfield and other members of the deputation spoke on the subject, and Mr. Long stated in reply that he was advised by high authority that condensed separated and condensed skimmed milk did contain useful food properties, and that he was therefore not prepared to promote legislation for the purpose of prohibiting its sale altogether; that he agreed with the deputation that steps should be taken to ensure that persons buying the articles in question should know what they were buying, that with that view section n of the Bill had been inserted in the Bill, and that he would consider the question of amending the section in the direction suggested by the deputation. The Bill is still before the House of Commons. street Noises. This Bill would empower occupiers or lodgers to require itinerant musicians or singers to desist from playing or singing in any public place near their house or premises, under a penalty of forty shillings or imprisonment for a period not exceeding fourteen days. The Board presented a petition in favour of the Bill. It has, however, been found im= possible to make progress with it in the House. The Board decided to take no action with regard to the other Bills above-mentioned. Notification ofcases of in-fectious Disease. The Sanitary Committee reported to the that several cases of infectious disease at the Fountain Hospital, Tooting, were notified to the Board's Medical Officer of Health for Tooting, and that such notices were afterwards withdrawn, the Metropolitan Asylums Board being of opinion that under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Medical Officer of the Asylum 42 is required to notify such cases only to the Medical Officer of Health of the place from which the inmate was brought to the Asylum. It appeared that in the cases in question, a notification respecting the disease from which the patient was certified to be suffering at the time he was brought to the asylum was forwarded in the usual way by the patient's medical attendant to the Medical Officer of Health of the place from which the patient was brought, and that upon some other disease supervening the Medical Officer of the Asylum forwarded, as above stated, to this Board's Medical Officer of Health for Tooting, a notification (afterwards withdrawn) in respect of the latter disease. It is assumed that a similar notification was forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health of the place from which the patient was brought, but the Board were of opinion that in all cases where a disease other than that from which the patient was certified to be suffering when sent to a hospital supervenes, notification thereof should also be sent to the Medical Officer of Health for the District in which the hospital is situate, and they called the attention of the Local Government Board to the matter. The Board were afterwards informed that the point had been noted for consideration in the event of a proposal being made for the amendment of the existing law. unfenced Forecourts. The Board have had under consideration the subject of the danger arising from unfenced forecourts of shops being at a different level to the adjoining public way, and have requested the London County Council to consider the desirability of obtaining Parliamentary powers enabling Local Authorities to require such forecourts to be made level with the adjoining public way. The Council promised that the matter shall receive attention when any proposal for the amendment of the Metropolis 43 ment Acts or of the Building Act is under consideration with the view of application being made to Parliament. school Board Precepts The School Board for London having complained of delay in the payment of their precepts, the Finance Committee reported on the subject as follows :— " The half-yearly precepts of the School Board are usually received " by this Board about two or three months before the commencement " of each half-year, and they are levied to meet the expenditure of the " School Board for the ensuing half-year. This Board include the " amounts of the precepts in the orders which are made upon the Over " seers of the several parishes in the District about one month before " the commencement of the half-year. The precepts of the School " Board require payment of the sums mentioned therein by two equal " instalments, one on the day preceding the commencement of the " half-year and the other on the last day of the first quarter of such " half-year. The Board usually pay these two instalments as follows, " viz., the first instalment two months after the commencement of the " half-year and the second two months afterwards. Both instalments " are therefore paid well within the half-year in respect of which the " sums are raised. The only way in which earlier payment of the " School Board precepts could be made would be for the Board to in" elude in one of their half-yearly calls upon Overseers the estimated " amount of the School Board expenditure for three quarters instead " of two quarters of the year. The Board would then have in hand " at the end of the half-year a sum equal to one-fourth of the School " Board's estimated yearly requirements to meet the first of the two " instalments of the precept for the ensuing half-year, which is payable " in advance. The objection to this course is that the Overseers would " have to raise in the half-year in question three quarters' instead of two " quarters' School Board expenditure. This course would no doubt " meet with strong opposition and resentment, and your Committee do " not think it would be fair to the ratepayers for the half-year in ques" tion. It appears to them that the School Board might themselves " make such arrangements for meeting their expenditure as would be " compatible with the present dates of payment of their precepts by " this Board. It has always been the practice of the Board to do this " with respect to their own expenditure in order to meet the convenience " of the Overseers The first of the calls made upon the Overseers is " payable two months after the commencement of the half-year, but the " Board have made such arrangements that they have in hand at the 44 "commencement of the half-year sufficient funds to meet two months' "expenditure. Your Committee see no reason why a similar course "should not be adopted by the School Board by gradually forming a "fund for the purpose, and they recommend that the Clerk be directed "to write to the School Board in accordance with this report, and to state "that the Board regret that they do not see their way to an earlier "payment of the precepts than at present. Your Committee also "recommend that a copy of this report be sent to the City Corporation "and the Vestries and District Boards, and that those bodies be re"quested, if they concur in the views of the Board in the matter, to "inform the School Board accordingly." The Board adopted the foregoing report; several of the Local Authorities expressed their concurrence in the views of the Board in the matter, and the School Board eventually stated that they would be satisfied if the precepts were promptly paid in accordance with the existing arrangements of the Board. site for Board school, The School Board for London having scheduled a site for a Board School at Magdalen Road, Wandsworth, the Board objected thereto on the ground that being immediately opposite the gates of the Wandsworth Cemetery the constant passing of funerals and the tolling of the bell would interfere with the efficient working of the school, and that the children attending the school would use the cemetery as a playground and be an annoyance to persons attending funerals; and they suggested that a site should be acquired fronting Burntwood Lane, or in one of the roads proposed to be laid out between Magdalen Road and Burntwood Lane. The School Board have now decided to withdraw the proposal. London country council Tramways At the invitation of the London County Council, the Board appointed three representatives (Messrs. Bulcraig, Essex, and James) to confer with a Sub-committee of the Highways Committee of the Council and representatives of the Lambeth Vestry as to the use of mechanical traction on 45 the tramways between Westminster Bridge and Tooting. At the conference it was stated that the Council wished to experiment on the Westminster and Tooting line with various systems of electric traction, and would make a formal application to the Local Authorities for permission to do so; that at present it was intended to try the conduit system in the more crowded thoroughfares, as for instance from Westminster to the Plough, Clapham ; and to try overhead wires on other parts of the route. Shortly after the conference the Council petitioned Parliament for a suspension of Standing Orders, to enable them to introduce a Bill to obtain power to work tramways by electrical power, and for that purpose to erect and maintain on, in, over, or under the surface of streets, such posts, wires, cables, and apparatus, as might be necessary or convenient fcr the working of the tramways, and to make and maintain openings and ways in streets. As this proposal would destroy the veto which the Highway Authorities now have with regard to the use of such systems of traction, the Board and the Lambeth Vestry opposed the application, which was refused by the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Commons. Combined This subject is still receiving the attention Drainage. of Vestries and District Boards. The London County Council at their request introduced a Bill on the subject, but the Board regret that it has been again dropped. In view of the present unsatisfactory state of the law it is hoped that a more successful attempt to deal with the question will be made next Session. Removal of furniture, &c., placed on publicway after ejectments The Board have had under consideration the subject of their powers and duties with reference to the removal of furniture, &c., which has been placed (usually by the police) on the public way in connection with the 4tf ment of tenants from houses, and instructed the several Surveyors not to remove furniture, &c., in such cases in future, and decided to issue a summons against any constable or other persons causing an obstruction by placing furniture, &c., on the public way. The Chief Commissioner of Police was informed of the decision come to by the Board, and was requested to give the necessary instructions to the police to discontinue the practice referred to, but he informed the Board that he could not see his way to comply with the request of the Board. The Board decided to adhere to their decision in the matter, but no case has yet arisen rendering proceedings necessary. Bacteriological The Board have had under consideration Examinations, the proposal of the London County Council to apply to Parliament for power to establish a bacteriological laboratory at which Medical Ofhcrs of Health and medical practitioners in London could obtain, at the public expense, examinations by bacteriologists of material from suspected cases of infectious disease, with the view of aiding the diagnosis, and came to a decision in favour of the proposed powers being conferred upon the Council. As, however, the proposal of the Council could not be carried into effect, even if approved, for some considerable time, the Board have made arrangements for bacteriological examinations to be made by the Jenner Institute during the ensuing twelve months, at the cost of the Board, in such cases of diphtheria and typhoid as may be required by medical practitioners in the District. charge for water for Road Watering purposes, Proceedings taken by the Lambeth Vestry to obtain a reduction in the charge made by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company for water supplied for road watering purposes having been successful, the Board applied to the South- 47 wark and Vauxhall and the Lambeth Companies for a reduction to the charge (6d. per 1,000 gallons) settled in the above-mentioned proceedings. The replies of the Companies not being satisfactory the Board have decided to take the necessary steps to have the question settled by a magistrate. companies'pipes and alterations to public way. The Board having resolved, in June, 1898, to pave West Hill Road, Wandsworth, as a new street, under section 105 of 18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, it was found necessary, in order to form the road and footpaths to a proper level and inclination, to lower the footpath at one place io£ inches. The footpath in question was laid out over thirty years ago, and at the place in question it was apparently made up to a higher level in order to facilitate entrance to the forecourt of a house erected there. A water main was laid under the footpath about thirty years ago by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company. This main was laid so as to follow generally the contour of the footpath, which was made up to a very irregular inclination. The depth of the main below the footpath averaged about 1 foot 7 inches. At the place where the footpath was proposed to be lowered, the minimum depth of the main was 14½ inches. The lowering of the footpath 10½ inches would therefore leave a thickness of only four inches of soil above the top of the main. The old footpath was made up with gravel; the new footpath was to be of tar paving three inches thick. At the place in question the water main was frozen in the severe winter of 1894-5. The Water Company then took up one length of pipe (which had burst) and laid a new pipe in lieu thereof at the same depth. Upon the Company observing the paving works, which were being executed by the Board in June, 1898, the engineer requested the Board, before lowering the footpath, to agree to the Company lowering the 48 water main at the cost of the Board, on the ground that the lowering of the footpath would render the main more likely to be frozen. This the Board declined to do, being of opinion that if the main required lowering the cost should fall upon the Company. The Company thereupon applied for an injunction. Upon the hearing of the application, on the 8th July, 1898, Mr. Justice Kekewich granted an injunction restraining the Board from " lowering the surface of the streets "and footways in their district whereunder the pipes "and mains of the plaintiffs are laid in any manner "which will leave such pipes or mains without a suffi"cient covering of soil or other material to protect them "from injury from frost or otherwise, without first alter"ing the position of the said pipes and mains by "placing them at such depth below the proposed new "surface of such streets or footways as will not expose " them to greater danger from frost or otherwise than "they are at present." The Board appealed. The appeal was heard on the 27th and 28th July, 1898, by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Justice Chitty, and Lord Justice Collins, who, after taking time to consider their judgment, unanimously reversed, on the 8th August, the decision of Mr. Justice Kekewich. The Master of the Rolls stated in his judgment that underlying the Company's contention was the assumption that they were entitled to have a certain amount of soil over their pipes ; he could find no warrant for that assumption, and as the Board were clearly empowered by section 98 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, to remove the soil above the pipes, he saw no ground for saying that the additional power conferred upon the Board of altering the position of the pipes imposed the duty of lowering them in order to protect them from injury. The Company paid nothing for the privilege of laying their pipes down in a public 49 path or road, and they ran the risk of having it made higher or lower by the road authorities under their statutory powers. chairman of the Board. At the first Meeting of the Board after the election of Members in June, 1899, Colonel Arthur Gambier Holland was elected Chairman for the year. A vote of thanks was passed to the retiring Chairman, Mr. William Hewett, for his services during his year of office. e 50 APPORTIONMENTS.

In the Parish of Clapham, 20 lamps burning 5 cubic feet per hour, and 2 burning 10 cubic feet per hour have been added, and 2 burning 5 cubic feet per hour discontinued.

There are 531 lamps in the district of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company, and 92 in the district of the Brentford Gas Company, a total of 623. The charge per lamp per annum formerly by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company was £3 4s. including gas, maintenance, cleaning, lighting, &c.; the burners consumed 5 feet of gas per hour, and the illuminating power was 16 candles. The charge for incandescent lighting is for 4¼-feet per hour (the burner having an illuminating power equal to 79 candles), and with maintenance, cleaning, lighting, &c., amounts to £3 per lamp per annum; to this, however, must be added the cost of 8 mantles per lamp per annum, and the wages of a man attending to same, which increases the cost to a rate equal to £3 11s. 6d. per lamp per annum, or an extra cost of 7s. 6d. per lamp for the increase of the illuminating power from 16 to 79 candles. The Brentford Gas Company's charge for ordinary lamps burning 5 feet per hour, and of 16 candle power was £3 14s. 5d. per lamp per annum, the charge for gas being much higher than that of the Wandsworth and Putney Company; and in this case the total charge for incandescent lighting 96 is £3 12s. 7d. per lamp thus showing a saving of 1s. 10d. per lamp per annum.

V . 2 °v "X \ \ ' APPENDIX B. Sanitary Department REPORT on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the several parishes comprised in the WANDSWORTH DISTRICT DURING THE YEAR 1898 by the DICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH To the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District. Gentlemen, We have the honour to present our Annual Report on the Health, Sanitary Condition, and Vital Statistics of the Wandsworth District, for the year 1898. While the statistics do not show that the health of the district was so good as in 1897, the various rates do not compare unfavourably with those of former years, the year 1897 having been an exceptionally healthy one. The Report also shows that a very large amount of general sanitary work has been carried out, and that the duties devolving on us and the staff under our direction have of late years increased greatly, so much so, in parts of the district, as to severely tax its present capacity. We have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH for the Wandsworth District. REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. Population. The population, estimated to the middle of 1898, was 202,469. The following Table gives the population of the District and Sub.Districts in 1898, and at the three last censuses. Census, 1881. Census, 1891. Census, 1896. Middle of 1898.

Births. The total number registered during the year was 5,096, and consisted of 2,581 males and 2,515 females. The numbers in the various parishes with the birth.rates and the rates of natural increase are shown in the following Table :— TABLE I. IRTHS. RATES. Sub.Districts. Males. Females. Total.

This rate is the lowest of the last ten years with the exception of 1894. The mean rate for the decade was 26 "82, and, as shown in Table 3, there has been a nearly continuously steady fall during that period. The birthrate for the Metropolis was 29.5 per thousand of the population, and was the lowest rate on record. The rate is seen to differ considerably in the sub.districts, the highest being 32 1 in Tooting and the lowest 22.4 in Streatham. The natural increase of the population, or the excess of births over deaths, was 2,241, and the rate of natural increase per thousand was 10.83. The mean of the last ten years was 13.2, and the rate for 1898 was the lowest of the decade. District. 7 Deaths. The total number registered was 2,855, of which 1,456 were males and 1,399 females. This is an increase on the previous year, when the total was 2,602. This includes all the deaths shown in Table VI, in which are to be found 462 deaths of persons not belonging to the District, but which occurred therein, but it does not include the deaths in outlying institutions which should be properly added. They are shown in Table IV., and amounted to 492, and, with this addition and subtraction, we get a corrected total of 2,885. The corrected death.rate was 14.53, and the crude rate was 14.1. The next Table shows the distribution in the sub. districts, and the death.rates, corrected and uncorrected, in each. TABLE II DEATHS. Uncorrected Death.rate. Corrected Death.rate. Sub.Districts.

The rate is, however, seen to be a low one as compared with those of neighbouring parishes, for in Battersea we find it to be 16.9, and in Lambeth 17.9, and in the whole of London it was 18.3. The mortality rate is seen to vary in the sub.districts from 12.1 in Streatham to 18.4 in Tooting.

It is a larger number than in any year of the decade, the nearest approach to it brine: in 1896. The increased number is due to the high mortality from Diphtheria, Measles and Diarrhoea. The death.rate from all these Zymotic diseases was 2.94 per thousand living, as compared with 2.23, in 1897, and was, exceeded in only three years in the decade. The following Table gives the Zymotic death.rate for the last ten years together with those of the sub.districts. It is seen that the rate varied from 2.l in Streatham to 3.59 in Wandsworth.

The Chart on the next page shows the number of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever cases notified in each month of the year. small-pox. There was no death from this cause, and only one case notified, in the sub-district of Wandsworth. No death has occurred since 1895 in this district. There was but one death in the whole of London from Small-pox in 1898. scarlet Fever. The number of cases notified during the year was 703, compared with 1,014 in the previous year. The number of deaths was 15, or 12 below the corrected decennial average. The case mortality was 1-47 per cent. The deaths from Scarlet Fever give a rate per thousand persons living of 0'08, compared with 0'13 for the whole of London. This rate is less than those of most of the London District, and indeed there are only nine districts with rates of smaller value. Observation of the Chart of monthly notifications shows that the fewest number of cases occurred in the month of August, when 30 cases were reported, there having been a fairly continuous fall to that level from the beginning of the year. From August, the number of cases rose rapidly to a maximum of 96 in December. The deaths show that the disease was of an exceedingly mild type, and altogether it had a very slight effect on the total mortality. Diphtheria and These diseases are coupled together, being proMembranous croup bably essentially the same. In contra-distinction from Scarlet Fever we find that not. only had we great prevalence of Diphtheria in 1898, but we had as well great mortality. There were 589 cases 16 Medical Officer of Health Annual Report. notified and there were 88 deaths. The number notified was the greatest we have on record, the nearest approach being in 1897, when there were 576. The number of deaths was 19 above the corrected average, and was exceeded in the years 1893 and 1897 only out of the ten years. The deaths give a rate per thousand living of 0.44, while the rate for the whole of London was 0.39. Of neighbouring districts, we find that Battersea had a rate of 0.70, and Lambeth. 0.38, The mean of the rate for the last ten years was 0.36 per thousand living. Turning to its distribution within the district, we find that there was relatively the greatest amount in Clapham, 186 cases, and next to that Streatham, 180. The mortality was also proportionally greater in Clapham (27 deaths), the next being Wandsworth (27), and Streatham (23). The case mortality was 14.9 per cent., compared with 18.4 in 1897. There has been a great fall in the mortality per hundred cases notified, since notification became compulsory, and this may undoubtedly be in part attributed to the more general use of Diphtheria antitoxin as a remedy. It may also be related to the large proportion now treated in the isolation hospitals, 65 per cent, of the total cases having been removed to hospitals during the year. The distribution in the different months as given in the Chart, shows that the lowest point was reached in August, when there were 28 cases, and that there were two maxima in February and October with 70 and 63 cases respectively. With regard to the prevention of the spread of Diphtheria, the obviously important point is to secure the earliest possible diagnosis, so that isolation may be insisted on, and the infected child prevented from District. 17 ing with others at schools. It is highly probable that a large number of mild cases are missed altogether and so cause outbreaks of the disease. Enteric Fever. There were 125 cases reported and 16 deaths, or 4 below the corrected decennial average. The death-rate per thousand living was 0.07, and that for the Metropolis 0.13. The number of cases was greater than in the two preceding years, but was exceeded in the two years before then. The monthly distribution shows a maximum in December (29 cases), there having been an almost continuous rise from a minimum of 3 cases in March. There was greater prevalence in Clapham and Wandsworth than in the other subdistricts. The death-rate was 12.8 per hundred cases notified. puerperal The number of cases reported was 20, a Fever. decided increase on the last three years. The deaths were 9, or 1 above the corrected average. There has been much doubt and confusion as to what is meant by the term Puerperal Fever, which is not used in the volume on nomenclature of diseases issued by the Royal College of Physicians. Your Board concurred with a suggestion made by the Yestry of St. Marylebone that it is desirable that the words be added : '' Peritonitis, Metritis, in connection with parturition," as well as " Puerperal Pyaemia, Septicaemia and Saproemia." Since then the Royal College of Physicians and the Obstetrical Society of London have expressed the opinion that these diseases are included under the term Puerperal Fever, as used in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Erysipelas. There were 230 notifications, rather less than in the two preceding years, and the deaths were 11, or 2 above the corrected average. Most of those reported were of a trivial character, c 18 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Measles The deaths from Measles numbered 107 and were 27 above the corrected average. This was an epidemic year for this disease, as has been the case in alternate years since 1892. As measured by the deaths, the epidemic was not so great as in 1896 when there were 154 deaths. The death-rate per thousand living was 0'52, compared with 0'68 for the whole of London. The number of deaths from this cause is a serious element in the bill of mortality, and should certainly be much lessened. For the purpose of doing something to prevent its spread, a suggestion was made by the School Board for London, that Measles should be included in the dangerous infectious diseases of the Public Health (London) Act, not to be made notifiable, but to be subject to the provisions as to disinfection, exposure of infected persons or things, etc. This, on being submitted to your Board, was approved by them, but has not yet been carried out. The proper authority to make the order extending these provisions to Measles would be the London County Council, and the confirmation of the Local Government Board is also necessary. At present very little can be done to check these periodic epidemics of Measles. whooping There were 81 deaths from this cause, 11 cough. below the corrected average. This gives a rate per thousand living of 0 0.4 ; that for the whole of London was 0.48. Whooping Cough again is a disease that has been allowed to run its course without much effort being made to check it. The public mind does not at present at all appreciate the necessity for isolation for the good of the community at large, and children suffering from it are commonly to be found in trains., omnibuses, and other places of public resort. District. 19 influenza. There were 7 5 deaths attributed to this cause, or 11 above the corrected average, and the largest number since 1895. There was considerable prevalence of this disease in the first quarter of the year, but of course any estimation of its amount is impossible. It may be noted that the number of deaths from this cause bears a fairly definite relationship to those from diseases of the lungs (other than Phthisis), so that they rise and fall together. Diarrhœa. The number of deaths from this cause was large, 194, and 86 above the corrected average. It is far larger than in any year of this decade, and gives a rate of 0.95 per thousand living. The rate for London was 0.97, and was the highest rate recorded since 1886. The cause was, no doubt, the exceedingly high temperature of August and September and the unusual absence of rainfall.

The above Table gives the deaths from non-zymotic diseases for the last ten years, together with the number above or below the decennial average, corrected for increase of population. Gout and There were 22 deaths, and they were 3 below Rheumatism the corrected average. Cancer and The deaths numbered 159, showing a slight other Tumours. increase on the two preceding years, and an excess of 32 over the corrected average. There is seen to be a steady increase of these deaths during the decade, but it must be remembered that some of the deaths under this heading occurred in institutions and do not belong properly to the district. This is the case more in this group of diseases than in any other excepting Phthisis, owing to the character of the institutions in the district. Tubercular There were 309 deaths in this class, a larger Diseases. number than in any year of the decade, but, allowing for the increase of population, 12 below the average. The deaths from Phthisis were 219, giving, with those in outlying institutions, a rate of 1.13 per thousand living. The London rate was 1.77, and only two London districts had lower Phthisis rates, namely;— Hampstead, 0.74, and Lewisham, 0.88. This is satisfactory, as there is no doubt as to the relationship between Phthisis and general insanitary conditions. Diseases of These deaths also were below the corrected the Nervous system average by 65. The total deaths were 274. Diseases of On the other hand these exceeded the the circulatory avrage by 25.

The next Table, from figures kindly supplied to us by the Clerk to the Guardians, shows the amount of Vaccination performed in the District and constituent Parishes during the year 1897. TABLE XI.

This gives a percentage on the total births of 19.2, which is the highest figure we have had in this district. The corresponding figures of the last 10 years are as follows :— 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 10.0 6.4 6.4 6.8 8.6 11.3 10.8 13.4 13.3 17.6 19.2 24 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. This shows the steady falling oft in the amount of vaccination performed in the district, so that in 1897 nearly one child out of every five born was not protected from Small Pox. This is not so high a proportion as in some London districts, but is a serious risk to the community, as the larger the proportion of unprotected persons in a population the more risk there is of a Small Pox epidemic. The figures for 1898, when they become available, will most probably show a worse state of things, as it is common knowledge that the uncertainty as to the provisions of the recent Vaccination Act caused much indifference to the subject, and unwillingness to put pressure on defaulters. It is, of course, quite too early to form any judgment as to what the effect of the new system of providing gratuitous vaccination will be, but it is earnestly to be hoped that improvement will result, and that the infantile population of London will become more thoroughly vaccinated. Undoubtedly, the great defect of recent legislation, from the point of view of preventing Small Pox, was the absence of any provision for re-vaccination, which would have done much to remove the danger from the comparative neglect of vaccination in early life. sanitary The usual table is given below, showing some operations, details as to work done. More particulars will be found in the local reports in reference to matters not included in the table. On comparing the figures with former years, there is found to be a slight falling off in the number of houses and premises inspected, there being a decrease of 450 on last year. It is also seen that the amount of inspection varies very considerably in the different sub-districts. Thus Streatham, with a population nearly the same as Wandsworth, does less than half the amount of District. 25 tion, and on looking further into details it will be found due to comparative neglect of systematic house-to-house inspection. This is, in our opinion, very unfortunate, as we have always regarded it as a particularly important part of the sanitary work of the district, and we are certain that the system of finding out nuisances and unhealthy conditions, without waiting for people to come and complain of them, has been the great means in the past of bringing this district into so satisfactory a state. It cannot be maintained in such a condition, however, if any relaxation in systematic inspection is allowed. TABLE XIII. Summary of Sanitary Operations in the entire District daring the year 1898.

Estimated in the usual way, the population of Clapham in the middle of 1898 was 48,496, an increase of 692 in the year. Birth and Birth-Rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1,101, of which 527 were males, and 574 were females. This number is smaller than last year by 63, and is less than any year since 1894. It gives a birth-rate of 22.7, also lower than in the last few years. The corresponding rate for the whole of London was 29.5, the lowest London birthrate on record. The natural increment of the population, or excess of births over deaths, was 477, giving a rate per thousand of 9.84. Deaths and Death-Rate. The number of deaths registered in the subdistrict during the year was 624, of which 306 were males, and 318 females. This again is a rise on the last two years. It includes the deaths of 43 persons however, which occurred in institutions in Clapham, they having come from outside the district; but it does not include the 130 deaths of parishioners occurring in outlying institutions. Taking into account these figures, the total mortality becomes 711, and the death-rate 14.66, a slightly higher one than in 1897. The uncorrected death-rate was 12.86.

From 5 to 65 years 39.6 ,, Above 65 years 25.8 „ There were 169 deaths of infants under one year of age, giving an infantile death-rate of 153 per thousand living at that age. This is a much higher rate than has occurred in Clapham for several years. The corresponding rate for the whole of London was 167, and exceeded that recorded in any year since 1871. This high death-rate in the sub-district was not. due to any marked increase of deaths of infants under one year, but was due to the small number of births, this causing the number living at that age to be less. social Position. The proportion in the various social grades was as follows:— Nobility and Gentry 4.9 per cent.

The total number of deaths from Zymotic diseases was 147, a considerable increase on the previous year and almost the same as in 1896. It has been exceeded in the ten years, only in 1893. A notable increase is seen in the deaths from Influenza and Diarrhoea, and to that reference will be made later. The Zymotic death-rate was 3.03 per thousand living. This is not so high as in 1893 and 1896, but exceeds the other years of the decennium. If the deaths from Influenza were excluded the Zymotic deathrate would become 261. The following Table gives the notifications of infectious diseases received under the Public Health (London) Act, and the number removed to hospital, with the number of deaths among those removed and not removed.

Again no case has been notified during the year. There has been no Small Pox in the sub-district since 1895, the one notified in 1896 having ultimately proved not to have been rightly diagnosed. Scarlet Fever The most striking fact as to the Scarlet Fecer of 1898 was its extreme mildness of type. Though 155 cases were notified, there was only one death. It is quite clear that Scarlet Fever has undergone a very great alteration as regards severity in recent years, so much so as to have lost much of its terror. Whether this can be ascribed in any way to increased care given to its isolation, or improved methods of treatment is more than doubtful, but it certainly makes it of less importance to the sanitarian. Of course there can be no certainty that the type may not again change for the worse, so that no relaxation of effort to control its spread is admissible. The change in fatality is illustrated by the fact that in 1890, 5.9 per cent, of those attacked died, and in 1892, the year of greatest prevalence, 4.6 per cent., while last year only 0.6 per cent. of the cases were fatal. There were, last year, 93 37 Parish of Clapham. cases, or 60 per cent, of the whole, removed to hospital. This compares with 71.3 per cent, in the previous year, but is a higher figure than in the three years before that. It should be borne in mind with regard to Scarlet Fever now-a-days that its very mildness makes it more difficult to control, because there must be a higher proportion of cases that are not recognised at all until peeling shows itself, when there will have been ample opportunity of infecting others. Diphtheria. This disease was more prevalent in 1898 than in any year since notification came into force, no less than 186 cases being reported. This was exactly double the number notified in 1897, and was greatly in excess of the number in the previously worst year, 1894, when there were 125. Out of every thousand inhabitants in the district 3.66 were attacked with Diphtheria, while the corresponding rate for the whole of London was 2.63, so there has been an excessive prevalence of the disease in Clapham. The deaths numbered 27, giving a rate of .55 per thousand living. The corresponding rate for London was .39. and those for the adjacent districts of Battersea and Lambeth were .70 and .38 respectively. The deathrate per hundred cases was slightly lower than in the whole of London, the figures being 14.5 in Clapham and 14.8 in London. The number removed to hospital was 126, or 67.7 per cent. of the whole, whilst in the year before, 52.6 per cent. were removed. The percentage mortality of those removed was 15.3, and of those not removed 11.6. The cases were distributed through the year as follows:— January 14. July 13. February 14. August 6. March 10. September 22. April 16. October 32. May 7. November 26. June 9. December 17. 38 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Careful examination of the houses in which the patients lived was made, and in only 26 of them was any serious sanitary defect discovered. It is impossible to doubt that direct infection plays a preponderating part in the spread of Diphtheria, and this has been illustrated in several instances during the year. The spreading by direct infection probably occurs, apart from infecting their own homes, either at schools or in the streets when children are playing together, and in both ways it has evidently spread in Clapham. Thus, from February 15th to March 20th, there occurred 10 cases of Diphtheria among infants attending the Wirtemberg Street Board School, who were in contact with each other at school, being in the same class-room, and playing together in the play ground, but whose homes were in different streets. There resulted from these cases other secondary ones in the infected houses. Probably some child with sore throat of a diphtheritic nature, but unsuspected, had been attending school and so started this epidemic, but it was not possible without examining the throats of all the children in the class room to be certain of this. Another instance occurred in the Haselrigge Road Board School, where at the end of September several boys sitting near each other in a large room, were notified within a few days as suffering from Diphtheria, the homes of some of them not being in the parish. In the months of September and October, and to a less extent in November, there were a considerable number of cases, 45 altogether, notified in Courland Grove, Union Grove and the streets adjacent to them. It was not possible to point to any school or part of a school that appeared to be specially spreading infection, children taken ill having been attending all the elementary schools in the neighbourhood, viz., Gaskell Street and New Road Board Schools, and the St. John's and Christ Church Parochial Schools. The particular district is fairly densely populated, 39 Parish of Clapham. mostly by the artizan and labouring class, but differs not at all in that respect from other parts of the parish that were comparatively free at the time. It is easy to see, however, how in a neighbourhood of this character where many of the children play together in the streets, infection may be spread with facility by personal contact. The long summer drought had caused the sewers to be less well flashed than usual, and there are several "dead end" sewers in the area referred to; those in Courland Grove, for instance, where there were 9 cases, and in Union Grove where there were 6, are so arranged. Special attention was therefore given to the thorough flushing of these sewers, and, where possible, additional ventilating shafts were carried up houses to supplement the surface gratings in the roadways, and some of the latter were done away with. Besides these cases, others not in well defined groups were widely distributed throughout the sub-district, and in no instance was there any evidence that a milk supply was instrumental in spreading the disease. The ages of those notified were as follows:— Under 1 year. From 1 to 5 5 to 10 10 to 15 15 to 25 25 and upwards. 1 65 67 21 16 16 So that 70.9 per cent, of the total cases were between the ages of one and ten years. The point of prime importance in dealing with Diphtheria, and in which there appears to have been some failure, is the early diagnosis of cases, and to that end the bacteriological method now coming into more general use should be most useful. In addition, probably there have been cases, as pointed out above, which have not been recognised at all, a difficulty which could only be dealt with by the more or less systematic examination of the throats of children attending elementary schools. 40 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Enteric Fever. There were 31 cases notified, rather more than in the previous year, and only exceeded in 1893 and 1891 of the last nine years. The number of deaths was 3, the smallest number since 1893. The deaths all occurred in those removed to hospital, 17 in number; 2 of the 17 were afterwards certified not to have been Enteric Eever. In 15 of the houses occupied by the sufferers, sanitary defects of a serious nature were discovered. The monthly distribution was:— January 1. July 1. February 1. August 4. March 2. September 5. April 1. October 1. May 0. November 4. June 5. December 6. Puerperal Fever. There were 4 cases notified, with 3 deaths, showing that only the worst cases were notified. This has probably been partly due to the general doubt that has been felt as to the meaning of the term Puerperal Fever. It is to be hoped that the opinion of the Royal College of Physicians, obtained by the London County Council, will remove the ambiguity as to the meaning that should be attached to the words. Erysipelas. There were 57 cases notified, the same number as in the previous year. There were 5 deaths referred to it. Measles There were 15 deaths from this cause, one less than the previous year. It is probable that there was but a small amount of Measles in 1898. In 1896, there had been 35 deaths, but since then there has been no considerable Measles epidemic. 41 Parish of Clapham. whooping cough. There were 18 deaths referred to this disease, compared with 6 in the previous year. This is a number far below the decennial average. Diarrhœa. As was to he expected from the very hot summer and autumn, there was a large number of deaths caused by Diarrhœa. The number was 55, and is the largest in the decennium; the next largest being in 1897, when it was 47. There were 20 deaths, an increase on the Influenza. There were 20 deaths, an increase on the two previous years, showing that we had more of this disease than since 1895. The deaths were all actually due to lung affections coming on as complications to an attack of Influenza.

Cancer and other Tumours There were 64 deaths under this head, only 2 less than last year. It must be noted, however, that a large proportion of these deaths occurred in institutions, particularly the Home for the Dying, and were not of inhabitants of the sub-district. There were 22 such deaths that ought to be excluded, leaving 42 of the inhabitants proper. Taking this into consideration, however, there is no doubt an increase of deaths referred to Cancer. 44 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Tubercular Diseases. It is satisfactory to note that though the district is becoming more built over year by year, and is therefore more densely populated, the deaths under this head, including Consumption, do not show a tendency to rise. They were 79, and were three below the corrected decennial average. Though Tubercular Diseases are caused by a micro-organism finding entry into the body by the air, food, or drink (especially milk), yet it needs certain conditions of the body, some lowered vital power, to allow it to grow and thrive therein, just as plants will not grow in a soil not suited to them; so that the improvement of the condition of fhe individual as regards general health and resisting power is only second in importance to attempts to destroy, and limit the distribution of, the micro-organism. It is in this way that general sanitary measures prevent the spread of Tubercular Diseases, by lessening overcrowding and providing well drained and healthy houses,free from damp and with an abundant supply of fresh air; and so help to produce a healthy vigorous population. That efforts in this direction are not without success in this sub district, is shown by the fact that the corrected death rate from Phthisis was 1.23 per thousand living. The rate for the whole ol London was 1.77, and in some areas as high as 3.34. Diseases of the Nervous System. Though the deaths were more numerous than in the preceding year, they were five below the decennial average. Diseases of the Circulatory Organs. The deaths were 44 only and 19 below the average. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. This does not include Phthisis. There were 100 deaths, and they were 25 below the corrected average. Diseases of the Digestive System. The deaths numbered 29, and were three below the average. 45 Parish of Clap ham. Diseases of the Urinary System. There were 19 deaths, slightly above the average. Premature birth, Low Vitality, &c. The deaths were 48 and were eight below the average. Old Age. The deaths from old age on the other hand were rather above the average. Violence. 18 deaths were attributed to violenee, being two above the corrected average. Inquests. The number held during the year was 38, and the following were the verdicts:— Males. Females. Total.

Disinfection During year, 404 infected rooms in 336 houses were fumigated with sulphur. In addition, the infected rooms in 10 houses were certified by 46 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. the medical practioners in attendance to have been disinfected to their satisfaction. 319 lots of bedding, &c.,have been disinfected by steam by the contractor, and 1 lot of bedding has been burnt. The difficulty in finding a site for the proposed disinfecting apparatus, has caused the matter to be still in abeyance. Notices to strip and cleanse 340 rooms were served, and 80 rooms were cleansed by the Board's employees. Unsound Food. The following articles were destroyed as being unsound and unfit for human food:— 1 box of skate, 1 barrel of haddock, 1 box of lemon soles, 1 box of tomatoes, 2 kits of fresh herring, 1 kit of haddock. Underground Rooms. Only six were known to be separately occupied in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act. They were regularly inspected. Two other instances of such occupation were found in rooms that did not comply with the requirements, and they were vacated on service of notice. Workshops. The number on the register was 117, and they were regularly inspected. 4 required cleansing, in 3 the water-closets needed to be properly screened, both sexes being employed, 2 additional water-closets were constructed and 17 existing water-closets were repaired, 1 drain was repaired and 1 accumulation of refuse removed. Bakehouses. They were inspected twice during the year and were 47 in number. Lime-whiting was required in 10 instances in May and 13 in October. Cowhouses and Slaughterhouses All were inspected in September, and no objection was made to the renewal of the licenses. Parish of Clapham 47 Smoke Nuisances. In 16 instances warning notices were served, and in one, that of a brewery, a summons was taken out, on which the magistrate made an order to abate the nuisance, with costs, the result being that the offence was not repeated. The complaints of black smoke were more numerous than in previous years, the excuse made being the difficulty of getting steam coal, owing to the Welsh coal strike. Houses Let in Lodgings. No additional houses were registered during the year. Those previously registered were inspected regularly, and much cleansing work had to be ordered. No instances of overcrowding were discovered in them. To discover all cases of overcrowding it would no doubt be necessary to inspect them at night, but this has not hitherto been undertaken, and I think the desirability of it should be considered. Several summonses for breaches of the bye-laws had to be withdrawn, because the landlord let the whole house to a weekly tenant who sub-let to other weekly tenants. Housing of the Working Classes Acts. Proceedings were taken with regard to one house, under these Acts. The magistrate made an order to close part of the house complained of. Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890 and 1891. For the purpose of remission or abatement of thee inhabited house duty, under these Acts, I was able to give the necessary certificates in respect of 54 dwellings. General Nuisances. During the year, 5,630 houses and premises were inspected, including 1,159 house-tohouse inspection, and the total number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 4,369. Of these 3,531 were abated under notice and 838 without; 2,224 notices 48 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. were served, viz.: 1,977 preliminary and 247 statutory. The Table on page 26 gives a statement of nuisances dealt with that can be conveniently classified; in addition, nuisances were dealt with besides those in the Table, and the following were some of the works executed to remedy them:—228 new watercloset apparatuses fixed in place of old ones, 5 additional waterolosets built, 16 watercloset pans disconnected from the drinking water cisterns, 2 closet apartments ventilated, 110 new soil pipes fixed, 20 existing soil pipes repaired, 17 ventilating pipes repaired, 42 leaky water fittings repaired, 19 damp houses remedied, 2 basements ventilated, the walls of 26 houses, ceilings of 15, floors of 61, windows of 21, and steps and chimney of 2 were repaired, 2 cases of water in basement remedied, 61 sinks repaired, 23 baths and lavatories repaired, 18 new sinks, 8 new baths, 6 new lavatory basins fixed, 20 manure receptacles built and 3 repaired, 5 stables repaired, 2 cases of stagnant water, 17 cases of rats, 2 receptacles provided for offal, burning refuse, filthy bedding, 9 cases of animals kept so as to be a nuisance (rabbits 1, pigeons 2, fowls 2, dogs 2, goats 2). In 13 cases new works M ere constructed contrary to the bye-laws. The drains of 130 houses and premises have been re-constructed, 161 inspection chambers have been built, and 205 new ventilating pipes fixed, and of these, 84 new drains, 103 inspection chambers and 101 ventilating pipes were constructed on the initiative of the owners. Police court Proceedeings. In connection with nuisances 13 summonses were taken out, and of these 6 were withdrawn on payment of the costs and 1 adjourned, and in the other six the magistrate made orders for work to be done. The following fines were imposed :—two cases 5s., one case, 10s. 49 Parish of Clapham. For infringements of bye-laws, 33 summonses were taken out, 11 of these were withdrawn, 8 on payment of the costs and 3 without, the work having been done. In 21 cases there were convictions, and one penalty of three pounds was imposed, and six of 10s. with costs. Summonses were issued in two cases for exposing goods for sale on the public highway, and the defendants were each fined 5s. and costs. In addition there were the summonses referred to above under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and for the smoke nuisance. In conclusion I have pleasure in expressing my satisfaction with the way the sanitary inspectors have carried out their work during the year. OLIVER FIELD, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Offiecr of Health for Clapham, E PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. The population of Putney and Roehampton calculated by the usual method, I estimate to be in the year 1898, 21,682. This number will be taken as the basis of calculation for the various tables included in this report. Births and Birth-rates. The total number of births registered in this sub-district was 561, which is equal to a birth-rate of 25.8 per 1,000 per annum. With one exception this is the highest birth-rate we have had during the last ten years, and is 1.4 above the decennial average. Of the children born there were 297 males, and 264 females. Deaths and Deaths-rates. 268 deaths were registered during the year, 140 males 128 females. Four deaths occurred among non-parishioners. In order to get a true estimate of the mortality of this sub-district, it is necessary to add to the number of deaths registered within the parish the number of deaths 51 Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. of parishioners who died in outlying institutions. There cannot be any doubt that greater advantage is taken of hospital accommodation, especially for cases of infectious disease, than in former years, The death-rate, including only the deaths registered within the sub-district, was 12.3 per 1,000 per annum. If we add the number of deaths of parishioners registered outside the district, we have a total of 314, and a death-rate of 14.4. The death-rate was 2 above the decennial average. TABLE I.

This excess was equal to 13.5 per 1,000 per annum, which is 1.3 above the decennial average. e 2 52 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Deaths in Outlying Institutions. 46 Deaths of which I have cognisance occurred amongst parishioners outside the sub-district. 45 of these occurred in outlying institutions, and one occurred in a cab-yard before the patient could be removed to hospital.

Nineteen deaths took place in the Union Infirmary, 20 in general and special hospitals, and six in the Asylums Board Hospitals. 53 Sub-district of Putney and Rooehampton. General Mortality Table III. all deaths registered in the subdistrict have again been tabulated in the usual way according to sex, age and social position. Ages at Death. The proportion of deaths at the various ages was as follows:- Under 1 year 26.8 per cent. From 1 to 5 yeaas 12.3 „ „ From 5 to 65 years 39.9 „ „ From 65 upwards 21 „ „ Infantile Mortality The Infantile Mortality is again low in comparison with former years. For every 1,000 births, 128 infants died under the age of twelve months. The infantile mortality in London during 1898 was 167 per 1000 births, and was the highest recorded since 1671. This improvement in the infantile mortality is satisfactory to record, inasmuch as it indicates increased care both in the nursing and feeding of infants. Social Position The proportion of deaths classified according to social position was as follows:— Nobility and Gentry 3.7 per cent.

Fifty-six deaths were registered from these diseases compared with 38 in the previous year. The difference is accounted for by the increased mortality arising from Influenza, Measles and Whooping Cough. The Zymotic death-rate was 2.5 per 1,000 per annum, and was considerably above the decennial average. If the six deaths which occurred in outlying institutions be added to those registered within the sub-district, it gives us a total Zymotic death-rate of 2.8. 56 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. During the year 86 certificates were received by me, of cases of infectious diseases notifiable under the Act. During 1897, 139 Notifications were received. „ 1896, 164 „ „ „ This shows an undoubted improvement in regard to the presence of dangerous infectious diseases.

Diphtheria. During the year Diphtheria was very much less prevalent in the parish than during the last two years. The epidemic which prevailed during the last three months of 1896 and during January, 1897, soon died down, and the disease has been becoming gradually less prevalent ever since. There were only 20 cases notified to me, and of these, 12 were removed to hospital. This compares very favourably with the two former years when 49 and 46 cases were notified. Six cases ended fatally. This is equivalent to a percentage mortality of 30. The death-rate from Diphtheria per thousand living of the population was .27. This figure compares favourably with the death-rate from the whole of London, which was .39 per 1,000. One case was notified under the head of Membranous Croup, and it resulted fatally. Typhoid Fever. Seven cases of this disease were notified through the year, witli two cases of death. Measles and Whooping Cough. Twenty-nine cases of death resulted from these two diseases, which is equal to a tality of 1*3 per 1,000 of the population This is the highest mortality during the last ten years, with the exception of 1896, and is slightly in excess of that of the whole of London. A very violent epidemic of measles raged during the months of April and May, Unfortunately the existence of these diseases in epidemic form may not become known to me for some time after the outbreak on account of them not being notifiable diseases under the Act. It seems to me that much more could be done if the Medical Officers of Health were made aware of the existence of these diseases Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. 61 before they had assumed epidemic proportions. By at once preventing children coming from infected houses, or who have been especially exposed to the contagion, from attending school, the extension of the disease I think could be limited. Even during the existence of these diseases, if the serious nature of them could be impressed upon the people, and, therefore, the greater necessity for care being taken, I feel sure the mortality would be much lessened. Small Pox. No case of this disease was notified. Puerperal Fever. No case of this disease was notified. Influenza This disease was again epidemic during the early months of the year. Death was certified to be the result of it in ten cases. This mortality is as severe as we have had during any year with the exception of 1895. Diarrhoea. Eleven deaths resulted from this disease. The decennial average is 7.4. The death-rate for the year from Diarrhoea was equal to .5 per 1,000. For the whole of London the death-rate was .97 per 1,000. Deaths from Non-Zymotic Diseases. 212 deaths from Non-Zymotic diseases were notified. Cancer and other Tumours For some years there appears to have been a gradually increasing mortality from Cancer. During 1898, 13 deaths were registered as occurring from Cancer and other tumours, a decrease of five on the number registered in 1897, which was the highest we have ever had in this district. 62 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Phthisis and other Tubercular Diseases. I regret to record an increase in these diseases especially as there had been a progressive decrease during the last ten years. The valence of these diseases in one way are a test of the sanitary conditions of a locality. Fresh air, dry soil, sufficient cubic space and clean rooms are the conditions which prove inimical to the extension of Tubercular Diseases, especially Phthisis, which is thus practically within our own control. The food supply of the people is also a recognised factor in the spread of Tubercle, and this especially applies to milk. A wide-spread effort is now being made throughout the country to stamp out the disease as far as may be, especially in so far as it is produced by the milk supply of children. It is admitted that not unfrequently, cows suffering from Tubercular Disease of the udders are used as milch cows, and the milk from such cows swarms with Tubercular Bacilli. Parliamentary powers are being asked to make it a penal offence to supply milk from this source, and there is a probability that such powers will be obtained. We propose having a Bacteriological Examination made of samples of milk taken in this district in order to give us an idea as to what extent the milk supply is contaminated with the Tubercular Bacillus. Non-Zymotic Diseases were the cause of 200 deaths. Sub-district of Putney and Roehnmpton. 63 TABLE VII. COMPARATIVE TABLE OF NON-ZYMOTIC MORTALITY.

The decennnial average was 28.7. Circulatory Diseases. I stated in my last year's report that the deaths from these diseases had been on the increase for the last tew years. During 1898, however, there has been a great drop in the number registered under this heading; only 19 were registered instead of 33. The decennial average was 207. Inquests. Males. Females.

Eight of these inquests concerned the deaths of infants who were suffocated accidentally while in bed. This either reveals gross carelessness or intoxication on the part of their parents. The number is very much in excess of what we have been accustomed to have in this parish. Scarlet Fever Return Cases. There were apparently one or two cases during the year, but on closer examination of the facts, I came to the conclusion that the second cases from the same house were not the result of the return of cases from hospital but were infected in other ways. Sanitary Work. A large amount of useful sanitary work has been carried on throughout the year. A Table of the sanitary operations will be found in the combined Report of the District. There has been a great increase in the number of premises inspected. 3,625 houses were inspected, compared with 2,896 during the previous year. All notices were complied with after the first or second notice, with the exception of two cases investigated by the magistrate. 59 rooms were disinfected after the usual Sub-district of Putney and Roehampton. 65 manner, and no cases of infectious diseases occurred after disinfection had been carried out. Overcrowding was abated in 4 eases. Rooms, staircases and passages, were cleansed and repaired in 45 cases. 4 Cesspools were abolished. 34 Yards drained or paved and cleansed. The unclassified nuisances abated were as follows:— 10 Soil and ventilating pipe joints re-caulked. 2 Rotten wood flooring repaired. 4 Leaky water pipes (to prevent soakage of walls). 4 New water closets provided. 5 Keeping animals so as to be a nuisance. The insanitary and dilapidated property called Seymour Row has now, I understand, come into the hands of the freeholder, and arrangements are in hand for building better houses on the site. In the process of disinfection, the following amounts of the various substances have been used:— 24 gallons of carbolic acid containing 95 per cent. of tar acid. 34 cwts. of carbolic powder containing 15 per cent. of carbolic acid. 1 cwt, of roll sulphur. All the Bakehouses have been frequently inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. The necessary cleansing and limewashing has been done twice during the year. All Workshops have been inspected and found satisfactory. The fishmongers shops have been frequently inspected and the offal has been removed in accordance with the bye-laws. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses have been inspected, and I have found no reason for objecting to the renewal of their licenses, f 66 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. In connection with this subject the more efficient inspection of the physical condition of Milch Cows will presently engage the attention of the legislature, and I trust that means will be taken whereby all diseased animals may be either destroyed or removed. The inspection of meat in slaughter-houses is another kindred question. There is no doubt that the opinion of Sanitarians is becoming increasingly favourable to the slaughter of cattle in public abattoirs. The inspection of diseased meat can only thereby be efficiently carried out. Houses let in Lodginegs. These bye-laws have not yet been put in force in this sub-district. I mentioned my objections to their application in this parish in my last report. My opinion still remains the same as expressed in that report. In reviewing generally the sanitary work of the year, I cannot doubt that a great deal of useful and necessary work has been accomplished. The house to house visitation has been maintained more vigorously than ever. All notices have been complied with readily with one or two exceptions. No epidemic of any serious proportions has visited us, with the exeeption of Measles and Whooping Cough, which are non-notifiable diseases, and are, therefore, not so directly under control. All operations have been carried out in a zealous and harmonious manner by the various officers of the Board. To the Sanitary Committee as well as the various officers concerned, I have pleasure in tendering my thanks for the support and assistance I have received in the performance of the duties of my office.

Population The estimated population of Streatham, for the middle of the year 1898, is 60,459, and upon this estimate are based the various rates of mortality, &c; having regard, however, to the extensive building operations during the year, this is probably considerably below the actual figure. Births and Birth-rate. There were 1,359 births registered during the year, 669 of males and 690 of females. This is the highest number ever recorded in the sub-district, and produces a birth-rate of 22.4 per 1,000. Deaths and Death-rate. The deaths registered during the year numbered 708; of these, 379 were of males and 329 of females, producing an uncorrected death-rate of 11.7 per 1,000 persons living. The corrected death-rate, obtained by excluding the ' number of deaths of non-parishioners occurring within the sub-district (73) and including those of parishioners dying within the Metropolis, but outside the Streatham area (101) and producing a total of 735, is equal to 12.1 per 1,000 of the population. f 2 68 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Natural increase. The excess of births over deaths numbered 651—of males 290, and of females 361; ducing a rate of natural increase equal to 10.7 per 1,000 of the population.

The deaths in outlying Metropolitan Institutions numbered 101, compared with 106 during the year 1897. Of the deaths recorded, 51 were of males and 50 of females. Parish of Streatham. 69 Diphtheria was again the largest contributor to deaths from Zymotic Diseases. 23 of the deaths occurred in the Institutions of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union, 52 in general and special hospitals (including lunatic asylums), 24 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and 2 elsewhere. Six Coroner's inquests were held in connection with deaths in outlying institutions with the following verdicts:— Violence:— Accidental Causes. .Injury from Fall (male). Burns (female). Scalds (male). Run over (male). Injury from Fall (male). Hœmorrhage during Childbirth (female).

This excess is due to Measles and Whooping Cough, both being diseases which are not governed by the notification clauses of the Public Health (London) Act 1891. The percentage of deaths from Zymotic diseases upon the mortality from all causes was 14-5, compared with 14r8 during the year 1897. Table B.

Small Pox. No case of this disease occurred during the year under report. Measles. The mortality from this disease was much higher than during the preceding vear, 28 deaths being recorded, 26 at home and two in hospital. It will, however, be remembered that during 1897 the mortality was remarkably low. Measles not being a disease notifiable under sec. 54 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the mortality is the only means of judging as to the prevalence of the disease. This disease was one of the principal contributors to the total deaths from Zymotic diseases. Scarlet Fever. This disease was less prevalent during the year under report than in the previous year. The cases coming under notice numbering 187 compared with 215 during the year 1897. Those removed to isolated hospitals numbered 123, of which 5 proved fatal. This, however, is a very low proportion indicating a mild type of the disease. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. These diseases were slightly more prevalent than in the preceding year, 182 cases occurring compared with 164 during the preceding year. The mortality was, however, lower, 23 deaths being recorded (6 at home and 17 at hospital), compared with 26 during 1897. Hospital isolation was provided in 126 instances. Typhoid Fever. During the last few years the prevalence of this disease has been decreasing, as the following will indicate:—1898, 29; 1897, 26; 1896, 27; 1895, 36. A slight increase, however, occurred during the year under report. Fourteen of the cases were removed to hospital. Five deaths were recorded during the year from this disease. Parish of Streatham 77 Whooping Cough. From this disease 20 deaths were recorded (19 at home and 1 at hospital), compared with 10 and 35 during the two preceding years respectively. This disease and Measles added largely to the Zymotic deaths. Diarrhoea. From Diarrhœa 29 deaths were recorded, comparing very favourably with 38 during the preceding year. As usual most of the deaths occurred during the third quarter, being a disease largely attributable to hot weather. Influenza. During the year 16 deaths was recorded as being directlv attributable to this disease. A much larger number, however, occurred with respiratory and other complications more particularly in St. Anne Home, which is an institution for the aged poor of St. Pancras. The following Table gives the number of cases of infectious disease notified, removed to hospital, and the mortality therefrom both in the hospitals and at home. TABLE VI. DISEASES.

In the Constitutional class, including Tubercular diseases, a slight increase is shown, and a very large increase in the Respiratory class. The latter, as referred to in a previous paragraph, being largely associated with Influenza. It is to this class that the higher general deathrate is due. Parish of Streatham. 79 Ages at Death, The number of deaths under one year of age was 163; under five, 232, and under twenty- five, 287. Senile Decay. From old age, 56 deaths were recorded, being equal to 7.9 ner cent. of the deaths registered from all causes. Of these 24 were of males and 32 of females. At ages of 65 years and upwards, 230 deaths were recorded. A tabulated statement is here set out showing deaths at high ages. They were equal to 24.8 per cent. of deaths at all ages. TABLE VIII. Age.

Thirty-eight deaths were submitted to the Coroner, and in 2S instances he deemed inquests necessary, and the following are the verdicts of the respective juries:— 80 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Natural Causes 10 Violence:— Accidental On Railway 1 Poisoning 1 Suffocation 3 Injuries 5—10 Suicide Hanging 1 Cut Throat 2 Gun-shot 1— 4 Open Verdicts Poisoning 1 Injuries 2 Alcoholism 1— 4 Total 28 Sanitary Operations. A tabulated statement of the Sanitary operations which will repay perusal will be set out in table No. XIII. of the combined Report. During the year, 1,238 inspections of premises were made by the staff of my department. These inspections were principally necessitated by complaints and cases of infectious disease, house-to-house inspection being practically extinct. I again take the opportunity of urging the necessity of an addition to the present inadequate staff of Sanitary inspectors, in order that this very important section of Public Health work may be operated, with a view to the discovery of sanitary defects, which at present are only brought to notice after an outbreak of infectious disease, or upon the nuisance becoming so serious as to render it absolutely necessary on the part of the occupier to make complaint at the office. Public Health duties are obviously intended to be of a preventive character, and I am strongly of opinion that at least that class of property coming within the definition of the bye-laws relative to houses let in lodgings should be subject to annual inspection. As a result of the inspections carried out by the Parish of Streatham. 81 staff it was found necessary to serve 1,333 intimations, and it is a subject of no little satisfaction to note that in only 35 instances was it necessary to serve second notices in order to obtain compliance with necessary sanitary requirements. The large amount of time occupied by the supervision of drainage work may be gathered from the fact that 10,844 inspections were made for the purpose, the test being applied on 4,422 occasions. Disinfection by sulphurous acid gas was carried out to 370 rooms in 302 houses after infectious disease, and in 338 instances the bedding, &c., was submitted to superheated steam. Amongst other sanitary operations 451 rooms were cleansed or repaired, 106 sinks and 166 rain-water pipes disconnected from drains, 139 water-closets cleansed or repaired, 87 dustbins provided, 27 yards drained and paved, 85 water-closets supplied with water, and 67 spyhon traps fixed to drains. Bakehouses. The bakehouses, now 44 in number were twice inspected daring the year, and the necessary requirements found to have been attended to. Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses. These have been kept under close observation during the year, and subjected to my usual annual inspection. Several small defects being remedied where necessary. Mews, Stables, &c. Stables were required to be paved and drained in three instances. Public Mortuary. During the year 28 bodies were received at the public mortuary. G 82 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Police Court Proceedings. Under the various sections of the Public Health (London) Act it was found necessary during the year to issue 19 summonses, and in each instance the required magisterial orders were made. Of the summonses issued, 9 were in respect of contravention of the bye-law relative to giving notice to the Sanitary Authority before commencing work in connection with water-closets, &c., fines being inflicted in each case; two were in regard to improper cisterns; three were to enforce the completion of sanitary works already in progress, and two to remedy defective drains; one summons was also served to abate a nuisance arising from the improper keeping of animals. In support of most of these summonses I have personally attended the police court. Under the smoke nuisance clauses of the Act two summonses were served, one against the L. B. and S. C. Railway, and another against the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, for nuisances arising from the issue of black smoke. During the year, by direction of the Local Committee, the work in connection with the steam disinfection of infected articles has been transferred from the former contractor and carried out at the Board's disinfecting station at Wandsworth. I am, however, unable to report that this is so satisfactory as the former arrangement. In conclusion, I have to record my satisfaction at the manner in which the staff have carried out their duties.

The estimated mean population of 1898, is 7,915, having regard, however, to the ingly large amount of building now being carried out, this is probably far below the actual figure. Births & Birth Rate. The births registered during the year numbered 251, of which 123 were males and 131 females. This is by far the largest number of births registered in the sub-district since its separate existence as a sanitary district. The birth-rate is equal to 32.1 per 1,090 of the population. Deaths & Death Rate. During the year under report, 294 deaths were registered in the sub-district. Of these, 159 were males and 135 females. Considering the large number of non-parishioners dying in the sub-district, an uncorrected death-rate is absolutely valueless. G 2 84 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Of the 294 deaths registered, 120 only were of parishioners, as the following table indicates:— TABLE I. Parishioners NonParishioners Totals Deaths in Local Public Institutions 2 172 174 Deaths in Tooting, other than in Local Public institutions 118 2 120 Totals 120 174 294 To produce the corrected death-rate, the number of deaths of parishioners occurring in outlying public institutions must be added (26), producing a total of 146, and a rate of 18.4 per 1,000 of the population.

H 2 100 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Zymotic Diseases. During the year 1898, 194 deaths, 110 of males and 84 of females, occurred from diseases of a zymotic nature, an increase of 66 compared with the year 1897, and 41.9 above the corrected decennial average. This increase is wholly due to the greater number of deaths from Measles, Whooping-cough and Diarrhoea, as compared with last year. The most noticeable increase is, however, in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, 83 deaths having been registered as occurring from this, an increase of 45 compared with last year, and of 43 1 compared with the corrected decennial average. The number of deaths which occurred from the notifiable diseases, viz.: from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Puerperal Fever, and Erysipelas was 27, compared with 46 in 1897, 20 in 1896, and 19 in 1895. Table IV. shows the number of deaths from the seven principal epidemic diseases, the total deaths from all zymotic diseases, the zymotic death-rate per 1,000, the total deaths from all causes, and the percentage of deaths from all zymotic diseases to deaths from all causes for the year, as well as for the 10 preceding years, and also the number above or below the decennial average corrected for increase of population.

The zymotic death-rate was 3*03 per 1,000 of population, an increase of 1-03 compared with 1897, and -49 above the decennial average. '1 o ascertain the true zymotic death-rate for the year, the deaths from these diseases in outlying institutions must be added, and those in internal institutions not belonging to this parish subtracted. 102 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Eleven deaths from zymotic diseases occurred in the Union infirmary (one from Enteric Fever, eight from Measles, one from Whooping Cough and one from Diarrhœa), and 25 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board (one from Influenza, seven from Scarlet fever, 13 from Diphtheria, one from Enteric Fever, and three from Measles), a total of 36. One death from Whooping Cough occurred in one of the internal institutions. The total number of deaths from zymotic diseases thus becomes 229, compared with 161 in 1897, and 218 in 1896. The corrected zymotic death-rate was 3.81 per 1,000, compared with 2.8 in 1897, 3.96 in 1896, 2 03 in 1895, and 2.64 in 1894. In the Metropolis for the year 1S97 the zymotic deathrate was, exclusive of Influenza, 2.77 per 1,000, while in this parish the same rate was 3.39 per 1,000. There was again no death from this disease Small Pox. during the year. One case was notified, but not removed to hospital. The patient was a girl, who had within the period of incubation come from near Leicester to visit friends in the parish. Careful inquiries both here and at her home failed to discover the cause of infection, no case of Smallpox having occurred in the neighbourhood of her home for some years, and there had been no case notified in the Metropolis for some time. The official return of the vaccination officer for the year 1897 shows that of 1,830 births registered, 1,432 or 78.2 per cent. had been successfully vaccinated, four were certified as being insusceptible of vaccination, 176 died unvaccinated, 43 were postponed, 21 had removed 103 Parish of Wandsworth. to districts the vaccination officer of which had been duly apprised, 94 had removed to places unknown, 48 remained on the hooks as unvaccinated, while in respect of 12 certificates of conscientious objection had been received. The percentages of unvaccinated during the year is slightly less than in the two preceding years, viz. 12.13 compared with 15.8 and 13.4. It will be interesting to compare the 1897 return, in which the conscientious objector first appears, with the return for 1898. During the year 277 cases of Scarlet fever Scarlet Fever. were notified, a large decrease compared with the year previous, when 501 cases were notified. This number would have been less had it not been for an outbreak of this disease in the Royal Patriotic Asylum in the month of December. Of the total number of cases notified from the above institution, viz. 117,48 were received during December, and the rest in January, 1899. Of these 277 cases, 143 or 51.6 per cent. were removed to the Asylum Board hospitals, where seven died, and 134 or 48 4 per cent. remained at home, with only one death. The total case mortality was 28.8 per cent. compared with 2.39 per cent. in 1897, 3.75 per cent. in 1896, 1.63 per cent. in 1895, and 2.25 per cent. in 1894. The mortality of the cases treated at home was only .75 per cent., while of the hospital treated cases the mortality was uearly 4.9 per cent. or more than six times higher. Of the seven deaths, only two were registered as being due to Scarlet Eever alone, three to post Scarlatinal Diphtheria, and two to Meningitis following Scarlet Fever. 104 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. One of the deaths was of a child that had been removed from Battersea parish, the parents having, while the child was in hospital, removed to this parish. The case mortality for the whole of London was 3.43 per cent. The greatest number of notifications was received in December, viz. 59, 48 of These being from the Patriotic Asylum, and the fewest, viz. 11 in October. The proportion of notified cases per 1,000 of population was in this parish 4.6 per 1,000, while for the whole of London this rate was 3.7 per 1,000. No difficulty was this year experienced in having cases of Scarlet Fever removed to hospital. The death-rate per 1,000 from Scarlet Fever for the year was T3, compared with T9 in 1897, and .25 in 1896. For the Metropolis this death-rate was also .13. The only point of special note with reference to Scarlet Fever during 1898, was the outbreak in the months of November and December in the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum. In the outbreak 117 cases occurred, and the incidence of these was as follows:— 1st case notified Nov. 19. 1st symptoms 17 Nov. Removed to Hospital Nov. 18 2nd „ „ 19 „ 18 „ „ „ 18 3rd „ „ 19 „ 18 „ „ ,, 18 4th „ „ 21 „ 20 „ „ „ 20 These cases occurred respectively in dormitories Nos. 3, 9, 11 and 12. The dormitories were disinfected on November 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th. 105 Pariah of Wandsworth. The fifth case was notified on November 28th and. was removed to hospital, and the sixth case on December 28th. On the 30th December I was informed by the Medical Officer of the institution that 42 children showed signs of desquamation, particularly on the feet, and a few also on the hands. I visited the institution, saw the children, and came to the conclusion that these also had suffered from Scarlet Fever, having been infected at the same time as the first four cases in November. Since December 30th, 1898, other 09 cases have been notified, all these with the exception of seven being also cases infected about the 21st November. The other seven cases are secondary and were infected directly from some of the cases desquamating. The distribution in dormitories was as follows:— No. of dormitory 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 No. of cases — 3 4 4 3 — 6 23 25 7 21 21=117 The age distribution given in the following table shows that children under 12 suffered most, 103 out of 151 having been attacked, while over 12, only 14 cases occurred out of 128:— Ages 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Cases 9 13 20 28 19 14 3 4 6 1=117 Age distrib. in School 10 13 26 36 29 37 41 41 33 15 I have made careful inquiry into the causation of the outbreak, but have not been able to definitely say what was the immediate cause, whether infected from outside or by means of the milk supply. The first source of infection, viz.:—from outside, is the least probable, as no communication with visitors had taken place since the 5th November, while the first symptoms of the 1st case appeared on the 17th, the usual period of 106 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. incubation being four to six days. According to the statement of the Lady Superintendent, no books, letters, or clothing had been received from outside by any of the first infected ehildren. Inquiry was also made with reference to new arrivals in the Institution, but no infection could be traced to that source. One girl made a statement that fever had been present in the neighbourhood of her home, and that some girls from the school which she had been attending had suffered, but on communicating with the Medical Officer of Health for the district, I was informed that the fever then prevalent was Enteric Fever and that no case of Scarlet Fever had been notified to him for two years. My attention was then directed to the milk supply, and I was informed that all the milk, viz.:—about 80 quarts per day, was obtained from one company, and that this had been brought to the Institution by one man for some years. This man had been ill for three days, viz.:—the 15th, 16th and 17th November, but it was found that he had been suffering from an ordinary cold. The manager of the branch had delivered the milk on the three days above-mentioned. Inquiry was made as to the health of these employees, but no history of illness of any kind could be obtained. The milk on being received at the Institution is poured into large tin pails, and these are at once placed in a steam chamber, and subjected to a temperature of about l80° F. for 20 minutes. No milk is drank by any of the inmates until after this process has been completed. When removed from the chamber it is poured by one of the maids into a large tin jug and poured from it into the mugs of the girls at table. All the maids and attendants who have to deal with the steaming and 107 Parish of Wandsworth. distributing of the milk to the girls were and had been for sometime in good health. I communicated with the Company supplying the milk, and asked them to let me have a list of the farms from which the milk supply to the Patriotic School had been obtained from the 6th to the 16th of November. I received from the managing director a list of 12 farms from which milk had been received by them, and I at once communicated with the Medical Officers of Health for the different districts. From all. with one exception I have received replies, and only in one district had there been any case of Scarlet fever for some months, except in one instance, and the Medical Officer of Health replied as follows;— January 13 th, 1899. Dear Sir, In answer to your letter I beg to inform you there bas been an outbreak of Scarlatina in this town. The first cases were reported to me the 26th of September and there are still cases in the town. I have not had any reported from the farm you mention but there may have been cases among the employees. I will make enquiries and report to you as soon as possible. January 15th, 1899. Dear Sir, Yesterday I visited the premises you mentioned and made careful enquiries. There has been no case of Scarlatina on or near these premises, nor as far as I could ascertain among any of the employees. I obtained the names of all the workmen, and if there had been a case of Scarlatina in any of their households I should have been informed of it under the Notification Act. After a careful consideration of the whole circumstances of the outbreak I have come to the conclusion that it was due to contamination of milk by the specific germ of the disease and this for two reasons— 108 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. (1) That of 117 cases, 110 must have been infected on or about the same day, and (2) that the outbreak has been an exceptionally mild one, so far no death having been reported, this being quite a characteristic feature of epidemics of Scarlet Fever caused by contamination of milk supply. I attribute the fact of the exceptional mildness of the outbreak also to the partial sterilization of the milk before use. The best authorities agree that it requires an hour's (some say many hours) exposure of milk to a temperature of 212° F. to completely sterilise it, and in this case the exposure for 20 minutes to a temperature of 180°F must have to some extent weakened the virulence of the germs. The actual germ of Scarlet Fever has not yet been isolated, but judging from the fact that it can remain virulent for months or even years in clothing it may be assumed that it is a spore bearing organism, and that although exposure of 20 minutes to 180° F. may be sufficient to destroy the germs themselves, it is not sufficient to destroy, although in may diminish, the virulence of the spores. I have had an interview with the Managers and Secretary of the Patriotic Asylum, and have advised them that in future the individual farm from which the milk is obtained should be stated and noted daily, so that there would be no difficulty, as there has been in this outbreak, in tracing the source of the milk and of ascertaining the sanitary conditions of the farm, and the state of the health of the employees as well as of the cows. From the beginning of the outbreak isolation has been carried out as completely as was possible under the circumstances. Of the 117 cases, 15 were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, these 15 being cases in which the symptoms of fever, sore throat, &c., were definite. In the other 102 cases the symptoms 109 Parish of Wondssworth. were so indefinite that the diagnosis was not arrived at until the stage of desquamation, nearly six weeks from the probable date of infection. This fact also made it more difficult to ascertain definitely the exact cause of the outbreak. One theory has suggested itself to me and that is that these 102 cases were not Scarlet Fever at all, but after seeing the majority of the cases and examining them carefully with the Medical Officer of the Institution, 1 came to the conclusion that it could be nothing but Scarlet Fever with mild initial symptoms. Again, a few of the cases had sore-throats, of a very mild and evanescent type about the 18th or 19th of November, and were under observation in the Infirmary for a day or two, but as they had no fever and no rash, were sent back from the Infirmary to the Institution. All these cases desquamated freely. In two cases the Medical Officer informs me that there has been reinfection, two girls whose feet were peeling developing sore-throat, rash and fever. The outbreak is now at an end, although it is quite possible that isolated cases may occur. This still continues to be the most fatal of all the notifiable zymotic diseases. 162 cases were notified, and although this shows a considerable decrease compared with 1897, yet it is an increase compared with 1896, the number in these two years being respectively 243 and 98. Of the 162 cases, 101 or 62.3 per cent. were removed to hospital where 13 died, and 61 cases were treated at home with 14 deaths. The total number of deaths was 27, giving a case mortality of 16.6 per cent., while in 1897 this mortality was 20.1 per cent., and in 1896, 12.2 per cent. 110 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The case mortality of the hospital treated cases was 12.8 per cent., while of the home treated cases this was nearly 23 per cent. There seems no reason to doubt that this great difference in mortality is due to treatment by antitoxin, which is much more extensively carried out in the hospitals of the Asylums Board, than in private practice. It is to be hoped that now the price of this serum has been markedly reduced, all cases in private practice will be immediately treated by means of antitoxin, and that in consequence the mortality will in future years show a decided decrease. During the year 1898, 11,855 cases of Diphtheria were notified in London, or 2.6 per 1,000 of population, compared with 2.9 per 1,000 in 1897, and 3.1 in 1896, while in this parish, the proportion notified per 1,000 of population was in 1898, 2.6, in 1897, 4.3, and in 1896, 1.7. Membranous Croup. Only three cases of this were notified, and no death occurred. The total case mortality from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup was 163 per cent, compared with 202 per cent. in 1897, and 13 per cent. in 1896. • For the whole of London the case mortality was 14.8 per cent. compared with 17 per cent. in 1897, and 19.2 per cent. in 1896. 51 cases were notified and six deaths resulted, Enteric Fever. compared with 37 cases notified and four deaths in 1897. 27 cases were removed to hospital where two died, and 24 cases were treated at home with four deaths. 1ll Parish of Wandsworth. The proportion of cases notified in this parish per 1,000 of population was .84, while in the Metropolis this rate was .69. In three of the cases there was reason to believe that the disease had been contracted from eating of oysters, and in other three from the drinking of water from the river Wandle. In other four of the cases the patients had only come to the district a few days before the disease was diagnosed. In 19 of the cases the sanitary arrangements in the houses occupied by the patients were found to be defective, while in the great majority the sanitary arrangements were good. The annual death-rate per 1,000 from fever was .09, and in the Metropolis .12. Puerperal Fever. deaths in 11 cases were notified and five deaths occurred, compared with six notifications and four 1897. Erysipelas. in 1897. Measles. 100 cases were notified with three deaths, compared with 111 cases and one death This disease was again prevalent in the parish, and more especially in Wards 5 and G. In all 45 deaths were registered, 34 occurring in the parish, and 11 in institutions outside the parish. In 1897 only four deaths occurred, and in 1896, 58. The number of deaths occurring in the parish, viz. 34, was 6'7 above the decennial average, corrected for increase of population. 112 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The death-rate per 1,000 from this disease was .74, and in the Metropolis 69. During the year there were received from the teachers of the Board schools in the parish notices of 540 cases of Measles, but this does not by any means represent the number of cases which occurred during the year. No notices are received from the National or private schools, and it is certain that all the cases were not reported from the Board schools, some of the teachers complying with the regulations of the School Board more than others. Whooping Cough. 25 deaths occurred from this, compared with 12 in 1897, and 53 in 1896. The decennial average was '29'7. One death occurred in an external institution, and one in an institution within the parish. The death-rate in the parish was .41, and in the Metropolis .47 per 1,000. Diarrhoea. During the year, 83 deaths or 43.1 above the decennial average, resulted from Diarrhoea. In 1897, the number of deaths from this cause was 48, and in 1896, 44. One death occurred in an external institution, making a corrected total of 84. 71 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 11 from one to five years, and one over 75 years. The rate per 1,000 was 1.39 compared with .85 in 1897, while in the Metropolis the rate was .96. Of the 84 deaths, 72 occurred between the 29th of June and 29th of September, and special inquiry was made into these cases to ascertain how the children had been fed, whether by hand or nursed by the mother. In all 67 houses, where cases had occurred, were visited, and the particulars ascertained, while in five the parents had removed from the parish. 113 Parish of Wandsworth. The number of cases in the various Wards was as follows:—in No. I. Ward, nine cases; in No. II. Ward, eight cases; in No. III. Ward, 15 cases; in No. IV. Ward, eight cases; in No. V. Ward, 15 cases; in No. VI. Ward, 12 cases. Total 67. Of the 67 cases, 68 were hand-fed, and only four were nursed by the mother. Of the 63 hand-fed cases, 31 were fed on cows milk alone, 14 on condensed milk alone, and 18 on a mixture of both. The sanitary condition of the houses in which these deaths occurred was noted, and in 25 this was good, in 28 fair, and in 14 some defect was found. One important fact was observed, and that was that sufficient care is not taken by the parents as to the storage of the milk after purchase. In many of the houses, there is no proper larder, and in these the milk was kept in any convenient place, such as on a shelf in the kitchen, on the kitchen table, in the kitchen cupboard, or in the scullery. In any of these places, the milk was liable to be contaminated, and if given to an infant would produce severe Diarrhoea, resulting in many cases in death. The above facts only strengthen previous statistics on the subject, and although it is comparatively easy to say what ought to be done to prevent this excessive mortality in infants; it would be a difficult matter to carry out any preventive measures. The one outstanding fact is that infants nursed by the mother suffer little from summer Diarrhoea, and that hand-fed children suffer badly. Influenza. During the year, 25 deaths were registered from this cause, two of these occurring in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and one in St. Peter's i 114 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Hospital. One death occurred in an outside institution, making a corrected total of 23. In 1897, 18 deaths occurred, in 1896, nine, and in 1895, 39. The following are the death-rates per 1,000 of population from zymotic diseases, including those in outlying institutions for the years 1896, 1897, and 1898:— Death-rate per 1000. 1896 1897 1898 Diarrhœa .949 .854 1.399 Diphtheria and Croup Whooping Cough .233 .854 .449 .984 .279 .433 Scarlet Fever .268 .209 .133 Influenza .125 .313 .366 Enteric Fever .073 .069 .091 Measles .. 1.146 .069 .749 Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever show a decided decrease, while Diarrhoea and Measles are markedly increased. Measles, although higher than it was in 1897, is not so high as in the last outbreak, viz. in 1896. It is noticeable that every second year this disease shows a high death-rate per 1,000 of population. 115 Parish of Wandsworth. Notification of Infectious Diseases. Table VI. shows that during 1898, 605 cases of infectious disease were notified, a decrease of 199, compared with 1897, and of 49 compared with 1896. The number of cases of Scarlet Fever was 277, compared with 501 in 1897, and of Diphtheria 162, compared with 243, while of Enteric Fever 51 cases were notified, compared with 37. The annual rate for these notifiable diseases per 1,000 persons living was 9.4, compared with 14 7 in 1897, 111 in 1896, and 9.5 in 1895. In London for the year, this rate was 8.3 per 1,000, compared with 10 2 in 1897, and 11.1 in 1896. The death-rate from all notifiable diseases was .78 per 1,000 compared with 11 in 1897, and .66 in 1896, while for London as a whole this rate was .71, compared with .81 in 1897, and 72 in 1896. The total number of deaths was 49, of which eight occurred from Scarlet Fever, and 27 from Diphtheria. 27 of the deaths occurred at home, and 22 in hospital. The number of the several diseases, the number removed to hospital, and the number of deaths in hospital and at home is given in the following table:— I 2 116 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report.

Mother was told by Medical Practitioner at Stockwell hospital, not to allow the child to sleep with the other children. The second case was notified on January 13th. 117 Parish of Wandsworth. (2).—First case notified on December 21st, 1897, removed to hospital same day, returned on February 23rd, 1895, and a second case was notified on March 1st. (3 and 4).—First case notified as Diphtheria on November 25th, lb97, removed to hospital next day. Mother states he afterwards had Scarlet Fever in hospital, and that his lips were peeling when he returned on February 24th, 1898. A second case was notified on March 3rd, and a third on March 7th. (5).—Six cases notified from October 18th to 23rd, 1897, all were removed to hospital on October 27th. One case returned on February 23rd, 1898, and one of the previous six who had returned earlier, was notified again on March 7th.

These deaths formed 79.8 per cent. of the total mortality, compared with 84-7 in 1897, and 79.5 in 1896. After correction for institutions the total number of deaths was 758, or 77.4 per cent. of the total mortality, compared with 743, or 82.3 per cent. in 1897. 120 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The total number of deaths from tubercular diseases was 115, an increase of 21, compared with 1897, but 08 below the corrected average. The number of deaths in external institutions was 19, and in internal institutions 21, the corrected total being thus 118, compared with 102 in 1897. The total death-rate from all tubercular diseases was 196 per 1,000, compared with 1.79 in 1896. The death-rate in England and Wales for the decennium 1881-90 was 243. From Consumption, or Phthisis Pulraonalis, the corrected number of deaths was 72, compared with 71 in 1897, 61 in 1896, 78 in 1S95, and 75 in 1894. The death-rate was l.23 per 1,000, the same as last year. In the decennium 1881-90 this rate for England and Wales was 1.73. Other tubercular diseases were the cause of 46 deaths, compared with 31 in 1897, and 36 in 1896. 22 of these deaths were of infants under one year, and 12 of children from one to five years. From Gout, Rheumatism, Cancer, and other constitutional diseases, 54 deaths were registered, three less than last year, and 2.9 under the decennial average. Cancer alone was the cause of 41 deaths, compared with 46 in 1897, and 57 in 1896. From diseases of the brain and nervous system there were 101 deaths, compared with 114 in 1897. This shows a decrease also of 28 compared with the decennial average, 46 of these deaths occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, while 24 occurred in external institutions, giving a corrected total of 79, compared with 75 last year. i2i Parish of Wandsworth. 106 deaths were caused by diseases of the organs of circulation, 28 above last year, and 41.2 above the decennial average. 27 deaths occurred in external and 20 in internal institutions, making a corrected total of 113, compared with 121 in 1897, and 100 in 1896. 22 of these deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary. From diseases of the organs of respiration there were 164 deaths, an increase of 47 compared with 1897, but a decrease of 7.3 compared with the decennial average. 20 deaths occurred in external and 18 in internal institutions, the corrected total thus being 166, compared with 136 in 1897, and 1.39 in 1896. The number of deaths from the diseases of the digestive organs was 53 compared with 78 in 1897. 20 of these were of infants under one year. From diseases of the urinary organs, 20 deaths were registered, compared with the same number in 1897, and 23 in 1896. From premature birth, low vitality, and congenital defects there were corrected for institutions 78 deaths, the corrected total in 1897 being 79. All these deaths were of infants under one year, with the exception of one, from one to five years. From old age there were 55 deaths, 14 of males and 41 of females, compared with 56 in 1897, and 43.5 the decennial average. 23 of these deaths occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and seven in internal institutions, 6 in the Union Infirmary, and one in a special hospital). The corrected total is thus 39 compared with 41 in 1897. From violence, 29 deaths occurred, 21 of males and 8 of females, seven more than last year, and 2.9 above 122 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. the corrected average. In internal institutions, four of these deaths occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, one in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and one in the Workhouse, a total of six, while in external institutions three occurred in the Union Infirmary, and five in general or special hospitals, a total of eight. Other four deaths of persons belonging to other parishes were registered in this sub-district. The corrected total thus becomes 27, compared with 25 in 1897, and 24 in 1896. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year was 278, compared with 232 in 1897, and 251 in 1896. 18 deaths occurred in external and four in internal institutions, making a corrected total of 292, compared with 260 in 1897, and 269 in 1896. The infantile death-rate stated per 1,000 births was, corrected for institutions, 169, compared with 156 in 1897. The rate for London for the year 1898 was 166. The percentage of these deaths to the total deaths was, corrected for institutions, 29.8, compared with 28.8 in 1897, and 36.03 in 1896. 120 of these deaths occurred from diseases of the zymotic class, and no fewer than 71 of these were from Diarrhoea, and to this is due the increase in the infantile mortality during the year. Senile Mortality. 141 deaths were registered as over 70 years of age 50 of males and 91 of females. This is a decrease of 58 compared with last year. Three deaths, one of a male and two of females occurred between 95 and 100. Table IX shows the number of these deaths at different quinquennial periods. Parish of Wandsworth. 123 TABLE IX. Age.

Five deaths were not certified by a registered medical practitioner, and were referred to the Coroner, but no inquest was held. The following are the particulars of these deaths:—Female, 32 years, 125 Parish of Wandsworth. Phthisis; male, seven weeks, exhaustion from nonassimilation of food; male, 44 years, Pulmonary Haemorrhage; female, 19 months, Diphtheria; male, six hours, Prematurity, Exhaustion. General Remarks. The death-rate for the year, viz.:—16.31 per 1000 is a higher rate than last year, but is lower than the death-rate of the Metropolis, which was 18.3 per 1,000. This increase was almost wholly due to the number of deaths of infants under one year from Diarrhœa and diseases of the digestive organs. These deaths occurred principally during the months of July, August, and September, when the temperature was high, and the temperature of the earth correspondingly high. It is a well known fact that when this latter temperature is above 60° E. the deaths from Diarrhoea increase markedly, and this year for 11 weeks in the above mentioned months the earth temperature was above 00° E. During the rest of the year the number of deaths was below the average, and the general health of the parish very good. Sanitation. Table XIII. in the general report tabulates the amount of sanitary work carried out by the sanitary inspectors during the year. There were 3,391 houses and premises inspected, compared with 4,597 in 1897, and 3,948 in 1896. The total number of houses inspected in house-tohouse inspection was 1,338, compared with 2,325 in 1897, 1,985 in 1896, and 2,079 in 1895. A large proportion of the time of the sanitary in. spectors was taken up with inspection of drains of new houses, and this accounts for the diminution in the total number of houses inspected during the year, as well as for the large decrease in house-to-house inspection. 126 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 1,114 preliminary and 306 statutory notices were served for the abatement of nuisances compared with 1,158 and 389 in 1897. The number of houses disinfected after infectious diseases was 347, and the number of rooms 388, compared with 643 and 683 in 1897. Disinfection is carried out after all notifiable diseases, with the exception of Erysipelas, unless a certificate is given by the medical attendant that disinfection has been carried out to his satisfaction. During the year this certificate was received in eight cases, and by far the largest proportion of the disinfection was carried out by the officers of the Sanitary Authority. Up to October 21st the disinfection of beds, bedding, etc., by steam, had been done by a contracter, but on and after that date the new disinfector supplied by Manlove Alliott & Co., of Nottingham, was in operation and has worked very satisfactorily. The building, which was designed by Mr. Dodd, the Surveyor, has proved exceedingly suitable and well arranged, and will be sufficient for the needs of the parish for many years. Before October 21st, 329 sets of bedding were disinfected by the contractor, and after that date 101 at the parish disinfecting station. These 101 sets of bedding represent 3,162 articles as follows:—96 beds, 75 bolsters, 212 pillows, 63 mattresses, 196 sheets, 198 palliasses, 134 quilts, 90 cushions, 974 articles of clothing, 247 blankets, 151 carpets, and 726 other articles. I have frequently visited the disinfecting station since it was opened, and supervised the disinfection. I am quite satisfied with the efficiency of the apparatus 127 Parish of Wandsworth. both with reference to the destruction of all germs of infectious disease, and also that with reasonable care no damage can possibly be done to the articles disinfected. The total lots of bedding disinfected this year was 430 compared with 660 in 1897 and 391 in 1896. 26 cases of overcrowding were abated compared with 39 in 1897. In a few instances this overcrowding has been marked, but in the majority it was only slight, and was at once remedied after service of a preliminary notice. Most of the cases of overcrowding were discovered by the sanitary inspector in the course of their houseto-house inspections, and only in one or two instances in consequence of complaint. 192 drains were relaid compared with 239 in 1897, and 252 drains were cleansed and repaired compared with 379. The number of waterclosets cleansed and repaired was 362, a decrease of 124 compared with last year. Water was laid on to 218 waterclosets compared with 251 in 1897. Defective supply of water to waterclosets is a common cause of complaint, and is one of the most common defects ascertained by the sanitary inspectors in their house-to-house inspection. 31 accumulations of manure were dealt with and notices served. Dilapidated, or absence of, dustbins are also frequently discovered by the sanitary inspectors, and 231 of these were supplied during the year. 128 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Two wells were closed by order of the Board, after analysis of the water. The number of unclassified nuisances dealt with was 375 compared with 245 in 1897. Among these may be mentioned; defective traps removed and replaced by gullies, soil pipes repaired and new fixed, domestic water supplies disconnected from cisterns supplying waterclosets, privies cleaned or abolished, smoke nuisances reported (of which there were during the year 68), and damp walls and cellars. In only 11 cases was it necessary to take proceedings at the Police Court, and the following are the particulars of these cases:— (1).—House unfit for human habitation. Fined 6s. costs, and premises to be closed within four weeks. (2).—Sanitary defects. Non-compliance with a nuisance order. Fined 40s. and costs on 1st summons, and 20s. and costs on each of the others. (3).—Non-compliance with order of the Board re drainage; fined 10s. and 21s. costs. (4).—Contravention of Bye-Laws; fined 10s. and 2s. costs. (5).—Sanitary defects. Order made for work to be done within 14 days, and for payment of 10s, Gd. costs. (6).—Sanitary defects; fined 20s. and 4s. costs. (7).—Non-compliance with Bye-Laws as to houses let in lodgings; fined 10s. and 2s. costs. (8).—Sanitary defects. Summons withdrawn on payment of 2s. costs. (9).—Overcrowding; nuisance abated, and costs paid. 129 Parish of Wandsworth. (10).—Exposing for sale rabbits unfit for food; fined £10 and 4s. costs. (11).—Gipsies on land, failing to provide sanitary convenience. Owner of land fined 20s. and 2s. These, 7 in number, were as usual inspected and found to be in a satisfactory condition. slaughter Houses, Eight slaughter-houses and one knackers' yard were inspected, and their condition found to be satisfactory. One slaughter-house was deleted from the register, as the owners did not apply for a renewal of the licence. Bake-houses 40 bake-houses have been duly inspected, but no notices were necessary as all the cleansing had been carried out satisfactorily. unsound Food. One bag of winkles, one box of haddock, 60 rabbits in two boxes, one box of rabbits, one cask of grapes, and one case of fresh herring were destroyed during the year, being unfit for food. Factory and During the year 109 (20 factories and 89 workshops. workshops) were inspected. The following notices were served and complied with—one offensive watercloset, one defective paving and watercloset, one no water to watercloset, five defective apparatus to waterclosets, one earth closet, one dirty and defective watercloset, four dilapidated dust bins, one defective yard drain, one leaky roof, one dilapidated paving, two dirty watercloset basins, and dirty condition of the works, in all 20. No notices were during the year received from the Factory Inspector. K 130 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Houses Let in Lodgings. There are now 17 of these on the register, and except in one case where proceedings were taken, all the usual cleansing and lime-whiting way carried out. I have again much pleasure in reporting that the Sanitary Inspectors have performed all their duties to my entire satisfaction. P. CALDWELL SMITH, m.&., m.d., d.p.h , camb., Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth, ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done under the Sale of Food and Drags Act, condensed from his statutory quarterly reports, by THE PUBLIC ANALYST. During the year 1898 the Inspector brought to the South London Central Public Laboratory 598 samples of Food and Drugs, while 8 were handed in by members of the Public in accordance with the provisions of the Act, thus making a total of 606 articles classifiable s follows:— Dairy produce 373 Groceries 179 Bread and Cereals 32 Drugs 10 Confectionery 6 Alcoholic Beverages 6 606 The following Tables indicate the nature and number of the various articles examined and the results their analysis. I.—Dairy Produce. The articles entered under this head included:— Milk 213 samples. Butter 140 „ Condensed Milk 2 „ Lard 5 „ Cheese 4 „ Margarine 9 „ Total 373 samples. 132 Report—Public Analyst. All these were legally genuine, except the following 23 which were found to be more or less deficient:— Articles submitted. Nature and extent of Impurity. Milk. 17 per cent. of added water. Milk 11 „ ,, Milk 10 „ ,, Milk 9 ,, ,, Milk 8 „ „ Milk 7 ,, ,, Milk 6 ,, ,, Milk 5 ,, ,, Milk 5 ,, ,, Milk 33 per cent. of cream deficient. Milk 18 ,, „ Milk 18 „ ,, Milk 16 „ ,, Milk 15 ,, ,, Butter 90 per cent. of Margarine. Butter 90 ,, ,, Butter 80 ,, ,, Butter 80 „ „ Butter 75,, ,, Butter 70 ,, ,, Butter 66 „ „ Butter 50 „ „ Butter 20 „ ,, The above table shows that 6.56 per cent. of the milk samples departed from the accepted standard of purity, while in the case of butter 6.42 per cent. of the samples contained margarine. This indicates an improvement in the general milk supply, but a very marked falling off in that of butter:—the figures in 1897 being 11.31 for milk and 2.59 for butter. The local milk adulteration, as distinguished from farmer's samples, was 6.25 in 1697 so that there has been a slight increase in sophistication traceable to dealers within the district, while the farmer's adulteration has been checked. 13i Report—Public Analyst. II.— Groceries. These included:— Coffee 48 samples Pepper 20 „ Cocoa 19 „ Sugar 19 „ Mustard 20 „ Tapioca 20 „ Sago 14 „ Jams 7 „ Arrowroot 6 „ Semolina 6 ,, Total 179 The following three were found to be adulterated as under:— Articles submitted. Nature and extent of impurity. Coffee 30 per cent. of chicory. Coffee 10 Cocoa 60 per cent of arrowroot & sugar. III.—Bread and Cereals. The following articles were examined and found genuine:— Flour 27 samples. Bread 5 „ Total 32 IV.—Alcoholic Beverages. Two samples of whiskey and four of gin were submitted, and the following three were condemned:— Articles submitted. Result of Analyses. Whiskey 8 degrees below legal strength. Gin 13 ,, ,, Gin 1.8 ,, ,, 134 Report—Public Analyst. V.— Confectionery. The samples submitted were six in number, consisted of three chocolate sweets, and three ice creams. They were found to contain no deleterious ingredients and were therefore classed as "genuine." IV.—Drugs. The articles received under this head embraced three samples of glycerine, two of Gregory's Powder, two of Ipecacuanha wine, two of medicines as prescribed and one of Laudanum ; all being found correct. In conclusion, I can only again assert that the food supply of the Wandsworth District was, during the year, in a satisfactory condition, although not quite so good as in 1897; the relative percentages of total adulteration being 4.69 in 1897 and 4.79 in 1898.
