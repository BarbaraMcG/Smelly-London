Twenty-Ninth Annual Report OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Bang a Report for the year 1884 on the Vital and Sanitary condition of the Parish of Lambeth. Gentlemen, During the year 1884 an inspection has been made of the houses situated in the courts and small streets in the Parish of Lambeth, constituting the dwellings of the laboring classes. The work was carried out by your Sanitary Inspectors with the assistance of six men temporarily engaged for the purpose. The inquiry was directed to the Sanitary condition of the interior and external surroundings of the houses inspected. 2 The inspection of the interior comprised 1. Condition of walls, ceilings, &c., relating to (a) Cleanliness. (b) Dilapidation. 2. Condition of the drains (a) Stoppage. (b) Trapping. (c) General defects. 3. Condition of closet (a) Repair. (b) Water-supply. (c) Fittings, &c. 4. Condition of ventilation. 5. Condition of water-supply (a) Constant. (b) Intermittent. (c) Storage. 6. Number of inmates with respect to over-crowding. 7. Existence of offensive odours, epidemic disease rats, &c. The inspection of the exterior comprised:— 1. Condition of the yard. (a) Paving. (b) Drainage. (c) Cleanliness, &c. 2. Condition of receptacle for dust. (a) Sufficiency. (b) Covering. (c) Repair. 3 3. Condition of cistcrn. (a) Covering. (b) Connection by waste-pipe. (c) Cleanliness, &c. The number of houses visited was 11,493, of these 5,594 required sanitary improvements. Many of the houses were unhealthy and dilapidated owing to the habits of the tenants, who at times are careless, dirty, and destructive. Some houses in which lime-washing had been done a few months before were found again in a dirty condition; fittings recently repaired were found again broken; dustbins destroyed; cistern-lids removed, and the plaster torn from the walls. After making allowance for defects thus brought about, there were a large number with which the tenant had nothing to do. In 2158 houses there was not any arrangement for a supply of water to the closets. In 541 cases the yards were not paved or the paving was bad. In 216 cases the yards were not drained, and in 28 cases the waste pipe of the cistcrn had connection with the soil-pipe. In many houses several defects were reported, bringing up the total of the sanitary improvements required to 12,014. The following list shews the character of these requirements Houses in which lime-washing was required 1257 Houses in which dilapidations existed 917 Houses in which there were complaints of offensive odours, &c. 216 Houses in which drains were stopped 114 Houses in which the drains were not trapped or otherwise defective 1326 Houses with defective ventilation 9 4 Houses with deficient water-supply 15 Closets out of repair or with defective fittings 1969 Cisterns without covers 240 Yards dirty, accumulation of dust or garbage 976 Houses without dustbins or dustbins defective or without proper covers 2032 The inspection was commenced on December 5th, 1883, and on April 5th, 1884, the provisional inspectors were discharged. After each day's inspection the owners of property were served with a formal notice to make the necessary improvements, and in a large number of the houses the work was done without delay. On April 7th I was able to report to your Sanitary Committee that all the work had been done with the exception of 561 cases of a minor character; these works have since been completed. POPULATION. The estimated population of the Parish of Lambeth, based upon the number of inhabited houses and calculated at the middle of the year to which this Report refers, is 262,827, showing an increase of 688 above the estimated population of the previous year. The percentage of inmates of houses in the various districts remain so constant that the population may be estimated in a fairly accurate manner. The average number of inhabitants in each house in the metropolis in the census of 1861 stood at 9.8; it stood at the same figure in the census of 1871; and did not vary one decimal point in 1881. The number of inhabited houses in each registration district, with the average percentage of inmates, based upon the census of 1881, is given below. 5 The total number of inhabited houses is 37,243; in 1883 the total number was 37,183, showing an increase of 60 inhabited houses.

The Ratio being 13.07 to 1 compared with Lambeth. 6 The following Table shows the number of statute acres in each district with the estimated population and the average number of persons per acre. Registration Districts. Estimated Population. Area in Acres. Population per Acre. Waterloo Road, 1st 15321 67 228.6 Waterloo Road, 2nd 15811 100 158.1 Lambeth Church, 1st 21029 162 129.8 Lambeth, Church, 2nd 40263 186 216.4 Kennington, 1st 46802 490 95.5 Kennington, 2nd 35128 498 78.6 Brixton 66131 1429 46.3 Norwood 22342 1009 22.1 The Parish of Lambeth comprises 3941 acres with an average population of 66.6 per acre. The area of the metropolis is 78,052 acres, with a population of 51.5 per acre. On comparing the estimated population of each district with that of 1883, an increase is noted in Waterloo Road 1st of 380 or 5 6 persons per acre; in Lambeth Church 1st of S08 or 5 persons per acre; in Lambeth Church 2nd of 33 or .Z persons per acre; in Brixton of 114 or .1 person per acre; in Norwood of 745 or .7 persons per acre. A decrease is noted in Waterloo Road 2nd of 108, in Kennington 1st of 112, in Kennington 2nd of 1172. 7 BIRTH RATE. In 1884 the birth rate was in excess of the previous year by 308 births. The registered number was 9517 to 9209 of 1883. This represents a birth rate at 37.5 per 1000. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 33.7. Thus there arc 961 more children born in Lambeth than there are to a corresponding population, taking the Metropolis as a whole. This fact should be born in mind when considering the death rate, for the death rate in children is always greater than the death rate in adults, and so the greater number of births will tend to swell the death rate. The number of births and the rate per 1000 of the population in the several registration districts is as follows:— District No. of Birth. Percentage. Waterloo Road, 1st 627 41.2 Waterloo Road, 2nd 895 54.8 Lambeth Church, 1st 723 36.3 Lambeth Church, 2nd 1828 45.8 Kennington, 1st 1662 36.6 Kennington, 2nd 1020 28.9 Brixton 2094 33.3 Norwood 668 35.1 8 The number of births in the year in the following table are compared with the number of births for each year in the last ten years. 1875 8567 1876 8970 1877 8783 1878 8984 1879 9250 1880 9224 1881 8945 1882 9250 1883 9209 1884 9517 Of the 9517 births, 4807 were males and 4710 females, showing that the number of boys born exceeded the number of girls by 97. The following table shows the number of males and females born in the several registration districts and compared in each quarter of the year. 9 BIRTHS.

During 1884, 2349 marriages were celebrated in Lambeth, showing a marriage rate of 18.4 per 1000. The metropolitan rate being 18.6 per 1000. During last year 2365 marriages were celebrated in Lambeth, thus the marriages have decreased by 16. That the marriages have not kept pace with the increase of the population is shown by a comparison of the number of marriages in the last ten years.

During the year, 5537 deaths have been registered in Lambeth, 2810 males and 2727 females; of these 395 were strangers who died in the public institutions—deducting these, the deaths proper to the Parish numbered 5142 thus the death rate for the year is 20.2 per 1000. The metropolitan rate for the same period being 20.3 per 1000. 11 The following Table shows the mortality, male and female, in the different districts, and a comparison of the deaths in each quarter.

This rate is one decimal point less than last year, when it stood at 20.4. The highest rate on record was in 1849 when it stood at 30.1 per 1000. In the districts of London the death rate was as follows:— West districts 19.2 North „ 19.1 Central „ 23.8 East „ 23.0 South „ 19.8 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases includes 923 parishioners and 122 strangers. This shows an increase of 267 upon last years figures 656 parishioners having died from diseases in 1883. The Zymotic deaths from each quarter were—March, 192; June, 326; September, 371; December, 170; or, deducting the strangers, March, 174; June, 290; September, 335; December, 124. This represents a Zymotic rate for Lambeth of 3.6 per 1000 living. The metropolitan rate for the same period being 3.3 per 1000. The following Table shows the deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases in each month of the year, divided so as to correspond with the monthly reports to the Vestry.

During the year to which this report refers, a severe epidemic of Small Pox occurred in the Metropolis. The disease first made its appearance in an epidemic form in the northern districts of London, spreading to the north-east. In November, 1883, 15 cases were admitted to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board from the Parish of Hackney, and in December, 38 cases from the same district. In January, 1884, the disease appeared in Lambeth, the first case occurred in Trinity Square, and was reported on the 8th; the person attacked was a domestic servant who had been staying in the north of London a fortnight previously; she was removed into Hospital. The second case occurred in the Sandmere Road about the 22nd, a third case in the Kennington Park Road about the 26th, and a fourth case in the Bedford Road. These cases were apparently unconnected with one another, and the source of contagion very uncertain. In February, one rase only was reported, while in the north, north east, western, and central districts, 73 cases were sent to Hospital. In March, the Parish was quite free from the disease, not one case having been reported, but in the northern districts of London the epidemic was becoming severe—from Hackney alone, in this month, 102 cases were removed. During the third week in April, the disease again made its appearance in Lambeth; five cases were reported in the Inner Wards between the x 6th and 30th of the month. During May, cases were reported almost daily, they were distributed over the Parish, many cases occurring in the neighbourhood of the Stockwell Hospital: 28 cases occurred during the month. At this time, namely, the end of May, there were 1,057 cases under treatment at the Asylums Board Hospitals. 24 In June, the number of attacks increased, 52 cases occurred in Lambeth—from the whole of the Metropolis, over 1,200 were removed to the Hospitals. The Asylums Board at this time altered their arrangements in regard to the removal and reception of patients. Mild cases were sent thenceforth direct to the ships, and the convalescents from the various Hospitals were transferred to the ships or the Convalescent Camp at Darenth, only a limited number of severe cases were allowed to remain in the Hospitals. From this time the epidemic dates its decline. Whether this decline was brought about by the new policy of the Hoard, I am not prepared to say, but if not so, it is a remarkable coincidence, that almost immediately after "direct" removals became the practice of the Board, the epidemic showed a tendency to decrease. In July, 36 cases were reported, falling to 23 in August, and falling again in September to three. At this time the epidemic was at an end, and only a few cases occurred in October and November, but in December the disease again assumed an epidemic form. In the distribution of Small Pox in Lambeth there are some points of special interest. A considerable percentage of cases are reported in the district of Stockwell; other parts of the Parish suffered, many cases occurring in the Inner Wards, but Stockwell was the only district in which a large number of cases were found in a small area. What was the cause of this selection ? The drainage in this locality compares favourably with other parts of the Parish; the houses in most parts have been built within the last few years. Diphtheria and typhoid are not frequent; the dwellings are not overcrowded, and are occupied by a respectable middle class. In endeavouring to arrive at a just conclusion as to the cause of the selection of this neighbourhood by the disease then 25 epidemic in other parts of the Metropolis, I think it necessary to consider the relation which the affected district bears to the Hospital of the Asylums Board which is approximate to it. The Hospital is situated in its own grounds, and bounded on the north side by the Landor Road, into which opens its way of approach; on its south side lies the Fever Hospital and the London, Chatham & Dover Railway; on the west is an open space partially built on, the roads being unfinished; and on the cast arc some stables and a row of houses which face upon and form the west side of Hargwynne Street. The Hospital is composed of several blocks, the block on the north side being set apart for Small Pox patients. In 1882, Dr. Buchanan, in his report to the Local Government Hoard, draws attention to the circumstances relating to the epidemic in the neighbourhood of the Fulham Hospital, and to an investigation upon it made by Dr. Thorne, in association with Mr. Power. The following arc the conclusions arrived at from this enquiry:— "There has been in each epidemic period, an excessive increase of Small Pox in houses in the neighbourhood of the Fulham Hospital, as compared with more distant houses in Chelsea, Fulham, and Kensington. "The percentage of the houses included in the neighbourhood of the Hospital has become gradually smaller as the distance from the Hospital has increased. "Houses upon the chief lines of human intercourse with the Hospital have not suffered more than houses lying in other directions from the Hospital. "In point of time there has been a very marked relation between the varying use of the Hospital and the manifestations of excessive Small Pox in the neighbourhood. This manifestation has not shown itself while the use of the Hospital was for convalescents only. 26 "On comparison of different epidemics an almost constant ratio is observed between the amount of the Hospital operations and the degree of excess of Small Pox in the neighbourhood." Mr. Power then concludes by saying:—"There must be some condition or conditions operating to produce the observed distribution of Small Pox around the Hospital that have pertained to the Hospital as such, and that have been in excess of the conditions for Small Pox extension as usually recognised." The Report goes on to say— "I have no choice but to accept the above conclusions, and to believe that the Fulham Hospital, with all its advantages of site and construction, and with the many excellences of its administration, has, by dissemination of Small Pox material through the atmosphere, given rise to an exceptional prevalence of Small Pox in its neighbourhood" From this report it is clear that an excess of Small Pox existed in the neighbourhood of the Fulham Hospital, and I can show that the same thing occurred at Stockwell, not, I think, by dissemination of Small Pox material through the atmosphere, but in some other way. It is instructive to notice the distribution of the disease in this epidemic when a large number of patients were under treatment at the Hospital, and compare it with a later epidemic when the Hospital contained only a few cases. Small Pox assumed an epidemic form in Lambeth in April, and in the third week of that month two cases occurred in the same house in Stamford Street, followed by other cases in the Inner Wards, apparently having no connection with one another. Then one case occurred at the Industrial Schools at Norwood. Then, on May 3rd, a case occurred in the Stockwell District (Tandridge Place), followed on the 19th by one in Willington Road; on the 26th by one in Edithna Street, and one in Dalyell Road; on the 28th by one in Theobald's Buildings, 27 and on the 31st by a case in Andalus Road. The houses where these six cases took place being all within a quarter of a mile from the Hospital. In the following tables the cases are arranged in areas. The quarter-mile area is made by taking the Hospital as a centre on the map, and with a radius of a quarter-mile drawing a circle; in like manner the half-mile and mile areas are formed by taking half mile or mile as the radius. 6 cases within ¼ mile area. 2 „ ½ „ 1 „ 1 „ 18 between the 1 and 3 mile area. Thus 22.2 per cent. of all cases occurring in Lambeth are found within a quarter of a mile of the Hospital. In June, the proportion became more marked, the number of cases under treatment in the Hospital had been very largely increased, and we find in the quarter-mile area also a large increase. 24 cases within ¼ mile area. 3 „ ½ „ 9 „ ½ „ 16 eases between the 1 and 3 mile area. Thus, in June, 46.1 per cent. of all cases occurring in Lambeth were found in the quarter-mile area. In July, the number of cases under treatment in the Hospital were fewer in number; cases were being conveyed direct from their homes to the Hospital Ships and to the Camp, and the epidemic was declining. 13 cases within ¼ mile area. 3 „ ½ „ 10 „ 1 „ 10 cases between 1 and 3 mile area. 36.1 per cent. within the quarter-mile area. 28 In August, the last month of this epidemic, 23 cases occurred, and they were thus distributed:— 10 within the ¼ mile area. 4 „ ½ „ 3 „ 1 „ 6 between the 1 and 3 mile area. So that 43 4 per cent. of the cases occurred within the ¼-mile area. On the 29th of August, a case was removed from Stansfield Road to the Hospital, and this was the last of the Small Pox epidemic. Between April 16th and August 29th inclusive, 143 cases occurred; of these, 53 occurred within the ¼-mile area, being 37 06 per cent. In December, Small Pox again became epidemic in Lambeth, 51 cases occurring during the month; of this number seven occurred within the ¼-mile area, or 13.7 per cent. As the direct system of transfer of patients was now in active operation, the cases under treatment in the Hospitals were few. The excess of Small Pox in the neighbourhood of Fulham Hospital, was, by the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, attributed to dissemination of Small Pox particles by the air. I think that a study of this epidemic does not lead one to the same conclusion, but rather that this prevalence is in some way due to the traffic to and from the Hospital, or to dissemination by continuity of drainage. If this outbreak was due to aerial dissemination, we should expect to find the disease evenly distributed in the ¼-mile area, but this was not the case. The houses attacked were for the most part, upon the north side, and near the lines of communication with the Hospital. I said that the south side of the Hospital was bounded by the London, Chatham & Dover Railway. This line running from Brixton to Clapham, bi-sects both the ¼ and ½-mile areas. There is no direct means of transit between the north and 29 south sides of this line between the two points where it bi-sects the ¼-mile area, and a greater part of the south section of the ½-mile area is also cut off from any direct communication with the Hospital approaches by this line of railway. The lines of sewage are divided as well as the roads. Now, in this area, so cut off from the Hospital, during the whole of the epidemic only three eases occurred, one in the ¼ mile area and two in the ½-mile area. This line of rails is not many feet above the level of the surrounding ground, and we find on one side 52 cases, and onlyone on the other side within the ¼ mile area. 1 think it is a fair inference that the want of continuity of road and sewer communication may have some part in the unequal distribution of the disease, as this barrier could scarcely interfere with the dissemination of the disease through the air. Again, on the cast side, the Hospital is bounded by the houses on the west side of Hargwynne Street, the windows in the backs of these houses look out upon the Hospital buildings and grounds. There are 75 houses in this row. These houses are mostly occupied by two or three families. Surely, if the disease spreads by aerial dissemination we should have found some people in these houses affected. Say there is an average of eight people in each house, there we have a population of 600 of all ages, within a few yards of the Hospital, and yet we do not find one case of Small Pox in these houses. VACCINATION. Of the 227 cases which occurred during the year, 148 had been vaccinated, 28 cases had not been vaccinated, and 51 were doubtful. Vaccinated 65.2 per cent. Unvaccinated 12.3 per cent. Doubtful 22.4 per cent. 30 Of the 227 cases occurring, 25 cases died, or 11 per cent An analysis of the fatal cases showed that there had been 10 deaths in vaccinated persons, 13 deaths in unvaccinated persons and two cases were returned as doubtful. So the percentage of deaths in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons would read as follows:— Vaccinated 6.7 per cent of deaths. Unvaccinated 46.4 „ „ The value of vaccination in lessening the fatality of this disease is plainly shown by these figures. In the same ratio in every 100 persons attacked who had been vaccinated, only seven persons would die; in an equal number who had not been vaccinated, 46 people would die. The public are now much more alive to the value of perfect isolation, and consequently are more ready to avail themselves of the advantages offered to their infectious sick by the Asylums Board. Of the 227 cases of Small Pox, 207 were removed to Hospital, leaving only 20 to be treated at home; in all these cases isolation was efficiently carried out. Only three paupers were reported to have been removed to the Hospital, the remaining 204 cases belonging to the middle and working classes. The following table shows the number of Small Pox cases removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board during the last eight years, and the proportion of paupers to the whole number admitted:— 1877 26 Paupers 577 Non-Paupers 1878 20 „ 277 „ 1879 1 „ 277 „ 1880 1 „ 77 „ 1881 14 „ 80 „ 1882 24 „ 440 „ 1883 0 „ 109 „ 1884 3 „ 207 „ Making a total during the eight years of 1,895, of which 89 were paupers, or, Non-paupers 95.3 percent. Paupers 47 „ 31 The deaths registered from Small Pox in Lambeth numbered 55. 30 of these were strangers in the Stockwell Hospital so that only 25 parishioners died. In the metropolis in 1881 2367 persons died from Small Pox, in 1882,431 persons died and in 1883 the number fell to 134, and in 1884 the number rose to 913. SMALL POX. Sub-District. No. of Deaths.

The number of deaths from Scarlet Fever in the Parish ot Lambeth was 104; of these 44 were strangers, 43 of whom died in the Stockwell Fever Hospital, and one in St. Thomas's Hospital. Deducting these the deaths of parishioners number 60 against 86 in 1883, and 96 in 1882. The following Table shows the number of cases in each district, both those sent to Hospital and those treated at home. An outbreak of Scarlet Fever occurred at the hospital for lying-in women, York Road, and was exterminated with no little difficulty. The first cases were reported upon February 16th, when five women and 3 infants were removed to the Stockwell Fever Hospital. On March 14th the disease again appeared, also upon April 25th, May 1st, and lastly upon June 12th. After each outbreak the wards were disinfected by the Hospital Authorities and the bedding stoved. I am inclined to believe that the frequent re appearance of the disease was due to the insufficiency of the stoving.

On account of information received on Saturday evening, July 26, from Inspector Coxhead, that a consignment of rags, seized at the Port of London, en route from Marseilles, was to be burnt at the city wharf, within the Parish of Lambeth, an investigation was made, and it was found that a number of bales were hourly expected, and that the city authorities had given permission to the port authorities to burn these rags at the city wharf Instructions were given that no rags should be landed, and a verbal undertaking to that effect was received by the foreman of the yard. The danger of destroying rags at the wharf would have been great. The rags had been collected in a town where deaths from cholera had numbered as many as 60 a day, and the epidemic must have been at its height at the time of collection. In order to burn the rags it would have been necessary to open the bales, as the largest opening into the furnace is not sufficient to receive the bales unopened, so that the workmen doing the work might have been readily infected. Again, in working the destructor, often large pieces of unburnt material are carried up the shaft, and fall in the neighbouring yards. It was arranged that frequent visits should be made by Inspector Coxhead during Saturday night and Sunday, so that nothing could be landed without his knowledge. On Monday morning a consultation took place with the Clerk to the Vestry in reference to what legal proceedings could be taken to prevent the city authorities from making use of the destructor for such purpose. The Medical Officer and Clerk to the Vestry visited the wharf, but they were unable to get from the Superintendent any sufficient guarantee that the bales would not be landed and passed through 48 the destructor. They then attended at the office of the Commissioners of Sewers at the Guildhall. At first, the Assistant Clerk, then in charge (owing to the absence of Mr. Blake, the Clerk), objected to give any undertaking, but on the Clerk to the Vestry threatening that if no undertaking was given he would that day apply to the Chancery Division of the High Court lor an Injunction, the Assistant Clerk, after communicating with Dr. Saunders, the Medical Officer of the City, gave an undertaking that no rags should be opened and burnt at the wharf without 24 hours' notice in writing to the Vestry. The Sanitary Committee fully endorsed the action of the Vestry Officers, and the following is a copy of the correspondence whit h ensued on the subject. Vestry Hall, Kennington Green. 1 st August, 1884. Sir, I am directed by the Sanitary Committee of this Vestry to call your attention to the recent attempt of the authorities of the Port of London to send for destruction at your wharf in Lambeth, rags, which, having come from Marseilles were considered so dangerous as to be stopped by the Medical Officer of the Port. Before these rags could have been destroyed at your wharf, it would have been necessary for the bales to have been opened by your men, as the bales are in themselves too large to be put through the holes leading to the machine for destruction. In opening out the bales and separating the rags, I need hardly say how great the danger would have been to the workmen, and as at the present time it is quite common for whole pieces of paper, unburnt, to be blown out of the chimney and fall in the surrounding neighbourhood, pieces of infected rags might in the same way have been blown out in a similar manner, to the possible danger of the inhabitants around. I am directed by the Sanitary Committee to enter their protest against any attempt of your Commissioners to allow the wharf to 49 We used for the destruction of any infected articles, and I think hat your Commissioners-trust themselves sec the impropriety of anything of the sort being allowed. I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, To the Clerk, Henry J. Smith, Commissioners of Sewers, Clerk to the Vestry. Guildhall, E.C. Vestry Hall, Kennington Green. 4th August, 1884. Sir, The Sanitary Committee of this Vestry during the last en days were informed that some rags, supposed to have come rom Marseilles, were stopped by the Port Authorities of London, and that it was suggested by the Medical Officer of the Port that they should be sent to the wharf in Lambeth, belonging to the Commissioners of Sewers, to be burnt As the rags could not have been passed through the machinery without the bales being first opened, and the rags separated by the men in charge at the wharf, the Medical Officer of Health of this Parish (I)r. Verdon) at once applied to the Officers at the wharf for an undertaking that the rags should not even be landed at the wharf. Dr. Verdon not getting any satisfactory undertaking, I attended with Dr. Verdon at the City Offices of the Commissioners on the subject, and from the information given there it appeared that the Medical Officer of the Commissioners had entertained the suggestion that the rags should be taken to the Lambeth wharf, but after considerable discussion, the Clerk in charge gave Dr. Verdon and myself an undertaking that the rags should not be opened and burnt at the wharf without twenty-four hours' notice to the Vestry. I believe, that in consequence of the objections of the Vestry, the rags have been taken out to sea and sunk 50 I am directed by the Sanitary Committee to call your attention to the matter, under the hope that you will give the Port Authorities the necessary instructions to prevent any chance of articles, supposed to be infected, being again sent to the Lambeth wharf. I need hardly point out the great danger which might arise from infected rags, or other articles being opened and handled by the men at the wharf. I have the honor to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, To the President of the Henry J. Smith, Board of Trade, Clerk to the Vestry. Whitehall. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 23rd October, 1884. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward, for the information of the Vestry of the Parish of Lambeth, the accompanying copy of a communication, which they have received from the Port of London Sanitary Committee, in reference to certain bales of rags imported from Marseilles, and referred to in your letter of the 4th of August. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, To H. J. Smith, Esq., Alfred D. Adnan, Vestry Clerk for the Assistant Secretary Parish of Lambeth, Vestry Hall, Kennington Green, S.E. 51 Guildhall, E.C. 8/7/ October, 1884. Sir, In reply to your letter of the 8th August (76,661 K 2) enclosing copy of a letter from the Lambeth Vestry, respecting certain rags from Marseilles, alleged to have been landed at Lambeth wharf, I beg to state that the circumstances in respect thereto, have been fully investigated by the Port of London Sanitary Committee, who now instruct me to say that the bales of rags in question (previously disinfected) were intended to be destroyed unopened, each bale being lifted from the barge into the furnace, and the Committee feel satisfied that the course, which, it was suggested should be carried out, was a wise one, and free from all possible risk. In deference, however, to the wishes of the Vestry of Lambeth, the Committee reluctantly abandoned the suggestion, and disposed of the rags in another way. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, To the Secretary of the John B. Monckton. Local Govcrmcnt Board. 52 The Sanitary Work done by the Inspectors will be seen by reference to the following Tables, &c.

In order to carry out the provisions of this Act, an inspection was made of 79 houses let in tenements, and a register kept of the following particulars relating to them:— Name and address of landlord. Total number of rooms. Total number of rooms let in lodgings. 53 Description of each room let in lodgings. Manner of use of room, whether used exclusively or partly as sleeping-room. Sex and age of occupants. Name of lessee of rooms. Cubic capacity of rooms. Sanitary improvements were carried out in those houses in which these matters were defective, the principal being defective water-supply. THE STOVE FOR THE DISINFECTION OF BEDDING AND OTHER INFECTED ARTICLES. In the early part of 1884, I commenced some experiments with the object of testing the value of the process for disinfection of the bedding in fever and small pox cases, carried out at the wharf. After several experiments it was found that the linen and calico coverings of bedding became scorched at any temperature above 250', it was also found that in the centre of a feather pillow, a greater temperature than i3o° could not be reached without scorching the covering. At the centre of a flock pillow the maxim temperature attained was 215° without scorching the cover, so for purposes of disinfection the maximum capacity of the apparatus was For flock bedding, 2150 For feather bedding, 180° These temperatures are not sufficiently high to destroy the germs of infectious disease, indeed, it has been decided on competent authority, that the germs of many diseases are not destroyed below a dry temperature of 270° Fahrenheit. In order to obtain a higher temperature without scorching, a quantity of water was placed in vessels on the floor of the stove, and the temperature of the stove raised until a thermometer 59 laying on the flock pillow registered 340°, the central temperature being 280°. Feather pillows were subjected to the same treatment, but it was found impossible to raise the central heat much above 200°, while the water remained in the stove there was no scorching. By these experiments the following conclusions were arrived at, viz.:— That flock bedding could be safely and efficiently disinfected by means of moist heat. That feather bedding by the same process was imperfectly disinfected. At this time some alterations being in progress at the wharf, and the site of the stove being required for other purposes, it was determined to rebuild upon another site, a good opportunity thus presenting itself of improving its construction. The stove is now a very perfect disinfecting apparatus. By a system of perforated pipes arranged round the walls steam can be thrown into the interior at pleasure, and a sufficient moisture produced to prevent scorching. It is lined with perforated asbestos, and all articles for disinfection are subjected to a moist heat of 300° to 320°, maintained for 20 minutes. Over 200 observations have been made with the new disinfector upon various articles of bedding, and the result has been eminently satisfactory, viz.:— Articles subjected to disinfection have not been discolored. The temperature to which the articles have been exposed has been sufficient to destroy the germs of disease. RETAIL BAKEHOUSES. The provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, freedom from overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions in bakehouses, were prior to the Act of last Session, enforced by Her Majesty's Inspectors of Factories. 6o The effect of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, is that these duties in the metropolis are now imposed upon the Vestries and District Boards. In the Parish of Lambeth there are 242 bakehouses; to each of these the following regulations have been sent. 1. The bakehouse shall be kept in a cleanly state and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. 2. The bakehouse shall not be overcrowded so as to be injurious to health. 3. The bakehouse shall be well ventilated. 4. The paint of the bakehouse or passage leading thereto shall be washed with soap and water every six months, and renewed with three coats of paint or varnish every seven years. 5. All parts of the bakehouse and its passages, walls, and ceilings not painted shall be limewashed every six months, viz, in March and September. 6. No place on the same level as a bakehouse, or in the same building shall be used as a sleeping-room, except it is completely separated from the bakehouse by a partition from floor to ceiling, and unless there is an external glazed window of 9 superficial feet in area, of which 4½ superficial feet are made to open for ventilation. 7. No closet or ashpit shall be within or communicate directly with the bakehouse. 8. The cistern supplying water to the bakehouse shall be separate from the cistern supplying the closet. 9. No drain or pipe for carrying off sewage matter shall have a direct opening within the bakehouse. Of the 242 bakehouses when inspected 134 required sanitary improvements, 92 were dirty, in 60 the drains were not trapped, 6 were badly ventilated, one was dilapidated, in one an offensive smell existed, in one the drain was stopped, in 36 there was no 61 Water supply to the closet, in 5 the water supply to closet was defective, in one the waste pipe to cistern was connected with the in two the closets were in bad repair, in 2 the closet fittings there defective, in one the cistern was uncovered. The yards were dirty in two cases and badly paved in two cases; in 5 stances there was no dust-bin, in 5 instances a water closet depend direct into the bakehouse. All these defects had been medied, and the bakehouses placed in a sanitary condition. WATER SUPPLY. The water supplied by the Lambeth and Southwark Water companies has been throughout the year clear, bright, and well On one occasion only was the water slightly turbid. Weight of solid matter in 100,000 parts of the water:— Southwark. Lambeth.
