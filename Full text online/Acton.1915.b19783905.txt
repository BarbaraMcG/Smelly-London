Council Offices, Acton, London, W. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Acton. Miss Smee and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1915. For obvious reasons, many of the details usually inserted have been omitted and as much as possible of the report has been given in the form of tables. Some explanations are necessary. The civil population is estimated at 58,238. It will be observed that this is a reduction as compared with the population of 1914. The following memorandum of the Registrar General will explain the method which has been adopted and the reason for its adoption. The war has made it impossible to adhere to the methods of estimation of local and national populations hitherto in use. Men of military age have been largely drafted to military training centres or sent abroad with the army, and the remainder of the male adult population has migrated on an unprecedented scale into areas other than those in which it was enumerated at the last census. 6 Under these circumstances, estimates of local populations based on the census returns were clearly inadmissable, and it became necessary to search for a substitute. Fortunately this was ready to hand in the shape of the National Register, which referred to a date only six weeks removed from that for which estimates were required, viz., the middle of the year 1915. No doubt this does not form a perfect record as it is known that a number of persons escaped registration. From investigations however, which have been made in another connection, it appears that the defects in the register taken as a whole are not on such a scale as to affect seriously the estimates of population based upon it. By the n ethod described below it was possible to derive from these returns estimates of the civil population only of each administrative area on August 15th. No attempt has been made to increase these by allowance for members of the fighting forces because, apart altogether from the difficulty of ascertaining the average military population of each district during the year, experience has shown that under present circumstances only civilian deaths can be tabulated for local areas. If military deaths were to be included, they would have either to be debited to the area in which they occurred, a course which would render the death-rates of districts containing military hospitals meaningless, or to the area of residence. An attempt to pursue the latter course has had to be abandoned owing to military authorities having been unable to furnish to the registrars the necessary information. It has been found necessary therefore to limit the tabulation of deaths by local areas to deaths of civilians, and under these circumstances the civilian population is obviously the proper one to use for the calculation of death-rates. An additional advantage in the use of National Register populations is that these consist of habitual residents in each locality and not merely of the persons who happened to be present therein on a certain date. The deaths tabulated from the year 1911 onwards are also of those of habitual residents only, and therefore the use hitherto of populations which in certain cases included very large institutional elements chiefly composed of non-residents introduced in these cases serious errors into the rates calculated from them, as pointed out in the Registrar General's Annual 7 Reports. This source of error now of course disappears for the time being, and in such districts an unavoidable break in the continuity of the previously misleading rates will result. In any case, however, the maintenance of continuity is, under present circumstances, obviously impossible, and it is felt that the present estimates will furnish death-rates calculated to indicate as nearly as may be the health conditions of the civil population. The method by which the estimates of civil population have been derived from the National Register returns may now be described. The ratio of the total population less the males aged 15-65 years to the number of females aged 15 to 65 years at the date of the census was calculated for each administrative area, and this ratio was applied to the number of females on the National Register ; the resulting product plus the number of males aged 15 to 65 years on the National Register was taken to be the number of the civil population of the district. A small adjustment was necessary in order to make the sum of the estimates for the several districts equal to the estimate for the Country as a whole made on the same basis. Further the population in institutions was not registered and this (taken to be the same in the aggregate for England and Wales as at census date), together with a number of no fixed abode, were distributed evenly over the whole Country. These two adjustments raised the original estimates by about one per cent. The question of the population to be used for the calculation of birth rates has also required consideration. The births legistered are not only those of the children of civilians, and the estimates of the civil population therefore form an unsuitable basis for the calculation of birth-rates. It is impossible to frame any estimate that would give reliable birth-rates, and it is suggested, therefore, that the birth-rates for 1915 be based upon the existing estimates of total population for 1914. These will sometimes be seriously in error owing to extensive migration having occurred. Although in such cases the Registrar General does not possess the local information necessary for applying any correction, it is not suggested 8 that this fact need preclude medical officers of health from making use of their opportunities in this direction. Difficulties, which will probably prove insoluble, remain as to estimation of populations in sex and age groups and the standardising factors dependent upon them. Moreover, the present method of estimation will obviously not apply to 1916 or subsequent years, unless the National Register is effectively kept up to date or further enumeration made. Nothing can at present be decided as to these matters. I have based all the rates upon the figure supplied by the Registrar General. For this reason the birth-rate will appear higher than it actually is, but if one figure be used to calculate the birthrate and another figure for other purposes, confusion would arise. Based upon the lower figure there has been a decrease in the birth-rate. 1,390 births were registered in the district and 24 birth returns were received from outside districts. Though the figures for the whole year do not show a very marked decrease, when they are analysed it is seen that the result for the second half of the year is more than disappointing. The births registered in the district during the four quarters numbered 429, 385, 314 and 263 respectively. There were 724 male births and 690 female. 83 infants were registered as having been born out of wedlock. In the face of a lower birth-rate, a higher infantile mortality is not only disappointing, but serious. It is the highest infantile mortality recorded in the district since 1911, and a comparison with that year would be entirely misleading. In 1911, we experienced a very hot and dry summer, and naturally, there was a high mortality from summer diarrhoea. Last year, we experienced the highest mortality in the first quarter, the figures for the four quarters being 55, 39, 31, and 21 respectively. 9 The notifications of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria are lower than in 1914, but the mortality from both was higher. There was no death from Enteric Fever. There was an extensive outbreak of Measles in the early part of the year, and 26 deaths occurred from the disease. Although the incidence of Infectious disease was light, the number of cases treated in the Hospital remained high. Outside cases from Hanwell and Wembley were treated and Military cases from the camp at Park Royal were admitted. Your obedient servant, D. J. THOMAS. 10 TABLE 1.

KINCH, Chief Sanitary Inspector. Report ON THE Medical Inspection of Schools For the Year 1915. 22 The Urban district Council of Acton. To the Chairman and Members of the Education Committer Ladies and Gentlemen, The Report this year is as short as possible, and consists chiefly of tables of statistics. The usual routine work has been carried out, and the inspection of children reaching the age of eight years has been undertaken as well. A summary of Table 3 shows that out of every hundred children examined at the routine inspection : 17 have nits in the head. 6 are undernourished. 6 are badly clothed. 6 are dirty in clothing or person. 13 are mouthbreathers, of whom 6 require operation. 70 have bad teeth. 1 has definite heart disease. 2 have definite lung disease. 9 have sight bad enough to require treatment. 2 squint. 4 are deaf. We have frequently been asked what the effect of the war is on the nutrition and condition of the children. Comparing the figures with last year, the number of under" nourished children has fallen from 13 to 6, the number of badly clothed children has fallen from 10 to 6, but the number of children who are dirty or who have nits is unchanged. This bears out the general impression given by the Schools—that the children are on the whole rather better fed and clothed, but no cleaner. 23 During the year the Dentist attended two afternoons a week, instead of one as before. This enabled him to deal with the new 6—8 year olds in the schools under treatment, and to re-examine and treat the old cases. Only one new school could be taken into the scheme. The great need of treatment and the effect of it can be seen from the following figures:— 8 year olds examined at Rothschild Schools—No Dental treatment:— Percentage of children with no decayed teeth 21.4% Average number of decayed teeth per child 3.3% 8 year olds examined at Priory Schools—Dental Treatment two years:— Percentage of children with no decayed teeth 88.9 % Average number of decayed teeth per child 3% There could be no better argument for an extension of the Dental Treatment to every school. Free Meals. During the year the numbers attending the Feeding Centre fell off rapidly. Arrangements were made by which children not eligible for free meals could buy dinners for 2d., as it was thought that in many cases the children should be able to get hot and suitable meals, even though there was no poverty at home. But in spite of this the numbers fell to 14, and on October 9th, the Feeding Centre was closed, and the remaining children were fed at the Cookery Centres. The figures are given in a later Table. Mentally Defective and Backward Children. In April, 1915, three classes were started for Mentally Defective and backward children. 53 children were recommended for the Special School, 40 as mentally defective, 13 as very backward for further observation 24 Some have since left the area, and one child was transferred to us from the L.C.C. At present there are 48 on the register in the Special School. The Tables which follow gives a summary of the work done. With the permission of the Committee the Assistant Medical Officer has been attending at Hospitals and Mothers' Welcomes, which are in need of help because of the shortage of doctors. That this has been possible without giving up any of the routine work is due to the loyal co-operation of the whole staff, and to the method and energy of the clerks of the Medical Department.
