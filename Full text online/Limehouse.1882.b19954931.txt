The Creek was accordingly cleansed, and the amount paid by the Board in respect of the same amounted to £38 16s. 6d. IMPROVEMENTS. The old Rope Ground under the Bridge in Glamis Road, Shadwell, having become disused, an opportunity arose for the removal of the Bridge, and the question was referred to the Shadwell Committee for consideration. The owner (Mr. Horner) having objected to the removal, no further action was taken. The Board of Works for the Poplar District, addressed a Communication to the Board on the subject of the extension of Bridge Road, Poplar, to the West India Dock Road, Limehouse, asking this Board to co-operate with them in endeavouring to have the suggested improvements carried out as a Metropolitan Improvement. The matter is now under the consideration of a joint Committee consisting of certain Members of the two Boards. The London and County Banking Company, having purchased the house and premises in the East India Dock Road, at the east corner of Birchfield Street, partly in the District of Poplar and partly in Limehouse, for the purpose of erecting a Branch Bank, the subject was referred to the Surveyor, with instructions to negociate with the Company and the other owners of property on the east side of the street in conjunction with the Poplar District Board as to the terms upon which the necessary land could be acquired for widening the street to 30 feet. The negociations are still pending. CAB RADIUS. Five Members of the Board have been appointed to attend a Meeting of Delegates, from several of the District Boards and Vestries, at the Mansion House, on the 13th March, 1883, to discuss the question of altering the Cab Radius, and the Meeting was adjourned until 3rd April. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS. The Metropolitan Board of Works have made orders for re-numbering the houses in Ropemaker's Fields, Oak Lane and Nightingale Lane, Limehouse, and also for abolishing the subsidiary names of Rickman's Rents, Linton Place, and Lockside, and re-naming the whole "Lockside," and for re-numbering the houses therein, also for re-numbering the houses in Thomas Street, Limehouse, and Green Street, Ratcliff. MAKING UP AND PAVING STREETS. The works in connection with the making up, paving, draining and channelling of Lee Street and Kirk's Place Limehouse, have been carried out; the total cost of the works being as follows, viz:— Lee Street £367 5 2 Kirk's Place 126 0 11 The necessary orders have been made upon the owners of houses and land in such Streets for payment of the apportioned expenses. SURPLUS LANDS, WAPPING. Application having been made to the Board to purchase part of the surplus lands at Wapping, the question of the disposal of the same was referred to the Wapping Committee who recommended that advertisements should be issued inviting Tenders for the purchase of such lands. The matter is still under the consideration of the Committee. ARTISANS' AND LABORERS' DWELLINGS-BROOK STREET SCHEME. The Medical Officer of Health having made an Official Representation of the unhealthy area comprising Harris' Court, Blue Anchor Alley and other Courts adjoining, a Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works made an inspection of the area, and that Board determined to include the same in a Scheme under the Artisans' and Laborers' Dwellings' Act. A copy of the Scheme, with a plan of the area, was deposited at the Offices of this Board, and on the 8th March, 1883, Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols, having been duly appointed in that behalf, held an enquiry at the District Board Offices in White Horse Street, as to the Official Representation made by the Medical Officer of Health, as to the area to which the enquiry related being unhealthy, and as to the sufficiency of the Scheme provided for its improvement by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and any local objections which might be made thereto. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notices having been received by this Board and also by the Whitechapel Board, the Poplar Board, and the Vestries of St. George in the East and Mile End Old Town from the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company of their intention to apply to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order to authorise them to supply Electricity for public and private purposes in this and the adjoining Districts, meetings of the Clerks and Surveyors of the various Districts which would be effected by the Provisional Order were held at the Office of the Whitechapel District Board, and there being many objections to the form of the proposed Order and it being necessary to comply with the Rules of the Board of Trade that such objections should be stated in detail, it was considered advisable that the Provisional Order should be sent in amended in the same form by all the Districts affected, and with this view Messrs. Dyson & Son, Parliamentary Agents, were instructed to act on behalf of the several Districts, and the objections to the Order and the suggested amendments therein were subsequently deposited with the Board of Trade and the Solicitors for the Promoters. EAST LONDON TRAMWAYS. A Notice was received from the East London Tramways Company of their intention to apply to Parliament in the ensuing Session for leave to bring in a Bill for the construction of certain Tramways in West India Dock Road and other places in this and the adjoining District of Poplar. The Notice was referred to the Works and Survey Committee for consideration, and they recommended the Board for certain reasons, to refuse its assent to the scheme of the promoters, and the Company subsequently withdrew from the Bill so much of the proposed line as was situate in the Limehouse District. POPLAR & CANNING TOWN RAILWAY. A Notice was received from the promoters of the Poplar and Canning Town Railway of their intention to apply to Parliament for leave to bring in a Bill for the construction of a Eailway from Limehouse, near the West India Dock Station, to Canning Town. The scheme was subsequently withdrawn. COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH SIDES OF THE THAMES BELOW LONDON BRIDCE. This subject has attracted great public interest especially in the east and south parts of the Metropolis. An influential Committee for promoting vehicular communications between the north and south of the Thames east of London Bridge, and consisting of merchants and gentlemen interested in manufactures, the several Docks, &c., was formed under the presidency of C. T. Ritchie, Esq., M.P. Many meetings were held in the City at which important resolutions were passed. In June, 1882, the Board passed the following resolution:— "That this Board is of opinion that the erection of a Bridge "500 yards east of London Bridge as contemplated by the City "Authorities will only partially meet the necessities and require"ments of the eastern portion of the Metropolis north and south "of the Thames, and moreover this Board is also further of opinion "that it is undesirable that any compact should be entered into “with the City Authorities and the Metropolitan Board of "Works in providing for the same." In July, 1882, a Conference of Delegates from various Boards and Vestries of the Metropolis, including representatives from this District, was held at the Cannon Street Hotel on the subject, and the following Resolutions were passed:— "That means of free communications for vehicles and pedes"trians between north and south of the Thames at points below "London Bridge have become an absolute necessity in the in"terests of the vast population and trading community in the "Metropolitan area eastward of such Bridge. "That without pre-judging the question of the necessity for a "Bridge East of London Bridge it is desirable that permanent com"munications by way of Tunnel or Tunnels should be provided. "That pending the construction of any permanent Works and "to provide the necessary communication at the earliest possible "moment, it is extremely desirable that two or more Steam Floating "Bridges should be established at various parts of the river as a "temporary measure." In October, 1882, I reported that I had had an interview with the Engineer of the Surrey Commercial Docks, and in consequence of the serious objections and difficulties that would arise if any part of the proposed Tunnel from Shadwell to Rotherhithe passed through the Docks, I prepared an amended scheme so as to avoid any interference with the Docks. The plan was approved by the Board and a copy sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works. Other meetings of Delegates were held at various places at which Resolutions were passed urging the Metropolitan Board of Works to give consideration to this matter without loss of time. FISH MARKET ACCOMMODATION FOR THE METROPOLIS. The Bill for the construction of a Fish Market at Shadwell was referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons (Mr. W. H. Gladstone, Chairman). The necessary Clauses had been agreed with the Promoters for the protection of the Limehouse District. The Bill was before the Committee eight days (from the 15th to the 24th March, 1882), in consequence of the active tion of the Corporation of the City of London. The preamble was declared to be proved, and the Bill was read a third time on the 17th April. The Board appointed a Special Committee to watch the Bill and arrange for public meetings to be held in support thereof. A public meeting was held at Shoreditch Town Hall, on the 2nd May, C. T. Ritchie, Esq., M.P., in the Chair, at which Resolutions were passed in favor of the Bill and praying the Corporation not to continue their opposition in the House of Lords. On the 8th May, a public meeting was held at the Bow and Bromley Institute, James Bryce, Esq., M.P., in the Chair, at which similar Resolutions were passed. Petitions were drawn up in accordance with the Resolutions and presented by Mr. Ritchie, accompanied by a large and influential Deputation, to the Court of Common Council. The Motion to continue the opposition was carried in the Court by a majority of one, but a Resolution to ask compensation for loss of Tolls at Billingsgate in the event of the Bill being passed, was lost by a large majority. The Bill was read a second time in the House of Lords on May 2nd, and referred to a Select Committee, who sat on the 15th, 16th, 19th, and 20th June, when the Chairman stated that the preamble of the Bill was proved, but that if the Corporation wished to bring forward a clause giving the Corporation compulsory power of purchase of the new Market the Committee would be willing to consider it. In the result two clauses were inserted in the Bill—one giving full compensation to the Corporation for all loss and injury which they might sustain by reason of the establishment and continuance of the Market at Shadwell, and the other giving power to the Corporation within six months after the passing of the Act, upon payment of the taxed costs incurred by the Promoters in obtaining the same, to have transferred to them all the powers of the Act. The Bill was read a third time and passed on June 29 th. The Bill was sent down to the House of Commons, and on Monday, the 10th July, the Lords' Amendments thereto were taken into consideration, Mr. Ritchie having previously given notice to move "to disagree with Clauses 54a and 54b added by the Lords." His motion was supported by speeches from the Home Secretary, the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Chairman of the Committee of the House of Commons before whom the Bill originally came, (Mr. W. H. Gladstone) the late Chairman of Ways and Means, (Mr. Raikes) and by Mr. Bryce. The Lords' Amendments were disagreed to by the House of Commons without a division. On Friday, July 14th, the Bill again came before the House of Lords, for the consideration of the amendments to which the House of Commons had disagreed. In the House of Lords the Earl of Mar and Kellie (who was on the Select Committee to whom the Bill had been referred), moved "That the Lords do insist upon the amendments to which the Commons have disagreed," and he was supported by Lord Wentworth (another member of the Select Committee), and by the Earl de la Warr. His Motion was opposed by the Earl of Camperdown, the Duke of Leinster (who was Chairman of the Select Committee), and the Earl of Shaftesbury, and their Lordships agreed without a division not to insist on the amendments and the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 24th July. There were seventeen petitions from the Vestries and Local Authorities in the Metropolis, including the Metropolitan Board of Works, presented to the House of Commons, praying that House would not agree to the Clauses inserted by the House of Lords. After the Autumn recess the Company was formed and a prospectus issued, for raising the capital required for the establishment of the Market under the Act of Parliament. In several respects the prospectus was unsatisfactory and not sufficiently defined as to financial arrangements, and although a largo sum was subscribed in the East of London, the public in general did not give any support to the undertaking. In consequence the Deposit money was returned to the subscribers in full, and active steps are being taken for the purpose of obtaining the capital privately, so as to ensure the establishment of the Market at the earliest possible period. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1882. During that period there were registered in the District 2,275 births, 1,356 deaths, and 468 marriages. Of the births 1,165 were male, and 1,110 female children; 1,295 were registered in Limehouse, 590 in Ratcliff, and 391 in Shadwell and Wapping, thus 2 giving an annual birth rate to these parishes of 40, 36 and 37 per 1,000 population respectively. Of the deaths 688 were of males, and 668 of females; 656 were registered in Limehouse, 331 in Ratcliff, and 369 in Shadwell and Wapping, giving an annual death rate of 20.4, 20.5, and 35.5 to these parishes respectively; but inasmuch as the East London Children's Hospital wherein 124 deaths of persons resident outside the District, and 32 of persons resident in Limehouse and Wapping were registered, is situated in Shadwell a deduction of these 156 deaths must be made. This will reduce the number of deaths in Shadwell and Wapping to 213, and give a death rate to these parishes of 20.5 per 1,000 per annum. It will thus be seen that the death rates of the parishes forming your District are almost identical. To estimate the deaths in the District we must deduct the 124 deaths above alluded to from the 1,356 deaths registered, and add to the remainder our share of deaths which occurred in the Public Institutions of London. That number this year amounts to 237. Therefore we have 1,356 — 124 — 1,232 + 237 = 1,469, which represents the total mortality of your District for the year 1882. Both Births and Deaths were in excess of, and Marriages below, the average of the last ten years. The Birth rate was 38.8 per 1,000 population, the average of the last ten years being 36 per 1,000. The Death rate was 25 per 1,000 population, the average of the last ten years being 23.9 per 1,000. The Birth rate of London was 34.3, and the death rate 21. 4 per 1,000 population. 3 No less than 47 per cent. of the total deaths were those of children under five years of age—this accords pretty closely with the average of the last ten years. In London 41 per cent. of the total deaths were those of children under five years of age. From the Seven principal Zymotic Diseases, viz., Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever and Diarrhoea, 283 deaths were registered, being equivalent to a death rate of 4.8 per 1,000 living. Pulmonary Diseases (other than Phthisis) destroyed a similar number. Tubercular Diseases were fatal to 144 persons, and produced a death rate of 2.4 per 1,000. From Wasting Diseases of Infants 111 deaths were registered, being equal to a death rate of 1.9 per 1,000. The Convulsive Diseases of Infants destroyed 122, and produced a death rate of 2 per 1,000. Small Pox.-Seventeen deaths were registered from this disease during the year. Of this number 8 occurred in the district, and 9 in the Hospitals. The disease was mueh less prevalent than during the preceding year, 86 cases only being reported to me, against 246 in 1881. Measles.—Twenty-five deaths were registered from this disease. It was considerably less fatal than since 1875, when only 20 deaths were registered. 4 Scarlet Fever —Sixty-five deaths occurred from this disease, being 17 above the average of the last ten years. This number (65) has only been exceeded three times during that period, viz., in 1874, 1879, and 1880, when 105, 71, and 112, deaths were registered respectively. Of these 65 deaths 59 occurred in the District, and 6 in the Hospitals. One hundred and ninety cases were reported to me, of which number 21 occurred in the East London Hospital for Children. This Hospital possesses no disinfecting apparatus. It appears to me however that such an apparatus would be a singularly appropriate addition to an institution devoted to the treatment of children's diseases. Diphtheria.—Four deaths were registered from this disease, being rather below the ten years average. Whooping Cough caused 113 deaths. It was more fatal than in any of the last ten years, and caused a mortality more than double the average of that period. Fever (Typhus, Enteric, and Simple Continued) caused 17 deaths. Of these 2 were due to Typhus, and occurred in Hospital, 14 to Enteric, of which number 6 occurred in Hospital, and 8 in the District, and one to Simple Continued Fever, which took place in the District. The annual average of the last ten years was 19.9. Diarrhcea.—To this disease there were attributed 42 deaths, being 20 below the ten years average. 5 The total number of deaths due to Diseases of a Zymotic Character was 310. One hundred and seventy-seven deaths were registered from Constitutional Diseases, and included 21 from Cancer, 41 from Tabes, and 96 from Phthisis. Local Diseases caused 537 deaths among which were 43 from Inflammatory Affections of the Brain, 26 from Apoplexy, 65 from Convulsions, 40 from Heart Disease, 179 from Bronchitis, and 76 from Pneumonia. Diseases connected with Development caused 135 deaths, and included 17 from Premature Birth, 17 from Teething, 13 from Childbirth, 29 from Old Age, and 53 from Atrophy and Debility. Seventy-three deaths were attributed to Violence, and included 10 from Fractures or Contusions, 6 from Burns or Scalds, 2 from Poison, 32 from Drowning, 17 from Suffocation. Five persons committed Suicide. In reviewing these facts and figures one is struck by the discrepancy which exists between the death rate of London and that of your District. In the one case there is a death rate of but 21.4 per 1,000, and in the other the death rate amounts to 25 per 1,000. On the other hand the birth rate of your District is higher than that of London, being in the one case 38.8, and in the other 34.3 ; these figures, together with the fact that in your District 6 the deaths of children under 5 years amounts to 47 per cent. of the total mortality while in London it amounts to but 41 per cent., point to an excessive infant mortality. In a district like that over which you possess sanitary jurisdiction, such a state of things though deplorable is not to be wondered at. Yours is essentially a labouring population and therefore subject to vicissitudes to which their more fortunate brethren are strangers: when work is slack food is scarce among them and the little ones are the first to feel it— the mother has to add her mite towards the sustenance of the family, and this means absence from and neglect of it—again, as the family grows larger the means of keeping it become smaller. More economical lodgings are sought and overcrowding becomes inevitable. Under such circumstances as these, what wonder that children should sicken and die, or that when infectious disease breaks out among them that it should spread. This leads me naturally to the consideration of the subject of compulsory notification of infectious disease. It is a fact that of the number of cases of Scarlet fever which came to my knowledge last year about one-third were reported to me as deaths, that is to say, the disease had time to sow its seeds far and wide before its existence became known to the Sanitary Authority. To eradicate infectious disease or even stem its tide under such circumstances becomes well-nigh impossible; everything depends upon early notification of every case to the constituted authority; so far as regards the pauper illness of the district this early notification already exists with much benefit to the community, but as regards private illness, generally, the first intimation I receive of its existence is through the Registrar of Deaths; sometimes, but very rarely do I receive information from private medical practitioners, and occasionally when neighbours are frightened I hear of a case from them. Cases of infectious disease are also met with in the course of our sanitary inspections; these are the principal sources of my 7 mation, and I think your Board will admit that they are not by any means equal to the importance of the subject. Towards the end of 1881 a Royal Commission was appointed to enquire respecting Smallpox and Fever Hospitals in the Metropolis. The Commissioners held thirty-seven meetings, and examined fortyeight witnesses, comprising physicians of the highest eminence, the secretary, and several medical inspectors of the Local Government Board, and others connected with sanitary and poor law administration. The enquiry was most exhaustive, and touched upon among other matters this question of the Compulsory Notification of infectious diseases, and I do not think I can do better than quote from the practical recommendations of the Commission on this and kindred subjects. At page XXXI. of the Report are these words:— "We are of opinion that the provision of Hospital accommodation for persons suffering from infectious disease in the Metropolitan Districts should be entirely disconnected from the administration of the poor law and treated as part of the Sanitary arrangements of the Metropolis. We think that the conduct of the Hospitals cannot be better placed than under the management of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with such changes in their mode of election as shall give the Sanitary Authorities of London, that is to say, the Vestries, District Boards, and Commissioners of Sewers at least an equal influence with the Guardians of the poor in the choice of the elective members of the Board. We think that every person suffering from an infectious disease or those in charge of him, or if these neglect their duty, the occupier of the house in which the sick person is residing, or if he is a pauper, his Medical attenclent should be required by law to notify the nature of the disease to the Medical Officer of Health so soon as they or any of them are aware of it; and that in the case of non-paupers the Medical attendant should, if it is inexpedient to impose any further 8 gation on him, be similarly required by law to furnish the sick person, or those in charge of him, with a certificate of the nature of the disease to be by them communicated to the Medical Officer of Health. On every certificate so commnnicated a small fee should be paid to the Medical man who signed it. "If the Medical officer after receiving such certificate is satisfied that the patient can and will be properly isolated, and requisite means of disinfection adopted, the matter will proceed no further. "If he is not so satisfied, and if the sick person is not too ill to be removed he will notify the case to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board, who will thereupon be at once and entirely charged with the patient till his complete recovery, and in particular will be empowered to remove him at once to one of their Hospitals. So far no distinction should be made between paupers and non-paupers who cannot be isolated. But within the Hospital those who are desirous of being placed in separate wards should be allowed such accommodation on paying for it. In case of ordinary accommodation, it appears to us a question whether payment should be claimed even from those who can make payment without difficulty. "If the sick person cannot be removed or isolated by those about him, the Medical officer will be bound to take all necessary steps for his isolation, and generally for the protection of the neighbourhood, with power to clear the house of its inmates. In all cases he will be bound to disinfect the house, and in the case of houses invaded by Smallpox should be empowered to require the re-vaccination of all occupants who are not otherwise protected." These recommendations appear to me of an eminently practical character, and calculated to check to an extent hitherto unknown in the Metropolis the spread of infectious disease. 9 Sanitary Work. For a detailed account of the Sanitary work performed in the District during the year see Table VI. in the Appendix. As regards those matters which came under my own personal observation I have reported to the Board at their fortnightly meetings. They were generally connected either with complaint of nuisance or with occurrence of disease and among them were the following:— In January the existence of Typhus Fever, in James Place, Ratcliff, Juniper Street, Shad well, and Baroda Place, in the same parish came to my knowledge; the sufferers were removed by the Guardian's officers to the Hospital, the usual precautions were taken against the spread of the disease, and no further case arose therefrom. The death rate of the District was considerably augmented in February by the number of deaths which occurred from diseases of the breathing organs. It exceeded considerably any death rate reported by me to your Board, and in fact was very nearly double the average death rate. The Mortality from Whooping Cough and Bronchitis was exceptional, 50 per cent. of the total mortality having been due to these diseases. This high rate of mortality was due chiefly, if not solely, to the prevalence of the choking fogs experienced in London at that time. The death rate of the District rose to 44 per 1,000, and that of London to 35 per 1,000 population. Lime Kiln Dock came under my notice early in the year, and I reported to your Board concerning its condition on 22nd March. 10 I found it in an unsanitary condition, the receptacle of all kinds of refuse, which, at low Avater, was deposited upon the mud. After some correspondence with the owners of the abutting premises and the Thames Conservancy Board the dock was cleared out. In consequence of a communication from the Paddington Vestry on the subject of the more speedy removal to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board of persons suffering from infectious diseases the matter came under the consideration of your Board. It was thought, however, that no unnecessary delay had occurred under the system then in operation, and no action except acknowledging the communication was taken. It having come to my knowledge that a person had pawned bedding, &c., which had been exposed to the infection of Smallpox and had not been disinfected, it became my duty to cause the infected articles to be disinfected, and to report the circumstances to your Board. The person had rendered herself liable to proceedings under the 38th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, but inasmuch as she had offended unwittingly your Board was satisfied with cautioning her against a re-commission of the offence. A thorough inspection of the Bakehouses in the District was made, and the result reported to you on May 3rd. Under the Bakehouses' Regulation Act, 1863, your Board was the Sanitary Authority, but that Act having been repealed by the 41 and 42 Vict., c. 16 Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, your Board had no power to inspect these premises, except under the provisions of the Nuisances Removal Act. The cause of the inspection was a letter in the public press from a factory inspector describing a 11 horrible condition of things as existing in the London Bakehouses. The points to which attention was particularly directed in my inspection were the situation of the Bakehouse, the drainage and closet arrangement of the premises, the ventilation of the Bakehouse, the number of hands employed, and the general cleanliness of the premises or otherwise. Fifty-four Bakehouses were inspected ; of these 24 were situated in the basement, and 30 in the rear of dwelling houses. In 50 the closets were in the yard, in 2 in the dwelling house, and in 2 in the Bakehouse. In 52 the drainage of the premises was good, and the drains efficiently trapped. In 2 the drains were not trapped. In 51 the ventilation was sufficient, while in 3 it needed improvement. One hundred and six hands were employed. The condition as regards cleanliness of the Bakehouses was satisfactory in 43 instances, while in 11 cleansing was required. There can be no doubt that for the sake of the baker and his family the Bakehouse should be removed from the dwelling house. The placing of a closet in a Bakehouse needs but to be mentioned to be condemned. This arrangement was discovered in only 2 instances, and in each case the Bakehouse was of recent construction, certainly since 1878, when your authority in this matter ceased. On the 11th June a woman who resided at Kensal Green removed her child who was suffering from Scarlatina from the East London Children's Hospital, and carried it through the public street, although she was warned that by so doing she was rendering herself liable to proceedings under the 38th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866. I at once communicated with the Sanitary Authority of the District where she resided, and reported the circumstances to your Board. Messrs. Schofield and White's premises in Turner's Road, 12 Limehouse, came under my notice two or three times. The manufacture of Manure on these premises from trade refuse has been the cause of frequent complaints to your Board. On the 14th June I inspected the place and found refuse from Dye Works, Furriers, Sugar Refiners, Ammonia Works, Coopers' Yards, Docks, Alum Works, and Tan Yards, together with the sweepings of flues and other substances. One large heap especially attracted my attention, a most disagreeable odour being evolved from it. I was informed that the heap in question had been collected from the Docks. It was in fact a collection of all sorts of rubbish, composed in great part of decaying animal and vegetable matter. A notice was served upon Messrs. Schofield and White to remove this offensive heap at once, which was complied with. In July, I received notice of a serious outbreak of Scarlatina in the District; during the fortnight ended July 12th no less than 21 cases were reported to me; of these 7 were returned as deaths, 7 were removed to Hospital, and 7 remained under treatment in the District. In the following fortnight again 21 cases were reported—of these eight were removed to Hospital, 6 were returned as deaths, and 7 remained under treatment in the District; from this time to the end of the year Scarlet Fever was more or less prevalent in the District, notwithstanding the constant efforts of your Sanitary staff to dislodge it. With a systematic notification of infectious disease I do not think I should have to record this fact. In October I received a letter from the Secretary of the London Fever Hospital, stating that in consequence of the great demands made upon their accommodation for patients suffering 13 from Scarlatina, the Hospital authorities had decided that no new cases should be received on the orders of Vestries. I mention this circumstance in order to point out to your Board the extremely precarious nature of the extent of Hospital accommodation for non-pauper patients which at present exists in the Metropolis. On the 11th of the same month I reported to your Board that a Fish Manure Factory had been established on Gould's Hill, Shadwell, contrary to the provisions of the Slaughter Houses (Metropolis) Act, 1874. Your Board thereupon directed a communication to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board (the authority under the Act) upon the subject, but on the 20th October, the nuisance not having been abated I attended at the Thames Police Court in support of a summons taken out by the Inspector of Nuisances for No. 2 District, against the proprietor of the premises. The Magistrate made an order to abate the nuisance complained of forthwith and against the recurrence of the same. The nuisance was abated within a few hours and the offensive material removed with as little delay as possible, Chancery Court and Chancery Place, Shadwell, came under my notice on two or three occasions during the year. The inhabitants of these Courts are distinguished by a total disregard of sanitary laws and decent behaviour. Nothing can keep these places in order but frequent visitations of the Sanitary Inspector. Towards the end of the year there were signs that a representation made by me in 1877 to the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the Artisans' Dwellings' Acts, 1875-82, regarding a certain area 14 in Brook Street, Ratcliff, was about to be dealt with. It is a great satisfaction to me to report that my representation received the favourable consideration of that Board; that the scheme put forward by the Metropolitan Board received the approval of the Secretary of State, and that the area will be dealt with under the provisions of the before mentioned Acts. The total cost of the improvement is estimated at about £18,000. In December in consequence of a communication from the City Solicitor, I was led to make several examinations of the condition, as regards sewage pollution, of that portion of the River Thames which is included within the boundaries of your District. The evidence of such pollution was much less then I had anticipated and pointed to the River in this portion of it receiving as much pollution from the West as from the East. The condition of the stream within your boundaries was. not such as to effect the public health, and an examination of the records of Zymotic diseases in the District during the last three years confirmed this view. Cow and Slaughter Houses. These structures were inspected by me before the day of licensing the same, and the defects discovered having been remedied, licenses were granted to those named in the list of licensees in the Appendix. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air during the year was 49.7° F.; the mean of the 1st quarter having been 42.7°, of the 2nd 53°, of the 3rd 58.1°, and of the 4th 44.8°. The mean height of 15 the Barometer was 29.758 inches. The rain fall amounted to 25.16 inches; 3.63 inches having fallen during the 1st quarter; 6.13 inches daring the 2nd; 6.01 inches in the 3rd; and 9.39 inches in the 4th. On 48 days the Wind was from the North, on 55 from the East, on 110 from the South, and on 152 from the West. Rain fell on 179 days. Water Supply. The Water drawn from the Lea (the source of the East London Water supply), was throughout the year of better average quality than that from the Thames ; the New River Company's supply being in nearly every case superior to that of any Company drawing from the Thames. The East London Company's supply although on two occasions superior to that of the New River Company, usually ranked with the better samples of Thames Water. A great improvement might be effected in the filtration of the River Waters if, to the sand already employed, an additional filter bed of spongy iron were added. The process of filtration through spongy iron has already been adopted on a large scale in Belgium with marked success. The Water of the New River and East London Companies was only on one occasion slightly turbid. (Vide Professor Frankland's Report). Sale of Food and Drugs' Act. Eighty-eight samples of Food and Drugs were examined at the Board's Laboratory. Of these 29 were Milks, of which 4 were adulterated with varying proportions of water. Eleven were Coffees, of which 1 was adulterated with 50°/° of Chicory. Six were Butters, of which only one was genuine; the adulteration consisted in 16 each case of foreign fat, in proportions varying from 28 per cent. to 83 per cent.; the sellers were convicted and fined in sums varying from 10/- to £5. The remaining samples consisting of Tea, Bread, Quinine, Cocoa, Mustard, Tincture of Rhubarb, Tincture of Bark, Sweet Spirits of Nitre, Tincture of Orange Peel, Pepper, Arrowroot, Flour, and Vinegar were unadulterated. In concluding this Report, I feel it due to the Inspectors to state that they have carried out my instructions and performed their duties to my entire satisfaction.
