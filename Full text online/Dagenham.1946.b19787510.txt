C 4411(1) DAGENHAM DAG 20 * | ft * BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM INTERIM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1946 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.),D.P.H. BOROUGH OF DAGENHAM INTERIM ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1946 CECIL HERINGTON, M.D. (Lond.),D.P.H. 3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Dagenham. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith my report for the year 1946, which has been drawn-up in accordance with the requirements of Articles 6(3) and 17(5) of the Sanitary Officers (Outside London) Regulations, 1935, as modified by Circular 13/47 of the Ministry of Health dated 13th March, 1947. This circular again states that the report should be an interim one. The estimated population for mid-1946 is given as 106,530. The Registrar-General, however, in his latest quarterly return estimates the civilian population at 110,300. To these should be added the unascertainable number of those serving in the Forces. The upward trend of the population since the cessation of hostilities is thus being maintained. It will be recalled that before the war each official estimate of population year by year was in excess of that previously shown. One other gratifying fact is the low record infant mortality rate which is 31.09 per thousand live births. This figure compares with 43 for England and Wales as a whole and 46 for the 126 County Boroughs and Great Towns including London. In 1928 the corresponding figure for Dagenham was 73.1 and with minor fluctuations it has tended to decrease. The previous low record of 39.16 occurred in 1944. The infant mortality rate is usually accepted as the index of the health of the population as a whole. The other vital statistics shown in the body of the report are satisfactory including the maternal mortality rate which is .82 per thousand total births. It is not so many years ago that a maternal mortality rate of four per thousand was regarded with complacency. BIRTH RATE. The total births numbered 2,380 compared with 1,847 for the previous year. The birth rate per thousand of the resident population is 22.34 compared with 19.54 for 1945. This further substantial rise has strained to the utmost the facilities offered by this department. Medical Officers, Health Visitors, Midwives and Clerical Staff have all been working at high pressure to cope with the rapid increase. The Committee has already given consideration to supplementing the health services in order to cope with the demand. It is scarcely necessary to point out that beyond a certain point it is not possible to deal satisfactorily with large numbers at Ante-Natal and Infant Welfare Clinics. Adverting to Midwives, it is recommended by the Rushcliffe Committee that the number of cases to be attended by a domiciliary midwife without a pupil should not exceed 66 per year. Reference to the table on "Domiciliary Midwifery Services" later in the report will show that our ten Municipal Midwives undertook 818 cases, including miscarriages. This number at the rate of 66 per year 4 represents the work of 12.4 midwives. There is no evidence at the time of writing this report that there is likely to be a reduction in the number of births. The Council has agreed to the appointment of an additional midwife for holiday relief duty and every endeavour is being made to fill this post. INSTITUTIONAL MIDWIFERY. Owing to lack of hospital accommodation the majority of confinements take place in the patients' homes. In cases, however, where medical reasons and housing conditions so indicate, patients are admitted either to Oldchurch County Hospital or the East End Maternity Hospital. The latter, however, owing to shortage of nursing staff has been compelled to restrict the numbers they will admit from Dagenham. Oldchurch County Hospital is in a similar position, but I am pleased to take this opportunity of expressing appreciation for the most ready assistance and co-operation which have at all times been received from the Medical Superintendent and his staff, who always use their best endeavours to overcome their difficulties, which they invariably succeed in doing to the benefit of the Dagenham mothers. GAS AND AIR ANALGESIA. The provision of gas and air analgesia for domiciliary confinements continues to be popular. On 305 occasions during the year this appliance was used, compared with 237 in the previous year. There is still a certain amount of prejudice against this form of analgesia, particularly on the part of the older mothers. This prejudice appears to be diminishing and the palliative effect is highly appreciated by those who elect to take advantage of it. Unless there are medical reasons for its contra-indication, all prospective mothers are offered, and encouraged to have, this form of treatment. HOME HELP SERVICE. A full-time Home Help Organiser has been appointed and took up her duties early in the present year. Amongst her duties are the selection of home and domestic helps, the allocation of these helps and the supervision of their work. A further duty is to publicise the service and to address representative meetings of women in order that knowledge of the advantages of the service may be disseminated. At the present time there are 24 helps available for service, four of whom are receiving a retaining fee in return for which they hold themselves ready to undertake duty in any part of the Borough. Up to date, it has been possible to supply a home or domestic help on every occasion where one has been needed. DAY NURSERIES. The three Day Nurseries, viz., Chadwell Heath, Kingsley Hall and Goresbrook, have continued in operation. Demands for places therein have increased to such an extent that the Committee recommended that in order to avoid disappointment it should be made known that priority 5 of admission is given to those mothers who are dependent on their own earnings. There are many such cases, as would be expected after a war which caused the widowhood of many young mothers who are forced to provide for their children. The number of attendances at all the nurseries during 1946 was 30,526. There was no undue prevalence of sickness amongst these children. Special care is directed towards the prevention of intestinal and respiratory infections. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. 13 cases of diphtheria occurred in 1946, of these only three had received preventative inoculation. Two of these cases were mild, one was moderate and all recovered. Diphtheria Immunisation is offered at all the Infant Welfare Sessions and at special periodic immunisation clinics. The low incidence of diphtheria in so large a child population indicates that the rate of protection is very high. The acceptance by all mothers of this facility would reduce the problem of diphtheria in this country to negligible proportions. WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION. The Health Services Committee has given very careful consideration to preventive inoculation against Whooping Cough. The Committee is fully aware that this form of prevention is still in its experimental stage and that no guarantee can be given either to prevent the disease or to mitigate its evil effects should it be contracted. A large volume of research work is now being undertaken by a committee of the Medical Research Council. This research involves widespread and varied experiments; it is not expected, however, that the findings of this committee will be fully collated in the immediate future, but having in mind the ravages caused by Whooping Cough it is earnestly hoped that an effective antigen will soon be made available. In certain cases where the parents are anxious to have this treatment for their children, it is provided, the limitations being fully explained to them. SANITARY INSPECTION. The figures later in the report will show the many and varied duties undertaken by the Sanitary Inspectors. It is very notable that compared with previous years the work undertaken has increased to a remarkable extent. Additional duties have been assumed in connection with the Shops Acts. It will be noted that 986 visits connected with these Acts were paid. Rodent Control has also given rise to a great deal of work, this aspect of the Sanitary Inspector's duties having increased nearly fourfold. It is pleasing to be able to record that maintaining a high standard of sanitation in this district has been possible without having to resort to court action. It was necessary, however, to institute legal proceedings under the Food and Drugs Act on one occasion, the result being that the vendors were fined Â£8 and 10s. 6d. costs. The food involved was beef sausage which was deficient in meat content. 6 The many cases of overcrowding are, of course, well known to the department and endeavours to assist those most affected are constantly being made. It is scarcely necessary to point out, however, that the remedy is not entirely in our hands. SCHOOL MEDICAL SERVICE. This Council, being an "Excepted District" under the Education Act, 1944, has now assumed, with some limitations, administrative responsibility for the School Medical Service. The limiting factors are firstly that certain functions are retained by the Essex Education Committee and secondly that staff is not yet fully adequate to deal with the number of children within the Borough. The Medical Officer of Health has been designated "Borough School Medical Officer" and in addition there are three Assistant School Medical Officers who give the greater part of their time to work in Dagenham. It is hoped that in the future it will be possible to integrate more closely the work of the medical and nursing personnel with a view to the same individuals having supervision of children from the ante-natal stage to the school leaving age. At the present time this is not possible owing to the fact that some members of the nursing staff do not possess the qualifications required by the Ministry of Health to enable them to undertake health visiting duties. One of the serious gaps in the organisation is the lack of Dental Officers. The school population which is upwards of 18,000 requires the services of approximately nine wholetime Dental Surgeons. At the moment there is only one, the consequence being that he is only able to touch the fringe of the problem. Dagenham is not, however, peculiar in this respect, as most other authorities are suffering from a shortage of dental personnel. STAFF. I am pleased to say that all members of the Public Health Department have now been released from the Services. I would, however, mention that Mrs. B. E. E. Denny, who has acted as senior clerk in this department since its inception, has now retired. Mrs. Denny saw the department grow from its infancy to its present dimensions. I fell sure the Committee will share with me in wishing Mrs. Denny a long and happy retirement. In conclusion I offer my best thanks to the Chairman and members of the Health Services Committee and to other members of the Council for their help and interest, and also to the members of the staff of this department for their valued assistance and loyal support during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CECIL HERINGTON, Public Health Department, Medical Officer of Health.

The water supply is satisfactory in quality and quantity. Since November, 1938, eight local authorities in the South Essex Waterworks Company's area of supply have carried out a co-ordinated system of sampling. Each authority takes one sample a month for bacteriological examination and one sample every six months for chemical examination in accordance with a rota. The 12 bacteriological and two chemical samples taken from the Company's mains in this Borough were all satisfactory. The water is not liable to have plumbo-solvent properties and no action was called for in respect of any form of contamination. Sanitary Inspection of the District. Report of the Sanitary Inspectors.

The following is a summary of the work carried out during the year:â Number of SCHOOL children immunised without preliminary testing 269 Number of PRE-SCHOOL children immunised without preliminary testing 1,297 Number of SCHOOL children re-Schick tested 1 (This was negative.) Number of SCHOOL children who received a boosting dose 85 Total number of children found to be immune during the year 1 The following table shows details of children who attended for immunisation and were subsequently notified as suffering from Diphtheria, together with observations as to type and ultimate result:â Age. Particulars of Treatment. Notified as Diphtheria. Confirmed. Severity. Results. 7 27.10.42â0.1 c.c. A.P.T. 22.7.46 Yes Moderate Recovered 24.11.42â0.3 c.c. A.P.T. 4 1.1.43â0.1 c.c.

During the year one child, aged 9 years, died from Diphtheria; he had received only part of the preventative treatment against this disease. Scarlet Fever. The number of cases notified was 201, which is a slight decrease of that for the previous year and once more there were no fatal cases. The practice of hospitalising only those cases selected on clinical and/or domestic grounds has been continued with gratifying results. It appears that the tendency throughout the country to nurse uncomplicated cases of Scarlet Fever in their own homes has gained impetus. 22 Tuberculosis. New Cases. Primary Notification.

Notification of Births. 2,338 notifications of live births were received during the year; the majority of these were notified by midwives. Stillbirths. 35 male and 26 female stillbirths were notified, the corresponding figures for registration being 36 and 27. The rate per 1,000 of total population registered was 0.59, the rate for England and Wales being 0.53. The percentage of illegitimate stillbirths to the total was 6.35 compared with a percentage of illegitimate to total births of 5.08. Infant Mortality. 74 infants under one year of age died during the year, giving an infant mortality rate of 31.09 per 1,000 live births, compared with that of 43 for England and Wales and 41 for London. The rate amongst legitimate children was 30.10 while for illegitimate children it was 49.59. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 11 cases of this disease were notified, two of which were treated in hospital; all made complete recoveries. There were 38 cases in which a medical aid notice was sent by a midwife to a medical practitioner on account of some eye condition occurring in a newly-born infant. All these cases were investigated by the Medical Officer of Health and all were visited by a Health Visitor. Maternal Mortality. Two maternal deaths were assigned to this district, which give a maternal mortality rate of 0.82 per thousand births. This is a remarkably low figure ; that for England and Wales for the corresponding period was 1.43 which also is low. Work of Health Visitors. The following table shows the number of visits paid by the Health Visitors during the vear:â (a) To expectant mothers First visits 367 Total visits 587 (b) To children under one year of age First visits 2,248 Total visits 5,048 (c) To children between the ages of one and five years Total visits 11,425 (d) Ineffective visits Total visits 2,811 Grand Total 19,871 24 Supervision of Midwives.
