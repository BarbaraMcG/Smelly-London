July 1960 To: The Chairman and Members of the Feltham Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1959. The vital statistics for 1959 show some degree of variation when compared with the figures for 1958. With an increase both in population and number of inhabited dwellings at approximately 1,000 and 270 respectively, the Birth Rate fell by 1.1 to 15.0 per thousand of population and the Death Rate rose by 1.8 to 13.5 per thousand of population. The numbers of deaths from Coronary Disease and Cancer were practically the same as for 1958 and the chief causes for the increase were (a) deaths due to Pneumonia where the rate was about equal between the sexes and (b) deaths due to heart and circulatory diseases other than coronary diseases—in this instance the rate was higher in females. Two hundred and twenty-four deaths registered were of people over 70 years of age, i.e., 50.3 of the total deaths registered in the district. The infant mortality rate shows an increase of 2.8 to 24.1 per thousand live births. The majority of these deaths occurred in infants less than four weeks old and were due in the main to congenital defects and prematurity. The low Still Birth rate of 11.1 per thousand (Live and Still) Births is no doubt an indication of the value of good and careful ante-natal care resulting in more live births. Unfortunately, however, even though more babies are being born alive, many still die within the first four weeks of life (Neo-Natal Death Rate) and this fact only goes to show that still greater efforts are required to improve to an even higher degree, the Ante-Natal care of mothers and the Post-Natal care of the child. The incidence of infectious disease in the district was slightly higher due in the main to the number of cases of measles (433). This followed the usual pattern being relatively mild—only 15 cases (3 per cent.) requiring admittance to hospital—and mainly affecting infant school children. 3 It is pleasing to note a drop in the numbers of cases of Food Poisoning but unfortunately this is offset by an increased incidence of Dysentery due to Shigella Sonnei. Although mild in character this disease spreads easily from case to case and is of great nuisance value to the public. It can be controlled by drugs but first and foremost prevention in the form of careful personal hygiene is the best way to control this disease. In other words the control of this disease is in the hands of the public themselves. I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and support and also acknowledge with thanks the friendly co-operation of my colleagues in the other departments of the Council. Finally to Mr. F. V. Bell, the Chief Public Health Inspector, and all members of the Health Department, my sincere thanks for their most willing and able assistance during the year. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. CORMACK, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS FOR THE AREA Area and Acreage (Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth) 4,925 acres Population 51,750 Number of inhabited dwellings 14,393 Number of new dwellings erected 304 The product of a penny rate is £3,641 The rateable value is £1,061,988 VITAL STATISTICS LIVE BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 778 388 390 Illegitimate 27 15 12 Total 805 403 402 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated home population 15.6 Adjusted Live Birth Rate 15.0 Illegitimate live births per cent. of total live births 3.35 STILL BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 8 — 8 Illegitimate 1 — 1 Total 9 — 9 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births Total Live and Still Births 11.05 814 INFANT DEATHS (under I year of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 18 9 9 Illegitimate 2 2 — Total 20 11 9 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 24.8 Legitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 23.13 Illegitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births 74.07 NEO-NATAL DEATHS (under four weeks of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 14 8 6 Illegitimate 2 2 — Total 16 10 6 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 19.9 Early Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (first week) per 1,000 live births 16.14 Perinatal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live and still births 27.02 Maternal Deaths (excluding abortion) nil Maternal Mortality Rate (including abortion) per 1,000 total births nil 5 DEATHS Male 232 Female 213 Total 445 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— Crude Death Rate 8.6 Comparability Factor 1.57 Adjusted Death Rate 13.5 Death Rate from pulmonary tuberculosis 0.02 Death Rate from cancer 1.37 Birth and Death Rates for England and Wales, 1959 Birth Rate 16.5 Still Birth Rate (per 1,000 live and still births) 20.7 Death Rate 11-6 Deaths under one year of age 22.6 Deaths under four weeks of age 15.8 Maternal causes, excluding abortion 0.32 Due to abortion 0.06 Total maternal mortality 0.38 Table of Birth and Death Rates for previous 10 years Year * * † † ‡ Infant Under 1 yr.

Three of these new cases occurred in the age group 15-24 years. This is a decided improvement on the figures for 1958 and follows the national pattern in the general downward trend in the number of new cases being notified each year. New and efficient drugs, Mass X-Ray and innoculation of susceptible adolescents with B.C.G. vaccine have all played their part in this fall. However, tuberculosis is still with us and complacency can be dangerous. Diphtheria No cases occurred in the district during the year and, as before, the Middlesex County Council at their clinics in the district, together with the local general practitioners, continued the immunising campaign against the disease. 838 children completed full courses of primary immunisation and 728 received re-inforcing injections against diphtheria. Immunity against this disease must be kept at a high level. Cases of diphtheria do still occur from time to time and in the non-immunised if not fatal can leave the child with severe and crippling defects. In this day and age not to have a child immunised is tantamount to criminal neglect. Whooping Cough. The number of cases notified was 38 as compared with six for the previous year. Due to the complications that can 8 accrue from this infection it is essential that children are protected by immunisation as early as possible in their life. 787 children received full courses of primary immunisation and 296 received re-inforcing injections against the disease. Acute Poliomyelitis No cases of poliomyelitis occurred during the year. Table 11 shows one death from Paralytic Poliomyelitis. This patient whose home happened to be in this district actually contracted the disease and died while working in another part of the country. Smallpox Vaccination Number of primary vaccinations 628 Number of re-vaccinations 51 In these days of Jet air travel when people move from one Continent to another in the matter of hours the risk of imported infection is constantly with us. Everyone should be protected against smallpox. This is best done in infancy. Food Poisoning Seven unrelated cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. Investigations were made in all cases but it was not possible to ascertain any specific source of infection in any of the cases. Dysentery Forty cases of Sonnei Dysentery occurred during the year and the majority of these cases were notified during five weeks in November and December. The outbreak was fairly well localised and followed the usual pattern. Spread was from house to house due to the intermingling of infected children with their friends. Every case notified is followed up by a member of the Health Department and every opportunity is taken to impress upon the families concerned the need for the most careful personal hygiene. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year. National Assistance Act, 1948—Section 47 It was not found necessary to take action under the National Assistance Act in respect of persons requiring care and attention. In certain cases arrangements were made with the Area Medical Officer for the assistance of Home Helps. Housing Since house building recommenced in 1946 this Authority has built 2,226 dwellings and 1,463 private dwellings have been erected. 9 There was still a demand for houses, mostly from young couples who were sharing accommodation with parents. Maternity and Child Welfare and School Health Services This district forms part of Health Area 10, Middlesex County Council, who provide numerous sessions for antenatal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services at the following clinics:— Cardinal Road, Feltham Grove Crescent, Hanworth Imperial Road, Bedfont. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Water Analysis The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District were supplied by the South-West Suburban Water Company and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South-West Suburban Water Company was taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water was derived from the River Thames, purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines, and Walton, and filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. The water supply was satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. Samples for bacteriological and chemical examination were taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least five times each week and eighteen raw water and one hundred and twenty treated water samples were taken by the South West Suburban Water Company, including twelve in the Feltham area. In addition, four samples were taken by my department. Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board Supply.

The water supplied had no plumbo-solvent action but samples were tested for presence of metals. No action was required in respect of contamination of the water. All water was chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains were chlorinated before being restored to use. With the exception of two condemned but occupied cottages, all the houses in the area were supplied from the public water mains. 11 CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure Action within the framework of the Council's programme for dealing with unfit houses was continued, details of which are given below. The rate of progress slowed down somewhat due to a number of causes, but the determination to deal with all the unfit houses remained and it is hoped that greater strides will be taken in 1960. At the latter end of the year confirmation without modification was received of the Compulsory Purchase Order made in respect of the Fern Grove Clearance Area. The provision of alternative accommodation was under way and it was expected that the re housing of the occupants of the 29 houses would not be long delayed. From 1946 until the end of 1959, 244 houses had been dealt with as follows:— Demolition Orders made 210 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair or Closing Orders made 34 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal action 206 Persons who have been displaced 671 Action taken during 1959 is as follows:— Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 8 Demolition Orders made 1 Closing Orders made 2 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 17(1) 2 Houses closed under Sections 16 (4), 17 (1) and 35(1) 5 Houses closed under Sections 17 (3) and 26 — Parts of buildings closed under Section 18 — Houses in respect of which agreements entered into with owners to repair — Total number of persons displaced 10 Housing Repairs Defects in dwelling houses continued to receive attention and systematic house-to-house inspection was pursued. It was found on these house-to-house visits that quite a number of the older houses were becoming owner-occupied. This, in 12 many cases was the best solution and the occupiers were able to make very pleasant and comfortable houses, which a landlord could not economically do. A number of houses which had been included in the list of possible demolitions were in fact dealt with by way of repair. Repair to Housing Act standard, however, did not completely satisfy many tenants. What they needed were improved amenities. The standard improvement grants can help to provide these amenities but landlords have not so far taken advantage of them. Appeals were lodged against 15 notices served under the Housing Act, 1957, but had not been determined by the end of the year. Informal Action Number of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local authority 62 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with a view to service of formal notices 52 Number of formal notices served 28 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:— (a) by owners 2 (b) by local authority in default of owners — Housing Act, 1957 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Sections 9 and 16):— (a) by owners 2 (b) by local authority in default of owners — House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959— Standard Improvement Grants This Act came into operation on the 14th June and provided for the payment of grants of half the cost of providing standard amenities, subject to prescribed maxima, depending upon the amenities already existing. The standard amenities are (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a wash-hand basin; (c) a hot water supply; (d) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; and (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. 13 The conditions for obtaining a grant are not onerous and it is to be hoped that advantage will be taken to equip many of the older but sound houses with these necessary amenities. Twenty-one applications were received and sixteen had been approved by the end of the year. Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair Applications for Certificates of Disrepair and for the cancellation thereof were received and dealt with as set out below. The figures show a considerable reduction as compared with the previous year. It is rather surprising how few tenants, despite increases in rents, took advantage of the opportunities afforded them under the Act to secure repairs. No. of applications for certificates 8 No. of decisions not to issue certificates 3 No. of certificates issued 3 No. of undertakings given by landlords to remedy defects 3 No. of undertakings refused by local authority — No. of applications for cancellation of certificates 9 No. of certificates cancelled 11 Overcrowding Ten cases of overcrowding were found and reported to the Public Health Committee. Most of the cases concerned housing applicants and they were referred to the Housing Committee for consideration. Thirteen known cases of overcrowding were abated during the year. Moveable Dwellings Public Health control of moveable dwellings in the area is effected by means of the Middlesex County Council Acts, 1944-1956 and by byelaws. The consent of the Council is required to the placing or keeping of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. It has been the Council's policy for many years to deter the use of caravans in the area as permanent dwellings. During the year five applications for consent were received. In one case consent was given for a period of six months, in two others it was refused and in two cases decisions were deferred. Action was taken which secured the removal of six other moveable dwellings and the cessation of use of one caravan in respect of the use of which no consent Had teen given. In 14 one instance the occupier was prosecuted under the abovementioned Acts and the Magistrates imposed a fine of 40s. Od. with £2 2s. Od. costs. Food Premises Regular inspections of all types of food premises were made, special attention and more frequent visits being made to catering establishments, premises registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, bakehouses and other places where food is actually prepared. It is considered that there was still much room for improvement in the display and handling of food for sale, but at the same time it is felt that further significant progress is only likely if either the public becomes much more conscious of food hygiene than at present or food legislation is amended. The Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, gave impetus to slowly rising standards and as a result many improvements were effected, particularly with regard to washing facilities; but five years have passed, the wave has lost its strength and a little back flow is perceptible. Now is the time for a campaign for a fresh surge forward. Public awareness and demand is unlikely to provide the spur at present so amending regulations calling for better standards should do so. It is felt that the public generally would support such measures. Health and Hygiene Exhibition During and as part of the annual carnival week in June a health and hygiene exhibition was organised. Held in a marquee on Feltham Green the theme was clean food and clean air. In addition to the display arranged by the department, the North Thames Gas Board, Solid Smokeless Fuels Association and the Southern Electricity Board provided displays and the two former demonstration vehicles also. The attendances on the two Saturdays was good and the visitors seemed to find the displays of interest. Shops All shops were regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. Two licences were renewed to keep pet shops. The occupier of one shop renewed his licence to deal in game. The 'late day' for the general closing hours of shops in the area was Friday, but shopkeepers remained free to fix their own half-day closing, subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops closed for the half-day on Wednesday. 15 There was no evidence of shops remaining open after the closing hours. A number of shops opened on Sundays and inspections were made in connection with the limited range of articles permitted to be sold on that day, but it appeared that generally the requirements of the Act were being observed. Food premises in the district consist of the following:— Catering establishments, including factory canteens and school kitchens 116 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 70 Greengrocers' shops 39 Butchers' shops 28 Bakers' shops 17 Milk shops 8 Fishmongers' shops 15 Sweet and confectionery shops 64 Food Preparing Premises Two premises were registered during the year. The register contained the addresses of 35 premises registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc.14 Premises used for the cooking of fish 12 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle, etc., who are not the occupiers of open shops for the sale of foodstuffs, are required to be registered with the local authority and any foodstores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered, but there is no requirement that hawkers shall have a food store. Public Health control over hawkers' activities is less exacting than over food shops and is more difficult of application but efforts were made to maintain a reasonable hygienic standard. Two new hawkers of foodstuffs were registered. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from fixed sites in any public street are required to hold a licence under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. There was only one street trader in the area whose licence to sell fruit and vegetables was renewed during the year. One new application for a licence was refused. 16 Slaughter-Houses Slaughtering in the area virtually ceased, two of the slaughter-houses were not used at all and the other on only one occasion. Number of slaughter-houses licensed 3 Number of slaughtermen licensed 7 Knackers Yard There was one licensed knackers yard, which, however, was not used. Inspection and Supervision of Food Carcases and Offal inspected at slaughter-houses Three pigs which had been slaughtered were inspected and found to be fit for human consumption. Meat and other Foods Inspected Carcase meat and offal was inspected at butchers' shops and catering establishments and the following was considered unfit for human consumption:— Beasts Calves Sheep Pigs Tuberculosis — — — — Other condition 1343 lbs. 194 lbs. 349 lbs. 350 lbs. In addition, the following amounts of other foodstuffs were found to be unfit for human consumption:— Fish 178 lbs. Chicken 517 lbs. Sausages 39 lbs. Ham 10 lbs. Bacon 28 lbs. Beans 38 lbs. Biscuits 62 lbs. Rabbits 16 lbs. Flour 27 lbs. Jam 2 lbs. Tinned Foodstuffs Meat 215 lbs. Fruit 114 lbs. Fish 1 lb. Vegetables 15 lbs. Milk 4 tins Bacon 13 lbs. Gammon 241 lbs. Ham 4 lbs. Disposal of Condemned Food Where possible condemned foodstuffs were sent to a waste products factory, where they were processed for nonedible purposes. Foodstuffs which were not suitable for such disposal were buried at the Council's refuse tip. 17 Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department, Mr. J. A. O'Keefe, for details of action taken in this district. Samples procured:— Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (New) 5 — Milk (Various) 20 1 Cakes and Biscuits 6 — Cream 5 — Drugs 4 — Fish and Fish products 10 — Fruit—Fresh and Canned 4 — Ice Cream 19 — Liver 3 — Meat and Meat Products 22 — Spirits 4 — Sweets 7 — Vinegar and N.B.C. 15 — Miscellaneous 11 — Totals 135 1 The sample noted as unsatisfactory was that of a bottle of milk which contained a piece of glass. The milk bottle was found to have a damaged rim and there was no evidence that the bottle had not been damaged whilst in the custody of the purchaser. No further action was taken. 119 premises were inspected under the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 mostly in connection with the marking of certain foodstuffs with the country of origin. The majority of the infringements detected were of a minor nature and were dealt with by verbal warnings. Two official cautions were issued, one to a retailer and another to the retailer's shop manager and one successful prosecution was undertaken under the main Act against a retail greengrocer for applying false trade description of weight to carrots. The labelling of Food Order, 1953, requires pre-packed food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and, in the case of compounded food, the names of the ingredients. It also requires that the name and address or registered trade mark of the packer or labeller be given. 509 articles of pre-packed food were examined at 78 premises but no infringements were detected. In addition, advertisements and the labels of pre-packed foods were scrutinised to detect false or misleading descriptions. No serious infringements were disclosed but corrective action was sought in one or two cases. For example, where slimming claims were made in association with lemon juice 18 drinks, and where some soft cheeses were described as "cream cheese". Some extravagant claims in respect of medical remedies were also challenged and the advertisements withdrawn. One licence was issued to use the designation "pasteurised" in relation to milk processed in the area. Premises were inspected regularly and 59 samples taken. The premises and samples were satisfactory. Nineteen samples of raw milk were tested for tubercle bacilli but none was contaminated. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk), (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. Dealers licences were granted to sell graded milk as follows: Tuberculin Tested 7 Pasteurised 7 Sterilised 19 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin Tested 13 Pasteurised 13 Sterilised 14 There were 24 distributors of milk and one dairy. Complaints were received in respect of ten milk bottles which either contained foreign matter or were not clean. Warnings were given in each case. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive regular attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in the area. Seven premises were registered, under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the sale of ice cream. As in previous years the Council received complaints with regard to the noise and disturbance caused by the various instruments used by mobile ice cream vendors. On the 1st December a byelaw made by the Middlesex County Council with regard to noisy hawking came into force. It remains to be seen whether this measure will enable an improvement in the position to be achieved. Clean Air The Council supported the setting up of a Clean Air Coordinating Committee embracing adjoining districts and in April the West Middlesex Clean Air Co-ordinating Committee was formed. The constituent authorities were the Borough of Ealing and the Urban Districts of Hayes and Harlington and Feltham. It was hoped that other districts would eventually participate. 19 In August the Council received the Minister's provisional approval to the proposed No. 1 Smoke Control Area and subsequently decided to proceed with the detailed survey. The proposed area consists of the whole of the district north of the Staines Road, embracing some 2,050 houses and 120 other premises and covering 1,398 acres. A phased programme was adopted which envisaged dealing with the whole district by 1972. Pollution of the atmosphere by fumes and smoke from diesel engines is undoubtedly increasing. Whilst not encountered so much on the quieter residential road, on through roads, including shopping areas, they were often most apparent and quite apart from any possible effect upon health these fumes are unpleasant. The Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations prohibit the emission of smoke, visible vapour, grit, sparks, ashes, cinders or oily substance but only if it is likely to cause damage to property or injury or danger to persons, on or likely to be on the road. It appeared that in respect of many vehicles the regulations were not being observed. Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was continued. The Council's refuse tip was kept under regular observation and any sign of rat activity dealt with immediately. It was not considered necessary to test bait the public sewers. Previous reports on rodent control have covered the financial year period, this report deals with the nine months period to 31st December, 1959, and future reports will relate to calendar years. Complaints received of infestations numbered 186 and these, together with cases discovered by members of the staff, involved the inspection of 841 premises. Rat infestations were found at 147 premises and mice infestations at 32 premises. Of these 171 treatments were undertaken by the department, the remaining eight being carried out by the occupiers. For treatments carried out by this department on behalf of occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings was made in the case of private dwellings and the full cost of the treatment was recovered in the case of business premises. In certain cases of hardship the standard charge was waived. Where the occupiers elected to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision was given to ensure that the treatment was effective. 20 Arrangements were continued with the Middlesex County Council for the department to carry out any rodent control works necessary on the portions of the Duke of Northumberland's River and the River Crane in the area. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 Three premises were registered under this Act, but very little filling material was used. Five inspections were made. Disinfestation One Council dwelling was found to be infested with bed bugs and was disinfested by the department with contact insecticides incorporating D.D.T. It was not found necessary to disinfest for bed bugs the furniture, etc., of prospective Council house tenants before removal to the Council's houses but the Engineer and Surveyor, who is responsible for the maintenance of these houses, treated ingoing tenants' furniture for "woodworm" where necessary. Other disinfestations for the eradication of pests were carried out as follows:— Wasps 81 Cockroaches 1 Infectious Disease—Disinfestation One house was disinfected at the occupier's request after a case of scarlet fever.
