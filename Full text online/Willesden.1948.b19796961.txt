WIL 44 AC439(1) WILLESDEN Borough of Willesden 1948 THE 73rd ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT S. LEFF, M.D., D.P.H., Barrister at Law, Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WILLESDEN Health Department, 54, Winchester Avenue, Kilburn, London, N.W.6. November, 1949. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Willesden. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances in the Borough for the year 1948. Since the presentation of my last Report, considerable changes have occurred in the administration of the local health services. The National Health Service Act, 1946, which became operative on July 5th, 1948, transferred the administration of the personal health services of the Willesden Council to other authorities. The School Medical Service was transferred to the Middlesex County Council on April 1st, 1945, under the Education Act, 1944. The powers of the Middlesex County Council in this respect were delegated to the Willesden Divisional Executive, and local interest and initiative was maintained by a strong representation on this body of local councillors and local persons connected with education. The National Health Service Act, 1946, transferred the whole of the maternity and child welfare functions of the Council to the Middlesex County Council, which became the local health authority of the area. The Middlesex County Council was divided into ten areas for the purposes of the exercise of many of these functions. Willesden was combined with Wembley to form Area No. 6 (population 310,950), which is administered by an area health committee, acting as a sub-committee of the Health Committee of the Middlesex County Council. This sub-committee is composed of representatives of the Willesden and Wembley Councils and the Middlesex County Council and local health workers' organisations. A system of efficient delegation of functions to the area committee and the harmonious working of the three major constituent authorities—Willesden, Wembley and the Middlesex County Council—has not yet been worked out, with the result that local interest and initiative has not had the same stimulus as in the past. The School Health Service functions of the Willesden Divisional Executive, except for school medical and dental inspection, were also transferred to the area committee. The supervision of foster children and the administration of the residential nursery, Connaught Hostel, are now the functions of the Children's Committee of the Middlesex County Council, reponsible to the Home Office. This committee was formed as a result of the Children's Act, 1948. The two local authority hospitals, the Willesden Isolation Hospital and the Willesden Maternity Hospital, together with the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Willesden General Hospital, were transferred to the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, and the general administration of these hospitals is discharged by the Central Middlesex Hospital Management Group. The members of this body are appointed by the Hospital Board, who are themselves appointed by the Minister. The representation on these committees of local elected representatives or local "consumer" interest has been small, and it has therefore been difficult to keep alive the local interest and pride in the hospitals. The maternity service has unfortunately suffered a serious division in its administration. The maternity beds are controlled by the local Hospital Management Committee, the ante-natal clinics conducted by the assistant medical officers of health and the domiciliary midwives by the local health authority, and the general practitioner obstetricians by the local Executive Committee which organises the work of doctors, dentists, pharmacists, etc. A smooth-running, efficient, unified service finds some difficulty in emerging from this gestation. Progress in the development and administration of the health service is hampered by the fact that the reorganisation of local government powers and boundaries is long overdue. The health services retained by the Willesden Council are largely impersonal environmental services, and there has been a considerable expansion in the work of housing inspection and repairs, and in the supervision of factories and food hygiene. It is gratifying to note that the general health of the Borough has been maintained at a high level, and it is particularly pleasing to note that the infant mortality rate has continued to decline from 31.44 in 1947 (53.91 in 1938) to 23.51 in 1948. In contrast, the number of tuberculosis cases on the register has increased from 1,389 in 1947 (863 in 1938) to 1,504 in 1948. I wish to thank all members of the staff who have given such valuable and loyal service to the Council over many years, and especially those who worked so hard with unstinting energy to make the " change-over" as smooth as possible. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, S. LEFF, Medical Officer of Health. 3 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF AREA Population, 1948 179,900 Population Census, 1931 184,434 Pre-war Population, 1938 187,600 Area of the District in acres 4,634.5 acres Number of Persons per acre 78 Number of Habitable Rooms 200,320 Number of Persons per room 0.94 Rateable Value £1,618,423 General Rate for the year 16s. 6d.

This especially applies to the neo-natal death-rate, which has not been reduced to the same extent as the infant mortality rate. Whereas, previously, our major efforts in prevention were concentrated on the children between one month and one year old, while not relaxing our efforts on the children in this age group, emphasis must now shift to the prevention of death of children under four weeks. As the report of the Joint Committee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the British Pædiatric Association, 1949, on Neo-Natal Mortality and Morbidity said: "The evidence goes to show that the present neo-natal mortality and still-birth rates could be reduced by one-third to one-half, and if they were there would be a saving of about 15,000 babies each year in England and Wales alone." The causes of death of the 37 babies who died in Willesden during 1948 during the first week of life were: Prematurity 8 Atelectasis 12 Bronchial Pneumonia 1 Birth Injuries 3 Deformities at Birth 8 Intestinal Obstruction 1 Murder by Strangulation 1 Asphyxia Neonatorum 3 237 premature infants were born in Willesden in 1948, 47 at home and 190 in hospital. Special attention is paid to these babies by midwives and health visitors in the homes, but home nurses specially trained to care for premature infants should be provided. There is also need for a special premature unit to be established at the hospital. Efficient ante-natal care and good obstetrics are essential to reduce the number of deaths in this age period. The most important factors are: (1) Good nutrition of mother. (2) Education of the mother with regard to pregnancy, labour, breast feeding and the care of the child. Other factors are: (1) Improvement of the general social and economic circumstances of the mothers and children. (2) The prevention of hæmolytic disease due to the Rh. factor. (3) The provision of anæsthetics and analgesia in midwifery. (4) The prevention of birth injuries. (5) The efficient care and handling of the new-born baby and a proper nursing technique adopted on the part of all midwives. (6) The prevention of infection in the new-born baby, with special reference to bronchial pneumonia. (7) The general education and training of the mother. (8) The provision of hospital beds and paediatricians for the care of premature babies. (b) Still-Births Number of still-births registered in Willesden, 1936-48: Year No. of Births No. of Still-Births Still-Birth Rate 1936 2,835 86 29.44 1937 3,058 100 31.67 1938 2,968 101 32.91 1939 2,738 78 27.70 1940 2,315 85 35.42 1941 1,758 50 27.65 1942 2,550 84 31.89 1943 2,657 71 26.03 1944 2,697 74 26.71 1945 2,627 68 25.23 1946 3,420 92 26.20 1947 3,753 92 23.93 1948 3,147 71 22.56 Still-births have to be considered in relationship to the neo-natal mortality, for the death of a child under one week can be considered as a "still-birth which has just managed to survive." Proper and efficient ante-natal care and obstetrics are important in the prevention of still-births. 6 (c) Infant Mortality Rate The infant mortality rate as a whole has shown a marked decline since 1944. An analysis of the infant mortality rates figures in the individual wards comparing the three-year period 1936-38 with 1946-48 shows the decline has not been uniform: Ward Infant Mortality Rate, 1936-38 Infant Mortality Rate, 1946-48 Reduction 1946-48, as compared with 1936-38 Carlton 75.69 24.86 50.83 Harlesden 74.49 39.39 35.10 Willesden Green 73.80 29.27 43.53 Roundwood 70.78 43.04 27.74 Kilburn 67.66 34.62 33.04 Manor 65.20 37.17 28.03 Stonebridge 60.49 40.59 19.90 Church End 51.35 28.44 22.89 Neasden 46.82 10.75 36.07 Mapesbury 43.81 22.36 21.45 Cricklewood 43.26 19.97 23.29 Kensal Rise 33.80 17.80 16.00 Brondesbury Park 25.06 20.83 4.23 Whole Borough 59.47 28.96 30.51 Larger reductions have taken place in the wards where the poorer sections of the population live (Carlton, Kilburn and Willesden Green), as compared with the wards where the better.class population live (Brondesbury Park, Mapesbury and Cricklewood). It has been suggested that the infant mortality rate is correlated with the number of health visitors in an area, and the reduction in the rate is more marked in areas where there is a greater number of health visitors. There is no appreciable difference in the number of health visitors employed in the various wards, nor in the number of attendances made by the mothers to the welfare clinics. The reduction in the rate is probably due largely to the improved nutrition of the mothers, and consequently there has been more scope for betterment in the poorer sections of the population where malnutrition has been more prevalent. (d) The Infant Mortality Rate for Illegitimate Children The infant mortality rate for illegitimate children was 26.88 per thousand illegitimate live births, which was only slightly higher than the infant mortality rate for legitimate infants (23.3). Special facilities are given for the admission of babies to day nurseries, where they receive special care. In addition, a home to accommodate twelve homeless mothers with their illegitimate children has recently been opened by the Middlesex County Council at 167, Willesden Lane. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE The work in connection with the examination of specimens, which for some years has been carried out by the local authority at Willesden Municipal Hospital, is now undertaken "by the Public Health Laboratory Service at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale Avenue, N.W.9, and at their branch laboratory, which was opened in August, 1947, at the Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, N.W.10. Specimens such as swabs for sore throats, faeces from any suspected intestinal infection, sputum and postnasal swabs from children with suspected whooping cough are delivered by private practitioners direct to the branch laboratory at the Neasden Hospital or to the Health Department, 54, Winchester Avenue, N.W.6, or the Willesden Health Centre, 381, High Road, Willesden, N.W.10, for collection and transfer to the laboratory. A presumptive report, which is likely to be of value to the private practitioner in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient, is telephoned to the practitioner on the morning after receipt of the specimen, and a written report follows within the next day or so. Samples of milk taken by the Sanitary Inspectors from dealers in the district are also forwarded to the laboratory for examination. During the year 1948, the following work was undertaken at the laboratory: Throat Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli 15 Haemolytic Streptococci 266 Vincent's Angina 3 Negative 995 Total 1,279 / Fæces: Shigella - Salmonella 3 Protozoa — Negative 8 Total 11 Sputum: T.B. Smear 297 Other Organisms - Negative 1,098 Total 1,395 Pertussis: Cough Plate - Post-nasal Swab 4 Negative 13 Total 17 Milk: Pasteurised 81 Other 1 Ice Cream 8 Water: Domestic Supplies, etc. - Swimming Pools 137 Miscellaneous 25 Total 2,954 AMBULANCE SERVICE The Ambulance Service of the authority was transferred to the control of the Middlesex County Council on July 5th, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946. The ambulances (five for sickness, accident and maternity cases and one for infectious diseases), which operated from the Willesden Isolation Hospital, are now stationed at the Fire Station, Pound Lane, Willesden, N.W. 10, under the management of the Fire Brigade Officer. The service is now free of charge and is available for the removal of patients from places within the county to places outside. Sitting-case cars are also provided. The Ambulance Officer is entitled to satisfy himself in each case that there is need for transport. Calls in respect of the use of the ambulance are made via the following telephone numbers: WILlesden 2222 GLAdstone 2222 WILlesden 2223 ELGar 2222 LADbroke 2224 HOSPITAL SERVICE The following hospitals and clinics come within the control of the Central Middlesex Hospital Management Committee: No. of Beds No. of Beds Hospitals: in Hospital in Group Central Middlesex County Hospital, Park Royal, N.W. 10 1,098 Central Middlesex Hospital Maternity Annexe, Acton 18 Willesden General Hospital, Harlesden Road, N.W. 10 106 Acton Hospital, Gunnersbury Lane, Acton 81 St. Monica's Home, N.W.6 26 Willesden Maternity Home, Honeypot Lane, N.W.9 56 Neasden Hospital, Brentfield Road, N.W.10 200 1,585 Clinics: Tavistock Clinic, Beaumont Street, W.l. T.B. Dispensary, Willesden, N.W. 10. St. Andrew's Hospital, Dollis Hill (103 beds), was disclaimed by the Minister of Health, and therefore remains an independent hospital outside the jurisdiction of the Central Middlesex Hospital Management Committee and the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. There is still need for further hospital provision in the area. The Ministry of Health Hospital Survey, 1945, after referring to the need for the modernisation and extension of the Neasden Hospital, said: " For fully adequate hospital service further acute and maternity beds are required, and it may well be desirable to develop Willesden General (200 beds), St. Andrew's (200 beds), Wembley (150 beds), and if land can be obtained, Acton (150 beds), as branch sub-district hospitals. Further acute and chronic beds will be required at Central Middlesex (including some to replace unsatisfactory existing accommodation) and a few maternity beds which may be provided there or at the Willesden Maternity Annexe as may be convenient." 8 MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICE (I) MATERNITY SERVICE: Maternal Mortality Rate— During 1948 there were 3 deaths classed to pregnancy and child-bearing. The puerperal mortality rate was .95 per 1,000 registered total births. During 1948 there were 3 maternal deaths from non-puerperal causes. The total maternal mortality from all causes, including criminal abortion, was therefore 1.91 per 1,000 registered total births. (a) ANTE-NATAL CARE: At each of the three municipal health centres two doctors conduct four ante-natal sessions weekly. During 1948, 3,475 expectant mothers attended for medical consultation, making a total of 16,348 attendances. At the three centres, seven area midwives hold seven sessions per week. 580 expectant mothers, with 3,426 attendances, were seen at these clinics. The Council's consultant obstetrician attended the health centres on 75 occasions during the year (once every fortnight at each centre), and the mothers seen totalled 584 attendances. The Queen Charlotte's Hospital ante.natal clinic at 84, Princess Road, held 51 sessions, which were attended by 130 mothers on 864 occasions. 588 expectant mothers booked for confinement in the Central Middlesex Hospital were referred to the Willesden Health Centres for ante.natal care in 1948. 819 home visits were made by the Council's health visitors to expectant mothers on the request for special reports by various hospitals where they were booked for their confinement. Health Centres: (1) Kilburn Health Centre, 9, Willesden Lane, Kilburn, N.W.6. Opened November 1st, 1916. (2) Willesden Health Centre, 381, High Road, Willesden, N.W.10. Opened October 1st, 1917. (3) Stonebridge Health Centre, Harrow Road, N.W.10. Opened April 8th, 1930. (4) Princess Road Infant Welfare Centre, N.W.6. Previously a voluntary centre, but was taken over by the Council on April 1st, 1942. The Centres are now out of date and overburdened with work, with the result that they are often overcrowded. It is especially difficult for expectant mothers, who in two centres have to negotiate awkward stairs in order to visit the consulting rooms on the top floor. Clinics are urgently needed in the northern part of the area which, because of its later development, has no clinic provision. Teaching of Mothercraft: Mothers are taught mothercraft at special classes held at the centre, and 429 attendances were made by mothers at classes at Stonebridge Health Centre during the year. Classes have now commenced in all three centres. Dental Treatment: During the year 1948, 476 expectant mothers attended the health centres on 1981 occasions for dental treatment. Although the local assistant Medical Officers of Health attend the Central Middlesex Hospital monthly for the purpose of instruction in the practice of midwifery, it has been found impossible, at present, to arrange for them to do practical midwifery as envisaged in Circular 118/47. Similarly, it has been impossible to arrange for the general practitioners to assist in the ante.natal work of the clinics. As a result, the co.operation between these doctors, which is so essential for an efficient midwifery service, has had little opportunity to develop. Sterilised Accouchement Sets: 403 sets were supplied from January 1st, 1948, to July 4th, 1948, 63 at full cost and 163 at part cost, and the remainder free. 303 sets were issued free from July 5th, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946. (b) DOMICILIARY MIDWIFERY: The number of whole-time municipal midwives is 10, 3 of whom are relief midwives. In addition, 2 midwives and 1 part-time midwife are employed by the Queen Charlotte's Hospital District Home, and they deal with midwifery cases in part of the Carlton ward. The Willesden District Nursing Association employed 3 district midwives acting as maternity nurses. There are no midwives in private practice in the area. Watling and Willesden Training School for Second Period Pupil Midwives The work of the domiciliary midwives in Willesden is combined with the midwifery work of the Watling and District Nursing Association as a training school for Part II midwives. During the year, 35 pupil midwives were trained on the district. Of the 35 pupils, 26 sat for the final examination, 25 passed, 1 failed, but passed at the subsequent examination. 9 Number of Cases attended by Midwives practising and living in Willesden during 1948 Number of Cases Attended Emergency Calls Cancelled Cases As Midwife As Maternity Nurse Private District Midwives — — - — Municipal Midwives 509 — 7 87 Midwives attached to Queen Charlotte's Hospital District Home, 40, Princess Road, N.W.6 111* - - 35 Midwives attached to the Willesden District Nursing Association, 17.19, Park Avenue, N.W.2 — 179 - 17 Totals 620 179 7 139 * In addition, 51 cases outside Willesden were attended by midwives from this Home. 224 calls were made for medical aid, 181 in respect of the mother, and 43 in respect of the child. Administration of Gas and Air Analgesia: The number of mothers who had gas and air analgesia during labour increased from 54.3 per cent for the last six months of the year 1947 to 79.6 per cent for the last six months of the year 1948. This increase was largely due to a publicity campaign which was ably supported by the doctors, midwives, health visitors and the local press. General Practitioners and Midwifery: There was a slight reduction in the number of births attended by general practitioners, 179 in 1948, as compared with 192 in 1947, but the fall in the birth-rate (from 21.07 in 1947 to 17.49 in 1948) probably accounts for this reduction. The average annual number of maternity cases dealt with by general practitioners in the last eight years was 164. The Council made available the services of their consultant obstetrician to assist a medical practitioner in connection with a difficult case of labour, puerperal fever or puerperal pyrexia, but no calls were made on his services during the period January 1st, 1948, and July 4th, 1948. Home Helps: During the year, home help was provided for 109 mothers (13.6 per cent of the 799 home confinements), 65 through the official home help scheme and in 44 cases the Council paid the home help chosen by the mother. There is room for a considerable expansion of this service for mothers. (c) HOSPITAL CONFINEMENTS: During 1948, 1,098 mothers were confined in the Willesden Maternity Hospital and 1,071 in other hospitals, as follows: 530 in Central Middlesex Hospital; 50 in St. Mary's Hospital; 89 in Queen Charlotte's Hospital; 26 in Middlesex Hospital; 28 in University College Hospital; 63 in Queen Mary's Maternity Home, Hampstead; and smaller numbers in other hospitals. 100 were confined in a nursing home in Hampstead, and smaller numbers in other nursing homes and maternity homes. In Willesden, 5 nursing homes providing accommodation for 4 maternity patients and 20 other patients were on the register at the end of 1948. 20 mothers were confined in the nursing home with accommodation for maternity patients. The total number of confinements of Willesden mothers which took place in hospitals and nursing homes was 2,169, 71 per cent of the total births (2,968). The demand for institutional midwifery has increased owing to the overcrowded conditions in the homes and the fact that the hospital service is now free. It is therefore to the mother's financial advantage to have the child in hospital, where she has not the expense of board, home help and laundry. 10 Willesden Maternity Hospital: 1,394 patients were booked during 1948 for confinement in the Willesden Maternity Hospital. The lees varied from 9 at £15 0s. Od. to 178 free, with an average of £2 1 Is. 7d. per case. 793 mothers were booked without charge from the date of operation of the National Health Service Act, 1946, namely, July 5th, 1948. During 1948, 75 applicants for confinement in the Willesden Maternity Hospital were unable to be booked, 52 cases because there was no bed available, and 23 because their home conditions were satisfactory. (d) POST-NATAL CARE: 214 post-natal sessions were held during the year, and 286 patients attended. Mothers are referred to the Central Middlesex Hospital for further investigation and treatment if it is found necessary. (2) INFANT WELFARE SERVICE: At the three health centres, two doctors conduct ten infant welfare sessions weekly. A part.time doctor holds two sessions weekly at the Princess Road Centre. The health visiting staff assist in the clinics and visit the mothers in their homes to give general advice and assistance on the care of the child. Number of Health Visitors: Health Visitors (full-time) 18 Health Visitors (part-time) 2 Health Centre Matrons 3 Health Centre Nurses 4 Chief Health Visitor and Non.medical Supervisor of Midwives 1 Orthopaedic Nurse 1 2,062 children attended the three health centres and 414 attended Princess Road Centre, i.e., 65.5 per cent of the total number of children (3,147) registered as born alive in 1948. There were 1,344 sessions held in the three health centres, and 42,401 attendances were made. 3,932 attendances were made at the Princess Road Centre. Total number of visits and revisits made by health visitors=64,922, i.e.: Maternity and Child Welfare 49,774 School Medical Service 10,795 Infectious Diseases 3,329 Child Life Protection 698 Others 326 Total 64,922 Infants and schoolchildren are referred to general practitioners for domiciliary treatment, and to the hospital for the opinion of a consultant. Before the operation of the National Health Service Act, 1946, mothers often could not afford the fees of a private practitioner, and difficulty was found in providing medical attention for the child in the home. Since July 5th, 1948, this difficulty has been overcome as the children are now .entitled to the services of a general practitioner without payment. There is, however, a need for a closer liaison between the general practitioner, the Assistant Medical Officer of Health and the paediatrician in the care and treatment of the child. Supply of Drugs to Centres: Before July 5th, 1948, the three pharmacists employed by the local authority for work in the hospital service and in the health centres prepared the medicines and drugs for the health centres and attended regularly in order to distribute them. It was found impossible to continue this service permanently after the transfer of these officers to the Regional Hospital Board, and the medicines are now supplied by a firm of manufacturing chemists and are distributed by the health visitors. Hospital Treatment of Children under 5 Years of Age: Five children were admitted to Stanmore Hospital for orthopaedic conditions. The two hospitals which largely deal with children in this area are the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Paddington Green Children's Hospital. Child Life Protection: At July 4th, 1948, there were 29 foster mothers and 43 foster children in Willesden. The supervision of foster children has now been transferred to the Children's Committee of the Middlesex County Council, and at the end of 1948 there were 38 foster mothers and 51 foster children. 11 Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, 1939: Under Section 7 (3), 11 persons gave notice in respect of 12 children up to July 4th, 1948, and 3 persons gave notice in respect of 7 children at the end of the year. 3 children were under supervision at the end of the year. DAY NURSERIES: There are 10 day nurseries with accommodation for 490 children. There is a waiting list of 1,248 children, of whom 145 are in the prority classes; that is, either the child has no father or no mother, or one of the parents is a chronic invalid. The areas with the longest waiting list are still Kilburn, Harlesden and Cricklewood, and another nursery is urgently required for the Kilburn area. Cost of Admission: Up to July 4th, 1948, the cost was on the scale up to a maximum of 7s. 7d. per child per day. As from July 5th, 1948, the charge has been fixed at 1s. 0d. per day, but in two cases, owing to economic circumstances, no charge was made. Staff Establishment: Supervisory Matron 1 Supervisory Warden 1 Matrons 10 Deputy Matrons 10 Wardens 10 Nursing Staff 60 Students 30 Domestics (mostly part-time) 40 Training of Students: During the course of the year, 21 students have been in training at the day nurseries. Wardens: There is a general shortage of wardens, and only 4 out of the 10 day nurseries in Willesden have a warden on their staff, and play therapy and education of the children in the other day nurseries is suffering. Medical Supervision: The nurseries are visited regularly by the Assistant Medical Officers in order to supervise the health of the children and the hygiene of the nurseries. Infectious Diseases: The following table gives the number of children in the nurseries who suffered from infectious diseases during the year: German Measles Measles Whooping Cough Mumps Chicken Pox Scarlet Fever Infantile Paralysis 1 100 23 15 33 4 1 Measles Prophylaxis: In order to modify the severity of an attack of measles, contacts were injected with globulin or serum. 26 out of 103 contacts were injected, 16 with serum, 5 of whom developed modified measles, and 10 with globulin, none of whom contracted measles. Parents' Evenings: Parents' evenings were initiated in 3 of the day nurseries, and have now been followed in the remaining 7. These have been very successful and are much appreciated by both parents and staff. The meetings take place monthly and have comprised educational films, talks, "make-do-and-mend" and dressmaking classes, in addition to social evenings and theatre visits. NURSERY AND CHILD MINDERS ACT, 1948: The above Act became operative on October 1st, 1948, and three private day nurseries have come under the observation of the department. 12 CONNAUGHT HOSTEL: The hostel has accommodation for 12 children. The total number of children admitted to the hostel during the year was 182, with an average length of stay of 24 days. Reasons for Admission: 163 were admitted because of confinement of the mother, and 19 because the mother was admitted to a hospital or convalescent home. Medical Care: The health of the children is under the supervision of the medical officer from the Stonebridge Health Centre, who visits weekly. A general practitioner is available in case of emergency. The hostel was transferred to the care of the Children's Committee on December 5th, 1948. CHILDREN'S HOMES: Accommodation No. St. Andrew's House, Barretts Green Road, Willesden 26 Chamberlain House, Barretts Green Road, Willesden 30 Morgan House, Barretts Green Road, Willesden 30 The Bungalow, Barretts Green Road, Willesden 20 14, Nicoll Road, Harlesden 12 6, Prout Grove, Willesden 13 8, Prout Grove, Willesden 13 The Children's Homes were transferred from the Public Assistance Committee of the Middlesex County Council to the Children's Committee, following the Children's Act, 1948. The health of the children and the hygiene in the Homes are now supervised by the medical officers from the centres, except in the case of Barretts Green Road, where only the hygiene of the Homes is dealt with. HOME HELP SERVICE: There has been a considerable development of this work during 1948, but great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining an adequate number of home helps. The number of administrative staff employed during 1948 were: Home Help Organiser 1 Clerical Staff (part-time) 1 Number of Home Helps: Period Whole-time Part-time Approx. equivalent to Whole-time As at January 1st, 1948 9 12 15 As at December 31st, 1948 17 73 53½ The full-time helpers usually do two or three sick or chronic cases a day or work full-time on maternity cases. During the year 44 home helps resigned for various reasons, mainly because they found the work too hard. The number of applications received in respect of maternity cases has increased, but many mothers do not avail themselves of this valuable service. This may be due to the fact that they cannot afford the charge for this service at a time when they are already involved in heavy additional expenses. Review of Applications: Period Number of Applications received Number actually helped Not helped— insufficient Home Helps available Not helped for various reasons January 1st, 1948, to December 31st, 1948 595 511 50 34 Summary of Cases Helped: Period Maternity Tuberculosis Blind Others Total January 1st, 1948, to December 31st, 1948 65 57 14 375 511 13 Fees Paid by Applicants: Up to July 5th, 1948, a charge of 2s. 6d. per hour was made according to a scale, but as from July 5th, 1948, a charge of 1s. l0d. per hour was made according to a scale, with complete exemption for old-age pensioners. During the year 1,736 visits were made to the homes of the applicants by the Domestic Help Organiser. HOME NURSING SERVICE The home nursing is performed by the Queen's Institute of District Nursing, at 17.19, Park Avenue, N.W.2, and their functions were transferred to the Middlesex County Council as from July 5th, 1948. Number of Home Nurses employed at December 31st, 1948: Whole-time Part-time 20* 8 * Included in this 20 are 3 midwives who act as maternity nurses. 1,324 cases were nursed from July 5th to December 31st, 1948. Summary of Cases: Maternity Miscarriages 0-5 Years Tuberculosis General Total 68 17 146 45 1,048 1,324 Equipment, e.g., bed-cradles, air pillows, bed-pans, blankets, rubber waterproof sheeting, etc., can be obtained on loan on application to the Willesden District Nursing Association, or the Area Health Office. No charge is made for this service. Home Nurse: The Home Nurse, employed by the Council, nursed 89 cases from January 1st, 1948, to July 5th, 1948, and in connection with such cases paid 427 visits. The 89 cases nursed during 1948 were new cases. 84 of these cases were referred by the Health Department and 5 by private doctors. Nursing Homes: The five nursing homes in the Borough were inspected on 14 occasions. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT: During the year 1948, 16 premises were dealt with; 3 persons were granted a licence, 12 a renewal of a licence, and 1 person received exemption under Section 363 of the Act. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC: A birth control clinic is held at 84, Princess Road, Kilburn, N.W.6, under the auspices of the North. West London Women's Welfare Centre. Sessions are held on Tuesdays from 10 to 11 a.m., Wednesdays from 2.30 to 3.30 p.m., and Thursdays from 5.30 to 6.30 p.m. A charge is made for first visits only, the fee being from 1s. 0d. to 5s. 0d., according to the patient's means. CHEST CLINIC: At the Chest Clinic at Pound Lane, N.W.10, patients are investigated and contacts supervised. The Clinic was transferred from the County Council to the Central Middlesex Hospital Management Committee, and the close collaboration between the Chest Clinic and the Health Department still continues. GENERAL PRACTITIONER SERVICE: An Executive Council has been constituted to provide general medical, including maternity, services, proper and sufficient drugs, medicines and prescribed allowances, general dental and a supplementary ophthalmic service, for all persons who require treatment under the National Health Service Act, 1946. There will be a closer unity between the Executive Council and the local health authority when provision is made by the local health authority under Section 21 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, for the erection of health centres, where general practitioners and local health authority medical officers can work together. 14 HEALTH EDUCATION There has been a considerable expansion in the health education in the Borough in 1948. Health lectures with films were commenced in schools and day nurseries, and have now been given in all the senior modern schools and all the day nurseries. There are regular meetings of the staff where both clinical and administrative subjects are discussed and films are shown. The doctors, health visitors and midwives meet monthly, and the day nursery matrons every two months. The sanitary inspectors meet monthly, when the general work of the department and matters of interest are discussed. Arrangements have been made to provide health education at evening meetings for many organisations in the Borough. The medical and nursing staff visit the Central Middlesex Hospital, twice a month, for refresher demonstrations by the paediatrician and obstetrician on the care of children and the practice of midwifery. SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE During 1948, 5,490 children were medically inspected at routine inspections as follows: Entrants 2,454 Second age group 1,917 Third age group 1,119 There were also 17,085 reinspections. There is need for the provision of special medical inspection rooms at the schools, with adequate waiting accommodation for parents and an adequate supply of medical equipment and hot water for the medical and nursing staff. Difficulty has been experienced in arranging medical inspections in some schools because of lack of accommodation resulting from the increase in the number of pupils and classes.

Three children under 5 years of age were treated under the Council's Scheme for the removal of Nævi. REPORT OF THE OPHTHALMIC SURGEON TO THE COUNCIL: B. R. Medlycott, D.O.M.S., M.B., B.S. (Lond.), M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., Ophthalmic Surgeon to the Council. Mr. Medlycott visits each health centre weekly.

Firstly, an optician is no longer in attendance at each session. Free choice of optician remains as in the past. Prescriptions for spectacles, when received from the Middlesex Executive Council, are handed by the parent to the optician of their choice for dispensing. Secondly, children now receive a much better free issue spectacle, the choice being the same as for the adult population, but unfortunately the delay in supply and for replacements is just as long. Thirdly, nursing and expectant mothers, as well as children under the age of five, no longer attend the Ophthalmic Clinics. There is danger under this ruling that young children with concomitant squints may fail to receive occlusion at the most vital and advantageous age. Fourthly, as a dispenser is no longer in attendance, supplies of drugs are ordered direct from Allen & Hanburys Ltd., ready made up in small quantities suitable for issue to the patient.

Ear, Nose and Throat Department: The work of this department was carried out by Mr. A. L. Pereira, F.R.C.S., who attended the Health Centres on 61 occasions and examined 212 children under the age of 5 years, and 892 schoolchildren. Attendances were as follows: Kilburn Health Centre (once monthly)— 9 Sessions: 32 children under the age of 5; 154 schoolchildren. Willesden Health Centre (once monthly): 11 Sessions: 104 children under the age of 5; 285 schoolchildren. Stonebridge Health Centre (once weekly): 41 Sessions: 76 children under the age of 5; 453 schoolchildren. Dermatological Department: Owing to the illness of Dr. Haldin Davis, Dermatologist to the Council, the work of the department was suspended in the greater part of the year. It is with regret that I have to report the death of Dr. Haldin Davis, as he was the first consultant employed by the Borough Council, in 1913, and gave 35 years' excellent service to thousands of schoolchildren in the Borough. OrthopÆdic Department: Mr. K. I. Nissen, M.D., F.R.C.S., B.Sc., Orthopædic Surgeon, attends Stonebridge Health Centre once a fortnight, and during the year held 24 sessions where 977 attendances were made, 423 of which were in children under the age of 5. A full.time physiotherapist is on the staff at Stonebridge Health Centre, where all orthopaedic treatment is carried out. A subsidiary centre has now been set up at the Lower Place P.H. School, where Mr. Nissen holds 1 session in 6 weeks and the physiotherapist attends 2 sessions per week. Hospital Treatment for Orthopædic Conditions: 10 children were admitted to Stanmore Hospital for orthopaedic conditions. LOWER PLACE P.H. SCHOOL AND COLLEGE ROAD E.S.N. SCHOOL: There are two schools for handicapped children in this area, Lower Place Physically Handicapped School (149 pupils, of whom 102 (68.5 per cent) are Willesden residents), and College Road Educationally Subnormal School (126 pupils, of whom 94 (74.6 per cent) are Willesden residents). The Senior Assistant Medical Officer is responsible for the medical supervision of the children in both these schools, and ascertains the physically handicapped and the educationally subnormal children in the Borough as a whole. He also examines children from other divisional executives in Middlesex for admission to the schools. Convalescent Treatment of Children 5-15 years of Age: 221 delicate children, i.e., 135 boys and 86 girls, were sent to convalescent homes during the year. SPEECH THERAPY: Two part-time speech therapists are employed for 12 sessions weekly. They hold clinics at the three health centres and visit the schools regularly.

The problem is quite serious and widespread, and it has been estimated that 200,000 children suffer from rheumatism in England and Wales and that at least one-quarter of the prolonged absences from school are due to this disease. An important function of the clinic is to exclude the diagnosis of rheumatism in children with aches and pains and thus avoid unnecessary restriction of their activities or their schooling. A Rheumatism Clinic is held once weekly at each clinic and is conducted by the Senior Assistant Medical Officer of Health. A full environmental history is taken by the health visitor and a complete medical examination is made by the doctor. The child is referred to the paediatrician of the Central Middlesex Hospital if further investigations or hospital admission is required. All children discharged from hospitals with rheumatism are followed up and special sessions are held at the physically handicapped school for the rheumatic children who attend there. The parents are given general advice on the care of the child, insanitary conditions are remedied as far as possible, and arrangements are made for hospital admission, convalescence, special schooling or special treatment as required. Summary of Cases: Kilburn Health Centre 27 16 rheumatism (10 with carditis). 11 non-rheumatism. Willesden Health Centre 41 14 rheumatism (6 with carditis). 27 non-rheumatism. Stonebridge Health Centre 49 25 rheumatism (13 with carditis). 24 non-rheumatism. Total 117 55 rheumatism (29 with carditis). 62 non-rheumatism. 27 of the rheumatism cases had been discharged from hospital or convalescent home with a diagnosis of the disease. Family History: This appeared to be of no significance in this series, as of the 37 children who gave a history of the disease, only 14 were suffering from rheumatism. Environmental Conditions: These did not appear to be of any significance in this series. Of the 45 children where there was dampness in the home, only 24 actually had rheumatism. Of the 42 children who shared a bed, 21 had rheumatism. 74 cases were investigated for economic status: Under a week 2 No. with rheumatism 0 „ £5 „ 8 „ „ „ 4 „ £6 „ 25 „ „ „ 12 Over £6 „ 39 „ „ „ 19 The removal of tonsils and adenoids did not seem to have any significance in this series: Operated on Normal Enlarged Septic Rheumatism 20 20 6 9 Non-rheumatism 17 37 5 3 Treatment of Cases: Admitted to Hospital 3 Sent for Convalescence 16 Sent to Lower Place School 8 Already at Lower Place School 4 To Orthopaedic Surgeon 5 To Ear, Nose and Throat Department 7 To Dental Department 6 Medicinal Treatment 25 CLO + malt or malt + iron 16 Although there is a close liaison between the Rheumatism Clinic and the Central Middlesex Hospital, a paediatrician attached to the clinic would be of great benefit to the service. There is also need for more hospital beds for observation and treatment, for the provision of hospital schools and convalescent places for these children, and for the provision of clothing and shoes for the poor children. 19 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Infectious Diseases: No. of Cases Notified No. of Notified Cases Confirmed 1947 1948 1947 1948 Diphtheria 63 48 12 15 Scarlet Fever 284 325 261 306 Pneumonia 263 195 248 180 Whooping Cough 589 435 571 423 Erysipelas 55 43 52 39 Measles 1,451 1,290 1,434 1,281 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION: Since 1942 the number of children who have completed a full course of immunisation under the Council's scheme is as follows: Children under 5 years Children 5 years of age and over, but under 15 years Total 1942 1,833 2,660 4,493 1943 1,691 2,520 4,211 1944 1,193 338 1,531 1945 1,983 493 2,476 1946 2,033 654 2,687 1947 1,808 156 1,964 1948 2,435 174 2,609 During 1948, immunisation was also carried out by private practitioners in respect of 141 children under the age of 5 years, and 53 children of school age in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946. The approximate mid-year population 1948, as supplied by the Ministry of Health, based on ration books, was 15,544 under 5 years of age, and 20,663 between 5 and 15 years of age. Since the inception of the scheme for immunisation until the end of the year 1948, it is estimated that 56 per cent of those under 5 years and 84 per cent of those between 5 and 15 years had been immunised. Report on an outbreak of Diphtheria in a School: On November 30th, 1948, a school child in Class 6 died in Willesden certified as "tonsillitis," but the cause of death was probably diphtheria. On the same day the child, sitting at the same desk, was notified as a case of diphtheria due to infection with C. diphtheria gravis. Between December 3rd and 6th, the class was swabbed, and one nasal carrier was discovered. All available children were immunised or given booster doses. About this time a case occurred in Class 7. The contacts in this class were also swabbed, but no carrier was discovered. Dust from the two classrooms was examined, and C. diphtheria; gravis was isolated. The classrooms were thoroughly cleaned. Two new cases were notified on December 20th, one from Class 6 and one from Class 2. No carriers were found among the contacts. During the Christmas holidays, three more cases were notified, which were apparently unconnected with the outbreak. One was a child who had been absent from school throughout the period of the outbreak; the second was her brother, and the third a man aged 35 years. When the school reopened, another case appeared in a boy aged 15 years, again unconnected with the original cases. Classes 6 and 7 were again swabbed and another nasal carrier was found. Two weeks later, a case occurred in the nursery class of the school. All the children in this class were given anti-toxin and a boosting dose was given to those who had previously been immunised in infancy and had not received boosting doses on entry into the nursery class. OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTIFIED DURING 1948: Disease No. Notified Enteric Fever 5 Dysentery 13 Malaria 1 Poliomyelitis and Polio-encephalitis 16 Cerebro-spinal Fever 5 of which 3 were confirmed No cases of encephalitis lethargica were notified. 20 Report on Anterior Poliomyelitis Cases: 16 cases of anterior poliomyelitis were notified during the year. 11 of these 16 cases were confirmed; this includes 1 confirmed case of polio-encephalitis. No deaths were recorded as poliomyelitis or polio-encephalitis. Of the 11 confirmed cases, 8 had slight paralysis and were discharged from hospital to their own home and remained under the treatment and supervision of the Orthopaedic Department of Stonebridge Health Centre. 2 cases had severe paralysis, and on discharge from hospital were admitted to the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore. The remaining case had a normal recovery. Pneumonia and Influenza: 195 cases of pneumonia were notified in 1948, and deaths from bronchial pneumonia, lobar pneumonia and pneumonia (unspecified) numbered 57. There were 4 deaths from influenza. Whooping Cough: 435 cases were notified in 1948 (423 confirmed), but a total of 613 came to the knowledge of the health visitors. 439 were under 5 years of age. There were 2 deaths from whooping cough in 1948 in children between the ages of 1 and 5 years. Immunisation against Whooping Cough: 2,087 children had a combined course against diphtheria and whooping cough, and 2,007 were under 5 years of age and 80 between 5 and 15 years of age: 875 were immunised against whooping cough only. The total number of children immunised against whooping cough was 2,962. Measles: 1,290 cases were notified in 1948, but a total of 1,490 cases came to the notice of the health visitors, 864 of which occurred in children under 5 years of age. There was 1 death from measles in a child under 1 year of age during the year. Measles Prophylaxis (See report on Day Nurseries) Ophthalmia Neonatorum: 10 cases were notified in 1948, a case rate of .32 per 1,000 registered live births. Complete recovery with unimpaired vision resulted in all ten cases. TUBERCULOSIS: A comparison of the number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis which actually occurred in the Borough in the individual wards in 1936-38 with the numbers occurring in 1946-48 shows some interesting features. The pulmonary tuberculosis rate for the Borough in the period 1936-38 was 1.107 per 1,000 population (ranging from 0.687 to 1.705 in the various wards), while for the corresponding period of 1946-48 the tuberculosis rate had increased to 1.427 (range of 1.005 to 2.042), an increase of 0.320 (range of —0.032 to 0.790). (See Table 1, columns A, B, C and D.) The increase in the tuberculosis rate is probably a real one, for there was little improvement in diagnostic facilities during this period. This is illustrated by the fact that 50 per cent of the cases in 1948 were either undiagnosed or diagnosed after some delay (15.96 per cent were undiagnosed at death and another 34-04 per cent were only diagnosed within 12 months of death). There is no reason to believe that there was any difference in the standards of diagnosis and notifications in the different wards. There was no extensive operation of the mass miniature radiography unit in Willesden during this period. The major factor in the production of this deterioration in the tuberculosis rate is probably the increase in the overcrowding of the Borough. An enquiry was carried out by the Social Survey for the Ministry of Town and Country Planning in the winter of 1946-47, and a report was published on their findings in December, 1947, entitled " Willesden and the New Towns." The report said: "A very considerable larger proportion (55 per cent) of Willesden households were sharing a dwelling with other households than was the case in the London region (25 per cent) or in England and Wales (7 per cent) (page 1)." "4 per cent. [that is 1 in every 25 families, and in some districts 1 in every 10] were living in a single habitable room (page 25)." There is a high correlation between the figures of the tuberculosis rates and the overcrowding figures for 1936-38 and 1946-48. Unfortunately, the figures for the two periods are not strictly comparable as the data of 1936 referred to the number of families overcrowded according to the Ministry of Health standards, while the figures for 1948 referred to the number of persons per room according to the Borough Engineer's estimate after an extensive survey of the area, which was based on random sampling of houses and population. (See Table 1, columns A, C, H, I.) The four wards with the largest increase were Church End, Mapesbury, Willesden Green and Harlesden, with a range of 0.517 to 0.790 (compared with an increase of 0.320 for the Borough as a whole), while the four lowest were Roundwood, Brondesbury Park, Kensal Rise and Neasden with a range of —0.032 to 0.072.

(See Table 2, columns D and E.) The increase in the number of houses and flats between 1936 and 1948 is largely offset by the number of dwellings destroyed by bombing. In addition, many houses have been requisitioned for bombed-out families and have become overcrowded as a result of increases in the family. (See Table 3.) The families who are probably the most overcrowded are those who live in a single room. In Mapesbury, where the largest number (347) of families have been placed in requisitioned houses, 10 per cent of the families in the ward occupy a single room, as compared with 4 per cent for the Borough as a whole. (See page 27, Social Survey Report.) Mapesbury also has more subdivided houses than any other ward. (See page 86, Social Survey Report, Appendix II, Table 1.) There is also a concentration of families occupying a single room in Harlesden and Manor. (See page 27, Social Survey Report.) Willesden Green has particularly suffered because many small industries have commenced there since the war in accommodation usually reserved for living purposes. These industrial premises in converted houses have not only reduced the amount of living accommodation, but have also introduced new dangers to health because they are often insanitary. It is significant that whereas an average of 51 per cent of the Willesden residents work within their own district, 66= per cent of the population of Willesden Green work in that area. It is difficult to estimate the general effect of industry on the T.B. rates in Willesden because 40 per cent of the residents work outside the Willesden area and many outside residents travel to work into the area. Other general factors which must have affected the tuberculosis rate are: the premature discharge of infectious tuberculosis cases from sanatoria and hospitals at the beginning of the war, and the fact that today there is a shortage of sanatorium beds, which means there is often a delay of six months between the diagnosis and admission to sanatorium for treatment. During this period many of the infective cases come in contact with susceptible persons because of the overcrowded conditions in the homes. A study of the changes in the T.B. rates at different ages shows some interesting features. With the single exception of the age group 65+ (males), there is a marked rise between 1936-38 and 1946-48 in the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, which was particularly marked in the age group 0-15 (numbers nearly doubled) and 15-35 for males (increase 26 per cent). This may very well be due to the persons in these age groups being particularly susceptible to tuberculosis infection in conditions of overcrowding in the home. By contrast, there has been a fall in the number of new cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis in all groups, with the exception of 35-65 (females) and 65+ (both sexes).

The service is constant and the water of excellent quality. Sewage and Drainage: Most of the sewage of the Borough is discharged into the London County Council main sewers, but a small amount, viz., from the Park Royal area, is discharged into the West Middlesex Main Drainage system. All the buildings in the Borough are now drained to the Council's sewers. During the year, three cottages at Stonebridge Park, which were served by chemical closets, were converted to the water-carriage system and the drains connected to the Council's sewers, as a result of notices served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Refuse Disposal: House refuse is collected weekly. Trade refuse is collected as often as is deemed necessary and at an agreed charge to the trader. Refuse is dealt with by controlled tipping at Twyford. In March, 1948, the duty of enforcing the provision of dust-bins was transferred from the Health Department to the Borough Engineer's Department. Disinfestation: Disinfestation of dwelling-houses, premises and chattels is carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors, but in the case of persons removing to new Council dwellings it is carried out by contractors. Bedding materials are disinfested at the steam disinfector at the Neasden Hospital: (a) Number of applications to rooms in private dwelling-houses [Note: Some rooms treated more than once) 444 Number of applications for beetle infestations in canteens, etc. 8 (b) Number of verminous rooms cleansed 284 Number disinfested under Council's Scheme 197 Number of primary inspections of verminous premises 185 Number of reinspections 319 (c) Disinfestation by HCN carried out by contractors: Number of removal disinfestations 66 Number of premises disinfested by HCN - Disinfestation of bedding at Municipal Hospital (loads) 52 Public Mortuary: During 1948 bodies were deposited at the Mortuary as follows: From Willesden From Acton Total Post-mortems 281 63 344 Post-mortems and Inquests 84 30 114 Adjourned Inquests 31 13 44 Accommodations 3 — 3 Swimming Baths: The Borough has three swimming baths, one closed bath at Granville Road, open all the year round, and two open baths, King Edward's and Gladstone Park Baths, open from May to September. From May, 1948, to the end of the year, 86 samples of water from the Borough's three swimming baths were taken. The results from the closed bath at Granville Road and from King Edward's Bath were generally satisfactory. Samples from Gladstone Park Bath were occasionally unsatisfactory, and this was mainly due to the inadequate sanitary and shower-bath facilities, the slow turnover in filtration and inadequate chlorination. In addition, there was frequent choking of the filters from grass and other foreign matter which gain access to the bath water because the surrounds of grass slope down to the pool. The surface drainage around the pool is generally unsatisfactory, and contamination of the water therefore results. Bathrooms: Over half the Willesden families do not possess their own bathroom, one in three have no bathroom, and one in four have to share with another family. Less than half the Willesden families (41 per cent) have a bathroom of their own. Water Closets: Approximately one in four families (22 per cent) share a water closet, and where a dwelling is occupied by three or more families, almost three-quarters (68 per cent) share the water closet. Gardens: Although Willesden is poorly equipped with public open spaces (a provision of 242 acres for a need ol 1,313 acres), one in four families have no garden at all. Where the dwelling was subdivided for the occupation of two or three families, the garden was often shared. 25 SANITARY SECTION Staff: The staff of Sanitary Inspectors at December, 1948, consisted of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, the Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector and twelve District Sanitary Inspectors, with two vacancies. The Council, during the latter part of the year, decided to conduct a clean-food campaign in conjunction with food traders, and to make a survey of factory conditions in the Borough. The Council therefore secured the approval of the Minister of Health to an increase of three in the establishment of Sanitary Inspectors, making a total of 19 Sanitary Inspectors. The additional Sanitary Inspectors did not commence duty until after the period covered by this Report. In order to increase the number of available qualified Sanitary Inspectors, the Council amended the Student Sanitary Inspectors' Scheme, which had been in operation for some 18 years, and four pupils were attached to the Sanitary Inspectors' Department in December, 1948. Food Poisoning: There was an outbreak of food poisoning in a factory, affecting 36-40 persons. There were also several cases of illness which were probably due to contaminated food. All these cases were investigated and samples of suspected foods submitted for analysis, but no pathogenic organisms were isolated. Clean Food Campaign: Towards the end of 1948, at the request of the Council, a meeting was called of traders in the Borough w ho prepare, handle and sell foodstuffs with the intention of enlisting their aid in promoting hygienic handling of food. The meeting was addressed by Dr. Robert Cruickshank, formerly of the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, the Medical Officer of Health and the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Photographs, bacteriological cultures and charts were displayed. The need for hygienic methods in food handling was fully explained to the audience, and the practical means by which improvement could be secured were demonstrated. As a result of this meeting, the Willesden Hygienic Food Committee was formed. The traders were fully represented on this committee and expressed their willingness and desire to co-operate with the Council in the campaign for improved hygiene in the handling of food. Smoke Abatement: During the year, the number of complaints of smoke, grit and sulphur emissions from the three powerstations in the Borough increased. Some neighbouring local authorities, whose inhabitants were affected by the air pollution emanating from the Willesden power-stations, made repeated representations to the Council. In October, 1948, a deputation of the Willesden, Acton and Wembley Councils was received by a representative of the Minister of Health. A promise was given that all authorities connected with the generating stations would take measures, as far as possible, to mitigate the nuisance. Premises Inspected: The number of premises inspected on complaint was 6,898, and the total inspections and reinspections were 36,562. The total number of notices served was 6,038, an increase of approximately 36 per cent, as compared with 1947 (3,941 notices served). The number of notices complied with was 5,230, an increase of approximately 44 per cent on 1947 (2,951 notices complied with). In 1948, 85 per cent (5,237) of the notices served were complied with, as compared with 75 per cent (2,951) complied with in 1947. Number of intimation notices served 4,329 Number of statutory notices under the Public Health Act, 1936, served 1,649 Number of statutory notices under the Housing Act, 1936, served 60 Details of all Inspections, 1948: Number of premises inspected on complaint 6,898 Number of premises inspected in connection with infectious diseases 2 Number of periodical inspections of premises 3,815 Houses inspected from house-to-house (Housing Act) 93 For certificates or reports under Rent Acts 54 Public-house urinals 249 Mews and stables 75 Miscellaneous 1,107 Smoke observations 240 Ministry of Health Circular 2845 (Inadequately Housed Families) 124 Total number of primary inspections 12,657 Reinspections (for all purposes) 23,905 Total number of inspections and reinspections 36,562 26 Burial of the Destitute Dead: Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the powers which the County Council had under the Poor Law Act are replaced by duty placed on the Borough Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, this duty being exercisable only where it appears to the Council that no other suitable arrangements have been or are being made. The Council entered into a contract with a local undertaker to carry out these burials, and from the date of operation of the Act, namely, July 5th, 1948, to December 31st, 1948, 3 cremations and 11 burials were arranged. The Council decided that, subject to the wishes of all persons concerned, the remains of the deceased persons should be cremated.

Rats and Mice Disinfestation: Rodent control measures have been carried out during the year under the approved methods of the Ministry of Agriculture (Infestation Branch), and three operators were engaged on the following surface infestations: Total number of premises treated 507 „ ,, new Agreements 24 ,, ,, Agreement renewals 47 „ „ business premises 98 ,, „ Borough properties 16 „ „ private dwellings 322 27 The cost of the work of disinfestation at business premises, amounting to £802 5s. 2d., was recovered from the occupiers. In the case of private dwellings and Borough Council premises, £549 5s. 9d., i.e., 50 per cent of the cost, was recovered under Grant Aid from the Ministry under the terms of Circular N.S.I9. Co-operation has been obtained with the Engineer's Department in regard to the opening of pavements where suspected outbreaks and faults have been detected in defective drainage systems. The work of sewer disinfestation is carried out by the Borough Engineer's Department. There has been an increase in the number of complaints compared with last year, and approximately 25 per cent more work was done at business premises and 7 per cent at private dwellings. Bombed Sites: During the year numerous complaints were received from residents in the Borough as to nuisances arising from bombed sites. Where nuisances were found, action was taken if the responsible person could be ascertained, but in other cases the Borough Engineer removed the material causing the nuisance. Rodent infestations were dealt with by the Rodent Destruction staff where found necessary. The Medical Officer of Health reported to the Council on all the bombed sites in the Borough, and the following summary indicates the extent of this difficult problem: Number of sites adequately fenced 48 (29.8 per cent) Number of sites—fencing in poor condition or inadequate 39 (24.2 per cent) Number of sites unfenced 61 (37.9 per cent) Number of sites—building in progress 13 (8.1 per cent) 161 Number of sites where nuisance from accumulations of rubbish, debris, etc. 113 (70.2 per cent) Number of sites clear of nuisance 35 Number of sites—building in progress 13 161 Number of sites where alleged rat or mice infestation 17 Number of sites treated by Rodent Officer 3 Persons in need of Care and Attention, Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948: The attention of the Medical Officer of Health is usually drawn, by relatives, to a person who is in need of care and attention. A visit by the health visitor and sanitary inspector is then arranged to determine the possibilities of the provision of care and attention in the home with the assistance of relatives or neighbours, a home help and/or -a district nurse. If it is decided that institutional care is essential, the first thing which is considered is whether the person agrees to accept a vacancy, if a place can be found for him, otherwise Section 47 has to be invoked. The question of whether he is infirm or sick and thus requires institutional or hospital accommodation is determined in difficult cases with the assistance of the general practitioner and the welfare officer. The general practitioner is invariably consulted with regard to any provision to be made for any person he has under his care, and his advice in border-line cases of infirm or sick has been invaluable. The degree of urgency is then determined and the local welfare and hospital officials have been most co-operative in arranging for the admission for special cases referred to them. Owing to the shortage of accommodation in the hospitals and in the hostels for the aged and infirm, a great deal of assistance has had to be given in the home by the provision of home helps and home nurses. In many instances relatives have had to care for aged persons in overcrowded homes in very trying circumstances. During the year 1948, the necessary Court Order was obtained in one case, that of a man aged 78 years, "who was removed to the Redhill House on September 1st, 1948, and remained there at the end of the year. 28 THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT on the WILLESDEN MATERNITY HOSPITAL for the period January 1st to July 4th, 1948.

SCHICK TEST AND ACTIVE IMMUNISATION AGAINST DIPHTHERIA Nursing Staff: During 1926, a commencement was made in Schick Testing the Nursing Staff and immunising those nurses who proved susceptible to Diphtheria. Since that date, 19 cases of Diphtheria have occurred: 1927 1 1932 1 1937 2 1942 - 1947 - 1928 1 1933 - 1938 1 1943 1 1948 - 1929 1 1934 2 1939 2 1944 - 1930 2 1935 1 1940 - 1945 - 1931 - 1936 2 1941 1 1946 1 (1) Number of cases of Diphtheria occurring amongst Student Nurses during the first eight months of 1926 (before immunisation was carried out) 9 (2) Incidence rate per annum (taking 30 as average number of Student Nurses) 45 per cent (3) Number of cases of Diphtheria occurring amongst Student Nurses from 1927 to 1948 19 (4) Incidence rate per annum (taking 30 as average number of Student Nurses) 2.87 per cent (5) Number of Nurses Schick-tested (1927-48 inclusive) 556 (6) Number of Nurses giving a positive reaction 223 (7) Percentage of Nurses giving a positive reaction 40.1 per cent 31 Disease Number in Hospital on December 31st, 1947 Admitted from January 1st, 1948, to July 4th, 1948 Total under Treatment Died Mortality per cent Cerebro-spinal Fever 1 — 1 — — Diphtheria 2 12 14 1 7.1 Enteric Fever 2 — 2 — — Erysipelas 2 13 15 — — Measles 6 95 101 — — Puerperal Infections 1 3 4 — — Scarlet Fever 26 120 146 1 2.5 Whooping Cough 2 37 39 — — Poliomyelitis 7 4 11 3 1.8 Other Diseases 18 144 162 — — Marasmus 5 1 6 — — Tonsil and Adenoid cases - 18 18 — — Totals 72 447 519 5 — THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT for the YEAR 1948 on DENTAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT By E. A. JENNINGS, L.D.S., R.C.S.Eng. Divisional Dental Officer. I have the privilege to submit my Thirty-first Annual Report. As commented upon in many previous Annual Reports, the dental service continued to be handicapped by the same problem of shortage of accommodation and operating staff. The Year's Work: From the staff of four dental officers, one resigned and left the public service on June 30th. For the remaining six months of the year it was only possible to fill the vacancy for five weeks with the services of a locum tenens. However, Willesden must be considered fortunate to have retained most of its staff in view of the exodus which is so marked a feature of local authorities throughout the country since the introduction of the National Health Service. The total number of sessions recorded by the staff is as follows: Treatment Sessions allocated to School Health Service 1,349 Routine Inspection Sessions allocated to School Health Service 101 Treatment Sessions allocated to Maternity and Child Welfare 350 Sessions allocated to administration 44 Total 1,844 Included in the above total are 171 sessions attended by the Anæsthetist. Sessions lost on account of sickness = 46. Sessions allocated for family bereavement = 10. The School Health Service: Routine.—8,459 children, or 38.4 per cent out of a total school population of approximately 22,000, were inspected at the schools. 101 visits were made by the dental officers, and 84 inspections per session were averaged. 5,461, or 64.5 per cent, were found defective and referred for treatment. Complete recording of all defects found was carried out at the time of inspection. The total number of parents attending the routine inspections was 3,235, or 38 per cent. Specials.—2,946 children attended the centres for inspection, an increase of 596 over last year's equivalent, but of these 259 had no defect. Included in this number are many children who attended for advice between periods of their routine inspections and treatments, and were not all cases of neglect as is usually surmised. 32 Dental Inspection and Treatment: (1) No. of Children in age groups who were inspected at the Schools and treated at the Centres by the Dental Officers: Aged Schoolchildren Special Schools' Children Nursery Schools' Children Inspected Referred Treated Inspected Referred Treated Inspected Referred Treated 3 — — — — — — 56 27 7 4 — — — — — — 61 34 12 5 299 133 101 — — — 16 8 3 6 954 474 386 — — — — — — 7 919 526 486 — — — — - — 8 978 680 462 — — — - — — 9 749 539 366 — — — - — — 10 767 557 394 — — — - — — 11 732 496 291 — — — — — — 12 567 414 234 — — — - - - 13 734 449 184 — — - - — — 14 718 480 270 — — — - — — 15 636 451 240 — — — - - — 16 201 148 68 — — — - — — 17 72 45 25 — — — - — — Totals 8,326 5,392 3,507 — — — 133 69 22 (2) Specials: 2,918 2,662 2,311 28 25 25 — — — Total (Routine and Specials): 11,244 8,054 5,815 28 25 25 133 69 22 (3) Number of Attendances made for treatment: — 13,651 — — 66 — — 46 — (4) Half-days devoted to: School children Special School children Nursery School children Inspection 99 — 2 Treatment 1,334 8 7 Total 1,433 8 9 (5) Fillings: Permanent teeth 6,754 36 — Temporary teeth 1,013 2 49 Total 7,767 38 49 (6) Extractions: Permanent teeth 926 16 — Temporary teeth 6,878 18 11 Total 7,804 34 11 (7) Number of: General anæsthetics 3,167 17 5 Local anæsthetics 102 - - Total 3,269 17 5 (8) Other Operations: Permanent teeth 1,944 15 — Temporary teeth 466 2 4 Total 2,410 17 4 Maternity and Child Welfare Statistical Table for 1948: Total E.M.
