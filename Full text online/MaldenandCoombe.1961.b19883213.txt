AC 4413 (1) MAL 25 Borough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1961 (1) BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBE ANNUAL REPORT of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1961 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. July, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1961 which has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular No.1/62. The statistics recorded in the body of the report do not reveal any marked deviation from those of previous years. One disturbing feature is a continual steady rise in the number of deaths from Lung Cancer. The report includes for the first time a table shewing the pattern of deaths from this disease over the past few years. There is little doubt that the increase in incidence is caused by controllable features in the environment, though the exact part played by each of them has yet to be correctly defined. Heavy cigarette smoking is unquestionably a significant causal agent while atmospheric pollution is also suspected to be a contributory factor. It is difficult to see what steps will be effective in controlling the increasing frequency of this disease. Perhaps the most effective means would be within the family, by the example of parents having been made aware of the facts and encouraged towards non-smoking. The heroic image associated with the glamour of smoking in the minds of children has to be transformed on a national and international scale if our young people are to be dissuaded from adopting this habit which has grown to be so much a part of our everyday life. Producers of films and plays both for Television and Cinema, even of comic papers and strips, can all play a valuable (2) part in creating a picture of adult behaviour which is associated with non-smoking rather than smoking. This sort of co-operation will be necessary if any campaign is to be effective. Adequate housing has for many years been accepted as a fundamental requirement for a healthy family. This is a concept upon which local authority housing is based and acceptable standards have risen with successive legislative measures, Thus we are not now in this district dealing with gross deficiencies and overcrowding (though these are occasionally encountered) but with more subtle aspects of the home environment as it affects health. Many housing applicants produce medical certificates in support of their claim for priority of rehousing. Evaluation of the relative merits of such supporting factors is by no means an easy task and much time is given to detailed consideration of each case. The help of family doctors is necessary as well as the cooperation of the Housing Manager. It is sometimes difficult for applicants to perceive that medical priority can only be given in cases where illness is substantially made worse by existing housing conditions or where there is risk of spread of infection; and even where these circumstances exist it is not possible for immediate rehousing to take place. The adoption by the Council of the scheme whereby special consideration is given to the housing needs of persons who are permanently physically disabled has provided a means of helping them in circumstances where no other source of assistance was available and has provided practical assistance towards overcoming some of the disadvantages of physical handicap. The rates of birth and death in the Borough remain more or less constant from year to year. The increase in the birth rate which followed World War II and then declined has to some extent been restored though in this district it remains at a level considerably below that of the national figure. This is no doubt a reflection upon the percentage of residents of child-bearing age when compared with the country as a whole. It is interesting to note that of the deaths registered during the year were of persons of 80 or more years of age and that of 178 deaths in this group only 43 were males compared with 135 females. In the tables and comment which follow will be found a summary of statistics relating to these and other matters, while the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector presents a summary of the extensive routine visiting and sampling which is carried out in the Borough by his staff. Such vigilance continues to be necessary and indeed the routine work of the Inspectors increases with each successive year. (3) In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the interest and support of members of the Public Health Committee and Council during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. (4) PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OP INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis Immunisation against Poliomyelitis has now taken its place as a routine procedure for infants alongside the well established protective injections against smallpox, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. Supplies of Salk vaccine were unfortunately curtailed towards the end of the year and some injections had to be postponed, Protection against Poliomyelitis continues to be offered to all persons between 6 months and 40 years of age and to certain others over this age at the discretion of family doctors. It is important that each course of injections should be completed if protection is to be effective. Despite continuous efforts to remind them there are some people of all ages who are inadequately protected because they have failed to have the number of doses advised. One case of Paralytic Poliomyelitis was notified during 1961 . This was a child who was infected from an unknown source and who made a good recovery with little residual handicap. Diphtheria The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year: Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 614, school 121) 735 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 1,586 For the 14th year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 10. No deaths occurred. (5) Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. 637 children were immunised during the year and 365 received a reinforcing dose. Tetanus Inoculation against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted. Although not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 541 children were immunised during the year and 406 received a reinforcing dose. No cases were notified. Smallpox Vaccination Vaccinations 451 Revaccinations 89 540 Of the above, 274 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 388 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate time. The percentage of infants tinder 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 72 As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 19j giving an incidence rate of 0.41 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild. (6) Measles There was an extensive epidemic of Measles during the first half of the year, 810 cases being notified. There were no deaths recorded from this disease. Dysentery There was a marked reduction in the number of cases of Sonne Dysentery notified, only two cases during the year compared with thirteen in the previous year. This may or may not be a true indication of the prevalence of this infection since many of the cases are so mild that bacteriological investigation is not considered to be necessary. The illness is nevertheless responsible for significant loss of school time among affected children and contacts, rigid methods of control being necessary to prevent epidemic spread. Food Poisoning Twenty-four incidents of suspected food poisoning were reported to the department and in only two cases was the diagnosis confirmed after detailed investigation. One of these was found to be caused by staphylococcus aureus and the other by salmonella typhi-murium. The resident who was suffering from food poisoning due to staphylococcus aureus toxin had eaten some infected cheese outside the district. In the case of the patient suffering from Salmonella typhi-muriun infection it was suspected he had consumed infected food at a London Exhibition where he was employed. It was not, however, possible to confirm this bacteriologically. Notification was received from another district concerning a person who had visited the Borough and was later discovered to be suffering from Para-typhoid fever, A thorough investigation was carried out into the possibility of infection having been contracted in the Borough, but no source was discovered. A child from a Residential Home was admitted to a local Isolation Hospital suffering from Measles and was found later to be infected with Salmonella Typhi-murium. Investigation at the Home revealed no further cases, but one case of Sonne Dysentery was discovered. The necessity for scrupulous attention to the cleanliness and soundness of food cannot be over emphasised. If the possibility of food borne infection is to be minimised such matters as hand washing by persons handling food and the absolute prohibition of re-heated meat dishes are vitally important. (7) Non-notifiable Diseases Head teachers of Local Education Authority schools notify cases of non-notifiable disease occurring in their schools. This is a useful procedure which is much appreciated. German Measles and Chickenpox were the two most prevalent during the year.

At the end of the year the following numbers of cases were suffering from the disease and living in the district, the total being 12 more than the previous year. Pulmonary Males 101 4 Females 81 8 MORTUAHY The Council's mortuary is still closed and the arrangements continued with the Wimbledon Borough Council for bodies to be received in the mortuary at Gap Road, Wimbledon. 36 bodies were received in the mortuary. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT , 1948 Section 47. It was not necessary to take action under this Act for the removal to hospital of any case during the year. Preventive work is constantly carried out for old people brought to the notice of the Public Health Department as being possibly in need of care and attention. In all cases it was found possible to maintain the old people either in their own homes with the help of the various Statutory and Voluntary Services available, or by gaining their voluntary admission to hospital or to County Welfare Homes.

July, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my first Annual Report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1961. The vacant post of Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector was filled in March by the appointment of Mr. W. G„ Coker who was with the County Borough of Croydon. In the same month Mr, E. E. Jenner returned to work after his long illness. Mr. C„ J. Wapshere secured an appointment as Pupil Public Health Inspector with Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council and the vacancy was filled by Miss N. M„ Porch who had been with the National Health Service. Following the Council's review of staffing the establishment of the department was increased by the appointment of Mr. B. Cova as Pupil Public Health Inspector. The position of Additional Public Health Inspector remained unfilled at the end of the year. Following the improved staffing situation it was possible to make progress in the establishment of smoke control areas with the result that No.1. Smoke Control Order was made and confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the No„2. Order was made during the year. These Orders were confirmed without appeals being submitted and it is noteworthy that most members of the general public are anxious to live in smoke control areas. No effort has been spared to explain the need for such measures and the co-operation which the Council is now receiving from all concerned indicates the value of the public relations aspect of this work. (19) The Council is represented on the Standing Conference of Cooperating Bodies - The national organisation sponsored by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research concerned with measurement and prevention of atmospheric pollution. Early in the year Councillor Isitt, B.Sc. was appointed the Council's representative -with me, following the untimely death of Councillor D. G. Allen, B.Sc. , F.R.I.C. , J.P. In September the Couusil celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the granting of the Charter with numerous activities including an exhibition of the work of the Council. The opportunity was taken by the Public Health Department to illustrate various facets of its work which included immunisation, clean food, insect pests, rodent control, old peoples welfare, improvement grants and clean air. A great deal of material was borrowed and the CourKsil was greatly indebted to the Ministries of Health, Housing and Local Government and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Gas, Electricity and Water Boards, the Coal Utilisation Council, the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, the National Society for Clean Air and many other organisations. There was a very good attendance by the public -who showed great interest in the work of this and other departments. A survey of the sewers throughout the Borough revealed no evidence of vermin and is a welcome indication of the efficiency of the eradication measures vhich are taken to deal with surface infestation. Householders are invited to avail themselves of the free service available to them if they will immediately notify the department of the presence of rats. Although the Offices Act, 1960, was due to come into operation on the 1st January, 1962, no regulations have been introduced which would make the Act effective. The Public Health Act of 1961 introduces legislation -which was previously contained in local Acts and provides for the making of Building Regulations which will replace Building Byelaws. The Housing Act, 1961, deals with various aspects of local authority housing and an important provision enables landlords who improve their property by means of an Improvement Grant to raise the rent by 124^ of the expenditure incurred by them in carrying out the improvements. It is to be hoped that this incentive will encourage more property owners to take advantage of the generous grants available to then. The past year has emphasised the need for constant vigilance in all matters appertaining to the health of the community. The hazard of radiation and contamination of food supplies is a potential public health problem and by the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge of this subject the public health inspector has an important part to play. (20) I desire to express my appreciation to the Members of the Council for their support and interest, to Dr. Westcombe for his encouragement, the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyalty and the staff of other departments for their co-operation. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. E. KINTON. Chief Public Health Inspector. (21) HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year - (a)by the Council 2.2 (b) by private enterprise 43 Number of houses in course of construction - (a) by the Council 11 (b) by private enterprise 107 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary 22 Abatement 12 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the district. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, provides for local authorities to make grants to owners for improvement of their property. There are two types of grant available, the 'Standard' and the 'Discretionary' grant. The 'Standard Grant' is available for the cost of installing a bath, water closet in or readily accessible from within the building, hot water system, wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food in a dwelling without one or more of these facilities. Subject to the dwelling being likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant having a freehold or leasehold interest, of which not less than 15 years remain unexpired, the local authority must approve a grant. The maximum amount of 'Standard Grant' which is 50% of the cost of carrying out the work, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows: (22) Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom £25 Wash hand basin £5 Hot water supply £75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling£40 Satisfactory facilities for storing food £10 On completion, the dwelling must possess all the amenities. The Council has continued to give 'Discretionary Grants' for works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of £800 and subject to a grant up to 50% of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given where extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. The Housing Act, 1961, came into operation in October, 1961 and authorised an increase in the rent by 12½% of the cost incurred by the owner in carrying out the improvements made to property. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. Although many did not avail themselves of the facilities offered a considerable amount of work has been carried out. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year; Standard Grants. APPLICATIONS Received. (No. of dwellings). Approved. (No. of dwellings).

The Council approved an application by the Maiden and Coombe Housing Society Ltd. of the Maiden and Coombe Old People's Welfare Association for the conversion of 11, Thetford Road, New Maiden, into 9 flatlets for old people, together with accommodation for a house mother. The work was virtually completed by the end of the year and some of the flatlets were occupied by the 31st December, 1961. The cost of improvement works was £4,702. 7. 0., a 50% grant of £2,351.3.6. being authorised. A further grant was made by the Council under the provisions of Section 119 of the Housing Act, 1957, of £2,351. 3. 6. This is the third conversion of this type carried out by the Association and provides excellent accommodation for old people. The rentals are fixed to cover the estimated annual expenditure without showing a profit and the tenants are enabled to maintain their independence which is so important to the elderly.

DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following disinfections were carried out: After infectious disease 4 rooms 8 bags of clothing were disinfected. 24 rooms were disinfested for insect peats. 2 ponds were treated for mosquitoes. 2 loads of bedding were destroyed. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. Inspections were made but it was not necessary to take any action during the year. (25) FOOD AM) DRUGS ACT. 1955 During the year 156 samples were submitted to the Council's Public Analyst, Mr. D. D. Moir, M.Sc., F.R.I.C., 16, Southwark Street, S.E.1 . whose expert advice is gratefully acknowledged. The samples have been selected from a wide range of commodities, most of which were found to be genuine.

A sample of cod roe was found to contain added salt which was not specified on the label. The canners undertook to amend their labels when reprinting. Canned Cherries. 'Canned Cherries in heavy syrup' were found to be packed in 'syrup' and the manufacturers agreed to delete the word 'heavy' from the label describing this product. Blackcurrant Health Drink. On analysis an informal sample of fruit drink was found to be 22% deficient in ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and a subsequent formal sample proved to be genuine. The investigations by the retailer and manufacturers failed to prove conclusively the reason for the unsatisfactory result of the first sample analysed. Beverage. A beverage bearing a label which described the contents as containing sucrose was sampled. Although 'sucrose' is a specific chemical name for the article which is commonly known simply as sugar, it is not one which would indicate to the ordinary purchaser the true nature of this ingredient and the manufacturers attention was drawn to this irregularity. (28) High Protein Bread. A sample of high protein bread was examined and found to contain 19.6 % protein, whereas the recommended standard for bread described as 'high' protein should not be less than 22%. As the Pood Standards Committee was considering the Regulations regarding Bread and Flour, the Council decided to refer the relevant correspondence to that Committee for consideration when making the standard for this product. MILK During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960: Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licence. Tuberculin tested 8 Pasteurised 16 Sterilised 8 Milk Bottles. Numerous complaints were received concerning the external condition of milk bottles delivered by a dairy company. Representations were made by the Council and members and officials of the Council visited the processing and bottling depot to see for themselves the conditions under which bottles were filled. The defective bottles were discarded and preventive measures taken to prevent a recurrence of this complaint. Dirty Milk Bottles. On two occasions a dairy company was fined for selling in this district a dirty bottle of milk which had been filled at a London depot. Fines of £5 with 2 gns. costs and £30 with 2 gns. costs were imposed. DETAILS OF MILK TESTING CLASS OF MILK NUMBER OF SAMPLES TESTED APPROPRIATE TESTS NUMBER OF SAMPLES PASSED FAILED VOID Pasteurised 37 Phosphatase 37 — — Methylene blue 32 1 4 Sterilised 4 Turbidity 4 — — Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 22 Phosphatase 22 - - Methylene blue 20 1 1 Tuberculin tested (Raw) 3 Methylene blue 3 - - Tuberculin tested (Farm Bottled) 4 Biological 4 - - (29) The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. The dairy company concerned in the supply of the two samples which failed to satisfy the methylene blue test took immediate steps to prevent a recurrence which was due to long storage. FOOD There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business together with the number of inspections. Food Premises No. in District No. of Inspections Made Bakehouses 5 29 Bakers shops 15 40 Butchers 20 41 Confectioners 29 40 Cooked meat shops 2 2 Fish shops (wet or fried) 12 22 Greengrocers 23 26 Greengrocers stalls 2 5 Grocers (including off-licences) 54 75 Institutions 17 7 Office and works canteens 15 13 Public houses and hotels 12 9 Restaurants and cafes 15 23 School canteens 14 17 Clubs, sports etc 18 12 253 361 The following premises are registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the purposes listed.

(31) FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year a number of complaints were received about foods sold in the district, all of which were investigated. Sardine and Tomato Fish Paste. A complaint regarding the condition of this paste was exhaustively investigated by the staff of the laboratories of both the Public Analyst and the manufacturers concerned and the only organism which could be found to account for the abnormal condition was Clostridium histolyticum. Tinned Corned Beef. A complaint was received from a member of the public concerning the abnormal appearance of corned beef in a tin and this was investigated at the laboratories of the canners and the condition was found to be due to sulphide of iron. Wire in Bread. The Council decided to prosecute where the purchaser found wire inside a loaf of bread and the magistrates found the retailer not guilty. It was not possible to proceed against the manufacturers, but subsequently a successful private action was taken by the retailer. Red Salmon. The purchaser of a tin of red salmon was concerned to find what appeared to be crystals of glass in the fish, but it was explained that this is a common occurrence, the condition being due to a substance known as struvite. Foreign Body in Butter. A complaint was received concerning a rubber band found in a packet of butter which had been imported from Denmark. The purchase took place outside the district and it was dealt with by an adjoining Authority. The manufacturers took immediate steps to prevent a recurrence, the rubber band being a washer from part of the processing machinery. Chocolate infested with maggots. A trader was warned of the serious consequences of selling a bar of chocolate infested with maggots, a condition arising from long storage of a product. Foreign matter in Bread. The Council prosecuted the manufacturers of a loaf of bread containing dirt and the magistrates imposed a fine of £30 with 5 gns. costs. Complaints concerning cockles, smoked cod roe, rock salmon and canned pear's were investigated during the year. ICE CREAM Fifty-seven samples were submitted to the methylene blue test. (32) The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample,, Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade I, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947:- Year Samples Taken Grades I or II % Grade III % Grade IV % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 - 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 - 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 - 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 - 1957 54 54 100.0 0 - 0 - 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 - 1959 38 38 100.0 0 - 0 — 1960 46 46 100.0 0 — 0 — 1961 58 57 98.3 1 1.7 0 - HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT. 1952 This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year and advice was given to traders dealing in second-hand appliances. (33) RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a whole sale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report on each. PET ANIMALS ACT. 1951 This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT. 1950 There are 372 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. During the year there has been one development of particular interest - the desire to adopt a five day week for shop assistants. In this Borough there is an Order which requires hairdressers and barbers to close for the half day on Wednesday or Saturday, but other shops are permitted to close for the half day on whichever day they choose. It has been customary for the majority of shops to close on Wednesday afternoon. One provision merchant's shop closes on Mondays and is open to the public all day on Wednesday. The views of hairdressers and barbers were sought regarding a similar change, but at that time there was no majority in favour of amending the existing Order. REFUSE TIP AM) REFUSE DISPOSAL Refuse from the area is collected under the direction of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and transported to a loading bay operated (34) jointly by this Council, the Royal Borough of Kingston-npon-Thames and the Borough of Surbiton. Prom the loading bay the refuse is conveyed by contractors to disused gravel pits at Egham. The controlled tip adjoining Green Lane School at Worcester Park is now in use as playing fields. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The work of destroying rats and mice continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises, many of which are on annual service agreements. The Borough river boundaries, depots, refuse tips, piggeries and open spaces together with the premises of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board have received constant attention. 10% of the sewers of the Borough were baited and no evidence of infestation was found. Workable Area Committee meetings sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood were held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of pest control were discussed. INSECT PESTS As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests. Nuisance was experienced from wasps during the summer and the department gave all possible assistance and advice. 107 wasp nests were destroyed and the cost of the work was recovered from the occupiers of the premises. 18 rooms were treated for infestations of bugs and 2 rooms for fleas. 72 council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council eight school kitchens and canteens were sprayed with a residual insecticide as a deterrent against insect infestation. (35) CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough and no licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. RAINFALL The following table shows the rainfall in the district during 1961, taken at the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board works, Kingston Vale and Manor Park.

In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. (36) RIVERS AND STREAMS The river Hogsmill and the Beverley brook, which flow into the river Thames, provide much of the western and eastern boundaries of the district. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE With the exception of a small quantity which is discharged to the sewage disposal works of the Borough of Sutton and Cheam at Worcester Park and to the Wandle Valley Joint Sewage Board, the sewage of the district is treated at the modern works of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board, situated within the Borough. CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas. Considerable progress was made during the year in connection with the establishment of Smoke Control Areas. By May, the survey of No. 1 Area had been completed and an Order was made for the Coombe Hill Area bounded by Kingston Hill, Kingston Vale, Beverley Brook, Coombe Hill Road, Coombe Lane West and Warren Road, covering 496 acres and 959 dwellings, 30 commercial premises and 18 other premises. No appeals were received and the Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government to come into operation on the 1st October, 1962. By September, the surveying of No. 2 Area was finished. This area, the Maiden Golf Course area, is bounded by Coombe Hill Road, Beverley Brook, Main Railway line, Coombe Road and Traps Lane, covers 326 acres, 611 dwellings, 35 commercial, 5 industrial and 6 other premises. No appeals were received and the Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government early in 1962, to commence on the 1st October, 1962. •* The survey of No. 3 Area, the Maiden Hill Area bounded by the Main Railway line, Beverley Brook, Maiden Way, Maiden Road, was commenced during the year. The Council considered the programme for further Smoke Control Areas and it was decided to deal with the following areas between 1964 and 1966: Area No. 4. Motspur Park area bounded by Maiden Way, Beverley Brook, railway lines Motspur Park to Worcester Park and Maiden Manor, and Maiden Road. (37) Area No. 5. Worcester Park area bounded by railway lines Motspur Park to Worcester Park and Beverley Brook. Area Mo. 6. Maiden Green area, bounded by Railway lines Motspur Park to Worcester Park, Borough boundary with Boroughs of Sutton and Cheam and Epsom and Ewell, Hogsmill River, and railway lines Motspur Park to Maiden Manor. Area No. 7. Kingston Hill area hounded by Borough boundary with Borough of Richmond at rear of Kingston Hill, Warren Road, Coombe Lane West and boundary with Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames. Clean Air Act. 1955. Seven notices of intention to instal furnaces with a rating exceeding 55,000 British thermal units or more per hour were received. During the year 151 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement. Atmospheric Pollution - Recording. The following tables show the daily average, and highest and lowest concentrations of smoke expressed in milligrammes per 100 cubic metres and sulphur dioxide concentration as parts per 100 million volumes of air for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961 recorded at New Maiden and Kingston Vale.

The Act provides that a complaint of the existence of a nuisance may be made by three or more persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premises and in that capacity is aggrieved by the nuisance. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration from aircraft and in proceedings it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been adopted for preventing the nuisance.
