To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Seventh Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year 1907. The report deals with the 52 weeks beginning December 29th, 1906, and ending December 28th, 1907. The death rate was 18.3, compared with 19.7 in 1906 and 18.6 in 1905. This is the lowest death rate as yet recorded in Bermondsey. No serious outbreaks of infectious disease occurred during the year, but the mild type of scarlet fever mentioned in the last report still continued very prevalent. There was a slight decrease in diphtheria. The sections of the report are, as usual, divided into:— I. —Vital Statistics. II.—Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.—Sanitary Administration. IV. —Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. Again I may record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordiality and co-operation throughout the year. Thanks are also due to the members of the staff for their hearty co-operation in carrying out the various duties devolving on the Public Health Department. I am, gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R.K.BROWN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The populations of the Borough of Bermondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1891, 1896 and 1901, and the estimate for the year under report are as follow : — 1891. 1896. 1901. Estimate, 1907. Bermondsey 84,682 85,475 82,483 81,610 Rotherhithe 39,225 40,379 38,460 38,197 St. Olave's 12,723 11,731 9,817 8,049 Borough 136,660 137,585 130,760 127,856 The estimate of the population in Bermondsey for 1907 shows a still further decrease from the Census of 1901. At this distance from the last Census it is very difficult to give an accurate estimate, but, apart from the replacing of small houses by warehouses, the number of empty houses would seem to point to a decrease. The latter circumstance is probably entirely due to the increased facilities of transit leading to a tendency on the part of the population of this as well as other central boroughs to go to seek residences further out. The same method of estimating has been adopted as that employed in former years. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended December 28th, 1907, was 4013, consisting of 1,992 males and 2,021 females. This is 410 below the average for the last 10 years, and 18 below the figure for 1906. This total includes 2.674 for Bermondsey, being 9 below that for 1906, and 232 below the average for the last 10 years ; 1,110 for Rotherhithe, being 21 above the number for 1906, and 71 below the average for the last 10 years, and 229 for St. Olave's, being 30 below the number for 1906 and 107 below the average for the last 10 years. Note.—This reduction of births in St. Olave's is due to our being able to allocate births in Parish Street Workhouse to their proper districts. In Table II. of the appendix will be seen the figures for the last ten years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth rate for 1907 was 31.4 per thousand persons living, which is 2.3 below the average for the last 10 years. Particulars of rates will be found in annexed Table A. London is included for comparison. A new departure with regard to births was made by the Registrar-General in 1906. The births are corrected by distributing those which occurred in the chief lying-in hospitals of the Metropolis to the Boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission. Those allocated to Bermondsey in 1907 number 41, and if they are added to the above total the rate will be 31.7. Table A—Birth Rates. Year. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave's. Whole Borough.

Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1907 was 1,147, being 48 above the number for 1906, and equal to the average for the last 10 years. In Table VIII. of the Appendix will be found particulars of numbers and rates in the three registration sub-districts. The numbers have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. Deaths. In Table IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. No alteration has been made by the Board in the Table of Infantile Mortality. The extended table of causes of death initiated in 1904 will also be found in the Appendix. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1907, was 1856, which is 123 less than in 1906, and 455 less than the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of non-parishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2338. This is 191 less than in 1906, and 394 less than the average for the last 10 years. The annexed table shows the distribution of deaths in Quarters, together with the corresponding Quarters of 1906. Much the largest number of deaths occurred in the first Quarter of the year as compared with the last Quarter of the year in the previous two years. This, however, may be considered a normal occurrence. 5 Table B.—Deaths. Quarter. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave's.

If the Census population be taken as the basis of calculation of the rate it works out at 17.9, which is 1.4 below that for 1906. Table C—Death Rates. Year. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave's.

Respiratory diseases and premature birth are Ihe principal items in the increase, whereas the chief cause of the decrease is the diminished number of deaths from Summer diarrhoea. In column 1, foot of Table I. of the Appendix, will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the district. There were 25 such deaths in all, against 20 in 1906, and 33 in 1905. 7 such deaths occurred in the Infirmary; 11 in River Thames and Docks; 1 on railway ; 1 on Rotherhithe Tunnel Works; 3 in street; 1 in South Wharf and 1 in Tower Bridge Police Station. 507 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 570 in 1906, and 521 in 1905. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred wili he found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix.

"The age and sex distribution of the population of England and Wales being taken as a standard to all communities within their borders, the death rates of different localities can be calculated on the assumption that they have the same proportions of children under 5. old people and women, as have the population of England and Wales. By thus eliminating this disturbing factor of age and sex distribution different communities can he brought into strict comparison with one another "In 1888 the Registrar-General commenced a method of correcting the death rates of the great towns of England and Wales Taking account of the differences of age and sex distribution between these and the latter, he has calculated a factor for each great town by which the recorded death rate must be multiplied so as to allow for the differences of age and sex, and thus places them as regards these matters on an equal footing. You thus get death rates, the difference in which can be put down to general sanitary conditions alone. In illustration of this I have taken the above figures from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for 190S, to form table E. "It will be seen from this that in London and the Boroughs the correction raises the death rate, showing that there is in them a preponderance of people living at ages when the death rate is low (viz., between 5 and 50), and also of women, sufficient to keep the recorded death rate down, notwithstanding the great number of children under 5."

This can be largely explained by the summer being much colder and somewhat wetter than the summer of 1906. Apropos of this the following remarks are quoted from the report oil the metropolitan water supply for December, 1907: — The year 1907 will be remembered less for its beautiful Easter and delightful September than for its cold, wet and inclement summer. The remarkably high and low barometric readings in January and February respectively, the June like weather in March, the fall of snow in April and late in June, the low temperature (seven degrees below the average) in May, the inclemency of the weather in July and August, the wet and unpleasant month of October and the dull, mild and foggy month of November, are matters of interest, if chiefly of a depressing kind. As regards the rainfall, the following remarks by Dr. Hugh Robert Mill are of great interest (p. 230, Symons's Meteorological Magazine, No. 504, Vol. 42): — The general rainfall for the whole of the British Isles comes out as 1 per cent. above the average, which for all practical purposes may be taken as the average, exactly the same as in 1906. The year 1906 was generally considered to be dry and fine, because the holiday months were dry, and 1907 has generally been stigmatised as wet and wretched, probably because in most parts of the country, as in London, there were a great many days with rain, and, perhaps, because a larger proportion of the rain than is usual fell in the daylight hours. Both years, however, practically coincided with the average, a result that has never previously been recorded. While there is no doubt that the meteorological conditions of the year under report were favourable to infantile life, they will scarcely explain the whole reduction. The principal share in this was due to the fewer deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis. This decrease is very satisfactory as far as it goes, but one cannot help feeling that it may be of a more or less temporary character, since an examination of Table F. shows that there has been a considerable amount of fluctuation during the last ten years. London itself shows a considerable decrease, so that Bermondsey still retains the position of showing a much higher infantile mortality than that of the Metropolis. As remarked above, diarrhoea accounts for the largest reduction, as there was only one-third of the number of deaths which occurred in the previous year. There is also a reduction under the heading of "Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus," also in pneumonia, and smaller reductions in many other causes of death. There is, however, a considerable increase in the number of deaths due to premature birth and congenital defects, the figures being for 1906, 74, and for 1907, 105. There is no doubt that in London generally, and to some extent in Bermondsey, the recent propagandism regarding the proper method of infantile feeding may be beginning to have some effect. One is certainly tempted to hope so; and should a low infantile mortality continue in spite of varying meteorological conditions, one will be quite safe in coming to the conclusion that our efforts have not been in vain. The very fact of the fall from a high infantile mortality in 1906 to a comparatively low one in 1907 being so large and so sudden makes one suspicious that it is mainly, if not entirely due to some cause over which we have no control, such as the weather, rather than to any alteration in the habits of the people. The customs and ignorance of generations are not going to be overcome in a single year, and it will take many years of training before the mothers of the poorer classes have acquired a sufficient knowledge of the hygiene of child life to produce a marked and permanent lowering of the infantile mortality. I hope to see before very long a permanent and still greater reduction, but much requires to be done before we arrive at that stage. 9 During the past year cards on infant feeding have been supplied to all mothers in this Borough, but owing to the lateness of registration the majority do not receive them until six months after the birth. An endeavour has been made on the part of the Legislature to remedy this by the passing of the Notification of Births Act. This is an adoptive Act, and the necessary steps to put it in force were taken by this Council in October 1907. We have not, however, received the sanction of the Local Government Board, probably because beyond the sending of infant feeding cards we have no machinery for visiting the children's homes or giving instructions and advice on the care of infants. The industrial conditions in Bermondsey preclude young mothers from acquiring a proper knowledge of household and motherly duties prior to marriage. As soon as they have left school their first anxiety is to make money, the result being that in the five or ten years following their dismissal from school they are engaged all day in some factorv or workshop and are disinclined to acquire any other knowledge. As a consequence, on marriage they are entirely ignorant of the responsibilities which it brings, with the most disastrous results to their families, if they ever have any. To remedy this state of affairs instruction in hygiene should begin during the last year of a girl's school life and continue more or less till the marriageable age. After marriage instruction should be given prior to and subsequent to the birth of the child, and this is specially important in the case of the first child. In the case of the better classes who can afford a medical attendant, the duty of instruction is naturally undertaken by the latter, but in the case of the poorer class this work can best be done by the sanitary authority through the ministrations of a health visitor. Where saving of life is concerned the authority should not hesitate on the score of expense, for, apart from humanitarian reasons, every healthy life is an asset to the community. There are still a considerable number of children who escape vaccination, and the possibility of receiving any instructions by false addresses and other reasons as detailed in the following table:— False address given.

This gives a zymotic death rate of l.74. The total number of deaths trom notifiable diseases, viz., scarlet fever, diphtheria and enteric fever was 65 compared with 68 in 1906, and for the non-notifiable, viz., measles, whooping cough and diarrhoea, 158, compared with 332 in the previous year. The reduction is entirefy due to decreases in the deaths from measles, from 94 to 51, and diarrhoea, from 188 to 55. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths over 65 years of age in 1907 was 518, compared with 473 in 1906. Death Certification. There were no uncertified deaths in 1907. Diarrhoea. As already mentioned, there has been a remarkable decrease in the deaths from diarrhoea. Table H. will show the contrast between the two years, and also the connection between the meteorological conditions and deaths (vide remarks on 8). The second table still emphasises that the most important factor in the prevention of diarrhcea is undoubtedly breast feeding If young children are breast fed and given reasonable care, their chances of liie are four or five times as great as children artificially fed even when this is done under favourable conditions.

There were no deaths from this cause in 1907. Measles. There were 51 deaths due to this, disease, which is 44 below the average for the last ten years, and 43 below the number for 1906. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows, viz.:—2l, 21, 5, 4. Whooping Cough. 52 deaths were due to this cause, against 50 in 1906: of these, 18 occurred in the first quarter, 24, 7 and 3 in the other quarters respectively. Typhus Fever. There were no deaths from this cause in 1907. Enteric Fever. 7 deaths were due to this cause:—3 in Bermondsey and 4 in Rotherhithe. The corresponding figures for 1906 were 4 for the Borough, viz., 2 in Bermondsey and 2 in Rotherhithe. Other Allied Diseases. 7 deaths were registered under this heading, one a child of nine months from chickenpox, and another, a child of six months, from German measles. There were also 5 deaths from cerebro-spinal meningitis. In the case of the first two, death was not directly due to either of these two complaints but to complications which occurred in the course of the disease, viz., broncho-pneumonia in the German measles case and oedema of the glottis in the case of the patient who had chicken-pox. An account of the cerebro-spinal meningitis will be found in the section of my report dealing with the notification of that disease. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular diseases in 1907 was 334, against 345 in 1906. This figure comprises 216 for Bermondsey, 95 for Rotherhithe, and 23 for St. Olave's. Of these, 237 were due to phthisis, and 97 to the other tubercular diseases. Phthisis. In Table J. will be found particulars of deaths from phthisis since the year 1897. There were 237 deaths due to this cause, which is a decrease of 13 over 1906. Table J—Phthisis. ROTHERHITHE. ST. OLAVE'S. WHOLE BOROUGH. LONDON. SUB-DISTRICT. BERMONDSEY. No. Rate. Rate. Year.

This number gives a very small idea of the deaths caused by these diseases, since they are often the remote causes of death and are not always mentioned on the certificate for various reasons. Cancer. 126 deaths were attributed to this cause, 114 being due to carcinoma, or cancer, as ordinarily understood, and 12 to sarcoma. This increase, as mentioned in last year's report, is not surprising, considering that the average life is longer, and more people now reach old age than formerly, in which period of life they are more prone to suffer from this disease. The Cancer Research Commission have not yet issued their final report on the subject. 12 Table K—Cancer. Deaths during 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907. All ages 15 to 20. 35 to 45. 85 & upwards.

This refers to organic or valvular disease of the heart. Suicides. 11 persons committed suicide in 1907, viz., 2 by poison, '2 by hanging or strangulation, 2 by drowning, 1 by shooting, and 4 by cut or stab. Accidents. 84 deaths were due to accidents, against 111 in the previous year. Particulars will be found in the extended table of the Causes of Death in the Appendix. Other Violent Causes. There were two deaths by homicide caused by cutting the throat (child aged 3 and girl aged 18). II.—NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In Table III. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified was 1530, compared with 1536 in 1906, and 1139 in 1905. The diseases which show an increase on the numbers for the previous year are : —scarlet, fever (46), enteric fever (3), puerperal fever (3), and cerebro-spinal meningitis (7), while those showing a decrease are smallpox (]), diphtheria (19), erysipelas (43) and typhus fever (2). The number of cases notified in the registration sub-districts was 1023 in Bermondsey against 937 in 1906, 410 in Rotherhithe against 454, and 97 in St. Olave's against 145 in 1906. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 12.0, the rate for the sub-districts being 12.5 for Bermondsey, 10.7 for Rotherhithe, and 12.0 for St. Olave's. The corresponding rates in the previous year were 12.0 for the Borough, 11.4 for Bermondsey, 11.9 for Rotherhithe, and 17.4 for St. Olave's. 71 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, bat if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of cases. Small-pox. There were no cases of smallpox notified during 1907. Typhus Fever. No cases of this disease were notified during the year under report. Diphtheria. There were 311 cases of diphtheria notified in 1907. of which 209 occurred in Bermondsey, 80 in Rotherhithe and 22 in St. Olave's. This is a decrease on 1906, for which the figures DIPHTHERIA. Average 7 years, 1901—1907, Marked Green. Notifications, 1907, marked Red. were: — Borough, 327 ; Bermondsey, 210 ; Rotherhithe, 72, and St. Olave's, 45. This is satisfactory, since, while diphtheria has increased in London generally, in Bermondsey there is a decrease. Year. London.

The case mortality was 7.1 per cent. against 10.3 per cent. in 1906, and 10.9 per cent. in 1905. 37 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. 257 specimens were sent in by medical practitioners for bacteriological examination against 226 in 1906, and 108 in 1905. Of these 70 were found to contain diphtheria bacilli, and 6 cases returned not suffering. In 18 cases of diphtheria the source of infection was attributed as follows : — Previous cases in house or family 15 From friends (visiting) 2 School infection 1 Diphtheria is a disease caused by a characteristic bacillus known as the Klebs Loeffler Bacillus which occurs in the throats of persons attacked by the disease. It seems to be conveyed from person to person by direct contact, and there is no virulent disease which will spread more rapidly under certain circumstances than this will among school children. It is more or less directly conveyed from throat to throat by children passing sweets, slate pencils, and other articles which they are liable to put in their mouths, from one child to another. Kissing an affected person on the mouth will also frequently give rise to the disease, and an infected child coughing in the neighbourhood of non-infected ones will also often transmit the disease to them. Sometimes the bacilli will exist in the throat for a long time without producing any symptoms, but such children while not suffering themselves will be liable to convey the infection to others. For this reason they have been called " Carrier " cases, and as expressed in previous reports my belief is that a large part of the spread of the disease is due to such cases. Since 1902 an endeavour has been made in this Borough to prevent any of these " Carrier " cases returning to school, and each Annual report has contained some account of the working of the plan. This consists in getting the parents of a child which is notified as suffering from diphtheria to bring up the other members of the family within a week or so after the removal or recovery of (he case to the municipal laboratory at the Town Hall for examination. If diphtheria bacilli are found in the throats they are excluded from school for a fortnight, and if then found to be free, are allowed to return to school. The number of children thus examined in 1907 was 437, belonging to 186 families. Out of this number 51 had diphtheria bacilli in their throats or noses, and of these 17 subsequently developed the clinical symptoms of diphtheria and were notified as such. One case which was returned from hospital as not suffering from this disease deserves special mention, and the following report was made to the Public Health Committee on 12th November : — On Monday, the 21st ult., I received a notification from Guy's Hospital that Joseph Baker, aged 31, of 48, Bermondsey Wall, was suffering from diphtheria. Upon enquiry it was found that he attended the hospital late Saturday, 19th ult., and was found to be suffering from a rather severe diphtheritic throat. A swab was not taken for bacteriological examination; but since the symptoms warranted his immediate removal, an ambulance was sent for, and he was sent to the Park Hospital about 9 p.m. He seems to have been detained there long enough to be examined, and was then returned home as not suffering from diphtheria, arriving at his home about 12.30 a.m. On Tuesday, the 22nd, there was some difficulty in getting hold of the man for me to examine, since he considered he had no infectious disease, and did not trouble to remain in the house. However, he seems to have been sufficiently ill on the Wednesday to take the advice of the Inspector and come up to see me at the Laboratory, when I found he had marked clinical symptoms of diphtheria in his throat, a very weak pulse and every sign of being seriously ill. As he had been returned from the Park Hospital as not having this disease I naturally hesitated about sending him off immediately, so I took a swab from his throat, and the following morning found very typical diphtheria bacilli present; but to make certain I sent the specimens to Dr. Eyre for confirmation, which he immediately gave me. I then notified the case and had the patient removed to Park Hospital the same day, and he is still there. In proportion to the notifications there have been more cases of diphtheria returned from this particular Hospital as " not suffering " than any of the others, many of which have been certified as having the disease upon a bacteriological diagnosis. The facts were communicated to the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, who replied that the subject had been investigated by a sub-committee who had considered a report which they had received from the Medical Superintendent of the hospital, in which he stated that the patient did not have diphtheria, but was suffering from a chronic ailment which yielded to proper treatment. With this diagnosis I did not at all agree. There are several points in connection with the case which are explained in the following letter sent by the Public Health Committee to the Metropolitan Asylums Board : — Diphtheria Patient—Joseph Baker. Your letter of the '23rd inst. upon the above subject was submitted to the Public Health Committee at their meeting last evening, and 1 am directed to inform you that the Committee are not satisfied with the explanation contained in your letter " that in Dr. Birdwood's opinion this patient did not have diphtheria but that he was suffering from a chronic ailment that yielded to appropriate treatment." lam to remind the Board that although the case was in the first instance notified from Guy's Hospital and not by an ordinary private practitioner, the patient was returned to his home almost at once and when it was practically impossible for any proper careful diagnosis of the case to have been made. The return was aggravated by being made at midnight when the patient was seriously ill. On the second occasion, when the case was notified —i.e., within 5 days of being returned —by the Council's Medical Officer, supported by Dr. Eyre, of Guy's Hospital, the patient was retained for three weeks, although, according to Dr. Birdwood, he was not suffering from an infectious disease and had no right to be in the Board's hospital. I am further to call the Board's attention to these facts: that although the case was notified from Guy's Hospital and by the Council's Medical Officer, the usual notification that the patient was not suffering as certified was not sent to either of the certifying doctors nor was any such notification sent to the Medical Officer of Health; on the 12th November, however, the usual notice was received that the patient would be discharged on the 14th November as cured, presumably of the disease for which he was notified. This Committee will be glad to receive some better explanation. In further correspondence the Board declined to give any better explanation, so the Committee gave instructions that the whole correspondence and facts should be laid before the Local Government Board for their investigation. No reply has, so far, been received from them. Scarlet fever. There were 1023 notifications of scarlet fever—697 for Bermondsey, 262 for Rotherhithe and 64 for St. Olave's. This is an increase of 46 for the Borough on the total for 1006. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table 111. of Appendix, was fairly uniform. 30 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scerlet fever. This may be considered very satisfactory considering the mildness of the type and the increased number of cases notified. The accompanying chart shows the prevalence of the disease in each of the 52 weeks under report. The curve is a very characteristic one, the maximum of 50 cases occurring in the last week of September. The average notifications for the past seven years are shown in green. There were 36 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 3.5 per cent. This is very slightly higher than in the previous year when it was 3 per cent. The disease, as in the previous year, was of a very mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 8.0 against 7.6 in 1906. In 131 cases the source of infection was attributed as follows: — Previous cases in house or family 80 Previous cases in neighbouring houses 33 Cases contracted in hospital where they were sent for other reasons 1 School infection 5 "Return cases" 12 In the twelve cases classified as "return cases" the source of infection was some other SCARLET FEVER. Average 7 Years, 1901—1907, marked Green. Notifications, 1907, marked Red. member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attack of scarlet fever within a fortnight previous to the second case occurring. In this case the source of infection in the second case is presumed to be the child recently returned from hospital. A good deal of attention has been given to these so-called "return cases" on the part of the laity, and also by medical authorities, the former being generally inclined to attribute it to premature discharge from the infectious disease hospital. As stated, however, in previous reports, facts do not support this view, because in the first place the cases are very few compared with the number discharged, and in the second case it is sometimes those children who are detained months over the usual time and that cannot be considered to have been prematurely discharged who produce the disease. The micro-organism which produces scarlet fever has yet to be discovered, and the probability is that when this is made it will be found it behaves in a somewhat similar manner to diphtheria and will be found to exist in the nose and throat of the patient who either have not got the disease at all or who have recovered from an attack some considerable time previously. Those patients who have suffered from complications leading to pathological discharges from nose, throat and ears are more liable to spread the disease than simple uncomplicated cases. Measles. The number of deaths for 1907 was 51, against 94 in 1906 and 59 in 1905.

It is a disease which is liable to return in epidemics every two or three years. I lie explanation of this is that an epidemic comes and uses up all the susceptible material m the district, i.e., the young children, and when it has exhausted this it leaves the district for a year or two until fresh births supply more susceptible material for another outbreak. It is unfortunately one of those infectious diseases which is little amenable to those ordinary measures which are commonly adopted for the prevention of infectious diseases, viz., isolation and disinfection. Isolation 'has proved useless because the disease is infectious before the characteristic symptoms appear, and disinfection was tried in this Borough for some years apparently without effect. Last year no attempt was made to disinfect except after a death, and the mortality was the lowest there has been for some years. I did not find it necessary to close any schools or classes on account of this disease during the year, the only precautions adopted being those detailed in the regulations of the London County Council, the main principle underlying which is the exclusion of susceptible "contacts." One of the methods of lowering the mortality of measles consists not so much m preventing children getting it as in suitable nursing and treatment when they have got it.

The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 41. There was a very slight increase in the number of eases but they may all be classified as sporadic, i.e. isolated cases, so that there was nothing at all in the nature of an outbreak. Puerperal fever. 5 cases of puerperal fever were notified. There were two deaths. Membranous Croup. 3 patients were notified as suffering from membranous croun. These have been included with the notifications of diphtheria. Phthisis. 112 cases of phthisis were voluntarily notified during 1907. These were notifications of fresh cases, the corresponding number for 1906 being 114 (exclusive of 56 cases notified from the Union Infirmary). 102 premises were disinfected, of which number 44 were in connection with notified patients. Patients were supplied with disinfectant on application at the Town Hall. The voluntary notification of phthisis in Bermondsey cannot be considered an unqualified success since we only have a small percentage of the actual cases. The main advantage at present of having compulsory notification of this disease would be that we would get to know all the cases and would have power to get more disinfection done than at present. Many of the advantages, however, would be discounted unless provision was made for isolation and treatment of suitable cases. No doubt the present fall in the disease is largely due to the increased knowledge of the mode of its spread among the medical profession and the laity, but a great deal remains to be done yet.

Owing to the particular part of the body which it attacks the symptoms are essentially " nervous" in character, the first stage being characterised by irritation by the inflammation, and the latter stages of coma are due to the pressure of the fluid on the nerve centres with the consequent driving away of blood and suspension of their activities. The cause of the disease is the micro-organism known as the Diplococcus Intracellularis Meningitidis. It is believed to be infectious under certain conditions, but the mode of spread is as yet a mystery. It is probable that it occurs in the secretions of the nose and throat and is from thence transmitted from person to person in a somewhat similar manner to diphtheria; but this point is not yet settled. It occurs in two forms—the sporadic and the epidemic, and in this respect it resembles many other infectious diseases. In the sporadic form (if posterior basic meningitis be included) it is always more or less with us, the victims being in the majority of cases young children. It will attack a member of the family, but shows very little inclination to spread, and, for this reason, has not been classed among the infectious diseases. The epidemic form, however, seems to be distinctly infectious and may spread rapidly over the community. Considerable outbreaks have recently occurred in Glasgow and Belfast, and there was a fear at one time that the disease would extend beyond these limits and possibly reach London. The County Council decided therefore, in March, 1907, to extend the provisions of sec. 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to cerebro-spinal meningitis, making it notifiable for a period of six months. This was renewed in September for a further period of eighteen months. In the second order the Council considered that posterior basic meningitis, which is caused by the same micro-organism as the epidemic form and has been known for a long time in London, should be included in the term "cerebrospinal fever," but that cases of meningitis due to other causes, such as that due to tuberculosis, syphilis, middle-ear disease, or injury, should not be included in this term. The London County Council followed the same custom as they have done on previous occasions in smallpox by issuing inquiry forms to each of the sanitary authorities, having these sent to the Central Health Office, there to be duplicated and sent out to all the authorities. In this way every medical officer in the metropolis was kept informed of the progress of the disease in the various boroughs. There were 132 cases and 25 deaths in London during the year under report. In Bermondsey 7 cases were notified by medical practitioners. During the last three quarters of the year, i.e., after the notification of the disease came into force, inquiries were made into all cases of meningitis in which tubercle or some other special cause was not stated on the death certificate. In this way twelve were inquired into and in one of these the disease was found to be tubercular in character. One death not included in the above was certified by the Coroner to be due to cerebro-spinal meningitis, but this on subsequent examination of the fluid was found to be tubercular. This leaves eleven cases which died of meningitis, the nature of which still remains uncertain. They all presented some symptoms of cerebro-spinal fever, but as there was no post-mortem or bacteriological examination in any of them it is impossible to say how many of them may or may not have been tubercular. The difficulty of diagnosing the two forms is very great since each may present symptoms of the other, and all that could be said about these cases, after consultation with the medical attendant, was that they were probably meningitis but did not belong to the epidemic form. The following are the particulars of the notified cases: — (1) E.E.M.D., 8 years, female, of New Church Street, notified 23rd April. The child attended the infants' department of East Lane School. Her father was a casual labourer. This patient was, to outward appearance, in perfect health up to Tuesday night, 16th April, and attended school on that date. On Wednesday forenoon she complained of headache, and had several attacks of vomiting, so that she was unable to go to school. The mother thought it was simply a bilious attack, and, thinking she would be able to attend school in the afternoon, had her dressed with the view of sending her there. She remained quite sensible up to 2 o'clock in the afternoon, but gradually got worse, and had what was thought to be a fit about 2.30. She rapidly became insensible alter this, and the coma gradually increased until she died at 3.30. There was no eruption Two doctors were sent for, but they happened to be out, so that no doctor saw the patient before death. The rapidity and severity of the symptoms at once aroused the suspicions of the medical practitioner called in, and he immediately communicated with the Coroner. He ordered a post-mortem examination to be made and this revealed the fact that the child died of cerebro-spinal meningitis. This was confirmed by bacteriological examination. On reporting the matter to the Committee I stated: —There is no doubt that this child died of acute cerebro-spinal meningitis, but whether it should be considered the epidemic form of the disease it is difficult to say. There was no apparent source of infection. There had been no previous cases of illness of any kind in the house : there was no history of consumption suggesting that the disease might be tubercular, and the whole circumstances were extremely obscure. (2) C.L., 4 years, female, of The Grange, notified 28th April. The father was a carman. The patient did not attend school. The illness began suddenly on 10th April with feverishness and dyspnoea. On the morning of the 11th she had twitching of hands and face, refused food, and was sick. Later on the same day she seemed drowsy with slight bulging of the anterior fontanelle. On the 12th, slight retraction and rigidity of the lower limbs. On the 26th she developed slight squint with greater rigidity of arms and legs. On the 29th the squint became more marked and converged towards the right side, and on the 30th she became comatose; no Kernig's sign or tache cerebrale. There was no eruption of any kind. The diagnosis was confirmed by bacteriological examination. This patient recovered. (3) E.P., 2 years, female, Tranton Road, notified on 17th May. The father was a casual labourer. The illness began suddenly on 13th May with convulsions and delirium which developed into coma towards the end. Tache cerebrale was marked, and muscular rigidity marked on the right side, with paralysis of the left leg and external rectus of the left eye. Pietraction of the head and Kernig's sign were both present. There was a slight eruption in the shape of two haemorrhages, one over buttock and one higher up. This patient died on lfith May, and on bacteriological examination a double infection was found of meningococcus and pneumococcus. (4) L.A.G., 1 year 8 months, female, of Guinness Buildings, Pages Walk, notified on 6th July. The father was a porter. The patient was ill first on Sunday morning, 30th June, with drowsiness and vomiting. Convulsions came on at 5 p.m. on Ist July followed by coma and death at 7.30 p.m. The child was dead when the doctor was called in. There was no definite information as to the presence of other symptoms. There was no eruption. The post-mortem examination showed death to be due to cerebro-spinal meningitis. The bacteriological examination was unsatisfactory as there were no microorganisms of any description present. (5) D.L., 55 years, male, of Collett Road, notified on 31st July. The patient was a casual labourer but had not been at work since Christmas. He was taken ill suddenly on 30th July with giddiness and unconsciousness. His head was retracted and drawn to the left side. Tache cerebrale and muscular rigidity were marked; exaggerated knee jerks; vomiting of bloody fluid ; no eruption. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of cerebro-spinal meningitis, but no micro-organisms were found on bacteriological examination of the fluid. (6) G.T., 3½ years, female, of St. James' Road, notified on 8th August. She was taken ill on 2nd August with severe and uncontrollable vomiting. During this time she complained of headache and had marked delirium. On the fourth day she became very drowsy, with widely dilated pupils and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Tache cérèbrale was marked. On the fifth day she became unconscious and remained so until death on 10th August. Kernig's sign was present. There was no eruption. No post-mortem or bacteriological examination was made in this case, but the symptoms were typical enough to warrant the diagnosis of this disease. (7) M.S., 13 years, female, of Perseverance Street, notified on 27th September. The patient attended East Lane School. She was taken ill on the 20th September with headache, pains in the stomach, and on the 25th vomiting came on followed by unconsciousness on the 27th. This patient eventually recovered. There was no eruption. The characteristic point about all these cases is the sudden onset and the severity of the symptoms. In none of them was there any history of illness of any other members of the family or any circumstances which would throw light on the origin of the disease. No second cases occurred in any of the families, so that one is unable to say whether any of them were infectious. Arrangement was made with Dr. Eyre of Guy's Hospital to examine and report on specimens of cerebro-spinal fluid sent up in doubtful cases. At the suggestion of the Local Government Board in their circular letter to sanitary authorities, the precautions usually adopted in cases of infectious disease were taken in this, viz., isolation, disinfection, exclusion of children from school, and keeping " contacts" under observation.

The following report was made to the Public Health Committee:— 25th June, 1907. Scarlet Fever, Neckinger School. I reported at the last meeting of the Committee that between 11th May and 8th June eight cases of scarlet fever had occurred in the infants' department of the Neckinger School, seven of these being in classroom " D," Since that report four additional cases have occurred, two being in classroom " D," making a total of nine in this room. There seems to be no other common source of infection but the classroom these children attend, so I decided to close it for three weeks from Monday 17th June, the necessary order being signed by Aldermen Wilkinson and Storey. Consultations. I was called in by medical practitioners to assist in the diagnosis of doubtful cases of infectious disease in 22 instances. In addition, 15 patients were examined at the request of sanitary inspectors, parents, school teachers, etc. I also examined five applicants for positions as underground convenience attendants, one disinfecting carman and one library porter. III.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. Staff. During the year under report the Borough Council sustained a considerable loss in the staff owing to the resignation of the chief sanitary inspector, Mr. Thomas. He had been in ill health during the latter part of 1906 and the early part of 1907 and had to take change of air. He found, however, that directly he came back to Bermondsey he relapsed, and, as a consequence of medical reports on his condition, the Council decided to grant him a pension on 16th July for the twenty-four years' service up to the amalgamation of the vestries of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe and the Board of Works for the St. Olave's District. Partly owing to recommendations in my previous annual reports as to the advisability of having a female sanitary inspector, the London County Council in 1906 addressed a letter to this Council with reference to the staff of inspectors, and in December of that year wrote to know if any steps had been taken to increase that staff. This led up to a special report by myself and the chief inspector, and, when the question of the latter's resignation came up, to a further report by the chairman of the Public Health Committee making various suggestions as to the reorganisation of the outside staff. This was followed by another report by myself suggesting various alterations, the gist of which was that there should be seven district inspectors, and one inspector for looking after food and drugs, one for examining food, and one female inspector for looking after factories and workshops where females are employed, making a total outside staff of ten. This was considered many times by the Committee without coming to any decision, and finally, as there were only eight inspectors and the Council had failed to fill up the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Thomas, the London County Council reported us to the Local Government Board as defaulters. As nothing has been settled at the time of writing I purpose deferring this subject until the next annual report. Housing of the Working Classes Acts. There was no action taken under the above Acts during the year under report. Food and Drugs. In Tables XIII. and XIV. of Appendix will be found a list of the samples taken in 1907 and the action taken. 1342 samples were taken, compared with 1163 in 1906 and 990 in 1905. Of these 11.5 per cent, were found adulterated, compared with 10.4 per cent, in the previous year, and 8.7 per cent. in 1905. There has been no alteration in the method of administering the Food and Drugs Acts but the Committee have at present under consideration the question of the appointment of a special inspector for this purpose. In the accompanying table will be seen the percentages of milk fat in the various samples of genuine milk. They have been put in tabular form this year for convenience. From this it will be seen that there were a greater number of very poor samples in the year under report than in 1906. Total Genuine Samples. Milk Fat.

The baths erected for the purpose of administering the above Act were put into working order in January of the year under report. The Committee made arrangements that the bath for males should be superintended by the Disinfector in Charge and that the bath for females should be under the care of Mrs. Delacour, the caretaker of the Council's shelter. It was decided her remuneration was to be at the rate of 6d. per head with a maximum of 10s. per head. The number of adult males who were cleansed and had their clothing disinfected under the Act was 45, and the number of females 1; two other adult females, who came up in charge of children, received baths, making a total of 3. It soon became apparent that, while they were used regularly by a certain number of males, the applications from adult females were likely to be very small. Bills setting forth the advantages of the baths, and cards for giving particulars of the applicant were printed and sent to common lodging houses, clergymen, doctors, and the Poor Law Guardians. On 11th October, 1906, the following letter was received from the Medical Officer, Education Department of the London County Council: — A scheme for cleansing the heads of children attending the schools under the supervision of the Council has been in operation for some considerable time. There is now little difficulty in regard to the heads, but we find children attending school with verminous bodies and clothing. The following scheme has been applied in several districts with marked success:— The nurse visits the schools, examines the children and notes the names and addresses of all who are unfit to be in school owing to their verminous condition. In some cases the names and addresses are forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health, whose inspectors call at the homes and leave a copy of card (No. 1). In other cases the Medical Officers of Health furnish me with a supply of cards (No. 2) which the head teachers send to the parents. I shall be glad to know whether you would be willing to co-operate if this scheme were put in force in your district, and if so, what methods you would like to adopt. A reply was sent to the effect that a females' bath had been erected under the Cleansing of Persons Act, and doubtless the Council would make some arrangements whereby children could be cleansed in that bath. It was decided a temporary trial should be made. Under this scheme 331 children were cleansed, 123 of which were males and 208 females. A good warm bath was given in each case, and in the case of vermin in the head a 2 per cent, solution of lysol very soon got rid of them. Their wearing apparel was put through the disinfector. In connection with these baths 2,249 articles of apparel were disinfected during the year under report. No doubt a great deal of good was done, but for a systematic cleansing of school children the accommodation is insufficient. There would require for instance to be a proper waiting room, and an attendant or two if the children were to be sent in in any large number. We are at present going on with this work, but I understand the London County Council is considering some large scheme for carrying this out. Inspections. In Table XII. of Appendix will be found particulars of the general sanitary work by the District Inspectors during 1907, and in Table IX. the number of premises on the Registers to which special attention has been paid. The house-to-house inspections number 6600. This is 1580 above the total for the previous year, and is an average of 802 per Inspector (exclusive of Mr. Thomas' inspections), against 558 in 1906. The number of reinspections was 28874, against 27229 in 1906. 4098 intimation notices were served, compared with 3547, and 1147 statutories, against 1089 in the previous year. Offensive Matter. Two summonses were taken out under the London County Council's bye-laws for carriage of offensive matter through streets in unsuitable receptacles and during prohibited hours, particulars of which are given in appended table :— Date of offence. Offence. Result of prosecution. Name and address. 1907. 10th September Carriage of offensive matter during prohibited hours. Fine 5s.; costs 2s. Ambrose Wilson, 49, Glaucus Street, Devons Road, Bromley. Fine 5s.; costs 2s. In unsuitable receptacle. Do. Offensive Trades. The offensive trades on the Register are as follow:— Tripe boiler 1 Glue and size makers 4 Fellmongers 3 Fat melters 4 Manure manufacturer 1 135 inspections were made, against 336 in 1906, and 6 notices served. Mr. Ball, on behalf of Messrs. B. Young & Co., made an application to the London County Council in the early half of 1907 to allow their premises in Dunlop Place to be enlarged. In making this application he pointed out that as a matter of fact they had abandoned a considerable piece of ground which was included in the plan of the premises originally licensed, and that the piece of ground they proposed to take in was much smaller than this but in a more convenient place for erecting a shed in which it was intended to store only finished products. The matter was referred to the Public Health Committee and we reported that as a matter of fact the alteration would be an improvement. It was thought that the best way would be for Mr. Ball to apply for a fresh licence for the whole business, submitting plans and particulars. Under the circumstances this Council decided not to oppose the licence, which was accordingly granted on 10th July. Milk Premises. There were 255 milk premises on the Register at the end of 1900. 18 were added and 4 removed during 1907, making a total of 269 on the Register at the end of the year under report. 739 inspections were made and and 52 notices served. One summons was taken out under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 1885 and 1886, for non-registration, and a fine of 40s. and 21s. costs inflicted. Cowsheds. There are 7 cowsheds in the Borough. These received regular visits, the total number of inspections for 1907 being 64. Two notices were served. Slaughterhouses. There are 2 slaughterhouses in the Borough. 48 inspections were made. No notices were served. Ice Cream Premises. There were 70 premises where ice cream is manufactured on the Register at the end of 1906, and none added or removed during the year under report. 291 inspections were made and 54 notices served. Houses Let in Lodgings. In 1906 there were 224 "houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family "on the Register, and during 1907 one was removed, making the total 223. These were visited quarterly, in accordance with the instructions of the Public Health Committee, the total number of inspections being 426. 83 notices were served, 4 of these being for overcrowding.

The inspections refer to the number of separate lots, and the weights are only approximate. The total number of inspections of wharves, factories and shops where food stuffs are stored or made was 2780. The following reports were submitted to the Public Health Committee with reference to food:- Damaged Rice. 9th April. On 23rd February notice was received from the Port Sanitary Authority that they had given permission to the owners of Fisher's and Upper Globe Wharves to land at these places some 90 tons of damaged rice, viz., 38 tons at the former, and 52 at the latter. The rice came from five barges, which were accidently run down off Blackwall Point, and had been soaKed for two tides in Thames water at this place. After the rice had been dried application was made by the owner to me to know if I had any objection to its being used for human food. Samples of the rice before and after drying were submitted. In the former it appeared yellow from the soaking in water. After drying it was white, but broken and powdered a good deal, so that it could not be taken for anything but a damaged article. Bacteriological examination both before and after drying showed the presence of bacillus coli communis, due to the sewage in the Thames water at this spot. From these facts I decided that the rice was not fit for human food, and replied to that effect. To allow such an article to be used for human food would, in my opinion, be stultifying all recent legislation, which aims at the protection of food from contamination during every stage of its production. If it is injurious to allow the effluvium of a w.c. or drain to penetrate into a bakehouse or other place where food is prepared, so much the more should it be prevented from soaking into the contents of either of these places, even when diluted with Thames water. This case is similar to that of the coffee berries last year, in which the Magistrate who examined the largest part of the bulk refused to condemn it, since the defendants proved that the berries would be subjected to a very high temperature during roasting, when any deleterious products due to soaking in Thames water might be supposed to be destroyed. There is, however, one important difference, in that rice is frequently eaten in an insufficiently cooked condition. The owners at once fell in with this decision, so that it was not necessary to formally seize it, and they were subsequently able to dispose of it after receiving guarantees, which they forwarded to me, that it should not be used for human food. The names and addresses of the purchasers were supplied, and the Medical Officers of the various districts concerned, and in the case of Belgium, the Government were advised of the decision arrived at, the destination of the consignment, as well as the name of the ship by which it was forwarded. Butter, ex ss. " Suevic." 9th April. On 25th March a message was received from the Port Sanitary Authority that they had given permission for 1,000 cases of butter, salved from the ss. " Suevic," which went aground off Land's End, to proceed to Cotton's Wharf. The worst damaged packages were examined by myself and the District Inspector, but there was no reason for interfering with its sale since the principal damage occurred in the handling of the packages. Some of them had been soaked in sea water, but this would not, in my opinion, render the concents unfit for food, because even if the sea water was not quite pure, which is improbable, it could not penetrate any distance into the bulk. Cartage of Bullocks' Heads. 9th April. Complaints have been received by me relating to the custom of meat contractors of carting away the heads of bullocks which have been slaughtered at the Deptford Cattle Market and other places through the streets in uncovered vans. Not only is the meat liable to contamination by this method of conveyance, but the appearance of these heads, which are generally covered with blood, is very disgusting to many people who frequent the streets. I have often seen the vans not only being driven through the streets but occasion illy standing still while the drivers are refreshing themselves. The London County Council are already very strict about the conveyance of dead horses through the streets, and I think some similar method should be adopted for conveying not only bullocks' heads but dead meat generally in properly covered vans. I recommend that a copy of my report be sent to the London County Council, with the request that they take the natter into their consideration. A letter was sent to the County Council in accordance with this suggestion. Unsound Food. The following articles were brought to the notice of the Department, found to be unfit for human food, and destroyed as trade refuse: — Tons. Cwt. Qrs. Lbs.

Register of Places where Food is Prepared for Sale. The following table gives the number and kind of the various places where food is prepared (exclusive of the warehouses and wharves on the riverside) at present on our register:— Butchers 59 Pork butchers 6 Confectioners (wholesale) 3 Picklers 2 Coffee and eating houses 131 Restaurants 11 Eel pie shops 9 Tinned provision merchants 4 Fried fish shops 33 Tearooms 2 Fish shops 28 Various 7 Fish curers 7 Total 306 Ham and beef shops 2 Oyster rooms 2 Disinfection. The following table shows the number of articles passed through the steam disinfector during the year under report: — Beds 1539 Pillows 2513 Blankets 1667 Quilts 1432 Bolsters 888 Sheets 1706 Carpets 711 Miscellaneous 10,929 Cushions 632 Total 23,871 Mattresses 1296 Palliasses 558 33,357 new tabs were used to replace those taken off mattresses, palliasses, and cushions before disinfection. The following are reports made to the Public Health Committee with reference to the disinfection of Neckinger Schools for vermin. Neckinger Schools. 25th June. As a consequence of complaints of vermin and smells at the above Schools, I instructed the District Inspector, Mr. Jones, to visit and report as to its condition. He was informed by the Head Master and Mistress, as well as by the Caretaker, that vermin are frequently seen both in the classrooms and corridors, in cupboards and in the scholars' books. Smells were also complained of in some of the classrooms, and on examining the ventilation" pipe which runs through the Caretaker's w.c. up towards the roof with the smoke test, he found all the joints defective, permitting smoke to escape. This probably accounts for the smells in those rooms, the windows of which are in close proximity to this ventilation pipe. The boys' urinal in the playground was also in a foul condition and smelled offensive, and in the infants' urinal parts of the unrendered walls are used by the children, and were offensive, being neither impervious nor flushed. The fifth w.c. pan from the entrance in the boys' lavatory was broken, and the inspection chamber cover in the yard of the Caretaker's house was broken. I visited the School on the 20th June, in company with the Inspector, and can confirm all these conditions. The furniture and cupboards in this school are very old, and I found there were any amount of crevices for harbouring vermin. For instance, the space between the door frame and walls in the classroom I examined (B, Girls' Department) was filled up with paper and covered over with plaster. There was also a number of apparently useless canvas curtains, and on one of these I found vermin, as also did the Inspector on another one in the same room on a previous occasion. It seems that last summer, during the hot weather, the conditions were very bad, and I can quite believe, if we have similar hot weather this year, they will become very much worse than they are at present. We have power to deal with verminous houses and articles under Part IV. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, but I think it would be preferable in this case to draw the attention of the County Council to the condition of this school, when I have no doubt they will take means to abate the nuisance. 29th October. On the 25th June last I reported with reference to certain complaints made as to the above, one of which referred to the verminous condition of some of the departments. As a result of this, Class Rooms A, B, C, D and E of the Girls' Department were disinfected with sulphur at the end of June. At that time I reported that the furniture and cupboards were very old and contained any number of crevices for harbouring vermin, and that the space between the door frame and the walls in Class Room B was filled up with paper and plastered over. Little or nothing was done to remedy these conditions, with the exception of refilling this space. On the 17th inst. I received two further complaints, one being from a Manager of the School, that the carpenter had occasion to do some work which necessitated taking the tops off some of the desks, when he found a lot of vermin on the under parts. As a consequence of this I visited the school the same afternoon, together with the District Inspector, and had the tops taken off a few of the desks in each of the departments, and found evidence of vermin both alive and dead between the iron stand and the desk top. The larger specimens were obviously ordinary bed bugs, but the smaller ones had more the appearance of lice and nits, so I had them examined by Dr. Eyre, of Guy's Hospital, who is a Parasitologist, and he reported they were the eggs and young of the ordinary bed bug. In the Girls' and Infants' Departments they were particularly bad, for the specimens I saw could be numbered by thousands, and gave one an idea of the verminous condition in which the whole school must be. I have rarely seen a much worse condition in any of the poorest homes since I have been in Bermondsey, and recommend that a notice be served on the London County Council under Section 20 of their General Powers Act of 1904 requiring them to take such steps as may be necessary for the purpose of destroying and removing the vermin. 12th November. As a result of my letter to the London County Council drawing attention to the verminous condition of the above, arrangements were at once made to close the schools from Friday the 25th ult., to the following "Wednesday, and a request was made to this department to disinfect the whole building. The amount of work to be done being very large and the time limited, extra assistance had to be obtained and the men worked from 6 a.m. until late at night. The total number of cubic feet disinfected was 162,840, and the amount of sulphur used was 819½lbs. The total cost including labour, stores, and an establishment charge of 15 per cent, for the use of pails, brushes, disinfecting pans, ladders, etc., amounted to £10 5s. 0½d. The old desks have been replaced by new ones all through the building, except in the babies' room, and after fumigation the walls and woodwork were washed by the County Council with a disinfectant. I drew the attention of the Chief Executive Officer to the filthy state of the under portions of the platforms by means of which the desks are raised above the floor level, to the fact that the old cupboards had been allowed to remain, and also that in the babies' room the old desks were left; but these omissions have not been remedied. I think something should be done, as nooks of this description will only serve as a starting point for a fresh invasion by vermin. I requested the Town Clerk to write to the County Council as to the question of defraying the cost, but no reply has yet been received. The whole disinfection was carried out under the supervision of the District Inspector (Mr. Jones), who was in constant attendance. 14th January, 1908. The above were again disinfected during the Christmas Holidays, the cost for labour, materials and an establishment charge of 15 per cent, being £12 14s. 8d., an account of which has been forwarded to the London County Council. The old desks previously objected to have been removed from the Babies' Room, and the platforms upon which the desks in the other rooms are supported were raised to enable the disinfectant to penetrate underneath them. The old cupboards have also been replaced by new, so that every request made with a view to getting rid of the vermin has been complied with. Bacteriological Laboratory.

The following report was made to the Public Health Committee on 8th October with regard to re-draining the Neckinger Mortuary, and also as to closing this mortuary and centralising the work at the St. Marychurch Street Mortuary, and building a new Coroner's court and offices : — The discovery of the necessity of reconstructing part of the drainage of the Neckinger Mortuary raises the question of the advisability of doing away with this building altogether, and, should the Council decide to do this, as to whether there is sufficient accommodation at the Mortuary in Rotherhithe. As mentioned in a previous report, the Neckinger Mortuary was built in 1891, by Mr. H. Russell, under the superintendence of the late Surveyor, Mr. Elkington, at a cost of £438, at which time Dr. Dixon was Medical Officer of Health, and Mr. Thomas Chief Inspector. It is a small mortuary situated in an unsuitable position and has very bad approaches. I am informed that the undertakers have to drive through the depot to get to it and have great difficulty in turning since the small space in front, which might be available for this purpose, is largely occupied for the storage of material, carts, etc., for want of room elsewhere. The total number of bodies received into this mortuary in 1906 was 156, which may be considered an average number, and the number of post-mortem examinations 71. There is not sufficient work here to occupy the whole time of the keeper, who fills in his time attending to the disinfecting apparatus. The Rotherhithe Mortuary, which is situated in St. Mary's Churchyard, was built in November, 1895, at a cost of £1,000. It is much larger, and can give accommodation for a great many more bodies than it is now used for. 1 here are rarely more than four or five bodies in it at a time and the noninfectious room is capable of comfortably accommodating 25 and 30 bodies at one time and in case of emergency many more, against 12 and 15 in the corresponding room of the Neckinger Mortuary. It is up to date, the situation, light and ventilation being excellent, and the drainage quite modern and in good condition. The number of bodies received into this mortuary last year was 97. Inquiries have been made from Southwark as to the number of bodies belonging to Bermondsey which were deposited in the Mortuary at Collier's Rents during 1906, and I find this was 55, on which 27 post-mortem examinations were made. They mostly came from either Parish Street Workhouse or the river. I understand there is a possibility of the district of St. Olave, which is at present under the jurisdiction of the City of London and Southwark Coroner, Dr. Waldo, being incorporated in the Bermondsey District under Dr. Oswald. If such should take place, in addition to the 253 bodies received in the two mortuaries, accommodation might have to be made for 55. The maximum accommodation would thus have to be for about 320. This number is not likely to materially increase since the population of the Borough is not increasing. In my opinion the Rotherhithe Mortuary is large enough to accommodate all these bodies with ease, and this would give sufficient occupation for nearly the whole time of one Mortuary Keeper. There would thus be no necessity for having a mortuary at the Neckinger Depot, the space for which could be otherwise utilised. Should the Committee think of adopting this suggestion of only having one mortuary the proper course would be to consider the advisability of building a suitable Coroner's Court attached to the Mortuary at Rotherhithe, the present Court in Bermondsey being only a makeshift, about which I am constantly hearing complaints of want of accommodation and bad ventilation. The Rotherhithe Court is a considerable distance from the Mortuary and necessitates much waste of time on the part of the jury going to view the bodies. There is plenty of room in the neighbourhood of the Rotherhithe Mortuary for the erection of a suitable court and waiting room. I have 110 doubt that the General Purposes Committee would be willing to make some allowance for the site of the Mortuary, Neckinger, and this would go towards the expenses of the Coroner's Court. The concentration here suggested would lead to economy and efficiency in administration. Enclosed with this report is a table giving information regarding the mortuary arrangements in other boroughs. From this it will be seen that nineteen boroughs have only one mortuary and five have two. In most of the cases in which the boroughs have more than one mortuary it is due to the amalgamation of smaller districts. The Borough Surveyor reported as follows:— I report that from an examination the chief defects apparent in the drainage of the Bermondsey Mortuary are the dipstone trap chamber in the back yard, non-trapping of the sink and lavatory waste and a bad pattern gully under waste from Post-mortem Room sink. I am of opinion that a new system throughout should be laid and a manhole built in front of the Post-mortem Room, and a 6in. main drain taken to a new manhole in the rear to which new branches should be taken from w.c., lavatory gully, infectious mortuary, rain-water pipe. The gullies in the post-mortem room and general mortuary being taken by separate drains to a manhole in the front, a new gully being placed immediately outside post-mortem room to take sink waste, traps will be required under sink and lavatory as before mentioned, and a fresh-air inlet must be provided in front with a vent at back. I estimate the cost of the above works at £30. On the matter coming before the Council at their meeting on 15th October it was decided to discontinue the use of Neckinger Mortuary. IV.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS.
