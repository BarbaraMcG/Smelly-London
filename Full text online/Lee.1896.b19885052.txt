THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LEE DISTRICT. REPORT, 1896 = 7. i. Pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the following is the Report of the proceedings of the Board in the execution of that Act and the statutes amending the same, and of the works commenced and completed respectively in the year ended 25th March, 1897, and the works remaining in progress at the termination of such year, and also of any proceedings taken by the Board in such year for the removal of nuisances or the improvement of the Sanitary condition of the District. Some of such works and proceedings are shown in detail in 12 the reports of the Surveyors and Sanitary Inspectors and other Officers following. There are also annexed hereto copies of the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, and other tabular statements, including a Report (Table A, page 21), showing Population, Number of Houses and Rateable Value in respect of each Parish in the District as compared with last year and with the whole Metropolis. The result of the election of the last County Council is also shown (page 20). 2- The annual report of the Public Analyst for this District is also published herewith. 3. Particulars of prosecutions by the Board for offences are also given in a separate report. 4. The Acts of Parliament under which this Board exercises its various powers in this District of the Metropolis, are chiefly as follows : — The Metropolis Management Acts. 5. The Metropolis Management Act, 1855, 18 and 19 Vict., Cap. 120, is the Act under which the Board was originally constituted and the District defined. The District, then called Plumstead District, included the following Parishes, viz.:—Charlton, Eltham, Kidbrook, Lee and Plumstead. The Metropolis Management (Plumstead and Hackney) Act, 1893, separated Plumstead from the 13 District. It is now the "Lee District," and includes Charlton, Eltham, Lee, and Kidbrook Parishes. The Vestries of these Parishes elect members to the Board, the Vestries being themselves elected by the ratepayers by ballot under the Local Government Act, 1894. The annual election of members to the Board by the Vestries takes place in each Parish on the first Wednesday in the month of June. One third of the members go out of office annually, all members retiring on the first Wednesday in June in the third year from their election. The number of members for each Parish is set out in the tabular form at the foot of this report. The members of the Board were formerly persons rated or assessed at a certain amount. The Local Government Act, 1894, now regulates the qualification of members. 6. The principal duties of this District Board under the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855-90, and the London Building Act, 1894, consists of the construction, repair, and cleansing of sewers (except main sewers, which are now vested in the London County Council), the supervision of house drainage, and the execution of the office of "Surveyor of Highways." The Board can repair, pave, light, improve, water, and maintain public ways, and prevent obstructions there. In new streets, paving works can be executed and sewers can be constructed by the Board at the cost of the owners and occupiers. The growth of the District involves the frequent formation of new streets, and consequently much work has to be done by the Board in paving and sewerage. Under these Acts 14 also, temporary repairs can now be executed by the Board in new streets, and this also has been done in several cases. 7. The expenditure of the Board, under these and other Acts hereinafter mentioned, and the contributions of the District to the expenditure of the London School Board, are met by precepts issued by the Board to the Overseers of the various Parishes in the District in proportion to the rateable value of property in such Parishes. The rateable value appears in the table set out at the end of this report. The accounts of the Board have to be audited annually by three unpaid auditors chosen by the Board in April from amongst the Vestry Auditors of the District. The London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, has afforded some slight relief to this District. (See Accounts). Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 8. This Act came into operation on the 1st of January, 1892. It has been slightly extended by the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Amendment Act, 1893." This Act of 1891 is a most important Act, and repeals many of the provisions of the Metropolis Management and other Acts. It also repeals the Nuisance Removal Act, 1855, and some sections of later Sanitary Acts and makes new and in some respects different provisions in substitution of the Acts repealed, and also contains additional provisions with regard to Public Health in the County of London. The 15 Act of 1891 constitutes this Board the " Sanitary Authority" for the District. New provisions are introduced as to the appointment or re-appointment of Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors, and as to Polluted Wells, Cesspools, Mortuaries, and other matters. Duties are imposed upon the Board as a Sanitary Authority to properly cleanse and sweep Streets, including the footways, and to collect street refuse. All Owners and Occupiers are now exempt from obligation to sweep and cleanse footways. Prosecutions under this Act have been numerous. This Board passed and the Local Government Boad approved some necessary bye-laws under this Act in 1893, and others in 1895. Food and Drugs Acts. 9. Under the Sale of Food & Drugs Acts, 1875-9, (38 and 39 Vict., c. 63, and 42 and 43 Vict., c. 30), the Board appoints Inspectors, who obtain samples of food and drugs, which are analysed by the Public Analyst appointed by the Board. The vendors of adulterated articles are prosecuted. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. 10. The Housing of the Working Class Act, 1890, has been very much used in other and more crowded districts, but the houses here are comparatively new, and are not so closely built. The health of the district stands high, and the Board after enquiry has not found it necessary to take any proceedings under this Act. 16 Local Government Act, 1894. 11. A special report by myself upon the effect of the Local Government Act, 1894, on the constitution and powers of this Board has been published. It is only necessary therefore to add that by an Order of the 23rd March, 1895, (amended by an Order of 4th April, 1895), the Local Government Board, with the concurrence of this Board, amongst other things, transferred from the Justices to the Vestries of the Parishes of Charlton and Kidbrook, within this district, the duty of appointing Overseers for such Parishes respectively. Increase of Number of Members. 12. Consequent on an application made by the Vestry of Charlton on the 12th July, 1895, to the London County Council, to re-apportion the number of members of this Board, the Council decided to grant the request. It appears that, from the account of the population in 1891, the relative number of inhabited houses in the parishes forming the district was found to have varied from that shown by the last previous census. The Council, by order dated 12th November, 1895, and by virtue of the powers contained in section 33 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Local Government Act of 1888, ordered that the number of members of this Board should be altered from 33 to 39, and be elected for the parishes in the numbers following, i.e. :— 17 Parishes. Number of Members Elected Now. Number of Members formerly Elected. Charlton 12 9 Eltham 6 6 Kidbrook 3 3 Lee 18 15 39 33 Brook Hospital, Shooters' Hill Road. 13. The construction of this large block of buildings and the consequent arrangements to be made for the drainage thereof have occupied much time, both of the Committees of the Board and its Officers. The Hospital is situate in the parish of Kidbrook, and occupies with enclosures 32 acres of land, of which, buildings occupy 22 acres, and are intended for 800 people. The drainage scheme mentioned in this Board's last annual report has now been carried out and compensation claims adjusted. It only remains to settle accounts with the Asylums Board. 14. During the past year the Board received notice of an application by the Blackheath and Greenwich District Electric Light Company, Limited, to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 & 1888, for the lighting of streets and places near Blackheath. The area includes part of all the Blackheath Electric Lighting. 18 parishes within this District, as well as Greenwich parish and part of Lewisham. This Board required certain amendments in the draft Order, and agreements by the Company, to apply on certain conditions, if required by this Board, for a further Provision'Order for the remainder of this Board's District, and as to the rate of charges for public lighting. These terms having been conceded, this Board consented to the Order, and it has now been granted by the Board of Trade, and awaits Parliamentary sanction. London Local Goverment. 15. On the recommendation, in its report of 1894, by Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London, that no duties should be thrown upon the Central Authority which could be equally well performed by the Local Authorities, the London County Council convened a conference of the Local Authorities of the Metropolis and a Committee of the Council. The chairman of the Board (Mr. Gates, J.P.), and Mr. White, and the Clerk of this Board represented this Board. I reported on the 22nd January, 1896, in much detail on the subject, and attached to such Report a Schedule containing powers which it was suggested should be transferred from the London County Council to Local Authorities. The Board approved of such Report, ordered copies to be sent to the London County Council, the City Corporation, and the Vestries and District Boards, with a request to support the Board's views. 19 The Conference met several times, and was of opinion that many powers now exercised by the Council should be transferred to the Local Authorities. The resolutions of the Conference were printed by the Council. I gave notice of motion that the final decisions of the Conference should be communicated to the Local Government Board, and such Board should be requested to take steps to give legislative effect thereto, yet such motion was held not to be in order. No further steps appear to have yet been taken to comply with the- recommendations of the Royal Commission or Conference. Generally. 16. There is still a continuing increase in population, houses and streets, and consequently in the work and duties of the Board's officers. The report of Police Court proceedings annexed gives particulars of summonses issued. The rateable value of the District according to the Valuation List, which will come into force on the 6th April next, is £286,094. The annexed Table "A" gives some other figures showing the growth of the District. The present movements as to rating Government property and municipalities for London District may hereafter relieve the ratepayers of some parishes in this District or affect Local Government generally.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to report to you upon tlie work done by me, as Public Analyst to your Board, during the year ending March 31st, 1897. The number of samples analysed was 100, and of these 5 were adulterated. All the samples were purchased and submitted for analysis by the Inspectors of the Board. The subjoined tables give the various articles which have been examined, their number and description, as well as the general analytical results. Where the article was found to be adulterated, the nature and extent of the adulteration are shown. 26 Of the samples of groceries, the three coffee extracts examined all contained less caffeine than they should have done if they had been properly prepared from coffee. Of the four samples of peas, I reported three as adulterated, as they contained copper equal to 1 grain of metal per pound or upwards, while the other sample also contained some copper, but not sufficient in my opinion to justify action. In addition to the two milks reported as adulterated, I reported two others as "suspicious," and two more as "poor in fat." I am, Yours faithfully, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D. Public Analyst. 27 TABLE I.

CHARLTON. REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1890. To the Board of Works for the Lee District. Gentlemen, 1. I beg to present my Annual Report (16th) on the sanitary condition of the Parish of Charlton, for the year ending December 31st, 1896. 2. The Census taken in 1891 gave the number of inhabitants as 12,122. The figures on which this report is founded are 13,753, so that the increase may be taken as 1,631 (and probably this is under estimated), and the number of houses built and inhabited has been very great as will be shown later. 30 3. The Births have numbered 384 Males Females 185 199 384 giving a ratio of 27.4 per thousand of the population. In 1895 the Births were 371. 4. The Deaths that actually occurred in the Parish were 165, or twenty less than in 1895; but 35 took place in outlying Institutions. The actual figures and places are as follows:— Males Females 87 78—165 Outlying Institutions:— Males Females 17 18— 35 200 giving a ratio of 145 per thousand of the population. This is probably the lowest death rate that has occurred in this parish for many years. 5. There were 3 deaths from "Extra Parochials" one suicide on the railway, one drowning in the river, and one case of heart disease in the public streets. The Totals for 1895 were 211. 6. It is interesting to note that although there are fewer deaths by 11 compared with the previous year, there have been. 31 112 new houses built, inhabited and certified as having an efficient water supply during 1896. On this subject, the following figures show the steady growth of the parish:— 1893 93 1894 49 1895 75 1896 112 so that the parish may be considered as a very healthy one, with so large an increase and so small a death rate. 7. As usual, the Infant Death Rate is high, as in all parishes, and this year numbers 55 under one year, giving a ratio of 14.3 per thousand of births registered. Many of these are in very young infants—many prematurely born, or only having lived a few hours or days, and dying from no particular disease; and 36 are in people over 65 years of age—many of these at a great age> one in particular as old as 99. Eliminate these, and there are only 109, which is a very good record. 8. The Outlying Institutions concerned with the numbers are as follows :— M.A.B. Fever Hospital 5 Woolwich Union 15 Seamen's Hospital 3 St. Thomas Hospital 2 Guy's Hospital 3 King's Hospital 1 Royal Free Hospital 1 Miller Hospital 1 Cane Hill Asylum I Salvation Army Rescue Home 1 River Thames 1 South Eastern Railway 1 35 32 9. I find it again necessary to mention the number of deaths from "Phthisis," Viz: 30. It is true that there are two less than last year, but it is the old story that the removal of dampness might improve this condition, and the low lying part of the parish no doubt requires more efficient drainage, particularly in wet weather, as the houses become flooded at the time and con. sequently damp for a long time — hence a great deal of the Lung disease. During the year I have had a good deal of conversation with the Surveyor as to whether something could not be done in some of the worst cases, that is where several inches of water remained under the floors, and he suggested a plan which we have carried out in four places, of draining by pipes, the basements of the houses into the drain (properly trapped,) and this has succeeded in keeping some of the bouses dry, and some of brickwork in adjoining houses has been removed so that the water falls to the lowest part, and a great improvement has been effected. But this is not enough. It is merely dealing with isolated cases and not with the whole area. I hope still to see a proper "Relief Sewer" for the Marsh District. 10. Heart Disease is responsible for 21 deaths—that is seven more than last year, but many of these are in old people, accompanied by Chronic Bronchitis, &c. Infectious Disease. 11. The total number of cases of this class "Notified" was 104, and those removed 43. These may be classified as follows:— 33  Notified Removed Small Pox 1 Scarlatina 40 19 Diphtheria 42 23 Typhoid 4 1 Puerperal 3 Erysipelas 14 104 43 There was sometimes a difficulty in getting the cases removed, but I believe the Asylum Board does its best in this matter. The majority of the cases in this parish are now taken to the "Brook Hospital" on the Shooters Hill Road, but some go to the Hospital at New Cross. This depends upon the beds at the disposal of the Metropolitan Asylum Board. Small, Pox. 12. The one case of this disease was easily accounted for. A young gentleman living in Church Lane went on a visit to some relatives who were living in lodgings at Sheerness. He very shortly became poorly, and was sent home to Charlton. It then appeared that the Landlady of the lodging at Sheerness had quite recently come from Gloucester (at the time the disease was prevalent there), where she had been more or less in contact with some of the afflicted people. Very prompt, measures were taken here with regard to isolation, vaccination and disinfection, and there was no further spread of the mischief. 34 Scarlatina. 13. There were 40 cases during the year, exactly the same number during 1895, and 39 during 1894. Considering the number of schools in the immediate neighbourhood, this is not a bad record. Diphtheria. 14. As in other parts of the Metropolis this parish suffered more than formerly. There were 42 cases during the year; but in the year 1895 we considered 23 a large number. During that year the cases were mostly associated with the Board School in the Fossdene Road. This year they have been more evenly distributed, and no special school was concerned. There were nine deaths 15. The other principal "Zymotic Diseases" were so few as to call for no special remark. 16. The number of cases of Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea was not great, and the deaths from the former were only eight, and from the latter 13. Measles, although prevalent, only caused eight deaths. General. 17. The Inspector and I keep a close watch upon the parish generally, and continue to experience very little trouble in getting our suggestions or notices carried out. The perishable food supply 35 has given much less trouble than in former years—the purveyors knowing that constant observation is kept. The few real cases of overcrowding Lave been readily dealt with by the Landlords on their attention being drawn to the matter. The "Disinfection'' of the rooms after infectious disease is still carried out with "Chlorine," and with the same satisfactory results. Bake Houses. 18. These have been twice inspected during the year by myself, and at frequent intervals by the Inspector. There has been practically no fault to find with any of them. 19. In conclusion I wish to express my appreciation of the uniform encouragement and support I have received from my Committee, and the kindly assistance from any of the officials with whom I have had to consult. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, HERBERT L. BERNAYS, M.R.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health, for Charlton. January 26th, 1897. K2 3.

CHARLTON. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Lee District. Gentlemen, 1. I herewith submit to you my Annual Report on the several works executed, and the general management of the above Parish, as far as regards my department for the year ended the 25th of March, 1897. 2. During the year notices have been received of intention to build in various parts of the Parish. One hundred and fortynine new dwelling Houses, two stables, one School of Music, one School of Art, one Steam Laundry; also notices for re-drainage of sixteen dwelling houses. One hundred and thirty-one new houses have been finished and occupied during the year. The 38 application and plans for the drainage of the above buildings have been submitted to, and approved by the Board, All the drainage works have been properly laid and connected with the various main sewers in the localities in which the buildings have been erected. The testing of drains by smoke, or water, before they are covered in involves a considerable amount of labour, and absorbs a deal of time, sometimes having to go two or three times to see the drains of a single house, and very often takes half a day before they are found satisfactory. 3. The Road Gullies have been emptied, flashed, and disinfected, and are in good working order. 4. The Marsh Ditches under the control of the Board have been properly cleansed and cleared out; the banks regulated, and the Penstocks have had attention throughout the year. 5. A very few stoppages have occurred in private combined drains; but in some cases it was found necessary to take up and relay the drains, all of which up to the present, have been promptly attended to by the owners, and put in proper order; but I might mention that the question of the Board being responsible (in certain cases) for combined drains is being raised. The Bill prepared and introduced into Parliament under the London County Council unfortunately could not be passed last Session, but in the interest of the ratepayers the question should not cease to be agitated until the law has been altered, as at present it is in an unsatisfactory state. 6. Seventy-four cesspools have been emptied during the year by the Board's workmen. 39 7. Survey, plan, estimate, and schedule of the Owners and Occupiers, with apportionments, having been prepared, submitted to, and approved by the Board for the making up and paving the Calydon Road. 8 The dust collecting works have been carried out during the year by horses, carts, and men employed by the Board by the day, at contract prices, and a few complaints have only been made for non-removal, the expenditure being £879 2s. 0d., but as the number of houses is greatly increasing, and in order to carry out the requirements of the Sanitary Act, it will form a serious item of expense. 9. The watering of the public roads and streets has been carried out during the year for a length of about 11 miles. The water is supplied by the Kent Water Co. at contract prices, viz:—£25 per mile for the season. The cartage has been carried out at contract prices, 6s 8d for horse and man per day, the Board providing two carts and five vans for the purpose. All repairs and painting to the carts and vans have been done by the Board's workmen. The total amount expended on this account being £577 5s. 8d. 10. The tarpaving of the Public footpaths has been repaired (in parts), tarred, and gritted by the Board's workmen. 11. A forty foot new Road, known as Nadine Street, between Church Lane and Elliscombe Road, has been formed and a nine inch pipe sewer laid. The works have been carried out at the expense of the owner Mr. Dickenson Byfield. 40 12. Two forty foot new Roads, known as Rathmore Street and Bettisfield Street, between Victoria Road and Troughton Road, have been formed, and proper pipe sewers laid. These works have been carried out by, and at the expense of the owner, Lady Westbury. 13. Applications have been made to the London County Council during the year for erecting buildings beyond the regular lines of frontage in existing roads, and have had careful attention, and such recommendation, as the circumstances of each case required, has been submitted from time to time to the London County Council. 14. The urinals in the Parish accessible to the Public have been throughout the year kept clean and in proper working; order. 15. The Gas lighting to the Public lamps has been carried out by the South Metropolitan Gas Co. New lamps have been erected during the year, in the following places:— 1 in Cedar Grove. 5 ,, Heathwood Gardens. 1 ,, Blackheath Village. 1 ,, Calydon Road. A few existing lamps removed to better positions. The wholeof the Public lamps, numbering 288, are lighted, cleansed, and maintained by the Company at Contract prices. The amount expended during the year being £935 0s. 7d., including all removals, etc. Six of the lamps at different prominent places have been fitted with Incandescent burners. The extra cost is not at 41 present known, but the improvement of the light seems to be appreciated by the Public generally. 16. The Asphalt paving of the Footpaths has been repaired "where required, at places by the Brunswick Rock Asphalte Company; and the asphalte pavements are now in good order. 17. Six applications have been made for permission to erect hoardings and scaffolding which have received the sanction of the Board, and the License granted in the usual manner. 18. All Main, Brick, and Pipe Sewers, under the control of the Board, have been properly cleansed and flushed out from time to time where required and special attention has been given to the Pipe Sewers in Marsh Area. 19. Nearly three acres of land have been purchased by the Board from the Freeholder, situate on the west side of Anchor and Hope Lane for £1,025; a portion of it has been fenced in with close boarded fence for Store-yard, and another portion let to the Charlton Vestry for allotments, for which the Vestry pays to the Board the sum of £3 per annum. 20. Surveys, plans, sections and estimates have been prepared for the paving of two sections of the Woolwich Road with Guernsey Granite Setts, Kerbing, and Channelling. Copies of the plans and estimates have been forwarded to London County Council, and application made to them for a loan to carry out the work. The present cost of maintenance of the above road is very great, and every year it gets greater, owing to the increase of traffic since the Free Ferry has been opened. 42 21. All the highways, streets, and roads within the Parish, about 12 miles, have been, thoroughly swept and repaired with metalling of suitable kind, according to the respective localities. The margins along the tramways Woolwich Road are repaired with granite, and are very costly to maintain. The following is the quantity of materials put upon the roads during the year:— GRANITE. Woolwich Road 360 yards The Village 46 „ 406 FLINTS.

I have been engaged in writing many special reports during the year, and supplying information and special enquiries from Metropolitan, District, and Provincial Towns, on subjects affecting the management of Municipal matters, also enquiries from the London County Council on sundry matters. 23. In conclusion I havo to report that there are many other works concerning sewers, roads, paving, and various other matters, which have occupied much of my time and attention during the past year, which need not be specially mentioned in this report. The work of this Parish has considerably increased in importance and extent this year. 1 am, Gentlemen, Tour obedient Servant, JOHN" ROWLAND, M.S.A.

Gentlemen, 1. During the past year there were 130 births—67 male and 63 female; giving a birth rate of 21.9 per 1,000—that for the whole of London being 30.2. There were 75 deaths registered as occurring in the district, and 17 in "Outlying" places, of persons belonging to it, making 92 in all. From these five deaths have to be deducted of persons dying in the district not belonging to it; so that the correct number is 87. This gives a death rate of 14.71—that for the whole of London being 18.6. 2. A "Quinquennial" census was taken, of all the London parishes, in 1896, which fixed the population of Eltham at 5911, 52 According to the usual method of calculating the population, on the increase between the last two decennial censuses, it would have been estimated at 6,002—a difference of 91. This makes only a fractional difference in the birth and death rates of .34 in the former, and of .22 in the latter. Of the 17 deaths occurring in "outlying" places, 10 were in the Lewisham Infirmary, and exactly half of these were of persons over 70 years of age. Four were in the South-eastern Fever Hospital, three from Scarlet Fever, and one from Diphtheria. Of the five deaths of persons not belonging to the district, three were from accidents. Zymotic Disease. Deaths 3. There were eight deaths from notifiable Zymotic disease, against seven last year; giving a death rate of 1.35, that for the whole of London being 0.94. There were besides 10 deaths from non-notifiable zymotic disease, giving a death rate from all these put together of 3 04—that for the whole of London being 3.16. Zymotic Cases Notified. 4. 85 cases of this class were notified during the year viz:— Small Pox 0 Scarlet Fever 47 Diphtheria 12 Typhoid Fever 11 Erysipelas 13 Puerperal Fever 2 85 53 Scarlet Fever 5. These cases occurred as follows:— During the 1st Quarter of the year 9 2nd „ „ 26 „ 3rd „ „ 7 „ 4tl „ „ 5 47 Some of those in the 1st quarter were connected with the outbreak at the Pope Street Board School, which was entered into fully in my last year's report. Nearly all those in the 2nd quarter were among children at New Eltham, and the Board School was again the focus of contagion. It was possible however to get them all off to Hospital; so the outbreak, fortunately, did not assume formidable proportions. The other cases were scattered about the parish and could not be traced to any definite source of contagion. Diphtheria. 6. There were 12 cases of this disease, with four deaths. As usual, some cause, sufficient to account for the disease, could be found, in each case, such as contagion or insanitary surroundings of the patient. No. 1. Shooter's Hill—General arrangement of drains very defective. „ 2. High Street—Contracted at Charlton. „ 3. Sun Yard—Holes in pavement, containing dirty stagnant water. 54 No. 4.

Nearly half of them were attributed, by the medical attendants, to eating oysters. No. 1. Victoria Road—No serious defects in drains. Supposed to have contracted the disease at City Offices. „ 2. 14, Pelham Terrace— Probably contracted by unloading some decomposing grains. „ 3 „ 4 15, Pelham Terrace—Probably infected by No. 2, as the patients lived next door. They were man and wife and the disease was doubtless predisposed to by the dirty state of their apartments. „ 5. Pelham Terrace—In the same house as No. 2, and doubtless infected by him. 55 No. 6. The Grange—Attributed to eating oysters a Burham. The drains of the house were found to be very old fashioned and defective and steps are being taken to put them right. „ 7. North Park—Said to be due to eating oysters in the City. No defects in drains. „ 8. Court Yard—Said to be due to eating oysters in Ireland. No defects in drains. „ 9. Eltham Road—Also attributed to eating oysters. Not due to drains. „ 10. Eltham Road.—Came into the district from Ealing with the disease upon him. The friends of No. 2 would not allow him to be removed to Hospital. If this had been done promptly, the other three cases in Pelham Terrace would not, in all probability, have occurred. Erysipelas. 8. 13 cases were notified; but fortunately none of them were of a serious nature. It was not possible to connect them with any insanitary surroundings of the patients. Puerperal Fever. 9. Two cases were reported, neither of which was due to defective drainage. In one case a woman gave birth to a decomposed fœtus, which caused blood-poisoning, and death. The other was attributed to contagion, but recovered. 56 The Cottage Hospital. 10. In my report for 1895-6, I mentioned that in consequence of complaints of illness which had occurred in the Hospital, which could only be attributed to its insanitary condition, you had called upon the Committee to reconstruct the drains, This was done, but in spite of that some of the patients did not get on well ; and at last the matron became seriously ill from bloodpoisoning, and had to leave. In consequence, I made a special report to the Hospital Committee, with your concurrence, to the effect that the building, which had been constructed for another purpose, was unfit to be used as an hospital. More especially in consequence of the small size of the wards, which only allowed 615 cubic feet of air space for each bed; whereas it is generally admitted that at least from 1,200 to 1,500 ought to be allowed in hospitals, with as much as 2,000 for severe surgical cases. The Committee have wisely determined to build a new Hospital, on another site, as soon as the necessary funds can be obtained; and have decided to admit only half the usual number of patients to the present building, until that can be done. Jubilee Cottages. 11. The defects in the water supply, mentioned in my last report, have been remedied. A Mortuary and Post Mortem Room. 12. In consequence of representations made by the Coroner, the County Council called upon you to provide the above, in accordance with the piovisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891. At your request 1 have had interviews with the Medical 57 Officers and other Officials of the L.C.C.; and, in November, I arranged a meeting between them and a deputation from you, at Spring Gardens, when the matter was fully discussed. Section 88 of the aforesaid Act ordains that:—"Every sanitary authority shall provide a fit and proper place for the reception of dead bodies before interment," so that they may not become a nuisance. Section 90 enacts that "Any Sanitary Authority may, and, if required by the County Council, shall, provide and maintain a proper building for the reception of dead bodies during the time required to conduct a post mortem examination ordered by the Coroner." Also that "Any such building may be provided in connection with a mortuary." Section 92 enacts further that:— "The County Council shall provide and maintain proper accommodation for holding of inquests," which may be in connection with the mortuary and post mortem room. The need for such a building, in Eltham, does not appear to be very urgent, as, according to the returns furnished to me by the Registrar, during the three years I have been Medical Officer of Health, the average number of inquests has been two per annum, and of postmortem examinations less than one (see table). Still I suppose the law must be complied with, and I beg to suggest that the test solution of the difficulty would be for the parishes of Lee and Eltham to join together and erect a building somewhere between the two. This arrangement would satisfy the Acts, I am informed, as it only appears to require that one such building shall be provided by a Sanitary Authority. The County Council might then have their Coroner's Court in the same building, for which they would pay rent; and I understand that they are prepared to lend money for the work if necessary. Lee certainly has a room for the purpose, but it is at the Cemetery, at Hither Green, a long way from the centre of the parish and must be very inconvenient for Jurors. 58 An "Obnoxious " Pond.* 13. Complaints were made, in the summer, of smells arising from an "Obnoxious" pond, in a field, at the back of some houses in Southwood Road, and of illnesses arising therefrom. As these complaints appeared to be well founded, and the water was very foul smelling and crowded with Animalculæ, an order was obtained, in July, from the Magistrate, at Woolwich police court, that the pond should be drained and filled up in a month. From time to time the Sanitary Inspector has reported that the filling up was going on; but that he believed the owner had found it impossible to literally comply with the order of the Magistrate, in consequence of the difficulty in getting a proper quantity of earth A complaint has been again made, this time to the Local Government Board, that the pond is still a nuisance and had not been filled up at the end of the year. I find that a great deal has been done to it, for it is now three parts full; and the owner declares that he has carted into it upwards of 1,000 loads of earth At the present time I do not think that what is left of it is a nuisance; but it may become so when hot weather sets in. You have consequently called upon the owner to finish the filling in forthwith. Insanitary Dwellings. Pelham Terrace. 14 Two years ago, at your request, I made a special report on the state of this row of 26 houses, at New Eltham, in consequence of complaints which had been made, that they were "Unfit for human habitation". I found that the rooms were large, for this class of Cottage, and that the arrangement of the drains was good. They had however been allowed to fall into a sad * "This has been filled up since the above was written." 59 state of repair and were an eyesore to the neighbourhood. Acting upon my suggestion you called upon the Landlord to remedy numerous defects, which were likely to prove injurious to health. Complaints were again made last autumn, by the Coroner and his Jury, of the bad state of the houses, and, at your request, I have again made a series of examinations of them, with the Surveyor and Sanitary Inspector. We found that many of the defects, pointed out in my former report, had been remedied, and the landlord's agents state that they have spent more than £200 on the premises. Of course the Sanitary Authority, cannot interfere with the "Decorative repairs" of the Cottages; but we have pointed out some still existing defects, which would be likely to prove injurious to health and notice has been given to put them right. After the first batch of repairs had been called for, the landlord increased the rents of most of the Cottages one shilling per week so that many of the inhabitants appear to wish we had not interfered. This exemplifies one of the difficulties which a Sanitary Authority meets with in administering the law. They frequently get blamed on one hand for not doing enough and on the other for their "interfering ways." I may perhaps take this opportunity of saying that I have always found you most attentive to any representations I may have thought it necessary to make, as to Sanitary improvements required; whilst you have been, at the same time, careful not to give unnecessary trouble or expense to owners of property. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, THOMAS MOORE, D.P.H. Cambridge. 60 Deaths in "Outlying Institutions" of Persons belonging to the District. No. Date. Place of Death. Sex.

Gentlemen, I beg to submit the following Report of the various duties and works performed, so far as relates to my department for Eltham Parish. Sewage, Drainage and Cesspools. 1. The sewers generally throughout the Parish have been cleansed and flushed by means of automatic syphon flushing tanks and by the flushing van. 66 2. The various sewer ventilators have been kept in order and no smells arising from manhole or ventilator covers have been perceptible from the Board's sewers. 3. Complaints having been received of smells arising from the open manhole cover of the London County Council's Sewer in Mottingham Road, the Engineer to the Council was communicated with, who had the manhole cover complained of sealed up and a 6-inch ventilating pipe erected against a tree in the adjoining field. 4. A partial blockage having occurred in the 12-inch pipe sewer in Park Place, it was opened up for 12 feet, the blockage removed and the pipes relaid. 5. Plans and sections of a new sewer in the Green Lane from Foots Cray Road, southwards to the Railway Bridge over the South Eastern Railway, have been prepared together with the estimate specification and apportionment and for which the consent of the London County Council has been obtained. This sewer will consist of about 815 feet of 15-inch and 815 feet of 12-inch stoneware pipes, laid on 6 inches cement concrete and half embedded in same.; together with 6 manholes, 4 gullies, with 6-inch pipe connections, an automatic flushing tank and a steel ventilating column 6 inches in diameter and 30 feet in height from the ground line. The average depth of the sewer will be about 10 feet. 6. Fifty-three notices and Plans of intention to drain have been received during the year, and the works have been supervised by the officers of the Board. 67 7. A complaint having been received of cesspools overflowing on to Eltham Common in rear of Shooters' Hill National School, notice was served on the owner to cut off the overflow pipe from the cesspools, which was complied with and the overflow ditch cleaned out. 8. Complaints having been received about emptying cesspools in the daytime instead of at night, Bexley, Plumstead, and Charlton Parishes were asked if they could empty the cesspools at night, instead of in the daytime as formerly. They replied that it was not their custom to empty cesspools at night and Bexley refused to do so, stating that there was no nuisance from their emptying cesspools in the daytime; Plumstead and Charlton contenting themselves by stating that this could be done, but at an increased cost. 9. Ten cesspools lave been emptied by the Bexley apparatus, 1 by the Plumstead apparatus and 7 by the Charlton apparatus at a total cost of £33 5s. 0d;, most of the cesspools being situated on Shooters' Hill. 10. The London County Council having prepared draft Byelaws with the object of obtaining uniformity in the construction of drainage works, and having sent a copy to the Board for their observations, thereon, we (the Surveyors) carefully went through the proposed Bye-laws and suggested several amendments which were accepted and dealt with by you. 11. It is with difficulty that Builders can be got, to have the drainage works they may be laying or repairing left open for 68 inspection; they or their workmen, in numerous instances, partially or wholly covering up their work so that it is impossible to inspect the drains satisfactorily, and causing a needless amount of trouble and friction. If the amendments suggested in the preceding paragraph are accepted by the London County Council much will have been done to remedy this, and it would help the work of the department if the Board would make an order that all drainage works constructed by any person, whether only repairs or alterations, as well as new drains, that such persons be required to obtain a certificate of final inspection. Gullies. 12. The gullies throughout the Parish have been cleansed regularly, flushed, and disinfected. 13. Two new gullies have been constructed in the Eltham Road to replace old and defective gullies. Disinfecting. 14. £43 2s. 9d. has been spent for disinfecting purposes; £33 12s. 0d. of this amount having been paid to Plumstead Vestry for disinfecting bedding, in their disinfecting apparatus. Dusting. 15. This is done by contract for the sum of £180 per annum by Mr. G. Humphrey, of New Eltham. No complaints having been received of non-removal. 69 16. Tarpaulin covers have been supplied to all the dustcarts during the year. Highways. 17 The following quantities of road material have been put on Eltham Road, High Street, Foots Cray Road, Bexley Road, Victoria Road, Shooters' Hill, Woolwich Road, Court Road, Green Lane, Mottingham Road, Southwood Roads, East and West, and North Park:— Granite 807 cubic yards. Basalt 941 „ Hand-picked Flints 895 „ 18. The binding material used with the above was sweepings from the flint roads, collected from time to time and stored, and the whole was consolidated with the steam roller. 19. Under an agreement with the "Crown," the Board has kerbed and channelled and made up the path on the East side of Court Road, in front of the house called "New Haven," at a cost of £49 15s. 3d., which amount has been paid by the Crown agents. 20. 416 feet of 12" by 8" flat Guernsey kerb and 45 tons of 4" by 6" Guernsey granite pitchers, on 4 inches cement concrete, have been laid in the Eltham Road, between "Harrowfield," and The Avenue, to replace the old and broken Purbeck kerbing and channelling, already there, and the path has been made good to the new kerbing with tartopping. 70 21. Now that the Shooters' Hill is getting a thorough coating of metal the crossing there was found to be too low, which has now been raised on 6 inches cement concrete and makes an improvement in the roadway. 22. An application was made to make up and take over " The Avenue," of which plans and sections were prepared, but the majority of the owners being against this, no further action was taken. 23. The South Metropolitan Gas Company have laid the following new Gas Mains during the year:— An 18-inch main on the South side of Eltham Road from Lee Green to Mottingham Road, to take the place of an existing 10-inch main, which was removed. A 12-inch main from Mottingham Road to Court Yard on the North side of Eltham Road and High Street. A 6-inch main from Victoria Road on the North side of High Street as for the Reservoir gate and connected to the 3-inch main that goes along the Bexley Road. A 4-inch main from Victoria Road on the South side of High Street and joining the 3-inch main in Southend Road. 24. As the charges hitherto paid to the Board by the Gas and Water Companies for repairs to roads, broken up by them, have been considered inadequate, we (the Surveyors) prepared schedules shewing the estimated cost of repairing the roads. 71 These schedules being accepted by the Board, have been forwarded to the Gas and Water Companies as the prices to be charged to them in future; but the Companies have not yet decided on their course of action in this matter. 25. The London County Council having decided to pay the increased charge for repairs to the Highway over Eltham Green Bridge, as from the 25th March, 1897, representations were made to them that as the roadway had been repaired last year at the increased cost of £67 2s. 1d., so the increased amount should be paid for that year, which has now been done. 26. The narrow foot planks across the ditch in Eltham Road, the River Quaggy in the line of the footpath from Mottingham Road, to West Chislehurst Park, and across the ditch in line of King John's Walk, have been improved, widened, and strong hand-rails fixed for the protection of the public. The cost being £16 L3s. 5d. 27. Numerous applications for road breaking, etc., have been received during the year. These have been repaired by your own men, with the exception of the Gas Company's trenches, who repair their own work. Amounts are as follows:— £ s. d. Trench openings 19 15 1 Emptying cesspools 12 7 6 Miscellaneous 30 4 3 Kent Water Company 12 6 6 Hoard Licenses 5 0 £74 18 4 72 28. The Highways, Streets, and Footpaths, about 16 miles of roads, have been regularly swept, both by hand and horse broom. 12 miles of roads in this Parish are principal roads, having a constant through traffic from London to the country and entail a heavy amount of care and supervision with a small staff of workmen, to successfully cope with the work of cleansing, metalling, and repairing the same. 29. About 12 miles of paths have been tarred and dressed over with sand. 30. Part of the old brick culvert in Southwood Road, East, fell in during the year ; as it was not in a condition to stand repairing, a small manhole was constructed at the spot, which is now convenient for cleansing purposes. 31. A part of the ditch in front of Eltham Common, Shooters' Hill, has been piped in with 9-inch pipes, and the best of the old kerb and channel removed from the Eltham Road has been fixed in front, so as to give an abutment to the road metal and to prevent the steam roller from crushing in the bank of the ditch. 32. The Railway Embankment in Court Road having been gradually sinking, the South Eastern Railway were requested to make good the bank, so as to prevent damage to the footpath and this they have now done. 35. Where trees and hedges have generally been dangerous, where over hanging the paths or roadway, letters have been written to the various occupiers asking them to have the hedgesor trees cut back. 73 Snow Removal. 34. During the last winter 180 loads of snow were removed from the roads and the pavements swept, and 257 loads of sand were spread on the roads and footpaths, at a total cost of £47 17s. 7d. The sand used for this purpose being the sweepings from the flint roads which is collected in summer time and stored. Lighting. 35. The gas lighting throughout the Parish is contracted for by the South Metropolitan Gas Compy., there being 102 ordinary lamps at £3 3s. 9d. each per annum, 82 lamps at £3 13s. 9d., 4 lamps at £4 3s. 9d., 1 lamp at £5 3s. 9d., 1 lamp at £5 12s. 0d., and 1 Sugg's at £8 15s. 9d. 36. One new lamp has been erected in the Meadowcourt Road. 37. Numerous complaints have been made both as to the quality and pressure of gas supplied, and the London County Council was asked to approach the Gas Referees to have a public gas testing station in Eltharn. Watering. 38. The streets and roads have been periodically watered in the season by the Board's own horses and vans for a length of 8¼ miles by water from the Kent Water Company's mains, at the contract rate of £25 per mile. 74 39. Where necessary the hydrants have been repaired and kept in order. 40. To facilitate the watering of Shooters' Hill, and as the water vans were too heavy for the horses going up such a steep gradient, a new water cart with box spreader was purchased for £21 10s. Od. General. 41. One of your horses which had been in the employment of the Board for the last tea years, having got beyond heavy work, was sold and a new horse purchased. 42. The old horse broom having become quite worn out and beyond repair a new horse broom was purchased from Messrs. W. Smith & Sons, of Barnard Castle, at a cost of £26 10s. Od. 43. The stone carts, slop carts, and water vans, as far as necessary, have been repaired and repainted, and new hose for the water vans has been provided. 44. The boundary stone in Halfway Street having got displaced, attention was drawn to this by the Ordnance Survey Department, and the stone has now been refixed in its proper position. 45.
