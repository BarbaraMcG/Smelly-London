The number of deaths is not above the average for the month (during the last five years), after calculating for increase in population, but greatly above the number of last year, when only twenty-nine deaths were registered. Five deaths have taken place from zymotic disease, namely— 8th April. Measles, Silver Street, Lewisham. 9th „ Fever, Southend. 12th „ Measles, Loampit Hill, Lewisham. 12th „ Diptheria, Rushey Green, Lewisham. 16th „ Measles, Brockley. Five deaths have taken place from phthisis, tubercular disease of the lungs. Six have taken place from inflammation of the air passages. The cold and variable weather has prejudicially affected the very young and the very old, thus— Seventeen infants have died under 4 years of age. Eight persons have died above the age of 70 and 80 years. The month has not been a healthy one, a great deal of sickness having prevailed in a greater or less degree. Three cases of smallpox have occurred in Loate's Pits, Blackheath. A few cases of scarlet fever have occurred. Measles and hooping cough are very prevalent throughout the district. Fever still exists at Southend, though modified in degree. A case of the same kind of fever brought from Southend also lies at Bell Green. I wish to remind you that the offensive smell from the drainage of two houses running into the ditch bounding the North Surrey School is unabated; also that the state of the roads at the back of the Foresters' Inn and "West Kent Park is still dangerous to passengers, and injurious to the health of the inhabitants.

The mortality has thus been below the average of the last five years, and the inhabitants of the district have, since my last report, considerably improved in health. Four deaths have occurred from zymotic disease during the month, namely— 24th April. Scarlet fever, Shepherd's Place, Lewisham. 23rd „ Measles, Cross Street, Lewisham. 9th May. Bilious fever, Lewis Grove, Lewisham. 16th „ Scarlet fever, Blackheath Hill. No zymotic disease has been extensively prevalent; but a few cases of scarlet fever and measles have occurred sporadically. I have to call your attention to a few nuisances prejudicial to health which require remedying, namely— The sewage from 'houses situate close to Forest Hill church (in Dartmouth Park) runs openly down the valley and discharges itself into the ditch in Perry Yale, passing in its course two houses, to the inhabitants of which it is a dangerous nuisance. An offensive pond of stagnant water lies at the back of Emerson Terrace. Some of the land in Stanstead and Brockley Lanes is also marshy, from an accumulation of water, which is prevented running from the land in consequence of the elevation of the footpath. Malaria will rise when the sun's rays partially dry this locality ; and already two cases of ague have occurred in the adjoining neighbourhood. The drainage of a part of the Laurie Road has hitherto been conveyed underneath the railway into a pond upon Mr. W. Smith's property, where it has deposited and become diluted and partially oxydized. The pond overflows into ditches running across Penge Lane, and thence in open ditches at the back of the property upon the south side of Lower Sydenham, where it appears to have been little noticed. Mr. Smith has recently diverted the sewage from the pond, and it will now run undiluted in the course named, and must become a most aggravated nuisance. If no sewer can be constructed, a deodorizing tank should, at all events, be placed here. 12 The sewer intended to meet the Upper Norwood line, and thus remove a large quantity of sewage allowed to accumulate upon the north west side of the Anerly water, has been conveyed through the Anerly Gardens to the south east side of this portion of canal; but it would be extremely dangerous, at this time of year, to drain the water off for tho purpose of continuing tho sewer across, as it would expose a large quantity of mud mixed with deposit from sewage, which, when acted upon by the sun's rays, would be poisonous to the inhabitants of the district adjoining. A sewer is required along the Anerly Road on either side of the railway; there arc many good houses here with no system of drainage. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

'faking into consideration the increase of population, the mortality of the district has not been above the average of the last five years, although in the Penge ward an unusual number of deaths (ten) has been recorded. Six deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— 2nd June. Smallpox, King Street, Blackheath. 7th „ Fever, Blackheath Hill. 11th „ Measles, Lewisham. 13th „ Measles, Penge. 13th „ Ditto, ditto. 13th ,, Ditto, ditto. Several cases of measles have occurred in the district; but, with these exceptions, we are remarkably free from epidemic disease. One case of smallpox has been admitted into the Union Workhouse, also a case of measles and scarlet fever; but all these have been sent in from parts of the Union beyond this district. 13 Owing to the great quantity of rain which has fallen, the atmosphere has been in an extremely damp state, its greatest point of saturation having been reached upon Saturday, 16th. Mumps, a disease dependant apparently upon a moist atmosphere for its development, has been prevalent in the district. The drainage of the marshy land at the back of the Anerly School has been attended to, but not satisfactorily completed. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual.

The health of the district, as thus evidenced by the returns of mortality, has a very favourable aspect, the deaths are considerably below the average for the month; and from other reliable sources of information, I am happy to communicate the fact that the district is very healthy at the present time. One death only has taken place from epidemic disease during the month, namely— Female, 1 year, measles, Penge. Several cases of smallpox have been reported to me in the district; some have occurred in Russell Street, Sydenham, and others in Loampit Yale, Lewisbam ; two cases have also been admitted to the Union Workhouse, but the disease has not spread .N o vehicle has yet been provided for the conveyance of persons affected with infectious diseases of this kind ; the street cabs are therefore still in use in this district, and must thus endanger the public health, and tend to the spread of disease. I find, upon enquiry, that the Hospital for Smallpox at Holloway is full, and that cases of this disease are not now admitted at many of the London hospitals. An accumulation of offensive drainage still exists at Anerly. A house occupied by Mr. Haughton, Stanstead Lane, and others, is not drained into the sewer. Many of the houses at Loampit Vale are not yet supplied with water. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual. 14 METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. "Weight of air.

Typhoid fever, Orchard Place. Five or six cases of smallpox have occurred in the district, but only two (above mentioned) have proved fatal. Diarrhoea has attacked a few persons, but a very small amount as compared with the number usually affected in every place in the summer season, when the temperature is more elevated. I wish again to direct your attention to the state of Orchard Place, in which there are ten inhabited houses. Several cases of typhoid fever have occurred here, and are still occurring (one death I have mentioned above from this cause), and are attributed, by the medical men in attendance, to the impure water supply and general want of proper drainage and cleanliness. The inhabitants are solely dependant for their water supply upon the small river Poole, as no other supply can be obtained by them for nearly half a mile. This small 15 river contains a large amount of sewage from the Crystal Palace and a large number of houses, with also an evident contamination with gas refuse from the works at Bell Green. I examined the water again yesterday, and, although an unusual quantity of water was running, it was decidedly unfit for use in any way. A well should be dug to supply the houses, or some other means adopted to relieve the number of persons resident here. The closets also require more frequent emptying. A large number of houses situated in Anerly Vale, at the back of the Rising Sun Inn, are insufficiently drained, and require attention. The well at No. 34 contains sewage, and is unfit for use. Sewage, of the most offensive description, has been running by the side of the road at the south end of the Crystal Palace. The Company should be compelled to drain.

The health of the district during the past four weeks has, as usual at this time of the year, borne a favourable aspect. Seventy.six births and thirty.four deaths have been registered during the month. Of the deaths, two have occurred from inflammation of the air passages, seven from consumption of the lungs, and six from zymotic disease. The localities in which the latter have occurred are enumerated below, thus— 25th Aug. Measles, Camden Cottages, Blackheath. 1st Sept. Typhoid fever, Dartmouth Place, Blackheath. 18th „ Ditto, Osborne Cottages, Blackheath. 23rd Aug. Ditto, Orchard Place, Sydenham. 30th „ Ditto, Verey's Cottages, Sydenham. 15th Sept. Scarlatina, Blythe Hill, Sydenham. None of the above diseases are, however, prevalent at the present time. 10 A small amount of diarrhoea has been noticed; also hooping cough, which has affected a few of the children at the North Surrey School. I wish to re.direct your attention to the mass of sewage flowing into the Poole and Ravensbourne rivers, and which is continually increasing in quantity as houses are built. The drainage of the Crystal Palace, of the greater portion of Upper Norwood, of the whole of Penge, and of Perry Vale, Sydenham (along which the sewage still runs in an offensive open ditch), finds its way into these rivers. The Kent Water Company fortunately have constructed an artesian well, which renders them less dependant upon the river supply, and are very particular as to filtration, or more evil results would be perceptible from this source. It is known that a contaminated water supply is capable of producing typhoid fever, and other formidable diseases. The drainage of West Kent Park also requires your attention : the surface drainage is bad, the roads are bad, the sewage is not well removed, the gullies are broken, the gully holes are open and offensive; and it is one of the most unhealthy parts of the district. Several cases of scarlet fever occurred in the early part of the month in a court opposite the Dolphin Inn, Lower Sydenham. The house requires cleaning and lime whiting, and water supply attended to. The house occupied by Mr. Remington, postman, Lower Sydenham, and the adjacent houses, require draining into the sewer, and proper closets and water supply. The above property is nearly opposite Mr. Cator's, New Road; the first is adjoining property belonging to Mr. Wilson. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality arc appended as usual.

The average death rate for the past five years, during this month, has been 29.2; therefore, taking into consideration the increase of population, the number for the present month is considerably below the average. I am happy to be able to inform you that no death has taken place from epidemic disease during the month. One death (in the zymotic class) has taken place from erysipelas. Measles has been epidemic in Sydenham. Hooping cough is also endemic at the North Surrey District School. The matters principally demanding your attention are— The dilapidated state of some dwelling houses at Ladywell, also near Mr. Robinson's mill at Lewisham. The state of roads and drainage at "West Kent Park, Sydenham. Also in the "Willow Road, where pigs are kept much to the annoyance of the adjoining neighbours in Sydenham Park.

The mortality of the district has been below the average, calculated for the last five years, even without taking into consideration the increase of population. 18 Seven deaths have been registered from epidemic disease, namely— 2nd Nov. Hooping cough, Paragon Mews, Blackheath. 6th „ Typhus fever, Upper Sydenham. 15th „ Typhoid fever, Rock Hill, Upper Sydenham. 5th „ Fever, Penge. 17th „ Scarlet fever, Penge. 20th „ Ditto, ditto. 20th „ Malignant sore throat, Rushey Green, Lewisham. Four deaths have taken place from inflammation of the lungs. Eight deaths have taken place from consumption of the lungs. A woman, aged 63, died of gangrene, consequent upon fracture of the thigh bone. A child, 1 year old, died of malignant disease of the skin. Hooping cough is somewhat prevalent, and a few cases of scarlet fever have appeared in the less favoured localities situated in Penge and Sydenham. I have received complaints of the undermentioned nuisanccs, requiring your order for their removal:— Offensive overflowing privy, Bradshaw's, opposite the Sydenham Police Station; Cleave, landlord. This requires filling in, and draining into the sewer. Sion House, near the Church, Lewisham: nuisance from overflowing cesspool upon the neighbours' premises. The Drift Way, Lewisham: want of drainage. Offensive manure heaps, near the Police Station, Lewisham. These heaps vary in quantity, and are at times very offensive. The accumulation of water upon the Building Land, in Stanstead Lane, overflows and destroys the footpath, and renders it almost impassable. The neighbourhood of these large pools of water must be damp and unhealthy. The footpaths in Sydenham and Penge are many of them in a very filthy state, and detrimental to health; and it remains to be considered whether some more permanent pavement, in the most frequented parts, would not be cheaper, and contribute to the health of the passengers. Meteorological tables and tables of mortalitv are appended as usual. METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. Week ending. Weight of air. Barometer corrected. Mean inches. Temperature of Air. Thermometer.

The mortality in Lewisham has been about the average of the last five years; in Blackheath and in Penge it has been above the average; and in Sydenham considerably below the average. Five deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, thus— 3rd Dec. Diptheria, Lewis Grove, Lewisham. 10th „ Hooping Cough, Blackheath. 6th „ Diarrhoea, Russell Street, Sydenham. 28th „ Measles, Upper Norwood, Penge. 15th „ Diptheria, Penge. Six deaths have occurred in those above 70 years of age, and the death of one centenarian is registered as having occurred at Blackheath. Twelve deaths have occurred amongst children under 1 year old. Five deaths have been registered from pulmonary consumption. Six deaths have been registered from inflammation of the air passages. One death from suicide (cut throat) occurred in Guy's Hospital, brought from Penge, to a stable keeper at the latter place (some years ago a livery stable keeper in Sydenham). It is remarkable, that although the temperature has been considerably lower than has been known for many years, yet the specific mortality usually resulting from a low temperature has not sensibly increased; but it remains to be seen whether future reports will shew the result to have been pernicious to the health of the population of this district. Epidemic disease has not been prevalent, but cases of hooping cough have occured in various parts of the district. Cases of measles have also occurred in Penge ; and cases of hooping cough and scarlet fever have occurred in the North Surrey District School (Anerly). During the past year, only two deaths have occurred in the above establishment, which now numbers 713 children. Meteorological tables and tables of mortality are appended as usual.

This number is a little in excess of the average for the last six years. The inclement weather has proved fatal principally at the extremes of life, thus— Fourteen deaths have occurred in those above 70th years of age, and sixteen deaths amongst children under 5 years of age. Twelve deaths have taken place from inflammation of the air passages, and two (not included amongst these) from pulmonary consumption. Two deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— Jan. 1. Diptheria, Penge. Jan. 21. Hooping cough, Sydenham. I have again to bring under your notice the offensive state of the ditches in Perry Vale and Meadow Croft, Sydenham. I have also received several complaints of nuisance arising from keeping pigs to the annoyance of the neighbouring inhabitants: thus—in Willow Walk, Lewisham; at Mr. Smith's, near the Post Office, Rushey Green; in Willow Walk, Sydenham, &c. &c.; and it remains for you to decide as to what interference should take place in this matter, as it has several times been brought under your notice, and no remedy applied.

The mortality thus noted is below the average for the month, the calculated average for February, during the last six years, being 34.7. 21 Four deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— Diptheria, Lewis Grove, Lewisham. Hooping cough, Mill Cottages, Lewisham. Diarrhoea, Penge. Diptheria, Penge. During the last few months, several cases of diptheria have occurred in Penge. The one above reported is also the second occurring in Lewis Grove since the 17th of December last. Four deaths have occurred from inflammation of the lungs, and four deaths from consumption; thirteen deaths have occurred in children under 2 years of age, four in those above 70. Hooping cough is prevalent in the district; several cases of measles have also occurred during the month. It is proposed to burn a large quantity of bricks upon a piece of land in Jasmine Grove, Penge, owned by Mr. Mahony, Cobourg Place, Old Kent Road. If this is allowed to take place, it will be a great nuisance to the neighbouring inhabitants, and is, in my opinion, detrimental to health. The piece of water at Anerly, near the down side of the London and Brighton railway, is in a most offensive and dangerous condition. An offensive closet, without water supply, within a few feet of the public road, was complained of by me in the "complaint book," since which something has been done, but no proper means have been taken to remedy the nuisance which still remains—an offensive and undrained cesspool, without water supply, at Mr. Russell's, watchmaker, Sydenham.

Three deaths have taken place from epidemic disease, namely— 3rd March. Dysentery, Homesdale, Lewisham. 13th „ Diarrhoea, Price's Cottages, Lewisham. 9th „ Enteric fever, Sydenham Hill. Two deaths have taken place from inflammation of the air passages, and two from consumption. Measles and hooping cough arc somewhat prevalent, but not of a severe kind. Offensive sewage still permeates the open ditches along Perry Vale, Sydenham. The roads in West Kent Park are still quite impassable in some parts, and the gullies are broken in, open, and offensive; the locality is damp and unwholesome, both from these causes and from the undrained state of the land. Pigs are kept in an offensive manner, and are an unwholesome nuisance near dwelling houses, opposite the Rising Sun Inn. The large quantities of burning ballast adjoining inhabited houses near the Forest Hill Station, and at Anerly, is prejudicial to the comfort and health of the inhabitants.
