REPORT ON THE SANITARY STATE HACKNEY DISTRICT, TOE THE YEAE 1872, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., ETC., Author of Essags on Scarlatina and its Etiology ; Scarlatinal Dropsy ; the Relative Mortalities of Male and Female Children, &c. PRESIDENT OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY; MEDTCAL OFFICER OF TO THE DISTRICT. Printed by order of the Board by andrew t. roberts 5, hackney road, london. 1873. REPORT. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, I propose in this report to lay before you not only the sanitary state of the District during 1872, and the work carried on by myself and staff, but also to tabulate the births and deaths for some years past, and to discuss some of the tables and data set out in the two volumes of the Census lately published by the Registrar General's department. The mortality during the year has been unusually small, although there were a very large number of deaths from smallpox, and, as I foretold last year, a comparatively large number from measles. This has arisen partly in consequeuce of the mortality from scarlet fever having been the smallest which has been registered since the framing of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," due allowance being made for increase of population. I stated in my last report that I expected a very small mortality from scarlet fever in 1872 and 1873, and so far my expectations have been verified. The total number of deaths registered in this district during 1872, exclusive of 303 non-residents who died in the small-pox and fever hospitals at Homerton, was 2,487, which, allowing the number of inhabitants 4 to have been 131,167 on the first clay of July, would give ten deaths for each 527 inhabitants, or 189 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants. If we exclude the deaths which were registered in the East London Union, and the population also, we have 10 deaths in each 531 inhabitants, or 188 deaths per 10,000 residents. This is the smallest death rate I have ever reported for this district, and is less than that for all London, or for the Northern districts generally, as the rate for the metropolis was 214, and for the Northern districts 211 per 10,000 inhabitants. Not only, however, was the death-rate unusually small, but the number of births was large—namely, 4,338, which was at the rate of 172 births to each 100 deaths, being the largest proportion of births to deaths since 1852. In the whole metropolis there were 165 births to each 100 deaths. I shall now lay before you a table of the number of births in each sub-district and in each quarter.

That there were 368 births registered in Stoke Newington, 219 in Stamford Hill, 1055 in West 5 Hackney, 1646 in Hackney, and 1050 in South Hackney. These numbers are in excess for the whole district, as compared with 1871, for in the latter year 316 were registered in Stoke Newington, 204 in Stamford Hill, 971 in West Hackney, 1583 in Hackney, and 1074 in South Hackney, The increase of births was only at the rate of 23 per 1,000 above those of 1871, so that I may, perhaps, have calculated the increase of population at too great an amount. TABLE II. 1872.—Deaths in each Sub-District—52 Weeks. Quarters. Stoke Newingtn. Stamford Hill. West Hackney. Hackney. South Hackney. TOTALS.

The mean temperature of November was 3 degrees, and of December 3'8 degrees in excess of the mean of 101 years; and of November 1.7 degrees, and of December 2.7 degrees in excess of the average of the last 31 years as observed at Greenwich, I pointed out in previous reports that the observations taken at Greenwich exhibit a greater range of temperature than in Hackney, but that the mean temperature is about 0.3 of a degree below that for Hackney, so that the Greenwich records may be considered as fairly representing those for Hackney. 6 The next highest mortality occurred in the third quarter, viz., 618, and the lowest in the second, viz., 556. There were 191 deaths registered in Stoke Newington, 121 in Stamford Hill, 568 in "West Hackney, 1038 in Hackney, and 569 in South Hackney. This number of 1038 registered in the Hackney sub.division does not properly belong to it, as the deaths in the Hackney "Workhouse, the City of London Union, the German Hospital, the deaths of parishioners in the Fever and Small.Pox Hospitals, and some other institutions, are included therein. It would be necessary to extract the deaths in these Institutions, to eliminate those in the City of London Union, and then to spread the deaths in all the others, pro rata to the population, over the other sub.districts. As allowance would also have to be made for the population of the institutions varying each year, and to deduct that of the City of London Union, it would scarcely be possible to arrive at a correct conclusion, and I have, therefore, not attempted it, especially as very little benefit would have resulted from the calculations.

Violence 80 3.1 3.7 TOTALS 2487 100 100 7 Table 3 is one of much importance, as it shows the rate of death from all the chief groups under which deaths are registered in this country. The diseases included in each class will be found set out in the tables at the end of the report, so that I need not enumerate them here; suffice it to say, that class 1 includes diseases ordinarily termed epidemic, as well as diarrhoea and rheumatism (diseases which vary in frequency and fatality according to the temperature), erysipelas, croup, carbuncle, remittent fever, and a few others. The mortality from this class was 222 per 1000 deaths, against 212, which is the average in Hackney for the previous 16 years. This is not a large proportion of deaths from these causes when the extremely large number of deaths from small-pox, and the very small number of deaths from " old age " are taken into account. I mention the latter because it is veiy evident that if an unusually small number of deaths is registered from one disease, it must have the effect of increasing the percentages of deaths from other causes, even when the whole numbers are not greater than usual. The number of deaths from diseases of uncertain seat, viz., 120, bears the same average as for the 16 years, whilst that from tubercular diseases was 403, or 162 per cent, against an average of 16 9 per cent. This is satisfactory, as one good test of the salubrity of a district is the rate which deaths from consumption and other tubercular diseases bears to the total death rate. It is not, however, to be taken as an absolute rule that a low rate of death from these diseases is per se an indication of a healthy state of a locality, becauso a very large proportion of deaths from epidemic diseases, or of very young children (who comparatively rarely die from tubercular affections), would give a small percentage of deaths from tubercular and other affections, and thus lead to an erroneous opiuion as to the salubrity of the place. It is in fact difficult 8 to compare the salubrity of one district with another, for as I pointed out years ago, the mortality varies with the number of infants, middle-aged and old people, with the social status of the population as regards income, &c., also density of population, and especially overcrowding. Thus iu Hackney we should hardly have expected so low a death rate now as in 1851, when the proportion of servants and other middle-aged people, not likely to die in the district, was so much smaller then than now, and yet it is a fact that the death rate was smaller here in 1872 than in 1851, or any year, except 1850, which was near it. Diseases of the nervous system caused the death of 313 persons, or 12.5 per cent, which was above the average by 0.5 per cent. and affections of the circulatory organs produced 150 deaths, or 6 per cent. of the whole, which was also more than the mean. Diseases of the respiratory organs, excluding consumption, were fatal to no less thau 403 persons, which was at the rate of 16.2 per cent, or above au average. Affections of the digestive and urinary organs produced the death of 157 persons, or 6.3 per cent., which was a little above the mean, whilst no less than 147 deaths were registered as having been caused by premature birth and atrophy, or 5'9 per cent. against 5 5 per cent. in 16 years. The greatest difference from the mean occurred in the deaths from old age, as only 119 or 4-8 per cent. were registered from this cause against an average of 6.9 per cent. A reference to the ages at death for the years 1850-72 shows that this reduction arose only in a small ratio from the diminished number of deaths above 65, as in 1872 the rate was 9 4 per cent. against 10.1 per cent. for 1850-72, but was partly caused by a more correct registration of the causes of death. 9 TABLE IV. 1861-72—Deaths from Seven Epidemic Diseases.

It must not, however, be supposed that the difference is so great as appears here, because I have not been able to obtain the returns of deaths from small-pox in hospitals outside the district before 1871, and, therefore, although allowance was made in the total mortality, yet they were not included in this table. For future years, however, the number of deaths from small-pox of residents in the district will be comparable with those of 1871 and 1872. I may also mention that the number of deaths enumerated for 1871 and 1872 are those of residents only, as I have excluded 471 deaths of non-residents iu 1871, and 303 in 1872, which happened in the small-pox and fever hospitals. In my last report I stated that measles would probably prevail in 1872 and 1873, and so far my prognostication has proved correct, as 59 deaths were registered from-this disease against 25 in 1871, and 40 in 1870. As regards scarlet fever 10 I stated that a smaller mortality might be expected, and this table shows my forecast to have been correct, as 51 deaths only were registered against 85 iu 1871, 181 in 1870, and 247 in 1869. Whooping cough was very fatal, the death rate being greater than the corrected average of any year since the passing of the Metx-opolis Local Management Act, except in 1866 and 1869. The number of deaths from fever is larger than iu 1871, but is smaller than in any other year since 1856, due allowance being made for increase of population The number, 50, would have been less still if the Fever Hospital had not been in the district, for the same reasons as stated when speaking of small-pox. The mortality from diarrhoea was large, but not more than might have been expected, when the temperature of July, August, and September—and especially of July—is taken into consideration. TABLE V.

This is a very large proportion, and arises from the excessively large number of infants who died from whooping cough, small-pox, braiu disease, and premature birth and debility. There were 378 or 15.2 per cent. of deaths between 1 and 5 years old, 108 or 4.3 per cent. between 5 and 15, 129 or 5.4 per cent. between 15 11 and 25, 202 or 8.1 per cent. between 25 and 35, 191 or 7.7 per cent. between 35 and 45, 187 or 7.5 per cent. between 45 and 55, 177 or 7.l per cent. between 55 and 65, 240 or 9.6 per cent. between 65 and 75, 189 or no less than 7.6 per cent. between 75 and 85, and 46 or 1.8 per cent. of persons who died above 85 years, 3 of whom reached the patriarchal age of 95 and upwards. The proportion of deaths under 1 year in all London was 263 in each 1000, at all ages, so that the rate in Hackney, 256, although excessively high, was not so great as in London generally. A better test of the salubrity of the district is afforded by the rate of death, under 1 year, to all births, and this we find to be much more satisfactory as regards this district, for 147 deaths under 1 year were registered here out of each 1000 births, whilst in all London there were 159 of each 1000 births The death rate under 1 year to births was greater this year than in 1871 for all London as well as for Hackney— viz., 247 and 226 respectively, so that we have only suffered this year from causes which affected the whole metropolis. I now propose laying before you tables of the deaths of males and females at different ages for the 21 years, 1850-70. A comparison of the two shows that although the total number of deaths of females was iu excess of that of males, yet the difference was not sufficient to extend to every year of the period, although it happened in 15 out of the 21 years. It might have been expected that as there are on an average about 1000 male infants born to 961 females, that there would have been a larger number of male deaths than of females; and so there were during the first five years of life, as no less than 7417 deaths of males were registered against 6468 deaths of females under 5 years old. The greater number of deaths of 12 females arose from the larger proportion of females alive; as the census of 1851 showed that there were 33,346 females iu Hackney, to 25,083 males, and the census of 1861, that there were 47,337 females to 35,958 males. To a certain extent this great disproportion of females to males was caused by the very great preponderance of female to male servants. Thus iu 1851 there were 3914 female to 361 male servants; and 1861, there were 5271 female to 459 male servants. The total deaths of males in the 21 years were 18,135, aud of females, 18,521, so that the proportion of female deaths was nothing like so large as the ratio of female to male population. This arose again in part from the excess of female servants; for as a large number of them must have come from the country or other metropolitan districts, by far the largest proportion would, if attacked with illness, return to their homes, and not die in the district. But this will not account for anything like all the excess, as it has been known for very many years that a much larger rate of male than of female deaths happen in the first year of life, not only in England but abroad. Thus in my essay on the relative mortality of males and females, I showed that out of 3,329,412 deaths of childreu under 5 years in England, France, Belgium, Prussia, Sweden and Norway, no less than 1,781,073 were of males, against only 1,548,339 of females, or only 8,693 females to each 10,000 males. By examining the foreign tables to ascertain the ratio of female to male still-born children, I found that there were 723 females only to each 1000 males, and it is therefore evident that there exists a greater tendency to death in male than in female children. This is strengthened by the following table, which was compiled from 100,000 deaths, uuder 5 years, in England aud in the metropolis. 13 TABLE VI. England. London. Males. Females. Females. Males. Deaths from Zymotic diseases 100 98.8 97.1 100 ,, Tubercular diseases 100 84.9 82.3 100 ,, diseases of the Nervous system 100 76.2 79.5 100 „ ,, Respiratory organs 100 82.7 85.8 100 ,, Digestive organs ,, Atrophy 100 83.9 8l.2 100 100 89.0 90.1 100 premature birth 100 77.2 8o.6 100 ,, from all other diseases 100 83.8 86.9 100 800 676.3 683.5 800 The table proves that male children die at a greater rate from diseases of all kinds than females; that the proportion of deaths of females to males is greater in London than in all England, in all classes of disease except tubercular affections and diseases of the digestive organs. It also shows that if a male child is attacked with a disease of the nervous system he is likely to die from it, as compared with a female, as 100 chances are against 79, and if with other diseases, at the rate set out in the table against each class of disease. It is, therefore, necessary to exercise, if possible, more care in feeding, bringing up, and watching male than female children, in order to counteract the greater tendency to death which exists in the male child. The greater vitality of the female sex is indicated equally as strongly in advanced as in early life, as the tables show that 4530 females in this district lived to 65 years and upwards against 3095 males, or at the rate of 146 females to every 100 males. Now as at the census of 1861 there were only 129 females of all ages to each 100 males of all ages, it is quite evident that there must have been an excessive mortality of males at ages below 65 as compared with females. The difference is also shown even to a greater extent at the most advanced ages, as 572 females lived to 85 years and above, whilst only 241 males lived to such an extended period of human existence. Further, there were only 10 males to 36 females who lived for more than 95 years. 14 TABLE VII.— Males' Ages at Death. Registered in the Hackney District during the Years 1850-70.

As these calculations are based on above 36,000 deaths, and extend over 21 years, they may be taken as a fair average for Hackney, and will form a basis for comparison in future. I shall now proceed to consider the per-centages of the deaths of males and females for the years 1850-72 inclusive. The table indicates that during these years out of each 1000 deaths at all ages, 216 occurred during the first year of life, and 160 between 1 and 5 years of age, making 376 under 5 years old. That 58 deaths per 1000 happened between 5 and 15 years of age, 55 between 15 and 25, 72 between 25 and 35, the same number between 35 and 45, 74 between 45 and 55, 85 between 55 and 65, 105 between 65 and 75, 80 between 75 and 85, and no less than 23 above the very advanced age of 85. An analysis of the table also shows that whilst since 1862 there has not been a smaller rate of mortality under 1 year than 223 per 1000 deaths, yet before that period, and including that year, there was a smaller ratio in all years except 1858. The smallest rate was 173 per 1000 deaths in 1862, and the highest 256, which occurred in 1872. It is somewhat singular that the year in which the lowest rate of deaths under 1 year occurred should have been the one immediately preceding the years in which the death rate under 1 year became much higher, as in 1863 it was 224 per 1000 deaths; in 1864 it was 223; in 1865, 246; in 1866, 235; in 1867, 248; in 1868, 254; in 1869, 234; in 1870, 237; in 1871, 226; and in 1872, 256 per 1000 deaths. 17 The annual number of births has increased enormously since 1850, when it was only 1656, whilst in 1872 there were no less than 4338 births registered. The birth rate to population has increased considerably since 1851, as in that year there was only 1 birth to each 332 inhabitants, whilst in 1871 there was 1 birth to each 301 inhabitants. This, however, will not account for the whole change, especially as the proportion of deaths under 1 year to the number of infants registered is much smaller than for all London, being about 15 per cent. against about 17 per cent. for London. When the ages of the popidation of this district are published in the Census Tables, which, most probably, will not be for more than a twelvemonth, we may be able to account for these changes by comparing the returns for 1871 with the ages of the population in 1851 and 1861. In the four years which intervene between one and five years of age, 160 deaths took place out of each 1000, the smallest number being 133, and the highest 197 per 1000 deaths. There were only 58 in each 1000 deaths registered between the ages of 5 and 15, the largest proportion being 73, and the lowest, 40; between 15 and 25 the average was 58, the highest being 73, and the lowest, 42. Between 25 and 35 the average rate of death was 72—the highest being 96, and the lowest, 54; whilst between 35 and 45, when the average was the same as at the last period, the highest was 83, and the lowest, 60. Between 45 and 55 there were 74 deaths out of each 1000—the highest number being 88, and the lowest, 60. Between 55 and 65 there were no less than 85 out of each 1000 deaths—the highest rate being 102, and the lowest, 71, The next column of the table shows that on an average 10 J per cent. of all the deaths occurred between 65 and 75 years—the largest rate being 128, and the lowest, 87 per 1000. The table also shows that no less than 8 per cent. of the deaths happened above 75 years of age, which is a very large proportion at so advanced a period of life : the largest number was 100, and the lowest, 66 per 1000. There were 23 per 1000 deaths registered above 85 years—some of them above 100; indeed, with the exception of 1859 and 1871, one or more persons died at an age exceeding 95 in every one of these years. 18 TABLE IX.

The excessively high rate of death in 1871 was caused by the small-pox epidemic, and in 1869 by the great prevalence of scarlet fever. In 1860 the rate was but 168 per 1000 deaths, and was coincident with a low mean temperature for the year, and a cold, wet summer. There is no doubt that a cold, wet summer is favorable to health in London, not only as regards ordinary epidemic diseases, but also the mortality from all causes. The table shows that there were eight years in which the mortality from epidemic diseases was below, and nine in which it was above the mean of 212 per 1000 deaths from all causes. This mean per-centage is rather high, but is not so great as in all London. The deaths which are grouped together under the heading of "diseases of uncertain seat," which includes syphilis, privation, gout, dropsy, cancer, and mortification, varied between 41 and 60 per 1000 deaths from all causes, the average being 48. The next group is one of great importance, as it includes scrofula, tubercular diseases of the brain, lungs, and bowels. The mean number of deaths from these causes was 169 in each 1000—the highest number having been 200, and the lowest 147 in each 1000 deaths. The per-centage has been less of late years, with the exception of 1867 and 1868, than in 1856 and 1857, which is very satisfactory when the change in the condition of the population is taken into account. The high rate in 1867-68 was, to a great extent, correlative to the very small death rate from epidemic diseases. Deaths from diseases of the nervous system shows a rather high proportion, viz., 120 out of each 1000 deaths. The highest number was 140 in 1859, and the lowest 106 in 1871. This low rate in 1871 was caused by the excessive mortality from small-pox, as the total number of deaths in 1871 from these 21 causes was 303, and in 1870 it was 294, although the percentage in that year was 119 per 1000. The per.centage of deaths from affections of the heart and great vessels was 54 per 1000, the highest having heen 67, and the lowest 38, whilst the mean per.centage from diseases of the respiratory organs was no less than 160 per 1000, the lowest having heen 139, and the highest 191 per 1000 deaths from all causes. The death rate from affections of the lungs and vocal organs is so dependent on temperature that it is easy to calculate the number of deaths beforehand, if the mean temperature of each day in winter be given for two or three weeks. I do not mean to say that the excessive mortality which occurs from very severe weather in winter is confined to affections of the respiratory organs, because I have shown in other papers that it extends more or less to all the great groups of disease. Affections of the digestive and urinary organs produced an average mortality of 60 per 1000, the highest having been 69, and the lowest 52 per 1000 from all causes. The death rate from premature birth and atrophy was 54 per 1000; the highest was 76, and the lowest 42 per 1000 deaths from all causes. The deaths from old age averaged 68 per 1000; the highest ratio having been 79, and the lowest 48 per 1000. It will be noticed that the rate for the last two years is much below the average. The last group, viz., that of deaths from violence, shows that the number annually registered varied as little as for any other, the average having been 37—the highest 47, and the lowest 24 in 1000 deaths from all causes. Having now concluded our resume of the mortality tables for past years, I shall proceed to briefly consider some of the facts ascertained by the last and previous censuses. 22 TABLE XI.

In 1811 the population numbered 18,920, being an increase of nearly 5,000 in the ten years, Hackney having advanced by more than 4,000, and Stoke Newington not quite 700. In 1821 the population was 25,170, of which 22,494 belonged to Hackney, and 2,676 to Stoke Newington, the increase being but a little more than 6,000 in the ten years. In 1831 there were 34,527 residents in the District, being an excess of more than 9,000 persons. Between 1831 and 1841 the increase was not so great as in the previous decade, as the population was only 42,261 against the 34,527. At the Census of 1851 there were 58,429 residents; so that there were above 16.000 persons more than in 1841, and nearly the whole of this large number belonged to Hackney, as in 1841 the population was 37,771, and in 1851 no less than 53,589. The Census of 1861 shows that a greater stride still had been taken, as there were no less than 83,295 persons in the District, being an addition of nearly 25,000; and at the 23 last Census the numbers in Hackney were 115,110, and in Stoke Newington, 9,841, making a total of 124,951. The increase of the population in 70 years in Hackney was, therefore, no less than 102,480, and in Stoke Newington, 8,019. Rather more than 30 per cent. of the increase between 1861 and 1871 arose from excess of births over deaths, as there were 34,328 births registered against 21,825 deaths, giving an increase of 12,503 persons. It is also pretty certain that the excess of births over deaths was larger than the number given here, for although all the deaths are registered, we may be sure that all the births are not. These returns are shown in the Table No. XII. This table also proves that nearly 30,000 immigrants came to reside in this district during the decade of 1861.71. TABLE XII. HACKNEY DISTRICT Registered in the 10 years 1861—1870. Excess of births registered over deaths. Increase of the population. 1861—1870. Marriages Births. Deaths. 1861—1870. 10,280 34.328 21,825 12,503 41,656 This large number of persons are distributed over the district in greatly varying proportions as regards density; indeed, out of the 3,935 acres belonging to the district, no less than 467 consist of open spaces which cannot be built upon, and 101 acres of water. The average number of persons to an acre was 32 for the whole district, including the 568 acres which cannot be built upon. The land and water are distributed as follows:—in Stoke Newington, 589 acres of land and 49 of water; in Stamford Hill, 600 acres of land and 13 of water; in West Hackney, 466 acres of land and only 1 of water; in 24 Hackney, 1760 acres of land and 35 of water; and in South Hackney, 419 acres of land and 3 of water. The average of the open spaces is as follows:—the Marshes, about 345; Well Street Common, 30; Newington Common, West Hackney, 5½; Clapton Common, 9¼ ; Hackney Downs, 50; and London Fields, 27 acres There are, also, several small pieces of waste ground, which need not be set out here. The Census showed that the 124,951 persons lived in 19,347 houses, being at the rate of 645 persons in each 100 houses, and that there were 69,976 females to 54,975 males, or 127 females to each 100 males. In 1851 there were 33,346 females to 25,083 males, or 133 females to 100 males; whilst in 1861 there were 47,337 females to 35,958 males, or 131 females to 100 males. These differences have, doubtless, partly arisen from the smaller number of servants now kept, in proportion to the whole population, as we have now a much larger ratio of small houses than we had in 1851, or even than in 1861. In 1861 there were 13,392 inhabited houses, and in 1871, 19,347; of which, 12,352 in 1861 were in Hackney, and 1,040 in Stoke Newington; and in 1871 there were 17,791 in Hackney, and 1,556 in Stoke Newington. There were also 518 uninhabited houses in 1861, and no less than 1,560 in 1871; whilst there were 370 buildings in 1861 against 307 in 1871. These figures show that in spite of the great increase of population, the number of houses built has been far in excess of the requirements of the district, and it is probable that house property must be in a depressed condition for some years, even if new buildings are almost entirely discontinued. The statistics for each sub.district will be found in the appendix— Table No. 25 In order to ascertain the death rate in other districts for comparison with that of Hackney, I have ascertained the population of all the Superintending Registrars. Districts from the Census of Returns for 1861 and 1871, and calculated the numbers living in each in 1866, so as to compare with the mean number of deaths for the 10 years. I find that Hackney has not only kept its position, but has advanced to the third place in the list, as regards a low death rate, the districts of Hamp. stead and Lewisham (which includes Lewisham, Sydenham and Penge) only being above it; whilst Islington, which in 1851 had a smaller death rate, has now a larger one than Hackney. We might, a priori, have expected, that the death rate for Hampstead and Lewisham districts would have been the smallest in the Metropolis, as, with the exception of Woolwich, they have the smallest number of residents to an acre. As the influence of density of population is often lost sight of, I append calculations for the eight least and the eight most crowded districts in London. I would mention here, that allowance has seen made for deaths in workhouses not belonging to the districts, and also in hospitals. No. of Persons to an Acre Name of District. Death rate per 1000 Residents. No. of Persons to an Acre Name of District.

The list of eight most sparsely inhabited districts includes the five most healthy, and of eight most densely inhabited districts, the five most unhealthy districts in London. I call those districts the most healthy in which the death rate is lowest, and those most unhealthy in which the death rate is highest. It does not follow, that the districts having the highest death rate, are really the most unhealthy to live in, because the excess in mortality may arise from the want of sufficient food, and proper clothing and shelter to keep a large proportion of the inhabitants in good health. If we refer to Table 16 in the appendix, we shall see that there were no less than 22 public institutions in Hackney at the census of 1871. Of these 19 did not belong to Hackney, but one has been removed since then, viz., the London Orphan Asylum, Clapton, in which there were 452 inmates. The total number of inmates was 2923, of which 1271 were of males, and 1652 of females. There were 529 persons in the Hackney Workhouse ; 21 in the Hospital, in Brooksby's Walk; and 35 in the Hospital in the High street, Homerti in. There were also 615 residents in the City of London Union; 294 in the Fever Hospital, Homerton; 179 in the Small-Pox Hospital; 140 in Brook House Lunatic Asylum; 115 in the German Hospital; and 124 in the Northumberland House Lunatic Asylum. The other institutions contained less than 100 in each. The original parish of St. John at Hackney is now divided into thirteen ecclesiastical districts, and St. Mary, Stoke Newington, into two. I have appended a Table, No. 15, which shows the date of formation, the area in acres, the number of inhabited and uninhabited houses, of persons—males and 27 females—in each ecclesiastical district, as I thought it might be useful. During the past year I attended on Mr. Ayrton, with Mr. Ellis and other gentlemen, on several occasions respecting the condition of the bathing lakes, Victoria Park, and with Mr. Charles Reed and several members of the Vestry, respecting improved regulations for bathing. After a good deal of correspondence the lakes have been cleansed, and are no longer injurious to health. I have also had an interview and some correspondence with the Secretary of the Regent's Canal Company as to the cleansing of the canal and basins leading thereto. The medical officers of health for Shoreditch and Bethnal Green joined me in the applications to the Regent's Canal Company, and so afforded material assistance. There was considerable difficulty in getting some of the basins cleansed in our district, and I believe also in Shoreditch; but eventually the whole of the mud was removed. There have been several prosecutions of persons for carrying on trades so as to be a nuisance to the neighbourhood. One—namely, that against Mr. Davy, was mentioned in my last report, so that it need not be referred to at greater length. Another was against the occupier of a fat-melting house, where various kinds of fat were melted by steam, and subsequently purified. At times the smell was very offensive, especially when a large quantity of tinned Australian meat was boiled down for the fat. Proceedings were taken under the unrepealed sections of the Old Building Act, as the premises were within 40 feet of a road, and 50 feet of a house, and the magistrate fined the defendant £5 and costs. Notices were also served 28 under the same Act on a varnish maker, requiring him to discontinue his trade, which he did; also on a butcher, who boiled bones and offal so as to cause offensive effluvia. In both of these cases it was not necessary to take any legal proceedings. My attention having been called on several occasions to quantities of fish which were unfit for the food of man; I directed the inspector to pour carbolic acid over them so as to prevent their being sold, but did not take proceedings, as the owners agreed to this course being adopted. I also had 18 wild boars carbolised in a similar manner, as they were unfit for food, and the owner agreed to my proposal after some discussion. They were not exposed for sale when I saw them, but they had been the day before. We also took proceedings against the London General Omnibus Company, for not providing proper drainage, and a sufficient cover to a large dung pit near Colveston Crescent. Several persons who had suffered from the effluvia attended at the court, and gave evidence against the company. After a long hearing, the magistrate ordered the company to provide a cover sufficiently large to keep the sun from shining and the rain from falling on the dung when in the pit. In this case the magistrate required me to prove that the dung was not only a nuisance to the inhabitants, but that it had produced injury to the health of some persons, which I succeeded in doing. I have also obtained 42 orders from the Board prohibiting persons from keeping pigs in the vicinity of houses. In most cases your order was sufficient; but in a few instances summonses were taken out at the Police Courts. The total number of summonses heard at the Police Courts during the year was 72, the majority being against persons who had neglected to repair and 29 wash, or properly drain houses which were so dirty or dilapidated or badly drained as to be a nuisance. I also inspected, with the Committee, 92 cow-sheds and 85 slaughter-houses, and attended at the Sessions House, Prescott Street, on two occasions. The magistrates refused to grant licenses for one of the cow-sheds and five of the slaughter-houses, the grounds of the refusal being that the cow-shed was in a small yard adjoining a very large school; and that the butchers refused to remove their horses from the slaughter-houses, preferring to use them as stables rather than for slaughtering. Many of these premises were inspected on several occasions, as there was much difficulty in getting the necessary work done. For the future greater care will have to be exercised as regards the granting of licenses to private slaughter-houses, if there is any chance of the clause in the Old Building Act, prohibiting their continuance after 1874, being repealed. On the request of the Sanitary Committee I drew up a report of the steps nesessary to be taken if an epidemic of cholera should occur, and append a copy thereof to my report. I was also directed to write to the Committee of the Small-Pox Hospital, Homerton, asking if a portion of the hospital or grounds could be set apart for the reception of cholera patients if required by this Board, but received a reply in the negative. I also wrote to the Committee of the German Hospital, asking a similar question, and received a very courteous reply in the affirmative, so that it would not be necessary to provide a cholera hospital for the district if the disease should reach us at some future time. The superintendence of the removal of dust has led to more satisfactory results than formerly, as there were only 2603 30 requests to remove dust and refuse during the year; and comparatively few of the letters contained complaints of neglect, the majority being simple requests for removal. Many of the complaints arose from the dustmen refusing to remove trade refuse, which they were justified in doing. There were 3734 requests for dust removal in 1871, against 2603 in 1872, and very many more complaints of non-removal or of incivility on the part of the men. The total cost for the year was £2291 16s. 4d., which was a little in excess of the lowest tender at a lump sum. The contract accepted was that of Mr. Iszard's, at 2s. 5d. per load, Mr. Iszard providing cart, horse, baskets, ladder and shovel, and also a man for each cart, who was responsible to the contractor for the cart, horse, and implements. Mr. Iszard was also prohibited from shooting the refuse in this district, except in such places as I sanctioned. The smallest number of carts employed was 11, and the largest, 22; the smallest number of men was 9, and the greatest, 14. As there are now above 19,600 inhabited houses in the district, and 16,192 loads were removed, there was much less than a load per house of ashes and house refuse in the year. On the 4th of June P. H. Holland, Esq., attended here to hold enquiry as to whether or not a further limitation of burials was needed in the Hackney District. At Mr. Holland's request a notice had been previously sent to the Revs. T. O. Groodchild, rector of Hackney, R. D. Tyssen, rector of South Hackney, T. Jackson, rector of Stoke Newington, W. Baird, vicar of Homerton, and Mr. Whitehead, minister of the Unitarian Church, Paradise Place. The Revs. W. Baird and T. Jackson sent letters of apology. The Rev. T. O. Groodchild attended also the sextoness. Mr. Martin stated that as regards the grave yard of St. John at Hackney, there existed considerable doubt n the public mind as to the manner in which the "Orders in 31 Council" were carried out, especially as to the quantity of concrete used, and asked for explanations or information on several points. The Register of Burials was produced, and contained the particulars of 220 interments which had taken place during the year ending March 24th last. After much discussion, it was agreed and consented to by the Rev. T. O. Goodchild, that all persons making application for the burials of friends should sign a declaration that the deceased was a member of a family which had a family grave in the churchyard before June, 1862, and that the same be open for the inspection of Dr. Tripe; likewise, that more concrete should be used around the coffins. As regards old South Hackney church yard, that the same should be closed for all burials except in the private vaults, That the question of interments in the vaults in the Stoke Newington churchyard might stand over until a fresh application was made as to the drainage of Willberforce's vault or other vaults. Mr. Holland, the Sub-Committee, and Dr. Tripe then inspected Homerton churchyard, and ascertained that very few burials took place there, that all interments in the common ground had been discontinued, and that care is taken to carry out the Order in Council. Mr. Holland, therefore, decided not to take any action as regards this grave yard at present. In accordance with instructions received from you, I tested the burners of several street lamps, also Bronner's burners, and an improved fish-tail burner. These burners, by the kind permission of the engineer to the Imperial Gras Company, were all tested at the company's testing room with the following results, viz.:—I found with the street lamp burners that on an average, when the pressure was 5½-tenths of an inch, the consumption was 5 feet per hour, and the illuminating power 32 equal to 1163 candles. That when the pressure was 8-tenths of an inch, the consumption and illuminating power were the same as before; but when it was 12-tenths of an inch (which it always is from dusk up to about 10.30 p.m.) the consumption was 5.8 feet per hour, and the illuminating power of 13 candles. It is, therefore, evident that the Board gets at least the quantity of gas it pays for. I then tested Bronner's burners, the diaphragon or stop of one being broken, I found that with 8-tenths pressure, the one with the damaged stop consumed 5.75 feet per hour, and gave a light equal to 13 candles; with 12-tenths pressure, it consumed 6.70 feet per hour, and gave 15 candles' illumination. The perfect Bronner's burner, with 8-tenths pressure, consumed 4.60 feet per hour, and gave a light equal to 10 candles; but with 12-tenths pressure it consumed 5 feet per hour, and gave a light of 13.5 candles. The fish-tail burner, with 8-tenths pressure, consumed 6 feet per hour, and gave a light of 11.2 candles only; and with 12-tenths pressure it consumed 7.7 feet per hour, and gave a light of 14.8 candles, so that the illuminating power of 10-feet gas, burned in two of Bronner's burners, at 12-tenths pressure, was equal to 27 candles, as against only 19 candles when burned in two of the fish-tail burners. Similar results to these with Bronner's burners were subsequently obtained with Sugg's patent fiatflame burner. There have been 31 cases of over-crowding discovered, which were so bad as to be injurious to health. I say discovered because they were all found out by inspection, and not one from complaint. Amongst these I will mention the following: at No. 3, Sheep Lane, the father, mother, a son of 17, a daughter of 15, a boy of 8 years, and an infant lived and slept in a small room containing only 925 cubic feet of air, and 33 therefore, not large enough for two adults and one child. In Goring Street a man was found living with a widow and her two children in an extremely small room, containing only 562 cubic feet of air. In a small room, having a cubical capacity of 604 feet, were discovered the father, mother, two girls of 12 and 11 years, and also two young children, so that there was only 100 cubic feet of air for each. In No. 16, Duncan Street, there were three families, consisting of eighteen persons, living and sleeping in four small rooms, the largest room containing only 1014 and the smallest 757 cubic feet of air. At 15, Duncan Square, in four rooms—the largest of which had a cubical capacity of 1020 feet, and the smallest 763 feet—there were four families, one of which, consisting of the mother, a son of 21 years, a daughter of 16, and two younger children, lived in a single room. In No. 10, Duncan Square, the father, mother, and six children under 12, inhabited one small room containing 868 cubic feet of air. At No. 11, Sheep Lane, the mother and father slept in one room, and a son of 20 years old, a daughter of 18, another of 16, and a lad of 14, slept in another small room. In Farm Place, Cottage Lane, there were several instances of families residing in rooms with but little more than 100 cubic feet of air for each person. In Shacklewell Row, the father, a son of 21, another of 19, and a grown-up daughter, lived and slept in a room, the cubic contents of which was only 904 feet. In a room having a capaoity of 766 feet, situated in Taylor's Buildings, a man and his wife, two children under 10, and a woman who was not related to either, were found living and sleeping. In a house in Warburton Road, the father, mother, a son of 19, and a daughter of 16, lived and slept in a room holding only 990 feet of air. All these show the necessity for the strict supervision exercised in this district upon the dwellings of the poor, and for regular house-to-house inspection, 34 by which alone cases such as these can be found out, and the overcrowding abated. In two cases it was necessary to take out summonses against the offenders before the overcrowding could be removed; but in all others it was promptly abated. There is one point worth notice, and that is, that nearly all our bad cases of overcrowding occur in the streets and places situated to the south of London Fields, and adjoining to Bethnal Green Parish. As the smallpox epidemic had very much abated by the commencement of this year, and no other disease requiring the free use of disinfectants had broken out, there has not been so large a quantity of disinfectants used, nor so many houses disinfected as in 1871. In the last-named year, there were 110 less than 928 houses disinfected, against 213 in 1872. In 1872 there were 928 articles of bedding and clothing removed to the disinfecting chamber from 87 houses. In the other cases of infectious diseases which came under our notice, the bed, bedding, and clothes, etc., were disinfected in the rooms with sulphur vapours. The cost of wages for removing the articles to the chamber, and of coals and sulphur in disinfecting them, was £36 17s., and the amount received was £10 1s., leaving a balance against the board of £26 16s. This total cost has been so small, in consequence of the men employed working on the roads, when not engaged in the disinfecting operations. The chief Sanitary work performed in accordance with the Sanitary Act, consisted of the examination of the rooms, yards, out-buildings, and cisterns or water-butts of 6126 houses, which were either occupied by two or more families, or by persons belonging to the poorer classes. This number is nearly the same as for last year, when 6124 houses were thus examined. There were 26211 rooms in the 6126 houses (excluding wash- 35 houses), and 8812 families lived therein, against 8974 families in 1872. There were also 45652 persons against 46177 in 1872, so that the houses were not quite so crowded this year. The average number of persons to a house in London, when the Census was taken, was 7.8, which was precisely the same as in 1861, whilst in Hackney it is now 74 per house in the poorer neighbourhoods, and 6.6 for the whole district, showing that the number of persons in each of our poorer houses, as well as in those of the district generally, is less than for all classes of houses in London. The number of houses in which nuisances were discovered, was no less than 2517, showing that about 42 per cent. of the houses inspected were either dirty and dilapidated, so as to require white-washing, cleansing, and repairing, or that the paving in the yards was defective, or the drainage bad; whilst in some cases, the houses were rendered unfit for habitation, by what I may call an aggregation of nuisances. The number of houses which were thus more or less defective in their sanitary arrangements was greater this year than last by nearly 100, showing the necessity for at least an annual imspection of all the small houses in the district. An examination of the last page in this report shows, that out of 6899 houses examined, only 560 were inspected through complaints received; so that out of the 3290 houses which required some works to be done, or disinfection to be performed, so as to render them safely habitable, only the 560 just mentioned, or about one-sixth, were examined from complaints. I again mention these facts somewhat more in detail as proving the necessity for regular sanitary supervision. There were also 151 greengrocers' and 58 fishmongers' and Poulterers' yards inspected—some of them on second occasions; also 120 bakehouses, many of whioh required to be lime-whitened and cleansed, and a few to be repaired. 36 The number of nuisances from defective drainage, was smaller than for the previous year, as the last portion of the district not provided with proper drainage (I refer to High Hill Ferry and other houses, hitherto draining into the River Lea), has had a main sewer made for it, so that very few oesspools remain to be emptied and filled up; there will, probably, be from time to time, a few cesspools discovered, as landlords have occasionally made new drains without emptying and filling up the cesspools, but, with these exceptions, this portion of our work may be considered as completed. The number < >f nuisances from defects in houses was also less, as fewer yards required to be paved, and a smaller number of houses to be white-washed and repaired, but a larger number have received a better supply of water, or better fittings. The number of notices served is still very large, in consequence of the landlords rarely complying with the first, and often not with the second, or even third notioes. The statement at the end of the report shows, that 3462 preliminary notices were served, and that as 1396 owners of property did not attend to the first notices, second notices had to be served; also that third notices had to be served on 766 persons, and 72 summonses were necessary before we could obtain the removal of the nuisances. I may mention, that in no case was a summons taken out tinder the "Nuisances Removal Acts," unless at least two notices had been previously served on the owner or other person permitting or causing the nuisance. I have attended, during the year, 50 meetings of the Sanitary Committee, or of Sub-Committees appointed by them; at the hearings of the proceedings against Mr. Davy, in the Court of Chancery, and also of the 72 summonses taken out at the Clerkenwell and Worship Street Police Courts; and have 37 inspected a very large number of premises on whioh nuisances existed, in the majority of which it was not necessary to take proceedings before the Police Courts. In conclusion, I desire to state my satisfaction with the manner in which all the Inspectors have performed their duties, and carried out my special directions, in cases which have occurred under unusual circumstances. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., May 3rd, 1873. Medical Officer of Health. Received, and ordered to be Printed, JOHN KELDAY, May 9th, 1873. Chairman. TABLE XIII.
