ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health. 1895. CHISWICK : Printed by Platrier and Sons, High Road. 1896. Chiswick Urban District Council. Sanitary Department. THE SEVENTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to submit for your consideration my Annual Report for the year 1895 upon the general sanitary condition of our distriót, together with an account of the steps taken in the administration of the laws for the proteótion and improvement of the public health of the parish, combined with other details pertaining to the Sanitary Department of your service for the past year. The following are briefly some of the main features which characterised the year. The Vital Statistics indicate a continued falling-off in the birth rate, being the lowest during the past ten years. The Death Rate and zymotic death rate continue low, although the former was slightly in excess of that for the year 1894. 4 An outbreak of influenza occurred during the month of January and prevailed during the first four months of the year, resulting in 15 deaths, a large proportion being attributed to diseases of the pulmonary organs. A few cases of scarlet fever were notified during each month of the year, which were of a mild type, and showed a tendency to increase towards the latter part, chiefly in December. A slight outbreak of measles occurred during July ; this complaint was more or less prevalent until the end of the year, causing 11 deaths. The rate of infantile mortality, or the proportion of deaths under one year of age to every thousand births, was 160, which is rather above the average ; for London it was 165, and for thirty-three great towns, 182. This comparatively high rate arises from the faót that the cause lies in the daily personal attention the infant receives, or the want of it, and the nature and charaóter of the food administered, and other domestic circumstances which cannot be controlled by law. Last year, owing to the high Summer and Autumn temperatures, there was an increase of infantile diarrhoea which is usually so fatal at that season, the deaths amounted to 26. Population. The natural increase of population, or the excess of births over deaths, during the year 1895, amounted to 310 ; for the year 1894, it was 395. I have estimated the population for the middle of the year at 24,582. 5 Births. The number of births during the year was 692 (311 males, 381 females); the birth rate was 28T5 against 29.52 for 1894. The birth rate for London was 30.5; and for the thirty-three great towns, 31.3 per thousand. Deaths. During the year 382 deaths were registered (190 males, 192 females), including four non-residents not included in the death rate. The annual rate of mortality amounted to 15.37 per thousand, against 13.05 for 1894. For London it was 19.8; and for the thirty-three great towns it was 20.7. An account of the deaths, tabulated in the usual forms required by the Local Government Board, will be found at the end of this report. Diseases of the respiratory organs (exclusive of phthisis) were responsible for 64 deaths; an increase of eight on the year 1894. Tubercular Diseases. These are among the most important with which sanitarians have to deal, the extent to which they prevail in a district being regarded as the test of the healthiness, or otherwise, of the population. They are too frequently hereditary, but are at the same time susceptible of considerable amelioration, under 6 proved sanitary arrangements, such as pure air and sunlight, efficient drainage and a dry subsoil, good food, warm clothing, and temperance, are powerful antidotes to the bane of tubercle, which is induced by squalor and dirt, by exposure to cold, by intemperance, by the want of the proper necessaries of life, by overcrowding in ill constructed, unventilated houses. The diseases classified as tubercular include tabes mesenterica, tubercular meningitis, and other forms of tuberculosis, such as scrofula, &c. It is probable that the deaths ascribed to tubercular diseases do not comprise all the deaths originating in the tubercular diathesis, and in fact many deaths of children classified as atrophy, premature birth, debility and convulsions were really due primarily to the scrofulous taint. There were 19 sudden deaths necessitating Coroner's Inquests, of which seven were due to syncope and heart disease, six to accidental suffocation, one to convulsions, one to an accidental kick, one to a fall, one run over by a passing train, and two were suicidal. The following table epitomises the ages at which the deaths occurred : Deaths under I year 111 151 under 5 years of age. ,, from 1 year and under 5 years 40 ,, ,, 5 years and under 15 ,, 12 231 over 5 years of age. ,, ,, 15,, ,, 25,, 14 ,, ,, 25,, ,, 65,, 126 ,, ,, 65 and upwards 79 382 Seven of the deaths occurred between the ages of 80 and 90. 7 The following are the diseases which proved most fatal to infants and young children: Diseases of the Respiratory Organs, viz.: Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Pleurisy 17 Measles 11 Whooping Cough 1 Convulsions 27 Diarrhoea 26 Tuberculosis and Marasmus 25 Premature Birth 11 Tubercular Meningitis 4 Total 122 Zymotic Diseases. The following are the deaths from the principal zymotic diseases : Whooping Cough 1 Scarlet Fever 3 Diphtheria 5 Membranous Croup 1 Continued Fever 3 Measles 11 Diarrhoea 26 5o The zymotic death rate was 24 per thousand, against T66 for 1894. For London it was 26, and for the thirty.three great towns, 2.8.

Under the above Act I have received 118 certificates, viz.:— Scarlet Fever 50 Diphtheria 17 Membranous Croup 2 Enteric Fever 9 Continued Fever 16 Erysipelas 23 Cholera (English) 1 118 Those for the year 1894, numbered 132 ; and for 1893, they amounted to 239; showing a steady decrease on previous years. Scarlet Fever was more prevalent than during 1894, and in the month of December the cases increased considerably, almost assuming an epidemic; a few cases were reported during each month, resulting in three deaths. Diphtheria. Seventeen cases were notified (one less than the year 1894), followed by five deaths: one in March, one in August, one in October, and two in December. Membranous Croup and Laryngitis. Two notifications were received, and one death occurred in April. Enteric or Typhoid Fever. Nine cases were reported, but no death. Continued Fever. Sixteen notifications, with three deaths. 10 Erysipelas. There were twenty-three notifications and no death. Cholera (English). This was reported to me as a case of cholera in June, on receiving the notification I at once visited the patient, and found the house in a very dirty and neglected condition, occupied by two families. I gave instructions for the excretions to be thoroughly disinfected, also the rooms used by the patient, who made a satisfactory recovery. Diarrhoea was the immediate cause of twenty-six deaths, against nine for the year 1894 (an increase of seventeen); the cause of this excess I have already referred to in this report. Phthisis. Thirty-nine deaths were registered from this disease, against twenty-seven for the previous year, and twenty-six for the year 1893. This complaint is induced by dampness of the subsoil, overcrowding, &c. Cancer was the cause of fifteen deaths, which is an increase of ten on the previous year, and an increase of seven on the year 1893. This malignant disease is considered by many to be on the increase generally. Possibly however some portion of the apparent increase in deaths assigned to this cause may be due to a more accurate diagnosis. Deaths from cancer are usually more numerous in proportion to population, and is quite as prevalent, probably even more preva 11 lent, amongst well-to-do people than with the poorer classes. The parts of the body most commonly affected are the viscera or internal organs; it is a disease for the most part of later life. I may mention that deaths attributed to cancer are all irrespective of the question whether any other disease was named in the medical certificate. Isolation Hospital. The absence of a Hospital for the reception of cases of an infectious character is, I can only repeat as in all my Annual Reports, much needed in a large and increasing neighbourhood such as this ; I have however reason to hope that an institution of this kind will in the near future be provided. Great progress has been made in London and many large towns and parishes for making this very necessary provision. With regard to the important question of disinfection, I can only repeat that we are placed somewhat at a disadvantage in not being provided with a steam disinfector, this however will be a necessary accessory to the Hospital. Water Supply. I observe with pleasure that your Council have taken steps to secure a constant supply for the whole District, and that the various owners have been required to make the necessary alterations to the fittings for that purpose. A more liberal supply of water is a great point gained, and I believe that your Surveyor has insisted upon draw-off taps being fixed in all new houses. 12 The frost of January and February, commencing on the 30th December, 1894, and terminating on the 5th of March, will long be remembered for its effect on the water pipes generally, both in London and the suburbs, householders in many instances being without water for a period extending over nine weeks. The effect of the intense cold on the public health was very marked, especially in young children and old people. The number of deaths in London, due to diseases of the respiratory organs, rapidly increased: from the 2nd of February to 2nd of March, the weekly return was 945 above the average, and from a comparison of previous records it was found that the frost was more severe than any since 1814. General Inspection of the District. Personally I made inspections and reported on the same to your Council, viz.: Insanitary dwellings, Slaughter houses, Bakehouses, Dairies, and Cowsheds. On reference to the report of the Sanitary Inspector, which is annexed to this, you will observe by the number of visits and notices served for the abatement of nuisances, a clear indication of the careful attention given to the house to house inspection of the Parish, which is an essential part of all sanitary departments. The fact that 311 new drains have been laid where the old system was found defective, adds materially to the sanitary improvement of the District. During the month ofAprilahousetohouseinspectionwasmade of Annandale Road, and out of 42 houses examined 37 drains were found to be defective, requiring to be relaid. A similar inspection was made of Linden Gardens, when the drains were found in the same 13 condition, and all modern improvements have been adopted. Grove Cottages, Strand-on-the-Green, have been re-drained and new water closets provided in accordance with your byelaws. I brought before your notice two old houses in the Back Lane, Strand-on-the-Green, which were in a very dirty and dilapidated condition, without any supply of water, which could only be obtained by crossing the road. These houses are now undergoing repair. I also reported a house in Hogarth Lane, Chiswick, which I found to be not only dilapidated, but the structural defects were of such a serious character as to render the house almost uninhabitable. During the month of October, in accordance with the request of your Council, I made a house to house inspection of Essex Place, Turnham Green, and presented a special report. Many of these houses are very old, and not constructed to meet the requirements of modern sanitation : there were however only two which I condemned as unfit for human habitation, the others, although requiring to be repaired and cleansed, did not warrant demolition. The ordinary notices were duly served on the several landlords to repair and cleanse these houses, which has since been done. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The proceedings under this Act applied to nine houses during the year. 31 and 33, Essex Place, roofs of both dilapidated, 14 guttering defective, also water closets defective, yards requiring paving, back additions unsafe. These cottages have been the subject of judicial proceedings. A block of old houses, known as Blenheim Steps, which were damp owing to defective guttering and low situation, and very dirty due to the uncleanly habits of the occupiers. These houses have since been repaired and cleaned. Also the two houses in Back Lane, Strand-onthe-Green, to which I have already alluded. Smoke Nuisances. During the early part of the year complaints were made to our Sanitary Department by the inhabitants of this and the adjoining parish of Hammersmith, of a nusiance caused by dense volumes of smoke emitted from a chimney in connection with some dye-works. I at once communicated with the proprietor, who took immediate steps to obviate the nuisance. Refuse Removal. The work of emptying ashpits has been carried out more satisfactorily during the past year, the contractor having adhered more strictly to the terms of his contract. A refuse destructor which is in contemplation by your Council to consume the large quantity of dust refuse has for some time been advocated by me. Factory and Workshop Act. A register for outworkers in connection with various trades is kept in my department, and the necessary supervision given by the Sanitary Inspector. 15 Laundries. In the month of February our Sanitary Inspector submitted a report on the sanitary condition of houses where laundry work was carried on; the importance of periodical inspection was obvious. I have instructed the Inspector to keep a list of these premises, and visit them regularly, and insist on proper precautions being taken to prevent the spread of disease of an infectious character. Laundry work is too frequently carried on in premises totally unsuited for the business, in ill ventilated rooms, with insanitary surroundings, which are naturally detrimental to the health of those employed. "The Factory Act, 1894," includes laundries together with the restriction on the hours of labour. The number of laundries included in this report was 41, employing 305 hands. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. The above Act has been duly enforced during the year, and has had the effect of raising the quality of the food sold in the District. Forty-nine samples (thirty-two of milk and seventeen of butter) were submitted for analysis, the total adulteration was nine samples of butter and two of milk; the fines and costs amounting to £37 : 5 : 0. The Condition of the District at the end of the year. The conditions generally in December were satisfactory, with the exception of the continuation of cases of scarlet fever, which indicated a marked increase at this time, otherwise zymotic disease was almost absent from the District, and mortality rate was low. I append the returns of the Sanitary Inspector, and remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FREDC C. DODSWORTH, Medical Officer of Health. 16 Sanitary Inspector's Office, Vestry Hall, Chiswick.
