The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Metropolitan Borough of Southwark. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report of the Health Department for the year 1953. The Registrar General's estimate of the people in midyear 1953 at 96,870 was 1,100 persons less than his estimate for mid-year 1952. This is the first time a decrease has occurred in the population since the war. The Infant Mortality rate has again risen, due largely to the great increase of illegitimate deaths. The general death rate, however, was lower than in the previous year. Infectious diseases provided no difficult problems. Eight cases of Poliomyelitis were notified, but one of these proved not to be a case; of the seven true cases six were of the paralytic type. The mode of spread of this disease is still problematical, but one hopes that ere long this will be discovered. Already there are signs that methods of prevention are not far distant, but it will be some little time yet before wholesale immunisation, as with diphtheria, will be a possibility. Altogether the health of the Borough was satisfactory. Atmospheric pollution is a matter of concern not only to the Health Department but also to the Council. The members of the Health Committee take a lively interest in this important matter, and the responsible officers are "on their toes" and keenly active. The tempo in the Housing activities of the department is rapidly increasing, as is well displayed by the work undertaken during the year and itemised under the Housing Section of this report. I believe that the three essentials for sound national health are good clean food to eat and drink, clean air to breathe, and a separate and distinct house or dwelling with modern ii amenities for each and every family. In my own opinion until these essentials are attained the 'Positive Health' of which we spoke so glibly when discussing our National Health Services will not mature. Almost daily I receive medical certificates from doctors in general practice and hospitals concerning patients suffering from "acute anxiety states," "acute neurosis," etc., due to unsatisfactory or bad housing conditions. On investigation it is found that many of our citizens have perforce to accept accommodation—one cannot call them homes—of two or three rooms with two or three other families occupying other rooms of the same house which formerly was for single occupation. In other cases one finds a young married couple occupying a room in the house of in-laws. Without going into detail it must be quite obvious how such conditions lead to family and neighbourly strife and quarrels, and the terrible mental effects it produces on those who have to endure them, to say nothing of the frustration caused to children who are not allowed to play because of the "people underneath." Such conditions are not peculiar to this Borough; they prevail in most large towns and cities. Is there any wonder that our doctors' surgeries and hospitals are filled daily with wretched people suffering from various forms of nervous complaints and conditions which follow in the wake of mental disturbances of this kind ? These conditions are preventable, but not bv pills and potions—hence the concern of this Council and the Government to build more houses as quickly as possible, and to modernise those older houses which are suitable for this purpose. The remedy is somewhat slow, difficult and costly, but when this objective is attained it will pay high dividends, in happiness, contentment and health, and all that follows as a consequence of this well-being. The problem of the "Old People" is a growing one. The census figures of 1951 show that in the Borough there are 10,396 persons of 65 years and over made up of 6,171 females and 4,225 males. This is about 1,000 less than at the time of the 1931 census, but in those days the population was almost double that of today. Relatively, therefore, there is a much larger proportion of people of 65 plus today. I am happy to report that the work of the voluntary Old People's Welfare Committee is progressing very satisfactorilv and the services rendered are increasing thanks to the aid given by way of grants from the Borough Council and London County Council. Food inspection in the shops, markets and wharves receives particular attention of your officers. It is satisfactory to note that during this year it was possible to inspect a larger quantity iii of imported foods, and that less had to be condemned as unfit for human consumption than had been the case in the past few years. The condemnation figure has shown a steady decline over the past three years. It has been customary in the past—since 1901—to include in the annual report the local census tables when published by the Registrar General. Accordingly this year I have included some of these tables together with similar ones from the 1931 census for comparative purposes. The most striking figures of course are those showing the heavy fall of the population and the consequent diminution of the overcrowding in the Borough. A new table giving the sanitary arrangements of private households is an interesting one in the fact that it shows quite a number of householders who state that they do not possess a piped water supply or even a water-closet, nor do they share these amenities with another household. We in the Health Department know of no house in this Borough without a piped water supply and at least one watercloset; nor have we ever received complaints of such conditions. Once more I wish to thank the members of the Council for their consideration and understanding, the staff of the Public Health Department, and the Chief Officers and staffs of other Departments for their loyal co-operation. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, W. STOTT, Medical Officer of Health. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (As at December 31st, 1953). Chairman—J. J. Sheen. Aldermen: A. E. Barnes, Rev. H.

The birth rate continued to fall for the sixth successive year; the death-rate also fell after increases for two years. The still-birth rate rose, and the infant death rate was the highest since 1949, the illegitimate rate being abnormally high.

There were, however, increases in the notification of cases of dysentery, measles and whooping cough but there were no deaths from these diseases. Dysentery was troublesome in the fact that it caused a large number of cases amongst school children, about a third in all; and in many instances the children infected other children and people in their own homes. There is no doubt that dysentery is a disease which could be eradicated by careful personal hygiene, and some measures should be taken in the schools to see that children—particularly the Infants' Department—attend to personal hygiene after visiting the lavatories. In the home, mothers should pay particular attention to hand washing after attending a child suffering from diarrhœa, and before undertaking the preparation of food. Apart from these remarks there is little requiring any comment regarding infectious diseases. IMMUNISATION Whilst there was a substantial decrease in Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation during 1952, particularly for children over five, "booster" injections were considerably higher. Immunisation completed Whooping Cough Diphtheria Confirmed diagnoses of previously Immunised cases Diphtheria Under 5 years of age 227 1,223 — Over 5 years of age — 6 — Booster injections — 840 — Total 227 2,069 — Total 2,269 Total — PUERPERAL PYREXIA There was again an increase in these notifications. Of the 46 cases, 29 were not Southwark residents; 43 developed the infection in hospitals subsequent to admission for confinement; the remaining three cases were in home confinements. 19 CANCER OF LUNG AND BRONCHUS Deaths From.

PUBLIC HEALTH (INFECTIOUS DISEASES) REGULATIONS, 1953 These regulations came into operation on April 1st, and superseded the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations, 1927, and the Infectious Diseases (London) Regulations 1927. In general substance the new regulations are similar to the old in the notification of diseases and the preventive steps to be taken but they have been framed in accordance with the present working of the health services, and in some important respects concerning the prevention of food poisoning. These provisions now apply to "typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever or other salmonella infections" (previously described as enteric fever) "dysentery and staphylococcal infection likely to cause food poisoning." The new regulations now provide for action to be taken not only as regards a patient but also a person shown to be a carrier of the disease; and either may now be prevented not only from continuing to work in an occupation connected with food or drink, but also from entering such an occupation. Under the 1927 regulations, the prescribed steps could not be taken until the Medical Officer of Health had reported the case concerned to the local authority. In the new regulations there is provision to enable a local authority to give its Medical Officer of Health authorisation to take the prescribed action in cases of urgency before reporting it. 20 INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUMMARY OF NOTIFICATIONS, AGE GROUPS OF CONFIRMED CASKS, AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS.

The deaths from Tuberculosis were only fifty per cent, of the 1952 figure.

This increase may be due to greater co-operation now shown by Hostel and Lodging House keepers in refusing re-admittance to verminous persons until they produce evidence of having attended the Bathing Station for treatment. A reduction is shown in the numbers of School children requiring treatment—mainly for verminous heads. Some of this reduction may be attributed to the fact that, early in the year, the homes of persistently verminous children were visited. The object of these home visits was to encourage mothers to make appointments to attend the Treatment Centre with all their children as a family unit. With a few exceptions, most mothers were co-operative, and 58 families did in fact attend. No child of 25 of these families has, as far as can be known, since required treatment. Two heavy insect infestations have been dealt with during the year. In one instance, "German" cockroaches (Blattella germanica), breeding in a large stack of waste paper, infested a terrace of houses, the small yards of which adjoined the premises where the paper was stored. The other heavy infestation, one of "Book Lice" (Psocids) occurred in a stock of sugar-beet seeds stored in a warehouse. The infestation spread to the adjoining premises, a block of tenements. Whilst there were fewer verminous and infected premises sprayed, there was a very heavy increase in the quantity of verminous and infected articles treated. Sixteen demonstrations of the work carried out at and from the station were given to a total of 143 students—mostly trainee nurses, health visitors and some medical students.

Approximately 150 more intimation notices were issued, and over 600 more complied with, 200 fewer statutory notices were served than in 1952, but 300 more were complied with.

COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are four women's and two men's common lodging houses in the Borough, which are fully occupied nightly. Forty-three inspections of these premises were made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year, 13 of men's lodging houses, and 30 of women's. Seven intimation notices were served of which 6 have been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES There are five premises engaged in offensive trades in the Borough as follows:—Skin Dressers 3, Tripe Dresser 1, Manure Manufacturer 1. During 1953, 45 inspections were made. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 Sixteen applications were received during the year for registration under the Act, all of which were satisfactory. 254 Inspections were made during the year. WATER SUPPLY The domestic water supply of the Borough is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. During the year, one complaint was received regarding the taste of water. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and a sample analysed, which was satisfactory. 27 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 95 Certificates have been issued in respect of the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water at 202 new dwellings as follows :— Michael Faraday House, Faraday Street 36 flats. Trundle House, Lant Street, 1-9 9 ,, School House, Lant Street 1 ,, Brookwood House, Lancaster Street, 1-24 24 ,, Faraday House, Faraday Street, Blocks E & F 37-76 40 ,, Bittern House, Great Suffolk Street, 1-16 16 ,, Comus Place, 10-21 12 ,, Amigo House, Morley Street, 1-30 30 ,, Aylesbury Road, 39-41 (alternately) 2 ,, Kennington Park Road, 67a, 67b, 69a, 69b, 69c, 69d, 71, 73a, 73b, 73d, 73c 11 ,, Wooler Street, 2-40 (alternately) 20 ,, School-Keepers House, West Square 1 ,, 202 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 42 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board. OUTWORKERS One hundred and sixty-seven visits to homes of outworkers were made during the year. The conditions generally were found to be quite satisfactory. There were no cases of default in sending lists of outworkers to the Council, nor was it necessary to serve any notices or institute any prosecutions for work carried on in unwholesome premises (Sec. 111). Nature of work No. of outworkers in August list required by Section 110 (1) (c) Wearing Apparel , Making, etc. J Cleaning and washing 26 Artificial flowers 1 Racquets and tennis balls 4 The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or partially of paper 58 Brush making 1 Carding, etc., of buttons, etc. 9 Total 99 28 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 (The following table is for the 15 months to March, 31st 1954).

HYGIENE IN BARBERS' SHOPS: PROPOSED BY-LAWS The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee have requested the London County Council, after considering the suggestions made by this Council, to include in their next General Powers Bill appropriate provision to enable Metropolitan Borough Councils and the Corporation of London to register hairdressers and barbers, and their premises, and to make by-laws for the purpose of securing hygienic conditions. Representatives of the Bermondsey and District Branch of the National Hairdressers Federation have expressed agreement with the views of the Council, and look forward to the adoption of by-laws. VENTILATION OF SEWERS In March 1952, a Working Party of officers of the London County Council and the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was set up to suggest means for improving the ventilation of sewers and to report what additional Parliamentary powers would be desirable to regulate the discharge of trade effluents into the London sewers. Provisions with regard to the discharge of trade effluents into the sewers have been included in the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1953. The Working Party are of opinion that the provision of a large number of small means of ventilation may be preferable to large ventilating shafts and at the request of the Standing Joint Committee the Council agreed to co-operate in an experiment whereby stoppers on intercepting traps at the drains of properties owned by Metropolitan Councils should be removed for a trial period and the results studied. The officers of the London County Council have been authorised to take the necessary measures so far as London County Council properties are concerned. 30 FACTORIES Five hundred and seventy inspections of Factories were made during the year, and 57 notices were served. There are now 1,043 factories of all types on the register, comprising '233 factories without mechanical power, and 775 factories with mechanical power.

Officers of the local authority are empowered to enter premises for the purpose of inspecting and testing such appliances, offered for sale or letting, as are required to be fitted with guards. CONTROL OF PLEASURE FAIRS The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee considered a letter dated 18th November in which the London County Council referred to the power given in Section 68 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1939 for sanitary authorities to make by-laws for regulating pleasure fairs and drawing attention to the fact that licensable entertainment, e.g. boxing, does, however, sometimes take place at a pleasure fair and the manager of the fair and the promoter of the entertainment may think that having complied with the by-laws they have taken all necessary action. The County Council thought it desirable that some step should be taken to bring to the notice of managers and other persons concerned the fact that compliance with the by-laws does not obviate the necessity for obtaining an entertainments licence, and that a note to that effect, preferably immediately after the by-laws relating to safety, or alternatively, added to the end of the byelaws would meet the point. The Council agreed to act in accordance with this request. EMERGENCY WATER TANKS CLEANSING After discussion between the officers of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee and the London County Council arrangements have been agreed with regard to the cleansing of emergency water taks. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1952—SECTION 26. In July legal proceedings were taken against a person who gave a boy a toy in exchange for a bundle of rags. Defendant pleaded guilty and was fined £1. 32 PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936—SECTION 126 The June investigations were made into the family conditions of persistently verminous school children to discover the possible foci of re- infestation and to advise mothers accordingly. Access was obtained to 77 of the 87 families concerned—11 of these were found to be clean homes where previous treatment and advice had evidently been beneficial, but of the remaining 66, four mothers expressed resentment and refused to consider attending the Treatment Centre and the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee was requested to make representation to the Minister of Health that, subject to adequate safeguards, Medical Officers of Health should be given powers similar to those in the Scabies Order 1941, to compel suspected persons to be examined where necessary.

Whilst the figures of deposited matter in the vicinity of the Bankside area were again very high, there was a general improvement during the latter months of the year compared with previous years. No doubt this reduction in deposits was due to restricted use being made of the old Bankside Generating Station following upon representations and complaints made by the Council to the British Electricity Authority. During the year, practically every boiler house in the Borough has been visited by the Inspector to get firms and persons concerned smoke-conscious. They now know of the harmful effects of smoke and that it is a waste of fuel, and that we can offer them practical advice and suggestions to prevent smoke nuisance. It is our experience that the great majority of firms and operatives are willing to co-operate. The figures obtained from the Council's measuring instruments have proved of value in these visits. The Council submitted to the National Smoke Abatement Society a list of proposals for inclusion in their memorandum to the Government Committee of Inquiry on Air Pollution. A permanent Health Exhibition is being arranged by the Public Health Department and it is the intention to include a section on atmospheric pollution. The figures of the deposited matter as recorded on the sites in Walworth Road and Bankside are as follows:— 1953. Walworth Road Bankside. January 22.3 154.3 tons per sq. mile. February 30.9 268.7 „ „ „ „ March . not available not available April 18.4 43.6 tons per sq. mile.

All these samples complied with the requirements of the Regulations. Nine premises are registered for the use of filling materials, and one licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. WELL WATER There are three private wells in the Borough from which water is used for industrial purposes. The supply in each case is satisfactory.

Most of the dealers sold only prepacked ice-cream, obtained from the large manufacturers. 37 During the year 46 samples of ice-cream were taken with the following results :— 23 samples, Grade I. 11 samples, Grade II. 9 samples, Grade III. 3 samples, Grade IV, In addition : 24 samples were chemically examined for compliance with the prescribed standards of composition of ice-cream. Five of these samples did not contain the requisite amount of fat and the vendors were cautioned. Samples subsequently taken at the premises were satisfactory. Periodical visits were made to all premises. A "Code of Standards" was sent to each new dealer and inspections were carried out before the registration of any new premises to ensure that they were satisfactory and all requirements fully understood. Copies of the Public Analyst's reports on samples taken were forwarded to the vendors concerned. In the case of Grade III and IV samples, special investigations were made at the premises in an effort to detect some fault which may have caused the unsatisfactory gradings. FOOD STANDARDS ICE CREAM ORDER 1953 This Order restored as form the 1st June, 1953, the standard for ice cream which was in force before the 7th July, 1952, viz. :- Five per cent. fat, 10 per cent. sugar and 7½ per cent. solids other than milk. Special provisions are made for ice cream contained in fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree and for "Parov" (Kosher) ice. DESIGNATED MILK During the year the following Licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949. 1 Pasteuriser's Licence. 126 Dealers' Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 163 Dealers' Licences for Sterilised Milk. 93 Dealers' Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. 38 Supplementary Licences. 12 Supplementary Licences for Pasteurised Milk. 11 Supplementary Licences for Sterilised Milk. 12 Supplementary Licences for Tuberculin Tested Milk. Forty-eight samples of Designated Milks were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. All these satisfied the prescribed tests. Forty samples of Pasteurised Milk supplied to local schools were also examined by the Public Analyst, and the London County Council informed of the results. MILK SELLERS At the close of the year there were 164 registered milk distributors in the Borough, whilst the number of distributors purveying milk in the Borough from registered premises elsewhere was 21. 348 Inspections of Milkshops and Dairies were made during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS Eight samples of condensed milk were purchased for analysis under the above regulations. They were all certified by the Public Analyst to comply with the said regulations. The Public Health (Condensed Milk) (Amendment) Regulations, 1953, came into operation on November 11th, and permitted for a limited period the sale of full cream unsweetened condensed milk imported by the Minister of Food, containing not less than 7.8 per cent. milk fat and not less than 25.5 per cent. of all milk solids including fat. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS, 1953 These amendment regulations, made jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Food, have two principal objects as follows:— (a) To permit the use of the special designation "sterilised" in relation to milk which has been sterilised not only in bottles as previously, but also in cans or other approved containers. The use of the special designation in relation to such milk will permit it to be sold by retail or to caterers in areas specified under section 23 of the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. The export trade and sales to ships' stores will also benefit. 39 (6) To appoint 1st October, 1954, as the date from which it shall be compulsory to use caps or covers overlapping the lips of containers of pasteurised milk. This gives ample notice to milk distributors generally, and in particular to pasteurisers, who under the Second Schedule, Part I, paragraph 7, sub-paragraph (2) of the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, will be required from the same date to put milk which is pasteurised into the containers in which it is delivered to the consumer at the premises at which it is pasteurised. THE CREAM AND USE OF MILK (REVOCATION) ORDER 1953 This Order which came into operation on the 1st April, 1953, revokes the Cream Order, 1951, as amended, thereby removing control over the manufacture and sale of cream. It also revokes the Use of Milk (Restriction) Order 1945, and the Use of Milk (Suspension of Restriction) Order 1951, thereby removing the prohibition on the use of milk in the manufacture of biscuits, bread, buns, pastries, cakes, rolls, scones and other similar products, ice-cream, sweetmeats (including sugar, confectionery and chocolate) and synthetic cream. MILK AND DAIRIES (AMENDMENT) REGULATIONS 1953 These Regulations, by amendment of the definition of "distributor," have the effect of excluding from the registration provisions of regulation 8 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, persons who sell cream in the hermetically sealed containers in which it was delivered to the premises and who are not otherwise distributors of milk. BAKEHOUSES At the end of the year there were 29 Bakehouses in use in Southwark, of which 7 were underground. During the year a Basement Bakehouse at 168, Borough High Street was closed by the occupiers. 118 visits were made by the Inspector. STANDARDS FOR SOFT DRINKS The Soft Drinks Order, 1947, was revoked on December 19th, 1953, from which time manufacturers and packers of soft drinks no longer needed licences from the Ministry of Food. 40 The minimum standards for soft drinks prescribed in this Order were continued with minor modifications in a new Order, the Food Standards (Soft Drinks) Order, 1953, which came into force on December 20th. This is intended as a temporary measure pending consideration by the Food Standards Committee of the future scope and level of these standards. ARTIFICIAL SWEETNESS IN FOOD ORDER, 1953 This Order came into operation on the 1st September, 1953, and prohibits the use in food of all artificial sweetening substances except saccharin. The Medical Research Council on the recommendation of the Food Adulterants Committee informed the Minister of Food that on the present evidence they regarded the use of certain artificial sweetening substances as ingredients in food as undesirable on health grounds. FOOD STANDARDS (SACCHARIN TABLETS) ORDER, 1953 This Order came into operation on the 1st September, 1953. It revised the standard for saccharin tablets prescribed in the Saccharin Order, 1949. FOOD STANDARDS (PRESERVES) ORDER, 1953 This Order, which should be read with the Food standards (General Provisions) Order, 1944, as amended, replaces the Food Standards (Preserves) Order, 1944, as amended, and prescribes revised standards for jam and marmalade including ginger marmalade. The standards for fruit curd and mincemeat remain unchanged. The standards prescribed apply as respects both imported and home produced articles and come into operation by stages. PUBLIC HEALTH (PRESERVATIVES, ETC. IN FOOD) (AMENDMENT NO. 2) REGULATIONS, 1953 These amending regulations which came into operation on December 16th and re-enacted the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) (Amendment) Regulations, 1953 with the inclusion, as required by law, of an expression of the Ministers' opinion that certain provisions are necessary for preventing danger to health or otherwise for protecting purchasers, provide for the sale and importation of certain specified dehydrated vegetables which contain sulphur dioxide within prescribed 41 limits, increase the maximum permitted sulphur dioxide content of jam, permit the presence of diphenyl in citrus fruit imported in wrappers treated with diphenyl and for a limited period, the addition of borax to margarine. THE LABELLING OF FOOD ORDER, 1953 This Order substantially re-enacts in a consolidated and revised form the Labelling of Food Order, 1950, and its amending Order. It came into operation on the 5th April 1953 and certain new provisions have been introduced. HOME CANNED FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ORDER 1950 The above Order has been revoked by the Canning of Food and Feeding Stuffs and Home Canned Fruit and Vegetables (Revocation) Order 1953 which came into operation on 16th January, 1953. The Ministry of Food has decided not to make a Food Standards Order under Regulation 2 of the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations 1943, for the continuation of the standards of composition for canned fruit and canned vegetables formerly prescribed by the above Order. The revocation of the Order invalidates the exemption from the need to declare ingredients on labels given in respect of canned fruit and canned vegetables by Table C of the First Schedule to the Labelling of Food Order, 1950, but as it is the intention of the Ministry that traders should have an opportunity of disposing of stocks of home canned fruit and vegetables, bearing labels which do not carry a declaration of ingredients, an amendment is being prepared to continue the exemption. THE FLOUR ORDER 1953 AND THE BREAD ORDER 1953 The general effect of these Orders is to afford some relaxation in the control of flour and bread. The Orders will, except as regards weight, be enforced and administered by the Minister. OFFALS IN MEAT PRODUCTS ORDER, 1953: MEAT PRODUCTS (NO. 3) ORDER, 1952 The Meat Products (No. 3) Order, 1952, was replaced as from 1st March, 1953, by the Canned Corned Meat (Prices) Order, 1953, and the provisions in the earlier Order which prescribed maximum prices and minimum meat content for sausages and sausage meat are not retained. From 1st March, therefore, no control of the minimum meat content of these products has operated. 42 The revocation of the Meat Products (No. 3) Order invalidates the exemption from the need to declare ingredients on labels of pre-packed sausages and sausage meat given by Table C of the First Schedule to the Labelling of Food Order, 1950, but as it is the intention of the Ministry that this exemption should be maintained a suitable amendment to the Order is being prepared. The Minister has decided not to make an Order under Regulation 2 of the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations prescribing a statutory standard of composition for sausages and sausage meat, but has made the Offals in Meat Products Order, 1953 (S. I. 1953, No. 246) which re-enacts (substantially as it appears in the Meat Products (No. 2) Order, 1952) the prohibition against the use of certain specified offals in uncooked open meat products. Prohibited offals are brains, feet, fries, gut (including chitterlings), manifolds, paunches, udders, sweetbreads, tripe, melts or lites, spinal cord, uteri, pigs' maws and calves veils. Infringements of the Offals in Meat Products Order are offences against the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, but by Article 9 of the Order proceedings may be brought by Food and Drugs Authorities in England and Northern Ireland without the consent of the Minister. CONDEMNED MEAT Notification was received in October from the Cuckfield Urban District Council that condemned meat from the Government's slaughterhouse at Cuckfield was being sold to a firm in this borough which previously sold horseflesh for human consumption, but now sold condemned meat from Cuckfield and other Government slaughterhouses. Notices inside the shop stated that the meat was for animals only, and an assistant told the Sanitary Inspector that customers were informed accordingly, but a member of the Public Health Department went to buy some and no statement was made to him. Whilst a number of customers, interviewed after leaving the shop, all said that the meat they had bought was for their animals, one stated that she had been told by other customers that they had bought the meat for their own consumption. Several quarters of beef examined were stained green on the outside, indicating that they had been condemned, and evidence of gross tubercle on the pleura was found. The Public Health Committee felt that the Ministry of Food's method of disposing of unsound meat by public auction was undesirable. Although the first purchaser undertook not to use it for human consumption, no such undertaking was required from subsequent purchasers. 43 It would seem that whether or not this diseased meat was used for human consumption, it would nevertheless be taken into homes and cut up and handled, with a definite risk to public health. The Public Health Committee requested the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to make representations to the Ministry of Food on this matter, and revised conditions of sale have been made. SLAUGHTERHOUSES There is only one licensed slaughterhouse in the Borough, which is not in use. Four inspections of the premises were made during the year to ensure that no slaughtering was in operation. ****** INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON SLAUGHTERHOUSES The Minister of Food has appointed an Inter-departmental Committee to prepare a plan recommending in what localities, subject to a policy of moderate concentration, slaughter-houses (other than in bacon factories) should be sited for the slaughter in England and Wales of cattle, sheep and pigs; recommend an order of priority for new works and major reconstructions; make recommendations on the general principles of siting and the facilities that should be provided in these slaughter-houses; and report on the changes that may be necessary in existing legislation to secure the central regulation of siting and design of slaughter-houses. The Inter-departmental Committee requested the views of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee on the genera] principles which in their opinion should guide them in its recommendations, and in March, I reported that in my opinion, moderate concentration of slaughter-houses was advisable and would lead to efficiency in some respects, particularly in regard to by-products, but transport before and after sluaghter should be kept to a minimum. FOOD AND DRUGS AMENDMENT BILL The Food and Drugs Amendment Bill was introduced in the House of Lords on Tuesday, 10th November, 1953. It amends the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, and the Food and Drugs (Milk, 44 Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. Its main objects are to revise the provisions for protecting the public against the sale of food containing injurious ingredients, and against the mis-description of food and drugs in labels and advertisements, and to provide fuller powers to secure that food is not contaminated in the course of preparation, distribution and sale. FOOD SAMPLING During the year under review, 759 formal samples and 848 informal samples were submitted to the Public Analyst.

CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS There are 477 catering establishments in the Borough. These include riverside snack bars, cafes, coffee stalls, mobile snack bars, public house restaurants, and industrial canteens, all of which have received systematic inspection during the past year. Notices were served and a considerable amount of work has been carried out. As a result, there has been a marked 48 ment in the general condition of premises, and a reasonably high standard is being maintained. Close contact has been kept with the Local Food Office in regard to the proposed new premises and traders, to ensure that all premises comply with Public Health requirements before the issue of food licences.

There is, however, practically no improvement yet in the number of such cases rehoused by local authorities. Considerably fewer overcrowded families were, in fact, rehoused by the London County Council than in the previous year. A survey during the year showed a number of cases that had left the Borough. The final amended total of overcrowded cases remaining at the end of the year was about seventy-five per cent, of the 1952 total. One hundred more cases than in 1952 were recommended to the L.C.C. and the Borough Council for rehousing on medical grounds, but of these only seven more than the previous year were rehoused. 56 641 cases were referred to the London County Council and Borough Council for rehousing on sanitary grounds (as distinct from medical or overcrowding recommendations). During the year 219 cases in this category were rehoused. Both these figures represent a considerable increase over those for 1952, OVERCROWDING 1951 1952 1953 Preniises Families Persons Premises Fami lies Persons Premises Fatnilies Persons New Canes: (End of 1960) (End of 1951) (End of 1952) Remaining on register 568 680 3,298 598 725 3,404 597 732 3,416 New Cases reported and recommended 162 216 881 103 132 583 112 114 597 Total 730 896 4,179 701 857 3,987 709 846 4,013 Overcrowding abated 132 171 775 104 125 571 264 300 1,507 Remaining on register 598 725 3,404 597 732 3,416 445 546 2,506 Overcrowding abated: Rehoused by L.C.C. 66 87 362 78 93 413 47 52 229 Rehoused by Borough Council 13 16 73 13 18 66 12 14 58 Rehoused by other Boroughs - - - - - - - - - Rehoused by owners 2 3 18 19 92 234 1,220 Moved away Found own accommodation 3 6 18 13 205 Cases removed by overcrowding survey 48 59 304 Total 132 171 775 104 125 571 264 300 1,507 1950 1951 1952 1953 Cases investigated on medical, crowding and sanitary grounds 2,156 1,509 1,990 1,569 No. of visits involved 2,587 1,792 2,328 2,062 MEDICAL Recommendations. 1950 1951 1952 1953 CaBeti recommended to L.

Morris, the Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee reports that during the year, nearly 35,000 meals were served from the Gate House Old People's Restaurant, which is open Mondays to Fridays. A luncheon club was also opened in January at Nelson Square, in the north of the borough. The charge to the old people is tenpence for a two-course dinner; tea is one penny. The London County Council pays a subsidy of eightpence on each meal, and the Borough Council made a grant for equipment. 10,515 meals on wheels were supplied by the Gate House Restaurant, a great increase on last year's 2,113. Four vans, two supplied by the Old People's Welfare Committee and two by the Women's Voluntary Services, go out daily from Tuesdays to Fridays, and each patient receives four meals weekly. The charge is tenpence; the London County Council pays a subsidy of tenpence and the Borough Council grant helped to pay for transport and additional equipment. Over 600 chiropody treatments were given during the year at a weekly clinic lent by the London County Council. The Borough Council made a grant for the hire of a car used to bring house-bound patients to the clinic once fortnightly. At the end of May, 60 old people went for an organised holiday to Broadstairs. The charge was £3 12s. for a week and £6 12s. for two weeks. They stayed in boarding houses as private guests and were provided with free entertainment by the local Council. The cost of the holiday was borne entirely by the old people. Several outings were also organised to the seaside and country by coach, and the Rotary Club of Southwark arranged private car outings for house-bound old people. Visits to cinemas and concert parties were also arranged, with Christmas and various other treats. The Gate House Club was open daily from Tuesdays to Fridays. An entertainment was provided every Wednesday and there were also lectures, discussion groups and film shows. 60 During the year, nearly 800 individual cases—twice as many as in the preceding year—were referred to the Organising Secretary by hospitals, doctors, nurses and others. Nearly all these necessitated at least one home visit, and the follow-up work was carried out as far as possible by voluntary visitors. Eighty-two new cases were dealt with by the Public Health Department during the year. A number of aged and infirm persons were regularly conveyed to the treatment and bathing station, bathed and returned home by our transport. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. Compulsory Removals. No cases were dealt with during 1953 under Section 47, and the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which provides for the removal of persons in need of care and attention. Burial of the Dead. During the year the Council arranged for twenty-two burials under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, at a total cost of £190 13s. 6d. MORTUARY.
