Surveyors Annual Report. 29 SURVEYOR'S ANNUAL REPORT, For the Year ending 25th March, 1889. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit my Nineteenth Annual Report our consideration. A further portion of the eastern side of the carriageway, Old ???t Road, between Thomas Street and Page's Walk, has been ???a up, dressed and relaid. About one third of new 4 by 7 ???rnsey Granite Cubes were supplied in the area repaved, in ???e of the cubes unfit to be relaid. The new cubes were laid ???site Page's Walk; also the granite cubes to carriageway both ???s of the Old Kent Road, from the milestone near Bermondsey ??? Road to boundary, Great Dover Street, were taken up, dressed ???relaid. The remaining portion of the road on both sides from ???e's Walk to the boundary near Upper Grange Road, including western side from Darwin Street to Swan Place, requires ???ediate attention, and the work should be put in hand at once. 30 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. The proposed continuation of the remaining part of Mint Street by the Workhouse into Southwark Bridge Road, immediate??? opposite the Central Fire Brigade Station, for which the Vestry application to the late Metropolitan Board of Works to carry the??? same into effect was deferred, might I think now with advantage ??? submitted to the London County Council, the cottages in Mi??? Street and Southwark Bridge Road required for the improvement being in a most dilapidated and insanitary condition. The City and Southwark Subway Company's works are st unfinished. August next is the time stated for completion. The Company have reinstated part of the carriageway and footwa??? Marshalsea Road, and footway, Newington Causeway, disturbed a??? sunken in consequence of their works. With reference to the danger and nuisance to the public cause by the noise from the Borough Road Bridge of the London, Chatha??? and Dover Railway Company's line, although numerous letters ha??? been sent to the Company requesting them to adopt some means prevent the noise, nothing further has been done by the??? than the removal of the corrugated iron ceiling from under ??? bridge, and the decking and corking of the surface of the bridg??? this has the effect of preventing the percolation of water on to the road and footways, but the noise still continues. I have suggested among other methods the adoption of longitudinal sleepers in place of tl cross ones, but the Company's Engineer is of opinion this plan w not be of much service. Other railway bridges of equal span a comparatively noiseless. I would suggest that unless the Company adopt some effectual method without delay to prevent the noise, t??? Vestry proceed against the Company by indictment, as accidents a of daily occurrence. Surveyor's Annual Report. 31 THE UNDERMENTIONED WORKS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED IN THE ROADS DEPARTMENT.
