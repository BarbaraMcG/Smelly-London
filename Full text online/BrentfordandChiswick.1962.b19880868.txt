To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 35th Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick. In 1962 there was a rise in the birth rate combined with a slight fall in the infant mortality rate, but the death rate rose again with sizeable increases in the number of deaths from circulatory disease, and a rise in the deaths from cancer including more deaths from cancer of the lung. Infectious disease notifications were low, and those who did develop a notifiable infection were mild cases with little serious illness and little spread to contacts. Although there was an increase in notifications from tuber culosis, nearly half of these were transfers from other districts and the number of new local cases was lower than in the previous year - but on the other hand there were five deaths from this disease compared with only one in each of the two previous years. In the Report it will be seen that much work was carried out on slum clearance, the extension of smoke free areas., and hygiene of food preparation and of food handlers. A survey of the needs of elderly people receiving meals through the Meals on Wheels Service revealed that, if a welfare officer or other visitor has time to interview elderly persons living alone, a great deal of help can be provided for them, they are often unaware of the services available and although with the enlarging Meals Service the dangers of malnutrition of the elderly are lessened, other matters likely to affect their health and safety, particularly the slow onset of deafness or weaker vision, or the mental deterioration from loneliness and lack of interests can be discovered and remedied The study of the 1961 Census figures gave much food for thought as to the precise amount of improvement in living conditions which had taken place in the Borough over ten years, there was no doubt that a good amount of the lost time, lost from 1936 when the first portents of the European War began to delay projects of overcrowding relief and slum clearance until 1954 when the Housing Repairs and Rents Act authorised local authorities to prepare to clear their worst slums before I960,, had been regained But the evidence was clear, revealed by what amounts to a rough survey of all houses in the year 1961, that overcrowding remains and that much substandard housing exists. Much work was done on the survey and other inspections in connection with the scheme to render Brentford and Chiswick a smoke free borough. -7- My thanks are due to all who so readily responded when asked for information on matters affecting the health and well being of the citizens, also to everyone who has helped in the preparation of this Report, and to all members of the staff of the Department for their good work throughout the year.

The skyline of the long river frontage is altering with the appearance of new skyscraper office blocks but there is a splendid stretch of unspoiled river land along most of the length of the Borough, In the Brentford end, industry is served also by the Grand Union Canal as it reaches its outlet to the Thames, and two great main roads carry traffic east and west while in 1962 to improve traffic conditions in the Borough, the building of a road on stilts was begun, the first major one of this kind in or near London, although the need for these has been evident for many years There are 620 25 acres of open space within the borough with ample facilities for refreshment and recreation both for the public in general and for the sporting activities of particular groups The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25%, a very reasonable proportion for an urban area. In the 1961 Census Report, which recently became available, the density of the population of the Borough is down as 23.5 persons per acre compared with 25,5 persons per acre in 1951 The Census figures also show the effects of slum clearance over the years, i.e. the number of families sharing a common water tap or requiring to go outside for water has decreased from 5,631 in 1951 to 1,033 in 1961, this in spite of the increase in multiple occupation of houses which has been rising during these years; the number of families sharing a fixed bath has dropped from 4,782 to 3,952, but although the number of families who -9- have not the use of a fixed bath is less, i.e. 6,126 in 1951 and 4,087 in 1961, this still means, in terms of persons without the use of a fixed bath, that over 10.000, nearly one-fifth of the Borough population, are so situated, Another undesirable feature is that 118 households are recorded as havingno water closet within the dwelling of the family, but since April, 1961, the time of Census taking, 38 dwellings of this nature, containing 41 households have been demolished and the families rehoused In addition 10 houseboats have been included amongst the Brentford and Chiswick dwellings, and most often these do not possess an indoor water closet. Forty-eight houseboats are known to the staff of the Public Health Department, so which ten have been included in the Census figures is not known. The Census report also shows that in 1961 there were 80 persons over the age of 90 years living in Brentford and Chiswick In the 1951 Census there were 56 aged more than 90 years Old Age Pensioners(i.e males over65, females over 60 years of age) numbered 8 945 (2,521 male, 6,424 female) compared with 8,755 (2.588 male, 6,167 female) in 1951, 1.737 of these lived alone and 5,448 either alone or with one other of pensionable age. The increase in ten years has been very small indeed compared with the National Increase and the figures are of great interest because of the potential requirements for Welfare Services The number of persons enumerated who were not born in the United Kingdom was 4,374 including 970 born in Asiatic countries, 1,958 from Europe and 499 from Caribbean countries The percentage of persons living at a density of more than 1½ persons per room had dropped from 9 .0 in 1951 to 6. 9 in 1961 The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades, artisans, factory workers etc.., and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress continues to be made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. Information on the rehousing of the tenants in council houses and details concerning assessment of slum dwellings, demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report. Overcrowding of dwelling houses still remains a problem in the Borough but the number of cases of statutory overcrowding known to the Public Health Department at the end of the year decreased slightly for the second successive year. More new cases were found during the year, i.e., 20 in 1962 compared with 11 in 1961 The unemployment figures for adult persons i.e. aged 18 and over, in the Borough at the end of 1962 reflect a further decrease in the number of jobs available due to various firms moving out of the Borough to larger premises. At the end of the year there were 329 unemployed altogether, of which 271 were men and 58 women This compares with 200 men and 66 women unemployed at the end of 1961, and 147 men and 34 women unemployed at the end of 1960. On 5th December, 1962, the number of jobs vacant totalled 248, (331 at the same date in 1961 and 423 in 1960) of which 123 were for men and 125 for women. For the first time in some years, therefore, the number of jobs available fell below the number of persons seeking employment -10- The unemployment figures at the end of 1962 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows:- Boys Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.62 19 10 29 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 57 72 129 Totals 76 82 158 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.62 31 81 112 In view of the progressive loss of manufacturing concerns from the area, apprehension was felt at the start of the year about the employment opportunities locally for young people due to leave school in July. The situation was greatly eased, however, by the number of children remaining at school after reaching the statutory school leaving age. The choice of employment was more limited than in previous years, and boys who sought apprenticeships in carpentry, printing and engineering trades were sometimes disappointed. Older boys and girls who wished to change their work, or who were unemployed duringthe second half of the year did not readily find other suitable employment, and there were indications of a falling-off in the demand for young workers in the majority of trades and professions.

The acreage of Carville Hall Park has been reduced by 2. 3 acres and Boston Manor Park by approximately 4 acres because of the encroachment of the ChiswickLangley Road. Additional open spaces are planned as under:- Harvard Hill 2 acres (approx.) Robin Grove 1. 41 acres -11- Other Facilities In the Borough for Open Air Recreation Privately owned open spaces and sports grounds 111.71 acres Council owned open spaces and sports grounds leased to private clubs etc 67.94 " School playing fields 50.50 " Gunnersbury Park 186. 00 " Facilities for recreation provided by the Borough Council or by Middlesex County Council and maintained by the Parks Department of Brentford and Chiswick Council are as follows:- 15 Football Pitches 29 Tennis Courts 8 Rugby Pitches 12 Cricket Pitches 7 Hockey Pitches 10 Children's Playgrounds 2 Bowling Greens 6 Jumping Pits 1 Putting Green 4 Running Tracks (grass) In addition, the Borough Council shares in Gunnersbury Park with Ealing and Acton, forming with them a joint committee known as the Gunnersbury Park Joint Committee, further facilities as follows:- 39 Football Pitches 16 Tennis Courts 2 Rugby Pitches 11 Cricket Pitches 2 Hockey Pitches 1 Children's Playground 2 Bowling Greens 2 Golf Courses 2 Putting Greens 1 Boating Lake 1 Fishing Lake Swimming Baths and Paddling Pools Controlled by the Council Brentford Indoor Swimming Baths Area 2,430 sq. ft Capacity 12,049 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1962 70,350 Average number per day 162 Maximum number using baths on one day 435 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools:- Large Pool Area 7,500 sq.ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft. Snail Pool Area 3,500 sq.ft. Capacity 18,375 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1962 64,024 Average number per day 393 Maximum number using baths on one day 2.339 The variation in figures from year to year is a very clear indication of the type of summer weather Last year was cold, wet and dull and the figures for the indoor bath increased by almost the same number as those for the Open Air Pools fell, the total for the two being nearly the same as in 1961. This is quite interesting since the two places are over two miles apart. -12- The source of the water in the swimming baths is the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board. In both the indoor bath and the outdoor pools the water goes through a continuous filtration process, the rate of change-over being about once every three hours in the indoor bath and about once every ten hours in the open air pools, though this latter rate is speeded up during periods of heavy use of the pools, Topping up to allow for loss by evaporation or removal is done several times weekly Additional purification is carried out by means of intermittent chlorination, the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0, 6 parts per million. Water samples are taken two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation To keep down growth of algae, "Panacide" continued to be used during the year. As an algicide this substance seemed fairly efficient, but it seems to add little to the anti-bacterial effect of the chlorine in the water and it seems to alter the colour to some degree Water sampling was carried out from time to time and in June and July occasional unsatisfactory samples were obtained from the Chiswick Pools, but subsequent sampling gave good results for the rest of the season. Paddling Pools - Duke' s Meadows:- Area (2 pools each 60 'x 60') 7,200 sq.ft. Depth 6" to 1' in middle These paddling pools are emptied and refilled daily from the mains supply and pint of Chloros is added at each filling. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather conditions Public Baths and Washouses Brentford: In Clifden Road, Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men and 7 for women The total number using the baths during 1962 was 16,409 persons. Chiswick In Belmont Road Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women In addition, 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1962 was 40 469 In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section, 30 drying horses, hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1962, 1,162 persons took advantage of the service. 13 VITAL STATISTICS, 1962 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 897 46 2 435 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 18.41 Illegitimate 119 62 57 TOTAL 1,016 524 492 Stillbirths Total Male Female Legitimate 13 10 3 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births - 13.59 Illegitimate 1 1 - TOTAL 14 11 3 Deaths Total Male Female 687 3 28 359 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 12.45 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births - Nil Other Puerperal Causes Deaths of Infants under 1 Year of Age Total Male Female Legitimate 17 12 5 Rate per 1,000 live Births - 20.67 Illegitimate 4 2 2 TOTAL 21 14 7 Deaths and Death Rate There was a rise in the death rate, the figure of 12.45 comparing with one of 11 .09 for the previous year To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar General, In 1962, this factor was 0.96 and so the corrected death rate was 11. 95. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was 11.9, so the figure for Brentford and Chiswick was similar to the average rate for the country as a whole Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation. The principal causes of death were:- 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 Circulatory Disease (including coronary disease) 245 218 215 201 222 215 224 206 Heart Disease Cancer (including 76 73 84 76 99 82 91 96 Leukaemia) 155 134 126 123 130 135 153 139 Cancer was the chief cause of death in 1962. coronary disease gave the next highest figure 134 deaths Deaths from Measles Nil Deaths from Whooping Cough Nil Deaths from Diphtheria Nil Deaths from Puerperal causes Nil Deaths from Tuberculosis 5 Deaths from Poliomyelitis Nil The distribution of cancer deaths in sites is shown below Site of Primary Growth Fema1e Male 1962 1961 1960 1959 1962 1961 1960 1959 Stomach 6 9 5 6 8 7 7 13 Lung, Bronchus 34 26 27 25 7 7 7 1 Breast - - - - 13 15 15 16 Uterus - - - - 6 2 8 6 Intestinal 12 11 7 - 8 10 15 1 Prostate 5 9 - 3 - - - - Bladder 5 - 4 2 1 3 1 2 Brain 1 1 1 2 4 2 - - Other 17 15 10 19 25 17 15 25 Leukaemia 1 - 2 1 2 - 2 1 Totals 81 71 56 58 74 63 70 65 15 The lung cancer deaths have risen again, and in the year 1962 were found to equal the number who died from cancer of the alimentary system These amount ed to 21 males and 20 females, a total of 41, compared with 34 males and 7 females dying of lung cancer, also a total of 41.

Comparative figures from deaths from violent causes over the last 10 years are as follows - 1962 1961 I960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 1953 27 22 32 26 23 23 26 27 27 17 Seven residents died through involvement in road accidents The ages of these cases were:- Males 64, 60, 87, 56, 55 Females: 78, 60 Four of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough, three pedestrians (aged 78, 87 and 56) and a pedal cyclist (aged 55). In all, nine persons, including residents of other places, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick 2 motor cyclists, 1 motor car passenger, 1 pedal cyclist and 5 pedestrians None of these were children. The number who died as a result of road accidents within the Borough in 1961 was 15, so that the 1962 figure is quite an improvement 482 persons were killed, or injured, in road accidents on Brentford and Chiswick roads during 1962, compared with 534 in 1961, and 512 in 1960, Birth Rate During 1962, the number of live births recorded was 1,016, 897 legitimate and 119 illegitimate. There were 14 still-births, 11 male and 3 female. The Birth Rate rose again from 17 46 in 1961 to 18 41 in 1962. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General This then gives a comparative birth rate of 17,67 compared with 18.0 for England and Wales as a whole INFANT MORTALITY There were 21 deaths of infants under 1 year of age (the same figure as in 1961), giving an infant mortality rate of 20,67 for 1962 The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 21 6 for England and Wales The graph on page 19 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century The number of premature infants born in 1962 was 63 (78 in 1961) including 10 premature stillbirths Of the 53 premature infants born alive, 5 were born at home, of whom four were surviving at the end of one month, 48 were born in hospital, of whom 41 survived to the end of one month. 17- The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) was 6.1. This is an improvement on the previous year when the percentage was 8.0. The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1951 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 4.5 5.6 4. 9 6. 0 6.9 6. 4 8. 4 7.3 6. 6 8.1 8.0 6.1 Causes of infant deaths are shown in Table II on page 74. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil During the year, 72 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 66 in 1961 One case occurred after home confinement, 71 were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital 13 of the cases were residents of the Borough., The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100 4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage" -18- PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained, and are as follows:- Number of children examined:- Primary Schools 9,314 Secondary Modern Schools 3,551 12,865 Number of children requiring treatment 91 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 64 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 38 For detail see Table XI on page 82. The figures for infestation with vermin deteriorated slightly during 1962. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin, can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station. During 1962, 5 persons were referred for cleansing, 3 for scabies, and 2 for lice. INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1962, the amount of infectious disease notified was very small. Puerperal pyrexia, measles and scarlet fever were the only diseases to be notified in double figures, and even these were mild and without complications. Measles The following figures of measles notifications show the fluctuations of this disease during the past ten years. 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 810 47 659 107 773 330 328 47 542 38 Poliomyelitis Two notifications of anterior poliomyelitis were received during the year. Neither case was confirmed as being poliomyelitis. The Scheme for inoculation against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, continued during 1962. Details of the year- s work are as follows:- No of persons who received 3 doses of oral vaccine Born in the following years: 1 962 1961 1943 - 1960 1933 - 1942 Others Total 48 194 74 26 25 367 -20- No. of persons who received 2 injections Born in the following years: 196 2 1961 1943 - 1960 1933 1942 Others Total 7 171 106 129 181 594 No. of persons who received 3 injections Born in the following years 1962 1961 1943 - 1960 1933 - 1942 Others Total - 24 286 193 410 913 173 primary school children received a fourth injection during the year, 652 primary school children received an oral boost after 3 injections No. of persons liven an oral boost after 2 injections Born in the following years 1961 1943 1960 1933 - 1942 Others Total 106 372 72 177 727 The use of the Sabin method of vaccination, i.e vaccine given by mouth instead of by injection was begun in the County Clinics early in the year. Although this was a quick and painless method of obtaining immunity, it did not seem to increase the rate of infant vaccination much in 1962. Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia was 72 in 1962 compared with 66 in 1961, There was no severe infection, these puerperal pyrexia cases were mild and mostly notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° in the immediate post-natal period after confinement. Smallpox The great increase in the amount of vaccination against smallpox recorded below was the result of the newspaper publicity given to the occurrence of a few cases of smallpox imported into London via the Airport from Karachi, where smallpox had become epidemic No mass vaccination scheme was put in force, but help was given to the local general practitioners by the provision of a daily lymph carrying service carried out by the Departmental staff, and by this means a satisfactory increase in the vaccination rate of the population was obtained Departmental work was further increased by the number of International Certificates of Vaccination which had to be authenticated as many European and other countries insisted on vaccination before entry of travellers, 15 contacts of smallpox cases were notified to the office, in addition to a number of reports of remote contacts from Wales where a hospital outbreak occurred. Vaccination was offered and surveillance of contacts was carried out until the period of quarantine was over in each case, A number of chicken pox cases were also reported as suspect cases and had to be visited and cleared of suspicion One case of vaccinia was notified from hospital and another was seen at home. These were cases in which the patient infected himself from his own -21- vaccination, and developed further vaccination pustules and feverish symptoms These cleared satisfactorily and no deaths resulted from vaccination, nor did any smallpox cases develop Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1962 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were: Under 1 l Age Groups 2 - 4 5 - 14 15 to over Total vaccinated for first time 221 184 152 659 976 2,192 re -vaccin ated - 6 56 488 2,194 2,744 Total 221 190 208 1,147 3,170 4,936 Total number of first vaccinations:- 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 373 548 487 438 418 430 531 525 455 584 2,192 It can be seen from this Table that infant vaccination was not carried out even to the extent of the 1961 amount, the total for the year for infants up to the age of two years being only 411 compared with 479 in 1961 Vaccination of persons intending to travel abroad has to be confirmed by the vaccinating doctor on an International Certificate of Vaccination which is not acceptable unless the signature is authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health During 1962 2,681 such Certificates were authenticated, compared with 439 in 1961. Scarlet Fever There was again a fall in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such the figure being 18 in 1962 compared with 23 in 1961, and 39 in 1960 3 of these cases were admitted to hospital Two cases occurred at the same time in one household, but there were no secondary cases during the year. Whooping Cough Three cases of whooping cough occurred in 1962, Immunisation against whooping cough is fairly general now the inoculation being carried out either simultaneously with that for immunisation against diphtheria, or in series alternating with anti diphtheria inoculation, and outbreaks of whooping cough have not been occurring during the past few years No deaths occurred from this disease during 1962 Diphtheria No case of diphtheria occurred during the year The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948, -22- Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1962 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows - Number of children who Under 1 l 2-4 5 - 14 Total completed a full course of primary immunisation 182 260 25 34 501 received reinforcing injections 3 182 127 180 492 The drop in immunisation of children against diphtheria was considerable, from 823 primary immunisations in 1961 to 501 in 1962,, and from 886 reinforcing injections in 1961 to 492 in 1962. Food Poisoning Five notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. Of these, 2 cases were subsequently not confirmed as food poisoning. Of the remaining three cases, one was established as food poisoning due to the organism Salmonella Typhi-murium,, and the other two cases due to Salmonella organisms, types Bredeney and Newport respectively. Dysentery Two notifications of dysentery were received. Both were confirmed as having been caused by Shigella Sonnei No contacts were affected. Influenza Influenza was not a major problem in 1962, although in the early part of the year some cases occurred, and three deaths from this disease or its complications were recorded Typhoid There was one case of typhoid fever during 1962. The case was an adult male who had been visiting Las Palmas He was treated in hospital. Contacts were followed up and found to have no infection, In March a contact of a passenger on a ship arriving in this country from Karachi who had contracted typhoid fever was notified, but no infection developed. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1962 was 51 as compared with 47 in the previous year, the pulmonary cases amounting to 47 and the nonpulmonary to 4. The number of deaths from this disease was five as compared with one in 1961, one in 1960, two in 1959, seven in 1958, four in 1957, six in 1956 and seven in 1955. The figure of 51 notifications includes 22 inward transfers i.e. cases notified because they had removed into the Borough but who had previously con-' tracted the disease elsewhere. This leaves a total of 29 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough compared with the figure of 32 new cases in 1961, -23- Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic, They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B.C.G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis. B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative. i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases, 46 children from Brentford and Chiswick were given B.C.G. at the Chest Clinic in 1962. A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals, there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients. Facilities for convalescence, rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. B.C.G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the Tuberculosis Vaccinations Clinical Trial, which took place from 1950 to 1960, that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B.C.G. a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary vaccination of school children at the age of 13 During 1962, 749 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 616 consents were received These children were tuberculin tested and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation, 153 positives were so referred B.C.G. vaccination was carried out on 375 children 3 contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic, All tests and vaccinations during 1962 under this scheme were carried out by Middlesex County Council staff HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1962 The housing conditions of 33 of the 51 new cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows:- 32 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, (13 in flats 7 in houses 12 in lodgings or furnished rooms), but in one of these cases, the property was old dilapidated and subject to dampness. One of the patients lived in overcrowded conditions. The housing particulars of 18 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting. 24 Pour new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis. 22 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick. Of the three families previously reported in 1961 as living in old property, subject to dampness, two were rehoused by the Council, and a similar case reported in 1960, moved away from the district. Mass X-Ray During 1962, the mobile Mass X-ray unit made short visits to certain factories in the Borough and a more prolonged visit was made in the autumn with much publicity and an invitation to citizens to take the opportunity of attending during public sessions. One Brentford and Chiswick resident was found to be an active case of tuberculosis, another found to be a lung cancer case, and a further three were observation cases. It is now possible to send persons desirous of availing themselves of the facility, to a static Mass X-ray Unit at West Middlesex Hospital without an appointment on any day of the week, to have an X-ray of the chest. This is a very valuable addition to the armaments of preventive medicine and is made use of by many who need reassurance because of vague suspicions of contact. It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtaining of quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff. -25- -26- FOOD CONTROL Work on the observation and improvement of hygienic reception, storage, and sale of food continued throughout the year. There were no prosecutions required because of failure to comply with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, The number of articles brought to the notice of the staff of the Public Health Department because of suspected unfitness for human consumption or because of being in some respect not of the nature, substance, or quality demanded, was slightly higher than in 1961, but legal action was taken in fewer cases , Details can be found on page 30 Observations of the management of food handling pre paration and vending continued in canteens, shops, public houses, and food shops, and considerable attention was paid to hawkers of food, market food stalls and ice-cream vendors. Although there are still food premises which need much visiting and attention, many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act in their sanitary provisions. Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 17 Butchers 38 Club Canteens 13 Confectioners (Sweets) 93 Cafes, Restaurants, Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 68 Factory and Staff Canteens 53 Fishmongers 15 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 50 Grocers and Provisions and General Stores 115 Ice Cream Manufacturers 2 Public Houses and Off Licences 83 School Canteens 16 Total 563 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year, routine visits were paid to two ice cream manufacturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream, ice cream lollies, etc, for analysis. In addition, samples were taken from suppliers of ice cream etc, manufactured in premises not within the Borough. Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manufacturing apparatus were made and these were at all times, other than as reported below, found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations. -27- Sampling During the year, 110 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under:- Grade Ice Cream Ice Lollies Cream Lollies Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory factory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory I 39 - - 4 - - 2 - - II 48 - - - - - 2 - - III - 7 - - - - - - - IV - - 8 - - - - - - Totals 87 7 8 4 - - 4 - - These figures show great improvement on those for the previous year, only 8 unsatisfactory samples being found compared with 29 in 1961. The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades set up by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing, in relation to ice cream testing:- Grade C1assification Bacterial Covnt I Below 500 II 500 - 20,000 III 20,000 - 100,000 IV If count is over 100,000 and/or Faecal Coli present In the area served by Ealing Public Health Laboratory, the bacteriological count which is carried out and the results of which are tabulated here, is much more sensitive than the chemical tests used elsewhere Although these chemical tests are sufficient for statutory requirements, the fact that the Medical Director of the Ealing Laboratory prefers the stricter control, is something for which the Borough citizens can be grateful, as manufacturers of ice cream who have factories in other areas or who send out their products sometimes find that ice cream passed elsewhere as suitable for consumption because of the results of the chemical test, are in a less happy position here because the gical findings lead to investigations and requests for improvement of equipment or hygienic method. Registration of Premises Ice Cream The total number of premises registered for the sale of ice cream in accord ance with Sec. 16, Food & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under:- Sale only 157 Manufacture and Sale 2 Storage only 2 Total 161 -28- Preserved Foods The total number of premises registered in connection with the manufacture and/or preparation of preserved foods under Section 16 of the Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under:- Sausage manufacture 5 Sausages and pickled meat 13 Cooking of ham and other meats 5 Total 23 190 visits were paid during the year to premises registered under this section. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 277 contraventions of the above-named Regulations were found and 168 remedied during 1962. Details of these contraventions are as follows:- Contravention Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 18 7 Articles/Equipment not in good order 17 12 Food so placed as to involve risk of contamination 3 4 Absence of or inadequate first aid materials 6 - Personal cleanliness not observed 2 2 Water Closets not kept clean and in efficient order 25 17 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 13 10 Absence of "Wash your hands" notices in water closets 1 - Absence of suitable and sufficient wash hand basins 13 4 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash hand basins 20 7 Absence of soap, nail brushes, clean towels, etc, near wash-hand basins 10 4 Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 6 3 Absence of suitable and sufficient sinks for the washing of food and equipment 2 - Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over sink 4 3 Absence of soap, clean cloths etc. at sink 1 1 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms 4 3 Walls, floors, ceilings etc not kept clean 38 19 Walls, floors, ceilings etc, not kept in good order 17 13 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 10 9 Accumulations of refuse etc. 11 4 Specified foods not stored at prescribed temperature 3 2 Inadequate or defective drainage 12 12 Absence of proper storage of food 5 2 Animals on premises 2 2 Rat proofing required 27 25 Defective structure 7 3 Totals 277 168 No prosecutions were undertaken for contravention of these Regulations -29- CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS 125 visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 70 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was quired, FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year, 24 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department 14 cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows:- Complaint Action taken Hair in tin of liver salts Warning letter. Mould in steak and kidney pies Warning letter. String in bread Warning letter. Solder in tin of spam Warning letter. String in bread No action. Cement in milk bottle No action. Caramelised rice pudding No action. Mortar in milk bottle Warning letter. Mould in bread No action. Sheet rubber in small white loaf Court action = £25 fine and £5. 5s. 0d costs.

Foreign body in white loaf No action. FOOD SAMPLING By the courtesy of the Chief Officer, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available- Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 7 - Butter 21 - Cream 13 - Drugs 1 - Fish and Fish Products 18 - Fruit (all kinds) 29 - Ice Cream 23 - Liver 14 - Margarine 4 - Meat and Meat Products 40 3 Preserves 3 - Sausages 2 - Soft Drinks and Fruit juices 5 - Sweets 2 - Vegetables 11 5 Vinegar 14 - Miscellaneous 13 1 Totals 220 9 -30- The total number of samples taken was greater in 1962, i.e. 220 in 1962 compared with 185 in 1961, The number of unsatisfactory samples increased from 7 in 1961 to 9 in 1962. The following are the details from the Chief Officer’s report on the 9 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken:- Meat and Meat Products Arising from the purchase of 3 samples of minced beef from a butcher in this area each of which samples was found to contain sulphur dioxide, which is a preservative not permitted in this class of meat product The butcher was prosecuted and was fined £15 and ordered to pay £7. 7s. 0d. towards the costs. Vegetables It was found that a potato farmer and merchants in Lincolnshire was supplying to a wholesaler in the area potatoes which had been washed and peeled and preserved with sulphur dioxide At the time when the samples were procured the Preservative in Food Regulations of 1962 had not come into force. The potatoes shouldnot have been preserved at all In addition to samples of the raw potatoes as supplied by the farmer, samples were also procured of the potatoes after they had been chipped and fried, steamed, and roasted, The proportion of sulphur dioxide found in the raw potatoes was considerably higher than would have been permitted had the new Regulations been in force. The quantities of preservative present in the cooked potatoes was considerably reduced by the cooking processes. Investigations showed that the farmer had thought that he was permitted to add the preservative providing this was done on the instructions of his customer. He had, he claimed obtained these instructions from the Brentford wholesaler and the effect was that he was selling raw potatoes unprocessed and processing them after sale The Brentford wholesaler denied that there was such an agreement, although he was aware that the potatoes were being treated. Having regard to the imminent coming into force of the new Regulations it was decided not to prosecute either firm but to send them letters of caution. Miscellaneous Samples A sample of a product labelled "Chicken Fritters" was procured from a retailer in the Borough It was considered that the quantity of chicken present in the product was not sufficient to justify the name This matter is being dealt with by correspondence, and the matter has not yet been resolved. Examination of Samples In addition to samples purchased in the Borough labelled stacks and displays of fish (57), meat (43), apples(145), citrus fruit (27), plums (15), offal (29), and potatoes (31), were examined in 110 shops Formal samples are selectively procured based on these examinations of labelled displays of natural foods where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the label or where there is need for further more detailed examination, The inspectors of the Public Control Department have over a number of years acquired a considerable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and varieties of fish and fruit. New Legislation In 1962, Regulations were introduced dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers in food, and with preservatives in food, In addition there has been an amended food standard relating to table jellies. The effect of the Regulations dealing with emulsifiers and stabilisers and with preservatives is to define and limit the additives, and (in the case of preservatives), to extend the range of foods -31- in which preservatives are allowed and the types of preservative which are permitted,, but nevertheless closely limiting the quantities of such preservatives. No infringements arising from the new Regulations were reported during the year. The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887-1953 Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied Inspections were made at 147 premises and 93 stacks and displays of meat 156 of apples 67 of tomatoes, 72 of poultry, 17 of bacon and 11 of offal were examined for compliance with the Orders, Minor infringements have been dealt with by verbal warnings A letter of caution was sent to a butcher who applied a false trade description as to the size of eggs The eggs were advertised by means of a show ticket describing them as large when in fact the eggs were, in the medium and standard weight ranges. Safe Milk Sixty eight samples of pasteurised or sterilised milk were procured from retailers in the district and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed No failures have been reported Seventy two inspections of premises in which milk is pasteurised or at which it was sold were carried out during the year to ensure that the premises con cerned conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regula tions, 1960. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953 This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller or to bear a registered trade mark, to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation, and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is dis closed A total of 101 premises were visited in connection with the Order. and 1, 128 articles of food were examined. Arising from these inspections in this Borough, a firm was sent a letter of caution for failing to disclose on packets of onion and parsley sauce mix all the information required by the Order, A letter of warning was also sent to a manufacturer of a pepper sauce on which the statutorily required statements were inconspicuous Labelling and Advertising of Foodstuffs A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, while it did not arise from samples and inspections in the area of Brentford and Chiswick nevertheless had the effect of protecting the residents of this county district. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the County Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the labels of foods the name and address of the packer or labeller Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not bear a statement of ingredients One manufacturer of ice cream was found to be putting all the statutory declara tions on the base of the carton He was reminded that these declarations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin The Merchandise Marks Act requires this, and letters were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligations to declare the origin in advertisements Some prepacked lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be -32- in half inch letters; the lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. Matters dealt with under the Pood and Drugs Act by correspondence included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than was considered sufficient to justify the title. Five examples of cake mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions, such as egg or milk were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified, and he amended his labels to delete the claim. A sample of cream was procured which was labelled "thick cream". The fat content of this cream was less than the standard prescribed for thick cream and the product was relabelled "sterilised cream". A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was "full of lean red meat". In fact, the meat content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained "more meat". In fact the percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be "vitamin enriched" The vitamins present did not provide one half of the daily requirement which. it is considered, is the minimum to support claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to "vitamin fortified" which, because vitamins were added, was true. A sample of ice lollies for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not to be correct The lollies originally it was found had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe. The label was not amended to conform to the new recipe, and was therefore incorrect. Reference to glucose was deleted from the new labels. A sample of butter mintoes was labelled "made with butter". This was not true, other fats were present as well The label was amended after representations to the manufacturer to "contains butter". A sample of sodium fluoride tablets was found on analysis to be deficient of the stated amount of the chemical. Because, in spite of the deficiency in the chemical, it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired, the manufacturer was not prosecuted but was sent a letter of caution. Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution Similar action was taken in respect of a sample of dried apricots which were found to contain sulphur dioxide The quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared, and the manufacturers were required to amend the label. A firm of confectionery importers was cautioned for selling sweets containing colouring matter not permitted. The firm had withdrawn from retailers sweets imported earlier, and had thought the stock from which the samples was procured was satisfactory. Only permitted colours are now used. -33- During the year a manufacturer put on to the market with a large scale newspaper advertising campaign a new product which consisted of 99% pure sugar with 1% of saccharin It was claimed for this product that it was "Slimmers Sugar". The manufacturer was challenged on the ground that the product (because it contained saccharin) was not sugar. Exception was taken to advertising matter for the same reasons Correction of advertising matter and the labels was secured, the manufacturer devising a new description for his product. An advertisement for vitamin capsules made extravagant claims. On being challenged, the advertiser modified his literature so as to delete the objectionable wording used. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick. FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR 1962 Fruit and Veget1ables 28½ tons Meat and Bacon 4¾ cwts Frozen Foods (defrosted) 1,830 pkts Tinned Foods 3,932 tins Fish 6 stone Unsound food is disposed of by incineration, tipping or for animal feeding. MILK From 1st January, 1961, all licences for milk dealers were required to be issued by the Food and Drugs Authority i,e. Middlesex County Council. Registration of milk distributors is still carried out by the Public Health Department, At the end of 1962, there were 72 such premises registered. BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 6 BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers, It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council, The Corporation employs a staff of 18 at the market and there are approximately 450 holdings with 142 tenants. On busy days roughly 1,500 vehicles pass through the Market. Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the market. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the Market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc. and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. -34- HEALTH EDUCATION The need for education in healthy living is more apparent now than is the need for education in the prevention of disease, and the emphasis is gradually changing from the monitory "Don't do this or that" because you will suffer, to "Do do this or that" and you will maintain mental and physical health That is not to say that the dangers of dirty or careless habits has lessened, but there are signs that the Health Education of many years has made an impression on the general outlook, though not to the same extent as in America or in the Northern European Countries where we are considered to be dirty people., because of the appalling amount of litter thrown on our streets and public places, and because of our inefficient plumbing which is so susceptible to breakdown in high temperatures, low temperatures, wind and storm But when the facilities are there, and the provision of these improves every year, the people are learning to make use of them. In many schools handwashing before meals is insisted on, as it should be in every home spitting in streets and in public vehicles is ceasing to be seen very often, handkerchiefs are used automatically by most people who cough and sneeze, and the use of immunisation and vaccination is well in the public consciousness. In January, the Central Council for Health Education held a Seminar on the subject of "Parents and Children" The main emphasis was on the production of good relationships with and management of children to ensure mental health. Prior to the visit of the Mass X-ray Unit to Chiswick Town Hall, much publicity was arranged in newspapers, by posters, by the display of large street banners showing the dates of the visit, and by a house to house delivery of handbills to every house in the Borough carried out by the friendly offices of volunteers, including the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. -35- WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1962, 28 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. These cases are brought to our notice often by persons who feel the old person should be removed compulsorily for his or her own benefit but not everyone knows the extent of the voluntary and statutory aid which can be given to an old person in need, and so happily, most of the time arrangements of some kind can be made to enable the old person to continue to live in the way which he wants in his own home or by patient persuasion over a long period to get him into a frame of mind which accepts voluntary admission to home or hospital. Compulsory removal is a sad and undignified incident in the life of a human being, and must be genuinely and fully justified before being used. In 1962, no compulsory removal of any old person was carried out. Details of the 28 cases are as follows:- Removed to hospital 10 (5 of whom were rehabilitated and returned home) Removed to Old People's Home 1 Left district to stay with relations 2 Left district to enter private Home 1 Remained at home:- 14 (a) meals on wheels and home help provided 2 (b) meals on wheels and home nurse provided 2 (c) home help and home nurse provided 1 (d) clothing supplied and visiting arranged 2 (e) meals on wheels provided 2 (f) no help required 2 (g) home help only provided 1 (h) deaf aid battery renewals arranged 1 (i) all help refused 1 During the year a total of 377 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service, and the Home Nurses dealt with 483 old people out of a total of 783 cases. These figures compare with 378 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1961 and 469 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 755. Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 38 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People's Homes through the County Welfare Department, including six persons previously brought to our notice (one in 1958, three in 1960, one in 1961 and one in 1962) and three persons from our Meals on Wheels Service recipients. One of the 1960 cases unfortunately did not wish to remain, returned home, and continues to be a very difficult problem. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948 of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them, and it does this by admission to its own Homes or by meeting the cost of maintenance in Homes administered by registered Voluntary Organisations The county Council" s Welfare Department is responsible for the county Homes and one such Home (known as Belfairs, in Grove Park Gardens) is situated in the Borough. -36- During 1962, it was decided to broaden the scope of departmental enquiries into the needs of elderly people. Instead of awaiting a call for action when distress was very great, a friendly visit by the Council's Welfare Officer to persons receiving the Meals on Wheels Service was to be made and an enquiry form discreetly completed Any needs ascertained were to be supplied if possible through the various voluntary and statutory agencies and arrangements made for intermittent or regular visiting by suitable persons if the need for this was brought out. There were, of course, also during the year, appeals for distressed cases, but not so many as in 1961, and it was found, too, that the amount of visiting requested was far greater than the number of persons available to make the visits. A form of chain reaction was set up by this method, as visitors found further needs during their visits, referred them to the Department and so other help was able to be given, A large scale drive by the Mayor of the Borough for more voluntary visiting and help met with an enthusiastic response. It has been stressed many times that in no way must people be visited or helped against their inclinations, no idea of interference into private lives must ever be sanctioned, and the scheme is working very well now. The amount of information on needs, acknowledged needs, of elderly persons living alone should presently give an indication of the most important social provisions which should be made to supply these needs. 150 persons in receipt of meals during the year were visited and their reports on the first visit in each case have been summarized. The list of needs ascertained was quite considerable and with the exception of arrangements for review of glasses, provision of transport, holidays for handicapped persons, admission to old people" s welfare homes and provision of ground floor housing, all the needs in the following list were dealt with. Ascertained requirements: Visiting 38 Wireless 5 Review of glasses 60 Home Help 13 Walking stick 7 Wheelchair 3 Clothing 11 Fuel 4 Bedding 11 Handrail 2 Household utensils Admission to Old or equipment 5 People's Home 3 Fireguard 9 Home Nursing 14 Transport for Club Library service 1 meetings 10 Shopping 1 Lowering of gas or Ground Floor housing 4 electric meter 17 National Assistance 1 Holiday 28 Barbering 2 Deaf aid 3 Dental treatment 1 Chiropody 27 Laundry 1 House repairs 10 In addition, 7 homes were found to be using dangerous oil heaters and 3 had unsuitable or dangerous fires. These were remedied. It will be seen that the needs were extremely varied and as in the case of several of them, danger to the health or even the safety of the old people was inherent in the lack of provision for these needs, that here there is a considerable problem. The number of persons on the meals list is still much below the number of elderly persons living alone and unaided. -37- Chiropody The service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at the surgeries of local chiropodists at reduced cost or free of charge The number of persons treated in this scheme was 104 in 1962, an increase from 82 treated during the previous year. A voluntary service of Chiropody is maintained by the Brentford Philanthropic Society for old people in the Brentford end of the Borough and served by a local chiropodist The fee to the patient is one shilling per foot and 140 treatments were carried out in 1962. The County Council Clinic Service held at the Brentford Clinic and the Chiswick Clinic also expanded during the year, and 199 persons had treatment there compared with 147 in 1961- The total number of Clinic attendances was 892 for the year. Although there is steady expansion of this scheme, it is still handicapped by the difficulty of obtaining chiropody practitioners The service is a very important one for the maintenance of health of old people, immobility through deformed feet leads to physical and mental deterioration, and it is good to be able to report a considerable expansion of the service Arrangements are also possible for housebound to be brought by ambulance or car to the clinics or in more difficult cases for treatment to be given at home. As the schemes get better known and as the amount of visiting of the elderly by voluntary or statutory workers who can inform them of facilities available, increases the demand for the service is rising and there is a waiting list for the chiropody Clinics. The really sad thing however, is that most of these deformed feet need never have become so and stresses the importance for care of the feet and the production of fashion shoes which mould to the feet, rather than of feet that mould to the shoes. Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April, 1955, for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and Chiswick The club is open Monday to Friday from 1-5p.m. and there is an organiser in attendance Central heating was installed in the autumn which was a great boon for the Club members during the ensuing hard winter. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week and there are 250 names on the register. The members can visit every day if they wish for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts whist drives, etc. A television set is installed in the lounge a radiogram in the concert hall and a large billiard table is pro vided for the male members Light refreshments are available This club also arranges summer outings (of which there were five in 1962) and an annual Christ mas party Two visits to West End Theatres at a cheap price were arranged during the Christmas season. Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them such as laundry shoe repairs and hairdressing, and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private lives, A special blend -38- of tea and a milk beverage are also available at economical prices. Members living alone are encouraged to make use of the S.O.S. card scheme, and have the card ready and completed with personal details for window display should an emergency occur. This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members, for social and recreational purposes. Brentford Old Folks Social Club This club meets every Wednesday 1.30 p.m. - 5 p.m. and has 150 members The meetings are social with periodic visiting entertainers There were two free outings in 1962 with a gift of 5s„ Od, for each person for tea on these occasions; also a free tea once per month and two annual parties. Old Age Pensions Association (Brentford Branch) The membership of this Club is over 100. There is a weekly meeting of a social nature with occasional Concert Parties. Two free outings per year, an annual tea and a Christmas dinner are held. The Association runs a penny a week club for sickness and deaths. Old Age Pensions Association (Chiswick Branch) This association has a membership of 120 and meets weekly for social purposes. A free annual outing and Christmas Tea Party are held. and in 1962 additional outings were arranged and paid for by the members of the Association themselves. Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified elsewhere in this report contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly, i.e. the British Red Cross Association, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Blind Club, the Club for the Hard of Hearing, the two Philanthropic Societies and the Chiswick Mission The last named owns two houses which are let to aged persons- the number of tenants is eight, and the tenants, each of whom has one room, pay a small nominal rent. Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at reduced rates (2d. per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments, 2,088 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1 306 in Brentford. Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition. The Meals on Wheels Service operated by the Brentford and chiswick Welfare Organisation continued to expand during 1962 Many times the two vans, which are now in operation each day from Monday to Friday, were required to take round a number far in excess of the normal capacity, and still a waiting list of old persons requiring the meals had to be maintained The number of meals rose from 17,215 supplied to 168 elderly persons in 1960, to 22,118 meals supplied to 192 persons during 1961. In 1962, the figure rose again, and 26,874 meals were supplied to 204 persons, and the need for a third van was becoming really urgent. -39- Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, started in the autumn of 1956 was carried on throughout the year Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources then arrangements were made for the Department's van to call each week to collect the soiled linen deliver it to the laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person. No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee. During the year three old persons had been recommended for, and obtained this service. Holidays for the Elderly In May 1962 40 elderly persons were provided (by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation) with a free holiday for one week Holidays for elderly persons were also provided by other local organisations, viz the two Philanthropic Societies and Chiswick Mission. Hone Safety Following the passing of the Home Safety Act, 1961 (to enable local authorities to promote safety in the home and to make contributions to voluntary organi sations whose activities consist of, or include, the promotion of safety in the home), a Home Safety Sub Committee was set up Its function was "to consider, make recommendations and submit reports to the Public Health Committee on all matters relating to Home Safety within the Borough" Co-opted members included representatives of local medical practitioners, the British Red Cross Society, Old People- s Organisations and the Chambers of Commerce The first meeting was held on 25th July, 1962. Methods of obtaining information from hospitals and general practitioners were discussed, but at this stage approval for the provision of a notification fee was not obtained A letter was sent to all local hospitals and general practitioners requesting information about any home accidents to residents of the Borough. Programmes for regular and seasonal propaganda from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents were planned, and a film show was arranged for the following meeting to demonstrate the type of material available. A letter was sent to the local Chambers of Commerce drawing attention to the British Standard B S 2788 for fireguards and asking for the co operation of local traders to sell only fireguards which complied. A member of the Home Safety Sub Committee and the Deputy Medical Officer of Health were appointed representatives to attend a national Home Safety Con ference at Central Hall, Westminster, on 4th and 5th October, 1962. This consisted of a lecture on Home Safety and Health Education' by a Health Education Officer and "Report on the First Year s Work" of the Yvonne Payne Memorial Research Fellowship in Birmingham There was also a demonstration of Practical Training for Home Safety. The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued to arrange for inspections during the year The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. -40- The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. GENERAL The Public Duty Officer of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society have kindly supplied information concerning their welfare work in the Borough. St. John Ambulance Brigade There are 4 Divisions of St. John Ambulance Brigade in this Borough. No. 54 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Division No. 135 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Division No. 95 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Cadet Division No. 86 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Cadet Division The Divisions have 76 (71 in 1961) uniformed members in the Borough who, between them, performed 2,810 (2,508 in 1961) hours of voluntary public duty. The No. 54 Brentford and Chiswick Ambulance Division covers duties at the Brentford Football Ground, at various Sports Meetings and cricket matches. They supply an Instructor for First Aid and organise St. John Ambulance Association classes for the local Civil Defence Corps and they also instruct in First Aid certain local Scout troops.

All members of the Division are also members of the National Hospital Service Reserve and available for duty in the local Hospital when required by the Matron. One member is available at all times to assist in the Old People’s Home in Chiswick and is often called on by the Matron of the Home at a minute’s notice Both First Aid and Home Nursing lectures have been given during the course of the year An innovation during the year was to provide a Good Neighbours scheme and as a result, elderly and infirm people are visited in their own homes. Members of the two Cadet Divisions attend Sports Meetings as messengers and carry out duty at the West Middlesex Hospital and Bel fairs Home for the Aged in Chiswick. British Red Cross Society Brentford, Chiswick and Ealing combine to form Ealing Area Division of this society and work carried on throughout 1962 was as follows:- (1) Arrangement of sessions for the taking of blood for the transfusion service, and the provision of volunteer assistants during the periods of the blood transfusion service operations.

In addition, there is a flourishing Junior Red Cross Unit at Chiswick, some of whose members help at the local hospitals. WELFARE OF THE BLIND AND PARTI ALLY-SIGHTED The County Council is responsible, under the National Assistance Act, 1948 for the provision of welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted. There are resident in the Borough 103 blind and 28 partially-sighted persons. 20 of these are in full time employment; one is in a Workshop for the Blind and one is a Home Worker, and both receive augmentation and supplementation of earnings from the County Council, There are also 4 partially-sighted and 6 blind children under the age of 16 years, 9 of whom are at Special Schools. One young blind person over 16 years of age is still at school and one partiallysighted young person is at a Technical College. The County Council provides a Home Teaching Service for the visitation of blind and partially sighted people in their own homes, the object of which is to enable partially sighted and blind people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows The duties of the Home Teachers include advising blind and partially sighted persons on all problems relating to their welfare and of all the available social services, assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities, giving instruction in Braille and Moon systems of embossed type and in handcrafts Deaf Blind persons also receive the services of a special Home Teacher for the Deaf Blind, A handcraft class is held fortnightly at Christ Church Hall, Turnham Green. The majority of blind persons are either not capable of employment owing to age or infirmity, or for some reason are not available for employment. Amongst the latter are housewives who may receive instruction in carrying out their household duties from the Home Teachers or in residential courses of social rehabilitation. An Old Time Dancing Class for the Blind is held weekly in Ealing and a number of blind residents in the Borough attend. The County Council works in close co operation with Voluntary Organisations, including (a) The Middlesex Association for the Blind, who maintain a Holiday Home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind and assist individual necessitous blind persons and (b) the Social Club for the Blind which meets fortnightly at Christ Church Hall. This Club is maintained and managed by a voluntary Committee, The meeting -42- is a social gathering with an average attendance of 25, with occasional talks, and more usually entertainment, A Christmas dinner and Concert and a Summer Excursion to Hove were arranged in 1962. Members may go away for holidays at reduced prices to two caravans at Lancing, Sussex provided by public subscription from the citizens of Brentford and Chiswick and maintained by Middlesex Association for the Blind. The British Wireless for the Blind Fund supplies wireless sets to registered blind persons through the County Council which maintains all sets for blind and partially-sighted persons. Other services provided directly by the County Council or through a Registered agency, include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts, and assisted holidays for those in need. WELFARE OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS OTHER THAN BLIND Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially sighted are operated by the County Council’s Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948; these cover the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by crippling diseases or congenital deformity. The County Council’s Welfare Department has provided two Welfare Visitors for persons in the Borough who are suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps other than those already mentioned and they work under the direction of the Area Welfare Officer, They visit such persons in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain from statutory or voluntary sources (or both) facilities, appliances, etc., which may benefit them. The help afforded may for example enable the disabled person to take part in social activities , choral classes, dancing classes, attend handcraft classes, obtain a needed holiday, or by provision of ramps for mechanical chairs handrails, lifting hoists and the like, give a previously non-existent measure of mobility to a person who was chair-bound or house-bound. Where the circumstances require it, adaptations to houses, including the provision of downstairs toilet facilities, may be undertaken. During 1962, special adaptations were made to eleven homes in the Borough tenanted by handicapped or elderly persons. Details of the work done are as follows:- Case Type of Accommodation Work Done l Council Flat Rail by bath and at back door. 2 " House Rail by bath. 3 " Flat Rails by toilet and bath. 4 " Flat Rail by bath. 5 " Flat Rail by bath. 6 " Flat Rail by bath. 7 " House Rail on stairs. 8 Private Flat Rails on stairs. 9 Council House Rail by bath. 10 " Flat Rail by bath. 11 " Flat Bathroom door widened Grab handle over bath and toilet. Handrails on walls by bath and toilet. Drive in relaid from front entrance to public footpath at rear. -43- A Home Work Organiser runs a centre where handicapped persons who are unable to obtain employment in open industry but who are suitable for a certain amount of light work are provided with this on a part time basis at the work centre or at home. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given, and membership of a voluntary organisation catering for a particular handicap is facilitated. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate voluntary organisations, to which the County Council makes grants in aid. Brentford and Chiswick choral classes for handicapped persons are held on Friday evenings at Belmont School, Belmont Road, Chiswick, Each year this class takes part in the Choral Festival arranged for handicapped persons by the County Council. Two special coaches with hydraulic lifting device at the back are in use for taking handicapped persons to club activities, handcraft classes and the choral classes These coaches are for those who cannot travel by public trans port or in any other ordinary car or coach Wheelchair cases can be lifted into these coaches and travel while remaining seated in their chairs. At 31st December, 1962, 122 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. J.F. Cronk, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. * * ♦ * ♦ * * * * * ♦ * ♦ * The Brentford and Chiswick Group of the Middlesex and Surrey League for the Hard of Hearing, meets weekly in the Borough, There are social meetings, lip reading and speaking classes, talks and discussions, outings and visits to other groups in the County. The Club has a Welfare Officer who visits sick and housebound members, and in some cases the Club can provide financial assistance The Group numbers 18 with an average attendance of 12-15. In addition to these evening meetings, a new scheme for afternoon discussion groups meeting at members houses is projected. A club for the Physically Handicapped is maintained by Chiswick Mission (a Branch of the Shaftesbury Society), The disablements are various and transport is arranged by the Rotary Club for those who cannot travel easily. The Club meets once a month for social purposes. Holidays are provided for aged people at the Shaftesbury Society Holiday Home at Broadstairs and several Brentford and Chiswick members have had two weeks holiday there There is also a Holiday Camp at Dovercourt for the aged physically handicapped to which several of the Borough s residents have been sent. The West London Branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, which has some 20 members in this Borough, continued its activities during 1962 The work undertaken included the visiting of disabled members in their homes the organis ation of social meetings and the provision of financial help with holidays. WELFARE = RELIEF OF DISTRESS Brentford Philanthropic Society and Chiswick Philanthropic Society are charitable associations which exist to give help to any in need who are as yet outside of the many statutory provisions for Welfare. A request for help is -44- followed by a visit from a representative of the Society and gifts of coal, extra comforts, special foods, or help with payment for holidays are some of the many provisions which have been made. The Chiswick Society gave the following assistance during 1962:- Clothing for 3 persons Grants for debts in needy or sick cases " 2 families Pension grant of 10s. 0d. per week " 3 elderly men Pood " 11 persons Holidays - free for 2 weeks " 2 persons part expenses to Switzerland " 1 child Chiropody Treatment " 2 persons Outing to Brighton with High Tea and 2s.6d. spending money " 123 persons Christmas Gifts of 20s.0d. each " 246 persons Mulligan Trust Fund gift of 5s. 0d. each " 23 persons Free coal was issued to the amount of 2 tons 7 cwts. The Brentford Society gave the following assistance during the period September, 1961 - August, 1962, the financial year of this Society:- Visits to ascertain needs 186 Weekly payments of 10s.0d. to provide Home Help 702 Holidays - free for one week for 80 old persons Chiropody Treatments (1s. 0d. per foot borne by recipients) 140 treatments Annual Old Folk's Tea and Entertainment for 700 old persons Christmas Gifts of 7s 6d and a box of biscuits " 737 persons Free coal was issued to the amount of 65 tons 9 cwts. This Society formed a Housing Association in October, 1960 and in September, 1962, the first tenants of a house converted into flatlets for the elderly took possession. The scheme is a considerable advance on the ordinary type of Eventide Home, as it has independent flatlets, self contained, and nine in number, yet it has quite good Community Services and a Warden Service, WELFARE - SCHOOL CHILDREN In 1962, 662,142 meals and 923,769 bottles of milk each containing one third of a pint were provided at Schools in this Borough. The percentage of children having milk in schools is as follows:- 1962 1961 Primary 98.6 % 97.6 % Secondary 75.3 % 71.7 % Grammar 58.4 % 57.7 % These percentages rose in 1962, but it is interesting to see how difficult it is to get a good acceptance of this service in Grammar Schools, particularly girls' sections of Grammar Schools The girls may like milk well enough but have heard so much about its being fattening that they reject it. -45- The percentage of meals served to daily attendances:- January to December 1962 % of attendance taking meals Average number taking meals Average attendance Primary Schools Belmont Junior Mixed 59 106 181 Belmont Infants' 63 59 93 Beverley Road Infants 89 138 155 Cavendish J.M.& Infants' 61 110 180 Ealing Road J.M.& Infants' 69 262 379 Grove Park J.M.& Infants' 57 126 222 Hogarth Junior Mixed 60 177 293 Hogarth Infants' 52 61 118 Lionel Road J.M.& Infants 72 187 260 St George s J.M.& Infants1 39 42 109 St John s R.C.,J.M.& Infants 81 196 242 St Lawrence with St. Paul's J.M.& Infants' 60 112 187 Strand on the Green J.M. 68 154 228 Strand-on-the-Green Infants 63 95 152 Secondary Schools Brentford Boys 31 97 307 Brentford Girls 40 133 332 Staveley Road Boys' 65 286 438 Staveley Road Girls' 55 226 433 Chiswick Grammar Boys' 53 273 518 Chiswick Grammar Girls' 66 326 493 Gunnersbury Catholic Grammar 66 252 383 -46- ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Estimation, by the volumetric method, of the amount of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere continued during the year at the three stations in operation in the Borough, except that no readings were able to be taken at the Staveley Road Station during January and February owing to alterations being in progress. Details of the readings obtained are submitted monthly to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research where they are collated with those from stations in all parts of the country in a national survey of atmospheric pollution. A summary of the year s recordings is set out in Table XV and Graph "C" has been prepared from these figures This shows that the annual pattern has been repeated once again with the lowest readings occurring from April to September and emphasising the effect that domestic heating and the heating of offices and business premises has on the level of atmospheric pollution. It has been noticed, too, that during the last two years the concentrations of both smoke and sulphur dioxide have tended to increase slightly during the month of March. It is also interesting to note that while smoke concentrations recorded at the Staveley Road station (which is in the area covered by the Borough s first Smoke Control Area), did not differ to any extent from those recorded in other parts of the Borough, the amount of sulphur dioxide in this area during October, November and December was found to be considerably greater than that recorded at the other two stations. It is regretted that it was not possible to take readings at this station during the first two months of the year so that no comparison can be made for this period. During the period 4th to 7th December, 1962, the Greater London area was covered by a dense "smog" which compared, to some extent,, with that experienced in 1952. Indeed, by a remarkable coincidence it began on the same day of the month but did not last quite as long. Below is set out a table showing the concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide, expressed as microgrammes per cubic metre of air, measured at the three stations operating in the Borough during this period and compared with those obtained in 1952. Date 1962 Brentford 1962 Chiswick Heathfield Terrace 1962 Chiswick Staveley Road 1952 Chiswick Heathfie1d Terrace Smoke so2 Smoke so2 Smoke so2 Smoke so2 4th December 840 898 348 996 1116 1359 665 215 5th December 524 2098 1084 2081 1132 2303 642 974 6th December 264 1077 828 992 924 1259 421 2424 7th December 584 1139 756 1352 892 2383 351 886 8th December 351 886 9th December 498 480 Daily Average during period 553 1303 754 1355 1016 1826 488 978 It is unfortunate that only the Heathfield Terrace station was in operation during the "smog" period of 1952 and direct comparison can only be made, therefore, with the figures for that station These show that although the greatest daily concentration of sulphur dioxide occurred on one of the days during the 1952 period, the daily averages for both smoke and sulphur dioxide were considerably higher during the 1962 period. -47- Graph "D" illustrates how the concentrations of smoke measured at the three stations in the Borough compare with those of Leeds, Central London and Lerwick, places chosen as representative of areas from industrial to virtually smokeless. 155 visits, revisits or observations were made during the year in connection with premises which were suspected of causing atmospheric pollution or in respect of which complaints had been received that they were causing such pollution. The number of complaints during the year was 40. 12 of which were not substantiated. Amelioration was obtained in the remaining 28, either by action following discussion, or subsequent to a letter of warning being sent. Three major improvements in business premises were as follows:- Factory in Power Road New incinerator installed with oil fired after-burner which is activated by a photo-electric cell. Factory in Hogarth Lane New boilerhouse with 3 Paxman oil-fired boilers and new chimney stack (90 feet high) constructed. (Not completed until beginning of 1963). London Transport Executive-Turnham Green Garage New boiler house with two sectional oil-fired boilers to chimney stack (40 feet high) constructed. Work on the establishment of further Smoke Control Areas within the Borough has proceeded during the year, full details of which are reported in the next section. Clean Air Act, 1956 The Borough's No 3 Smoke Control Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 15th August, 1962 and the operative date was fixed for the 1st June, 1963. The area covered by the Order comprises 109 acres and contains approximately 1, 564 separate dwellings of which 360 are cil owned Also included in the area are 24 commercial and 5 miscellaneous premises. The three Smoke Control Orders cover a total area of 697 acres, containing approximately 3,395 dwellings and 74 other type of buildings. In June, 1962, the survey of Smoke Control Area No. 4 was commenced.

There are also a small number of catchpits for industrial wastes at industrial premises in the area, now amounting to seven in number. Arrangements for the regular clearing of these cesspools and catchpits are made with the Borough Engineer3 s Department of the Council. Enquiries - Outstanding Sanitary Notices During the year 1 163 enquiries were received from other Departments regarding outstanding sanitary notices with respect to certain properties in the district. The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. WATER SUPPLY AND WATER SERVICES The water supply for the whole of the district is supplied by the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board, One well, which is still in use in the Borough (at Green s Boathouse, Riverside Lands), is used for washing purposes only while drinking water is obtained direct from the mains. Prom time to time reports are issued by the Metropolitan Water Board on samples of water examined chemically, bacteriologically, biologically and for tasting purposes. The samples are taken at various stages ranging from river water to water before and after filtration and to water before and after chlorination. This constant checking ensures that the quality of the water entering the mains is satisfactory at all times, The quantity of the water supply too, has been satisfactory throughout the year. Watch is also kept by the Board on the discharge of any radioactive effluents into waters which contribute eventually to the supplies they are treating, to ensure that the standards laid down are complied with. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The sewerage system for Brentford and Chiswick is mainly a "separate" system in which surface water drainage and foul drainage are kept separate with two sets of drains along streets to which the various connections can be made. In a few of the older areas of the Borough, no surface water drainage exists and in these areas the foul and surface water drainage from properties is all taken into the foul sewer while surface water drainage from highways is taken into soakaways. The surface water drainage system is split into areas throughout the Borough and each area has an outfall into the River Thames There are approximately 18 outfalls of this kind along the length of the River within the Borough. The foul drainage system is based on the two areas of Brentford and Chiswick, each area draining to one point within its boundary. The Brentford area drains to Town Meadow Depot and the Chiswick area to Corney Road Depot. Before the advent of the West Middlesex Drainage Board, the sewage received at Town Meadow Depot was pumped to a sewage disposal plant situated at Clayponds Gardens, and the sewage received at Corney Road Depot was treated at a plant within the Depot, both plants having outfalls into the Thames for effluent. Since the West Middlesex Drainage Board came into operation, the two sewage plants in the -53- Borough have ceased to operate and the two Depots were connected to a trunk sewer owned by the Board and running through the Borough The sewage from the Borough is carried by the trunk sewer to Mogden Works and treated and disposed of there. It must be noted that the drainage system joins the trunk sewer in only two places. The sewerage system of the Borough is, in general, considered to be sufficient to cope with the present and any likely future flows which may result from new development. REFUSE COLLECTION Refuse is collected once per week from each house in the Borough and is disposed of, by collecting freighters, to a Controlled Tip outside the Borough.

It will be seen from the Housing Statistics on page 63 that twenty-four cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. These figures are not as good as in 1961, when there was relief of overcrowding in thirty-four cases, and only eleven new cases were discovered It is realised that cases of statutory overcrowding are usually only brought to the attention of the Medical Officer when circumstances have become very difficult and unmanageable, and that many other overcrowded families are on the Council’s Housing list. -64- Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned, by Council re housing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns. DISINFECTION Premises disinfected Ordinary notifiable diseases 10 Premises treated for vermin 23 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 13 Routine disinfection of blankets, bedding etc. were carried out on the premises in the above table as required. In addition, articles of clothing and bedding, parcels of clothing destined for countries abroad, and when necessary , books for both public and private libraries, were disinfected on the Public Health Department premises. An arrangement is in force whereby the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of smallpoxinfected clothing and bedding on demand. -65- MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 3,917 primary visits and re visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation. The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows:- Private Houses 274 Factories 15 Shops 24 Schools 3 Parks and Open Spaces 7 None of these infestations were severe enough to be classed as major infestations. In addition to the above, two maintenance treatments to the sewers were carried out during the months of May, 1962 and November, 1962, and the following shows the number of manholes found to be infested. Date Manholes found to be infested May, 1962 3 November, 1962 4 The work of Rodent Control is carried out under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector by three Rodent Operatives. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licensed by the local authority. One licence was issued during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Three premises in the Borough are registered for the purpose of the above Act, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 thereof. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Five establishments were inspected under this heading and all were found to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 2 Massage and Electrical Treatment 2 Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 1 FREE WASHING FACILITIES IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCES Facilities for free hand washing are available in the Kew Bridge both "Ladies" and "Men’s" at High Road "Men’s" and Turnham Green "Ladies" Public Conveniences paper towels and liquid soap in tilting dispensers being available in each. In addition a wash hand basin is provided in the "Ladies" convenience in Linden Gardens. -66- During the year 1962, 35,600 paper towels, (24 800 in Brentford, 10.800 in Chiswick), were issued and, in addition, those who preferred linen hand towels and tablet soap were able to hire these at a cost of 3d In the same conveniences 3,584 of these towels were also used This is a steep rise on the figures for former years for paper towels and it has been necessary to terminate the use of linen towels in favour of paper towels, therefore, a further substantial increase in paper towels is anticipated next year. There are no free washing facilities available at the Edensor Road "Ladies", and "Men’s", nor at the Turnham Green "Men’s" conveniences. In one other convenience in the Borough Market Place "Men's and Ladies", free washing facilities are not available as there is no longer an attendant, but it is still kept open weekdays and Sundays from 7.0 a.m. to 8.0 p.m. pending demolition This convenience is planned to be demolished in connection with the plan for the redevelopment of the High Street (east of the Courthouse). RIVER POLLUTION Reports have been received from the Middlesex County Council on samples of water taken by their Officers during the year from points on the River Brent between Wembley and Brentford High Street Although the majority of the samples taken early in the year were found to be satisfactory, subsequent ones, with two exceptions, were not good. The water is not clear and there is evidence of oil entering the river. Mechanical tugs and oil driven barges ply the river daily and their motors inevitably cause more turbulence in the water than did the quiet passage of the horse drawn boats of years gone by. There has been no evidence of any accidental pollution of the river nor has it been found necessary to take action during the year against any person using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district have been allocated for streettrading purposes There were 22 Street Trading sites and during 1962, 20 visits were paid to these sites to verify hygienic conditions. 31 hawkers of food were registered with the Council. CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register:- Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF The following medical examinations of Council staff were carried out during 1962:- No. of examinations for entry into the Superannuation Scheme , 50 No. of examinations following expiration of sick leave 4 -67- NUCLEAR RADIATION Regular reports have been received from the Metropolitan Water Board indicating the amount of radio- active effluent ascertained in the sources of the water drunk locally. During 1962, all discharges from the Atomic Energy Authorities were monitored and declared satisfactory. It is still not known how many local factories are using radio-active materials but registration of these will soon be coming into operation, and the local authority is likely to get to know something more of the use of such materials locally, though at present we are informed that strict control of the issue, transport and use of the substances is maintained centrally. NOISE NUISANCE Eight complaints of nuisance from noise were received during 1962, three were not substantiated, the other five, in respect of small factories, were ameliorated by the factory managements during the year, although in one instance it was necessary to have expert opinion on the intensity of the noise prior to agreement. OFFENSIVE SMELLS Prom time to time complaints of offensive smells require investigation, the source of the smell sought and treated, whether it is an offensive accumulation or faulty sanitation, but a more pervading and persistent odour coming into the Borough from a neighbouring district was the source of some difficulty during the year, as it was coming from a Sewage Works, and proved difficult to ameliorate By the end of the year the prospect of abatement was in sight. -68- HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946.
