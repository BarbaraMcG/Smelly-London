To TIE WORSHIPFUL, THE PORT OF LONDON HEALTH COMMIT TEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London. Circular 210/46 of the Ministry of Health dated 2nd December, 1946, directs as follows "I am directed by the Minister of Health to refer to Circular 60/46 of the 20th March, 1946 and to request that the Port Health Authority will direct their Medical Officer of Health to draw up his Annual Reports for 1946 and subsequent years on the lines indicated in the enclosed memorandum 302/S.A." This directive means that the abridged Reports of the war years are to be discontinued and replaced by a detailed Report comparable to those of the pre-war years. This Report has been drawn up on the lines indicated in memo 302/S.A., in so far as the information asked for is available. (3) The Tonnage of vessels entering the Port of London during 194-6 was 17,314,187 tons as compared with 30,776,918 tons during 1938, the last occasion on which these figures were available. Five thousand five hundred and forty five vessels arrived from foreign ports and of these 1,553 were boarded by your Medical Officers. One hundred and forty one cases of communicable diseases (including malaria) were reported as having occurred on vessels during the voyage of which 79 were landed in the Port. Seventy-one cases, of which particulars are given in Appendix II(b), were admitted to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, Difficulties in the staffing of Denton Hospital necessitated the continuance of the arrangements by which communicable diseases were removed to hospitals in the vicinity of the River. The Disinfector at the Hospital, however, was still at the disposal of the Authority for the disinfection of cases arriving in the Port, their clothing, bedding and effects. No case of human plague occurred during the year on any vessel bound for London. Of the 1,626 rats examined bacteriologically, 1,059 were from vessels and 567 from shore premises. No rat was reported to be infected with plague. One hundred and ninety-one vessels were fumigated for rodent destruction and the issue of International Deratisation Certificates under the supervision of your Inspectors, Four were fumigated with sulphur dioxide resulting in the destruction of 98 rats and 187 with hydrogen cyanide accounting for 3,853 rats and 360 mice. A total of 12,185 rats were destroyed during the course of the year, 6,410 in ships and 5,775 on shore premises in the Port. In addition 1,565 mice were destroyed, 225 in ships and 1,340 on shore premises. The work carried out under the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) Regulations, 1930, still in operation, is reported on page 19. The number of water barges in use in the port was 11. As heretofore, the registration of these craft by the Port of London Authority was made conditional upon the report of your Officers as to the fitness of the barges for the carriage of drinking water. These arrangements continued to work smoothly. No action of any importance was taken in the application of the existing Houseboat Bye-Laws to the houseboats coming within the jurisdiction of the Port Health Authority, New Bye-Laws have been published in order that objections can be made and the Minister of Health is unable to give his approval of the Bye-Laws until such objections have been considered. The total amount of foodstuffs seized and condemned for human consumption and either reconditioned or disposed of for animal consumption or for industrial purposes under guarantee or destroyed was 630 tons as compared with 720 tons during the previous year. The policy of salving foodstuffs and the reconditioning, where possible to render them fit either for human or for animal consumption or for industrial purposes, remained an urgent necessity and was continued throughout the year. Details of the uses to which the foodstuffs have been put are given on page 18. Your Medical Officer would like to take this opportunity of thanking the Officers of His Majesty's Customs, of the Port of London Authority, the Pilots and members of the staffs of the Shipping Companies and Merchants for their collaboration and assistance in every aspect of the work of the Port Health Authority throughout the year. At the close of the year the only member of your permanent staff to be still serving with the Forces was your Deputy Medical Officer of Health, Dr. H.M. Willoughby, the remainder having safely returned and taken up their duties in the Docks, on the River and at the Central Office. I have pleasure in reporting that all members of your staff have carried out their duties both willingly and efficiently. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, M.T. MORGAN.

Source of later Supply - (a) For the Port - All the docks in the London Area obtain their water supplies from the Metropolitan "later Board. Tilbury Dock obtains its water from the South Essex later Company. The majority of the wharves are supplied by Public later Authorities within whose area of distribution they are situated, while several have their own deep wells. A few have no water supplies available for shipping, in which case any water required can be obtained from water boats. (b) For Shipping - Ships usually obtain water from the shore supplies as indicated above but when no water is available at the berth or if a ship is lying at buoys in the river, supplies are obtained from water boats. 2. Hydrants and Hosepipes - Hydrants within the dock area are of the standard type in use by the Metropolitan later Board. These are situated at intervals along the quayside and consist of an upright stackpipe with a nozzle coupling to which are attached the hoses. The hoses* usually of rubber covered with a metal coil, when not in use are coiled up and hung in specially constructed hose boxes at convenient points within the docks. When in use particular care is taken that the hoses do not sag into the dock water and in transference from the ship to shore that at no time do they come into contact with the dock water. If this should happen the hoses are thoroughly cleansed and flushed with fresh water before being used. 3. Number of water boats and their sanitary condition - There were eleven water boats working in the Port during the year. 'later boats are all of steel construction and of the 'single skin' type, i.e., the skin of the boat forms the sides and bottom of the tanks and the deck forms the top. The manholes are raised from 6 inches to 1 foot above the level of the deck and have steel covers, fitted with locks to prevent unauthorised persons dipping water from the tanks into buckets which may be dirty, while the craft is unattended. It is the usual practice to clean the tanks every three months and to cement-wash them every six months. All water boats must be registered annually with the Port of London Authority and before a certificate is granted they must be inspected as to their fitness for navigation in the river and docks. Notification is received that a vessel Is coming up for re-registration by the Port of London Authority and this opportunity is taken by the Port Health Authority to inspect the vessel as to its fitness for the carriage of drinking water. The Port of London Authority await a communication from the Port Health Authority stating that the vessel is in a fit condition for the carriage of drinking water before issuing a certificate;. This arrangement has worked smoothly for a number of years and enables your Officers to get such repairs and improvements as are from time to time necessary, without difficulty. IV. PORT HEALTH REGULAIIONS, 1933 and 1945. (a) Arrangements for dealing with Declarations of Health - Ships bound for London coming up the English Channel take on a Pilot off Dungeness, those coming across the North Sea take on a Pilot at the Sunk Lightship, near Harwich. The Elder Brethren of Trinity House have kindly agreed that Pilots should hand copies of the Declaration of Health to the tasters of (6) the ships they board, and accordingly supplies of the Declaration of Health are sent, from time to time, to Trinity House. The Elder Brethren have, however, stipulated that pilots should not be held responsible for any failure on the part of the Masters to comply with the instructions of the Port Health Authority. Pilots have, however, co-operated willingly and conscientiously and consequently the arrangements are working very satisfactorily. The Port Health Amendment Regulations, 1945, necessitated a slight alteration to the Declaration of Health, page 4 of which (instructions) now reads as follows : - INSTRUCTIONS. (applying only to the Port of London). The Master of a foreign-going vessel approaching a Port an England or Wales from a Foreign Port must ascertain the state of health of all persons on board, and fill in and sign a Declaration of Health in the prescribed form, which he must hand to the Customs Officer or to the Port Medical Officer, whichever first boards the ship. 1. If the answer to any of the questions on page 1 is "YES", or if the ship, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF TANKERS, has called during the previous six weeks at any of the following Ports:- Ports in ASIA, including JAPAN, the EAST INDIES and CEYLON, AFRICA including MADAGASCAR, the CANARY ISLANDS and CAPE VERDE ISLANDS, TURKEY, BLACK SEA, .AZORES, SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA, GULF OF MEXICO, WEST INDIES, the Master must:- (1) Send a wireless message to "PORTELTH LONDON", stating the name of his vessel and the timex she is expected to arrive off Gravesend. This message must be sent off not more than 12 hours and not less than 4 hours before the arrival of the ship. In the case of vessels bound for the Medway, the wireless message must be addressed to "PORTELTH LONDON", but must be as followss:- "(NAME OF VESSEL) (TIME OF ARRIVAL) SHEERNESS." NOTE.- If wireless is not carried, the Port Health Authority must be notified of the arrival of the ship as soon as possible. (2) By day, when within the Port of London, hoist the flag signal LIM, meaning "Port Medical Officer required"; By night, when approaching Gravesend, flash letter "Q" repeatedly from the morse lamp, (3) Have the crew mustered ready for inspection by the Port Medical Officer as soon as he boards the vessel. Free pratique will not be granted by His Majesty's Customs until the vessel has been visited by the Port Medical Officer. II. If the answers to all the questions on page 1 are "NO" and the vessel has not called during the previous six weeks at any of the Ports mentioned above, the Master need not communicate with the Port Health Authority in the manner described above, unless directed to do so by a Customs Officer. NOTE - (a) Where a foreign-going ship comes to a Port in the United Kingdom from a Foreign Port and makes a Declaration of Health, and thereafter within six weeks calls at another Port in England or Wales in completion of its voyage, the Master shall report on arrival to the Customs Officer or Officer of the Port Health Authority, whichever first boards the ship, every case of illness (being a case which, if he were making a Declaration of Health, he would be required to include in the Declaration) which has occurred on the ship since the making of the Declaration and has not already been reported. (b) Article 16(l) of the Regulations states:- Where a ship arrives (7) from a Foreign Port no person other than a Pilot, a Customs Officer, an Immigration Officer, or a person acting in the execution of these Regulations shall, without the permission of the Medical Officer or other authorised Officer of a Port Health Authority, board or leave the ship until it is free from control under these Regulations, and the Master shall take all steps necessary to secure compliance with this provision". M.T. MORGAN Medical officer of Health, Port of London. ??? Name of ship as one word. Time on 24 hour clock. The present practice at Gravesend is that every vessel from 'foreign' is hailed by His Majesty's Customs. When a ship is boarded by one of your Medical Officers, he collects the Declaration of Health. The Customs Officers take the forms from the ships which are not medically inspected and the Boarding Medical Officer collects them daily, usually first thing in the morning when he makes up the list of vessels that have arrived during his 24 hour period of duty. The days batch of forms are then posted to the Central Office together with the Medical Officer's other records and reports. At Sheerness the Declarations of Health are collected by the Medical Officer or the Customs and forwarded by the former with his weekly report. Boarding of Vessels on Arrival - The Port Health Authority maintain at Gravesend a hulk, the "HYGEIA" on which the Boarding Medical Officers live during their tour of duty. The Boarding launch "HOWARD DEIGHTON", which has an ambulance room on deck, lies alongside the "Hygeia". There are three Boarding Medical Officers and three crews for the launch, each having 24 hours afloat and 48 hours ashore. Ships are boarded at any time of the day or night, as soon as they arrive off Gravesend. The "Hygeia" is connected by an underwater cable to the telephone cables ashore and in accordance with the requirements set out in the Declaration of Health, wireless messages sent from an incoming vessel are picked up by the North Foreland Radio Station and transmitted by land cable to the "Hygeia". The Customs also maintain a launch constantly on duty in this reach of the River, and it is here also that the deep sea pilot hands over to the river pilot, Thus all three services are in close touch with one another. When the boarding launch is undergoing overhaul or is, by any other reason temporarily out of commission, the Medical Officer boards from the Customs launch, by courtesy of His Majesty's Customs. During this period an up-river launch is sent to Gravesend to enable the Sanitary Inspector on the lower river district to carry out his duties and remove any case of infectious sickness to hospital. During the latter part of the year your Worshipful Committee has had under consideration the purchase of an additional launch for duty on the Gravesend Station, such a launch to be capable of replacing the "Howard Deighton" while out of commission and thus avoiding the necessity of sending an up-river launch to Gravesend. At other times this launch would be available to the Inspector on the lower river and Gravesend district. Reference is made above to the use of the Customs launch for boarding by the Medical Officer but although the Customs are most generous and courteous in giving every possible facility, their primary duty is to hail and grant pratique to every incoming vessel from 'foreign', consequently they frequently cannot stand by while the Boarding Medical Officer inspects a number of passengers and a large crew or carefully examines cases of sickness which may be of an infectious nature. It is, therefore, obviously desirable that the Medical Officer should always have his own launch so that he can have time to do his work thoroughly without feeling that he is delaying the Customs Officers and making it difficult for them to carry out their own duties. (8) Notifications to the Authority of inward vessels requiring medical attention - Arrangements are in force by which the General Post Office telephone direct to the Medical Officer on duty on the "Hygeia" all messages received, by the North Foreland Radio Station from vessels in accordance with the instructions on the Declaration of Health. There is always a Medical Officer on duty, a launch available and, although Denton Hospital has not yet been re-opened for the reception of cases, arrangements have been made for Infectious oases to be admitted to hospitals at Grays Thurrock and Colchester. Occasionally a vessel voluntarily sends a full Quarantine Message in code, which is deciphered by the Medical Officer from Volume II (Radio) of the International Code of Signals, but practically all messages are received direct from the ships, but when some serious infectious sickness has occurred on board, advance information is received from the Ministry of Health through the Information Bureau of the International Health Offices. Ships requiring medical attention are required to fly the flag signal LIM during the day and to flash "Q" on their morse lamp by night when approaching Gravesend, both signals meaning "Medical Officer required". Mooring Stations designated under Article 10 - Owing to enemy action certain of the mooring stations designated by the Port of London Authority are no longer in existence and the question of alternative moorings is now the subject of correspondence with the Port of London Authority. Particulars of any Standing Exemptions from the provisions of Article 14.- No standing exemptions have been made in regard to ships proceeding above Gravesend but the question of exemption for certain vessels, particularly 'oil tankers' proceeding up the River Medway and to Thameshaven, is at present the subject of correspondence with the Waterguard Superintendent of His Majesty's Customs and Excise, Experience of working Article 16 - (1) As ships are cleared in the River immediately on arrival, no difficulty has been experienced in preventing the embarkation or disembarkation of unauthorised persons. (2) When a ship arrives which has on board a case of one of the major infectious diseases or on which such a case has died or has been landed abroad within the incubation period of the particular disease, it is the practice to regard every person on board as a contact and accordingly to arrange for his observation or surveillance . Those persons intending to leave the ship must give their names and addresses before leaving and this is done by issuing such persons with a specially prepared double post-card, on one half of which he gives full details of his name and the address to which he is proceeding immediately on disembarkation and the other half he is asked to keep and use only should he change his address during a specified period. This half of the card is on the "Business Reply Card" system so that the person concerned does not have to stamp it. What, if any, arrangements have been made for (a) Premises and waiting rooms for medical examination - Medical examinations are usually carried out on board ship but there are rooms available for the medical inspection of Aliens on the Tilbury Landing Stage. (b) Cleansing and disinfection of ships, persons and clothing and other articles Disinfection of infected quarters is usually carried out by the Sanitary (9) Inspector in whose area the vessel berths. Should, however, the space requiring disinfection be large a private firm is employed who carries out the disinfection under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspector. Although Denton Hospital has been closed for the reception of cases, the Disinfecting Station, containing a Washington Lyons Steam Disinfector has been available for the disinfection of clothing, bedding etc. (c) Premises for the temporary accommodation of persons for whom such accommodation is required for the purposes of the Regulations- So far it has not been necessary to make special provision on a large scale, and if the necessity did arise the ship would be detained until temporary accommodation ashore had been found. (d) Hospital accommodation available for Plague, Cholera, Yellow Fever, Smallpox and other infectious diseases- During the closure of Denton Hospital arrangements have been made with the Medical Officers of Health of the Essex County and the Grays Thurrock Rural District Council for the reception of cases of infectious disease. Every endeavour is being made to re-open the Isolation Hospital at Denton in the coming year. (e) Ambulance Transport- The launch "Howard Deighton" used by the Medical Officers as a Boarding launch is fitted with an ambulance room on deck with accommodation for four stretcher cases or eight walking cases. The middle river launch the "ALFRED ROBERTSON" has a fairly spacious after cabin in which a patient could be carried but would only be used as such should the "Howard Deighton" be out of commission. The Port Health Committee has under consideration the building of another launch to work in co-operation with the "Howard Deighton" and in addition has acquired a motor road ambulance which will be put into use when the Hospital re-opens. (f) Supervision of contacts- The method of dealing with contacts who are leaving a ship has been described on page 9. Arrangements for the Bacteriological or Pathological Examination of Rats. The bacteriological examination of rats for plague is carried out in the laboratories of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, Specimens of rats caught in shore premises or killed on board ship by fumigation are collected by the Rodent Officers and conveyed to the Seamen s Hospital in special tin boxes. Each rat has attached to its hind leg a small label on which is written a letter combination indicating the dock where the rat was obtained and a number. In the case of a ship rat, the name of the ship. The daily returns of the Rodent Officers indicate clearly this letter-number combination, with a further note showing exactly where and how each rat was obtained. Should a rat be found to be plague infected the laboratory would at once notify the Medical Officer, quoting the letter- and number on the label attached to the rat in question and a reference to the Rodent Officer's report, would indicate exactly where plague preventive measures should be instituted.

A case of smallpox occurred in a Sailors' Home during the year 1947 and is ported here because of its peculiar circumstances and importance. A resident steward in the Home fell ill on the 3rd March, 1947 and was ??? to be suffering from influenza. His condition rapidly deteriorated and consequence he was admitted to the general ward of a general hospital and remained there, undiagnosed, despite the appearance of a typical semi-confluent ??? rash. Here then was every element in the making of a severe outbreak of smallpox, perhaps so much among the seamen visiting the Hostel, since most seamen are ??? immunised against the disease, but among their shore contacts and among patients in the general hospital. As far as the seamen were concerned immediate action was taken by the Port with Staff to secure the vaccination of all the men who had visited the Hostel who might be potential contacts and this is described in the report hereunder ??? Dring, the Health Inspector who was in charge, under the Medical Officer of ???, of the control measures carried out„ "Case of Smallpox at the Empire Memorial Hostel, Commercial Road, E.14, (Metropolitan Borough of Stepney). On the 10th March, 1947, I attended on the Medical Officer at the Office I and was informed that a resident steward at the Empire Memorial Hostel had been diagnosed as suffering from smallpox, the date of onset of the disease being the 3rd March. The patient had been admitted to a general hospital on the 5th March, with a diagnosis of influenza. On the instructions of the Medical Officer, I proceeded to the Hostel and (12) Arrangements made for other Bacteriological and Pathological Examinations . All bacteriological and pathological examinations are carried out at the laboratories of the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich. Arrangements for the diagnosis and treatment of Venereal Diseases among Sailors, under International arrangements. The Venereal Diseases are not compulsorily notifiable but efforts are made t bring to the notice of all seamen using the Port the facilities for free treatmen under the Brussels Agreement. When the Medical Officers board ships on arrival they always enquire whether there are any cases of venereal disease on board and should there be a case the infected person's attention is drawn to the importance of obtaining skilled treatment as soon as possible and to acquaint him with the situation of the Clinic nearest the ship's berth and the times at which cases may attend. Similarly the Sanitary Inspectors have a supply of pamphlets listing the nan and addresses of places of treatment together with the days and times such treatment is available and in addition the Port Health Authority have printed this notice in 21 different languages and these notices are pasted up at vantage point throughout the whole dock area. Arrangements for the interment of the dead. "When cases of infectious disease die in the Port Health Hospital, arrangement for interment are made with an undertaker in Gravesend. TABLE C.

(11) on arrival found that no vaccination of the persons occupying the hostel, neither staff nor residents (lodgers) had taken place. I, therefore, suggested to the Public Vaccinator of Stepney who had attended to vaccinate the staff, that all the residents in the hostel should immediately be offered vaccination. This was found to be impossible at the moment since daily registration for accommodation was the rule. In other words intending residents (lodgers) had to register between 12 noon and 4.0 p.m., daily and had to vacate their cubicles by 10.0 a.m., the following day, no matter how many nights they slept in the hostel. I thereupon arranged with the Manager for all the residents to be notified on registering that vaccination would be commenced at 11.0 p.m., since nobody could either enter or leave the hostel after that hour. Vaccination was subsequently carried and completed by 3.0 a.m. A list was obtained from the Manager of all residents who had used the hostel and left since the 4th March. Armed with this list, numbering 159 persons,, the five Mercantile Pool Officers were contacted and given a copy of the list and requested to obtain either the home addresses or the names of the ships on which persons appearing in the list, had sailed. The Pools were instructed that should any of the contacts be still awaiting ships they should not be 'signed on' and any that reported for duty should be referred back to the hostel. As a result of the information subsequently received from the Pools, wireless messages were sent to ships at sea on which contacts had sailed informing the Masters of the circumstances and communications were sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which contacts were spending their leave. No new residents were accepted at the hostel and no person resident on or before the 10th March was allowed to leave until the 27th March. Those contacts who were employed ashore (working on vessels in the docks etc.,) were allowed to proceed to their daily work, but only after inspection. Vaccinations were carried out daily as contacts continued to dribble back to the hostel via the Pools or as a result of the wireless broadcast. The tracing of contacts was made more difficult by the fact that the only particular entered on the hostel register at the time of registration was the person's name. This resulted in a number of persons of similar surnames being sent back to the hostel by the Pools, who had never been in the hostel. It was suggested to the Manager that in future it would be desirable if the number of the intended resident's "Discharge Book" could be taken and entered into the register against his name, as a means of identification. Despite these drawbacks the majority of the residents in the list were traced and vaccinated. A good example of this occurred in the case of a steward who sailed to New York and back before being traced and vaccinated. Two cases of sickness amongst the resident staff occurred after the 10th March. Both were segregated and examined daily by a doctor, the final diagnosis being influenza. Certain difficulties were experienced in preventing some of the residents from leaving before the 27th March, for instance, the shipwrecked crew of a Greek steamer and a party of Maltese repatriates who were due for repatriation. These difficulties were, however, overcome without serious trouble., (13) A daily parade, inspection and constant supervision continued until the morning of the 27th March when it was considered by the Medical Officer of Health that, since no secondary case had been discovered in the hostel, the period of risk was over. The total number of persons vaccinated during the period 10th/27th March was 220 which comprised merchant seamen passing through the hostel, the resident staff and other persons employed at the hostel, viz., painters, laundrymen etc. One secondary case was reported but this occurred in the hospital to which the original patient had been admitted." (Sgd.) G. DRING. Port Health Inspector, V. MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS. 1. Steps taken for the defection of Rodent Plague The Port Health Authority employs 12 Rodent Officers working in conjunction with and under the guidance of the Sanitary Inspectors. The Rodent Officers' first duty is the examination of such ships in his area as are due for inspection under Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention relative to the granting of Deratisation and Deratisation Exemption Certificates. His second duty is to visit ships arriving in his district, to search for dead rats, paying particular attention to vessels which have arrived for plague infected ports, to visit such vessels during the discharge of cargo and, if possible, obtain specimens of any rats on board for bacteriological examinations, The existence of rodent plague on board should thus be detected at the earliest possible moment. The Rodent Officers third duty is the examination of shore premises for signs of rat infestation or rat plague, paying particular attention to premises adjoining the berths of vessels from plague infected ports. Specimens of the shore rat population are regularly examined bacteriologically. In 1941 the Port Health Authority instituted a Rodent Control Scheme in all the docks and premises of the Port of London Authority, on behalf of that Authority, and in the premises of the tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers. This scheme,, in its early days, relied principally on trapping but with experience and the application of a more up-to-date knowledge of the habits of rats, new and scientific methods of poisoning gradually took the place of trapping, the latter now only being used to clear up residual rats, if any, which have escaped a major poison operation, The work done under the Rodent Control Scheme is the subject of separate reports. 2. Measures taken to prevent the passage of rats between ships and shore- (14) The Port of London Authority have made bye-laws requiring the master of every ship to cause all ropes and mooring tackle, to be fitted with guards, to prevent rats from passing from ship to shore. The bye-laws also prescribe that, when the discharge or loading of cargo is not actually proceeding, one gangway, whitened for a length of 10 feet at the end next the vessel, may be used as a communication between the ship and the shore. 3. Methods of Deratisation of- (a) SHIPS. (i) The burning of sulphur at the rate of 3-lbs, per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a period of not less than 6 hours. (ii) The generation of hydrocyanic acid gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a concentration of 0.2 per cent of HCN is required with a minimum exposure of 2 hours. If the fumigation is for the destruction of insect life, bed bugs, cockroaches etc., two or three times the concentration is employed and the exposure increased up to twelve or even twenty-four hours, according to the time available. (iii) Trapping. All vessels from plague infected ports are required to have traps set on board in order that specimens may, if possible, be obtained for bacteriological examination. All other vessels, on which there is evidence of rats, but not of such a number as to justify a demand for fumigation, are required to carry out trapping and this may be done, either by private firms approved for the work, or by the staff of the Port Health Authority. (b) PREMISES IN THE VICINITY OF THE DOCKS AND QUAYS. This is now done under the Rodent Control Scheme referred to elsewhere in this Report. 4. Measures taken for the detection of rat prevalence in ships and on shore. Examination by Inspectors and Rodent Officers, as already described. 5. Rat-proofing. (a) To what extent are Docks, Wharves, Warehouses etc., rat-proof ? During the war years nothing was done to render the dock premises ratproof, indeed many of the wharves and warehouses suffered severely from enemy action but when the rebuilding of these premises is possible, every effort will be made to see that the recommendations made before the war are carried into effect. (b) Action taken to extend rat-proofing (i) in Ships (ii) on shore. This action has remained in abeyance during the war period but will be actively pursued as soon as the post-war conditions make this possible. (15) RATS DESTROYED DURING 1946. TABLE E.

BRITISH 5,275 256 363 953 OTHER NATIONS. 1,318 4 27 64 6,593 260 390 1,017 The routine inspection of ships entering the Port to ascertain the hygiene and sanitation of spaces occupied by crows and passengers has continuedto be carried out by the Port Health Inspectors. Table 'J' shows a summarised classification of the nuisances discovered and Appendix V gives details of the types of nuisances dealt with. Defects are dealt with in two ways depending on whether their remedy would require a structural alteration or not. In the latter case direct contact is made with the owners or agents who are requested to remedy or improve minor defects along suggested lines. If the remedy of a defect would require a structural alteration, attention of the Inspectors of the Ministry of Transport is drawn to the matter and it rests with the Ministry to decide whether the owners should be called upon to remedy the defect, having regard to its nature and the amount of work involved. It is satisfactory to record that it is very seldom that owners fail to comply with requests to improve the accommodation and the sanitary condition of their vessels and in no instance has it been necessary to issue an Order. While certain vessels still fall far below modern standards in their accommodation for crews they are, for the most part, old and it will not be long before they will be replaced by modern ships. Ships built during and since the war show a vast improvement in crews accommodation and in many cases leave nothing to be desired save the proper care and maintenance of the accommodation by the crews themselves. It is to be regretted that, despite the powers now given to masters to secure a proper observance of hygiene and cleanliness, crew accommodation is often found in a filthy condition and showinig obvious evidence of neglect. This is more frequently seen in British than in foreign owned vessels and is a reflection on the attitude of certain crews towards their living quarters. Nevertheless, despite these isolated instances, the maintenance of crew accommodation has generally shown a great improvement all round. (17) VII. FOOD INSPECTION. The fact that the Port of London extends over such a large area and that foodstuffs may be landed at almost any point makes it impossible to divide the staff strictly into Food Inspectors and Sanitary Inspectors. There are, however, certain parts of the docks where the nature and quantity of the foodstuffs landed are such (principally imported meat and meat products) that a whole-time Food Inspector is essential, but there are many districts were the food inspection and sanitary inspection must be combined. For this reason every Sanitary Inspector in the Port of London is required to qualify as a Food Inspector and at the present time all Fourteen Inspectors are qualified in both respects. Post-war conditions, the world shortage of foodstuffs and the need for strict control in the distribution of foodstuffs entering the country resulted in the majority of consignments entering on account of the Crown although towards the end of the year it was noticed that certain imports, mainly fruit and canned fish, were arriving to the account of private merchants. The war time policy of salving damaged foodstuffs and the reconditioning where possible to render them fit either for human or animal consumption or for industrial purposes, necessitated a continuance of the close co-operation and collaboration between the Officers of the Ministry of Food and your Officers, as in previous years. The total amount of foodstuffs seized and condemned for human consumption and either reconditioned or disposed of for animal consumption or for industrial purposes under guarantee or destroyed was 630 tons as compared with 720 tons in 1945 and 1,238 tons in 1944. The following is a summary showing the method of disposal of the foodstuffs seized Method of Disposal. Weight. Approximate percentage of total Tons. cwts. qrs. lbs. Cattle Food 170 18 2 24 27.13 Boiling Down 115 0 0 26 18. 25 Refining 33 12 1 6 5.33 Reconditioning 3 5 3 5 0.52 Industrial Purposes 31 14 0 8 5.03 Buried 267 0 1 26 42.38 Burnt 8 7 1 21 1.33 TOTAL 629 19 0 4 99.97 It will be noted that the percentage buried (42.38) shows a big increase over that of last year (4.44). This is accounted for by the large quantities of oranges, lemons and onions which arrived in a 'wasting' condition and could not be utilized in any way. Your Medical officer considers it necessary to call attention to the marked deterioration that he and your Inspectors have noticed in the quality of certain types of foodstuffs entering the port, particularly meat and meat products. Before the war this country could afford only to purchase the very best quality and to reject meat, and also other foodstuffs, which were unsound, unwholesome or unfit for human consumption. (18) The present- conditions of world food shortage and the economic state of the country has resulted in the importation during the post-war years of certain types of foodstuffs which would have been unhesitatingly condemned before the war. large quantities of boneless beef and mutton, much of it of very poor quality, are now being imported and great difficulty is experienced in examining this material for evidence of disease. Furthermore quantities of 'scrap' meat which, under the Imported Food Regulations, 1937 is 'prohibited meat', whether it be sound or unsound, has had to be accepted failing definite directives by the Ministry of Health. It is, of course, quite impossible to ascertain the origin of this meat, i.e., from what part of the carcase it is derived, and reliance has to be placed on the inspection of the animal ante- and post-mortem at the time of slaughter abroad. Port Medical officers are thus placed in a very invidious position which is not helped by the fact that they have been unable to obtain any guidance from the Ministry of Health in the action they should take in regard to this unsatisfactory material. What is particularly required is a series of standards underlying the acceptance or rejection of imported foodstuffs, common to all ports receiving foodstuffs from abroad. DANGEROUS DRUGS. During the year nineteen Certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No. 3) Regulations, 1923, amending the Dangerous Drugs Regulations, 1921, regulation 15 of which is as follows:- "If a foreign ship in any port in Great Britain requires to obtain a supply of any of the drugs in order to complete the necessary equipment of the ship, the Master of the ship is authorised to purchase and be in possession of such quantity of any of the drugs as may be certified by the Medical Officer of Health of the Port where the ship is (or in his absence by the Assistant Medical officer of Health) to be necessary for the purpose, the quantity not to exceed what is required for the use of the ship until it next reaches its home port. The certificate given by the Medical Officer or Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port shall be marked by the supplier with the date of the supply, and shall be retained by him and kept available for inspection" . PUBLIC HEATH ACT, 1936 . PART X - CANAL BOATS. On the 16th January, 1947, the Port Medical Officer made a report on the steps taken to carry into effect the provisions of part X of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to Canal Boats within the district of the Port of London Health Authority, during the year ended 31st December, 1946. During the year eleven inspections of Canal Boats were made, all of which were found to conform to the Acts and Regulations. No new boats were registered during the year under review, the actual number of Canal Boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1946 being 216. PARROTS (PROHIBITION OF IMPORT)REGULATIONS, 1930.
