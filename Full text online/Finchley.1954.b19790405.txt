Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, This Annual Report on the health of the Borough is a record of work carried out under the direction of Dr. A. A. Turner, M.C., D.P.H., who was Medical Officer of Health for Finchley during the year 1954. The compilation of the Report has been completed since I succeeded Dr. Turner in June 1955 and in the circumstances it is not possible to comment on the details of administration or procedure during the year. On reviewing the statistics presented in the Report certain interesting facts are apparent. The death rate of 10.7 per thousand of the population is the lowest recorded in the Borough for many years. It is encouraging to see that the case rate for tuberculosis of 7.85 per ten thousand population and the death rate from tuberculosis of 0.86 per ten thousand population are both the lowest rates ever recorded in Finchley. Five years ago the records show that the case rate was 11.65 per ten thousand population and the death rate 3.19 per ten thousand population. It is significant to note that while the death rate has dropped quickly the case rate has not improved to anything like the same extent. Indeed in 1929 the case rate was 9.12 which is not greatly different from that of 1954. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act which came into operation on the 30th August 1954 allows owners to increase the rent of controlled property on condition the house is in good repair and suitable for occupation. The tenant can protect himself against an increase in rent by obtaining a Certificate of Disrepair from the Council. These certificates are obtained by application to the Public Health Department and are issued only if the premises are not in good repair or are not fit for occupation having regard to the following:— i Stability ii Freedom from damp iii Natural lighting 3 iv Ventilation v Water supply vi Drainage and sanitary conveniences vii Facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of water. It is surprising to see that only eight applications were made for the issue of Certificates of Disrepair under the provisions of the Act. The resumption of private slaughtering and the supervision of the slaughterhouses placed an obligation on the Council to carry out the inspection of meat. As mentioned in the body of the Report, whereas only one visit to slaughterhouses was made in 1953, 309 visits were made in 1954. This work was done by the Sanitary Inspectors and the appointment of an extra Inspector enabled the increased volume of work to be dealt with. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. W. HAY, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,478 Population, 1954 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,030 Number of Inhabited Houses (1954) 19,755 Rateable Value (1954) £951,830 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,904 Total Live Births 877 Birth Rate per 1,000 home population 12.5 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 15.2 Total Stillbirths 17 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live and still) births 19.0 Total Deaths 747 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 home population 10.7 Standardised Death Rate 9.5 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England and Wales) 11.3 Infant Deaths 16 Infant Mortality Rate 18.2 Infant Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 25.5 Neo-Natal Deaths 13 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate 14.8 Maternal Deaths 1 Maternal Mortality Rate 1.12 Maternal Mortality Rate (England and Wales) 0.69 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 468 377 845 Illegitimate 17 15 32 485 392 877 Birth rate 12.5 per 1,000 estimated home population.

This most satisfactory state can only be maintained if parents ensure that their children are immunised. During the year 40 children were immunised by General Practitioners and 52 by Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. In addition, 695 children were immunised with a combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Three hundred and seventy-six children were given "booster" doses of diphtheria prophylactic alone, and 116 children were given "booster" doses of combined diphtheria and whooping cough prophylactic. Scarlet Fever There were 68 cases of Scarlet Fever, one less than in the previous year. The known cases were mild in character and there is little doubt that in a number of others the illness was so slight as to escape detection altogether. There were no deaths. Poliomyelitis There was one case of Poliomyelitis which occurred in October. Acute polioencephalitis was diagnosed. The patient, a girl aged 2\ years, died before admission to hospital. 16 INCIDENCE OF DIPHTHERIA SINCE 1925 The Council have continued to grant to the North London Branch of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship the use of the Squires Lane Bath on alternate Sundays for "old" cases of Poliomyelitis. The cases are collected from a wide area by ambulances and cars and they are assisted in changing and also in the water by voluntary helpers. All cases are certified by a doctor to be free from infection. Measles The number of notifications was only 99 compared with 857 in 1953. This is the lowest number recorded in the Borough since 1944. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough The notifications numbered 91 in 1954 which is the lowest figure for five years. There were no deaths . During the year, 15 children were immunised by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority. Pneumonia Thirty-eight cases were notified in 1954 and there, were 22 deaths, 15 of which were persons of 65 years of age and over. Malaria No case of Malaria was notified in 1954. Puerperal Pyrexia The total number of cases notified during the year was 31 all of which occurred at the North Midddlesex Hospital Annexe in The Bishop's Avenue. Miscellaneous The following cases were also notified: Dysentery 5 Erysipelas 5 Paratyphoid B 1 Vaccination against Smallpox The number of persons vaccinated for the first time by General Practitioners and Medical Officers of the Local Health Authority was five hundred and eighty-five. Three hundred and two persons were re-vaccinated. 19 Bacteriological Work The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens examined at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, during 1954. Positive Negative Throat/Nose Swabs: Diphtheria Bacilli - Haemolytic Streptococci 34} 147 Vincent's Angina - Faeces: Sonne Dysentery 3 Salmonella 6 } 93 Protozoa - Sputum: T.B. Smear 1} Other Organisms 2 59 Whooping Cough: - Cough Plate -} Post-nasal Swab 10 46 309 Tuberculosis Six persons died from tuberculosis during 1954, giving a death rate of 0.086 per 1,000 population. This is the lowest rate ever recorded. The number of new cases of the disease is the lowest recorded since 1936. The case rate per 10,000 population was 7.85, the lowest recorded. Last year 3 children of school age, and one under school age were found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs—7.7% of the total cases at all ages. Close co-operation between the Public Health Department, the Area Health Department and the Chest Clinic in the constant search for possible sources of infection in new cases of tuberculosis continues. 20 21/22 TUBERCULOSIS (ALL FORMS) The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years: Year New Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 — 1948 37 26 4 5 5 7 3 2 1949 41 37 2 4 10 8 1 4 1950 37 21 2 7 9 5 2 — 1951 37 30 2 6 6 10 1 2 1952 43 21 4 6 15 2 — — 1953 29 33 1 2 7 | 4 — — 1954 29 23 1 2 2 4 ~ - Medical Examinations Twenty-six persons were examined on appointment to the Council's staff and 22 workmen were examined with a view to their admission to the Council's Sickness Pay Scheme. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47 Several cases were brought to the notice of the Department of persons who were living in insanitary surroundings and who were not receiving proper care and attention. In each case it was possible to make satisfactory arrangements for these persons without having to resort to compulsory removal to suitable premises under the provisions of the above section. (b) Section 50 Three burials were carried out by the Council under the provisions of this Section. 23 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are particulars of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1954: Housing Statistics 1. Inspection of Dwelling-houses: (1) (a) Total number of dwelling-houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 1,703 (b) Number of inspections made for the pupose 5,305 (2) (a) Number of dwelling-houses (included under sub-head (1) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 — (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose — (3) Number of dwelling-houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 38 (4) Number of dwelling-houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 632 2. Remedy of defects during the year without service of formal notices: Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action 418 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year: A. Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs 3 (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices: (a) By owners 3 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 2 24 B. Proceedings under Public Health Acts: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 17 (2) Number rendered fit: (a) By owners ... ... ... ... 14 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners ... ... ... ... — C. Proceedings under Sections 11 and 13 of the Housing Act, 1936: (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made ... — (2) Number of dwelling-houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders ... ... — Houses Unfit for Human Habitation 10, Station Road, N.3. An appeal by the owners against the Council's decision to make a Demolition Order was heard at the County Court, the Judge deferring his findings for three months to enable the owners and the Local Authority to discuss the possibility of the sale of the house with a view to the necessary repairs being carried out to render the house fit. Arising thereon it was agreed that the Council themselves should purchase the property and at the end of the year negotiations were proceeding accordingly. 3, Gruneisen Road, N.3. The owner of the above house, which had been represented to the Council the previous year as unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost, failed to give a satisfactory undertaking and a Closing Order was served upon him. 277, Ballards Lane, N.12. The above house was found to be unfit and incapable of repair at reasonable cost and was represented to the Council with a view to making a Demolition Order. 25 Slum Clearance At the beginning of the year a circular was received from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government pointing out to Local Authorities that steps should be taken to review housing conditions in their areas and to resume as a matter of urgency the campaign of slum clearance which the war had interrupted. In anticipation of the Housing Repairs and Rents Acts which came into operation on the 30th August 1954 and imposes a duty upon the Local Authority to make a survey of the unfit houses in their area and submit to the Minister within one year their proposals for dealing with these houses, a survey was commenced and the following Clearance Areas reported to the Council and submitted to the Minister for confirmation: 1. 411, 413 and 415, Long Lane, N.2. 2. 27, 29, 31 and 33, Market Place, N.2. la, Prospect Place, 1, 2, 3 and 4, Galpins Cottages, Prospect Place and Nos. 1-17 (inclusive) Prospect Place, N.2. 3. 1118, 1120, 1122 and 1124, High Road, N.20. 4. 11, 13, 15 and 17, Swan Lane, N.20. Total: 37 houses. With regard to areas Nos. 2, 3 and 4, it was resolved that application be made to the Minister for Compulsory Purchase Orders and at the end of the year confrmation was being awaited. During the year a film called "The Stockton Test", produced by the Allied Ironfounders, Ltd., was shown to members of the Council. The film dealt with the adaptation of sub-standard property to comply with modern requirements for the purposes of grant, as set out in the Housing Act, 1949. A course of ten lectures on housing, arranged by the Sanitary Inspectors' Association, was held in London during the winter evenings, and was attended by the Sanitary Inspectors. Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Repairs Increase and Certificates of Disrepair. The above Act, which came into force on the 30th August, 1954, imposed a duty upon local authorities to issue Certificates of 26 Disrepair where the landlord claimed a repairs increase in rent and the tenant felt that the house was not in good repair and was not reasonably fit for occupation. A charge of one shilling is made for a certificate, or for the revocation thereof. Preparations were made to deal with a flood of applications when the appointed day arrived, and it is interesting to note in the following table the particulars of applications received during the four remaining months of the year covered by this report:— Applications received 9 Certificates granted 3 Applications under consideration at end of year 3 Certificates refused 2 Applications withdrawn 1 From the foregoing figures it will be seen that few applications were received, and it is difficult to assess exactly the reason. Many owners did not comply with the conditions set out in the Act to justify an increase of rent, stating that the amount was insufficient to meet the cost of repairs. Others, however, availed themselves of the provisions to increase the rent by two-thirds of the statutory allowance where the tenant undertook to carry out internal decorative repairs. Inspections The total number of inspections made during the year was 13,980. At 668 of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 1,784 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,383 including a number outstanding at the end of 1953 had been remedied or abated. The work in connection with 109 was in hand and 1,384 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied 941 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded below, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out: Inspections under Housing Acts 224 Special Inspections 3,233 Reinspections 2,661 27 Inspections of Works in Progress 941 Inspections of Factories and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 451 Visits to Slaughterhouses 309 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 25 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 102 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops 493 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 327 Visits re Infectious Disease and Vermin 526 Visits re Rodent Control 3,934 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 163 Visits re Hawkers 57 Visits to Hairdressers' Premises 34 Visits to Houses Let in Lodgings 12 Visits re Pet Animals Act, 1951 7 Visits re Heating Appliances—Fireguards 31 Miscellaneous 450 13,980 Summary of Sanitary Improvements carried out Drainage Premises redrained 9 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 87 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 252 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 329 Length in yards of iron drains laid 59 Manholes provided 30 Manholes repaired 8 Manhole covers provided 42 Intercepting trap fixed 1 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 17 New gully traps fixed 49 Gully curbs provided or repaired 29 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 13 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 5 Water tests applied 187 28 Smoke tests applied 64 Air tests applied 10 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C.

The necessary searches were made and the required information furnished. Disinfection and Disinfestation Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 113. Number of articles disinfected 941 Number of verminous premises dealt with 11 Verminous rooms disinfested 42 Five hundred and twenty six visits were made by inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. There was a decrease in the number of premises infested with bugs, 3 cases having been dealt with, compared with 14 in 1953. 30 The following is a summary of disinfestation work carried out during the year: Premises Bugs 3 Fleas 3 Cockroaches 2 Beetles 3 Ants 1 Wasps 69 Bees 1 Moths 5 Miscellaneous 2 The number of verminous rooms which were dealt with was 42 compared with 52 in 1953. Sanitary Conveniences There are 24 conveniences attached to public houses within the Borough. These premises are inspected periodically. There are now 14 public conveniences in the Borough, including those in recreation grounds. Thirteen of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and one for males only. Complaints One thousand four hundred and eighteen complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz: Absence of, or defective condition of, dustbins 15 Accumulations of refuse and manure 26 Blocked or defective drains 207 Defective roofs 66 Defective W.Cs. 47 Dirty milk bottles 1 Flooding 10 Foreign matter in food 4 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 259 Noise 5 Non-removal of refuse 7 31 Nuisances from dampness 63 Nuisances from the burning of refuse 7 Nuisances from the keeping of animals or poultry 4 Premises infested with insects 50 Premises infested with rats or mice 403 Shops Act 3 Smells from Public Sewers 8 Smoke nuisances 15 Unsatisfactory Housing Conditions, including Overcrowding 32 Unsound food 16 Verminous condition of houses 6 Wasps' nests 69 Water supply 16 Other complaints 79 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint. Places of Public Entertainment The cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied after notice had been given to the persons responsible. Eighteen premises were inspected and a report was submitted to the Middlesex County Council which is the licensing authority. 32 Factories Acts, 1937-1948 1.

(4) Education Activities: Lectures to classes of senior school children were arranged at four schools. Talks were given by the Sanitary Inspectors, after which films were shown and discussed. The lectures were attended by some 120 children. In addition, one lecture on food hygiene was given by a Sanitary Inspector, to a class of volunteers in connection with Civil Defence Welfare Section Training. (5) Method of Disposal of Condemned Food: Condemned food is removed by the Public Health Department's van and is destroyed at the Council's Refuse Destructor. Inspection of Meat and Food The inspection of food and premises where food is prepared continued to receive special attention. Two new registrations of hawkers were gramed during the year. Before registration is granted the Council insist upon satisfactory storage accommodation being provided and this is checked where necessary with the Local Authority concerned. Following such an investigation, one application for registration was refused because of unsatisfactory storage accommodation, but was granted at a later date upon satisfactory storage arrangements being made. The number of barrow boys operating in the district at the end of the year was 4. 38 Slaughterhouses With the abolition of meat rationing and the decontrol of meat and livestock which took place at the end of June, the slaughter of meat for human consumption at government controlled central slaughterhouses ceased. The Government announced its intention to bring about what is called "moderate concentration of slaughtering facilities throughout the country", but stated that "this long-term policy will take some years to apply and the immediate problem will be to ensure that sufficient slaughtering facilities will be available when the Ministry's control of slaughtering comes to an end in July next. To achieve this it will be essential that very many private slaughterhouses shall be brought into use". So the abolition of private slaughterhouses and the building of properly constructed and controlled abbatoirs have faded once again into a dream of things to come. As directed by the Minister of Food, a review of the slaughtering requirements for the district was carried out, and, arising therefrom, applications for licences for two slaughterhouses were received. These were considered by the Council, and after works of repair and improvement had been carried out, licences were granted to the occupiers. It is interesting to note that although the local butchers' organisation was approached with a view to the larger of the two slaughterhouses being used by local traders, this was not taken advantage of, and was in fact used by a firm outside the district for slaughter for the wholesale trade, chiefly at Smithfield. The coming into use of these slaughterhouses entailed a large amount of additional work by the Sanitary Inspectors, both during the evenings and at week-ends, as will be seen from the table showing the numbers of animals slaughtered and the amount of meat condemned for that part of the year, as compared with the previous year. In 1953 one visit was made to slaughterhouses, as against 309 in the period under review. 39 Carcases Inspected and Condemned Cattle excluding cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed 508 351 1,815 5,046 623 Number inspected 508 351 1,815 5,046 623 All diseases except Tuberculosis : Whole carcases condemned - - 2 8 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 91 103 4 482 34 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis 17.91 29.34 0.33 9.71 5.46 Tuberculosis only : Whole carcases condemned - 5 - 1 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 33 111 4 - 9 Percentage of the number inspected affected with tuberculosis 6.50 33.05 0.22 0.02 1.44 40 UNSOUND FOOD CONDEMNED, 1954 Tuberculosis Cattle Carcases 5 Forequarter 1 Heads 51 Hearts 3 Livers 22 Lungs 85 sets Mesenteries 16 Plucks 10 Spleens 2 Calves Livers 2 Plucks 2 Pigs Heads 4 Lungs 1 set Mesenteries 4 Sheep & Lambs Carcase 1 Other Diseases Cattle Heads 2 (Abscess 1, Actinomycosis 1) Hearts 2 (Pericarditis) Kidneys 2 (Abscess1, Nephritis 1) Livers 165½ (Abscess 29½, Cavernous Angioma 12, Cirrhosis 13, Degenerated Cysts 2, Fatty Infiltration 1, Flukes 105, Melanosis 3) Lungs 6 sets (Abscess 4, Pleurisy 2) Mesentery 1 (Abscess) Part Fore quarter 1 (Abscess in Prescapular Gland) Spleens 3 (Inflammation) 41 Calves Carcases 2 (Moribund 1, Pyaemia 1) Livers 3 (Abscess 1, Fatty 1, Parasitic 1) Pluck 1 (Abscess) Pigs Hearts 8 (Pericarditis 7, Pleurisy 1) Livers 11 (Cirrhosis 9, Fibroma 1, Hepatitis 1) Lungs 22 sets (Congestion 4, Parasitic 1, Pleurisy 2, Pneumonia 15) Sheep & Lambs Carcases 8 (Emaciation 2, Moribund 6) Hearts 2 (Abscess 1, Pericarditis 1) Leg 1 (Trauma and Abscess) Livers 364 (Abscess 2, Degenerated Cysts 70, Echinococcus Cysts 1, Flukes 160, Parasitic 130, Tenuicollis Cysts 1) Lungs 91 sets (Abscess 3, Congestion 1, Degenerated Cysts 3, Parasitic 6, Pleurisy 3, Pneumonia 24, Strongylosis 51) Omenta 2 (Tenuicollis Cysts) Plucks 29 (Parasitic 27, Strongylosis 2) Shoulder & Neck 1 (Trauma) Unsound Cattle Beef 2,401 ¾lbs.

It appeared that whilst on the ship, water had reached the tins and a chemical reaction had taken place with the gum used for affixing the labels, with the result that a proportion of the tins had become perforated with minute holes. The Ministry of Food had forbidden the sale of the salmon direct to the retail trade but had agreed to its being released for processing purposes subject to its first being examined and passed by the local Sanitary Officers. A consignment of 1,400 cases comprising 67,200 tins had been allocated to Finchley, and all were examined by your Sanitary Inspectors. Three thousand eight hundred and ninety-three tins were found to be unsound. This figure is included in the tabulated list of tinned food above. Humane Slaughter of Animals In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933, all animals, including sheep, slaughtered in a 45 house within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in good repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. Licensed Slaughtermen The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by the local authority. The licences granted by the Council have to be renewed annually. Three persons were licensed during 1954. Butchers' Shops There are 46 butchers' shops in the Borough. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. A new cold store was constructed in one shop. All these premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat, the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have generally been well observed. Bakehouses The number of bakehouses in the Borough is 23. At 22 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by the inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical cleansing of these premises, as required by statute, has generally been carried out. At one large bakehouse the floor was completely relaid with tiles and a new tray-washing machine was installed. Two bakehouses were closed during the year. The one underground bakehouse in the district was inspected in accordance with Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, and found to be satisfactory. It was reported to the Council and the necessary certificate was granted. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops There are 9 registered premises within the district, and all have been inspected from time to time. 46 Milk (Special Designations) Regulations Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1954, as follows: Dealers' Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 18 „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 17 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 21 Supplementary Licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 7 „ „ „ „ „ „ Pasteurised 8 „ „ „ „ Sterilised 8 Five samples of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) milk, four samples of Pasteurised and ten samples of Sterilised were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. All these samples complied with the prescribed conditions. Food Sampling The following information has been furnished by the Middlesex County Council Public Control Department relative to samples taken in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938: List of samples procured in the Borough during the year: Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk 17 — Milk, new 238 20 Acetic acid 2 — Baking powder 1 — Butter 10 — Cakes 33 — Cheese 2 — Chocolate powder 1 — Coffee 1 - Condensed Tomatoes 1 — Cooked Meats 12 — Cream 11 - Dried Fruit 1 47 Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Drugs 8 - Fish 16 - Fruit Drinks 2 —- Fruit Sauce 1 — Grapes 1 — Ground Almonds 1 — Jam 1 — Lemons 1 — Liver 5 — Margarine 5 — Marzipan 1 — Meat 1 — Meat Pie 5 — Mincemeat 1 — Non-brewed Condiment 1 — Oranges 3 — Salad Cream 1 — Sausages 28 — Soups 3 — Suet 1 — Sweets 1 — Tea 2 1 Trifle 1 — Vinegar 24 2 Wines and Spirits 3 — Totals 447 23 With regard to the twenty-three samples noted as unsatisfactory, the following brief comments may be of interest. Milk, new. These twenty unsatisfactory samples were procured in all from seven farmers. Six samples from one farmer were all deficient in solids-not-fat, but the presence of added water was not confirmed. A further case of five samples proved to be deficient in fat, and two further cases, each of three samples, also 48 were found to be deficient in fat. The remaining three samples, from separate farmers, were also deficient in fat. In all seven cases associated and subsequent follow-up samples were found to be genuine, and apart from advising the farmers no Lurther action was taken. Tea. This was a packet of tea, purchased privately, and brought in for analysis. It contained a paludrine tablet. A letter of warning was sent to the packers. Vinegar. Two samples of vinegar, from the same retailer, were found to be non-brewed condiment. Proceedings were instituted and the retailer was fined £3-0-0, and ordered to pay £3-17-0 costs. Merchandise Marks Act, 1926—Imported Food Orders. During the year 107 premises were visited and 368 displays of meat, apples, tomatoes, poultry, dried fruit, butter and eggs were examined. No infringements of substance arose. Labelling of Food Order, 1953. One hundred and thirty premises were visited and 1,209 different articles examined. No infringements of substance arose. Special Designated Milk. For the year 1954 my Council issued licences in respect of one firm of Dealers/Sterilisers; and in the case of another firm of both Dealers/Sterilisers and Dealers/Pasteurisers. The premises were regularly inspected throughout the year and in all 121 samples of sterilised and pasteurised milk were taken and submitted to examination. All samples proved satisfactory. Milk Samples for T.B. Examination. In addition to the foregoing 9 samples of new milk were taken for bacteriological examination; none was adversely reported upon. Ice Cream Premises The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1947, control the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. Only one person makes ice cream within the Borough, and employs the method known as "complete cold mix" which only requires the addition of water. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the Borough. 49 There are 157 premises registered for the sale of ice cream. Twenty-four samples were taken during the year. Coffee Stalls At the end of the year there was only one remaining in the district, one coffee stall having been removed. Fish Friers There were eight premises in the district where the business of fish frying was carried out. Game Licences Twenty-one applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the Borough for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. Shops Act 1950 Inspection of shops in the Borough has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. In one instance two new W.C. apartments were built, providing accommodation for males and females. Proceedings were taken with regard to Sunday Trading in respect of the sale of second-hand cars. Further particulars of the case will be found under the heading "Legal Proceedings". Particulars in regard to shops on the Register are as follows: Number on Register at beginning of 1954 926 Number closed 16 New shops 30 Number on Register at end of 1954 940 Changes of occupancy 37 The number of persons observing the Jewish Sabbath and registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 of the Act was ten. Water Supply During the year the water supply of the Borough has been satisfactory in quality and in quantity. The bulk of the water is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company and copies of reports on 12 samples which were taken by the Company during 50 the year and submitted for bacteriological examination to the Counties Public Health Laboratory were forwarded to me. In all cases the results were satisfactory. All dwelling-houses in the Borough are supplied with water from public water mains direct to the houses with the exception of 4 houses serving a population of 10 which are served by standpipes. Pollution of Streams and Watercourses Further investigations have been carried out regarding the pollution of streams in and adjoining the district and in connection therewith, a serious case of oil pollution was traced to a factory, and satisfactory measures were taken to deal with the nuisance. Smoke Abatement The factory chimneys in the area have been kept under observation and generally little nuisance from smoke or grit has occurred. Complaints were received with regard to the emission of grit from the chimney of a central heating plant of a large block of flats, and upon advice being given regarding the type of fuel to be used and the more frequent cleansing of the flues, the nuisance ceased. Pamphlets containing the imporant references in the Ridley Report relating to Domestic and Industrial Smoke Prevention were distributed to various organisations and industrial users in the Borough. A special course of lectures was held at the Northampton Polytechnic, London, for the instruction of stokers. The proprietors of the various industrial premises in the district were interviewed, and arising therefrom, a number of stokers attended the course, facilities and expenses being provided by the firms concerned. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There is only one trader whose premises come within the definition of the Act and are registered. Pet Animals Act, 1951 There were two new registrations under the above Act during 1954, making the total number of persons registered in the district 6. All the premises have been inspected. 51 Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 Thirty-one visits have been made to premises to ascertain: that the provisions of the Act were being complied with. In two shops a number of electric fires were found which did not comply with the Act. These were withdrawn from sale and warnings were issued to the proprietors. Burial Act, 1857 Licences for the removal of human remains under the above Act state, inter alia, "It is considered advisable that the Medical Officer of Health should be notified whenever such a licence is granted in order that he may be in a position to take (under his general powers) any action that may appear to him to be necessary in the interests of public health". Three copies of licences for such removals were received from the Home Office during the year. The exhumations were carried out in the early hours of the morning and were visited when necessary by one of the sanitary inspectors, in order to ascertain that the conditions of the licences were complied with. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances: (i) Proceedings were instituted against a second-hand car dealer for failure to close his premises for the serving of customers, on a Sunday, in contravention of the Shops Act, 1950. The; defendant was convicted of the offence and was granted an absolute discharge on the payment of £5-5-0 costs. (ii) A firm of bakers was summoned with regard to a cigarette end found in a currant bun. A fine of £10-0-0 was imposed and an order to pay £3-3-0 costs was made. 52 RODENT CONTROL Complaints and Infestations Premises from which complaints have been received Premises where infestation was confirmed Premises where infestation was not confirmed 15 mths to 31.3.54 1954/55 15 mths to 31.3.54 1954/55 15 mths to 31.3.54 1954/55 Rats 345 278 258 185 87 98 Mice 173 125 160 102 13 18 Total 518 403 418 287 100 116 The number of complaints has remained about the same average as the previous twelve months but the number of confirmed infestations has decreased slightly. Arising from these complaints, 49 additional premises werefound to be infested with rats and 10 infested with mice. Fifty-three premises, where poultry were kept, were found tobe infested with rats. This figure represents 22.64% of the infestations. 53 Summary of Work carried out from 1.4.1954—31.3.1955 Rats Mice Visits in connection with infestations 3112 822 Number of confirmed infestations 234 112 Prebaits . 202 — Zinc Phosphide P O I S 0 N 90 — Arsenic 13 Red Squill A.N.T.U — — Warfarin / 2225 1065 There was an increase of smoke tests on rat runs which revealed defects in sewers or drains on 26 occasions. These have been remedied. The continued use of Warfarin is still producing satisfactory results.
