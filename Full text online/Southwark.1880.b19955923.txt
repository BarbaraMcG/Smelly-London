Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY DAY, 1881. Me. Chairman and Gentlemen, 1 have much pleasure in presenting to you my second Annual Report, ending March 25th, No question can possibly be more interesting. than the means of preserving Health ; and if it were possible to lay down a few golden rules suitable for all ages and conditions of men, there is little doubt they would be zealously learned and followed. There are however some general rules which all can follow with benefit, such as the use of fresh air, cleanliness, proper diet, and regular exercise. During the year 2,223 children were born and registered in this Parish. Of these 1,127 were males, and 1,096 females. The Deaths were, of males 654, females, 602, giving a total of 1,256. The Deaths of males exceeding that of females by 52. The Births were 38 less than that of the previous year, and were 967 in excess of the Deaths. The Deaths were 69 below the average of the last ten years. According to the return of the last census, the population of the Parish has increased by 2,535, but while the Kent Road district has increased by 921, and the London Road by 2,351, the Borough Road has decreased by 554. This is to be accounted for, by the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1880—81. 11 closing of the Queen's Bench Prison, and by the Metropolitan Board of Works having closed many of the houses in the Green Street area, and also in the Mint; and I trust it will not be long before these areas are completely demolished, and decent houses erected in their place, but not Industrial dwellings. The Death rate therefore has been 22—2, which is the same as that given by the Registrar General for the whole of London; so that I think we can compare] favourably with the neighbouring Parishes. The Death rate in the first quarter of the year for the whole of London was 21—8. So low a Death rate in a corresponding quarter has not been recorded since 1856. This is the more remarkable on account of the exceptionally severe frosts that prevailed during the greater part of January, and also an exceptionally heavy fall of snow. We have a right to infer that this low death rate is in some measure due to the sanitary efforts of the last few years, especially so when it is borne in mind that the natural tendency of any large Parish if left to itself is not to become healthier, but to deteriorate, owing to the increasing density of its population, and the consequent increasing pollution of the air; and we cannot help looking with anxiety as to the result of massing a large number of human beings in the huge buildings which are being built near us.

The Deaths in the three Sub-districts are shown in the accompanying Table, the Kent Road District being the highest. TABLE No. 3. SUB-DISTRICTS. POPULATION IK 1871. POPULATION IN 1881.

This is due to Infantile Diarrhoea, which was very high, owing to a high temperature. In the other quarters the Deaths from this cause only amounted to eighteen, the whole stress of this summer epidemic was therefore confined to the three months referred to, as will be seen in the following Table.

In the presence of such an epidemic I cannot but regard the practice of Re-vaccination as one of the most important sanitary measures to which we can have recourse, but unfortunately there still exist objections 14 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwark. which I believe to be entirely groundless, I mean the effect of Lymph as at present used, but this might be overcome could a constant supply of Vaccine be obtained direct from the calf, although statistics lead us to believe that the same amount of protection is not gained from animal as from humanized lymph. With regard to Revaccination it cannot be too often pointed out, that no revaccinated attendant at any of the Small-pox Hospitals has ever contracted the disease. TABLE No. 7. 1880-81.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1880 — 81. 15 Scarlet Fever may be said to indicate little more by its prevalence than the existence perhaps of overcrowding, but the deaths from this cause during the past year were 31 less than that of the former.

Of those who died 735 were under one year, 89 under twenty, and 472 from twenty to eighty. Ninety Inquests have been held during the year. Fifty-five bodies have been taken to the Mortuary since the 29th of July last, and I hope we may soon have a Coroner's Court attached to it, and that the Coroner may see fit to direct that all bodies upon whom Inquests are to be held should be removed there. The following numbers will I trust show that the erection of Closets attached to the Urinal in St. George's Road has been attended with success, and I am glad that the Vestry intend increasing them; but I should like the experiment tried of opening some for the use of females, to whom I think it would be a great boon.

With regard to the water supply, 1 professor Frankland reports that during the year 1880, the organic impurities have been larger than any year since 1872, owing to the flooded state of the rivers, so that with all the storage at their command it seems impossible for the companies to supply water fit for dietetic purposes. During the first three quarters of the year there was no marked deviation from the usual temperature of the several months, except in September, when on the 4th the thermometer registered 79°.0; but the last quarter was distinguished by an extraordinary low temperature, and exceptional falls] of snow. On the 21st of January the thermometer at Blackheath was 9°.2, and the depth of snow in some parts of the country measured 33 inches; and a correspondent from Bournemouth says, "Rooks were seen to kill and oat sparrows, and blackbirds to eat each other on my lawn, where a great congregation of birds were collected." The duties of the Inspectors, under the Sanitary Act, necessarily bring them into contact with infectious diseases, and much of their time is taken up in removing infectious cases, and superintending the disinfection of the houses, articles of clothing, and bedding, where they have occurred; and there is great credit due to them for the manner in which they have performed their unpleasant duties. The several articles below have been disinfected. 1880 and 1881. LIST OF BEDDING DISINFECTED IN THE APPARATUS.

The undermentioned Works have been executed in this Department during the Year ending 25th March, 1881. GAS. The Gas Testing Meters fixed at St. George's Circus and Elliott's Row to test the quantity of Gas consumed, give the following results, viz:— South Metropolitan Gas Company, 5.28 cubic feet per hour. London Gas Company, 4 88 cubic feet per hour. The Lamps of the South Metropolitan Gas Company consume 6 cubic feet more Gas each per night than the Lamps of the London Gas Company. TREES. With reference to the failure of many of the Trees, the Gardener employed to plant the last number this year, reports that the cause of their death was the fact that too great a quantity of water had reached the roots, in consequence of the loam in the holes being kept below the level of the footways, which in wide footways would cause an abnormally large quantity of water to reach the roots. The system first adopted in planting the Trees, was to heap the loam round the Trees above the level of the footpaving, but this was condemned as improper. Trees planted in public streets in place of dead ones 185 j WORKS EXECUTED. PAVING, New York laid in footways 940 square yards. Grindlay's Patent Granite Aspbalte laid in Footways— Blackman Street, Angel Place and Falcon Court, 1160 square yards.
