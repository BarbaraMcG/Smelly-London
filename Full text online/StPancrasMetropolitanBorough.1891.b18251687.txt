THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Being the Report for the Year 1801. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith the Thirty-sixth Annual Report upon the vital and sanitary condition of St. Pancras. I.—Introduction. The delay in the issue of the report has arisen from the additional and somewhat exceptional work thrown upon your Health Department due to three causes, namely, the several changes that have taken place in the staff of the Department, the variations in procedure, and the additional powers and functions conferred by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the hurried preparations to resist the threatened invasion of Cholera. The principal points of interest in this Report may be briefly enumerated as:— Statistics of the epidemics of Influenza in the three consecutive years. A brief summary of the outbreak of Enteric Fever at the Foundling Hospital. A short account of the origin and development of the representations made under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as to the Insanitary Areas within the parish. In this connection it will be observed in the statistics that the mortality of Somers Town, compared with other subdistricts, as in previous years, stands highest. Some accounts of the method of dealing with nuisances arising from smoke, and also from sunken manure and ash-pits. The powers and duties of your Vestry in reference to Workshops and Factories. The sampling of milk in transit is discussed in its various bearings. Your attention is also again drawn to the necessity for a temporary shelter for single-room families during disinfection. The table of the meteorology of London during the four quarters and the year 1891 set out below, is followed by the several sections of the Report, enumerated in the contents. 6 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1891.

PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Births.—The number of births occurring in Public Institutions during the ysar was as follows:— Homes of Hope—Gray's Inn Lane Sub-District 40 Workhouse—Camden Town 177 Total 217 Deaths.—The number of deaths of parishioners occurring in Public Institutions during the year was as follows:— In Parochial Institutions 1042 In Extra-Parochial Institutions 478 Total 1520 The number of persons who died in Institutions within the Parish was as follows:— Parishioners 1042 Non-Parishioners 637 Total1679 POPULATION. As stated, and for the reasons given in the Annual Report for the previous year, the population of St. Pancras may be estimated as stationary, the birth-rate, death-rate, and migration rate counterbalancing each other. The population of St. Pancras and Sub-Districts in the middle of 1891, after correction and re-distribution is therefore estimated as follows:— Regent's Park 37471 Tottenham Court 36509 Gray's Inn Lane 28028 Somers Town 33545 Camden Town 14344 Kentish Town 96535 St. Pancras 236132 MARRIAGES. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during the year was 2120, being 22 more than in the preceding year and 46 more than the annual average for the preceding decennium. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in the Parish during the year was 7188, being 189 more than the number of the preceding year, and 353 less than the average for the preceding ten years. 8 The 217 births occurring in Public Institutions having been redistributed, the number of births and the birth-rates in the Sub-Districts were as follows:- Sub-Districts. Number of Births. Birth-rate. Regent's Park 1023 27.3 Tottenham Court 707 26.7 Gray's Inn Lane 831 29.8 Sorters Town 1128 33.6 Camden Town 478 33.3 Kentish Town 3018 31.3 St. Pancras 7188 30.4 London 134003 31.8 DEATHS. During the 52 weeks of the year 1891, the corrected number of deaths from all causes at all ages, of St. Pancras parishioners was 5198, a number higher than in any other year durir.g the preceding decennium, and 402 above the average for the ten years. The corrected death rate per 1000 of population living was 22.0, or 0.2 per 1000 higher than in the preceding year, and 1.7 higher than the average for the preceding decennium. The number of deaths and the death-rates in the Sub-Districts were as follows, 333 deaths from all causes not referable to any particular Sub-Districts being distributed according to population. Sub-Districts. Number of Deaths. -rate.

Tinder one year of age the number of deaths and proportion per 1000 births and per thousand total deaths were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number of Deaths under 1 Year. Per 1000 Births Per 1000 Deaths at all Ages. Regent's Park 160 156.4 203.3 Tottenham Court 129 182.4 214.3 Gray's Inn Lane 125 149.9 195.3 Somers Town 198 175.5 218.5 Camden Town 79 165.3 253.2 Kentish Town 430 142.5 220.4 St. Pancras 1121 156.0 215.7 London 20682 154.3 229.3 Under five years of age the number of Deaths and proportion per 1000 births and per 1000 total deaths were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number of Deaths under 5 Years. Per 1000 Births. Per 10. 0 Deaths at all Ages. Regent's Park 233 227.8 296.0 Tottenham Court 210 297.0 248.8 Gray's Inn Lane 215 257.8 335.9 Somers Town 318 281.9 351.0 Camden Town 111 232.2 355.7 Kentish Town 705 233.6 361.4 St. Pancras 1792 249.3 344.8 London 33340 248.8 3696 10 CAUSES OF DEATH. Zymotic Diseases. The principal Zymotic Diseases were the cause of 522 deaths compared with 646 in the previous year, and an annual average during the previous ten years of 673 1. The number of deaths and the proportions per 1000 of population and per 1000 of total deaths were as follows:— Sub-Districts. Number. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Total Deaths. Regent's Park 90 2.4 114.1 Tottenham 52 2.0 91.4 Grav's Inn Lane 84 3.0 131.2 Somers Town 78 2.3 87.2 Camden Town 27 1.9 86.5 Kentish Town 190 1.9 97.4 St. Pancras 522 2.2 100.4 London 9675 2.3 107.2 During the year no deaths were registered in St. Pancras as due to Small-pox and to Typhus Fever, and only one death to Continued Fever. Enteric Fever caused 27 deaths, the annual average for the preceding ten years having been 534; and Scarlet Fever causcd 32 deaths, the decimal average having been 57.3. Measles was the cause of 69 deaths, against an average of 132.7; Diarrhoea 158, against 181; Whooping Cough 155, against 153.7; and Diptheria 80, against 65 9. The last-mentioned was the only Zymotic Disease materially above the average; but compared with the previous year, when the deaths were 141, there is a considerable fall in its mortality (see Table 5). INFLUENZA. This disease having prevailed in an epidemic form in three consecutive years, 1889-90, 1890-91, 1891-92, it is interesting to place on record the comparative statistics. Taking the four months, December, January, February, and March, during each of the epidemic periods, and comparing their relative mortality, whereas in St. Pancras in the first epidemic the mortality was 41, in the second it was nil, and in the third 161. Similarly, in all London, the mortality was reespectively 559, 38, and 2,164. From these figures it will be seen that the epidemic of 1891-2 was by far the most fatal. 11 London and St. Pancras.—Deaths from Influenza, Respiratory Diseases, and Total Deaths Week ending.

Influenza is a dangerous infectious disease, most probably caused by extremely microscopic parasitic germs, capable of being wafted in the air. The infectious germs may instantly light upon the surface of the eye, or be washed through the tear-duct at the inner corner of the eye into the nose, or be sniffed into the nos9, or pass by the back of the nostrils into the throat, or be iuhaled into the mouth, throat, or lungs. From the time of infection the disease may take from one to seven days to develop, but most frequently not more than two or three, and the sufferer continues to throw off infection for at least a week, and probably longer. An infected person may suffer so slightly from the disease as to be inobservably affected, or so severely as to undergo intense fever, nervous prostration, and death. The contagion is most probably thrown off from an infected person, mainly by the breath and exhalations, and the discharges from the eyes, nose, and mouth; resembling measles, whooping cough, and epidemic pneumonia in this respect. In times of epidemic prevalence of the disease, persons suffering from head-ache, giddiness, pains in back and limbs, languor, suffused eyes, flushed face, and feverishness, should at once seek advice as to the nature of their complaint. 13 Persons pronounced to be suffering from influenza should submit to bo nursed under medical advice and remain secluded in a warm room until recovery. Persons suspected of being infected for, their own safety's sake should studiously avoid exposing themselves to cold and fatigue in the open. For the safety of others, they should avoid breathing or coughing into the face of other persons, and carefully retain all discharges from the mouth, nose, or eyes, in handkerchiefs, clothes, or rags, which should be changed several times a day, and, when soiled, be either cast into water and boiled for half-an-hour, or else burnt. The linen should be well boiled, wearing apparel and furniture stuffs should be well aired,after having been brushed, shaken, or beaten in a close room, and the dust collected and burnt. The interior of rooms should be ventilated without draught, and, in the absence of the sufferer, fully aired. All surfaces of floors, furniture, walls, and ceilings, should be well cleansed, and soap and water should not be spared. Healthy persons, even in the open air, should exercise great care not to inhale the breath of others, especially of those who cough, hawk, or spit. Similar precautions should be exercised in public halls, rooms, vehicles, or other close public structures, resisting crowding together, and insisting upon pure ventilation and cleanliness. The rooms and homes of relatives and friends infected with the disease should be avoided, and kissing and embracing should be dispensed with as much as possible. The general health should be maintained by personal cleanliness, temperate habits, nourishing food, warmth of clothing and dwelling, and by avoiding chills, fatigue, and depressing emotions. Influenza is not a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and therefore, although a dangerous infectious disease, it is not in the power of Sanitary Authorities to apply to it measures of isolation and disinfection. TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The Tubercular Diseases caused 746 deaths, compared with 792 in the preceeding year, the incidence was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Numbers. per 1000 population. per 1000 total deaths. Regent's Park 111 2.9 141.0 Tottenham Court 91 3.4 151.2 Gray's Inn Lane 101 3.6 157.8 Somers Town 139 4.1 153.4 Camden Town 36 2.5 115.4 Kentish Town 268 2.8 137.4 St. Pancras 746 3.4 143.5 London 12258 2.9 135.9 14 RESPIRATORY DISEASES. The Respiratory Diseases which numbered 874 in 1889 rose to 1147 in 1890, and further rose to 1307 in 1891, the incidence was as follows:— Sub-Districts. Numbers. per 1000 population. per 1000 deaths. Regent's Park 175 4.7 222.4 Tottenham Court 144 5.4 239.2 Gray's Inn Lane 180 6.4 281.2 Somers Town 256 7.6 282.6 Camden Town 77 5.4 246.8 Kentish Town 475 4.9 243.4 St. Pancras 1307 5.5 251.4 London 22489 5.3 249.3 VIOLENT DEATHS. Violence was the cause of 200 deaths during 1891, the numbers for 1890 and 1889 being 165 and 177 respectively. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The uncertified deaths registered in St. Pancras were 5 in number, against 9 and 5, respectively, in the two previous years. INQUESTS. During the year 494 inquests were held, of which 477 were conducted in the Coroner's Court. In the previous year the number was 448, of which 422 took place in the Coroner's Court. PUBLIC MORTUARIES. Number of Bodies deposited in the General Mortuary 478 Number of Bodies deposited in the Infectious Mortuary 0 Total 478 15 COMPARATIVE MORTALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. As will be seen from the preceding tables, Somers Town stands out prominently with the highest total mortality, having a death-rate of 5 per 1000 above the district of St. Pancras as a whole. In previous years the same fact has appeared in the statistics Compared to the other Sub-Districts the mortality was highest at every age period. The death-rate from zymotic diseases has been kept at the average bv means of isolation and disinfection, but from tubercular and respiratory diseases the mortality has also been the highest of the Sub-Districts. (See table 8 A, B, and C.) III.—INPECTIOUS DISEASES. NOTIFICATION.

The increase in the number of the latter was mainly attributable to the outbreak of the disease at the Foundling Hospital in the last quarter of the year 16 The seasonal incidence of the infectious diseases is shown in the following table:— Monthly distribution of the Casts of Infectious Diseases certified to the Department throughout the Year 1891.

ENTERIC FEVER AT THE FOUNDLING HOSPITAL. At the beginning of 1892 I presented to your Yestry a special report upon the outbreak of Typhoid Fever that occurred at the end of 1891, in the Foundling Hospital, and I will briefly summarise the facts:— The number of cases of Typhoid was 35. The first case occurred about October 6th, 1891, and the last case about December 14th, so that the outbreak was distributed over 68 days. The disease was almost confined to the girls, only two boys being affected (total boy population 170); it was also practically confined to the east wing. Moreover, of the girls affected, the seniors suffered in a far higher proportion than the juniors, there being a marked preponderance in a certain ward called Ward G 3, and it was thought probable that this had something to do with their duties. The girls in this ward were being trained in household duties, and the incidence in different classes of girls in Ward G 3 was as follows:— Ward G 3 Total Number Number. Attacked. centage. Helpers 23 5 2l.7 House Girls 15 5 33. 7 Kitchen Girls 3 3 100.0 41 13 317 The clue to the cause of the outbreak was, therefore, probably to be found in the ingesta, the almost invariable cause of the larger ontbreaks of Typhoid Fever. Attention was therefore directed to the food, milk, and water supply. After a prolonged and minute inquiry into these matters, the cause of the outbreak was not disclosed. Attention was then turned to the drainage, and it was discovered that a certain grease trap had become contaminated with typhoid stools; that the contaminated vapours from this grease trap, after the cooking was completed and the copper taps were turned on for emptying and cleansing, poured into the kitchen, basement and staircases. In short, that the infection was vapour-borne, and this accounted for the greater incidence of the disease upon the young adults in proportion to the more frequent opportunities their occupation presented of inhaling the vapours, and the closer proximity in which their employment took 18 them to the source of the vapours, namely, the kitchen after the cooking and mealtimes w ere over. The taps being closed during cooking and meal times, and the food being sterilised in the coppers, saved the majority of the inmates and residents from attack. The details of the inquiry were duly set out in full in the special report, which concluded with the following:— Recommendations. The Governors of the Hospital have already decided to proceed with the construction of an Isolated Infirmary, and to institute Probationary Wards. The cisterns of the lumber room has been completely disconnected and only requires to be removed. The overflow from the twin-kitchen cistern has been satisfactorily altered. Instructions have been given to clear out the grease trap daily. It remains therefore— 1.—To radically alter the dangerous grease trap. 2.— To disconnect all waste pipes properly from the drains. 3.—To remove the sinks from the wards or dormitories. 4.—And lastly, I would recommend, as I have only been able to examine thoroughly a small section of the drainage arrangements, that a careful and thorough survey of the drainage, water supply, and ventilation systems of the whole building be made, that complete and correct plans of each, especially of the two former, be drawn up and be kept for reference, and that some one be held permanently responsible for periodically examining the systems, and for reporting their condition and maintenance. Scarlet Fever at the Orphan Working School.—At the end of the last week in August two cases of scarlatina were certified from this Institution, and by the third week in (September seven cases had been so certified. Realising the danger of such a highly infectious disease in an Institution containing some 500 children, boys and girls, I paid a visit to the School in order to examine the conditions and the precautions taken. So soon as the disease was recognised the infected children were immediately sent to the London Fever Hospital, the bedding was rubbed with carbolic acid, and the linen washed, I advised that the bedding should be disinfected at the Vestry's Steam Chamber, and all the linen be well boiled, but expressed doubts whether in large dormitories with a great number of beds disinfecting the bed of the patient and the adjoining beds would suffice to stay the infection and impressed the neccessity for taking every precaution. By the end of the first week in October the number of cases had increased to sixteen, and I paid a second visit t,o the Institution, pointing out to the matron the serious danger, as the points of infection were multiplying, and it was not confined to one dormitory. I also visited the Infirmary, which is situated at the top of the building, certain rooms in which are set apart for isolating doubtful feverish cases. The same day I wrote the Secretary urging that more radical measures should be taken by closing either a part of the School according to the incidence of the disease, or if necessary the whole, and thoroughly cleansing, washing, and disinfecting the building and its contents. At the same time pointing out that probably the disease was introduced by a new scholar, and the future necessity for requiring certificates from new scholars, that they have 19 neither suffered from nor been in contact with any sufferer from infectious disease previous to admission. Also that the wards for the isolation of infectious cases in the Infirmary at the top of the building were not satisfactory, and that a large School should be furnished with a separate building for this purpose, more isolated Also that particular attention should be paid to the health and management of the laundry, and special care should be exercised in the washing and the movement of infected fomites generally. In reply, the Governors stated that they had the matter under consideration. The following week the number of cases had increased to twenty-two, and I wrote urging the immediate closure of the School. A few days subsequently, in reply to an enquiry by the Medical Officer of the Institution as to the method of admitting the patients to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, I strongly urged no delay in closing the School, and a few days later still I wrote the Secretary that twenty-nine cases having ocurred it would be my duty to bring the matter before the Sanitary Authority. The Secretary replied to my letter that the Board had decided to close the School by the end of the month, and to carry out the necessary alterations, &c. Forty-two cases of Scarlet Fever ocurred in the Institution, the last being certified on the 27th October. Some difficulty was necessarily experienced in closing an Institution, the inmates of which number five hundred, and all orphans. Making allowance for this difficulty the children were removed from the building with and reasonable despatch, the School being finally closed on November 5th. ISOLATION.

Several houses have been viewed for the purpose of selection, but, for various reasons, have been considered undesirable by your Vestry or by your Health Committee. Several vacant spots have also been suggested for the purpose of erecting a temporary shelter, the corner plot on the east side of St. Pancras Gardens, the disinfecting chamber yard, and various plots of ground. Meanwhile, a few families were sheltered in the offices of the Health Department, no other place being available. This course is now discontinued since the objection thereto by your Vestry. There is practically no risk incurred by other houses in proximity to a properly managed shelter, but it is to be feared that, on other grounds, whatever 23 existing houses might be selected some opposition would be raised thereto. It would therefore, perhaps, be more desirable to erect a temporary structure on a piece of Vacant ground within reasonable distance of the Vestry Hall, as suggested in my last Aunual Report.

House to House Inspections.—The number of streets inspected from house to house during the year was 71, consisting of 1729 houses, of which 1663 were occupied, and 66 were unoccupied and passed over. These houses contained 10,559 rooms, of which 382 were unoccupied, and 10,177 occupied by 4,445 separate families, consisting of 10,673 adults and 6,813 children. (Table 96). A large number of notices were served for the abatement of nuisances in these houses which were systematically inspected, the notices served on casual complaints being very small. (Table 9a). 24 A sanitary inspection of the mews and stable yards of the district was also carried out during 1891 and the 1st quarter of 1892, for the purpose of ascertaining the conditions prevailing in this class of dwellings, a record of which will be found in the Appendix. (Table 9c.) Registered Tenement Houses.—Dwelling houses not constructed of separate dwellings, but of which the rooms or groups of rooms, are let to separate occupiers, are more concisely termed "tenement" houses, than "houses let in lodgings to members of more than one family." Under the Bye-laws framed in accordance with sec. 35 of the Sanitary Act, of 1866, 136 houses of this class have been registered. Registered Common Lodging Houses, are a class of houses totally distinct from the above, being true lodging houses of which the sleeping, living, and other rooms and appurtenances are used in common by the lodgers. Of these houses registered under the Bye-laws framed by the Chief Commissioner of Police, a list will be found in the appendix. (List II.) Collective Dwelling Houses, or Block Dwelling houses, or houses constructed and let in separate dwellings will also be found in the appendix compiled into a table with particulars. (List I.) Movable Dwellings.—Canal boats passing through, or discharging, or loading, in the district have been from time to time inspected, but no infringement of the Acts has been found. No caravans, tents, or sheds have been reported to be occupied as dwellings in St. Pancras. Underground Dwelling-rooms.—The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by sec. 96, has extended and amplified the restrictions upon this class of dwellings, but by sub-section 3 provides such of these additional requirements in the new Act as involve the structural alteration of the building, may be modified or dispensed with by the Sanitary Authority, either by general regulations providing for classes of underground rooms, or in a special case by resolution after consideration of the fitness of the room, the house accommodation of the district, the sanitary condition of the inhabitants, and other circumstances. The suggestion of general regulations providing for various classes of underground rooms, is a valuable idea, worthy of the consideration of your Vestry and Health Committee., Insanitary Dwelling-houses.—The following table is a complete list of the houses represented as unfit for human habitation and of the action taken thereon, since the passing of the Housing of the Working Classes Act in August, 1890. The object of including the latter part of 1390 with 1891, is to make the record complete since the passing of the new Act. Representations made under the old Acts were invalidated by the repeal and in some cases fresh representations had to be made under the new Act. 25 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, L890.

This letter was referred to the Sanitary Committee by your Vestry on the 3rd April, 1889, and the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Surveyor were instructed to furnish a joint report accordingly. The joint report was furnished, and was received and approved by your Vestry on the 20th November, 1889, and a copy of the joint report accompanied by a plan were directed to be forwarded to the London County Council. This was not an official representation under the Acts, but from time to time letters were addressed to your Vestry by the County Council urging your Vestry to take action, and intimating that the Council did not propose to undertake a scheme under the Artizaus and Labourers Dwellings Acts. Meanwhile these Acts were repealed and replaced by the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. On the 12th July, 1890, a further communication from the Council requesting to be favoured with any resolution which your Vestry might have arrived with reference to certain ateas mentioned in the report of 1889, induced me to visit and review the three principal areas reported upon, and to extend my inspection and examination, which resulted in making on the 12th February, 1891, the following official representations under Part 1 of the new Act, direct to the Council in accordance with statutory procedure. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, St. Pancras 12th February, 1891. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.—Part 1. Unhealthy Areas. To the Clerk to the London County Council. Sir, Pursuant to Section 4 of the above Act, I beg to make an official representation that the area of Somers Town, more particularly the portion situated between Euston Road, Seymour Street, Ossulston Street, and Clarendon Square, contains houses, courts or alleys unfit for human habitation, and the narrowness, closeness, and bad arrangement and condition of the streets and houses, or groups of houses, within such area, and the want of light, air, ventilation, and proper conveniences, and the presence of other sanitary defects, are dangerous and injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the buildings in the said area, and of the neighbouring buildings, and that the evils connected with such houses, courts and alleys, and the sanitary defects in such area, cannot be effectually remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and re-construction of the streets and houses within such area, or of some of such streets and houses. The possibilities of improvement schemes are various, but I would beg to submit that the Polygon and the square in which it is situated is the only well opened portion in the district, and there would be space to construct a street from 27 this point to Euston Road, which would clear away the present objectionable buildings create sites for artizans' dwellings with ample frontage, and open up a number of transverse streets which are at present mere cul-de-sacs. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J. SYKES, Medical Officer of Health for the Vestry of St. Pancras. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, St. Pancras, 12th February, 1891. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.—Part 1. Unhealthy Areas. To the Clerk to the London County Council. Sir, Pursuant to Section 4 of the above Act, I beg to make an official representation that the areas of (1) Prospect Terrace and Derry Street, Gray's Inn Road, and of (2) .North Crescent Mews and Bramtone Place, Mabledon Place, Euston Road, contain houses, courts or alleys, unfit for human habitation, and that the narrowness, closeness and bad arrangement and condition of the streets, houses, or groups of bouses, and the want of light, air, ventilation and proper conveniences, and the presence of other sanitary defects, are dangerous or injurious to the health of the inhabitants of the buildings in the said areas and of the neighbouring buildings, and that the evils connected with such houses, courts or alleys, and the sanitary defects in such areas cannot be effectually remedied otherwise than by an improvement scheme for the re-arrangement and re-construction of the streets and houses within such area, or of some such streets or houses. I had originally contemplated reporting these areas to the Yestry of Saint Pancras under Part 2 of the Act. It appears that the Act does not provide for an area being so reported by a Medical Officer of Health, but only for individual houses in such an area. The only course therefore left open by the Act, in order to embrace an area in a representation, is for me to report it to your Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN F. J. SYKES, Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry of St. Pancras. Upon receipt of the representations, the Council communicated with your Vestry, and requested a d putation to be appointed to meet the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Council, and confer with them On the 30th April, and the 21st May, 189 i, letters were received from the Council acquainting your Vestry that the Committee and the Council had resolved that the areas represented were not of general importance to the County of London, and should be dealt with under Part II. of the Act. That is to say, that your Vestry, and not the Council, should make schemes for dealing with the areas, and should incur the necessary expenditure for carrying them out. On the 5th August, 1891, your Vestry resolved to submit the matter to the Home Secretary, and to request him 28 to be pleased to appoint an Arbitrator and direct a local inquiry to be made. Mr. . Cubitt Nichols was so appointed. and opened the inquiry on the 23rd October, 1891 A technical difficulty as to the name and extent of the largest area led to the adjournment of the inquiry. Since then, the matter has remained under the consideration of the County Council and of your Vestry. WORKSHOPS AND FACTORIES. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, has provided additional powers over the sanitary condition of workshops and factories, and it will make the powers of your Vestry clearer if the provisions of the sections are set out in sequence according to procedure. Section 10. The Sanitary Authority shall have a right to enter from time to time any premises (a) for the purpose of examining as to the existence thereon of any nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act at any hour by day, or in the case of a nuisance arising in respect of any business, then at any hour when the business is in progress or is usually carried on * * * Section 38 (1) Every factory, workshop, and workplace, whether erected before or after the passing of this Act, shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons employed in or in attendance at such building, and also where persons of both sexes are, or are intended to be employed, or in attendance, with pr >per separate accommodation for persons of each sex. (2) Where it appears to a Sanitary Authority that this section is not complied with in the case of any factory, workshop, or workplace, the Sanitary Authority shall, by notice served on the owner or occupier of such factory, workshop, or workplace, require him to make the alterations and additions necessary to secure such compliance, and if the person served with such notice fails to comply therewith, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds, and to a fine not exceeding forty shillings for every day after conviction during which the non-compliance continues. Section 26.—(1) Sections thirty-four, thirty-five, and eighty-one of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, and Sections fifteen and sixteen of the Factory and Workshops Act Amendment Act, 1883 (which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, and other sanitary conditions), shall, as respects every bakehouse which is a workshop, be enforced by the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the bakehouse is situate, and they shall be the local authority within the meaning of those sections. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1878. Sec. 34. —Where a bakehouse is situate in any city, town, or place, containing, according to the last published Census for the time being, a population of more than five thousand persons, all the inside walls of the rooms of such bakehouse, and all the ceilings or tops of such rooms (whether such walls, ceilings, or tops be plastered or not), and all the passages and staircases of such bakehouse, shall either be painted with oil or varnished, or be limewashed, or be partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed; where painted with oil or varnished there shall be three coa s of paint or varnish, and the paint or varnish shall be renewed once at least in every seven years, and shall be washed with hot water and soap once at least in every six months; where limewashed the limewashing shall be renewed once at least in every six months. A bakehouse in which there is any contravention of this section shall be deemed not to be kept iu conformity with this Act. 29 Sec. 35.—Where a bakehouse is situate in any city, town, or place containing, according to the last published Census for the time being, a population of more than five thousand persons, a place on the same level with the bakehouse, and forming part of the same building, shall not be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows, that is to say— Unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and — Unless there be an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at the least four-and-a-half superficial feet are made to open for ventilation. Any person who lets or occupies or continues to let, or knowingly suffers to be occupied any place contrary to this section shall be liable to a fine not exceeding, for the first offence, twenty shillings, and for every subsequent offence five pounds. Sec. 81—If a factory or workshop is not kept in conformity with this Act, the oocupier thereof shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. The Court of Summary Jurisdiction, in addition to or instead of inflicting such fine, may order certain means to be adopted by the occupier, within the time named in the order, for the purpose of bringing his factory or workshop into conformity with this Act; the Court may, upon application, enlarge the time so named, but if, after the expiration of the time as originally named or enlarged by subsequent order, the order is not complied with, the occupier shall be liable to a line not exceeding one pound for every day that such non-compliance continues. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1883. Sec. 15.—It shall not be lawful to let or suffer to be occupied as a bakehouse, or to occupy as a bakehouse, any room or place which was not so let or occupied before the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-three, unless the following regulations are complied with: — (1) No water-closet, earth-closet, privy, or ashpit, shall be within or communicate directly with the bakehouse. (2) Any cistern for supplying water to the bakehouse shall be separate and distinct from any cistern for supplying water to a water-closet. (3) No drain or pipe for carrying off foecal or sewage matter shall have an opening within the bakehouse. Any person who lets or suffers to be occupied or who occupies any room or place as a bakehouse in contravention of this section shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding forty shillings, and to a further fine not exceeding five shillings for every day during which any room or place so occupied after a conviction under this section. Sec. 16.—Where a Court of Summary Jurisdiction is satisfied on the prosecution of an Inspector or a Local Authority, that any room or place used as a bakehouse (whether the same was or was not so used before the passing of this Act) is in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse, the occupier of the bakehouse shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding forty shillings, and on a second or any subsequent conviction, not exceeding five pounds. The Court of Summary Jurisdiction, in addition to or instead of inflicting such fine, may order means to be adopted by the occupier, within the time named in the order, for the purpose of removing the ground of complaint. The Court may, upon application, enlarge the time so named, but if, after the expiration of the time as originally named or enlarged by subsequent order, the order is not complied with, the occupier shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one pound for every day that such non-compliance continues. Section 25.—(1) Where, on the certificate of a Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector, it appears to any Sanitary Authority that the limewashing, cleansing, or purifying of any workshops (other than a bakehouse), or of any part thereof, is necessary for the health of the persons employed therein, the Sanitary Authority shall serve notice in writing on the owner or occupier of the workshops to limewash, cleanse or purify the workshops or part, as the case requires, within the time specified in the notice, and if the person on whom notice is so served fails 30 to comply therewith, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and to a farther fine not exceeding ten shillings for every day daring which he continues to make default after conviction ; and the Sanitary Authority may, if they think fit, cause the workshops or part to be limewashed, cleansed, or purified, and may recover in a summary manner the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the person on whom the notice was served. (2) This section shall apply to any factory that is not subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, and the Acts amending the same, and to any workplace, in like manner as it applies to a workshop. Section 2.—(1) For the purposes of this Act,—* * * * (g) Any factory, workshop, or workplace which is not a factor}' subject to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878, relating to cleanliness, ventilation, and overcrowding, and (t.) is not kept in a cleanly state and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, earth-closet, water-closet, urinal, or other nuisance, or (ii.) is not ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless as far as practicable any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the work carried on therein that are a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, or (iii.) is so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be injurious or dangerous to the health of those employed therein,—shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act. (2) Provided that—* * * * (ii.) In considering whether any dwelling-bouse or part of a dwelling-house which is used also as a factory, workshop, or workplace, or whether any factory, workshop, or workplace used also as a dwelling-house, is a nuisance by reason of overcrowding, the court shall have regard to the circumstance of such other user. It would appear that a London Sanitary Authority has no power under the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891, unless and until a complaint is made by a Factory Inspector, when the Sanitary Authority is bound to act upon the complaint. WATER SUPPLV AND WATER SERVICE. The district is supplied with water on the constant high pressure system, with the exception of the area lying between Albany Street and Regent's Park. All the water closets in the district have water laid on, and the work of your Health Department is directed towards causing the supply to be maintained, and to be efficient in quantity and manner of distribution for the purpose of flushing. The flush-tanks required for w.c.'s disconnect the closet supply from direct communication with the water in cisterns supplying water for domestic use. The overflow pipes of cisterns being disconnected from drains and discharging in the open, and the cisterns being properly covered, contamination is largely prevented. But cisterns also become foul from within, if not cleansed at intervals, and when the cleansing is omitted, or insufficient, and especially if the cistern be badly situated, or be inaccessible, the only safeguard is to remove the draw taps from connection with the cisterns and attach them on the main supply pipes. This is the course pursued in such cases, the cisterns being allowed to remain if supplying the flush-tanks of w c.'s, as they may become useful for reserve supply in case of break-down and temporary stoppage of the main supply. If a cistern supply no draw-taps nor flush-tanks, nor other receptacles, it is useless, and the contained 31 water will become stagnant and offensive; in such a case it is desirable to remove the cistern altogether; for even if it be run dry and the supply be cut off, it will remain to accumulate dust and dirt and harbour vegetable and animal living organisms. The Bye laws of your Vestry (under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891), to be confirmed by the Local Government Board, in reference to tanks, cisterns, and receptacles for storing water, will facilitate the work of your Inspectors in protecting the purity of domestic water, and will be of especially timely assistance if cholera should threaten. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The Regulations of your Vestry in reference to drainage (set out in last year's report) will be supplemented at no distant date by the Bye-laws of your Vestry for keeping w.c.'s supplied with sufficient water for their effective action, and by the Bye-laws of the County Council with respect to w.c's and the proper accessories thereof in connexion with buildings, these Bye-laws being drawn under the Public Health (Loudon) Act, 1891. The mention of sewerage cannot be passed over without drawing attention to the great improvement effected by your Vestry in replacing the old defective by new and improved sewers in Gordon and Tavistock Squares and the adjoining thoroughfares. REFUSE REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL. During 1891 the old system of house-dust collection was still in force, and it must be reserved for the report of 1892 to speak of the improvements effected by the system since adopted, and foreshadowed in the previous annual report. Two important additional points in connection with refuse removal are receiving attention. The first is the question of the method of disposal that your Vestry has under consideration, and that will propably be solved by the erection of refuse destructors; and the second is the method of temporary storage upon private premises, which will probably be provided for in the Bye-laws of the London County Council by the requirement of portable metal dust-bins NUISANCES. Water Nuisances.—A cistern in such a state as to be dangerous to health is a nuisance under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. This new provision materially facilitates the protection of domestic water supplies in the presence of a threatened cholera outbreak, and the coming Bye-laws iu reference to tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles will complete it'. Drain Nuisances.—By means of the volatile and smoke tests and other facilities supplied to your Sanitary Inspectors, they are now better enabled to verify complaints of drain nuisances than formerly. Accumulations of Bones, 8(c.—The accumulations of decomposable organic matters liable to take place in marine stores or rag and bone shops, situated beneath or in contiguity to dwelling houses, receive periodical attention for the purpose of preventing the quantity or condition of such accumulations becoming dangerous to health. Sunken Manure-pits.—A dung-pit in such a state as to be dangerous to health is a statutory nuisance and the objections to sunken receptacles for manure, &c., 32 in close proximity to dwellings are:—(1) That being below ground and storing wet refuse, they are the counterpart of cesspools; (2) That the tops being either level with the ground, or below it, or uncovered, rain and surface drainage flow in, and they become cesspits; (3) That they cannot be drained, because the drain inlets must be at the bottom, and the first castings of manure or other refuse block the inlets and prevent the liquids draining away. The bottom of a manure bin should be slightly above the level of the adjoining ground and so sloped as to drain towards the front or side, through which there should be an opening or openings at ground level to permit the liquids to drain out and away to a properly trapped gulley. Falling rain is best warded off by a fixed roof, a covering several feet above the top of the bin, this allows the free play of air, and the refuse may be readily cast in and removed. Hinged and other forms of movable covers, being cumbersome, more frequently remain open than closed, and when conscientiously used, are not permanent, for constant rough usage soon unhinges or destroys them. Sunken ash-pits are even more objectionable than sunken manure-pits. Your Health Committee had the opportunity of seeing the condition that such receptacles present at the blocks of dwellings in Duke's road, and ordered their abolition accordingly. Hitherto the guiding principle in the temporary storage of manure, ashes, and other refuse, seems to have been that of getting the refuse most easily and most readily into the receptacle, whereas the guide to construction should be the ease and readiness with which it may be got out of the receptacle and removed. Smoke.—By Section 33 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, it is provided that every furnace employed in the working of engines by steam, and every furnace employed in any public bath or wash-house, or in any mill, factory, printing-house, dye-house, iron foundry, glass-house, distiller}', brew-house, sugar refinery, bakehouse, gasworks, waterworks or other buildings used for the purpose of trade or manufacture (although a steam engine be not used or employed therein), shall be constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising from such furnace. If any person, being the owner or occupier of the premises, or being a foreman or other person employed by such owner or occupier, uses any such furnace which is not constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising therefrom ; or so negligently uses any such furnace as that the smoke arising therefrom is not effectually consumed or burnt; or carries on any trade or business which occasions any noxious or offensive effluvia, or otherwise annoys the neighbourhood or inhabitants, without using the best practicable means for preventing or counteracting such effluvia or other annoyance, such person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and on a second conviction to a fine of ten pounds, and on each subsequent conviction to a fine double the amount of the fine imposed on the last preceding conviction. In this section the words " consume or burn the smoke," shall not be held in all cases to mean "consume or burn all the smoke," and the Court hearing an information against a person may remit the fine if of opinion that such person has so constructed his furnace as to consume or burn as far as possible all the smoke arising from such furnace, and has carefully attended to the same, and consumed or burned as far as possible the smoke arising from such furnace. It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to enforce the provisions of this section, and an information shall not be laid for the recovery of any fine 33 under this section, except under the direction of a Sanitary Authority. By Sections 100 and 101 of the Act, if the Sanitary Authority make default in enforcing these provisions, the County Council may substitute the necessary proceedings at the cost of the Sanitary Authority, or proceedings may be taken against the Sanitary Authority. By Section 24 of the Act it is further provided that any fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the combustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam, or in any mill, factory, dye-house, brewery, bakehouse, or gas-work, or in any manufacturing or trade process whatsoever ; and any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance; shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act and the provisions of this Act relating to those nuisances shall apply accordingly; provided that the Court hearing a complaint against a person in respect of a nuisance arising from a fireplace or furnace which does not consume the smoke arising from the combustible used iu such fireplace or furnace, shall hold that no nuisance is created, and dismiss the complaint, if satisfied that such fireplace or furnace is constructed in such manner as to consume as far as practicable, having regard to the nature of the manufacture or trade, all smoke arising therefrom, and that such fireplace or furnace has been carefully attended to by the person having charge thereof. In order to carry out these Sections of the Act, your Sanitary Inspectors have been provided with Standard diagrams of smoke shades, and with detailed instructions. In recording obervations of smoke the following points must be stated:— 1. Date and time of day. 2. Situation of chimney. 3. Kind of sky or background against which the smoke is seen issuing. 4. The density and variations in the density of the smoke, according to the numbers on the " diagram of smoke shades.'' 5. The duration in minutes of the prevalence of each particular shade of density. Note.—(a) Distinguish smoke from steam, or steam and smoke mixed. (b) If the density and duration of the smoke be sufficient to constitute a marked nuisance do not fail to enquire who has oharge of the furnace at the time. If at any time a marked nuisance be proved to arise from any furnace chimney, I would recommend that the report of an engineer upon the construction of the furnace be obtained previous to taking proceedings. The Regent's Canal is still under the consideration of your Health Committee, the points receiving attention being cleansing, and the prevention of stagnation generally, but in particular the scavenging of the surface two or three times a week, the scavenging of the bottom annually, and the construction of an overflow in the Cumberland Basin, at the end of the dead arm. These recommendations have been repeatedly made for some years past. 34 SUMMONSES. Under the Nuisances Removal, Sanitary, Metropolis Local Management Acts, and Factory and Workshop Act, 1883.

The Slaughter-houses licensed in the Parish have during the year been kept in accordance with the Bye-Laws. The Cowsheds licensed have also been kept in compliance with the regulations. The Dairies and Milkshops, so far as the storage of Milk is concerned, are controlled by the County Council. The Bakehouses are inspected twice annually, and the proper cleansings enforced. A bakehouse in Queen's Crescent was discovered in such a structural condition as to be unfit for use as a bakehouse. All the open space at the rear and side of the house was built or covered over to the first-floor level, beneath this the back kitchen window was taken out and an oven built out under the back yard. Both light aad air were thus excluded from bakehouse. Legal proceedings resulted in an order being made against the occupier to make alterations to admit of proper access of light and air to the room used as a bakehouse, or cease to use it for that purpose, and a fine of forty shillings and costs were imposed. The Fish-frying Shops have not supplied auy cause of complaint during the year. 35 UNFIT FOOD.

Sampling of Milk in transit.—From time to time opinions of regret have been expressed, especially in the press, that samples of milk are not taken systematically at railway stations. St. Pancras has within its borders the termini and depots of the three great railway companies from the North, and milk is delivered at the Euston Station of the London and North Western, at the King's Cross Station of the Great Northern, and at the Phoenix Street, Kentish Town, and Haverstock Hill Stations of the Midland Railway Company. On a day of twenty-four hours in the third week in April, 1892, the number of churns delivered at these stations was ascertained to be as follows: L. & N. W. R. Euston 750 G. N. R. King's Cross 790 M. R. Phoenix Street 870 „ Kentish Town 210 „ Haverstock Hill 25 Total 2,645 38 The churns averaged six and a half barn gallons, a barn gallon being double an imperial gallon, this represents 34,385 imperial gallons. In April, 1892, Mr. R. Henry Rew, in relating before the Royal Statistical Society, an inquiry into the statistics of the production and consumption of milk and milk products of Great Britain," estimated the total daily milk supply of London in 1890 as 133,000 gallons. Messrs. Wynter Blyth and Alfred Spencer in the Transactions of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, 1885-6, estimated the mean daily supply in 1884 as 110,000 gallons, of which over three-fourths arrived by rail. So that somewhere between one-third and one-fourth of the daily milk supply of London arrives through railway stations and depots in St. Pancras. The churns are consigned to a considerable number of consignees the large majority of whom occupy premises outside St. Pancras. So that not only is the protection of the milk supply of St. Pancras concerned in the condition of the station deliveries but also that of a large part of the metropolis. Nevertheless, as the effect of many suggestions, it was decided in the first quarter of the year to take samples of milk from the churns in transit at the Railway Stations. Inspector Osborne was specially detailed for this work and was furnished with a stirer inside a walking stick, for the purpose of mixing the milk in order to obtain an average sample from a churn One hundred samples were taken and five prosecutions were the result The quality of the milk varies greatly in different churns from the same producer, hence it is necessary to sample every churn of a consignor. In the ordinary course of events when the wholesale milk-dealer discovers that he is receiving milk below the standard he complains to the Sanitary Authority that a certain producer is sending adulterated milk to Town. Last year some seven complaints of suspected adulteration were received from resident milk-dealers In the absence of a voluntary complaint it is extremely difficult for a Sanitary Authority's Officer to take samples at railway stations of milk in transit and to obtain a conviction for adulteration, in order to keep a check upon the rural producer or consignor, without the co-operation of the wholesale dealer or consignee. In the first place, passive obstruction may block the way. Railway servants will not willingly assist in the matter unless remunerated for the extra labour involved, and if better paid by the milk-dealers to obstruct will doubtless make it more convenient to do so. The position of an Inspector hunting for a particular consignment of milk in a vanfull, and his still more hopeless position when it is ultimately found deposited in an inaccessible place requiring the shifting of a dozen or two other churns, can easily be conceived. There may also be collusion between the consignor and consignee either from common interests or friendships, in which case the work of the Inspector would be of the detective type. The consignee's evidence is absolutly necessary to obtain a conviction for adulteration in order to prove the contract to deliver pure milk, and practically, the consignee is master of the situation. He protects himself against the producer by requiring a warranty and uses the Sanitary Authority to enforce it, on the other hand he evades giving a guarantee himself to the small retailers. If the consumer (i.e., the public), is to be protected from the adulteration, not only of the retailer, but of others through whose hands the milk passes, it would appear only consistent that the next check should be upon the wholesaler, and upon the producer last. It is of little value to control the producer and to let the whole sale dealer, who has the subsequent manipulation of immense quantities of milk, to go free. 39 VI.—LEGISLATION. Public Health (London) Act, 1891.—The provisions of this Act have already been fully dealt with in the circular of the Local Government Board, the report to your Health Committee, and the various summaries and criticisms of the press.
