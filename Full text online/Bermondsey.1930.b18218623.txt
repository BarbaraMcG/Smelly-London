PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, MUNICIPAL OFFICES, SPA ROAD, S.E.16. Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report for the year 1930. In Sect. 10, which is included for the first time, there will be found time-tables and other information in connection with various clinics and organisations at work in the borough. I would draw special attention to progress in connection with the Maternity and Child Welfare, Midwifery, Nursing and Dental Schemes. While a great effort has been made to deal with the defective housing conditions in the borough it still remains the fact that these conditions constitute one of the most difficult problems which this Council has to face. The Annual Report provides a iitting opportunity to express the thanks of the Department to the Council for the provision of accommodation in the New Municipal Offices. I would like at the same time to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of Committees, to the staff of the Department and to the General Manager of Works who has so kindly supplied the report on refuse collection. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D. M. CONNAN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. GENERAL. The area of the Borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres. At the 1921 Census there were 18,266 structually separate dwellings in the Borough, which were inhabited by 28,610 families or separate occupiers. The number of inhabited houses at the end of 1930 according to the rate books was 18,596. The rateable value of the Borough on the 31st December, 1930, was £769,898, the product of a penny rate being £3,080. POPULATION. The Registrar General, in computing his estimate of the population for the mid-year 1930 intends to take into account the population as ascertained by the 1931 Census ; the 1930 estimate will therefore not be available before the end of Tune 1931. The Ministry of Health has suggested that the preparation of the Annual Report should not be delayed on this account, but that the Registrar General's mid-year 1929 estimate of the population might be used. This suggestion has been adopted, and the population figure of 113,800 has been used in calculating Birth, Death and other rates for 1930. Census Estimate of Registrar General 1921 to 30th June, 1929 to 30th June, 1930 1911 125,903 119,452 113,800 BIRTHS. The total number of births belonging to the Borough registered during 1930 was 2,059, consisting of 1,075 males and 984 females. The number for 1929 was 2,252. The birth rate for 1930 was 18.1 per 1,000 persons living, compared with 19.8 for 1929. DEATHS. The total number of deaths belonging to the Borough registered during 1930 was 1,488, consisting of 828 males and 660 females. The number for 1929 was 1,650. The death rate for 1930 was 13.1 per 1,000 persons living, compared with 14.5 for 1929. MARRIAGES. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1930 was 1021, being 27 above the number for 1929, and 44 below the average for the last 10 years. The figures have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. This makes a marriage rate of 17.94 per 1,000 of the population, compared with a marriage rate last year of 17.47.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ETC. The following diseases are notifiable :— Anthrax Acute Polioencephalitis Acute Primary Pneumonia Acute Poliomyelitis Acute Influenzal Pneumonia Cholera Continued Fever Cerebro Spinal Meningitis Diphtheria Encephalitis Lethargica Enteric Fever and Typhoid Fever Erysipelas Hydrophobia in Man Glanders Membranous Croup Malaria Puerperal Fever Relapsing Fever Ophthalmia Neonatorum Puerperal Pyrexia Small Pox Tuberculosis—all forms Scarlet Fever and Scarlatina Typhus Owing to the housing conditions of the Borough, it is the practice to remove to hospital nearly all cases of diphtheria and scarlet fever. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases notified is one less than last year namely 462, and of these 31 cases were returned as not suffering from Diphtheria, so that the actual number of cases was 431. Of these patients eight died as the result of the disease. The number of patients attending the Schick Clinic is still very small and shows practically no increase as compared with last year. There were two positive cases in addition to those shown below. One case refused to attend after the first immunisation ,and in the other case immunisation could not be carried out as the patient was admitted to a Heart Hospital. No. found to be negative No. of sessions Total attendances No. of patients examined No. found to be positive and immunised 13 32 47 151 59 SCARLET FEVER. There has been a slight fall in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever, 507 cases being notified this year as against 584 last year. Twenty cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from Scarlet Fever and seven patients died. SMALL POX. Our good fortune with regard to Small-pox has continued, and only 47 cases were notified ; in only one case was the diagnosis not confirmed. In every instance the disease was mild in form and there were no deaths. One primary vaccination and eight re-vaccinations were performed under the Public Health (Small-pox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. MEASLES. As I stated in last year's Report special arrangements were made with the School Medical Officer in anticipation of a winter epidemic. It was hoped that with the assistance of the school nurses earlier knowledge of suspected cases would be obtained. The School Medical Officer has kindly supplied me with the following summary of the work done by the school nurses during the epidemic, i.e., December 1929 to June 1930 inclusive :— Number of hours devoted to Measles work .. .. 570 Number of definite cases of Measles excluded by nurse and reported to Medical Officer of Health .. .. l Number of suspicious cases excluded by nurse .. .. 130 Number of suspicious or doubtful absentees reported .. 1,157 Number of suspicious cases excluded by nurse which subsequently proved to be Measles .. .. .. 49 Number of suspicious absentees reported which were confirmed as definite cases of Measles .. .. .. 277 Every suspected case, reported from whatever source, was Immediately visited by the District Inspector. The total number of cases reported during the year was 1,418, and there were 61 NOTIFIED CASES OF DIPHTHERIA FOR 25 YEARS. NOTIFIED GASES OF SCARLET FEVER FOR 25 YEARS. deaths; 153 cases were admitted to Hospital, and nursing was provided at home for 144 cases. In the absence of notification the arrangement with the School Medical Officer was of some advantage, and is certainly worthy of further trial. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. The following table gives particulars of the number of cases of this disease. In two instances nursing was provided : — Cases Deaths Vision Unimpaired Notified Treated Total Blindness Vision Impaired At home In Hospital 13 5 13 - 8 - - PUERPERAL FEVER AND PUERPERAL PYREXIA. The number of cases notified was, as follows :— Puerperal Fever .. 14 Puerperal Pyrexia .. 19 Facilities are provided by the Council for assistance in the diagnosis and treatment of these cases. These facilities include the provision of the services of a consultant and of a nurse where necessary. We also undertake bacteriological examinations and arrange for the admission of patients to hospital where this is desired. Compared with last year there was an increase of two in the number of cases of Puerperal Fever. Twelve of these patients were removed the hospital and four died in hospital.

Disinfection of premises and of articles exposed to infection is insisted upon in all cases of notifiable infectious disease. Respect is always had as far as possible to the convenience and comfort of the householder. Rooms are sealed up for disinfection and beds, bedding, clothes and other articles are removed and disinfected at the station. I am pleased to be able to report that the new disinfecting station is well on the way to completion and there is a decided prospect that it will be opened within the course of a few months. The existing station was built as a temporary structure some twenty-five years ago because at that time no suitable site for a station of adequate size was available. The building of the Electric Light Station and of the New Offices have both interfered somewhat with the present disinfecting station, and work has been carried on under great difficulties for some time past. It is, therefore, a matter for congratulation that we have had no serious epidemic and so few cases of small-pox during this period. The new station will be on three floors and the arrangement can be seen on the accompanying plans. The ground floor will be occupied solely with the disinfection and cleansing of household goods and personal clothing, and the arrangements are such that articles coming in dirty will be kept entirely separate from those going out clean. On the first floor provision has been made for the cleansing of 4,000 verminous children per annum. These, of course, will come from other districts besides Bermondsey and the L.C.C. has already been consulted in the matter. On this floor also there will be baths and dressing rooms for the staff, and a drying and mangling room for sheets, pillow-slips and other similar goods. Verminous baths for adults are provided on the second floor, together with a separate bathroom for the treatment of scabies, NEW DISINFECTING STATION, BERMONDSEY. GROUND FLOOR PLAN.

Four flats are provided in The Neckinger for the temporary housing of families or persons while their premises are being disinfected ; 137 persons were accommodated during the year, most of these being in connection with cases of small-pox. BACTERIOLOGICAL LABORATORY. The work of the bacteriological laboratory consists mainly in the examination of sputa for tubercle bacilli and the examination of throat swabs for diphtheria bacilli. Many of the throat swabs are sent by general practitioners and sterile outfits for this purpose are supplied free on application to the Medical Officer of Health. All diphtheria contacts of school age are excluded from school (22) until the throat swab is negative. A positive result of course necessitates a further examination, and treatment in the meantime by the private practitioner. Proved " Carriers " are usually referred to the London County Council " Carriers' " Clinic at Guy's Hospital. In addition to the examination of swabs and sputa, other bacteriological investigations are undertaken when requested.

It is not yet possible to give a full account of this scheme, but a further stage has been reached. A competition was arranged in compliance with the rules of the Royal Institute of British Architects and designs for the building will shortly be under consideration. FOOT CLINIC. This clinic was opened on the 7th May at 98 Rotherhithe New Road to provide treatment for minor troubles of the feet such as corns, callosities, bunions, ingrowing and thickened toenails and warts. These ailments are extremely common and very troublesome, and yet by virtue of their very insignificance are often neglected. The clinic is not intended to usurp the functions of an orthopaedic department, and cases of flat feet and other similar deformities are not treated, but are referred to their own doctors. The clinic is staffed by qualified chiropodists and students from the Chelsea Polytechnic Training Centre, and I have to thank Mr. Bride and Miss Montgomery of that institution for their very valuable help in starting the clinic and their active co-operation in running it. In the beginning there were two sessions a week, on Wedneday afternoon and evening. It soon became necessary to increase the number of sessions, and at present the clinic is open for five sessions a week, on three afternoons and two evenings. One of the afternoons is reserved for patients who are seen by appointment only, and only patients who are at work in the day time are seen at the evening sessions. Miss Montgomery is inchàrge of the clinic and associated with her are a number of paid assistants and a number of students from the Polytechnic. A charge of sixpence is made for each treatment, and in the case of patients seen by appointment the charge is one shilling. Each chiropodist works in a cubicle and there are at present five cubicles in operation at each session. The cost of equipping a cubicle is approximately £10. The number of attendances up to date has been 3,589 ; males 992 and females 2,597 ; and the number has shown a progressive increase each month, so that it will be necessary in the immediate future to consider the opening of a second clinic in the other half of the borough. I hope that it may be possible to provide more sessions for men in the evenings and possibly one on Saturday afternoon, and I think it likely that the appointment session will be abolished as it appears to be less popular than the ordinary session. NURSING. In my last Annual Report it was stated that arrangements had been made with the Nursing Associations to provide general nursing assistance, where necessary, at a fee of tenpence per visit. I very much regret that this scheme was disallowed by the Minister who was not prepared to sanction the Council's proposals. Our scheme was accordingly modified to comply with his requirements on the 16th January, 1930, and we are (24) therefore only able to assist in providing nursing for expectant and nursing mothers, children under five, and for certain cases of infectious disease including Tuberculosis. It is, however, interesting to note that the encouragement given to the Nursing Associations by this Council has resulted in a considerable increase in their activities and I think also in their efficiency.

This rate is slightly higher than the rate for 1929, but is lower than that of any other year since 1920. This increase may perhaps be due to a greater number of deaths occurring at a later age in life. In the aged, particularly in the case of those who suffer from chronic bronchitis, it is difficult and may be impossible by physical examination alone, to detect tuberculosis, and the increased facilities for radiological examinations have been of great benefit in this connection. The detection of such cases is of great importance because of the danger of infection to others, especially infants, living in the same house, and for this reason it is advisable as far as possible to retain these patients for treatment in the local hospital. Work in the Dispensary has continued on the same lines as in previous years. The arrangement with St. Olave's Hospital for X-ray examination of dispensary patients has continued to operate satisfactorily, and the number of examinations shows an increase, due partly to more frequent requests from practitioners of the district. The more extended use of radiology in the investigation of pulmonary tuberculosis has revealed the fact that in many cases, particularly in young persons, the onset of the disease is comparatively sudden and acute, and that the advance of the disease may be extremely rapid. In order to stimulate the interest of practitioners in the borough, a meeting was arranged during the year at which Dr. H. V. Morlock, physician to the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, read a paper on the subject, illustrated by X-ray films of typical cases. The meeting was well attended and much appreciated. Immediate treatment by rest in bed is of the utmost importance in dealing with early cases, and during the year numbers of patients have been admitted at once to the hospital where they have received the preliminary treatment which is necessary before they become fit for transfer to Sanatorium. In selected cases artificial pneumothorax treatment has been started by the medical officers of the hospital and this treatment is continued (28) later at sanatorium after the transfer of the patient. Arrangements have also been made for this treatment to be continued by the tuberculosis officers following the return of patients from sanatorium, and in two instances patients have been enabled to attend for treatment in the evenings, so that they might not lose time from work. In dealing with early cases invaluable assistance has been rendered by the two District Nursing Associations. As has been stated above, rest in bed is imperative at the onset of the disease, and, in cases where it has been impracticable to secure immediate admission to hospital, great benefit has been derived from the regular visits of the district nurse. This preliminary rest, ensuring , as it does, close supervision and a daily record of the temperature , is of the greatest value to the patient in helping to secure quiescence of the disease before admission to sanatorium, and it also assists the tuberculosis officer materially in his recommendation as to the type of institution to which the patient should be transferred. In the investigation, also, of doubtful cases, the temperature records obtained by the district nurses have done much to aid the tuberculosis officers in their work. Figures showing the routine work done at the Dispensary during the year, are set out on a separate page. LADY ALMONER. A total of 829 visits has been made by the Lady Almoner to homes in the borough. Of these 780 were in connection with cases of Tuberculosis and 49 concerned other patients. Fifty visits have been made to the schools with the object of arranging lectures on health subjects, and in addition numerous other visits have been made to the Labour Exchange and to places of employment in search of work for tuberculosis patients. Four patients were helped to regain their former employment and work was found for three on leaving school. One patient refused work which was found for him and three others gave up after a very short trial. Four patients were recommended to, and accepted by, the Spero Wood Cutting Company. These numbers are small, but the work of attempting to find employment for these patients is difficult and trying, and the Lady Almoner is to be congratulated on the result of her efforts. The handicraft class has been continued and is a source of interest to the members ; a few new members have joined during the year. About 150 articles have been made and sold. This does not include private orders obtained by members themselves. One or two members were most successful in obtaining Christmas orders. A great deal of help has been given both to tuberculous and non-tuberculous patients, and many visits have been paid to Approved Societies on account of difficulties in connection with sickness benefit. Convalescent treatment has been arranged for four non-tuberculous adults, and eighteen women and two children have been sent away in connection with the Woman's Holiday Fund. Forty patients have been helped with clothing. Our thanks are to the Red Cross Society, Invalid Children's Aid Association, Charity Organisation Society, Friends of the Poor and other charitable societies for their unfailing help, and also to the Queen Mary's Needlework Guild for a generous gift of clothing.

LIGHT TREATMENT. The following table shows the work done in the Solarium during 1930 :— No. of Attendances 27,541 No. of Examinations 3,973 Number of New Patients 690 Number of Discharges 854 Number of Maternity and Child Welfare patients under treatment during the year 478 Number of Tuberculosis Patients under treatment during the year 124 Number of all other classes under treatment during the year 571 (The Maternity and Child Welfare patients formed 40.75 per cent. of the total number under treatment and the tuberculosis patients 10.57 per cent.) All patients attending for treatment are recommended by general practitioners or by medical officers of the Maternity and Child Welfare Centres, the Tuberculosis Dispensary or Hospitals. Every patient is examined by a member of the medical staff before and during treatment and a Medical Officer is on duty in the Solarium during nine of the sessions each week. A list of the principal diseases treated, together with the number of new patients for 1930, is given below :— TUBERCULOSIS.

There has been an increase in the number of pulmonary cases compared with last year, and most of these patients showed evidence of lowered resistance and of poor general nutrition. The majority of these improved with treatment, and similar improvement was also noted in the bone and joint cases and to a marked degree in the glandular type of disease. Five cases of lupus were discharged during the year and in every one the result was good. The Solarium is of great value to the Tuberculosis Officers. Not only are excellent results obtained in selected cases of glandular , and bone and joint tuberculosis, but in the course of dispensary work many cases are seen in whom, although there is no definite disease, the general condition is poor. School children form a large proportion of these cases and good results usually follow a course of treatment. In the Maternity and Child Welfare Class 478 patients received treatment during the year. Encouraging results were seen in all the ante-natal cases, and it was again noted that not only did the mother benefit but the unborn child appeared to benefit also. With remarkably few exceptions, good results were obtained with children suffering from rickets, and 54 such cases were discharged cured as against five showing no definite improvement. As was mentioned in last year's report, it is a matter for regret that patients do not always realise the necessity of prolonged treatment and regular attendance. A similar improvement was also noted in the cases of infants suffering from malnutrition and debility, and those suffering from bronchitis also received great benefit from treatment. During the past year many more patients suffering from chronic rheumatic conditions were referred for treatment, and most of these had already received prolonged medical treatment. Of 48 such patients discharged during the year, 37 showed improvement as a result of their treatment. In these cases a cure is not to be expected but our results have convinced us that treatment in the Solarium brings relief from symptoms in most cases, which is greatly appreciated by patients. In the cateogory " malnutrition, anæmia and debility " are included many school children, the majority of whom were referred for treatment from the Tuberculosis Dispensary. Of 204 such cases discharged during the year, 159 showed definite improvement. Many of the children were completely restored to normal health, and in others improvement was recorded in appetite, sleep and general muscular tone ; 45 of these children showed little or no change following treatment. Poor and overcrowded housing conditions undoubtedly have a retarding effect on the growth of children, and these conditions probably account for the failure in certain cases. Very good results were obtained in cases of alopecia. Of 25 cases discharged during the year, 22 showed definite improvement ment, and 9 were completely cured. Five cases of dermatitis were discharged and all showed improvement. Three of these cases, two of the seborrhoeic type, were cured. Nine cases of furunculosis were all improved. A separate table shows the results of those patients who have received treatment at Leysin under the Council's scheme for the treatment of surgical tuberculosis. LEYSIN PATIENTS.

There has been no change of importance in the scheme during the year. Owing largely to the introduction of the Midwifery Scheme at the end of last year there has been an increase in the number of patients attending ante-natal centres, and it has therefore been necessary to provide an additional clinic at each end of the borough. This was foreseen and mentioned as likely to occur in my last Annual Report, and it seems probable that still further clinics may be required in the future. FAIRBY GRANGE CONVALESCENT HOME. The figures show a slight increase in the number of children admitted though the number of adults fell by nine. The arrangement between the Borough Council and the Board of Guardians has now ceased to operate owing to the abolition of the latter body. As the result of a generous bequest made by the late Councillor C. Ince a small, but beautiful oak pavilion, has been erected facing the croquet lawn, and this has been greatly appreciated by the patients : — Number of women admitted 240 Number of babies admitted 118 Number of toddlers admitted 125 MIDWIFERY SERVICE. A somewhat lengthy report on this subject was printed last year. In outline and briefly it was proposed that the Borough Council should :— (1) Pay the fee (or part of the fee) of a midwife on our approved list for attending at home any confinement of a Bermondsey mother; the midwife to act either as a midwife or in cases where a doctor is also in attendance as a maternity nurse. (2) Supply confinement outfits. (3) Arrange from time to time for their lady medical officers to attend post-graduate courses in connection particularly with ante-natal work. The scheme was first put into operation on the 14th December, 1929, the Borough Council paying the whole fee of the midwife and providing the outfit free. Following instructions from the Ministry of Health, the scheme was modified and from the 14th March, 1930 all cases have been assessed according to an approved scale. The subjoined figures are for the complete year and show: — Number of cases booked from Ist January, 1930 to 14th March, 1930 [i.e., before assessment was enforced) 158 Number of cases booked from 14th March, 1930 to 31st December, 1930 484 Number of cases assessed " free " 208 Total number of cases booked during the year 1930 642 An arrangement has now been made and an agreement concluded with the Governors of Guy's Hospital, whereby each case on the Guy's Extern District shall be attended by a midwife (acting as a maternity nurse) as well as by a senior student. This arrangement comes into force on the Ist January, 1931. HEALTH VISITORS.

DENTAL TREATMENT. During the year 6,289 patients attended the two centres, and 5,820 were treated entailing 12,676 attendances. These figures show an increase over those of 1929 of 1,565 patients examined, 1,082 treated and 3,138 attendances. In April, owing to the steady increase in the work, Mr. Shapland (Dental Surgeon) and Mrs. Hodgson (Dental Nurse), both previously part-time officers, were placed upon the permanent staff as whole-time officers, and the number of sessions at each centre was correspondingly increased. The present time-table for both centres will be found on page 79 and 80. In accordance with suggestions submitted by Mr. Grantley Smith certain modifications have been made in the Maternity and Child Welfare scale of charges. As a result of these changes there has been an increase of 339 in the number of women treated as compared with last year. A complete dental X-ray outfit was provided at the Bermondsey Centre in October and has already proved of great value.

The Propaganda Section of the Department which has been in existence for six years shows, as in each previous year, an increase in the amount of work done. The lectures given were, as follows :— Audiences Schools 50 .. 10,960 Clubs and Other Institutions tions 72 .. 10,698 Open Air with Cinema Van 48 .. 17,500 Total 170 .. 39,158 One new film entitled "'Opping'" was produced and added to the library making a total of 18. Two others on "The Germ Theory" and "Tuberculosis" are nearing completion, and will shortly be available for. showing. No new pamphlets or bookmarks were published, but large numbers of the 35 already in use were circulated. During November and December three cinema performances were given in the hall at the Central Baths, Grange Road, to school children. The London County Council kindly allowed us the use of the "School Organisation" for the distribution of tickets and in each case blocks of seats were allocated to the schools, sufficient for the number of tickets applied for. Further performances are being given at the beginning of this year. The programmes, which are composed of films suitable for children, always include one of our own Health subjects. An innovation during the year has been the granting of certificates for Personal Health Hygiene to school children. A class for Elementary Hygiene for Senior Girls was held at Webb Street School. At the end of a recognised course a written examination was conducted by this Department, and of the 38 girls who sat 26 passed and were granted certificates. The girls were highly complimented at this very excellent result by His Worship The Mayor of Bermondsey, when he presented the certificates. It is proposed to give three classes of certificates, i.e., Elementary , Intermediate and Advanced Personal Health Hygiene, and it is hoped with the kind co-operation of the Head Teachers and Teaching Staffs of the schools, to hold regular classes and examinations. For the third year in succession, 2,000 copies of "Better Health "have been distributed each month in the Borough. It is a great pity this number cannot be increased, because now that the publication has become so well known and established, we are constantly receiving enquiries for copies. By special request a copy of each issue is sent to every member of the Council. For some years past the Propaganda Staff has been responsible for taking photographs for medical record purposes, of patients attending the Solarium, and to this has been added during the past year the developing and preparation of dental X-ray photographs. In conjunction, with the British Social Hygiene Council, a public lecture was given in the Central Baths, Grange Road The lecture was advertised and every available seat and standing place was occupied, and in addition, some 400 people were unable to obtain admission These were addressed outside the hall, and a promise made that the lecture should be repeated within the next few days. At the second meeting the hall was again filled to capacity. The British Social Hygiene Council also arranged two series of lectures, one for young men entitled : "The Ways of Life," and another for girls entitled : "Our Minds and Our Bodies." These were held by kind permission of the Libraries Committee in the large Public Hall in the Central Library. In furtherance of the working arrangement with the British Social Hygiene Council, Mr. Bush, the Propaganda Officer, was offered and accepted a seat on the London Committee of the Council. In conclusion, I would like to say that a great deal of the success of the propaganda work in this Borough is due to the enthusiastic voluntary assistance of the staff, by the senior members in giving lectures, and the remainder in acting as stewards and generally assisting at meetings. (50) VIII.—SANITARY ADMINISTRATION. HOUSING. The tables included in this Section of the report show the position of the Borough so far as the housing of the inhabitants is concerned. As I said in my introduction to the report, these conditions provide one of the most serious problems which this Council has to face. With regard to overcrowding, the position so far as it is known to us, is set out in the following table Desiring local accommodation Willing to move to London County Council Estates Overcrowded families 921 281 Other families (not overcrowded) 406 240 Totals 1,327 521 Where overcrowding has been abated, the premises are visited at regular intervals, in order to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance. The following table shows the present condition with regard to insanitary areas:— Area Acreage No. of Premises Population (approx.)

While the Act was pending it was impossible to proceed with schemes initiated under the previous Act. There is no immediate prospect of dealing with the first two areas on the list, though it is anticipated that a start will be made in connection with Leroy Street and Rotherhithe Street (East) areas in 1931. The public enquiry under the 1925 Act, in connectionwith the Rotherhithe Street (West) area was held in July, 1929, but for the reason given above further action was delayed. Under the Housing Act, 1930, this area, i.e., Rotherhithe Street (West) has been split up into eight Clearance Areas as set out above, i.e., Essex Place to Lavender Lane, which were represented afresh at the end of the year. Vauban Street area was also represented at the same time as a clearance area under the new Act, and negotiations for the acquisition of property in connection with both of these areas are now proceeding.

Total number of houses in the Borough 18,596 Number of houses occupied by the working classes 18,450 Under sections 17 and 18 of the Housing Act, 1930, action has been taken in respect of two houses, one house under each of the above sections. Informal action has also been taken in respect of four houses. The total number of Bermondsey families accommodated on the London County Council Estates during the year under report was 161, consisting of 732 persons. Twenty-six of these families were accommodated by the London County Council by direct application, and the balance through the offices of this Council. Forty-four families, consisting of 220 persons, who were living in overcrowded circumstances, were found other housing accommodation by the Borough Council during the year 1930. It will be seen from this summary that continuous attention has been given to this problem. It will also be noted that the Council now owns 568 houses and flats. The amount of work entailed in dealing with these conditions, and in managing the property owned by the Council, has increased so steadily, and to such an extent, that it was decided to establish a separate Housing Department, with Mr. E. C. Freeman, formerly Chief Inspector, as chief of the new department, and Mr. R. E. Helden, formerly Sanitary Inspector, as his assistant. The separation took place on October 7th, 1930.

The work of the Cleansing Department includes the collection of House, Trade and Market Refuse, Street Watering, Scavenging and Gully Cleansing Refuse Collection:- The following vehicles arc engaged in Refuse Collection:— 15 Dennis Motor Refuse Low Loaders on House Refuse. 2 Dennis Motor Refuse Low Loaders on Market and Trade Refuse. Extra Dennis Low Loaders are engaged when the Trade Refuse collections are above the average requirements. The Horse System on House Refuse collection has been entirely superseded by Motor Transport, which works on the continuous system. The first Low Loader leaves the Depot at 7.30 a.m. and the second at 8 a.m. When the second Low Loader arrives on the District to start work, the first Low Loader is filled, and while the first is on its way to the Disposal Works, the second Loader continues the work of loading. On the return of the first Low Loader, the operation of filling continues until the Beat is completely cleared. The whole area of the Borough is cleared bi-weekly, excepting the area contiguous to the City of London in which a daily collection operates. The Low Loader system has been in operation during the past 12 months, and is now giving satisfactory results. The quantity of House, Trade and Market Refuse collected during the year was, as follows: — Disposal Loads tons cwts. qrs.

A larger number of streets are being cleansed at night than in previous years, the additions being mainly in the vicinity of the street markets. The street cleansing has been re-arranged and co-ordinated in order that the scavengers clean up the streets after the Domestic Refuse Collection has taken place. The following vehicles are in use in this section:— One 1,000-gallon Dennis Water Motor. One 1,000-gallon Dennis Gully Motor. One 1,000-gallon Dennis Flushing Water Motor. One 950-gallon Straker-Squire Water Motor. Three L'Acre Motor Rotary Brushes. One Karrier Motor Rotary Brush. Nine horse-drawn Slop Vans. One Gully Van. Thirty-four Orderly Barrows. The above motor vehicles are used by the night staff according to requirements, with the addition of eight horse-drawn slop vans. The following statistics denote the activities of the section:- 51.47 mileage of streets cleansed:— Streets cleansed once daily 25.52 miles Streets cleansed twice daily 5,75 miles Streets cleansed three times weekly 25.95 miles OFFENSIVE TRADES. The offensive trades on the Register are as follows : Fellmongers 3 Fatmelters 3 Glue and size makers 3 Dresser of Fur Skins 6 MORTUARY. Particulars of bodies removed to the Mortuary during the year are, as follows: — Total number of infectious bodies removed 13 Total number of bodies removed 73 An arrangement has been concluded with the local Registrars to supply immediate information of deaths from infectious diseases and cancer. The object of this arrangement is to secure that there is a separate room in which the body can be kept prior to burial. On receipt of the information the home is immediately visited by the Sanitary Inspector, and if suitable arrangements cannot be made at home the body is removed to the Mortuary. STREET MARKETS. The market scheme continues to work smoothly and satisfactorily. Number of Licences in operation 678 Applications on waiting list 24 Income £2,467 3s. 0d.

Hereunder will be found particulars of drainage work, &c , carried out by the Drainage Inspector during 1930: — Drains Tested 431 Intimation Notices served 28 Visits to Underground Conveniences 385 Other Visits 3,035 IX.—FOOD CONTROL. The information contained in this section of the Report is concerned mainly with the work done by the Wharves Inspectors and the Food and Drugs Inspector. One of the Wharves Inspectors is always present when a ship or barge is unloading a cargo of food. This often entails their presence on the Wharves early in the morning or late at night, since the time of berthing varies with the tide There has been a very large increase recently in the amount of food coming in, and this is particularly the case with regard to bacon. UNSOUND FOOD. The general inspection of food in shops and on stalls forms part of the duty of the District Sanitary Inspector The following quantities of food came under the notice of the Inspectors during the year, and being found unfit for human consumption was destroyed:— Weight Description of Food Tons cwts. qrs. lbs. - 2 2 6 Fresh Meat 21 Fresh Fish - 10 1 1 Fresh Fruit 8 1 8 Vegetables 1 2 2 10 Total 3 3 9 11 MILK PREMISES.
