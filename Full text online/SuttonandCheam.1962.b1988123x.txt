Analytical and Consulting Chemist (Part-time) 1 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1962., It has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/63 The estimated population increased by four hundred and fifty to seventy eight thousand, four hundred and thirty. The birth rate was again higher at 14.99 births per thousand of population (15.59 adjusted), compared with 14.13 per thousand of population (14.7 adjusted) in 1961. The birth rate for England and Wales was 18.0 per thousand. The death rate also increased to 12.95 (12.04 adjusted) per thousand of population, as against 12.48 (11.36 adjusted) per thousand of population in 1961. The death rate in England and Wales was 11.9 per thousand. The main increase in deaths was caused by deaths from pneumonia, chronic bronchitis and other diseases (not tuberculosis) of the respiratory system. The only malignant disease to show an increase was cancer of the lung and bronchus. There was no maternal death, for the fourth successive year. The infantile mortality rate was slightly higher at 16.2 per thousand live births in 1962, compared with 15.4 in 1961. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 20.7. There was a lower incidence of infectious diseases, mainly accounted for by a reduction in the number of cases of Measles and Whooping Cough. There was no case of Diphtheria, nor, for the fourth year running, of Poliomyelitis, and it is hoped that this happy state will continue by maintaining or increasing the immunisation and vaccination states. There was one case of Meningococcal Infection, and one case of Typhoid Fever. There was a welcome big reduction in the new cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified in 1962. Nineteen sixty two was a year of change as regards vaccination and immunisation procedure. Emphasis on vaccination against Smallpox was transferred from the first to the second year of life. Sabin oral poliomyelitis vaccine came into supply and operation at the end of March, 1962. Alternative dosage schedules to reduce the number of visits and injections in order to 'absorb' all the various prophylactic agents now in use came into general operation. Housing still remains the Borough's chief problem, but prospects are rather brighter than for many years. Thirty one houses or flats were completed during 1962 and forty two were under construction at the end of the year. Planning was also completed for two hundred and nine units on the Chaucer Road site, on which building will commence early in 1963. In addition, land was acquired at the Gas Works site, for which planning should commence in 1963 for approximately two hundred units. Six families were transferred to new towns, and six to Frimley and Camberley. Twelve families were rehoused from slum clearance areas. 2 During the year further work on the Worcester Park Sewage Works was undertaken and other work planned The Cuddington Way relief soil sewer was completed and work commenced on a contract for soil relief sewers at Stayton Road and Stonecot Hill The water supply of the district was maintained at its usual high standard of purity Excellent co operation cont. nued with the staff of the Sutton District Water Company Towards the end of the year the Minister of Health informed Local Health Authorities in Circular 28/1962 that he was prepared to approve under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, the making of arrangements with Water Undertakers for the addition of fluoride to water supplies which are deficient in it naturally It will be a condition of his approval that the technical aspects of the arrangements have the prior approval of the Minister of Housing and Local Government. Towards the end of the year the Minister of Health informed the Council that the Borough of Sutton and Cheam should be considered as being in the Black Area as regards the Clean Air Act, 1956 In consequence a Technical Assistant was appointed at the end of the year and will take up his duties early n the new yea. The first area to be surveyed was approved by the Council. By far the most important happening in 1962, however, was the acceptance of the Royal Commission's Report on Local Government Reorganisation in the Greater London Area, with modifications and the Government's decision to implement it as from the 1st April, 1965. The Greater London Council and the Councils of the Greater London Boroughs will in fact be elected in April and May 1964 respectively. In conjunction with the Borough of Beddington and Wallington and the Urban District of Carshalton, Sutton and Cheam is to form Borough Number 21. The effect is that Borough 21 will become a local health, welfare and education authority and the children's authority. The Borough will have all the powers of a County Borough with minor exceptions, such as the exclusion of the ambulance service, which will be directly under the control of the Greater London Council, Thus truly will a local authority become responsible for local services and much overlapping of responsibilities eliminated There will be much reorganisation to be done, and not the least problem will be that of dovetailing the staffs of four authorities (in the case of the health services) into one, and getting them housed under one roof for efficient administration. The work of sanitary supervision of the district and of the protection of food was efficiently carried out during the year under the direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector I thank him for his helpful collaboration and report, and also the inspectorial clerical and outdoor staff of the Health Department for the work they have done during the year. My work has again been facilitated by he continued co-operation from the County staff at all levels, from Hospital and Laboratory staffs, and particularly from the general practitioners of the district. This, too, remains true of the Council Chief Officers and their staffs, who also have provided information used in this report. Finally, Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to express my thanks for the support you have given me during the year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient Servant, JOHN C. BIRCHALL, Medical Officer of Health.

(2) Landlord and Tenant Act, 1962 This Act came into operation on the 1st November, 1962. It consolidates and rationalises existing legislation on the provision and contents of rent books, and contains several new features. The provision of a rent book will in future be obligatory for weekly lettings which are not subject to the Rent Restrictions Acts and irrespective of the rateable value. (3) Consumer Protection Act, 1961 The Oil Heaters Regulations, 1962, made under the above Act, came into operation on the 1st June, 1962. They impose requirements to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury in relation to domestic space heaters which burn paraffin oil, and are not designed for use with a flue. HEALTH EDUCATION Health education continued during the year as part of the normal duties of all members of the staff during their routine visits and day to day work. In addition, the following special, subjects were dealt with:- (i) The Medical Officer of Health served as a member of a panel, with the staff of the Central Council for Health Education, at a Brains Trust entitled 'The Role of Women in the Promotion, of Health', sponsored by the Mayor and held in the Large Public Hall. The audience was composed of representatives from various women's organisations in the town, who submitted many interesting topics for discussion. The Medical Officer of Health also gave a talk to a local political organisation. (ii) New posters on Venereal Diseases were distributed in November for display in public conveniences and railway station conveniences. Several posters were received from the Ministry of Health on Smoking and Lung Cancer, and were widely distributed to public notice boards, offices, works, youth organisations, hospitals, general practitioners, etc. Assistance was also given in publicising two anti-smoking clinics to the general practitioners of the Borough One clinic started at St. Helier Hospital in May 1962, and the Hospital was prepared to hold clinics at special times had the numbers justified such a course The second was started at Belmont Hospital in July Unfortunately both these clinics were badly supported. 7 (iii). Articles were written by the Medical Officer of Health in a Ratepayers Gazette on 'Smallpox' and 'Fluoridation' (iv) In March the Medical Officer of Health attended a one day Conference run by the Central Council for Health Education at Purley on Methods of Health Education in Urban Areas.' (v) The Sutton and Cheam Home Safety Committee continued to provide education on safety in the home under its President Alderman Mrs, D. Sparks, M.B.E, and Chairman, Mr L. Powers Wallis. The Secretary is Mrs. I.L. Ashmore, 243 Brighton Road, Belmont (Tel Vigilant 5474). During 1962 Water Safety was formally, made part of the Committee's responsibility by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents Publicity in the main followed the Quarterly Planning Guide and many thousands of leaf lets, pamphlets and book marks were distributed and posters were displayed. The local press co operated well in giving publicity to the work of the Committee Figures for local home accidents were sent to the papers quarterly In addition a special article was inserted in the local papers just before Christmas about common accidents at this time of year and a furthar four articles are to follow in the early months of the coming year A water safety poster painting competition was held for schools and a demonstration of domestic and commercial fire extinguishers was held Speakers were provided for various local organisations on different aspects of home safety. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS One hundred and thirty eight medical examinations of staff were undertaken during the year, consisting of one hundred and nineteen for Superannuation purposes and nineteen sick pay cases for reports to the Establishment Committee. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE: ACTS, 1948 and 1951 Section 47 (Removal of P ersons in Need of Care and Attention) (a) One old lady was dealt with under this Section of the Act, She was aged eighty nine and was senile and very chesty and was refusing all assistance and treatment Her sons were, very concerned about her She was removed to hospital, and died three days later. Nineteen other old people were brought to notice during the year as possibly being in need of pare and attention and of these, four were admitted to hospital, two to old people's homes, one went to live with relatives, and twelve managed at home with various types of assistance In addition eleven old people were followed up from previous years, of whom one died, one was admitted to hospital, one removed to live with relatives, and eight continued at home. (b) General Towards the end of the year an Old People's Welfare Committee for Sutton and Cheam, a voluntary committee, was instituted to co-ordinate the work of the existing voluntary old people's welfare committees within the Borough The Medical Officer of Health accepted an invitation to become a member of the Executive Committee Schemes already in operation include Meals on Wheels, Chiropody and a visiting service New schemes under consideration include housing and a day centre. 8 Section 50 (Burial and Cremation of the Dead) Two burials were arranged under the powers granted to the Council by this Section. MORTUARY During 1962, two hundred and twenty three bodies were admitted and underwent post mortem examination. Seventy seven of the bodies were admitted from hospitals, and thirty nine from other local authority areas. The mortuary duties imposed some strain on the (shared) cemetery staff during the year. Consideration was given to the appointment of a full time attendant, but no decision to employ such a person at present was taken during the year It had been proposed to build a house for this attendant near the mortuary, but this was then deferred for a year. A new hydraulic mortuary trolley was received in September and proved much simpler in operation. LABORATORIES The Public Health Laboratory Epsom served the Borough for bacteriological examinations. This service is supplemented by the use of the laboratories at Sutton and Cheam Hospital and St. Helier Hospital. Approximately one hundred and eighty nine specimens connected with infectious diseases were submitted to the laboratories during the year. CLINICS Details of the clinics available in the district are given at the end of this report (Pages 53 and 54) SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water, supply is mainly derived from the deep wells in the chalk of the Sutton District Water Company situated at Sutton, Cheam and Woodmansterne. A small area in the North Ward is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water from all the wells of the Sutton District Water Company is softened to under nine degrees of hardness. A high dose of chlorine in the form of chloramine is administered to the water as a protective measure. Most of it is removed later, leaving a small residual chloramine to pass out to public distribution .The water is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. Samples of the raw and treated waters are examined daily by the laboratory at the Sutton Works. Samples are also examined at monthly intervals by the Company's Consultant Analyst, and copies of his reports are received. Twenty four bacteriological and twelve chemical samples are taken annually by the. five District Councils in the area of supply (two bacteriological and one chemical per month in rotation) All samples were satisfactory. 9 The supply from all sources has been satisfactory in quality and quantity. No action was necessary in respect of contamination during the year All the dwelling houses have a direct supply from the public mains, as follows:- (a) Twenty six thousand and eight houses, with a population of seventy eight thousand four hundred and twenty one are supplied to a tap directly info the house. (b) Five houses with a population of nine are supplied by stand-pipes. The Sutton District Water Company supply twenty five thousand five hundred and seventy five dwellings and the remaining four hundred and thirty eight dwellings are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The following is an average monthly analysis:- Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Bright with a slight white deposit of minute particles of calcium carbonate Appearance Turbidity Less than 3 Colour Nil Odour Nil pH 8.8 Free Carbon Dioxide Absent Electric Conductivity 280 Dissolved Solids dried at 180 C. 215 Chlorine present as Chloride 20 Alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate 50 Hardness (grains per gallon) Carbonate 3.5 Non-carbonate 45 Total 8 0 Nitrate Nitrogen 11 Nitrite Nitrogen Absent Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.13 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.000 Oxygen Absorbed 0.05 Residual Chlorine 0.15 Metals - Iron, Zinc, Copper and Lead Absent Bacteriological Results No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 3 days at 20°C 0 No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 1 day at 37°C. 0 Presence of Bacillus Coli in 100 ml. 0 10 Swimming Baths. There are two public swimming baths in Sutton and Cheam. The Malden Road Bath, Cheam, was opened in 1938,and so is reasonably modern. It is Open between April and September, and in Winter it is converted into a fine public hall. The Throwley Road Bath Sutton is much older and has changing cubicles round the sides of the bath It is open all the year round. Maiden Road Bath Throwley Road Bath Maximum Clothes Accommodation 312 250 Quantity of Water 150,000 gallons 70,000 gallons Treatment Cycle Time 3½ hours 3½ hours Both work on a continuous cycle of pressure filtration and chlorination the actual water being emptied out once a year and the Baths being refilled with mains water. Records are kept at both Baths showing the number of bathers, water temperature and residual chlorine levels at various times during the day and from these it was clear that an adequate degree of chlorination was being maintained. Four bacteriological samples were taken from both the Throwley Road Bath and the Malden Road Bath All eight samples were reported as satisfactory. In addition there is an open air learner swimming bath at Avenue Road County Primary School, Belmont Rise, Belmont. A small pressure filter and chlorinator was in use and a complete circulation of water was obtained every eight hours Three samples of the water were taken for bacteriological examination, and were found to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE, SEWERAGE AND REFUSE COLLECTION Worcester Park Sewage Works. The excessive accumulation of grit has been cleared from the secondary digestion tank and work has proceeded on removal of the old tank mechanism and heating coils. Arrangements have been made for an external sludge heating plant to be erected for this secondary tank. The contract for the Low Level pumping station, rising mains, diversion of' incoming sewers and preliminary treatment unit was commenced in August and the works covered by this contract are expected to be in operation by mid-1963. The contract for the construction of the generating station, workshops, stores and mess rooms has been finalised and work on the site is scheduled to commence in January, 1963. The contract for the first stage of the sludge drying beds scheme will be advertised early in 1963. Design work is proceeding on the reconstruction of the filter beds and the additional humus tanks. The effluent being discharged to the Beverley Brook is of reasonable quality pending completion of reconstruction. 11 Sutton Sewage Works. During the year minor improvements have been made to the treatment units generally. The effluent discharged to the Py1 Brook is normally of good quality. Closet Accommodation. There is only one cess pool in use in the Borough, and one septic tank. During the year a cesspool, not shewn in our records, was found to be in use at a local church. This cesspool was abolished and the vestry's soil drains connected to the Council's sewer. Since 1928 one hundred and sixty three premises, originally with cesspool drainage, have been connected to sewers. Only two pail closets and three chemical closets are in use not including those in temporary use on new building sites. Drainage The Cuddington Way relief soil sewer has been completed and work has commenced on a contract for soil relief sewers at Stayton Road and Stonecot Hill. The Stayton Road relief sewer will overcome flooding difficulties which have occurred in Pylbrook Road and Sorrento Road areas. Rivers and Streams. The streams within the Borough have been maintained in a satisfactory condition. Refuse Collection and Cleansing The scheme which commenced in 1960 for the haulage of refuse from the areas of both Mitcham and Sutton and Cheam Councils via the Refuse Transfer Station in Oldfields Road, Suttan to the controlled tip at Buckland in the main proceeded satisfactorily throughout the year. 12 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector under Regulation 25(30) of the Public Health Officers Regulations 1959 (Pages 13 to41) RECORD OF INSPECTIONS MADE, COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED AND NOTICES SERVED Visits Advisory: Housing & Public Health: Special Inspections 1,291 Bakehouses 10 Butchers: Grocers: Greengrocers: Fishmongers etc. 1,265 Cinemas: Theatres, Halls 12 Clean Air Act: Smoke observations: Deposit gauges: Volumetric etc. 442 Dairies: Milk Purveyors 36 Factories: Workplaces 635 Food & Drugs Act sampling 206 Food Poisoning enquiries 49 Hairdressers: Barbers premises 82 Heating Appliances (Consumer Protection Act, 1961) 4 Hospitals: Schools - spraying of kitchens 6 Houses in multiple occupation 81 Ice Cream: Manufacture, storage and sale of 153 Ice Cream sampling (Bacteriological) 150 Infectious Diseases 279 Licensed Public Houses 22 Merchandise Marks Act 198 Milk: Water sampling (Bacteriological) 121 Miscellaneous 1,511 Outworkers premises 77 Overcrowding: Permitted numbers 255 Pet Animals Act 18 Rag Flock Act - Re-inspections 2,573 Restaurants: Cafe Kitchens, Dining Rooms etc 110 Rodent Control Inspections 7,443 School and Public Conveniences 58 Schools: Industrial Canteen Kitchens 42 Shops under Shops Act 760 Spraying of premises - various insect pests 14 Stables: Passages: Piggeries: Ditches 81 Verminous premises 15 Total 17,999 Number of complaints received and investigated 451 Premises at which defects or nuisances were discovered 1,492 Number of defects or nuisances discovered 1,974 „ „ „ „ „ remedied 1,648 „ „ „ „ „ in hand 244 „ „ „ „ „ outstanding 82 Number of informal notices served 390 Statutory Notices were served as under:- Public Health Act 1936, Section 24 15 „ „ „ „ 39 - „ „ „ „ 45 1 „ „ „ „ 75 - Sutton & Cheam Corporation Act 1951 Section 42 1 Total 17 13 SUMMARY OF REMEDIAL WORKS AND SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT Drainage and Sanitary Fittings:- Number of houses and other premises redrained 7 Number of houses and other premises connected to soil and/or surface water sewers 1 Repairs and amendments to existing drains (1,267 feet laid) 57 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed (involving 1,018 premises) 400 Sanitary fittings repaired/renewed/provided or cleansed 256 Water service pipes/cisterns/repaired/renewed or cleansed 5 Water, smoke and chemical tests applied 138 W.

Remedy of Defects During the Year without Service of Formal Notices:- Number of defective dwelling-houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 246 3. Action under Statutory Powers During the Year:- (A) proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act, 1957:- (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs (2) Number of dwelling-houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices:- (a) By Owners - (b) By Local Authority in default of owners - (B) Proceedings under the Public Health Act:- (1) Number of dwelling-houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 2 (2) Number of dwelling-houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:- (a) By Owners 1 (b) By Local Authority in default of owners 1 (C) Proceedings under Section 17 (1) of the Housing Act, 1957:- (1) Number of houses demolished as the result of formal action by the Local Authority - (2) Number of houses demolished as a result of informal action by the Local Authority 10 15 4. Housing Act, 1957 - Section 42 - Clearance Areas 25 to 43 (odd) Maiden Road, Cheam These properties were acquired as a 'Clearance Area' by the Council in 1959. Seven families were rehoused by the Council during 1962, one family found alternative accommodation, and two houses were unoccupied at the time of acquisition. The ten houses in the area were demolished, sites cleared, and redevelopment of the area commenced during the year. 5. Housing Act, 1957 - Section 157 125, 127, 129, 131 and 131a Cheam Common Road and 1, 3, 5 and 7 Woodbine Lane, Worcester Park The Borough Council acquired these properties in 1961, for the purpose of re-development after demolition of the premises. During the year five families were rehoused by the Council, one family found alternative accommodation, and one house was vacated prior to the purchase being made; thus leaving only one house in occupation at the year end. 6. Housing Act, 1961 - Sections 12 to 23 (Part 2) Houses in Multiple Occupation The provisions of the Act came into force on the 24th November, 1961, and the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962 came into operation on the 22nd May, 1962. The Minister of Housing and Local Government Circular No. 16/62: explains that Part 2 of the Act gives local authorities new and greatly strengthened powers to deal with squalid living conditions in houses in multiple occupation. These powers fall into four main groups:- (a) An entirely new power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed, as prescribed in the new Regulations. (b) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and the provision of adequate means of escape in case of fire. (c) A new power for local authorities to carry out works themselves in default and recover the cost. (d) A power, also new; to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house, or part of a house, which is in multiple occupation. In November 1962 the Borough Council approved certain standards regarding the following matters in connection with houses in multiple occupation:- 16 (1) Natural lighting (2) Artificial lighting (3) Ventilation (4) Wdter Supply (5) Personal washing facilities (6) Drainage and sanitary conveniences (7) Facilities for the storage, preparation and cooking of food and for the disposal of waste water. (8) Installations for space heating, or for the use of space heating (9) Provision of means of escape in case of fire (10) Permitted number of occupants of rooms It is estimated there are some 200 houses in the Borough which are multi-occupied, and of the 35 houses already inspected' no squalid conditions were found, but 27 intimation notices were served on the respective owners regarding the provision of additional services and facilities. The Borough Engineer is informed of all cases of houses in multiple occupation which lack satisfactory means of escape from fire, so that appropriate action may be taken after consultation with the fire officer. 7. Housing Act, 1957 - Part IV Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the year-end 55 (2) Number of families dwelling therein 116 (3) Number of persons dwelling therein (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 315 (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 28 (c.) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved 31 (2) Number,of.persons concerned in such cases (i.e. Equivalent number of adults) 106 (d) Particulars of any case in which dwellinghouses have again become overcrowded after the local authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil These figures are based on the known cases of statutory overcrowding, and are obtained from cases discovered during routine inspections of dwellings, applications made for Council housing accommodation, and on information received in the Department, all of which Have been checked by your Inspectorial Staff at the year-end. During the year 255 visits were made to dwelling-houses in respect of overcrowding enquiries and permitted number of occupants. The 31 cases of overcrowding abated were relieved by the following means (a) Rehoused by the Borough Council 14 (b) Reduction in the number of occupants 2 (c) Other accommodation obtained on own initiative 13 (d) Rehoused by other Local Authorities 2 17 8. Grants for the Improvement or Conversion of Houses Section 20 of the Housing Act 1949 empowered local authorities to make grants at their discretion for the improvement of dwellings by the provision of certain amenities. The Borough Council decided to operate the scheme in October 1954. Section 30 of the Housing Act 1961 alters the circumstances in which improvement grants and standard grants may be made under Part II of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1958 and the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959. The following is a summary of applications for grants received and dealt with by the Borough Council up to 31st December 1962, as supplied by the Town Clerk:- Applications Received Discretionary Conversions Standard Total From inception of the scheme to 31st December, 1962 212 31 96 339 During 1962 28 1 24 53 Withdrawn, ineligible or not granted i Frorfi inception 31 15 17 63 During 1962 2 0 6 8 Approved From inception 175 15 75 265 During 1962 24 0 19 43 Outstanding at 31st December, 1962 8 1 2 11 Total grants paid to 31st December, 1962 £35,559. 18s. 1d.

Standard £1,506. 15s. 10d. 18 RENT ACT, 1957 This Act came into operation on the 6th July, 1957 and applies primarily to privately owned property let unfurnished as separate dwellings, but it also affects furnished lettings. The main effect of the Act was to free from rent control houses and flats with rateable values exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District, and the City of London, or over £30 elsewhere in England and Wales, and to allow limited increases in the rents of houses and flats still under rent control. The following summary shews the number of applications received for 'Certificates of Disrepair', and for the cancellation thereof during the period 6th July, 1957 to 31st December, 1962:- (A) Applications for Certificates of Disrepair From 6.7.1957 to end of 1962 1962 only Number of applications received 144 4 Number of decisions not to issue certificates - - Number of applications withdrawn 11 2 Number of decisions to issue certificates 132 1 (a) ifi respect of some, but not all defects 104 - (b) in respect of all defects 28 1 Number of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K) 76 1 Number of undertakings refused by Local Authority under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 1 - Number of certificates of disrepair issued (one application withdrawn after service of Form J) 56 - (B) Applications for Cancellation of Certificates Number of applications received 32 - Number of objections to cancellation received 6 - Number of certificates cancelled 27 - Number of objections to cancellation upheld 5 - Number cancelled in spite of tenant's objection 1 - PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936 - WORKPLACES Inspections Number of written and verbal notices Occupiers prosecuted 61 5 - 19 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Smoke Abatement and Atmospheric Pollution There are but few industrial chimneys in the Borough. 5 complaints of smoke emission were received and dealt with during the year, 2 of these were in respect of bonfires, one in respect of an incinerator, and two from industrial boiler stacks. Grit Deposit Measuring Gauges In conjunction and with the co-operation of the Department of Scientific & Industrial Research, the grit deposit measuring gauges have been maintained and samples collected monthly for analytical examination. The Borough is adequately covered by three grit deposit gauges which are sited roughly 1½ miles apart. The following is a summary of the results obtained during the year:- MONTH Gauge No. 2 Gauge No. 6 Gauge No. 7 Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Rainfall in inches Total Solids (Tons per sq.mile) January 3.70 13.75 4.33 12.12 3.66 8.15 February 0.55 21.64 0.45 9.02 0.43 5.58 March 1.38 12.76 1.34 8.69 1.38 8.48 April 1.77 13.65 1.77 10.25 1.73 9.11 May 1.77 7.42 2.25 7.41 1.58 7.46 June 0.32 7.69 0.43 5.70 0.35 10.70 July 2.72 10.67 2.56 21.38 2.92 9.65 August 1.77 6.16 1.85 7.34 1.65 4.80 September 2.72 8.28 3.15 8.63 2.72 3.84 October 1.59 8.72 1.69 10.30 1.69 6.95 November 1.85 7.85 2.21 9.70 2.01 8.77 December 1.58 8.25 1.57 13.04 1.50 6.21 Yearly Totals 21.72 126.84 23.60 123.58 21.62 89.70 Monthly Average 1962 1.81 10.57 1.97 10.30 1.80 7.47 1961 1.90 9.39 2.01 7.70 1.75 6.98 1960 2.59 10.62 2.79 10.77 2.44 8.97 20 DAILY MEAN CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE A daily record has been kept since the 1st November, 1958 of the amount of smoke or suspended matter and sulphur dioxide in the air by means of a smoke filter and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus installed in Manor Park House. It has long been recognised that a distinction must be drawn between relatively coarse particles of solid matter which are quickly deposited by their own weight, and which comprise most of the particulate matter collected in the deposit guage, and the very fine particles which settle slowly, if at all. These fine particles, commonly referred to as 'smoke', are less than about 20 microns (0.002 cm) in size and consist largely of carbonaceous matter, including tar, produced by the incomplete combustion of coal; some fine ash is also included. It is important to realise that little of this fine material is collected in the deposit guage which in consequence gives no information about pollution by smoke. To obtain such information a smoke filter is necessary. The following table gives a summary of the daily readings taken during the year 1962:- Smoke Concentration (Microgrammes per cu. metre) Sulphur Dioxide Concentration (Microgrammes per cu. metre) Highest Daily Reading Lowest Daily Reading Average Daily Reading Highest Daily Reading Lowest Daily Reading Average Daily Reading January 786 14 135 962 33 197 February 395 14 84 520 19 149 March 449 14 128 559 71 210 April 144 8 44 348 25 104 May 93 6 27 204 18 66 June 38 2 16 258 12 60 July 42 4 17 142 6 37 August 31 3 9 57 6 15 September 56 3 21 187 13 41 October 416 8 92 325 12 98 November 476 8 131 342 12 123 December 1660 6 268 1400 38 234 Whole year 1962 1660 2 ' 81 1400 6 111 1961 1184 1 59.5 1244 3 107 21 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 - BLACK AREAS In June, 1962, the Minister of Housing and Local Government stated that in view of the density of residential property in the Borough and its nearness to London, the Borough of Sutton and Cheam should be regarded as a "Black Area" for the purposes of Circular No. 4/62. In September, 1962, it was agreed in principle to a scheme submitted by the Chief Public Health Inspector for the creation and administration of a proposed area to be known as No. 1 Smoke Control Area. It is expected that the whole Borough should become smoke controlled in about twelve years, according to the progress made. The initial survey of properties in the No. 1 Smoke Control Area will, it is hoped, commence early in 1963. In this connection a technical assistant has been appointed to assist in the fcrmulation of the scheme. 22 INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Sampling:- During the year two hundred and nineteen samples (comprising fifty-two formal and one hundred and sixty-seven informal samples) were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis as follows:- Type of Sample Number of Samples Examined Unsatisfactory Samples Pormal Informal Total Formal Informal Total Almond Flavouring Essence Concentrated - 1 1 - - - Almonds, ground - 2 - - - - Anti-pasto - 1 1 - - - Apricot Chutney - 1 1 - - - Argentees - 1 1 - - - Aspic Jelly Powder - 1 1 - - - Aspirin - 1 1 - - - Baby Foods (Veal Dinner) - 1 1 - - - Beef Bone Broth - 1 1 - - - Beef & Kidney Pie - 1 1 - - - Bicarbonate of Soda - 1 1 - - - Biscuits (Butter Puff) - 1 1 - - - Blackcurrant Vit.

Cautioned The suppliers withdrew the article from sale, and informed the packers in South Africa. 3155 (Informal) Pork Sausage Roll Labelling Infringement This article contained more than two ingredients which were not specified on the label contrary to the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. Cautioned The Manufacturers were informed, but as there appeared to be some doubt regarding the infringement, it was decided not to pursue the matter further at present. 3227 (Informal) Whole Orange Drink Labelling Infringement On analysis this article was found to contain only 3% of potable orange fruit, although the label described it as "Whole Orange Drink" Cautioned The suppliers withdrew the article from sale, and the manufacturers were requested to amend the misleading label. Sampling Observations It will be seen from the detailed classification that the two hundred and nineteen samples taken during the year were found to be genuine, and only 1.37% infringed the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. For comparative purposes the figures for 1961 were 1.4% not genuine and labelling infringements accounted for a further 2.77% making a total of 4.17%. The pattern of sampling has followed that of previous years in that a wide range of commodities have been covered. The results were most satisfactory especially as the three infringements found were of a minor character. Public Analyst's Comments, 1962 These comments are being written at a time when Consumer Protection is very much in the news and when the new Consumer Council, recommended by the Molony Report in 1962, is about to be formed. The Report makes very interesting reading and no doubt pinpoints many spheres where some protection would be necessary. It is instructive to note, however, that as far as food is concerned the public have received such protection 26 for something like 100 years through the activites of their local Food and Drugs Authorities and with the help of, amongst others, a small band of public analysts dedicated to the work. There is no suggestion in the Report that the Englishman's Food is not amply safeguarded. The year 1962, has seen the passing of the revised and very up-todate Preservatives in Food Regulations whjch considerably extend the number and scope of permitted preservatives. With the modern way of living the use of these and other additives would appear to be inevitable, much as we may personally deplore it; and it is a trend which is world wide. In this country we rely on the passing of Government Regulations to control the number of such additives and to restrict them to definite categories and permitted lists of chemicals which are only approved after applying the most thorough tests that science can devise. Such Regulations have been following one and other rapidly during the last few years and it is the duty of the public analyst to ensure that any additions which are made to food are on the permitted list and restricted to any maximum quantities laid down. Considerable research must sometimes be carried out before satisfactory methods of doing this are devised and an ordinary member of the public would often be amazed at the amount of work which must be done on a sample before the public analyst can certify it as 'genuine'. The comprehensive scheme of sampling carried out by the Public Health Department of Sutton and Cheam ensures the protection of the individual consumer in the Borough in a way which is unspectacular, but none-the-less thorough and efficient. MILK SUPPLY Food and Drugs Act, 1955 The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 The Borough of Sutton and Cheam is a specified area for the purpose of the Milk (Special Designation) (Specified Areas) Order 1951, therefore all milk sold in the Borough is designated milk. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 came into force on the 1st January, 1961 in respect to dealers' licences. These regulations consolidated and re-enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. The principal changes are:- (a) Dealer's licences (except for a few kinds granted by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) are granted by the food and drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is pasteurised, sterilised, or sold, as the case may be; dealers' licences permit sales,oufside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority, and supplementary licences are now discontinued. (b) A dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence has been introduced which permits the sale of all three kinds of specially designated milk, where the milk is obtained by tlje dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer. 27 (c) The period for which a dealer's licence will be granted has now been extended from one year to five years. All milk distributors in the Borough are licensed to use the special designation in relation to the milk retailed. Routine inspections of the milk pasteuriser's and distributors' premises reveal that the provisions of the regulations are generally well observed. Four licences were issued in 1962, authorising the use of Special Designations and these will expire on the 31st December, 1965 along with previous licences issued from 1961 onwards, (as mentioned in (c) above). The total now issued being 51 as follows:- 1961 1962 Total Dealer's pre-packed Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised and Sterilised 27 - 27 Tuberculin Tested, and Pasteurised 1 - 1 Tuberculin Tested 1 - 1 Pasteurised and Sterilised 2 1 3 Pasteurised 3 2 5 Sterilised 11 1 12 Dealer's Tuberculin Tested 1 - 1 Dealer's Pasteurisr's 1 - 1 Total 47 4 51 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES One hundred and five samples of milk were examined as follows:- Class of Milk Number of samples examined Type of Test applied Results Passed Failed Void Pasteurised 55 Phosphatase 55 - - Methylene Blue 50 - 5 Sterilised 8 Turbidity 8 - - Tuberculin Tested 18 Phosphatase 18 - - (Pasteurised) Methylene Blue 17 - 1 Tuberculin Tested 24 Methylene Blue 20 2 2 (Farm Bottled) TOTALS 105 95 2 8 To comply with the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, samples of ' Pasteurised' and 'Tuberculin Tested' Milk on arrival at the testing laboratory shall at once be removed from the insulated container and stored as follows:- 28 (a) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st May to 31st October, inclusive, shall be kept at atmospheric shade temperature until 9.30 a.m. on the following day (b) A sample taken at any time during the period from 1st November to 30th April, inclusive, shall be kept in its original container, or in a sterile 3oz sample bottle at atmospheric shade temperature until 5.0 p.m. on the day of sampling and thereafter at a constant temperature of 650F 2°F until 9.30 a.m. on the following day. The Methylene Blue test shall be begun between 9.30 a.m. and 10.0 a.m. on the day after the sample is taken, but the test shall NOT be be applied if during the period of storage at atmospheric shade temperature this temperature at any time exceeds 70°F. The test shall be deemed to be satisfied'by milk which fails to decolourise methylene blue in thirty minutes. Two samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) Milk failed the test. The dairy companies concerned were notified immediately of the failures in order that the matter could be taken up with the responsible producers as speedily as possible. The eight void samples of 'Pasteurised' and 'Tuberculin Tested' Milk were not subjected to the Methylene Blue Test because the atmospheric shade temperature had exceeded 70°F during the reguired storage period as mentioned above. The 'Phosphatase' test for Pasteurised Milk shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which gives a reading of l0jug or less of p-nitrophenol/ml of milk. Seventy-three samples were subjected to this test and found to be satisfactory. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MILK AND CREAM SAMPLES MILK Forty-four formal and twenty-two informal samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis; all were found to be genuine. Seventeen samples of 'Channel Island' Milk contained satisfactory averages of 4.5% milk fat and 9.03% milk solids other than milk fat: forty-eight other samples of milk contained satisfactory averages of 3.58% milk fat and 8.72% milk solids other than milk fat; and in addition one sample of separated milk was found to be satisfactory. The results were well above the minimum standard of 4% milk fat laid down in the Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956, and of 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milkfat reguired under The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939 29 CREAM Analysis of eight informal samples of cream showed four double cream samples to contain an average of 51.5% milk fat and four single cream samples a satisfactory average of 22.4% milk fat. The minimum standards in relation to cream are as follows 'double cream' not less than 48% by weight of milk fat; and 'other creams' described as single cream, pouring cream, coffee cream, fruit cream, or as any other description of cream - not less than 18% by weight of milk fat. ICE CREAM Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Ice Cre(am (Beat Treatment ejtc.) Regulations, 1959 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 Registrations: During the year seven applications for the registration of premises for the sale and storage of ice cream were received and granted. At the end of 1962 a total of one hundred and seventy-seven premises had been registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, and on two of these premises ice cream could be manufactured. BACTERIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM During the year seventy-five samples of ice cream were obtained for bacteriological examination and provisional grading. The following table shows the 1962 percentage results in each grade and for comparative purposes the results obtained in 1961.

CHEMICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 came into operation on the 27th April, 1959, and replaced the Order of 1953. The regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice. The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent. The reguirement in the 1953 Order that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. Alternative standards are prescribed for certain descriptions of ice cream containing fruit., fruit pulp or fruit puree. The standard of composition for ice cream is as follows;- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7½% milk solids other than fat. (b) Ice cream containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall either conform to (a) above or, alternatively the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole including the fruit etc. and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½% fat and 2% milk solids other than fat. (c) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat (except as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7½ milk solids other than fat, (d) Milk Ice or Milk Ice containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall contain not less than 2½% milk fat and no other fat ( save as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. 31 12 samples of locally produced ice cream were submitted to chemical examination during the year and found to contain constituent percentages above the prescribed standard, as under:- Sample No. Constituent Percentages Fat Milk Solids other than fat 3122 5.5 9.4 3153 5.3 9.2 3169 11.5 13.0 3182 11.3 12.6 3197 5.6 9.5 3210 5.9 8.8 3211 13.3 15.0 3223 10.9 11.5 3224 10.7 12.5 3238 5.6 15.0 3249 5.8 16.8 3250 11.2 15.6 Average 8.55 12.41 ICE LOLLIES BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION There is no prescribed standard for water ices or ice lollies sold as . such, but as in former years ice lolly samples have been submitted to a test similar to the one applied to ice cream. Thirty-six lollies were examined and found to be satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These regulations which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960, amend and consolidate the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957. A number of amendments have been embodied in the general provisions of the Regulations in the light of the experience gained since they first came into operation. The most important of these amendments are described belowi- (a) The term "catering business" has been introduced into regulations 25(2) (temperature at which certain foods are to be kept) and 28(1) (supply of water to stalls), in order to indicate more clearly the type of business to which these requirements apply. (b) The definition of "meat" has been extended to include rabbits, game and poultry. (c) The scope of the expression "handling of food" is widened so. that the obligation of food handlers will in f uture extend to persons who wash up or clean food equipment. 32 (d) Herbal smoking mixture and snuff are now included with tobacco, which a person engaged in the handling of food shall refrain from using whilst he is handling open food or is in any food room in which there is open food. (e) Regulation 26 as amended makes it clear that food transport and delivery vehicles have to be kept clean and in good condition, and suitably and sufficiently lighted when being cleaned. A proviso has been added to permit the driving compartment of a stall or vehi cle to be used as a sleeping place if it is effectively separated from the food compartment. The following is a summary of the number of food premises in the Boroughs- Bakehouses 12 Butchers (including one horseflesh shop) 59 Confectioners (sugar and flour) 180 Fishmongers/Stalls/Fried Fish Shops 26 General Stores/Shops 13 Greengrocers/Stalls/Stores 86 Grocers 132 Ice Cream (Manufacture and sale of) 177 Licensed Public Houses 33 Milk Purveyors/Qepots/Dairies 39 Restaurants/Cafes/Snack Bars/Dining Rooms 63 School and Industrial Canteens/Kitchens/ Service Rooms 46 Other Food Premises 15 TOTAL 881 During the year 1606 visits were made to food business premises, 107 notices were served in connection with the 265 infringements discovered as detailed in the following table:- Food Hygiene Regulations Number of Infringements found in 1962 Number of Infringements rectified in 1962, (including infringements discovered in 1961, but rectified in 1962) Regulation No. 5 6 5 " 6 18 16 " 8 12 10 " 9 8 9 " 10 - - " 12 - - " 14 63 67 " 15 14 15 " 16 15 16 " 17 6 3 " 18 4 2 " 13 12 11 " 20 1 4 " 21 - - " 23 93 62 " 24 8 7 25 1 3 " 26 4 4 " 28 - - " 29/30 - - TOTAL 265 234 33 It is gratifying to record that the majority of the traders continue to show a willing co-operation to comply with the requirements of the Regulations. Mention must also be made that the standard of hygiene in the various food premises and the cleanliness of the persons engaged in the handling of food is much improved, but constant vigilance is necessary. Prosecutions (a) Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to 1960 No proceedings were taken during the year under these Regulations. (b) Food and Drills Act, 1955 Proceedings were taken- under Section 2 of the Act for selling to the prejudice of the purchaser food not of the substance demanded, as follows:. (a) Selling five unwrapped 'Hovis' loaves contaminated with bird droppings (two of which had been partly eaten by birds) Fine: £7. 0. 0. with £5. 5. 0. costs. (b) Selling mixed salad containing a piece of glass Fine: El5. 0. 0. with £5. 5. 0. costs. In addition one case was pending at the year end in connection with selling a loaf of bread contaminated with mineral oil. Complaints Regarding Food Unfit for Human Consumption The following is a summary of various complaints received and investigated during the year. The general circumstances in these cases did not warrant legal proceedings being taken, but each case was considered on its merits and appropriate action taken as found to be necessary.

Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 One licence to act as a slaughterman was granted in 1962 to the R.S.P.C.A. Inspector. Bakehouses There are twelve bakehouses in the Borough, With one exception, all are provided with mechanical power. The standard of cleanliness and sanitary conditions in the majority of cases were found to be satisfactory as revealed by the visits of inspection made during the year. Shops Act 760 visits were made to various premises under the Shops Act and revealed that the arrangements made for the health and comfort of the shop workers are in the majority of cases satisfactory. Schools The sanitary conditions and the water supply to the Schools in the area were found to be generally satisfactory. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises There are seventy-five establishments in the Borough. 82 inspections were made during the year. The premises generally were found to conform to the requirements of the Hairdressers and Barbers Bye-laws, 1947. 36 Merchandise Macks Act One hundred and ninety-eight visits were made to food premises under this Act. The infringements discovered were principally in connection with the marking of imported apples, tomatoes and dead poultry. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The intention of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling material in upholstered articles, and other articles which are stuffed or lined. The Act provides for the registration of certain premises by the Local Authority on payment of a registration fee and the licensing of certain other premises on payment of a statutory fee. No applications to store rag flock were received during the year. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952, and provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. 18 visits of inspection were made during the year. Seven licence renewal applications were received and granted during 1962. Licensed Places of Public Entertainment There are seventeen licensed places of public entertainment in the Borough. They are used mainly for cinematograph shows, concerts, dancing and social functions. The general standard of cleanliness was found to be well maintained. Licensed Public Houses 22 visits of inspection were made to the 33 licensed public houses in the Borough. As a result of inspections under the Food Hygiene Regulations a considerable number of improvements have been carried out at many public houses. These include the provision of additional or improved sanitary conveniences, washbasins, hot water supply, improved ventilation to kitchens, bars and cellars, and the more general use of detergents and sterilising agents for the washing of utensils, beer pipe lines and pumps. 37 The Consumer Protection Act, 1961 Four visits were made to premises from which heating appliances were sold. This involved the carrying out of tests on the many types and designs of heaters offered for sale. No infringements of the Act were discovered. Noise Abatement Act, I960 Under Section 1 of this Act which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part 111 of the Public Health Act, 1936- Local Authorities will under this procedure be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of the premises on which it arises and if the notice is not complied with it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court. Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. (except in special circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment with the exception that between noon and 7 p -m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are for sale. The loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. Three complains of noise were investigated and satisfactorily dealt with during the year. Disinfection and Disinfestation Council Houses Private Houses Other Premises Number of premises treated with insecticide for bugs arid fleas 1 5 1 Ten hospital kitchens were sprayed for flies, ants and moths. The insecticides used were Pybuthrin, D.D.T. Residual and Municipal Spray, Gammexane Liquid Spray, Zaldecide M. Powder and Fumex Fumigators. 38 RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 19U9 A. Surface Treatments (1) 6554 visits were made during the year by the Rodent Operator and 889 by the Public Health Inspectors to premises infested or possibly harbouring rats or mice. 461 premises were cleared of rats or mice and no major infestations were recorded. (2) The work for the year is generally summarised as under:- Complaints received or cases discovered and investigated 459 Number of premises found to be infested 415 Number of premises where no evidence of rodents found 44 Number of premises cleared of rats or mice (including 74 previous year's cases) 461 Number of premises still being trteated at the year end 28 (3) The cause or site of infestation at the 415 infested premises was:- Keeping of poultry 5 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - rats 22 Inside premises (under floors etc.) - mice 38 Buries, scrapes etc., in gardens, land etc. 220 Under or inside sheds 124 Defective drains 6 Total 415 (4) Type of premises found to be infested:- With Rats With Mice Total Council Property 8 4 12 Dwellinghouses 337 15 352 Business premises, etc. 23 14 37 Schools, Hospitals, Canteens etc. 1 7 8 Land 6 - 6 Total 375 40 415 (5) Summary of the type of premises and methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice:- Type of premises cleared:- Dwellinghouses (mainly in gardens) 379 Food shops and food premises 21 Non-food shops 4 Waste land and building sites 8 Hospitals and Schools 19 Factories and Workplaces 11 Council Premises (other than dwellings) 10 Miscellaneous 9 Total 461 39 Methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice, were as follows:- Warfarin and other Poison Baits 458 Rat and Mouse Proofing - Drains repaired 3 Total 461 B. Sewer Treatments (1) Treatment No. 30 - Second Maintenance Treatment (1961-62) The second maintenance treatment of soil sewer-manholes in the area found to be infested during the previous treatment was completed on the 30th March, 1962. Anticoagulant poison - Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was used with pinhead oatmeal, technical white oil, castor sugar, and para-nitrophenol (mould inhibitor) as a bait base. Rebaiting of all infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded. The following is a summary of the results obtained:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited - 1st visit 26 58 61 73 31 249 Complete takes - 2nd visit 3 1 3 - 2 9 Partial takes - 2nd visit 4 1 6 2 4 17 Complete takes - 3rd visit 2 - 3 - 1 6 Partial takes - 3rd visit 2 - 3 - 1 6 Complete takes - 4th visit 2 - 3 - 1 6 Partial takes - 4th visit - - 1 - - 1 Takes - 5th visit - - - - - Nil (2) Test Baiting (1962-63) The Borough was divided into five sections, as in previous tests, and a test baiting of 10% of the soil sewer manholes carried out from the 20th to 25th August, 1962. All the manholes baited were checked three days after the baits had been deposited, with the following results:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited - - 48 112 55 215 Complete takes - - 4 7 - 11 Partial takes - - 1 10 1 12 Baits not taken - - 43 93 54 190 Baits washed off - - - 2 - 2 40 (3) Treatment No. 31 - First Maintenance Treatment ( 1962-63) This treatment was confined to the sections proved to be infested by the annual 10% test baiting, and operations were completed on the 19th October, 1962. Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was again used, as this poison is harmless to the operators using it and a more positive result is anticipated by the complete eradication of rats in the sewers treated. Hebaitingand examination of the infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded.

Section E Worcester Park All roads West of Stonecot Hill and London Road. 41 INCIDENCE OF'AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES Fiye hundred eases of notifiable diseases, other than tuberculosis, were notified during 1962 compared with.ane thousand, two hundred and sixty eight'cases in 1961, and three hundred and sixty seven in I960 Scarlet'Fever Thirty cases were notified in 1962 as against forty nine in 1961. There were nine cases in the first quarter, eight.in the second quarter, two in the third quarter and eleven in the fourth quarter The illness was generally mild and there' were- no deaths The less exacting control of Scarlet Fever continued. This causes less interference with school attendance of cases and contacts, and is justified whilst the illness remains so mild. Diphtheria No case Was riotifidd during,the year The last case in Sutton and Cheam occurred in 1951. Diphtheria Antitoxin The possibility of Diphtheria must still always be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infections of the throat The early injection of antitoxin is the most effective treatment of Diphtheria, Swabs for diagnosis should be taken before Any antibiotic is administered Any suspected cases are best admitted isolation hospital at once for diagnosis and treatment. Diphtheria Immunisation Diphtheria Immunisation is still Very necessary. Immunisation is safe, simple and effective. Every child should be immunised before the age of twelve months (and if-triple antigen-is used and this is desirable - immunisation sliQuld be started as early as the-third month), with reinforcing doses at appropriate intervals thereafter. Immunisation is free, of charge and can be arranged-through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. During ,1962,.one thousand and fifteen children received a primary course of immunisation as follows:- Children Born in Years 1962 1961 1960 1959 1958 19531957 19481952 Total Number Immunised :- 484 403 20 13 8 75 12 1015 In addition, one thousand, five hundred and ninety five children received reinforcing injections. Measles. Four hundred and twenty two cases were notified in 1962, compared with one thousand, one hundred and forty eight cases in 1961. There was no death. Three hundred and fifty of thecases were notified during the last quarter of the year. 42 The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January 12 July 12 February 4 August 11 March 11 September - April 11 October 4 May 3 November 107 J une 8 December 239 Measles cases must be kept out of school for ten days after the appearance of the rash and may then return if the child is sufficiently well to do so. Contacts are not excluded except the under fives, who should be excluded for fourteen days from the date of appearance of the rash in the last casein the home. However, all contacts should be carefully scrutinised daily before being allowed to go to school, and should be excluded if suffering from a cough, cold, chill or red eyes. No child .whoas known for certain to have had the disease need be excluded The illness can be prevented or modified by the injection of gamma globulin early in the incubation, period. A small quantity is available to doctors for cases of special risk. Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Whooping Cough. Seventeen cases were ^notified in 1962, compared with .thirty four cases in 1961- There was no death. The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January _ July - February 3 August - March 2 September 6 April - October - May 2 November - J une 2 December 2 Whooping Cough is a serious infection in.early infancy. The danger of mortality is highest in the first three months of Life and diminishes with age. Every effort should be made to protect babies and weakly infants from contact with infection. The vaccines give substantial protection. Immunisation should commence not later than three months of age. Cases are excluded from school for twenty eight days from the beginning of the characteristic cough Child, contacts under seven years of age should be excluded for twenty one.days from the date of onset of a case in their home if they have not had the disease. Health Visitors are informed of.notified,cases of children under five years of age so that they, may give advice where, necessary. 43 Immunisation againsi,Whooping Cough Immunisation against Whooping Cough is available free of charge for chi ldren: under five years of,age either through the family doctor or at Child Walfflre.Clinics Three injections are given at monthly Intervals The injections are given either separately or combined with immunisation against Diphtheria or preferably Diphtheria and Tetanus In 1962, nine hundred and twenty five children received a primary course of immunisation In addition, four hundred and nine children were given reinforcing injections during the year Smallpox No case was notified Vaccinauon aga ns Smallpox The speed of travel has increased the risk of Smallpox being imported Our protection depends on vaccination There.is no drug which will cure the illness,, qlthaugh one is under trial Vaccination is recommended in infancy before the age of two years and provides a basal immunity which can be reinforced later with reduced reaction Vaccination is voluntary and, as regwds infants and school children, is free of charge and can be arranged through the family doctor or at the nearest Child Welfare Centre Immunity should be reinforced by re-vaccination between the age of eight and ten years The following table shows the numbers of vaccinations during 1962. which were much higher than in previous years,.owing to the presence of Smallpox in this country in the early part of the year which caused an increased demand Age Number Vaccinated Number Re Vaccinated Under 1 650 - 1 118 - 2-4 230 56 5-14 620 762 Over 15 430 920 Totals 2048 1738 The percentage of babies under the age of one year vaccinated during the year was 57.1, compared with 61 0 in 1961 and 45 i in I960 ' Puerpeital Pyrexia, Eleven cases were notified in 1962, compared with six in 1961. No case occurred at home, Puerperal Pyrexia is any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100 4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage". Tetanus Tetanus immunisation is available free of charge as for Diphtheria and Whooping Cough The tetanus bacillus is present in horse manure and in manured land. Infection enters the body through contaminated wounds and abrasions which may be so slight as to escape notice The object of immunisation is to prepare the tissues in advance to resist the tetanus bacillus Children are prone to abiaeions and should be protected from the incidental risk of infection At.present lis a routine to inject anti:tetanic serum after wounds This,serum occasionally causes undesirable.allergic reactions,and its use. can be avoided by precautionary 44 immunisation with toxoid before injury Immunisation against Tetanus can be given separately , or, in children, preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough and must be sustained by reinforcing injections at appropriate intervals A record of the dates of injection should always be carried on the person During 1962, nine hundred and nine children received primary injections, and five hundred and eighty four children received reinforcing injections It is also very desirable that all who work in agriculture or in stables should be immunised Food Poisoning Five cases were notified in 1962, compared with two cases in 1961 The cases were in one family and were caused by an unidentified agent The illness fallowed attendance at a wedding reception outside the Borough, other guests also being affected The low incidence of infections, due to Salmonellae and Staphylococci in food is satisfactory, Prevention of infection depends on scrupulous cleanliness in the production, storage, manufacture and distribution of food. The washing of hands after use of ,the W.C. is the most effective protective measure against intestinal carriers of infection Early notification of cases of food poisoning necessary so as to obtain the residue of suspected^food for bacteriological examination. No food handler should ever be allowed.to return to work without bacteriological clearance. Dysentery. There was one case of Dysentery in 1962, compared with two cases in 1961, It was of the Sonne type, and occurred in a woman of forty,three. The illness started towards the end of a three weeks' holiday in Ireland. Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious form of gastroenteritis. The infection is spread by faecal contamination of hands, objects, and in particular, lavatory seats. Prevention,depends on the washing ofhands after use of the WC. and on the efficient cleansing of communal W.C s. in,schools and public places. It is most desirable-that all cases, of diarrhoea should be checked bacteriologically. Typhoid and Paraeyphoid Fevers. One case of Typhoid occurred in a woman of twenty five. The infection was obtained by eating cockles when on holiday at a seaside resort, MeningococcaMnfecrion. One case was notified. It occurred in a young lady of eighteen in the first quarter of the year. Poliomyelitis The year 1962 was the fourth successive year the Borough has been free from this infection. The numbers of Poliomyelitis cases and deaths in England and Walles were Approximately one third only of, those for 1961. Sabin Oral Poliomyelitis. Vaccine was introduced towards the end of March and could be used in place.Af theSalk Poliomyelitis Vaccine for the same priority groups.

The death rate was 0.013 per thousand of population, as in 1961. There was no death from non-pulmonary tuberculosis, the same as in 1961. For England and Wales the death rate for pulmonary tuberculosis was 0.059 per.thousand of population and for non-pulmanary tuberculosis 0.007 per thousand of population. The number of new cases pulmonary tuberculosis was fourteen, compared with twenty nine in 1961 and nineteen in I960. Residual foci of infection still persist, particularly among the middle aged and elderly, and intensive search will be necessary to eliminate the disease. The use of B.C.G. vaccine in adolescent children gives a high measure of protection. Five hundred and thirty two children received injections in 1962, and twenty four children were found to be Mantoux positive. The response rate in the thirteen, year age group was 71.1 per cent. Five new cases of non- rpulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1962, compared,with one in 1961 and six in I960. The Sutton and Cheam Tuberculosis and Chest Care Committee continued to provide valuable assistance to patients and their families throughout the year. Theassistance.given is now almost equally divided between tuberculosis cases and chronic, bronchitis dnd other chronic chest cases. Additional nourishment, clothing,.bedding and fuel were provided where necessary. Grants were made to,provide occupational therapy, and holidays were arranged for children,, mother and convalescent patients. The Chairman is Mrs. F- Smyth, J.P. and,the Hon.
