Scabies : Arrangements have been made with Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, for diagnosis and the Joint Isolation Hospital, Uxbridge, for the treatment of Scabies. Application for treatment must be made to this office in the first instance as no application will be accepted except on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health. 13 Water Supply : The whole of the district is supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company, with the exception of the following : Cottages in Field End Road, South Ruislip 4 Cottage, Rayson's Hill, Eastcote 1 5 Reports are received monthly from the Colne Valley Water Company as to the chemical and bacteriological examination of samples of water, and these have proved satisfactory in every case. Bathing Establishments—Ruislip Lido In August, 1946, during a heavy downfall of rain, one of the main sewers became blocked, leading to an overflow of sewage into the stream which supplies the Grand Union Canal Lido at Ruislip. Samples of the water in the Lido were taken from various places, which revealed a heavy pollution of the water with Faecal Coli. Bathing and paddling were in consequence prohibited until further orders. Stream Supplying Lido : After repair of the drain numerous samples were taken from the stream, and this water itself was found to be equally polluted. Further investigation revealed the fact that there existed outside the area stables, the effluent from which discharged straight into the stream. Suggested Remedies : The matter was taken up with the Grand Union Canal Company, who co-operated with the Council wholeheartedly in their efforts to remedy the pollution as far as practicable. It was suggested that a chlorinating plant should be erected at the point where the stream entered the Lido, and that a chlorinating boat should be employed regularly on the Lido itself. Owing to the difficulty in securing machinery, materials and labour, this work could not be commenced before the end of the year 1946. 14 For the information of all concerned I am including in this report, however, the position existing at the present time, namely, June, 1947, at which time the condition of the stables already mentioned had been rectified. Chlorination came into operation in May. In order to show the improvement effected by this means I append details of the Bacteriological Counts after repair of the drain but before chlorination, and after chlorination. Before Chlorination—21-3-47 Faecal Coli. Stream leading to reservoir, northern end 18,000+ per 100 ml. Bathing pool off jetty 10,000+ per 100 ml. Reservoir lake, near beach. 350 per 100 ml. Reservoir lake, far beach 1,000 per 100 ml. After Chlorination—15-5-47. Faecal Coli. Reservoir lake, above chlorinator 110 per 100 ml. Extreme northern end of lake, after chlorinator Less than 1 per 100 ml. Bathing pool off jetty Less than 1 per 100 ml. East side of lake Less than 1 per 100 ml. South east corner of reservoir, near beach 1 per 100 ml. Bathing was again permitted during the Whitsun holidays from 24th May, and samples were again taken with the following results :— After Bathing—27-5-47. Water from stream above chlorinator 11 per 100 ml. Extreme northern end of lake, after chlorinator 35 per 100 ml. Bathing pool off jetty 2 per 100 ml. East side of lake 11 per 100 ml. South east corner near beach 8 per 100 ml. At no time was any pathogenic organism found. 15 It would appear, therefore, that the suggested remedies have proved satisfactory, and that the efforts of the Grand Union Canal Company have resulted in providing for their patrons as safe an outdoor bathing pool as is humanly possible. Samples will continue to be taken throughout the year at stated intervals. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE The whole of the soil sewers in the Council's area discharge into the sewers of the West Middlesex Drainage Scheme. FACTORIES AND OUTWORKERS During the year the Sanitary Inspectors made 69 visits to factories and 11 to outworkers' premises. No serious defects were found, but in many cases improvements were carried out, and there are still several premises receiving attention. INFESTATION DEPARTMENT Throughout the year the Rodent Control Section of the Public Health Department continued to operate. Investigation and disinfestation have been carried out at business premises, private dwellings, Conncil property and refuse tips, which involved 4202 visits. The sewers have been treated by means of a test bait, but no trace of rats in the manholes has been found. 16 SANITARY INSPECTION OF DISTRICT Public Health Acts: Houses inspected for nuisances 846 Offices and Business Premises 8 Verminous premises 24 Caravans 35 Hutment dwellings 5 Ponds, ditches, watercourses, insects, etc. 59 Ruislip Lido, visits and water sampling 53 Animals, pigs, poultry, etc. 30 Yards, passages and footpaths and car parks 189 Other nuisances 214 Water supplies 29 Drainage inspected or tested 792 Infectious disease general enquiries 277 Hospital discharges 105 Schools 3 Camping sites 43 Premises visited for Middlesex County Council for Music and Dancing Licences 24 Cinemas, general visits 8 Housing Acts : Houses, inspections, etc. 578 Houses, measured re Land Registry Searches 905 Premises visited re Building Licences 143 Food and Drugs Act: Foodshops and cafes 196 Bakehouses 20 Unsound food 301 Fish shops 106 Cowsheds and Dairies 13 Food delivery vehicles 12 Slaughtering 3 Milk sampling 22 Ice-cream sampling 39 Shops Acts : Premises visited 32 Factory Acts : Premises visits 69 Outworkers visits 11 Petroleum Acts : Premises visited 8 Riding Establishment Acts : Visits and enquiries 8 Council Houses : Houses inspections 31 Requisitioned Houses : Houses visited 203 Miscellaneous and General Enquiries 332 Premises visited re dustbins 24 Infestation Order Rats and Mice : Visits to Premises by Sanitary Inspectors 29 Rodent Officer 1581 Rodent Operatives 2592 Premises disinfected 86 Bedding and Clothing steam disinfected 73 Informal action 351 Nuisances abated 238 Drainage unstopped—premises affected 628 17 Printed at RAWLINSONS PRINTING WORKS LTD NORTHWOOD MIDDX
