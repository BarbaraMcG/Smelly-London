August 11th, 1950. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Wood Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the year 1949. For the first time for over forty years, the Annual Report this year includes no account of the Maternity and Child Welfare Services provided in the Borough, these being now, like the School Medical Service, the responsibility of the Middlesex County Council. This unfortunate and regrettable division of responsibility for the environmental and the personal health services between two separate local government authorities, is now an accomplished fact, but there is still contact maintained between the two branches of the work, in so far as the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough is for 40 per cent, of his time responsible for the environmental services, while for the remaining 60 per cent, of his time, as area Medical Officer under the County Council, he is in charge of the personal health services. So far as the general health of the community is concerned, the year 1949 has been uneventful. Infectious disease has been rather more prevalent than in the previous year, but in spite of the increased prevalence, no deaths occurred from the commoner infections. For the second year in succession there were no cases of diphtheria, and for the tenth year in succession, no deaths occurred from this disease. The Birth Rate fell from 15.1 per 1,000 of population in 1948 to 13.6 in 1949, but the Death Rate at 11.9 was appreciably higher than that for 1948, which was 9.8, the lowest recorded in the Borough. The Infantile Mortality Rate of 25 per 1,000 live births was the lowest on record in Wood Green, the previous lowest being 27 in 1945. 3 I am very grateful to the chairman and members of the Health Committee for their support throughout the year, and to the members of my staff for their loyal help and co-operation. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, MALCOLM MANSON, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE AREA.

The mid-year estimate of the population supplied by the Registrar-General is 52,780, a decrease of 200 from that of the previous year. BIRTHS. The number of live births registered during the year was 719, which corresponds to a Birth Rate of 13.6 per 1,000 of population. This is a fall from the number of births in the previous year, which was 805, giving a Birth Rate of 15.1. The number of still births was 16 and the Still-Birth Rate 22 per 1,000 births. In 1948, the Still-Birth Rate was 26. DEATHS. The number of deaths credited to Wood Green after the necessary adjustments had been made for inward and outward transfers was 631. This gives a Death Rate of 11.9 per 1,000 of population, which is appreciably higher than the figure for 1948, when the deaths numbered 520 and the Death Rate was 9.8. Of the total of 631 deaths, no fewer than 412 or 65 per cent occurred at ages over 65. 124 deaths occurred at ages over 80 and 18 at ages over 90. The individual causes of death are given in Table III, in the Appendix to this report, and the principal causes of death for 1949 and the previous year are shown below:— Cause of death. 1949 1948 Heart Disease 198 155 Other Diseases of the Circulatory System 28 19 Intra-cranial Vascular Lesions 74 50 Cancer—all sites 121 97 Tuberculosis—all forms 19 26 There were no deaths from the principal zymotic diseases, enteric fever, smallpox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles or whooping cough or from diarrhoea in children under 2 years. 6 INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of infants under 12 months was 18, which gives an Infantile Mortality Rate of 25 per 1,000 live births, the lowest rate recorded so far in Wood Green. The previous best rate was 27.3 in 1945. The Infantile Mortality Rate of 25 per 1,000 for Wood Green compares favourably with that for the country as a whole which was 32, and that for a group of towns of comparable size which was 37. Of the 18 infantile deaths, 7 occurred within 24 hours of birth, and 14 during the first four weeks of life, giving a Neo-natal Mortality Rate of 19. All seven deaths occurring within 24 hours of birth were those of premature babies. The following table shows the causes of death at the various ages under one year:— Cause of Death. Under 1 week. 1 to 2 weeks. 2 to 3 weeks. 3 to 4 weeks. Total under 4 weeks. 4 weeks and under 3 months. 3 months and under 6 months. 6 months and under 9 months. 9 months and under 12 months.

One death occurred as a result of childbirth, the Maternal Mortality Rate being 1.4 per 1,000 births. This death was due to Post-partum Haemorrhage. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Table IV in the Appendix gives details of all the cases of infectious disease notified during the year. The total of 911 notifications shows an appreciable increase over that of the previous year which was 762. Of the total of 911 notifications, 678 or almost exactly three-quarters, were of measles, which was prevalent throughout part of the year. The measles was, however, of a mild type and no deaths resulted. 71 cases of scarlet fever were notified, 57 of whom were admitted to hospital. Among these also, no death occurred. For the second year in succession, no case of diphtheria occurred in Wood Green and for the tenth year in succession, there was no death from this disease. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. During the year, 612 children were immunised for the first time, and 215 children received re-inforcing injections. Immunisation has been carried out regularly in Wood Green for just over twenty years, and the state of immunisation of the child population is, on the whole, fairly satisfactory, although not quite good enough to be an absolute safeguard against the disease. Our records show that 63 per cent, of the children under 5 years of age have been immunised while of children from five to fourteen years, 89 per cent, have been immunised. Poliomyelitis and Polio-encephalitis. Four cases of anterior poliomyelitis and two cases of polioencephalitis were notified during the year, two of the former being children and two adults, while both the cases of polio-encephalitis were adults. All four cases of poliomyelitis recovered, three of them the two children and one adult, without any residual paralysis, but the fourth case, a young married woman, is still in hospital with paralysis of both legs. 8 Of the two polio-encephalitis cases, one a married woman of 32 years had a very severe attack, which proved fatal within a few days. The other, a young man of 18 years, also had a very severe attack, but recovered after a very prolonged illness, and still has extensive paralysis of both legs. Tuberculosis. 95 new cases of tuberculosis were brought to the notice of the Health Department during the year, 86 pulmonary and 9 non-pulmonary. These numbers include 18 transfers from other districts, and show an increase of 21 over the previous year when there were 74 new cases, 65 pulmonary and 9 non-pulmonary. There were 19 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis: 10 male and 9 female, but no deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis. The death rate from tuberculosis was 0.36 per 1,000 of population as compared with 0.49 for the previous year. From the information given in Table V, it will be seen that the heaviest incidence of new cases of Tuberculosis was in the age group from fifteen to forty-five, and among females, was again particularly high, between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five. Tuberculosis remains one of the most serious problems with which a community like Wood Green has to deal. An endemic disease, its prevalence and spread are very closely bound up with factors such as the provision of adequate food and good environmental conditions. So far as treatment is concerned, its success depends very largely on early diagnosis, and with the increasing availability of Mass Radiography, early diagnosis should become more common than it has been. On the other hand, under present circumstances, with a considerable apparent shortage of sanatorium beds, there is no guarantee that early diagnosis will be followed by early treatment, and far too many cases of active tuberculosis have to remain weeks and even months before they can be admitted to hospital or sanatorium. With housing conditions as they are at present, the prevention of the spread of the disease in infected households is extremely difficult and in some cases, quite impossible. Under the Council's housing points scheme, it is the practice to give extra points in individual housing applications for health reasons, and advantage has always been taken of this provision, in the case of families comprising one or more cases of tuberculosis. This provision has been instrumental in enabling several families of this type 9 to obtain satisfactory housing accommodation, but the number so benefited is only a small fraction of the tuberculous families in Wood Green, and many such families are of course, not on the Council's housing application list. In all newly notified cases of tuberculosis, a report is received from the tuberculosis nurse visiting from the Chest Clinic. This is followed by a visit from the Sanitary Inspector, who deals with any housing defects found by service of notice on the owner. This co-operation between the Chest Clinic, which is responsible for the treatment of the patient, and the local authority, which is responsible for dealing with adverse environmental conditions, makes a useful contribution towards the prevention of the disease and the recovery of the patient. More, however, is required for treatment, in the direction of earlier admission to sanatorium, and for prevention in a steady improvement in the housing conditions under which so many of the people live. SCABIES. Seven cases of scabies, requiring treatment during 1949 were sent to the Hornsey Cleansing Station, by arrangement with the Hornsey Borough Council. Four were under school age, 1 was a school child, and 2 were adults. The number dealt with in the previous year was 51. BACTERIOLOGICAL WORK. All the bacteriological work required for the Borough was carried out at the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, and the Public Health Sub-Laboratory, situated at the Coppetts Wood Isolation Hospital, which came into operation on the 23rd May, 1949. The specimens examined during the year were as follows:— Positive. Negative. Total. Diphtheria - 204 321 Haemolytic Streptococci 114 Vincent's Angina 3 Faeces — 7 7 Sputum (for tubercle bacilli) 2 13 15 Pertussis — 2 2 119 226 345 In addition 41 Ice Cream samples were examined. 10 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The number of articles dealt with at the Disinfecting Station was as follows:— Articles disinfected 469 Articles destroyed 58 145 rooms were disinfected on account of infectious disease, and 99 disinfested on account of the presence of vermin. HOUSING. The Borough Surveyor has kindly supplied me with the following figures, showing the number of houses which have been erected or rebuilt during the year. Council Houses Completed:— Durnsford Road 12 "Orlit" houses. Palmerston Road (Grasmere Court) 24 flats. Pellatt Grove (Greenwood House)12 flats. Council Houses in Hand at end of the year:— Bounds Green Road 40 flats. Truro Road (Marlow House) 9 flats. Vincent Road (Vincent Square) 56 flats. Private Enterprise. 41 war-destroyed houses and flats were rebuilt during the year by private enterprise, and a further 45 houses and flats were under construction, giving 42 housing units completed, and 47 housing units in progress. WORK OF THE SANITARY INSPECTORS. The following tables give a brief summary of the routine work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. It will be seen that a very large part of the Inspectors' time is devoted to inspections and re-inspections of dwelling-houses. This is part of the legacy of the war years, during which it was not possible to have all housing defects remedied as they arose, with the result that there has been 11 considerable deterioration in housing property which is now only gradually being remedied. Much of the housing property in Wood Green is now showing the decrepitude of old age, so that more and more attention on the part of the sanitary inspectors is required to keep many houses in a habitable state. Investigations in connection with housing applications have also taken up much of the inspectors' time, every applicant having been visited—many of them not once but several times—during the past few years, so that their housing conditions might be properly assessed under the Council's points scheme. This is valuable work but it has been at times so pressing that it has been carried out to the neglect of equally important work of the inspectors in other directions, and at the end of the year, I reported that the inspectors could no longer undertake all these investigations, and asked that other arrangements might be made, a request which the Council has since granted. It will be seen that the inspectors have devoted much time and attention to the inspection and supervision of food. Particular attention has been paid to all premises where food is prepared for sale, or sold or offered, or exposed for sale for human consumption, to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. Many of these premises have not previously been provided with the equipment necessary to ensure a proper standard of hygiene, but I am glad to say that the inspectors have been very satisfied with the way in which their requirements have been met. The work of the Sanitary Inspector is in my opinion of very great educative value, when exercised with understanding and tact, in improving the hygienic conditions of these premises and so safeguarding the health of the community against the danger of food poisoning. Fortunately, we have been free from any occurrence of food poisoning throughout the year. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA.
