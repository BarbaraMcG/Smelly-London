Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my thirtieth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1916. The health of the inhabitants of the Borough, upon the whole, has been good. The death-rate has fallen 3 per 1,000 upon that of 1915; at the same time there has been a serious diminution in the birth rate. The Maternity and Child Welfare scheme is now in process of development. Complaints have been made that, owing to the war, the houses of the Borough are not as clean as could be desired. I am afraid there are grounds for such complaints. The scarcity of labour required for the carrying out of sanitary works has put great difficulties in the way of the Sanitary Inspectors getting the necessary works quickly done. Upon the whole, the sanitary work carried out in the Borough reflects much credit on the energy and ability of both the male and female inspectoral staff. I have to thank the Council and Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. 2 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS, 1916.

Although the statistics have been worked out on that figure it is the opinion of many persons, well acquainted with the borough, that this estimate of the population is too low. The population at the last Census, (1911) from various reasons, such as the clearance of large areas for rebuilding purposes, the incomplete occupation of recently built properties, and the natural desire of many of the inhabitants to live outside the borough, was found much depleted, but since then matters have changed. It is thought that the population for 1916 may be put at 190,000 as nearer the mark. The demand for women's labour with the large increase in the wages of the artisan class in this war time, has not only made retail trade very good in the borough, but has made it very difficult to find house accommodation. Our large property owners have had no houses to let. The finances of the borough have suffered by the delay of the Tabard Street Area Scheme of rebuilding, and in other similar ways. The physical condition and the appearance of our inhabitants, in this war time, were never better in spite of the increase in the price of all commodities and the difficulty of obtaining many articles of food. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904,1905, 1906,1907,1908,1909, 1910,1912, 1913, 1914,1915 and 1916.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1916 was 4,572, of which 2,389 were males, and 2,183 females. This represents a birth rate of 25.8 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:—Newington, 2,909; St. George the Martyr 1,242; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 421. Of the 4,572 births registered in the borough 72 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the borough. 396 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 72 "outward" transfers are deducted and the 396 "inward" transfers are added to the 4,572 births actually registered in the borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 4,896. This gives a corrected birth-rate of 27 6. Birth-rate for the last Twenty-five Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington.

These deaths in institutions comprised 598 belonging to Southwark and 604 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,050. When the 644 deaths of those persons who were non-parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,050 "outlying" deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 3,039, of which number 1,660 were males and 1,379 females. The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 17.1 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1916, as against a rate of 20 8 for 1915. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 28.9. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

No case of this disease was notified during the year. No death from Small-Pox has occurred in the borough in the last twelve years. SCARLET FEVER. During the year under consideration 301 cases were notified and only five deaths. The notifications and the deaths are the lowest recorded for the last ten years. The extensive spread of the disease during 1914, which must have included the greater part of those susceptible to the complaint, made itself felt in the immunity of the inhabitants in 1916. With so few deaths in the year the disease must have been of a very mild type. The number of cases notified, as compared with London during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark. In London. 1907 1,275 25,926 1912 500 11,312 1908 775 22,072 1913 880 17,552 1909 590 17,251 1914 1,448 25,015 1910 419 10,509 1915 467 17,104 1911 480 10,489 1916 301 8,766 The Wards most affected were St. John, All Saints, St. Mary and St. Paul's Wards.

The deaths in the 293 cases sent to hospital numbered 5, a mortality of 17 per cent. 55 In the 8 cases treated at home, there was no death. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was l.6. It is our practice to spray the room with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls, in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room being verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. The annual death-rate per 1,000 inhabitants living was .02. DIPHTHERIA. This disease has still further increased during the year under consideration both in the number of notifications and in the number of deaths. The numbers are the highest for the last ten years. The percentage of deaths to those treated at the Asylums Board's Hospitals, viz,: 8.5, is not above the average for the last ten years. It is difficult to state the cause of this increase The schools can hardly be held responsible as the cases were pretty evenly spread among them. The same may be said of the milk supply, as no one particular dairy more than the rest was implicated. The flooding of basements of houses had not increased. There had been a greater crowding together of children in ill-ventilated places during the air raids and a general nerve unrest, which may have rendered children more susceptible to the disease. The total number of cases notified including Membranous Croup, was 442, as against 387 for 1915. The deaths from the disease numbered 41, as against 37 for 1915.

The wards most affected were St. John, St. Michael, Sc. Jude and St. Mary. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever in the borough during the year numbered 2, as against 3, 2 and 6. in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 13 for the present year, and 23, 24 and 39, for the three preceding years. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.01.

The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 84'6. 57 The wards most affected were St. Jude and St. Paul. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.01. MEASLES. This disease became notifiable at the beginning of the year 1916. The notifications during that year numbered 2,310. This figure does not represent the whole of the cases occurring in the borough, as the notification was restricted to the first case only in a family. The whole of the cases must have numbered as many as 3,500. The totals deaths were 84. It will be seen by the table of weekly notifications that the disease ran a pretty consistent course throughout the year. Every case was immediately visited, on the same day as notified, and general directions were given to the person in charge of the patient. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1907 112 1912 139 1908 77 1913 105 1909 127 1914 95 1910 225 1915 131 1911 120 1916 94 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.47. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. During the year 25 cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever were notified, of which 13 died. Also 13 cases of Poliomyelitis of which none died. DIARRHHEA. The deaths from Diarrhæa and Enteritis numbered 107. The year under consideration was distinctly favourable to infants in regard to these complaints. The annual death-rate at all ages from Diarrhæa per 1,000 living was 0.60.

The Centre was opened on February 3rd, 1916, when 28 mothers and babies attended. The following figures are recorded up to March 31st, 1917:— Total number of babies on the books 243 Do. consultations held (at which 1185 babies were seen by the doctor) 50 Do. attendances made 2218 The highest attendance on any one day was 78, the lowest 13 and the average 41.18. During the first two months the visiting was entirely done by two voluntary workers, but owing to the increase in numbers, Sister Sharpless was appointed—in April, 1916—part-time Health Visitor, increasing her time to three days a week in November. In the twelve months, from April 1st, 1916, to March 31st, 1917, Sister Sharpless paid about 2670 visits, and the two voluntary workers, who assisted her, about 1400. Co-operation between the Municipal Health Authorities and the Centre has been happily arranged. The Municipal Health Visitors pay all the first, or birth visits, filling up the cards and sending to the Centre's Visitor those belonging to her district. The Centre's Visitor then visits each mother, telling her about the work of the Centre and giving her an invitation to join. When the mother attends, the Centre takes the baby under its care, frequent visits are paid to the home, the mother is encouragcd to attend regularly, and is helped in every way to carry out the doctor's instructions. Should the mother refuse to attend after one or two visits, her card is returned to the municipality and she is not again visited from the Centre unless she eventually joins of her own accord. From the commencement of the Centre, the Thursday consultations have been conducted by Dr. Flora Shepperd, whose work at several centres and schools for mothers is well known to anyone connected with infant welfare work. To her charm of personality and sympathy with the women, as well as to her exhaustive knowledge of the subject, must be attributed the success of the work that has been done. 61 Sister Sharpless's resignation in March, 1917, was accepted with much regret. The loyal way in which she co-operated with the voluntary staff, and her unfailing sympathy with the women, made her work of the utmost value to the Centre. Sister Bell has been appointed as her successor. The work of the Centre could never have been carried on without the support of the voluntary workers. Two ladies gave much of their time to visiting, as mentioned above, and at least five devote their whole energies every Thursday to the baby weighings and consultations. Another lady has most kindly undertaken the cutting-out and making of baby garments, and three or four others make themselves responsible for knitting vests, belts and woolly comforts. The sincerest thanks are due to all those who have given so much time and thought to securing success to the Centre. The balance sheet shows that the mothers themselves paid the sum of £93 6s. 6d., made up by their payments for foods, emulsions, clothes, &c., and by the penny asked from each mother when she attends a consultation. The Local Government Board granted £11 19s. 2d. towards the expenses of the first two months February 3rd to March 31st, 1916, when their financial year ends. Application has been made for a grant towards the expenses incurred from April, 1916, to March, 1917. Most grateful thanks are due to all subscribers and donors. The Centre is run as economically as possible, but certain expenses are inevitable, and no financial help is received from the municipal authori. ties ; it is very much hoped that all friends will continue their generous support. At all times the value of "young life" is great, but at the present crisis every baby, not only saved but nursed up into a healthy citizen, is an invaluable asset to the country. Signed on behalf of the Committee, V. WHITTINGTON, Hon. Sec. 62 Report on St. John and St. Mary's Voluntary Mothers' and Babies' Care Centres, March 31st, 1916, to April 1st, 1917. Begistratiion.-The register for the twelve months from March 31st, 1916, to April 1st, 1917, shows that 1135 new babies have been entered. These were notified to the Centre by— The Borough Council 878 York Road Hospital 178 1135 St. Thomas's Hospital 74 Others 5 The proportion of those living in St. John's Ward to those in St. Mary's Ward is nearly equal. There have been 251 first babies; 136 families were known already with a previous child and two mothers have bad the third child in the three years. Records. Histories of each visit are kept either on the Borough card or on more personal case papers, and all correspondence connected with a case is copied and attached. These with a card-index and road book make ready reference possible. Each card is in numerical order. Visits.—The number of visits paid averages 150 per week by the paid workers and 20 by the voluntary visitors. As only one lady can come to assist now, the work is practically all done by the staff. Over 8000 visits have been recorded. Each home from which a birth is notified is visited (with rave exceptions when a visit is clearly unnecessary) about ten days after the mother's confinement and after the attendance of the doctor or midwife has ceased. A baby is seen four times in the year unless circumstances of illness, poverty, ignorance or prematurity make constant watching necessary. It was hoped to keep in touch with the children until they were of school age, but whether this will continue to be possible seems doubtful owing to the numbers and the constant removals. The pre-natal cases number 252, sent in by the Hospital Almoners. Others are found in the district, and the visitors advise in the same way as in the hospilal cases about preparations, diet, clothing and health matters. They also report any sanitary defects in the houses. 63 It is not considered advisable to form a class. The number of ante-natal visits is about 760. Many of the women come to the office for a personal talk about their domestic difficulties or for help with sewing or cutting-out and knitting. The Weighing Centre is now held in St. John's Institute, Larcom Street, on Tuesdays from 2 to 4. 156 babies have been brought to the consultations, 70 from St. Mary's Ward and 86 from St. John's, with an average atrendance of 28, not including the older children. Dr. Stanley Brook has been attending every week since Christmas, before that every fortnight. He sees all the new comers and as many of the others as require attention. Only incidental treatment is given. Dried milk and virol, &c., are sold at cost price and garments at the cost of the material. There is a short chat on health if time allows, and demonstrations on cooking and needlework. Sales of garments take place from time to time, the profits aiding the funds. Teas always cover the cost. A Penny Bank is to be started in April in order that the mothers can put small amounts in the War Savings, Inspection.—On January 2nd, Dr. Seekings, Medical Inspector for the Local Government Board, visited the Centre officially sending a satisfactory report later.

During the year 2,761 persons were cleansed at the station in King James Street, as against 2.669 persons cleansed during the year 1915. Under our agreement with the London County Council, 2,681 children were cleansed, as against 2,601 cleansed during 1915. It was found necessary in a large number of cases to treat the children twice and sometimes three or four times before they were found to be effectually cleansed. Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 80 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 68 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1915. 69 TABLE 39.

ANNUAL REPORT of the TUBERCULOSIS OFFICER. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir and Gentlemen, In presenting my report of the work done at the Tuberculosis Dispensary for the past year, I have to place on record a considerable increase both iu the work accomplished and in the scope of usefulness of the scheme. The influence of the teaching in the homes of the patients is showing itself in the better care of the rooms inhabited by consumptives, and though the time is too short as yet for any appreciable statistical change as regards incidence and mortality, there is no doubt that the future will show a diminution in both respects as a result of the work being done in the present. As the primary cause of all consumption is the infection by the Tubercle Bacillus, which is encouraged by dampness, darkness, and dust, and is prevented by the opposite conditions, the state of the rooms occupied by the patient, is of the greatest importance and receives our most careful attention. The disposal of the sputum and destruction of the germs is also attended to, and equally important is the removal of other persons from the range of infection by providing a separate room if possible, or at any rate a bed, and doing all that the patient's means will permit to prevent overcrowding. The establishment of an Interim Care Committee which has on it representatives of the chief charities of the district has done very good work in assessing the payments which are made for children when admitted to residential Institutions, which contributions go towards their 167 maintenance while away. Each case is carefully considered on its merits and the family circumstances taken into consideration. The Invalid Children's Aid Association has been especially good in getting homes and treatment for the little patients, and their preventive work in this direction has been most valuable. Thanks are also due to Miss Ashe who has so kindly and efficiently filled the office of Honorary Secretary to the Committee, a post which has entailed much thought and work, which have been ungrudgingly given. As regards insured persons, the Local Government Board Regulations as to Domiciliary Treatment have added largely to the work of the Dispensary, as all cases under panel doctors as Domiciliary Cases have to be reported on periodically by their doctors, and the onus of seeing that this is done falls upon the Tuberculosis Medical Officer whose duty it is to collect and forward these certificates. In Southwark the patients are seen more frequently than the Regulations require, with it is hoped additional benefit to the patient. In addition to the home work done by your nurses on the patients attending the Dispensary, a very large number of visits is paid to the homes of others who for some reason do not attend but prefer to keep under care of their own doctor for treatment, or more often need no active treatment. These cases we find through the notification of the disease, every notified case being visited whether attending the Dispensary or not, and the contacts examined wherever possible, while the hygienic conditions are attended to and sputum flasks and leaflets of simple, instructions distributed to the patients. Thus the influence of the Dispensary extends beyond the boundaries of the cases attending and practically reaches the home of every tuberculous patient. The staff of the Dispensary is the same as last year, and although the work steadily increases it is hoped that during the war it will not be necessary to ask for any additional assistance. The whole staff has worked very hard under the increasing pressure, and great credit and thanks are due to them for the manner in which the work has been carried on. During the year 241 insured and 233 non-insured persons were added to the list of the patients already attending the Dispensary suffering from some form of Tuberculosis. 168 The total number of persons examined for the first time was 1,603, an increase over the preceding year of 28. This number was made up as follows:— TABLE A. Insured Persons (Males 266, Females 187) 453 Non-Insured Persons (Children 937, Females 25, Men 188). 1,150 Total 1,603 29.5 per cent, of these cases examined were found to be Tuberculous, and affected as follows :— TABLE B. Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis: — Insured Persons (Males 176, Females, 62). 238 Non-Insured Persons (Males 10, Females 58, Children, 80). 148 Total 386 TABLE C. Suffering from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis (glands, joints, &c.): — Insured Persons (Males 1, Females 2), 3 Non-Insured Persons (Males 4, Females 8, Children 73). 85 Total 88 962 contacts were examined most of whom were free from Tuberculosis, and in several instances cases sent for examination and consultation were found to have diseases other than tuberculosis, chiefly bronchitis, asthma, or heart disease among adults, and debility and anaemia among the children. 169 TABLE D. Cases found Non-Tuberculous (including contacts):— Insured Persons (Men 73, Women 78). 151 Non-Insured Persons (Men 10, Women 116, Children 751). 877 Total 1,028 Where other diseases were found the cases were referred tr heir doctors with a report on the condition, or if necessary, sent to an appropriate hospital. During the year 10 cases were referred to Guy's Hospital, St. Thomas' Hospital, the Evelina Hospital, the Royal Eye Hospital, and the Orthopaedic Hospital. In cases of debility the Invalid Children's Aid Society has rendered invaluable assistance by sending children to Convalescent Homes or boarding them in the country for several weeks, thus giving them the needed strength to resist more serious disease. The total attendances were as follows:— TABLE E. Attendances of Insured Persons 3,233 ,, Non-Insured Persons 3,252 Total 6,485 The patients are periodically examined and systematic examinations were carried out in the following cases :— TABLE F. Insured Persons (systematic examinations) 875 Non-Insured Persons ,, 1,428 Total 2,303 170 Treatment of Persons under the Insurance Act. The following cases were recommended for treatment during the year:— TABLE G. Sanatorium Treatment 79 Hospital Treatment 26 Dispensary Treatment 5 Domiciliary Treatment 13 Total 123 On return from Institutions the cases are put under the care of their panel doctor as a rule, with periodic reports furnished by him through the Tuberculosis Officer to the Insurance Committee. The Regulations of the Local Government Board also require that the Tuberculosis Medical Officer shall see each case once yearly. This does not seem sufficient if the Tuberculosis Officer is to be of personal assistance to the cases and take an active interest in their welfare, and with so long an interval patients get slack in taking precautions as to spreading the disease. Hence the patients attending the Southwark Dispensary are encouraged to attend every three months after leaving the Sanatorium with better prospect of keeping their restored health. Non-insured persons recommended to Institutions under the London County Council:— TABLE H. Sanatorium 15 Hospital 37 Total 52 These cases are assessed by the Care Committee, the assessment being considered by the London County Council, and if agreed to and the parents are willing to pay the amount, the case is then dealt with. The Care Committee also decide whether they consider the case suitable to be dealt with by the London County Council, or more fitted for the Guardians or Invalid Children's Aid Society. Non-insured adults with limited incomes are not asked for payment. 171 Home Visits by Nurses:— TABLE 1. Insured Persons 1,208 Non-Insured Persons 1,100 Total 2,308 During these visits 324 sputum flasks were distributed and 1,200 leaflets of instructions given to the patients. Two beds have also been lent to necessitous cases. The nurses report a marked all round improvement in the bedrooms of the consumptive patients, and more care in the disposal of sputum. 308 reports have been forwarded to the public authorities, and 211 to private practitioners. 118 specimens of sputum were examined by the Public Analyst, of which 20 were found positive. Of the old cases 93 insured and 47 non-insured persons are kept under supervision, attending periodically for the purpose. The following table gives the number of patients discharged during the year:— TABLE J. Discharges (Medical and Surgical). Insured. Non-Insured Arrested 62 83 Improved 13 18 "In statu quo" 7 10 Moved away 40 34 Transfers to other districts 19 22 Ceased attending 16 9 Domiciliary 15 1 Refused treatment 3 1 Totals 177 188 The deaths of cases under the care of the Dispensary or who had attended there numbered 140. 172 There is considerable Tuberculosis in the Borough, and it is widespread and not by any means confined to the poorer and overcrowded districts, though on the other hand it is a neighbourhood to which many drift when ill and in failing circumstances who formerly lived in other localities—a place where common lodging houses, shelters, small tenements and cheap rooms offer a temporary refuge for the wandering consumptive who leaves a trail of infection behind him. There is no case of consumption that is not directly or indirectly contracted from a previous case, and patients are constantly warned that just as they have contracted the disease through the carelessness of a previous sufferer, so they, in turn, if not observant of due precautions will infect others. Occupation does not play a great part in the disease in Southwark, which is a district of varied industries, but if anything the printing tradeis the local work which supplies the most cases, partly because it is well known as a business unfavourable to those of consumptive tendency, and also because the number of firms engaged in this industry is large.

Of these, six were found tuberculous and five non-tuberculous. The preventive work of the Dispensary is the chief factor in the campaign against Tuberculosis for after all, the cure of a few individuals is a small matter compared with the prevention of multiple infection of others, and to this end we are working, the prevention of the spread of infection by those already diseased. In considering prevention, the attention of public authorities has largely been directed towards the children, and a great deal of good work can be done in increasing their resistance to the disease. As 25 per cent. of all cases in children under 5 years of age are caused by the bovine form of the bacillus, and 45 per cent. of the cases of abdominal, glandular and joint tuberculosis of the same age period are caused by the same strain it is probable that the milk supply is largely responsible for much of the disease in early childhood. It has been found that 10 per cent. of samples of mixed dairy milk entering London is infected with the tubercle bacillus. As far as adults are concerned, the chief source of infection must be looked for among the advanced cases, who daily expectorate incalculable numbers of germs both in their sputum and in the droplets of moisture expelled in coughing, and until the difficulty of satisfactorily and permanently isolating and segregating dangerous advanced cases is surmounted, so long will these cases infect others. Another prolific source of infection is the handing on, or selling of clothes worn by infected patients, and the old clothes shop or stall must often harbour garments spotted with sputum and reeking with germs. In spite of all advice the sputum flask is unpopular, and often discarded for rags and handkerchiefs carried in the pocket which becomes a certain danger to any future owner of the garment. table l. Death Rate from Phthisis for Southwark 2.2 per 1000 Ditto ditto Loudon 1.5 ditto 174 Southwark has the unenviable distinction of having the highest death rate of any London borough for 1916. This is largely due to its topography, being built on low-lying land with a clay subsoil, to a great extent originally marshy. This tends in cold wet weather such as prevailed in the winter to produce catarrh and bronchial troubles which are most serious complications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. In addition there has been the strain of high food prices and the existence in the Borough of a number of persons who cannot afford adequate nourishment. table m. Notification of fresh cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 911 775 653 634 639 table n. Deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. 1912 1913 1914 1915 1916 345 359 330 388 391 Notification of Tuberculosis came in force in 1912, and during that year and 1913 many old standing cases were notified. In the years 1914 and 1915, notifications of new cases have remained at about the same level, whereas the death rate from Pulmonary Tuberculosis has increased. These facts should tend to prove a diminution of Phthisis in the Borough, but it is counteracted by the fact that in past years many who would have removed to the country are unable to do so under existing conditions. This leaves actually more cases in the district. Could the advanced infective cases be compulsorily removed where they are a danger to others, a most fruitful source of the spread of the disease would be avoided. During the years 1912 to 1915 there were 1,417 deaths, of whom only 182 died in Institutions, the balance of 1,235 dying in their own homes—a proportion of 6.7—these cases having been for some months in the most infectious stage of the disease. The local statistics show that the death rate from Phthisis for Children under 5 years is very small, being only one in 27.1 cases, the greater number of deaths occurring between 25 and 45. It follows that the usefulness of any treatment in early childhood is not so much of a curative as a preventive nature, and the object is to increase by every available means the resistance to the disease in later life. 175 That being the case it must obviously be some years.before the results of treatment in children will be apparent, as the effect will not be observed until a later period in their lives, and will only affect statistics some time hence. As regards treatment I have to report continued good results from Tuberculin in suitable cases. The residence in a Sanatorium is as a rule two short for permanent benefit in any but the mildest cases, and in justice to the responsible authorities it must be said that a large proportion of the patients discharge themselves before their stay is completed, and they do not give the treatment a fair chance. Domiciliary treatment is very thoroughly carried out by the panel practitioners of the Borough, but unfortunately there is no similar system for the non-insured cases who often have a difficulty in meeting the expense of home treatment. In conclusion, in presenting my report, I must express my appreciation of the co-operation of all with whom the work has brought me in contact in the task of lessening, as far as possible, the sufferings of the patients and preventing the spread of Tuberculosis in the Borough. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HORACE WILSON, Tuberculosis Officer. Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.E.
