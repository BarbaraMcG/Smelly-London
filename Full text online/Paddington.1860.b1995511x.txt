BURDON SANDERSON, M.D., M.R.C.P., Medical Officer of Health, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consumption, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at St. Mary's Hospital, And formerly Physician to the Western General Dispensary. B 1 R E P O R T TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, The following pages exhibit in summary the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee in execution of the powers conferred on them for the removal of Nuisances, the improvement of dwellings, and for other Sanitary purposes. For information relating to the health and mortality of the population, I beg to refer you to my quarterly Reports, three of which have now been published. During the year terminating March the 25th, 1861, 356 Notices of Orders were issued. The required improvements have been in every instance carried out. The owners of the house No. 6, Alfred Terrace, having neglected for more than twenty-eight days after Notice served on them to construct a drain and other works therein mentioned, proceedings were commenced against them under the 73rd Section of the Local Management Act; but in consequence of the parties liable having complied with the requirements of the Order, these proceedings were suspended. The following is an Alphabetical list of the principal streets and places in which Sanitary works have been carried out during the year. TABLE I. works completed under orders issued during the years 1856 to 1860. In the following Table the upper line includes the Works executed in 1856, 1857, 1858 and 1859; the lower, those in 1860.

On the 19th of July, 1859, a Report was presented to the Vestry by the District Surveyor of Paddington, on the underground rooms occupied as dwellings in the Parish, in contravention of the 103rd Section of the Local Management Act. This Report was referred to the Sanitary Committee, who recommended that the suggestions contained in it should be carried out. The Committee were accordingly empowered by the Vestry to take the necessary proceedings against the parties named in the Report. In pursuance of this resolution, Notices were forthwith served on them requiring them to discontinue the unlawful occupation of the tenements referred to. The occupiers of certain houses in Market Street and Cambridge Place, having failed either to discontinue such occupation, or to make such alterations and improvements as were necessary in order to render their tenements fit for habitation in accordance with the Act, the Vestry Solicitor was instructed to make complaint at the Police Court, Marylebone, against them. One of the parties liable was accordingly proceeded against. The unlawful occupation having been proved, and the defendant having engaged to discontinue the habitation of his room until the necessary alterations had been 19 made to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, a nominal fine only was inflicted, with costs. Proceedings relating to Overcrowding. The following is a list of the cases in which the Officers of the Vestry have been directed to make complaint under the Nuisance Removal Act at the Marylebone Police Court, showing in each case the result of such proceedings.

At the close of my last year's Report I stated that the Canal was then in a "satisfactory condition," and that the state of the water was wholly unobjectionable, contrasting strikingly with its foulness at the corresponding period of the previous year. I regret that this improvement has not continued. Since the cleansing of the Basin, which took place at Whitesuntide 1860, the water has 20 become more and more impure, and there is reason to fear that during the present Summer its condition may be such as again to call forth the active interference of the Sanitary Committee. This has arisen, partly from the inefficiency of the overflow weir at the East end of the Basin, and the consequent stagnancy of the water, but principally from the carelessness of the workmen employed on the wharves, in allowing offensive and putrescible matters to fall into the water in the process of loading the boats. The attention of the Grand Junction Canal Company, was on two occasions last Spring directed to the evils likely to arise from this practice; but there is reason to believe that it still continues, and that a deposit of offensive matter is now accumulating, which in a short time will give rise to all the inconveniences against which the Committee have so perseveringly directed their efforts in former years The inefficiency of the Weir was also reported on, early last season, but no improvement has been effected by the Company. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. B. SANDERSON. 9, Gloucester Place; 13th July, 1861. REPORT OF THE WORKS EXECUTED IN THE SEWERS DEPARTMENT. By WILLIAM MERRY, SURVEYOR. ij REPORT. Vestry Hall, Paddington; June, 1861. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the 196th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," I have the honor to submit my Fifth Annual Report of the Works executed in the Sewers Department,from the 25th March, 1860, to the 25th March, 1861, inclusive. During the period embraced in this Report, forty-four Notices for the erection of one Church, 202 Houses, and three Stables, have been received, in accordance with the requirements of the 76th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," and twenty-five applications have been made, and granted, for the re-construction of Drains to twenty-seven old Houses and Premises. These were rendered necessary in consequence of Notices issued by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, or were executed at the suggestion of the Owners of the respective Buildings. In every case where Cesspools and common 24 Privies previously existed, they have been destroyed and Water Closets substituted. The following Sewers have been constructed in the places undermentioned, at the expense of the Owners of Property:— ft. ft. in. ft. in. Stalham Street, Hasboro' Street. 300 run 1 6 by 1 6 half brick Sewer. Darlington Terrace 520 „ 3 0 by 2 0 ditto ditto.

Total length of Brick Sewer constructed, 7247 feet run. Total length of Drain Pipe laid down, 16,578 feet run. The value of these Works I estimate at £ 6115. The Sewerage Works constructed by W. Crockett, Contractor, in Cambridge Street, Oxford Square (North side), Porchester Place and Polygon Mews South, are part of the improvements suggested in my Report of the 12th May, 1858, on the condition of the Old Sewers in Paddington. On the 26th April, one month after the completion of the Contract, I passed through the Sewers in question, and found them in excellent working order. Seven Head Walls, where foul gases accumulated, have been destroyed, and there is now a strong current of air passing through the whole of the Sewers in this locality. About three miles of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed, the hard deposit which could not be removed by flushing, was raised to the surface and carried away in carts. 26 Nine hundred and one Gully Drains have also been cleansed. Jobbing Works, comprising 310 separate and distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gullies, fixing Traps and other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £966 : 3 : 3. This amount includes the sum of £ 243 : 8 : 3 received from Owners of Property for fixing Traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gullies, and laying Drain Pipes under thoroughfares taken to by the Parish. In addition to the following details, I beg to state that 110 complaints on subjects connected with the Sewers Department have been received. They had reference to stoppages in Sewers, Gullies, Drains, &c. With respect to stoppages in Drains leading into Brick Sewers, they have either been removed from the inside of the Sewer, or the complainant has been informed of the exact spot where the stoppage has occurred; and thus expense and annoyance in stripping the Drain has been obviated. This information is furnished free of expense to every Rate-Payer. It has been my uniform practice to give 27 mediate attention to such matters; and I have succeeded, either in removing the cause of complaint, or have been enabled to suggest a remedy for the evils brought under my consideration. I believe that all the information which it is in my power to furnish, has now been condensed into this Report, which I venture most respectfully to submit to your indulgent attention. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM MERRY, surveyor. The Vestry of Paddington 18 6 1. PADDINGTON, Middlesex.
