September, 1962 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you my Annual Report on the health, vital statistics and sanitary circumstances of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras for the year 1961 In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health, the report is presented in the same general form as has been done for some years past. Vital statistics These will be found summarised on pages 4 and 9-11, whilst comparisons with previous years' figures, dating back to 1924, are on pages 12 and 13. Population The population of St. Pancras, ascertained at the 1961 census, was 123,809. The Registrar General's estimated mid-year population, however, was 125,340, which continues the steady downward trend consistent almost since the last war. The reduction this year was 2,370. Births and birth rate The number of live births of St. Pancras babies during the year was 2,293. This figure includes babies born to St. Pancras mothers outside the Borough, and excludes those born in the Borough to parents resident in other areas. The number is 51 less than in 1960 Taking into account the reduced population figure, however, the rate per 1,000 estimated population remains as last year, at 18.3, which is the highest since 1947 Deaths and death rate The number of deaths at all ages during the year was 1,400, an increase of 46 over that in 1960 Here the decline in population has an adverse effect on the death rate which has risen by 56 to 11 16 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Inward and outward transfers have been added to, or deducted from, the figure of deaths occurring in the Borough, and the figure 1,400 includes, therefore, St. Pancras residents only. Area comparability factors There are many considerations which have a bearing on the number of births and deaths, and these vary as between different areas The proportions, for example, of old to young or males to females vary considerably from area to area. i Area comparability factors are, therefore, supplied by the Registrar General by which the crude birth and death rates of an area are multiplied in order to render them comparable with the crude rates for England and Wales, and with the rates of other areas which have been similarly modified with their respective factors for the purpose. The factors for St. Pancras are - births 0.88 and deaths 0.99. The adjusted rates, therefore, are - births 17.10 and deaths 11.05. Causes of death The main causes of death of St. Pancras residents are roughly the same as in recent years, with slight variations up or down, but nothing of any significance. It is gratifying to note, however, the continued fall in the number of deaths from tuberculosis. Prom 13 in 1960 to 9 in 1961 is, in itself, of little consequence, but it is pleasing to reflect that, although from 1924 to 1929 and again in 1931 the corresponding figure each year was over 200, the years 1932 to 1949 showed a steady decrease, and from 105 in 1949, the figure drops to 76 in 1950. Infantile deaths in 1961 were 55, being 2 less than in the previous year, but the rate per 1,000 live births was the same at 24. It is worthy of note that no less than 47 of these babies died under the age of 4 weeks, and 44 of them under 1 week. There were, in addition, 51 still births, the highest number since 1947, and 12 were illegitimate. In fectious diseases A table giving the figures of notifications of infectious disease cases since the year 1931 is included on pages 21 and 22. It will be noted that measles notifications were highest since 1938, with the exception of 1951. All other notifications were either down or approximately the same as in the previous year. There were 2 cases of diphtheria, however, which is a matter for comment to-day, though up to immediately prior to the last war the annual figure was usually between 300 and 400. In 1937 it was as high as 614. Such is the progress made in the control of this disease that it could be wiped out, if all children were immunised in infancy and received 'booster'injections during later childhood. 1 case of smallpox was diagnosed in late December. The patient had only recently arrived by air from Pakistan Between the 25th December and the end of the year no less than 191 visits were paid by the Council's Public Health Inspectors in tracing and maintaining a close watch on contacts, and it will be appreciated that the amount of other work was considerable. Strenuous efforts were in operation at the end of the year to avoid the spread of this disease. The man died in the new year, but no further case developed in the Borough. The incident, however, served as an effective reminder of the added dangers of this disease, brought about by the fact that the speed of air travel renders it so possible for a person to start and complete a world-wide journey within the incubation period, ii Clean Air Act Smoke Control area work proceeded throughout the year The St. Pancras (No.3) Smoke Control Order became operative on the 1st October,1961, thus completing that area of St Pancras south of Euston Road No.4 area, comprising Ward 1, is to become operative on the 1st October, 1963, having already been approved by the Minister of Health Two additional outside Investigation Officers were appointed during the year in order to keep abreast of the volume of work Sanitary circumstances The number of complaints received by the Department was 600 less than in the previous year. There were 3,832 in 1945; 5,689 in 1946 and 7,550 in 1947- Since that year a steady reduction has been noted, and the year 1961 shows a figure which, for the first time since the war, is below 3,000., The number of Intimation and Statutory notices served also showed a reduction. Visits by Inspectors, however, show an increase over the previous year, and there were more house to house inspections In April 1961 the Council resolved to utilise its powers under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957 By the end of the year 16 properties were the subject of notices, whilst a further 20 had received preliminary investigation with a view to subsequent Section 9 action; 187 visits were made in this connection Work in respect of house purchase on loan and improvement grants showed considerable increase, visits being 683 as compared with 325 in the previous year It is hardly necessary to emphasise that increased visits involved additional clerical and report work. St. Pancras Association for the Care of the Aged I reported fully in my Annual Report last year on the progress of S.P.A.C.A. The Association's activities have continued steadily during the past year, as shown in the following summary:- No.of visits by Health Officers 8,787 Meals supplied to old people in their homes 41,586 Meal vouchers issued 9,695 Wireless sets on loan 109 Chiropody- No. of clinics 458 New cases 86 Re-attendances 3,180 Seen by doctor 360 Holidays- Persons sent to Cliftonville 160 Otherwise assisted 15 The first workshop for the elderly was opened at the Tonbridge Club, Cromer Street, on Wednesday, 27th September, 1961, and 28 people were attending at the end of the year. iii Conclusion I acknowledge with gratitude the continuance during the year of the closest co-operation between members of my Department and the Medical Practitioners of the Borough, hospital doctors and almoners, National Assistance Board Officers and many others, particularly in connection with infectious disease notifications and the welfare of old people., I am appreciative of the help and encouragement afforded me during the year by members of the Council, and in particular by the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee. My thanks are also due to the other chief officers of the Council and their staffs for the continuance of that happy relationship which is so helpful at all times. Finally, my sincere thanks to all the members of my own staff for their unfailing help and co-operation throughout the year.
