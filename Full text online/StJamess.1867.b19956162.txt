General Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S. WESTMINSTER. IN THE YEAR 1867-68 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall., Piccadilly, June, 1868. Reverend Sir, My Lords and Gentlemen, I have again the honor of submitting a Report of the Proceedings that have taken place, and the Works that have been executed with the relative costs thereof, in connection with my Department in this Paris, between the 25th March, 1867, and the 25th March, 1868. This statement is only intended to apply to those matters of importance, or of sufficient interest to require to be touched upon in such a Report, as 14 the multifarious matters connected with an office involving much routine work, would answer no useful purpose by publication; in addition to which from time to time the Vestry and the Works Committee are made acquainted with, and thoroughly informed of, all the details of the various matters that it is their duty to investigate or cause to be executed. paving works. As the Vestry are aware, the Paving Works in this Parish are executed in two ways, or under two systems, some portions are done by the Vestry themselves, and some by contractors according to the nature of the work, and the circumstances under which it is required to be performed. trenches. Of the Work executed by the Vestry, perhaps the most important and responsible is making good the openings caused by the Gas and Water Companies, although the Vestry are put to no expense in the matter, being re-imbursed the amount. It will be seen that during the twelve months ending the 25th March, 1868, there were altogether 1450 of these openings made good — of various dimensions—and this number does not altogether 15 represent the fact, as many of them have to be done twice or three time over, sometimes years afterwards, so that about double that number would be a fair average; and as the injuries to the Gas and Water Mains and Service Pipes are constantly caused by the very heavy and continuous traffic, it follows, that the openings are in the busiest places, and that much promptitude and care is required to prevent accidents, which I am happy to report we have been hitherto free from. I mention this subject because it is one that escapes notice, and appears a trivial matter, but is really of the greatest importance, and the consequences of neglect would be immediately and, probably, severely felt. There observations apply in a modified form to those openings made good for private individuals, the difference being that these works are generally after the removal of hoardings, &c., and being pressing, and do not require attention more than once. The cause of the openings made by the Gas and Water Companies being of so much more importance, is that they (the Companies) are empowered by law to disturb the paving in many instances without giving any previous notice, so that when they send the notice afterwards, there is 16 no time to be lost in putting all straight; but builders and private individuals having to procure leave beforehand, we are aware that such matters will require attention, and can make our arrangements accordingly. haymarket. A portion of the Footway on the west side of the Haymarket has been Re-laid, partially with new stone, the previous work being very defective. windmill street, little. In Little Windmill street, a portion of the carriageway being much sunk, has been Re-laid, and still requires attention; the Paving in this street has of late years been constantly defective, and I am afraid will continue so for some time; the cause, however, viz. the escape of the sub-soil into the sewers, has been remedied, and after a time the surface will be maintained more effectually. cambridge street. A portion of the Carriage and Footways in Cambridge Street has also been Re-laid under the same circumstances as Little Windmill Street. 17 BERWICK STREET, PRICES STREET, POLAND STREET. Portions of the carriageways in Berwick Street, Princes Street, and Poland Street, have been Re-laid, and the channels, kerbs, and footways regulated. Numerous works of more or less importance have been executed, such as small repairs, axing overe or roughing slippery places, letting in coal plates, attending to dangerous places, spreading ballast in slippery weather or frost, and other miscellaneous matters which necessarily occupy a considerable amount of time and attention. SNOW. There has been no occasion to take any steps with regard to the removal of snow. During the last Winter there was no fall of sufficient importance to warrant the expenditure of money in extra labour, although every preparation was made to meet an emergency. REGENT STREET. ??? One new refuge for foot passengers, together with a stand post for the supply of water has been erected in Regent Street, opposite Foubert's Place, B 18 and though this grew out of the proposition to remove a stand post in Golden Square, in consequence of annoyance to the inhabitants, it has been found highly serviceable, and is a judicious and public improvement; more of these refuges, however, are still required. Slight alterations have also been made to those existing by Glasshouse Street, and Charles Street, which alterations have also been found useful. In addition to these special works, the McAdam Roadways in Regent Street and Piccadilly have been maintained by Mr. Browse, whose contract for Regent Street expired on the 25th of March, and he has been ably succeeded by Messrs. Culverhouse, who bid fair to perform their duties with honesty and ability. sewers works. It will be seen that almost the whole of the works executed by the Yestry in the Sewers Department, have consisted principally of repairs, or maintaining those works already constructed, rather than in building new. Some of these works have been of a rather unexpected character, and several are entered under the head of 'Cleansing," which means that from 19 some cause or other the Sewer has failed to perform its functions, and instead of discharging its contents, retains them until a stoppage of a house drain or drains occurs, and forces the Vestry to adopt such measures as will render the Sewer in a fit and proper condition. LITTLE WINDMILL STREET AND CAMBRIDGE STREET. One great cause of these stoppages is want of fall in the Sewer, and in St. James's Parish this is especially the case with those Sewers running cast and west; those that run from north to south, have a most ample fall, but even in some of these such as Little Windmill Street and Cambridge Street, serious stoppages have happened by a vast accumulation were several: one was, that at the time the Sewer was built, openings or eyes covered with pices of wood, were left for the purpose of connecting the house drains at some future period, which it was expected would have lasted long enough or until the connection was made; it turned out subsequently, however, that it was too much trouble to find these eyes, or from some cause they were not found, the drains were otherwise constructed, and in course of time the pieces of wood decaying, the rats commencing 20 their explorations, and the sand and heavy soil beginning to run into the sewer, soon caused an obstruction; there was another reason viz., the defects in the brickwork which in these sewers is only inches or half a brick thick; this may be ample as longs a all goes well, but cannot stand any little movement or settlement however slight; and with regard to sewers works generally, the injuries are by no means the work of time only, for the indefatigable rat assists nature very materially in causing and extending evils of many kinds. regent street. Several of these items appear in connection with the Regent Street Sewers, which I am sorry to say have not improved, and several small sums have been paid to the inhabitants where they have themselves, thinking their drains were defective, attempted to remedy the evil, which eventually turned out to be the duty of the Vestry. side entrances. One peculiar item is a charge for chaining down or otherwise securing almost the whole of the side entrances to the sewers, a measure considered at the time essential, as a means of preventing 21 persons who could have no legitimate business there from having accers to the sewers, and which item I trust will never appear again. The various other matters set forth in the list require little explanation. Some improvements have been made in ventilation, some new gullies built, and several trapped; much of course still remains to be done in these matters, but as the whole subject is under the consideration of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and as they are collecting all the information they can, it is wise to wait and avail ourselves of the benefit of their labour, when the result is published. URINALS. During the twelve months the Vestry have removed two offensive uninals, one in Mason's Yard, Duke Street, and one in Ham Yard, Great Windmill Street, and have substituted two new state ones in their stead, with increased accommodation in cach; though these are manifest imprvements, still much remains to be done to reach perfection, and the fact cannot be denied, that to construct public veniences, to meet all the requirements of the population of London, is a far more serious under- taking than appears at first sight, or would be readily believed. Convenience, strength, an amount 22 of ornamentation, and the impossibility of being easily injured are among the points to be aimed at; absence of smell, and general cleanliness are indispensable, and the whole should be maintained or always kept in a state of perfection, or as near it as possible, but the amount of money required to achieve all these points, especially the most essential one—a public position—has hitherto been a most serious obstacle to the erection of superior public conveniences; if it were my duty to collect statistics on the subject I have every reason to believe that I should discover that much injury to health results from the want of these conveniences to those whose occupations are chiefly out of doors. Those urinals that the Vestry actually possess have been maintained in as good condition as circumstances will allow; the drains are attended to, they are daily flushed, disinfectants are used if necessary, and the iron work is periodically painted. The Yestry and the Works Committee have allowed no opportunity to pass where a site could be obtained for the erection of public urinals, but this Parish offers such a limited number of eligible sites, that they are almost reduced to none at all that can be practically used for the purpose. 23 VESTRY HALL. Among the incidental matters that have received the attention of the Vestry is the completion of the Vestry Hall. This work consisted chiefly of painting, and has been done in a most substantial manner by Mr. Hatfield, of King Street, Regent Street, and has given general satisfaction; the building is now in good repair, and will in all probability require but little to be expended upon it for many years. The other matters set forth in the list require but little comment; all the works enumerated having been done by the express orders of the Works Committee as necessary ones, and possess but little interest to those not immediately concerned.

F.LS. &c. &c. MEDICAL OFFICES OF HEALTH FOR ??? 33 The Parish of St. Jame's, Westminister. Reverend Sir. My Lords, and Gentlemen, I have now, for the twelfth time, the honour of laying before you various tables and documents, With regard to the state of the Public Health in the Parish during the year 1867, and the various measures taken for the removal of the causes of disease and death amongst its inhabitants. The General Mortality. In the first place I would call your attention to the record of the causes of death in the year, which are found in the four first tables in the appendix. By these you will see what has been the death of the whole year, and what the death in each quarter. The total number of deaths in 707, and in order that you may compare that mortality with previous C 34 years, I subjoin the deaths for each year from 1856, when the Metropolitan Management Act came into force. 1856 682 1862 727 185 7 712 1863 757 1858 669 1864 832 1859 764 1865 704 186 0 723 1866 769 186 1 758 1867 707 From this yon will see that, although the year 1867 did not present a lower mortality than three other years, that it presented a mortality considerably below the average. At the same time that this low mortality is a cause of congratulation, I have no wish to conceal from you the fact that the rates of mortality of the last four years is greater than the two precedingfour years, in which I have been Medical Officer of Health in your Parish. This being the Twelfth Annual Report I have laid before you, I may conveniently divide the last twelve years into three equal periods of four years, from which you will find that the mortality from 1856 to 1859 inclusive, was 706—that from 1860 to 1863 inclusive, it was 741 —and that from 1864 to 1868 it was 752. 35 Thus it will be seen that in the three quatrennal periods the last has been the most unhealthy. It would appear from this that our sanitary action was of but little avail. There is, however, a very obvious explanation of the want of apparent proof of the value of our sanitary activity. The first four years were those which followed the fatal epidemic of Cholera in 1854; in these years great precautions were taken against the recurrence of this disease, and the district where it occurred was less populated than it had been previous to that distressing epidemic. In the last few years you will find, by referring to my reports, that we have had two years of unusual cold, an agent of disease over which sanitary measures have but little control, this accounts for the slight excess of the average mortality of the last four years; at the same time the average mortality of 733 in the year, although not large in comparison with many districts in London, and many large towns in England, is one that ought to be reduced, and only shows the necessity of increased activity in weeding out the sources of disease. It should always, however, be recollected, that in the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, the death-rate weighs very differently in the three divisions of the Parish. Thus taking the districts, independent of that of the Workhouse, it will be seen that whilst the deaths in the St. James's 36 Square Division is 1 in 78 of the population, in the Golden Square Division it is 1 in 66, and in the Berwick Street Division, 1 in 45. Taking in the death in the Workhouse, the whole death of the Parish is 1 in 57 of the population. It must, however, be recollected that the Workhouse is tenanted more highly with persons from the Berwick Street Division of the Parish, thus making the death-rate of that Division at least 1 in 40 of the population. Although this death-rate is not exceedingly high for a city population, it nevertheless represents that District in the Parish which demands most attention and the one where there is the most ample room for future sanitary operations. Zymotic Diseases. In remarking, from year to year, on the general health of the Parish, I have always insisted on the necessity of separating the deaths whieh occurred from general causes from those which were produced by specific poisons. It has always appeared to me if the public were sufficiently instructed, and the authorities sufficiently alive, we might put an end to those diseases which one call Zymotic, just as we have put an end to Plague in England, which was once a national curse. I believe we might put 37 an end to Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Measles, and other catching diseases. In St. James's, Westminster, we have at least scotched one form of disease, that is Typhus Fever. Although the Times newspaper, some years since, debited Little Windmill Street with constant cases of Typhus, and refused to retract the mis-statement, it is a fact that we suffer little from Typhus, on account of the active measures that are taken whenever a case breaks out. The following table gives a summary of the principal forms of Zymotic Diseases which have produced death in the Parish during the last 12 years. Name of Disease. 1855 185G 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 1866 Small Pox 3 5 .. .. 4 4 1 1 21 .. 2 1 Measles 7 5 13 10 38 8 17 9 24 29 17 19 Scarlet Fever) & Dipht. 27 16 13 29 31 16 32 66 31 13 20 30 Whpg.

You will see by the preceding return how small has been the number of deaths in your Parish from Small Pox during the last four years. At the same time it is only right to state that in a large proportion of cases where Small Pox occurs, they are at once removed to the Small Pox Hospital, and should death occur, it is not registered in your Parish. Since my last reference to this disease a new Vaccination Act has been passed. On the 29th of March, 1866, I called your attention to the deficiencies of this Act, and a deputation from this Vestry waited on Mr. Bruce, who introduced the Bill into Parliament, for the purpose of pointing out the manifest deficiencies of its requirements for securing the vaccination of the people. The objections I urged against this Bill were— 1. That it places all authority in the hands of the Guardians of the Poor, and ignores altogether the Vestry with its Medical Officers of Health. 2. The sum offered for paying the operation of Vaccination is not sufficient to induce intelligent medical men to undertake the duty, and is not a sum that could be considered a 39 proper remuneration for the requisite care and attention demanded for successful vaccination. 3. That without compulsory registration of births all attempts at compulsory Vaccination must be failures. In June, 1867, I again brought the subject of the deficiencies of the Vaccination Bill before the Sanitary Committee, and waited on Lord Robert Montague to endeavour, if possible, to obtain efficient legislation on the subject. On the 20th of June, I repeated to the Vestry what I had expressed to the Sanitary Committee, my “ conviction that any “ attempt at legislation for Vaccination must be a “ failure unless connected with a Compulsory “ Registration of Births. Although compulsory “ registration of birth exists in Scotland and Ireland, “ no measure of this kind exists in England. The “ want of such a measure is seen in the fact that, “ although we have had Compulsory Vaccination Acts “ for 25 years, Small Pox is more rife than ever. “ In 1863-4-5 upwards of 20,000 persons died in “ England and Wales of Small Pox. Where one “ person dies, 20 at least take the disease and get “ well. Taking the estimate of the cost of this “ death and disease at its lowest money value of “ ten pounds for each death, and five pounds for 40 “ each case that recovers, it would represent a sum “ of no less than ,£2,500,000. Disease and Death “ are the most costly luxuries in which a nation “ can indulge.“ A quarter of this sum spent in the proper payment of Vaccinators, would have been more than enough to have prevented every case of Small Pox, which has made up this enormous amount of disease and death. Typhoid or Drain Fever. On the 25th of November, I reported that whilst in the whole the death-rate of the last fortnight had been satisfactory, three fatal cases of Zymotic disease had occurred, and one of these was Typhoid Fever. This case occurred in Wellington Mews, and several members of the same family were attacked but recovered. On this occasion I reported as follows:— “ This disease, which is also known by the name “ of Drain Fever, is the result of defective drainage, “ but when once acquired it may be conveyed to “ houses properly drained. We are always exposed “ to the importation of this frightful disease from “ undrained to well-drained houses. Although so “ much has been done for the drainage of the “ houses of the poor, the more opulent and well-to“ do inhabitants of the cities are strangely negligent 41 “ about their drainage. Several cases have recently “ come under my notice where life has been lost amongst this class. No one should take a house “ without a certificate from a trustworthy authority “ that the drains are properly laid, and builders and “ bricklayers neglecting their duty in this respect, “ should be liable to prosecution and fine. The “ negligent way in which the drainage of houses is “ performed, is a constant source of disease and “ death in this and other Parishes of England.“ Water Supply. The Vestry having kindly given me permission, at the beginning of the year 1867, to use one of the vacant upper rooms of the Vestry Hall as a Chemical Laboratory, I have from time to time submitted the waters from the cisterns to analysis. I have also examined the Waters supplied from the mains of The Grand Junction Waterworks, The West Middlesex Waterworks, The Chelsea Waterworks, and The New River Waterworks. The waters supplied to the mains has, on the whole, been as free from impurities as water taken from polluted sources, like the Thames and New River could be expected to be. In the history of 42 all these companies' waters, there are periods when the supply is less pure than usual, and this appears to arise from the filtering processes employed at the reservoirs becoming more or less defective. A more serious evil lies in the constant neglect on the part of nearly all the householders of the Parish to see to the cleansing of their cisterns. Under my direction, the Sanitary Inspector has collected, from week to week, water drawn from various cistern's in the parish. It is not rare to find water of the most dangerous quality amongst these specimens, and these frequently attached to the premises of the more opulent inhabitants. Whenever impure water is discovered in the houses of the wealthy, they are immediately warned of their danger, whilst in the houses of the poor the landlord is compelled at once to see to the proper cleansing of the cistern. The impurities most commonly found are those arising from an accumulation of organic impurities at the bottom of the cistern, or from the communication of the cistern by waste pipes, or water closet pipes with the drains, or the contents of the closet pipes. None but those acquainted with the details of these arrangements could believe in the utter and entire disregard to health in which nearly all 43 the interior fitting up of houses is managed. It is in the private houses of the wealthy and luxurious that the most startling instances are found of the neglect of the most obvious means of securing health. A contamination which ought never to occur where the most ordinary precautions are taken for the cleaning of cisterns, is that of impregnation with lead. Within the last eighteen months I have met with several instances of water charged with lead, from the action of organic matter on the lead of the cistern in which it was stored. As an instance of how water may be contaminated with lead, I may mention that all the water supplied to the Vestry Hall was for many months charged with lead, when fresh drawn from the pipes. This arose from the fact that the new leaden pipes were easily acted on by the water, and thus the water became impregnated with lead. The first water drawn, when it has been standing in leaden pipes, should be rejected for all cooking and kitchen purposes, and no water should be drunk that has been standing for any length of time in leaden pipes. I am reminded here that all these evils arise from two sources:— 1. An intermittent supply of water. 44 2. Leaden cisterns and pipes. Surely the time has come when the Greatest City in the World should be supplied with water without either injuring or killing its inhabitants. There are a thousand cities in the world in which such a contingency would be impossible. Adulteration of Food. I would call your attention to the fact that in 1860, I was made, according to the requirements of the Act for the Prevention of the Adulteration of Food, Food Analyst for your Parish. As this office was conferred upon me without any arrangement as to the nature of the duties I was to perform or the means of performing them, I have little to report on the subject. I am, however, occasionally called on by the public to exercise my functions. During the past year I was requested to analyse some milk for a large establishment in the Parish, and this has drawn my attention generally to the subject of milk and its adulterations. I have now examined, to satisfy my own mind, several hundreds of specimens of milk procured in the Parish, and whilst on the whole, I think the quality of the milk is creditable to the milk sellers of the Parish, I am bound to say, I have met with a large 45 quantity of milk so entirely deficient in the dietetical constituents of this food, that those who use it are not only cheated out of their money but their food. Overcrowding. By the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act of 1866, it is enacted that “On application to one of Her “ Majesty's Municipal Secretaries of State, by the “ nuisance authority of the City of London, or any “ district or parish included within the Act for the “ better Local Government of the Metropolis, or “ of any Municipal Borough, or of any place under “ the Local Government Act 1858, or any Local “ Improvement Act, or of any city or town “ containing, according to the census for the time “ being in force, a population of not less than 5,000 “ inhabitants, the Secretary of State, may, as he “ may think fit, by notice to be published in the “ London Gazette, declare the following enactment “ to be in force in the district of such Nuisance “ Authority, and from and after the publication of “ such notice, the Nuisance Authority shall be “ empowered to make regulations for the following “ matters.”— 1. The fixing the number of inhabitants in houses let in lodgings. 46 2. The Registration of such houses. 3. The regular inspection of Registered houses. 4. The enforcing Sanitary Regulations in such houses. Under the powers given by this Act the following Regulations were made for this Parish, and approved by the Secretary of State for the Home Department— 1. Whenever the Vestry may consider it necessary to apply these Regulations to any house within the Parish, which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family or household, they shall by their Clerk give a written notice to the owner thereof of their intention so to do, stating the entire number of persons allowed to sleep in such house, together with a ticket stating the number of each room and the number of persons which each room is registered to accommodate, which ticket shall be kept hung up in the room, and produced when required, to any officer of the Vestry appointed for inspecting such registered houses. 2. The minimum of space allowed for each inmate of a room used either exclusively as a dormitory, or both by day and night, shall be as follows:— In Rooms haying Chimneys. CUBIC FEET. In Rooms not having Chimneys. CUBIC FEET. If occupied exclusively as Dormitories 400 500 If occupied both by day and night 500 600 47 3. Not more than two persons above the age of fifteen years (unless they he of one sex), shall occupy the same sleeping room. 4. Booms used as kitchens or sculleries and such cellar dwellings as cannot lawfully, under Section 42 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, be separately used for dwellings, shall not be occupied as sleeping rooms. 5. A Register shall be kept at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, of all houses to which these Regulations are made to apply, and the persons paying or liable to pay Rates for snch houses, or having paid them at the last collection, or whose names are entered in the Poor Rate Books as the occupiers thereof, shall be deemed to be the owners for the purposes of these regulations. 6. The owner of every such house shall keep the same in good repair and the roof thoroughly watertight, and cause the walls and ceilings of every room, and of the staircases and passages, and the vaults, cellars, areas, and yards of such house to be well and sufficiently coloured or limewashed, or otherwise thoroughly cleansed in the month of April in every year, and at such other periods as may be directed by the Vestry, and shall cause the floors of all the rooms, passages, and stairs of such house, together with the yards and areas attached thereto, to be kept at all times thoroughly clean. 7. The owner of every such house shall cause every room to be ventilated from the outside and otherwise, and the passages and staircases to be lighted and ventilated at 48 their highest part, and elsewhere, to the satisfaction of the officer appointed by the Vestry for inspecting such houses. 8. Whenever an inmate of any such house shall be attacked with fever, scarlet fever, small-pox, cholera, or other infections disease, the owner shall forthwith give notice to the Vestry Clerk, at the Vestry Hall, Piccadilly. 9. The owner of every such house shall provide such accommodation for washing, and such a supply of water for the use of the lodgers, with proper covered receptacles and apparatus above ground, as shall be satisfactory to the Medical Officer of Health. The receptacles shall be of such size as to give at least fifteen gallons a day to each inmate of such house, and be unconnected with any water closet. 10. Every such house shall be furnished with a covered dust bin of sufficient size to contain the dust, ashes, &c., that accumulate in the intervals of its being cleared away, which shall not exceed one week; such dust bin to be in the situation pointed out by the Medical Officer of Health. 11. A water closet shall be provided in the yard of every such house, or where a water closet cannot be so provided, then outside or inside the house in the best practicable situation. If it is desired that one water closet should serve in common for two or more small houses, the sanction of the Vestry must be previously obtained thereto. For every house in which there are more than twenty persons an additional water closet shall be provided, and 49 another if more than forty persons, and so on in proportion. 12. Every house shall be properly drained with a sufficient drain communicating with some sewer, and every drain shall be provided with efficient immoveable traps at each entrance to the drain. No roof, gutter, or rain water pipe shall be used for oarrying off slops or refuse. 13. Every water closet shall be provided with pan, trap, and with a properly acting water apparatus to be fixed within the receptacle supplying water, and the floor, walls, and pans thereof shall be kept free from filth and clean in all other respects, and the water closet limewhited twice in every year, in the months of April and September, and such water closets shall be properly disinfected when ordered by the Medical Officer of Health. 14. The yards and areas of every such house shall be properly drained and every drain provided with efficient immoveable traps, and paved so as to run dry, and effectually take off all waste water. 15. Every registered house, and every room thereof, shall be open to the Medical Officer of Health, and any other officer of the Vestry appointed for the inspection thereof, between the hours of Eight o'Clock a.m. and Ten o'Clock p.m. And when there is reason to believe that the regulations respecting the number of persons to be allowed to sleep in such house or room are infringed, then it shall be lawful for any two such officers, acting together, to visit any such house or room between the hours of Ten p.m. and Eight a m. D 50 16. A copy of these Regulations shall, as soon as any house is registered, be left with the owner thereof, and on the premises, by the officer appointed by the Vestry; and infringement of any one of them shall render the offender liable to a penalty of not more than Forty Shillings, and to an additional penalty of not more than Twenty Shillings for every day during which a default in obeying such Regulations may continue. 17. The above penalties may be imposed by the Vestry, and if on demand the person on whom they are imposed, refuses or neglects to pay the same, such penalties may be recovered before two Justices in manner directed by an Act of the 11th and 12th Victoria, cap. 43, intituled "An Act to facilitate the performance of the duties of the Justices of the Peace out of Sessions within England and Wales with respect to summary convictions and orders," or any Act amending the same. 18. The powers and duties imposed by these Regulations upon the Vestry may be exercised by the Sanitary Committee thereof. 19. These Regulations shall be in force until the 10th day of May, 1868, and no longer. By Order of the Vestry, GEORGE BUZZARD, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 14th February, 1867. Approved, S. H. WALPOLE, Home Office, 10th May, 1857. 51 These regulations seemed to me important, as containing a clause specifying the quantity of cubic feet of air that should be required for sleeping and sitting rooms, amongst an overcrowed population. The power having been obtained to regulate the space, I at once set to work to ascertain the number of notices to be served on persons for lightening the pressure of the population on the existing lodging space. Three or four spots were selected, and about 25 houses were examined tor commencing operations. Although I knew that individual houses in the Parish were overcrowded, it was not until this house to house visitation had taken place that I could form any accurate idea of the amount of overcrowding that exists throughout the whole Parish. It was on this account that in my Report of August 15th, I recommended that further steps should not be taken to introduce the "Regulations" into the whole Parish, but that they should be applied only in cases where extreme necessity demanded interference. The houses examined by the Sanitary Inspector, and on which my recommendation was founded were No. 37, Rupert Street. No. 2, Tyler's Court, Berwick Street. No. 3, Tyler's Court. No. 4, Tyler's Court. Nos. 6 to 20 (inclusive) Heddon Street, Regent St. 52 In these 25 houses, there were found living in the various rooms 549 persons, or on an average 22 persons in each house. When it is remembered that these houses were originally constructed for the accommodation of only one family, it will at once occur to every one how wretched, deficient, and degrading must be the accommodation when four, five, or even six families are crowded into the same. On measuring the rooms in which these families lived it was found that if the cubic space required by the "Regulations" were insisted on, that the above houses would only accommodate 198 persons, shewing that 350 persons would, in these 25 houses alone, have to be turned into the streets. This, however, was not the whole question, the 25 houses were but a specimen, and I have calculated that there are at least 500 other houses equally overcrowded in the Parish. It will be thus seen, that in order to carry out the "Regulations" with regard to cubic space, that at least 7,000 persons must have been removed from their houses. Nor would this have been the whole of the evil, for if those 7,000 persons had been, for the sake of their health, compelled to get rooms somewhere else, they would have been obliged to leave the Parish altogether, as there is no new building going on in St. James's, or its neighbourhood. 53 They must, therefore, have gone to the surrounding parishes, to have increased the overcrowding there, or have been expelled to suburban districts, where it would have been impossible for them to carry on their occupations. It is in this way, that I believe a large amount of pauperism has been caused in London, by persons being driven from the locality in which they were capable of earning a maintenance, to districts where they have no means of employment. It seems then to me, that till the time comes when it shall be seen necessary to erect proper dwellings for the poor in this, and other parishes of London, that we must submit to overcrowding with all its physical degradation and moral pollution as a lesser evil, than driving men women, and children into the streets and to places far away from their work, and the exercise of that industry by which alone they can be kept from destitution and pauperism, I see no remedy for this state of things, but the erection of dwelling places adapted for the working classes to live in, in the districts where their labor is required. Such places have been erected to a limited extent in our Parish, and have succeded, but it should be recollected that to render the population of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, as healthy as it might be, and as it ought to 54 be, there need to be additional lodging-house accomodation for 7,000 people. In order that you may form an idea of the work necessary to be done to accomodate such a number of people, I would call your attention to the Ingestre Buildings which will lodge about 300 people. A building or buildings that will lodge twenty-three times this number of people must be provided, if the population of this Parish is to remain the same, and its health secured. There are many spots in the Parish where such lodging houses might be eligibly built. Nearly every court in the Parish is overcrowded, and a gigantic nuisance, injurious to health. Smith's Court, Tyler's Court, William and Mary Yard, Crown Court, Great Crown Court, Heddon Street, Market Street, and many spots in Berwick Street, Marshall Street, Silver Street, Brewer Street, and Great and Little Windmill Streets, offer admirable sites for such buildings. In the construction of such lodging houses, the wretched domiciles which now minister to the poor, the indolent, the vicious and the criminal classes would be abolished. Instead of a diseased and destitute population preying on the rates, you would have one that would contribute to the rates. The 55 occasion for doing this is urgent, and as the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, has the means it would be its greatest glory to teach the other Parishes of London the way in which they ought to live, as well as to let others live, on whose health and industry the wealth and splendour of this Parish depends. St. James's is now a Royal Parish in name; by providing decent homes for its ingenious, industrious, and hardly pressed working classes, it would be a Royal Parish indeed. I am, Rev. Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. Vesthy Hall, Piccadilly, June, 1868. APPENDIX containing page 1. Tables of Causes of Death 58 2.
