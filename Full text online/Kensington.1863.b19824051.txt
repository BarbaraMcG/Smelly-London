KEN 90 EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH (EXTRACT FROM THE VESTRY REPORT FOR MARCH, 1863 - MARCH, 1864 ) 51 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF KENSINGTON. Sanitary Department, Vestry Hall, Kensington. June, 1864, Gentlemen, I beg to present to you a short annual abstract on the condition of the health of the population of your parish; an account of the number of nuisances reported to you, and the remedial measures adopted for their removal or abatement. Special provisions have lately been introduced by Act of Parliament to endeavour to improve the general health of the people. Laws have been made with regard to the supervision of slaughter-houses, cow-yards, and bake-houses, as well as chemically analysing the gas consumed in our houses, with regard to its comparative freedom from sulphur, compounds, etc., injurious to health. In addition, an Act enabling vestries, etc., to appoint food analysts has been passed; but as this has not been found to be of much practical value, your Vestry has not adopted it. The Registrar-General has during the past year supplied me weekly with a correct account of the number of births and deaths, gratuitously. The total number of deaths has been— males. females. total. Brompton Ward 245 211 456 Town Ward 560 612 1172 805 823 1628 This shews an increase in the Brompton Ward of 12 over last year; and in the Town Ward an increase of 10, being a total increase of 22 D 2 52 in a population multiplying with great rapidity. Of this number, 142 occurred in the Consumptive Hospital, nearly all being non-parishioners. No deaths are returned from the Cancer Hospital, as it has been removed from Kensington into Chelsea parish. 113 paupers died in the Workhouse, viz., 53 males and 58 females. To compensate for this mortality, the number of births during the twelve mouths was— males. females. total. Brompton 257 225 482 Kensington 937 911 1848 1194 1136 2330 Giving a total gain to the parish of 702 in excess of deaths. Mortality for the Tear ending January 2, 1864.

The mortality has also been above the average from measles (83 and 30) and diarrhœa (54 and 21). 53 The number of infants who died under five years of age amounts to 684, or about 38 per cent. of the total deaths. During the year which ended March 25th, 1864, the following improvements were carried out, and proceedings taken under the Nuisance Removal Act:— Proceedings under Nuisance Removal Act. Total number of complaints made 471 Notices prepared and served 366 Summonses at Police Court 54 Magistrates orders made 33 Works done under summonses without orders 20 Drains, new pipe laid under Inspector's supervision, foot 845 „ repaired 48 „ cleansed only 34 „ trapped 19 „ entered into sewer 14 Sinks trapped 22 Privies cleansed and repaired 27 „ panned, trapped, and supplied with water 35 ,, dilapidated, abolished 5 „ new ones erected 4 Cesspools emptied 13 ,, new ones made where there are no sewers 4 „ abolished 7 Houses supplied with water 3 Dust bins or ash pits erected 23 Dung pits erected 15 Yards and stables repaved, or paving repaired 17 Dilapidated houses put in habitable condition 9 Rooms cleansed and whitewashed 494 Staircases and passages ,, 37 Ventilation of houses improved 15 Accumulations of dung, stagnant water, animal and other offensive matter, removed 117 Letters sent to owners requesting abatement of nuisances, about 50 Cases in which animals kept offensively have been removed 13 „ Inspector could not interfere 19 „ no orders made, for want of sewers 31 „ no orders made 9 „ referred to Surveyor 7 Unnecessary complaints 32 Notices served on pig-keepers 80 „ butchers for licensing slaughter-houses 63 „ cow-keepers for licensing cow-houses 59 Slaughter-houses licensed and under constant supervision 54 Cow-houses do. do. do. 52 Bake-houses do. do. do. 94 In addition to the above, great numbers of nuisances have been abated at the request of the Inspector, without being entered in the Report Book, or any legal proceedings being taken. 54 There are still a great many localities of this parish most imperfectly or not at all drained, and consequently very unhealthy, which cannot be much improved until new sewers are provided for them. Fifty-four slaughter-houses and 52 cow-sheds were licensed by the magistrates. These, as well as 94 bake-houses, are under the constant supervision of Mr. Lovett, the Inspector. In no instance has it been found necessary to seize food unfit for human consumption. I have during the past year analyzed the gas supplied to your parish by the Western Gas Company from time to time, and at different hours of the day and evening, and have given you a report from Mr. Berry, gas engineer, on the subject of lighting the public lamps; and in all cases, excepting once or twice, the gas has been found of sufficient illuminating power, and as chemically pure as required by the Act of Parliament. I have appended a table of the Mortality of the Population, according to their various professions and trades. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FRANCIS GODRICH, Medical Officer of Health.
