AC 432(3) ST MARY ISLINGTON ISL 36 REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF The Parish of Saint Mary Islington DURING THE YEAR 1867. by EDWARD BALLARD, M.D. (Lond.) member op the royal college op physicians; fellow op the royal medical and chirurgical society of london, etc. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. J & I. TIREBUCK, STEAM PRINTERS AND LITHOGRAPHERS, Monewell Street, E.C., and Islington. 1868. ANNUAL REPORT For 1 8 6 7. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, There can be no question that the year which we have last passed through has been a comparatively healthy one. So small a number of deaths has not been registered here since the year 1862. Omitting the deaths of persons from other districts taking place in hospitals, and also those occurring in the Clerkenwell Infant Poor House and West London Union Poor House, as not fairly to be counted amongst our own, the registered mortality of Islington for the fifty-two weeks ending December 28th, was 3760 deaths. In 1866 it was 4172 deaths. 1865 „ 3813 „ 1864 „ 3843 „ 1863 „ 3854 „ 1862 „ 3010 „ And yet our population may be regarded (if the rate of increase is the same as it was in the decenniad 1851-61) as augmented each year by an addition of a number of persons equal to five per cent. of the population of the previous year. But while we exclude from our calculation the deaths of strangers to our population occurring here, we ought to include a fair share of those occurring in the metropolitan hospitals, &c. The number of such deaths which I calculate we may take credit for (and this, I believe, is an extreme number) is 249. Adding these we arrive at a corrected mortality of 4009. I estimate our population, in the middle of 1867, at 200,541 persons; and hence our death-rate for the year may be regarded as 199 9 per 10,000 living. In 1866 it was 231.6, in 1865 it was 221.8, in 1864 it was 224, in 1863 it was 227, and in 1862 it was 200 in 10,100 living, nearly the same death-rate then as in 1867. In London generally last year the death-rate was 229.8, a lower rate than had prevailed during the five previous years. Still, it is to be observed, Islington maintains its position of comparative healthiness, notwithstanding that the density of its population has increased. The maintenance of its relative position is, with an increasing population, a result not to be overlooked. 4 The births registered during the year are represented in the following table WEST SUB-DISTRICT.

It gives a total of 34,692 cases. In 1866 the total was 35,430 cases, but that was the cholera year, when the number was swollen by cases of bowel affections. CAUSES OF DEATH AND SICKNESS. The causes which led to the death of 3760 persons appear upon Table I.; of these persons, 1873 were males and 1887 females. I pointed out on a former occasion that our female population was exceptionally large. A favourable aspect of this Table is afforded in observing the comparatively small number of deaths which are attributed to diseases of the so called zymotic class. Eight hundred and thirty-eight is a number which contrasts satisfactorily with 1127 deaths from these causes in 1866,1015 in 1865, 977 in 1864, 1356 in 1863, 849 in 1862, and 846 in 1861, especially when the smaller population in these years is considered. Small-pox occasioned 71 deaths, 32 in the west and 39 in the east sub-district. Of these persons thus cut off by a preventible disease, 46 were males and 25 females. In 1866 the number of deaths registered as from small-pox was 67; in 1865, 58; in 1864, 26; in 1863, 108 ; in 1862, 15; and in 1861, 6. Hence, since the great outbreak in 1863, small-pox has been gradually, year by year, claiming more and more victims amongst our residents. Is not this a fair subject for thought ? Ought it not to render us anxious, and lead us—to whom the legislature has entrusted the health and, to an extent, the lives of our fellow parishioners—to enquire whether we are doing all that we might or ought to do in their protection ? For it is not that A 5 small-pox kills a good many of those it attacks, but it disfigures nearly all, and sometimes lays the foundation for other maladies which sooner or later make their appearance. I will not refer to statistics gathered from outside our own boundary, but will ask simply what our own Tables tell us upon the subject. During the five years, 1863-7, 330 persons have died from small-pox, 140 of them in the first five years of their life, and 123 at 20 years of age and upwards, the remaining smaller proportion of 67 during the fifteen years of life between five years of age and twenty. Now I do not deny, and do not wish to deny, that generally our population is a vaccinated population ; were it not so, the disastrous year 1863, and the ravages of small-pox since would have been far more serious than they were. But, for all that, vaccination is not so universal as it ought to be. Of our poor child population about 10 per cent. is un-vaccinated up to the time of their leaving school, and we all know how careless people become afterwards in a matter which is popularly regarded as one which concerns children and not grown-up folk. And yet it does concern grown-up folk, or else why the large proportion of 123 out of 330 deaths happening at twenty years of age and upwards—not much less a number than the 140 dying from smallpox under five years of age. Nor do I deny, or wish to deny, that a goodly number of those who died from small-pox, especially amongst the adults, were vaccinated persons, but the larger number, especially amongst the children, had not been vaccinated at all. Indeed, this is one point that I desire rather to dwell upon, for it has been used as an argument in favour of not compelling parents to obtain for their children the protection of vaccination. Here, it may be said, is a number of persons, vaccinated in their infancy, who, notwithstanding their vaccination, catch small-pox and die from it. Why, then, insist upon the vaccination at all if it does not protect them from the very casualty which it is asserted to protect from ? But is it true that it does not protect? Will the adducing of any number of instances of fatal small-pox after vaccination prove that it does not protect unless it be known also how many persons have been vaccinated, and, under similar exposure, have escaped contagion? For it may turn out that of 1000 vaccinated persons, only a small proportion catch small-pox afterwards, and this for reasons which are quite easy of explanation; while out of another 1000 who have not been vaccinated, very many catch small-pox and die from it, while a much smaller proportion escape than of the vaccinated. And it may turn out on enquiry, moreover, that the disease, when, from some defect of the vaccination, from some influence of age, or from some peculiarity of individual constitution, it attacks the vaccinated, is a less serious and fatal disease than when it seizes upon the un-vaccinated. And what I have thus stated as possible is indeed the true statement of facts. There is an abundance of statistics, gathered from all parts of the world, to prove it so, if this were the place to adduce them. In one continental city, where an accurate record was kept for twenty-one years, it was found that one case of small-pox only occurred among each 367 vaccinated persons, while one case occurred among each 12 of un-vaccinated persons; and further, that while one fatal case occurred amongst each 7166 vaccinated persons, ono fatal case 6 occurred amongst each 40 of un-vaccinated persons. In an epidemic of small-pox that occurred in another city, where the number of vaccinated and un-vaccinated was known, it was found that while only 66 per cent. of the vaccinated took the disease, as many as 50 per cent. of the un-vaccinated took it. I merely mention these as two examples of the truth I am dwelling upon. If, then, I am asked why any vaccinated persons suffer at all on exposure? I reply, 1st: that the occurrence in a very small proportion of instances depends upon an exceptional proclivity on the part of some individuals to take the disease: such persons will suffer small-pox even after inoculation, or after having had. the disease a greater or less number of years previously. Such as these, even one attack of small-pox will not protect against a second, or even a third, much less can vaccination (which is merely small-pox modified by passing through the constitution of the cow) protect. 2nd: that about the age when adult age is attained there happens, from constitutional causes, a remarkable tendency to take small-pox, both on the part of the vaccinated and the un-vaccinated, who may hitherto have escaped attack, but even at this age vaccinated persons are comparatively protected by the vaccination they have undergone. 3rd: that besides this, the protection of vaccination given in infancy gradually wears out as age advances, and hence that an unknown proportion of such individuals are endangered. It is on this ground, as well as on that last mentioned, that I have from time to time urged in my monthly reports the necessity for having recourse to re-vaccination, and in periods of epidemic outbreaks have pressed upon our district vaccinators the desirableness of offering to adults in small-pox localities the renewal of their protection. 4th: that a great deal of the vaccination performed now a days is of a very imperfect character; partly this is the fault of the operator not being careful in the selection of the pocks from which he takes the virus, or in using preserved or dry virus in place of vaccinating from arm to arm. But there is an additional cause in the now indisputable fact, that the virus which has passed through some hundreds or thousands of human systems since it left the cow, has undergone in such transmission and repeated human generation, a degradation in its character and force. The vaccine disease, as produced by most practitioners now by arm to arm vaccination, is a much less virulent disease than it was when firBt inoculated by Dr. Jenner, or that it has proved itself where new sources have been opened on the occasional discovery of natural cases of cow-pox. Jenner contented himself with a single puncture with such virus, and was even then alarmed, although needlessly, at the local result produced; others, under similar circumstances, have contented themselves with two, whereas for the production of a satisfactory result with the virus mostly in use here, four or eight punctures are needed, and even then a less amount of constitutional disturbance follows the operation. Yet we find on examining the arms of vaccinated children, in place of scars which may be seen half across a long room, marks so poor and superficial left by the vaccination that close inspection may be needed to see them at all, and in place of four to eight pocks, possibly only one or two paltry vesicles raised by the operation. Can it bo wondered at then that the 7 reputation of a protective is endangered when the protective itself is not what it was when it was originally introduced ? There is but one remedy for this, namely, the occasional renewal of the stock of virus we use from the cow or heifer, and in the meantime the production, an a substitute for quality, of an increased number of pocks with the human vaccine. In Paris, all the public vaccinations are performed from the heifer. We have no arrangements for this here as yet. A paternal government presides there for the protection of its people. That we have no national provision of the sort here is part of the price we pay for our liberties. With us, every man does pretty much what seems right in his own eyes; Englishmen believe that on the whole the balance of advantage is on the side of their own system. I mention all this now, partly because it is a subject which has occupied a good deal of my thoughts during the past year, and partly because I have experienced an indisposition on the part of the Trustee Board to put in force their powers under the old Act of Parliament to enforce the vaccination of unprotected children. I have fancied that they might have felt something of a similar difficulty in administering the law that Parliament Beems to have felt in framing the Compulsory Vaccination Act, and I have thought that now that new powers are conferred upon them, some such brief statement of facts as I have given may possibly be of use in strengthening their hands for the work they are called upon to engage in. What I desire to see is the primary good vaccination of every infant born in the Parish or brought into it un-vaccinated, the re-vaccination of all on the attainment of the age of puberty, and an improvement in the quality of the virus in use. The first of these desiderata the Guardians of the Poor are fully empowered to insist upon, the second lies in the hands of the District Vaccinators in part, who might do much if they would bring some amount of zeal and devote a sufficient time to the work of vaccination amongst the poor, and in part in my own hands, by urging upon all the importance and necessity of re-vaccination; the third desideratum I see as yet no means of compassing, although I hope that I shall see my way to it before long. Measles has not been very prevalent during the year, only 336 cases are recorded upon the table, of sickness, and only 39 deaths altogether. On referring back to former tables, I find that the prevalence of measles amongst our population has abated every alternate year, during the past eight years, thus:— Deaths. Cases in Public Practice. 1860 113 572 1861 46 289 1862 123 740 1863 105 410 1864 129 719 1865 54 217 1866 152 894 1867 39 336 8 Scarlet Fever has been epidemic during the year; 144 deaths being recorded, and as many as 641 cases in the public practice of the Parish, nearly the same number as in the epidemic year, 1863. Still the mortality was less than in that year, since 144 deaths bear no comparison with the 392 that happened in 1863. We must believe that the disease, although about equally prevalent, was milder in its type and less fatal. The deaths and cases occurring year by year since 1860 have been as follows:— Deaths. Cases in Public Practice.  1860 135 253 1861 152 281 1862 210 321 1863 392 672 1864 174 293 1865 144 338 1866 116 282 1867 144 641 Hooping Cough has not troubled us so much as during the two former years, only 115 deaths of children having been recorded from this disease, and 330 cases altogether in the public practice of the Parish. The deaths and cases occurring year by year since 1860 have been as follows:— Deaths. Cases in Public Practice. 1860 92 304 1861 209 529 1862 112 304 1863 204 579 1864 108 314 1865 187 642 1866 220 709 1867 115 330 Except that wo had two consecutive epidemic years (1865-6), we observe hero again, as with measles, a remission of epidemic prevalence in alternate years. Fever (including in this term "Typhus," which never prevails with us to the extent that it does in some other parishes) has been less prevalent than it was in 1866. We have recorded 97 deaths and 223 cases in the public practice of the Parish. Year by year since 1860 they have been recorded as follows:— Deaths. Cases in Public Practice. 1860 76 152 1861 89 284 1862 115 348 1863 114 363 1864 105 261 1865 115 295 1866 125 353 1867 97 223 9 SANITARY WORKS OF THE YEAR. During the greater part of the period extending between Lady-day, 1867, and the same day this year, I have had the advantage of the alteration made in the Sanitary staff by the appointment of a Superintendent Inspector by the Vestry in April, 1867, in the place of one of the Inspectors who had resigned. Of the four Inspectors, three have since been daily engaged in out-of-door work, the Parish being divided as fairly as possible between them for this purpose. The fourth, Mr. Collingwood, the Superintendent, has been occupied in the office, and with his aid a system has been introduced which while regulating, recording, and checking effectually the work of the other three, has resulted in the accomplishment of an amount of work out of all proportion to the increase which was made in the staff in May, 1866. The records now kept have enabled me to present this year to the Vestry a table of Sanitary work more full of details than in former years. I think this table will be regarded with satisfaction, not only on this account, but because it exhibits results which confirm the wisdom of the alterations made. In addition to the Dwelling-house inspections, the Cow-sheds, Slaughter-houses, and Bakehouses are inspected at an appointed time every three or four months. The regulations adopted for the direction of the Inspectors, and the Superintendent's duties are in print, so that there is no necessity for my reproducing them here. One other point, however, I must mention, namely, that ever since the passing of the Sanitary Act and our outbreak of cholera, I have continued to carry out where necessary, and where I felt certain that the matter could not be safely left in the hands of the occupiers of poor tenements, the disinfections which the act alluded to directs to be done. The cost of this only amounts to a few shillings in the month and I am satisfied that it has resulted in a great deal of good. The only cases thus interfered with are those in which small-pox, scarlet fever, continued fever, or choleraic diarrhoea have occurred. The agents I have employed have been the carbolic acid and McDougal's powder, in which I believe every confidence is to be placed and which are more convenient for application than any others which have been proposed. My chief difficulty has been in dealing with articles of clothing, &c., which could not be washed. I have now, however, obtained one of Blake's Evaporisers, which will enable me to expose them for any length of time that may be desirable to the fumes of carbolic acid. Whether this will be effectual experience alone will demonstrate. At the annual licensing of Slaughter-houses and Cow-sheds, licences were refused on the opposition of the Vestry to four of the former and one of the latter. The number of Cows kept in the Parish was found to be 485, the number of licensed establishments being 63. No remarkable increase of Cow-keeping then has taken place since the discouragement arising from the cattle plague outbreak. New arrangements for the public supply of milk, made at that time, appear thus to have become permanent institutions. 10 It will doubtless have been observed that during the greater part of last year I have affixed to the notice board at the vestibule of the Hall, a daily record of meteorological observations, taken at nine o'clock every morning in my own garden from instruments, the accuracy of which has been tested at Greenwich. This record is not posted up merely to satisfy curiosity, although I am happy to think that even thus it may have gratified some of those who are pleased to consult it; and may lead to the cultivation amongst such of a taste for a very interesting and nationally important science. My chief object has been to record and announce events which occurring day by day, and week by week, have an influence upon public health which it is difficult to exaggerate. Such observations as these enable me, and will enable you when you read them in the light of those truths which I have been lately enunciating, and am still engaged in bringing out, to predict, within the limitations, imposed by certain contingences, and with the necessary allowance for unavoidable ignorance and error, the probable fluctuations of sickness in our population. The points to which my observations are confined are such as experience has shown me are those which can at present alone be made much use of with this object, I mean the fluctuations of atmospheric temperature, the range of temperature between the lowest at night and the highest during the day; the amount of moisturo held in suspension in the air, and the amount and frequency of rain-fall. This is a subject which I have been steadily engaged in studying almost from the first year of my appointment to my present office, although it was not until lately that I felt myself in a position to write or speak upon it with any degree of authority. Some diagrams which have been suspended in the Library illustrate the following facts, which are more fully set forth numerically in the pamphlet upon the "Influence of weather upon sickness," which I have also had the pleasure to place upon your shelves. 1. That an increase of atmospheric temperature is normally associated with an increase of general sickness. 2. That a decrease of atmospheric temperature is normally associated with a diminution of general sickness. 3. That for the most part the increase or decrease of sickness is proportional in amount to the extent to which the atmospheric temperature rises or falls. 4. That it is an error to suppose (as is popularly held) that sudden changes in temperature are (as a rule) damaging to public health. A sudden change from cold to hot weather is indeed very damaging; but a sudden change from hot to cold is one of the most favourable circumstances that can occur when sickness is regarded broadly as respects a large population. 5. That, remarkably enough, these influences are most marked in the directions I have mentioned in the colder seasons of the year, and more certain in the winter than in the summer. 11 6. That rises and falls of temperature are more certain and effectual in their special operation upon public health, when at the same time the daily range of temperature is lessened, than they are when the daily range is at the same time increased; rises of temperature increasing sickness more certainly and markedly, and falls of temperature decreasing it more certainly and markedly. 7. That a fall of rain lessens sickness generally, sometimes immediately, sometimes after a short interval, and that as a rule the reduction of general sickness is greater when the fall of rain is heavy than when it is light. 8. That drought on the other hand, tends to augment general sickness. 9. That wet weather in the summer season operates more certainly in improving public health than it does in the winter season. The influence of atmospheric humidity I have not yet had time completely to make out. The task is one of immense labour, involving a very large amount of calculation. At present, therefore, I prefer to say nothing about it. My impression, however, is that on the whole it will be found that atmospheric humidity exercises a regulating influence upon the operation of temperature, something allied to that which it is known by scientific men to exert upon the temperature of the earth itself. The value of these deductions may be estimated in some degree, when I tell you that they are based upon the record of more than 217,000 cases of sickness, which I have gathered during the past years from the books of your district Medical Officers, and of the institutions for the relief of the sick in our Parish. I must, however, give one other warning, namely, that what I here say about sickness is not at once applicable to mortality. Weather that lessens sickness amongst the healthy, may, and under certain circumstanccs does, tend to hasten the death of those who are sick, and vice-versd. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your very obedient servant, EDWARD BALLARD. April 28th, 1868. TABLE I, DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Residents West. East.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JANUARY, 1867. No. CXVII. A severe frost set in on the last day of the old year, commencing on Monday, December 31. The lowest temperature 6.6° was reached in the early hours of Saturday, January 5th; but in the course of the next day the frost suddenly broke up, and a temperature of 43.7° was reached. The mean temperature of January 7th was 49.2°; and from this day the temperature very gradually became lowered, until the frost re-commenced on Saturday the 12th. It continued, but with less severity than before, until the 22nd, when it again suddenly broke up, the temperature rising 10 degrees between 7.30 p.m. and midnight. A frost like this, with such sudden variations of atmospheric temperature, could not have been without result upon the public health and mortality. Throughout London the mortality was increased, but it is somewhat remarkable, that putting our hospital mortality out of consideration, the deaths in the four weeks of January here have not quite reached the corrected average. The registered mortality was 372, and the corrected mean of 10 previous years is 380. A great many old persons however have been carried off—83 between 60 and 80 years of age, and 15 above 80 years. One of the latter was an old lady aged 91 years. Ninety-three of the deaths proceeded from diseases of the organs of respiration (exclusive of those from consumption). 2 The zymotic diseases which have furnished the greatest number of deaths are small-pox 15, only one of which was the death of a female; scarlet fever 17, hooping cough 18, and fever 10. Fifteen deaths have been registered as due to apoplexy, a number twice as large as has been registered in any January for the last 10 years. I regret to say that a renewed outbreak of cattle plague has occurred in the sheds of Mrs. Nicholls in the Liverpool Road, the first case happening on January 27th. The stock has all been slaughtered, a proceeding it is to be hoped will prevent the extension of the disease. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, February 4th, 1867.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR FEBRUARY, 1867. No. CXVIII. The mortality of the parish during the month of February has again been below the average. The number of deaths of residents which were registered is 314, while the corrected mean of the corresponding period for ten years is 334. Small-Pox has continued to prevail extensively, more so even than in the month of January. An outbreak in some gipsies' tents in Upper Holloway, gave us some trouble at the close of last month; but, at last, the father of the family being attacked, they were all got away into the Small-Pox Hospital, but not before much alarm had occurred in the neighbourhood, and the Sanitary Act had been put in operation. A serious outbreak of Typhus has also occurred in the Irish Courts, which has been traced to the removal of the body of a Typhus patient from the Hospital to Swan-yard, where a wake was held; several of those attending it being seized with the disease and spreading it in their own houses. Diarrhœal affections do not appear to be more prevalent then usual, but there is every reason, in face of the fact that Cholera has been lingering about England during the winter, and is now prevalent in the Island of Jersey, to push forward all requisite sanitary works.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR MARCH, 1867. No. CXIX. The general mortality of our district during the past month has on the whole been less than that of March for several years past. Three hundred and ninety-nine deaths were registered, the numbers in the corresponding weeks of the last four years being 422, 406, 382, and 452. The mean corrected mortality of the same weeks during the ten previous years was 429, so that the deaths this year have been thirty less than had a similar mortality prevailed. I am sorry to observe, however, that small-pox still continues to prevail extensively, especially in some of the streets adjoining the Essex Road and at Balls Pond. I have communicated with the District Vaccinators in these localities, and they tell me they are doing all in their power to induce the people to avail themselves of the protection offered them; but with so dense a population, and so large, and other work to attend to, the utmost efforts that these gentlemen are capable of making are insufficient to meet the emergency. There is no doubt that, in any place where small-pox breaks out, the epidemic may be extinguished by active vaccination of the inhabitants—the thing has been done over and over again—but for this purpose a sufficiency of assistance should be provided, and those engaged in the task should be entirely devoted to their work, and visit from house to house; and this involves expense. The question simply is whether the object justifies the outlay, and this question it is for the Trustees to decide. During the last four months there have been forty-four deaths from small-pox, and as the mortality of that disease is estimated at one in ten cases, this means that during the period referred to 440 cases have occurred in the parish at large. I have a record of 175 of them. 2 The deaths from fever have fallen from eleven in four weeks to ten in five weeks. The cold weather and easterly winds which we have suffered from during the month have had the effect of raising our deaths from respiratory diseases to 104. The general amount of sickness has been excessive, and cases of diarrhœa have been more frequent than they usually are in the month of March. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR APRIL, 1867. No. CXX. The low mortality observed in March has continued to prevail through April. The registered deaths were 253, a number which is 73 below the mean mortality of the ten previous years. There were seven deaths from Small-pox—equivalent at the current rate of fatality of this disease to 70 cases scattered amongst our population. Some houses in the parish suffer severely. Thus in Mildmay-avenue it has been spreading from house to house, and from room to room. This is the place where it will be recollected Typhus was so severe a year or two ago. It is densely populated by a poor class of persons, and I observe that an attempt is being made by the owner to build it in still more closely at the rear, in a manner which I believe to be at variance with the law. I sincerely hope that the Vestry will oppose this proceeding. Three cases of very severe Choleraic Diarrhoea, one passing into imperfect collapse (which I saw) have been reported to me during the month. Two were in very suspicious quarters, and I took measures at once for the disinfection of the drains and privies throughout the neighbourhoods. I also sent a circular to the District Medical Officers, requesting the earliest information of any similar cases. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, May 14th, 1867.

The month of May this year has been distinguished by its very small mortality. The number of deaths registered did not exceed 228, the mean corrected mortality of the previous ten years being 305. The general sickness, however, has been considerable for May, the total number of new cases recorded being 2503. Among them were 33 cases Small-pox and 69 of Diarrhoea. As the hot weather appears to be now setting in, I think it is desirable that the disinfection of the sewers and gulley openings in the streets with carbolic acid should be repeated as a precautionary measure. I have arranged for the use of carbolic acid in the privies and closets in neighbourhoods affected last year with Cholera. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical OJJicer of Health.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JUNE, 1867. No. CXXII. The mortality of the past month has been again exceptionally low, only 300 deaths were registered, whereas 350 would have been registered had the death-rate of June for the past 10 years prevailed. As is not unusual at this season of the year, small-pox has receded somewhat, but cases of scarlet fever have become more frequent; but not at all in excess of what is customary. The cool nights which have succeeded warm days seem also to have kept diarrhoea in check, the number of cases of bowel complaints recorded during the month not being more than 122 and 7 deaths. A case of Infantile cholera, rapidly fatal, in Pickering Street (which will be tabulated in July,) was followed up by thorough disinfection with carbolic acid, &c. of the clothing and rooms, and has induced me to repeat the precautionary disinfections of closets, &c., in suspicious localities. As the season of last year's outbreak is approaching, I feel that it is desirable that no practicable precautions should be left unused. Householders generally should see that their cisterns and water butts are thoroughly cleansed, and that dust and refuse are not allowed to accumulate upon their premises. By the adoption of such measures as these in each district of London, we may hope to escape a repetition of last year's calamity. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health.

MARY, ISLINGTON, FOE, JULY, 1867. No. CXXIII. We have just passed through, a July remarkable for its extraordinary weather, and especially for the lowness of atmospheric temperature. In the first week it is true the mean temperature at Greenwich was half a degree above the average; but in the second week it was 1.9 degrees, in the third 3.1 degrees, and in the fourth 25 degrees below the average. Very little rain fell in the first two weeks, but in the third I measured a total fall of l.48 inches, there being only one day on which no rain fell; and in the fourth week I measured a total fall of 2.36 inches, of which 2.22 inches fell on one day, July 26th, with a shifting of the wind from South to North and North-east, and some thunder. The greater part of this, namely 2.02 inches, fell between midnight and 10 a.m. At Greenwich 3.67 inches were measured on that day, 3.18 inches being measured up to 10 o'clock. This is said to be the greatest amount of rain-fall ever recorded within 24 hours at the Observatory. It is a general rule which I have deduced from accurate observations now carried on for over ten years in this Parish, that such a reduction of atmospheric temperature, and such heavy rain-falls, especially in the summer season, exercise a most beneficial influence upon the public health. The number of deaths registered in the course of the four weeks, amounted only to 248, the corrected mean mortality of July for 10 years past being 326. The deaths from what is termed the zymotic class of diseases were only 61, the numbers for nine years previously in July being 80, 99, 45, 74, 68, 136, 103, 166, 104. There were only 26 deaths registered from diarrhœa, and seven from choleraic diarrhœa; the latter I have, in accordance with the custom, tabulated under the designation of cholera. All seven were infants under one year of age. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, August 3rd, 1867. TABLE I.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR AUGUST, 1867. No. CXXIV. The registered number of deaths in Islington during the month of August was 284. The mean mortality of the corresponding four weeks during ten years past being 302. Of the 284 deaths, 167 took place under twenty years of age; 137 under two years. Of the last-mentioned number, 42 were deaths from diarrhoea. Altogether, there were 44 deaths from diarrhosa, and 2 from sporadic cholera, or choleraic diarrhoea. This number is not excessive. Three hundred and twenty-six cases of diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera (bowel complaints) have come under observation at the several institutions which furnish me with returns—a number smaller than was observed in 1864, 1863, and 1861. There has been a good deal of general sickness among the poor; 2831 cases of all kinds having been recorded. With the exception of last year, the highest number of cases in August which I have yet noted, was 2722 in 1863. There is a feature in the mortality table worthy of remark, namely, the large proportion of 45 deaths attributed to diseases of the nervous system—I have never yet recorded more than 31 in August. Out of the 45 deaths, 21 were of infants under 2 years of age, and of these, 17 are referred to convulsions. I have never yet recorded more than 9 deaths in any August from infantile convulsions. The excess was probably due to a peculiarity in the meteorological conditions of the season. One remarkable fact at any rate is, that each of these 17 deaths occurred on days when the barometer was comparatively high, or had been so on the day preceding the death.

The mortality of the parish during the five weeks ending September 28th has been less by 20 deaths than the mean mortality (corrected) of the corresponding weeks for ten years past. Three hundred and thirtythree deaths were registered, of which 117 were referred to diseases of the zymotic class. The recorded sickness, as occurring in the practice of the several institutions which furnish me with returns, amounted to 3435 cases, a number which is undoubtedly unusually high for September. The zymotic maladies which have added most largely both to the sickness and mortality, have been diarrhœal affections and scarlet fever, which last, during the past month, has exhibited a special tendency to revive amongst us. The prevalence of bowel complaints may partly have been due to the comparatively high temperature which prevailed in the early weeks of the month, but this will of itself scarcely account for the large number of 386 cases found upon the sickness table and the 73 deaths (two stated as due to choleraic diarrhoea) found upon the mortality table. The corrected mean mortality from diarrhœa, dysentery, and cholera, in the ten previous Septembers is 36, that is half the number of deaths registered this year. In fact the mortality from bowel complaints (although 25 cholera deaths were counted in) in September last year only amounted to 51. 2 With regard to scarlet fever, I have this to say, that while little is at present known about the conditions, atmospheric or otherwise, which determine its revival from time to time in a population, thus much is certain, that it does not arise spontaneously—no disease of its class ever does. The seeds of the malady—something given off from a person suffering under it—are always present; isolated cases are never wanting in the metropolis. The human systems constituting a population may be regarded as the soil in which the seed is capable of expanding, vivifying and reproducing its like; but on the one hand the soil is not always in a condition to favour the process, nor on the other are atmospheric conditions always such as to permit of the maintenance of the vitality of the seed, or to promote its germination. From time to time, however, the necessary conditions arc present, and then an outbreak of scarlatina occurs. There is nothing in this which is not in accordance with the analogy of nature. Up to the present time medical science has not determined, with any precision, what the necessary conditions for an outbreak are; but, standing upon the everlasting mundane truth that e nihilo nihil fit, it declares absolutely and infallibly that a germ must exist and be somehow introduced into the human system before scarlatina as a disease can manifest itself therein. And experience supports the dictum. Here then is a truth with important practical bearings ! If we do not know with exactness what the condition of the system is which causes the germ of scarlatina to be inoperative at one time and at another time favours its operation on the body, we know, at any rate, that it is the duty of all who would check the spread of the disease to do their utmost to destroy the vitality of the germs given off from the sick, and to prevent, as far as possible, their gaining access to other human systems. There is no reason whatever to believe that ordinary local conditions of unwholesomeness, except in so far as they favour the retention of the germs of the malady, as dirtiness in a habitation, or favour personal intercourse with the sick, as crowding and bad ventilation, have any close connection with the outbreak of the malady anywhere, although there is abundant evidence that all of them do more or less influence the final result in death or recovery of any individual case. Hence, taking a practical view of the subject, it is obvious that the provisions of the old Nuisances Removal Act are mainly of use to us in combating scarlet fever by enabling us to enforce general 3 cleanliness, and to promote a better ventilation of places where from other circumstances the disease is most likely to spread. The crowding of many families into a house (I am not speaking of what is commonly called oner-crowding) it is beyond our power to rectify; we must take such things as we find them. But, are we therefore powerless ? Certainly not. In the first place, wherever it can be effected, every case that occurs in a family might be isolated. Amongst the poor the proper thing to do is to remove the patient to the hospital, and I have written to all the District Medical Officers urging this step upon them where it is practicable to take it. Next, it is quite possible in the majority of instances, to remove from the sick apartment all superfluous woollen or textile matters, such as carpets, curtains, &c., which are likely to retain the germs of the disease. These two measures of precaution cannot be taken or put in force too early in any case. A suspicious sore throat should at least lead to the prohibition of communicati6n with persons who have not had the disease. In the third place, the germs of the malady given off from the sick should be followed up by disinfectants, by the use of means adapted to destroy their vitality. And here comes the grand difficulty. In cholera we know where to find the germs, namely, in the discharges which we can see and often collect; in scarlatina they are diffused into the atmosphere and attach themselves everywhere. Hence the difficulty of extirpating infection in a house once contaminated by scarlatina. Still measures of disinfection should be used as early, as thoroughly, and as extensively as possible. Of all the trustworthy agencies for the disinfection of rooms, perhaps the most convenient is carbolic acid, which may be sprinkled upon the floors, even when the patient is in the apartment, and with which all parts of the room may be washed as well as the furniture after his removal, and prior to cleansing and limewhiting. Clothing, bedding, &c., are best disinfected by dry heat, but where this is not practicable (as unfortunately it is not in Islington) all such articles as are to be washed might be soaked for a time in a dilute solution of the same substance. Accordingly it is this which, under the powers given by the Sanitary Act, we are attempting now. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, October, 1867. TABLE I.

A comparatively low mortality has again characterised the last four weeks, the number of deaths registered being 260, while 297 would have been registered had the ordinary death-rate of October prevailed. Thirteen deaths were registered from Scarlatina. Referring to the Sickness Table, we find that cases of small-pox and scarlatina have been more abundant than during September,, otherwise, there is no cause for dissatisfaction with the state of the public health.

The mortality of the Parish has continued throughout November to be below the average. Three hundred and nine deaths were registered— the mean corrected mortality of November daring the last ten years being 339. Scarlet fever has been prevailing a good deal during the month, but not to such an extent as in October. The number of deaths, however, have risen from 13 to 25 (as registered), but this is because deaths are not always registered immediately they occur, and they refer to persons many of whom were taken ill in the previous month. The small number of deaths, viz.: 26, referred to diseases of the nervous system is worthy of remark. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, December 2nd, 1867. TABLE I.

REPORT on the SANITAHY CONDITION OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON, FOE, DECEMBER, 1867. No. CXXVIII. We have this year passed through a very cold and inclement December. The five weeks to which this report relates include the week ending Nov. 30th. In that week the frosts commenced which, with little variation, have lasted ever since. Compared with previous years, the cold has been extreme: in the first week it was 3.5°, in the second 6.4°, in the third 2.5°, and in the fifth 0.5° below the average of the corresponding weeks for 50 years past. (Glaisher.) The effect of such weather upon the mortality has been, while keeping down the deaths from the zymotic class of maladies, to augment very largely those from diseases of the chest, which indeed exhibit twice the number of those registered in November. One hundred and sixty-five deaths from respiratory disease appear upon this month's table; whereas, the numbers registered in the previous ten years were 55, 104, 70, 8.3, 63, 70, 81 (corrected), 94, 78, 75. The average of these corrected for increase of population would be 101 deaths. The only zymotic disease which the coldness of the weather has appeared to have rendered more fatal to our population is small pox, the deaths from which have risen from 4 in November to 10. Still, after all, the balance of results was not very unfavourable, for the total of deaths that were registered, 460, is nearly the mean corrected number of deaths taking place during ten previous years.
