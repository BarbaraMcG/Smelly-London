LONDON HYDRAULIC POWER COMPANY. Notice having been given by the Engineers and General Managers of the London Hydraulic Power Company of the intention of that Company to lay main in those portions of Upper East Smithfield and Dock Street, within the limehouse District, as shewn in the tracing accompanying the Notice, I had several interviews with the Engineers of the Company, and arranged with them and the Surveyor of the Whitechapel District Board, that the main should he laid on the south instead of the north side of Upper East Smithfield, and close to the kerb on the west side of Dock Street. The plan originally submitted by the Company with regard to the main proposed to be laid in Nightingale l. me, Wapping, shewed the situation of the main to be about the centre of the roadway, but finding that much injury was being done to the carriageway, which had been lately repayed, by the Company's works, 1 suggested that the new main should be put under the footway instead of under the carriageway. The Company thereupon submitted an amended plan, to which the consent of the Board was given, and my suggestion was carried into effect. The mains have been laid in Upper East Smithfield, Dock Street, Nightingale Lane, and in High Street, Wapping, to a point opposite Sharp's Wharf, and the work of continuing the mains to the Company's premises near the old entrance to the London Docks is proceeding. SALE OF SURPLUS LANDS AT WAPPINC. The question of the disposable of the surplus land on the north side of High Street, Wapping, opposite Gun Dock, having been brought under the notice of the Board, it was decided to sell the same by auction. The price realized for the land was £850. DR. BARNARDO'S HOMES, STEPNEY CAUSEWAY. Application was made on behalf of Dr. Bernardo for permissions to construct an underground store-room for bread, in connection with the kitchen of the Boy Home, which formed (tart of the basement of No. 18, Stepney Causeway. The Works Committee having inspected the premises, the Board granted the application upon certain condition*, and upon payment of a nominal rent of £5 per annum. SNOW STORM. In consequence of a fall of snow which took place on the 7th December, and the subsequent thaw, 24 of the men in the employ of the Hoard were engaged until all out 7 p.m., the cost of the extra labor being £2 la. l0d. 0n the following day (Sunday) 10 men were employed in the early part of the morning cleansing the footways and forming crossings, the cost being £1. STREET NOMENCLATURE, ETC. A letter was received from the Superintending Architect of the London County Council stating that the Postmster General had made the following suggestions with regard to the names of streets in the District, viz. :— That Rhodeswell Road, Limehouse; Ann's Place, Jamaica Place; and Aun'a Place, Salmon Lane, ho renamed. That Elizabeth Place be incorporated with Hum Street. That Henry Street bo incorporated with Clenence Street. That Henry Street, York Square, be renamed.

James Street, John Street, Ohren's Court, and Pslmer Street, Ratcliff; Smith Street, Wapping; and Star Street, Shadwell, be renamed. The matter is under consideration. DISTURNPIKED ROADS. In March, 1889, a letter was received from the London County Council calling attention to the provisions of Section 11 of the Local Government Act 1888, with reference to the maintenance of certain roads disturnpiked since 1870, and requesting to be informed of the views of the Hoard as to the future arrangement between the Council and the Hoard of the duties rights and responsibilities conferred and imposed by the Section referred to as regards so much of Commercial Road, East and West India Dock Roads, and Horseferry Branch Road, as are situated in the Limehouse District. In reply the Council were informed that the Board were of opinion that the roads in question should be in future maintained by the Board subject to an arrangement for the payment to the Board by the Council of the cost of maintenance. A letter was also received from the County Council asking for the following information respecting the disturnpiked roads in the District, viz. :—(1) As to the points of commencement and termination of such portions of the roads as are in this District; (2) As to the materials of which they are formed ; (3) As to their present condition ; and (4) The annual cost of maintenance. As requested by the Hoard I prepared a Report embodying such information, and a copy thereof was seat to the County Council. On the 26th June, 1889, a resolution was passed to the following effect: "That the Hoard do claim to retain the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing the main roads in the District disturnpiked since 1870, viz.: The Commereial Road, a portion of the East India Dock Road and of the West India Dock Road, and the Horseferry Branch Road, and that the London County Council be applied to for an annual payment towards the cost of the maintenance and Repairs and reasonable improvement of such roads, the annual payment to be based on the present estimated cost of maintenance, including renewal.' A copy of such resolution was sent to the Council, and a formal claim made in accordance therewith. On the 15th February, 1890, the Council wrote that, upon receiving a report by it's Engineer, at required by the Act, that the roads had been properly maintained and repaired, they would be prepared to pay towards the cost of such maintenance, Ac., in the year 1889 90, the sum of £487, being the0 same as that paid to the Hoard by the Government in respect of each of the two preceding years. The offer was considered by the Hoard, and I reported that 1 estimated the cost of the maintenance, Ac., at £2,600 per annum, and it was thereupon decided to inform the Council that in the opinion of the Hoard the sum offered was inadequate, and the Hoard therefore declined to accept it and called upon the Council to undertake the repair and maintenance of the Disturnpiked Roads in the District as from 31st March, 1890. MAINTENANCE OF MAIN ROADS. A Conference of Delegates appointed by the Poplar, W liitechapel, and Limehouse District Hoards, and tho Vestries of Mile End Old Town, Bethual Green, and St. George-in-the-East, took place in April and May, 1889, and the following resolutions were passed :— " (1) That in the opinion of this Conference the District Boards and Vestries of the East of the Metropolis should make immediate application to the County Council for orders declaring certain Highways in their respective Districts, where the through traffic is larger and more important than the local traffic, to be main roads under the Local Government (England and Wales) Act 1888, and this conference is further of opinion that the County Council should make such orders accordingly." " (2) That in the opinion of this conference it is expedient that the District Boards and Vestries represented should claim to retain the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing the main roads within their respective Districts, and that the London County Council should contribute towards the cost of the maintenance and repair and reasonable improvement connected with the nisiutenance and repair of such roads. A copy of the foregoing resolutions, and a copy of my report as to the roads in the District which I considered should come under the definition of main roads (and which is reform to in my last Annual Report) were sent to the London County Council with a request that an order might be made declaring the roads specified in such report to be main roads. LONDON COAL & WINE DUES. Circular letters having been received from the Vestries of St. George Hanover Square, St. Martin-in-the Fields, and Padding ton, with copy resolutions passed by those bodies respectively in favor of the continuance of these dues, the Board resolved as follows :—"That it appears to this Board to be unwise and contrary to the interest of the rate payers of the Metropolis that the revenue of the London County Council should be prejudiced by the abolition of the London Coal and Wine Dues until some substitute has been found to supply their place; and that Her Majesty's Government lie requested to sanction the continuance of such Duos for a limited period." A copy of the resolution was sent to the Rt. Hon W. H. Smith, M P., First Lord of the Treasury. ARTIZANS' AND LABORERS' DWELLINGS ACTS. On the 17th February last, the Medical Officer made Reports to the Board under the provisions of the Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act, 1868. and the Acts amending the same, with regard to the condition of Nos. 55, 57, and 61, Brook Street, Ratcliff, and No. 4, Ropemaker's Fields, Limehouse, and in accordance with Sec. 6 of the 31 and 32 Victoria c. 130, such Reports were referred to mo for report as to the evils referred to therein and the remedy for the same. I reported accordingly, and copies of the Reports of the Medical Officer and myself were furnished to the owners of the several promises with notice of the time and place appointed by the Roard for the consideration thereof. The matter is still pending. THE GUINNESS TRUST. Sir E. Guinness having placed in the hands of Trustees a sum of £250,000 to be devoted to the provision of Dwellings for the Labouring Classes in London and Dublin, a letter was by direction of the Board addressed to the Rt. Hon. C. T. Ritchie, M P one of the Trustees, calling his attention to the preesing necessities of the District under the control of the Hoard, and pointing out that there were two vacant areas in the District which were cleared by the Metropolitan Roard of Works under Cross's Act, in consequence of the representations of the Medical Officer. FLOODING AFTER STORMS. In May, 1889, I submitted tracings (furnished by the London County Council) of the detail plans shews the construction of the flood works carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works in Turner's Road, ill the Limehouse District, and in St. Paul's Road, in Mile Eed, for preventing future flodings in the locality in case of heavy storms. The Board passed a resolution to the effect that in consequence of the acknowledged neglect of the Metropolitan Hoard serious loss had been entailed upon ratepayers in this District, and expressing the opinion that the sufferers had a fair claim to reasonable compensation. A copy of such resolution together with a statement as to the premises which had been flooded was sent to the County Council. A report which I prepared detailing the floodings which took place from time to time since 1874, was also sent to the Council, with a request that they would take the unfortunate circumstances of the persons who had sustained loss and damage by the Hoods into their favourable consideration. In July, 1889, I made a further report upon the subject, of Which a copy was furnished to the County Council, as follows.— " It having been started that one cause of the flooding was that the depth of the basement and lowest floors of the several Premies flooded were below the inverts of the sowers, I have made enquiries, and I find the depth of the sewer opposite 281, Burdett Road, from the street level to the invert, is 8 ft 4 in , and the depth of the floor of the breakfast room is 3ft ; opposite 49. Locksley Street the depth of the sewer from the street level to the invert is 11ft, and the depth of the floor of the cellars 7 ft. 2-in ; opposite 19, Turner's Road the depth of the sewer from the street level to the invert is 10 ft 8-in., and the depth of the floor of the cellar 6 ft. These facts prove that the sewers are sufficiently deep to properly drain the lowest floors of the premises, and that the floodings arise from the sewer being charged with storm water sufficiently high to force the water back into the basement through the drains. When the main drainage sower was constructed through Limehouse it was necessary to divert the sewer at the Cut Bridgein Bow Common Lane into the low-level sewer. This was done by constructing a new ewer by the side of the old one, and forming a curved communication between the two. There was a storm outlet at the Cut Bridge, which was removed when the new sewer was constructed. I am of opinion that the new sewer is not sufficient to discharge the Storm water into the low level sewer, but in consequence of the sharp turn the storm water is dammed back, flood the local sewere, and forces the water and sewage through the drains into the lowest floor an 1 yards of the adjoining houses. Also that sufficient communications should be made between the local sowers and the main sewer, to as to effect the desired object, and that if a storm outlet could he constructed to discharge the storm water into the Lee Cut much advantage would be gained, and the probability of flooding very much diminished. An important point is that on the last occasion of flooding the main sewer was charged up to within 16 feet of the surface with water. This shows that there must be some defective arrangement at the pumping station at Abbey Mills. It follows that when the main sewer is charged with sewage to such a height the proper and effectual discharge of sewage from the local and branch sewers must be seriously interfered with." No reply having been received from the County Council to the several communications, in January 1890 their attention was again called to the matter; but up to the present time no steps have been taken with regard thereto. VENTILATION OF SEWERS. Complaints having been received as to the great nuisance caused by the emanation of noxious effluvia from the gulleys aud ventilators of the main sewer in the East End District, I made a report upon the subject, of which the following is an extract:— " I would remind the Board that when the Metropolitan Board deodorized the main sewers in various parts of the District the result was that in those years the District was entirely free from bad smells The practice was discontinued in 1887, and the District has been exposed to the nuisance since, not to so great an extent last year inasmuch as it was a very wet year, which to a certain extent moderated the evil. As, however, it is likely from appearances to be a hot and dry summer this year, I would suggest that a communication be addressed to the London County Council urging them to return to the principle of deodorizing the main sewers at various points in the East End District as was done in l885 and 1886 by the Metropolitan Board. I understand that if this course is adopted it will be unnecessary to spend so much money at the Barking Outfall as at present, inasmuch as a large portion of the sewage will be deodorized before it reaches Barking. I also learn that in consequence of the largely reduced price of disinfectants the cost this year, if carried out. will be much less than in previous years It should not be forgotten that the sewage of the West End of London passes through the East End, and by the time it reaches the Limehouse District noxious gases to a serious extent are generated. At the West End they will necessarily be to a certain extent free from any such nuisance." A letter was addressed to the County Council embodying the suggestion contained in such report, and in consequence of the continuance of the nuisance a further letter was sent in September urging the Council to adopt a system of deodorization. In reply a letter dated 19th December, 1889, was received from the Council stating that the Council was not then prepared to consider the question of deodorizing the main sewers in the District; but that, with regard to a complaint by Messrs. Reddaway & Martin, of effluvia from the main sewer in Narrow Street, Ratcliff, directions had been given for the erection of a ventilating pipe of sufficient area in front of their premises ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notices were received dated 28th June, 1889, from the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, and the London Electric Supply Corporation, to the effect that it intended to make application in the ensuing session, under the Electric Lighting Acts 1882 and 1888. for provisional orders for power to. supply electricity for lighting and other purposes in certain street*. to be thereafter more particularly specified, within the Limehouse District The notices were not proceeded with. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS. In April 1889, a resolution was passed to the following effect:—"That this Board is of opinion that the whole of the scheme for the formation of a tunnel under the Thames at Blackball, a.s provided for under the provision of the Act of Parliament upon the subject, should be proceeded with at once." A copy of the resolution was sent to the East and South London District Boards and Vestries, with an invitation to join in a deputation to the County Council upon the subject. The Deputation waited upon the Bridges Committee of the Council on the 6th June. Subsequently the Board presented a petition to the Council praying that the Blackwall Tunnel might he proceeded with, and pointing out that the early completion thereof would be of inestimable advantage to the Districts affected, and through them to the whole of the Metropolis. PUBLIC GARDENS, ETC. A letter was received from the Earl of Meath, Chairman of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, calling attention to the fact that that Association had laid out and maintained three grounds entirely open to the public within the jurisdiction of this Board, viz.:— 1. The Churchyard of St. Dunstan's, Stepney. 2. Ihe churchyard of St. Anne's, Limehouse. 3. I lie churchyard of St. Paul's, Shadwell. Also pointing out that it was impossible for an Association supported entirely by voluntary contributions, if it was to take up fresh work, to permanently pay for the upkeep of any grounds, and asking whether the Board would be prepared to accept the maintainance of the churchyards under the provisions of the Open Spaces Acts of 1881 and 1887, the cost thereof being estimated at rather over £300 per annum. Having communicated with the Churchwardens of Stepney, Limchouse, and Shadwell, the Hoard directed that the Karl of Meath be informed that the Hoard was not prepared to accept the charge of the grounds in question. In October a further letter was received from the Secretary of the Association stating that the Association had for some time been making efforts to get rid of the yearly burden of maintenance entailed, and had approached the London County Council open the subject, and there was reason to believe the Council would undertake the work, and the Association asked the Hoard to communicate with the Council in favour thereof. The Hoard having decided to support the request of the Public Gardens Association, a letter was addressed to the County Council stating that the Board was of opinion that it was very desirable that the churchyards referred to should be kept as open spaces; but that the cost and expense should be a charge against the Metropolis generally, and that the Hoard would be glad to learn that the Council had determined to undertake the future maintainance at the cost of the Metropolis. TRAMWAYS. As requested by the Hoard I communicated with the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, as to duplicating the tram lines in Commercial Road, opposite Limehouse Church, so as to prevent the great inconvenience and delay caused to the traffic by the cars stopping at each end of the single line. After a long correspondence with the Company and their Engineer upon the subject, the Company offered to duplicate the tramway in question at their own cost, and also to pay the Hoard the sum of £200 for the concession. The Hoard gave permission for the work to be carried out upon the following terms, viz. (1) That the sum of £200 be paid to the Board before the new tramways were commenced; (2) That the work be done under the directions and to the satisfaction of the Surveyor of the Hoard ; (3) That the Company repave the whole width of the road where interfered with by the new tramways; and (4) That the Company pay the reasonable charges of the Surveyor for superintending the work. The Secretary of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company gave notice dated 30th May, 1889, that after the expiration of 10 days from the service of such notice, or so soon after as the approval of the Board of Trade should have been obtained, it was the intention of the Company to commence the construction of the tramways in Leman Street and Dock Street, authorised by the North Metro politan Tramways Order 1888, and in accordant with drawings of the permanent way and substructure proposed to be used, which accompanied such notice. The Board of Trade were informed that this Board had no objection to the construction of the tramway, but that the paving setts should be 4-in. * 9-in. instead of 3 in. * 6-in. as proposed by the Company. CHALET ACCOMMODATION. A letter was received from the London County Council dated 21st May, 1889, stating that the Council had had under consideration the question of the deficiency of Chalet Accommodation for men and women throughout London, and of the very serious injury and inconvenience to the public which result from such deficiency, and that the Council was of opinion that it was most desirable that the District Boards and Vestries of the Metropolis should provide sufficient accommodation of the nature referred to in their Districts, either by the provision of chalets or by constructing places giving such accommodation below the level of the ground, in the manner which had proved successful in the City and elsewhere. The letter also expressed a hope that the Hoard would do something in its District towards providing a remedy for the inconvenience and physical injury traceable to the want of proper accommodation of the kind in question. The Council was informed in reply that for several reasons the Board did not see their way to provide chalets in this District. IMPROVEMENTS. In July 1889, as requested by the Board I brought under the notice of Mr. Leon, one of the representatives of the District at the London County Council, the question of the importance of the west end of Ben Jonson Road being widened, and also of the improvement of the Victory Bridge, in order that he might use his influence at the Council to ensure such improvements receiving attention. Subsequently the following resolution was passed, and a communication in similar terms was addressed to the London County Council:—" That thin Board, in consideration of the great inconvenience caused to the inhabitants of this District by the present condition of Victory Bridge, as well as the narrowness of Ben Jonson Road at the Stepney Green end, desires to press upon the County Council the absolute necessity of at once giving the matter their attention." On the 14th November, a Deputation appointed by the Board waited upon a Committee of the Vestry of Mile End Old Town, and urged the importance of the improvement of Ben Jonson Road and Victory Bridge, and the Committee recommended the Vestry to join with this Board in presenting a memorial to the County Council praying that the improvement might be carried out by the Council as a county improvement In December 1889, in accordance with a request by the Board, I prepared and laid before the works Committee plans shewing proposed Improvements in the District as follows :— No. 1 Improvement.—Commercial Road, Limehouse, opposite the Town Hall and Limehouse Churchyard. This improvement involved the setting back of the fronts of 11 premises, and widening the bridge on the north side over the Limehouse Cut. The frontage was 103 yards, and the existing frontages would have been set back to a depth of 25-ft. 6-in. in the centra running of t nothing at the east and west ends, increasing the width of the road in the centre from 44-ft. 6 in. to 70 ft. No. 2 Improvement.—Commercial Road, Ratcliff, at the east corner of White Horse Street. This improvement involved the setting back of the fronts of 10 premises extending from White Horse Street to the west side of Messrs. Burdett's premises, No. 625, Commercial Road. The frontage was 57 yards and the existing frontages would have been set back to a depth at the east end of 6-ft., and in White Horse Street at the west end of 7-ft. 6-in, making the footpaths 12-ft. 10-in., and 13-ft. 6-in. respectively. No. 3 Improvement—New Gravel Lane and Wapping Wall, Shad well. The improvement in Now Gravel Lane on the west side from King Street southward to a point opposite Waging Wall, involved the setting hark of the fronts of 17 premises. The frontage was 86 yards, and the existing frontages would have been set back to a depth of 14-ft., increasing the width of the roadway from 20-ft. 6-in. to 35-ft. The improvement at the west end of Wapping Wall on the north side involved the setting hark of the fronts of 10 premises. The frontage was 56 yards, and the existing frontages would have been sot back to a depth of 11-ft , increasing the width of the roadway from 20-ft to 31-ft. The improvement at the east end of Wapping Wall, from Star Street to the south end of the swing bridge over the old entrance to the London Docks, involved the purchase of a Pprtion of the premises called Wagner's Place and Cooperage, and also of 10 premises fronting the north side of Wapping Wall. The width of the proposed road was 30 ft., and the length 110 yard*. No. 4 Improvement.—Broad Street, Ratcliff. This improvement involved the setting back of the fronts of 16 premises extending on the north side of Broad Street, from School house Lane to a point opposite Hubbuck's Wharf. The frontage was 108 yards, and the existing frontages would have been set back to a depth of 10-lt. 6-in. at the east end, and 6 ft. at the west end, increasing the roadway to an uniform width of 40 ft. No. 5 Improvement.- Three Colt Street, Limehouse. The improvement from Narrow Street to a point opposite the west end of New Street, involved the setting back of the fronts of 6 premise*. 1 he frontage was 43 yards,and the existing frontages would have been pet back to an average depth of 10-ft, increasing the width of the road from 16-ft. to 32-ft. The improvement from a point north of Ropemaker's Fields to opposite Gun Lane, involved the sotting bark of the fronts of 8 premises. The frontage was 40 yards, and the existing frontages would have been set back to a depth of 10-ft. 6 in. at the south end running off to nothing at the north end, increasing the width of the roadway at the south end from 19-ft. to 29- ft. 6-in. The Board resolved with regard to Improvements Nos. 1,3, 4, and 5, that the County Council be requested to carry out the same as county improvements. No.notion was taken with regard to Improvement No. 2. In February 1890, a letter was received from the County Council as to the proposed Three Colt Street Improvement (No. 5) stating that it had occurred to the Improvements Committee of the Council that any additional accommodation which might Iks required between the Commercial Road and Emmett Street, Poplar, could better be provided by the construction of a new thoroughfare between the West India Dock Road and Bridge Road, and asking the opinion of the Board upon the point. The matter is under consideration. In February last the County Council informed the Board that their Improvements Committee had made a report upon the subject of the proposed widening of Broad Street, Ratcliff, (Improvement No. 4) and the Council were of opinion that the suggested widening could not be regarded as a Metropolitan Improvement, and were not prepared to accede to the request of the Board. In May 1889, I reminded the Board that many years previously I had projected a plan for the improvement of Wapping Wall, and suggested that, between Star Street and the bridge over the old entrance to the London Dock, a new road should be constructed so an to avoid interfering with several large warehouses which had been erected on the north side of Wapping Wall, and I submitted a plan shewing the proposed widening and improvement of Wapping Wall, and the situation of the new street. The London Hydraulic Power Company having purchased from the representatives of tinlate Mr. Wagner, the houses in Wagner Place and the Cooperage in the rear, and other property on the north side thereof for the purpose of clearing the ground, and erecting a station for supplying the necessary power for charging the mains which they proposed to lay in the District, the Works Committee made an inspection of the locality, and as directed by the Board I opened negotiations with the Company as to the terms upon which they would be willing to give up so much of the land in question as would be required for the eastern portion of the proposed improvement. The owner of gun Dock having determined to erect a warehouse upon the site of the Dock, as the old frontage projected into the street I was requested to negociate for the purchase of the piece of land which would remain in front of the warehouse, when the same was built. I accordingly had several interviews with the owner, who ultimately agreed to sell the land to the Board, for the purpose of widening the street, for the sum of £300. Application was made to the London County Council for a contribution of one moiety of the cost, which was acceded to. The conveyance has been executed, and the ground has been paved and thrown into the street, and the County Council has paid the agreed contribution. In October 1889, the attention of the Board was directed to the decision of the London County Council to take steps to obtain power to carry out certain improvements in the Strand and its neighbourhood, the cost of which was estimated at from £1,000,000 to £2,250,000, and the Board passed the following resolution "That the representatives of the Division bee earnestly requested to use their utmost influence to prevent the carrying out the Strand scheme, until attention has been paid to the many pressing wants of this District and neighbourhood," In consequence of the death of the late Clerk of the Board, Mr. Thomas Wrake Ratcliff. the Board appointedd me Clerk pro tem. I performed the duties of the office until the appointment of Mr. Sidney George Ratcliff, to the vacant office I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Hoard. 8413 BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the year 18891 TO THE BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District during the year 1889. At a distance of eight years from the last census it is difficult to estimate with any near approach to accuracy the population of this District, subject as it is to influences which do not affect places of regular and progressive growth. Limehouse has probably increased in population since the last census by some hundreds, for it is only on that side of your District that it is capable of expansion, but Ratcliff, Shadwell, and Wapping, have I suspect decreased in imputation, owing to the demolition of houses under the Artisans' and Lalnmrers' Dwellings Act, 1875, in Brook Street, Ratcliff, and Angel Gardens, Shadwell, and by the London Riverside Fish Market Company, in Lower Shadwell. For the purposes of this Report I estimate the population of your District as 60,000. The Births registered during the year, numbered 2,109, of which, 1,186 belonged to Limehouse, 481 to Ratcliff, and 442 to Shadwell and Wapping. These figures indicate a birth rate in the District of 35 per 1,000 population, a number somewhat below the ten years' average. The birth rate of London was 30.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. 2 The marriages registered during the year, numbered 411, giving a proportion of 13.7 persons married, to 1,000 of the population. The annual average number of marriages for the last ten years was 451, which corresponds to a marriage rate of 15 persons per 1,000. The marriage rate in London for the year, was 16.3 persons per 1,000. The registered Deaths, exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the District, but inclusive of those of residents which occurred in Public Institutions beyond the limits of the District numbered 1,303 and corresponded to a death rate of 22.7 per 1,000 population, that of London being 17.4 per 1,000, the lowest death rate as yet recorded, and of the Eastern Districts 19.6. As regards the Death rate in your District, it is 2.2 per thousand below the average of the last ten years. I am required by the Local Government Board to make a return of Mortality and Sickness in the District on forms provided by them. These forms are marked A and B, and appear among the other tables. Table A sets forth the deaths of the whole of those regi-tered as having actually occurred in the several localities comprised within the District; the East London Children's Hospital being regarded for the purposes of tlie«e statistics as a separate locality. The Deaths at all ages so divided and distributed are as follows : Limehouse 539 Ratcliff 282 Shadwell and Wapping 190 East London Children's Hospital 245 1,256 Deaths in Public Institutions outside the District, but belonging thereto 287 1,543 Deduct 180 for Deaths in East London Children's Hospital of persons not belonging to District 180 Corrected Mortality 1,363 3 Table B sets forth the new cases of sickness which have come to my knowledge during the year, together with the sources of such information. These are returns made to me by the Poor Law Medical Officer, the Resident Medical Officer of the East London Children's Hospital, the Medical Officer of the Tower Hamlets Dispensary, and Private Practitioners; such returns and notifications have Wen distributed among the Parishes of the District in which they occurred, and consequently the East London Children's Hospital docs not appear in table B as a separate locality; of the 1,363 Deaths, 336 were those of children under one year, and 246 those of children over one and under five years. The Deaths of children under five years therefore, amounted to 582, a number which corresponds to a rate of 42.7 per cent of the total deaths. The average annual rate of such Deaths for the last ten years was 44.9 per cent The Deaths in Public Institutions within and without tho District of persona ordinarily resident therein were 352. The Deaths from the principal Zymotic diseases numbered 173 and correspond to death rate of 2.9 per 1,000 population. Such diseases are Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhus, Enteric or Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Diarrhœa. Small Pox.—No death was registered from this disease in the District during the year. Measles.—The corrected number of deaths was 19, of which 15 occurred in Limehouse. The ages at death, in all cases, were below five years. The Annual death rate was .33 per 1000, that of Loudon being 53 per 1,000, The Annual average number of deaths for the last ten years was 50. Forty-one cases came to my knowledge, viz., 21 in Limehouse, 7 in Ratcliff, and 13 in Shadwell and Wapping. As this is not a disease the notification of which is compulsory in your district, the returns of sickness are of course imperfect, a statement which applies in 4 some degree to the other diseases of this class, seeing that the Notification Act came into force in London only on the 31st October, 1889. Scarlatina.—The corrected number of deaths, was 27 which corresponds to a death rate of .45 per 1,000. The average number of deaths for the last ten yearn, was 53. One hundred and fifty-nine cases came to my knowledge during the year, of which 92 occurred in Limehouse, 27 in Ratcliff, and 40 in Shadwell and Wapping. The disease appeared with most frequency in that part of your district known as Limehouse Fields, which locality has consequently received a considerable amount of attention by your Sanitary Staff". Diphtheria.—The corrected number of deaths was 41 which indicates a death rate of .68 per 1,000. The average annual number of deaths. for the last ten years, was 11. The mortality from this disease is increasing rapidly, not only in your District, but also in the Metropolis In 1886 the deaths in the District were 7; in 1887, 10; in 1888, 23; and in 1889, 41. In the Metropolis the deaths were in 1887, 953; in 1888, 1,311; and in 1889, 1,588. Ninety-five cases came to my knowledge, of which 27 occurred in Limehouse, 26 in Ratcliff and 42 in Shadwell and Wapping; of these Peabody Buildings contributed 9, and Juniper Street 7, both places being buildings of the artisan dwelling type. WHOOPING COUGH.—The deaths from this disease numbered 23 and correspond to a death rate of .38 per 1,000. The anuual average number of deaths for the last ten years was 57. TYPHUS.—One death was ascribed to this disease. Enteric Fever.—The corrected number of deaths was 13 corresponding to a rate of .21 per 1,000. The annual average number of deaths for the last ten years was 11. Forty-one cases came to my knowledge, of which 26 occurred in Limehouse, 8 in Ratcliff, and 7 in Shadwell and Wapping; again the attention of your sanitary staff was directed to Limehouse Fields, for of the 26 eases which occurred in Limehouse, 5 occured in the Fields. 5 Simple Continued Fever.—One death was registered from this disease. Diarrhœa.—The corrected mortality was 47 ; corresponding to a rate of .78 per 1,000. The annual average number of deaths for the last ten years was 51. Six hundred and eighty two cases were reported, of which 115 occured in Limehouse, 264 in Ratcliff, and 303 in Shadwell and Wapping. The majority of these casos were derived from a return made by the Medical Officer of the Fast London Childrens' Hospital, which is situated in the Parish of Shadwell. Constitutional Diseases caused 225 deaths and included 10 from Pickets, 32 from Cancer, 24 from Tabes Mesenterica, 22 from Tubercular Meningitis, 114 from Phthisis, and 10 from Scrofula. The deaths from Cancer still increase; in 1887 they were 22; in 1888, 29, and in 1889, 32; in the five years, 1877 to 1881, the average yearly number was only 13. Developmental Diseases caused 77 deaths, and included 20 from Premature Birth, and 57 from old age. Local Diseases caused 714 deaths, and included 152 from diseases of the Nervous System, 89 from diseases of the Circulatory System, 350 from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, 71 from diseases of the Organs of Digestion, and 30 from Diseases of the Urinary System. Eighty-one deaths were due to Violence, of which number 73 were the result of accident or negligence. Sixty-two deaths were registered from Debility, Sanitary Work.—For the details of the routine Sanitary work carried out by the Inspectors, I beg to refer you to Table VI. The Inspectors' duties have increased considerably during tho last few years, a circumstance which I regard as the 6 outcome of the attention which has been directed of late to sanitary matters, and more especially to the condition of the homes of the working classes. The legislation of recent years has also imposed new and important duties upon you, while your means of executing them hare remained stationary. Under these circumstances an increase in your inspectorial staff will doubtless commend itself to your consideration. As regards the principal localities and premises which have come under my notice during the year, I beg to report as follows:— Early in January I had occasion to report upon the condition of May's Cottages, Limehouse Fields. This place has been frequently under observation. On the occasion in question, I reported that the sanitary condition of the houses was very defective, and the court required paving. Your Board passed a resolution to the effect that notices be served upon the owner of the property to remedy the defects, and that the Surveyor be requested to inspect the Court, and report on the paving thereof. The owner of the property attended at a subsequent Meeting of the Board, and asked for six months in order to do the work; the Board granted three weeks, and notice Was given to the freeholder to pave the Court The defects were remedied, but on June 26th it was found necessary to obtain a Magistrate's order for the closure of No 7, and on October 23rd the place was referred to the Surveyor and myself to report upon. In the end it was decided to make an application to the Magistrate to close the houses which has been done, and they arc now undergoing a thorough repair in accordance with the specification of the Survevor On February 6th the Magistrate's order was obtained for the closure of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8, Tenbury Place, Limehouse, the houses having fallen into an unsanitary state. A similar order was obtained in April with regard to the houses in King John's Court, Limehouso. In May they were boarded up; they are to be demolished. 7 On 17th th April complaint was made to me of a nuisance arising from dust at the Regent's Canal Flock Mills, Shoulder of Mutton Alley. I inspected the premises and found that the proems carried on at this place consisted in the reduction of woollen rags to the condition of flock by steam power. An intolerable dust pervaded the place, the door and windows of which were open, thereby allowing the escape of finely divided particles into the street. A fan and shaft drew some of the dust into two wooden chambers on the first floor, which were ventilated into the open air by means of holes in the roof. The nuisance was very serious, and calculated to cause injury to the health of the inhabitants of the locality. Notice was at once served upon the owner to abate the nuisance, which was complied with, but not effectually; ultimately in July, the premises were destroyed by fire. The premises belonging to Messrs. Abbott and Fletcher, known as St Anne's Farm, in the Burdett Road, came under my inspection, in consequence of the complaint of neighbours about the smell arising from grains deposited thereon ; the nuisance was abated. Glover's Court, Rateliff. These houses had got into a bad state, but on the service of notice to put them into a proper condition, they were repaired and made habitable. Early in May a letter was received from the London County Council desiring to be informed as to any unsanitary areas within the District which should be dealt with under the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1875, I therefore made a minute inspection of the Courts and Alleys, and after due consideration, reported that there were no such areas in the district I had previously made representations to the Metropolitan Board regarding areas in Upper East Smithfield, Brook Street, Ratcliff, and Cable Street, Shadwell, all of which had been dealt with under the provisions of the aforesaid Act. At tho end of June my attention was called to Peabody's Buildings, Shadwell, in consequence of the occurrence there ot several cases of Diphtheria. Upon enquiry I found that the 8 building were frequently short of water, and that consequently the flush to the closets was at times insufficient, if not absent. The water tanks are situated at a height of over sixty feet, and though I am informed they are filled every morning, it is quite a common occurrence for the buildings to be short of water in the afternoon. The trustees were written to upon the subject, but they replied stating that the quantity of water supplied per head per diem was 10 gallons, which they considered sufficient. Thin quantity however, gives no margin for waste, and I am of opinion that at least 20 gallons should he allowed. The buildings an? on the constant supply, and it is only the height at which the tanks are placed, which limits the quantity of water. A small gas engine to propel the water into the tanks in the middle of the day would obviate the difficulty. In June began series of complaints against Messrs. Wickens, Pease & Co., Bone Boilers, of Broad Bridge, Shadwell. This place has frequently been the subject of my Report. As a rule during the winter months no complaints are made, but with the advent of summer they are very frequent On the present occasion I found a nuisance arising from the defective paving in the yard, the insufficient height of the shaft, and the general dirty condition of the premises. A notice was served, calling upon the Company to cement the yard, to raise the shaft 30 fret, and an arrangment was come to, whereby the small bones and stale material which came in every day should be put into the coppers at once and boiled, and directions were given to keep the place cleaner. All these were attended to, and since then I have had no complaints. The Slaughter and Cow Houses were duly inspected and reported upon. No opposition was made to the renewal of any licence. For a list of these premises, I beg to refer you to Table IX. The Bakehouses were also inspected once in the Spring, and again in the Autumn, and notices were served to remedy defects. A list of these places will be found at tho end of the Report. 9 The Notification of Diseases Act came into force on 31st October; previous to that date steps were taken to inform the public concerning their new responsibilities. The medical men residing or practising in the District were addressed individually by circular letter, sotting forth the principal provisions of the Act, and a Book of Forms of Certificates was sent to each. At the end of the year 117 notifications had been received, of which 67 referred to Scarlntina, 13 to Diphtheria, 13 to Entoric Fever, 11 to Erysipelas, and the remainder to continued fever, membranous croup, measles, and typhus Of these 31 were removed to Hospital; viz., 20 cases of Scarlatina, 7 of Diphtheria, 2 of Enteric Fever, 1 of Erysipelas, and 1 of Continued Fever. The duties devolving on your Sanitary Staff in carrying out the provisions of thin Act are both numerous and responsible. My duties under the Canal Boats Act have not been very onerous, the only boats I have been called upon to examine during the year, bing the Providence, the Richard, and the Dart, all belonging to Mr. Win. Iszard, of Lea Bridge, and the Champion belonging to Messrs. W. C. Barnes & Co. The duties devolving upon the Inspector under the Act have occupied a considerable portion of bin time. In November in consequence of a complaint having been made about the accommodation provided for post mortem examinations at the Wapping Mortuary it was resolved that it and the Ratcliff Mortuary be inspected by the Works Committee. This inspection was made, and though I have reason to believe that neither the premise- nor the facilities for performing post mortem examinations commended themselves to the Committee they made no recommendation to the Board. The existing building- and arrangements are far from satisfactory, and 10 I would suggest to the Board the propriety of considering the powers conferred upon them in this direction by the 27th and 28th Sections of the Sanitary Act, 1866. In November also, Ann's How, Chusan Place, Gloucester Court, and Ann's Place, came under my notice. These places were all found to be in an unsanitary Mate, and on my reporting to you to that effect, it was resolved to apply to the magistate for an order to close them as being unfit for human habitation. The order was applied for and obtained. On the 18th December I made a Report to the Board regarding 55, 57, and 61, Brook Street, Ratcliff, under the Pro visions of the Artisans' and labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868 (Torrens' Act). My Report was referred to the Surveyor in accordance with the Provisions of the said Act. Queen Catherine Court, Black Bull Alley, Grove Court, and certain houses in London Street, were also reported by me as being unfit for habitation, and were referred to the Surveyor. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. One hundred and one samples of Food were examined at the Laboratory during the year, viz., 31 of Milk, of which samples were adulterated with water in the proportions of 13, 14, 15, 21, and 29 per cent. The seller of the Milk adulterated with 13 per cent. of water elected to have a portion of the sample sent to Somerset House, where the Analysis was confirmed. He was fined 10/- and costs, and had to pay the costs of the second analysis. the seller of the Milk adulterated with 14 per cent, of water, pleaded the 25th sec. of the Act, and the summons was dismissed the sellers of the others were fined respectively 10/- , 20/-, and 10 with costs in each case. Thirteen samples of butter were examined, of which one consisted entirely of Margarine; the seller was fined 10/- and costs. Seven samples of Pepper were examined, of which one was found to be adulterated with grounl Rice. Nine samples of Mustard were examined, of which one was found to be adulterated 11 with wheat flour, and coloured with turmeric Fourteen samples of Bread were examined; they were all genuine. One sample of Cocoa was examined ; it was found to consist of 25 per cent. of Cocoa, the rest was arrowroot and sugar. Seven samples of Flour were examined, they were all genuine. Two samples of Beer, and two of Whisky were examined, and were found to be genuine. The Inspectors (one of whom has to my great sorrow been removed by death) performed their duties in their usual painstaking, intelligent mauner, and to my entire satisfaction.
