On the 12th of June last, the Board by a unanimous vote, elected W. H. Lammin, Esq., to be the representative of this District at the Metropolitan Board of Works, and at the same time a cordial vote of thanks was given to Mr. Lammin for his previous services. LOANS. The Board during-the year ending 25th March, 1879, obtained the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works to a loan to defray the cost of the alterations of Offices at Broadway House, and the erection of a new Board Room. WEST KENSINGTON STATION, NORTH END ROAD. The widening and improvement of this thoroughfare has been continued from a point opposite the West Kensington Station, in front of the Baron's Court Estate as far as Gibb's Green, by ' J setting back the line of the new buildings, and the fences of the forecourts of some of the old buildings. This was mainly carried out by the land owner, who, however, was unable to come to terms with the owners or Leaseholders of three of the houses, and the Board, in order to complete the work has ordered notices to be served upon the said owners under the provisions of the Act 57 Geo. 3 c. 195, and it is hoped that under that statute the Board will be able to acquire at a moderate cost the three plots necessary to complete the improvements. OPEN SPACE-WORMWOOD SCRUBBS. The Board is glad to be able to state that a Bill has been introduced into Parliament for dealing with this Common in the manner indicated in ths last Annual Report. EEL BROOK—BROOK GREEN—PARSONS GREEN. The result of the enquiry before the Assistant Enclosure Commissioners has not yet been published, but the Board is informed that negotiations are now pending between the Metropolitan 15 Board of Works, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, as Lords of the Manor, and others, for the acquisition of these Commons by the Metropolitan Board for the use of the public. THAMES RIVER (PREVENTION OF FLOODS) BILL. The Board regrets to have to report that notwithstanding the decision of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1877, as fully reported in last year's proceedings, the Metropolitan Board of Works has, for the third time, introduced a bill into Parliament, by which it is proposed to cast the responsibility and cost of works necessary for the Prevention of Floods, within the Metropolis, upon the Vestries and District Boards, in respect of public docks, roads, and ways, and upon riparian owners, and occupiers in other cases, proposing thus to make a new liability upon Riverside Authorities, owner, or occupiers, in direct contravention of the Common Law as laid down in Hudson v. Tabor. For the due protection of the interest of this District, the Board is again obliged to enter into an expensive contest with the Metropolitan Board, the necessary Petition has been deposited, and in due course the Board will appear by Counsel thereon. Petitions from this District against the Bill have also been presented by the Board of Guardians of the Fulham Union, the Vestry of Fulham, the Vestry of Hammersmith, and also petitions from two public meetings of the Ratepayers. The Board hope that the result will be such as to relieve the District from a burden of unknown magnitude, which the provisions of the Bill, as at present drawn, would entail. The Board desires to record its thanks to the Borough Members for the ready and valuable help they have at all times given in opposing the Bills. THE MALL (OBSTRUCTIONS). In the matter of the occupation of certain land in front of East Cottage by Mr. William Ayres as a wharf, and the action brought by Mr. William Ayres against the Board, to try the question whether that portion of the Mall, opposite Mr. Ayres' cottage, was or was not a public way, the Solicitor-General, Mr. Talfourd Salter, Q C., and Mr. Shiress Will, appeared for the Board, and Mr. Herschell, Q.C., and Mr. Reed for Mr. Ay res. After a long trial, which lasted two days, a verdict was given for the Plaintiff. The Solicitor-General subsequently 16 obtained a Rule Nisi for a new trial on the ground of misdirection by Lord Coleridge in his summing up to the jury. That rule was afterwards argued in the Court of Exchequer, and discharged. On appeal that decision was affirmed, one Judge of the Appeal Court being in favour of a new trial being granted, but the other two Judges thinking it unnecessary on the ground that though there had been a mis-direction by Lord Coleridge, yet that mis-direction had probably not affected the decision of the jury. It is with much regret that the Board has thus to report that it has failed to retain for the use of the public the right of free access to and from the river at this point—a right which has been enjoyed by the public for very many years. TOLL BRIDGES, The Metropolitan Board of Works are now negotiating with the proprietors for the purchase of Hammersmith Bridge, Putnev Bridge and Wandsworth Bridge, with a view to the said bridges being declared free for the use of the public under the provisions of the Toll Bridge Act, 1877. STREET NOMENCLATURE. Norfolk Terrace, Westwick street, has been named Westwick Gardens, and the houses re-numbered. Bridge street, Fulham, has been incorporated with High Street, and the houses re-numbered. Britannia Road, Fulham, the houses renumbered. Aldine Street, Shepherd's Bush, the houses re-numbered. St. Stephens Road. Shepherd's Bush, has been renamed, St. Stephen's Avenue, and the houses re-numbered. PILLAR LETTER BOXES. At the request of the Post Office Authorities the Board has sanctioned one removal from Dalling Road, corner of Andover Road, to the corner of Wingate Road, One new one erected at the corner of Auriol Road. THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS V. THIS BOARD. BLOMFIELD ROAD SEWER. In this case the Metropolitan Board applied for a Mandamus to Compel this Board to take up and relay the sewer in Blomffeld Road. Mr. Herschell, Q.C. and Mr. Pethcram appeared for this Board, and Mr. Philbrick, Q.C. and a Junior for the Metropolitan Board. The Queens Bench Division directed the 17 Writ of Mandamus to issue, and this Board decided not to continue the litigation but to execute the required works, PRECEPT ACCOUNTS. In order to facilitate the making and collecting of the local management rates the Board, after correspondence with the Parish Officers of Fulham and Hammersmith, has arranged that in future the Parish Officers will close the Rates for the year, and render an account of the same at or about the 25th of March in each year, so as to enable the Board to issue precepts for the various sums required for the ensuing twelve months as soon after that date as possible. CONSTRUCTION OF REFUGES. Since the completion of the railway works the whole of the surface of the Broadway has been regulated and reformed to the altered levels, and additional refuge for pedestrians has been constructed at the entrance to the Station Road. The other refuges in the Broadway have been reconstructed and ornamental gas pillars erected at each of the three refuges, the Board has also constructed a refuse of like character next to the “Thatched House" in the Dalling Road. STOPPING UP HIGHWAYS. During the year the Board received notice from the Gas Light and Coke Company, that they were desirous of stopping up a certain portion of Sands End Lane in the Parish of Fulham and that they were willing to construct and dedicate to the use of the public a new highway to be lormed on land belonging to the Company between Sands End Lane and Bagleys Lane and running from the Kings Road in a straight line to the river Thames. Notice was also received from Messrs. Gibbs and Flew of their desire to stop up a certain portion of Goaters Alley in the same parish and to construct and dedicate to the public a certain new highway to be called Sherbroke Road and leading from Rylston Road to Dawes Lane. These applications in due course went before the Fulham Vestry and subsequently were submitted to thejustices and the necessary orders were obtained. Goaters Alley has been stopped as applied for and the new road is open but in the case of the Gas Company the new high way is not yet completed, and Sands End Lane remains open. C 18 BROADWAY HOUSE. To meet the increase of work consequent upon the rapid development of the District, the Board found it necessary to provide additional office accommodation, feeling that it might be more desirable to erect new premises, Advertisements were issued inviting offers of freehold land in the neighbourhood of the Broadway, and several sites were offered. Negotiations were entered into, but the prices asked by the various owners were so large that the Board was unable to secure an eligible site. It was then resolved that alterations and additions be made, and a new Board room erected at the rear of Broadway House, which premises the Board hold for an unexpired term of 58 years, at the low rental of £50 per annum. Plans were accordingly prepared by the Board's Surveyor, and a contract entered into for carrying out the works, which are now in progress. The amount required to defray the costs of the work has been raised by a loan from the Atlas Insurance Company at 4¼ per cent., the repayment of the principal sum being spread over a period of twenty years. CARTAGE, ETC. In August last the Board appointed a Committee of the whole Board to prepare a scheme for carrying on cartage, slopping, watering, &c., for the whole District, and report to the Board, or to take such other steps as might be deemed advisable. A Sub-committee, consisting of nine members, was then appointed, which Sub-committee, after making inquiries of the Vestries and District Boards where the contract system had been abandoned, personally visited and inspected the various depots at Paddington, Islington, Newington, Camberwell and Kensington, and after an exhaustive enquiry presented a report detailing the result of their enquiries, and reccommending the Board to take the necessary steps to introduce the plan as adopted by the above-mentioned Parishes, with such modifications as may be desirable meet to the requirements of the District, and also recommending the purchase of certain land at the rear of No. 7, in the Broadway, and accompanied their report with detailed estimates (two) of the probable amount required to be expended in establishing the system in this District. This report was presented on the 18th November and adopted, the site purchased, plans have been prepared for 19 the erection of the necessary stables and other buildings, and application has been made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for a loan of £15,605, the amount required, and it is confidently believed that after providing for the repayment of this sum, the annual interest thereon, and the current expenses, that a very large annual saving will result to the District, as compared with the cost under the contract system. In addition to the above mentioned site, the Board has also acquired increased space at the Walham Green depot, by taking on lease for 58 years, at an annual rent of £105, the premises known as Trafalgar House and Trafalgar Laundry. the dividing fence has been removed, and the old house known as the laundry taken down, and the whole area thrown into one holding, upon which it is in contemplation to erect additional stabling, &c. REMOVAL OF PIGGERIES. Proceedings have been taken against a large number of persons keeping pigs, and orders have been obtained for the removal of the animals and prohibiting keeping of swine upon the premises for the future. COLLEGE PARK ESTATE. This estate, lying at the extreme northern or Dorth-eastern boundary of the District, having been acquired by Messrs. Williams, Son and Wallington, and laid out for building pur poses, the owners applied to the Board to provide an outlet for the drainage of the property (some four hundred houses). The Board, after mature consideration and taking into account the probable requirements of this very large portion of the District lying to the north and north-east of the Scrubbs drew the attention of the Metropolitan Board to the fact that this land was practically without provision for drainage, and asked that Board to extend one of their main sewers to receive the sewage of the district, this Board suggesting the continuation of the main sewer from North Pole Road. The Metropolitan Board, however, has declined to extend this sewer, and the matter is still under consideration as to the line of sewer to be adopted. DISTRICt RAILWAY (FULHAM EXTENSION). The Act to authorize the construction of a Railway from West Brompton to Fulham Old Town (referred to in last year's report), having been obtained, the formation of the Railway has 20 been commenced. During the progress of the works it has been necessary for the Board to consent to the temporary stoppage of certain highways in Fulham. As the works are now being rapidly pushed forward it is hoped that the various roads may shortly be re-opened for the use of the public. WOOD PAVEMENTS. The Board being desirous of laying down wood paving in King Street East from the Broadway, past the West London Hospital, obtained a report from the Works Committee, which committee, after visiting and inspecting the wood paving works then in progress for the Kensington Vestry by the Asphalte Wood Paving Company, Messrs. Henson and Co., and Messrs. Nowell and Robson, recommended the Board to ask these various contractors to tender for the paving of King Street East from the Broadway to Rowan Road, and the Board subsequently accepted the tender of Messrs. Nowell and Robson. PARLIAMENTARY NOTICES. In accordance with the standing orders of Parliament, plans and notices were delivered at the office of the Board relating to the following:- West London Tramways, No. 1 and No. 2, Messrs. Reid Brothers. West London Tramways Mr. Walsh. West London Tramway, Mr. Fulton. Metropolitan District Tramways, West Metropolitan Tramways, West London Suburban Tramways, South Western Metropolin Tramways. Several large and influential deputations waited upon the Board to urge that no sanction should be given to the further extension of the Tramway system in the district, and praying that the Board would take steps to prevent such extension, and the Board thereupon resolved to oppose the whole of the above schemes, and in neither case was authority obtained for the construct ?n? o the Tramways.

Capstone House, Hammersmith, Man 1879. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,— In accordance with the privilege I possess, I beg to present to you my report on the health of this District during the year 1878. There is not a more difficult task than that of carrying out sanitary reform; for although every one agrees that sanitary laws should be put into force, nevertheless they are greatly objected to when they interfere with oneself. Of course, in the large majority of cases, someone is interfered with, and as a natural consequence there is always someone who fancies himself aggrieved. It is, however, satisfactory to notice that when difficulties are overcome, in by far the majority of instances, the very person who has most objected will express himself in terms of satisfaction that he was obliged to comply. -Much was accomplished last year in the way of sanitary improvement, but still there is much that requiries to be done. Time, determination and energy must eventually be productive of good. The mortality during the past year was exceptionally large; in fact the largest that has ever occurred in this district since registration was commenced. I shall be able to show you that there were ample causes to account for it, also that those causes need occasion no increased anxiety, but that the health of the district, taking all the circumstances into consideration, has improved. The birth-rate was also the largest that has ever occurred in this District, the result of its great prosperity 42 and increase of population, chiefly the result of immigration. There can be no doubt, to use the words of the Registrar General, that "London, is, as regards its magnitude, the greatest City in the world but its low rate of mortality, if we take its density into consideration, is still more striking. With a density of 29.322 persons to the square mile, the mortality should be 35.2 per thousand persons liiving per annum, were not special systems of drainage and cleanliness in use in London, by which the mortality in the years 1874.8 was reduced to 22.8, and thereby 12,178 lives are saved annually. You may fairly claim to be the means of saving a proportion of these lives, seeing, as I shall show you, that your mortality rate is less than that of the whole Metropolis. This is the last Western District of the lesser Metropolis. It comprises an area of 4,209 acres, and an estimated population of 100,000 inhabitants. It is divided for registration purposes into three sub-districts, namely:—Fulham, which is the Parish of Fulham; and St. Peter's and St. Paul's, which together make the Parish of Hammersmith. Hereinafter, for the sake of brevity, these sub-districts are spoken of as Fulham, St. Paul's and St. Peter's. Fulham comprises an area of 1,716 statute acres, St. Paul's 2,102, and St. Peter's 185. The estimated population of Fulham is 40,000 inhabitants, that of St. Peter's and St. Paul's together 60,000 inhabitants. On the 31st December last there were 15,257 inhabited houses— 10,300 in the Parish of Hammersmith, and 4,957 in the Parish of Fulham. This gives, on the estimated population, 6.5 persons to each house. There is an excellent system of drainage, and, as a natural consequence, the amount of that disease, enteric fever, which is the direct result of bad and imperfect drainage, is but small. There is an excellent water supply, both as to quantity and quality; though as to quality there is still some room for improvement. Extensive building operations of a superior kind are now being carried on in both Parishes, and to such an extent that we may fairly expect great additions to the population within a very limited period. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, namely, that this is almost the largest district in the Metropolis, that the population is rapidly increasing, that large numbers of houses of a superior class are being constantly constructed, and that the value of property is increasing every year, it is likely that this will be, at no distant period, one of the most important districts of London. Numerous must be the difficulties that your Board 43 have to contend against during the growth of this great locality. Like the human species during the active period of growth, numerous must be the dangers to be guarded against and detects to be remedied—the natural result of growth; for it is obvious that a system that might work well, or a trade, such as pig keeping, that might not be a serious nuisance with a population of 50,000 inhabitants, might totally fail, or be an intolerable nuisance, when there was 100,000 inhabitants residing in the same locality. It is this difference, that it is hard to get the public to understand. It is immediately said that more strict sanitary supervision is the result of excessive zeal on the part of some officer; but it is not perceived that the circumstances of the case are altered, and although a course adopted 10 or 15 years ago might have been all that was necessary then for the preservation of public health, nevertheless the same course might be totally inadequate in the present day. mortality and death rate. The number of deaths registered in this district last year, was 2346 (males, 1176 and females, 1170) being one death to 42.6 of the population against 1765 in the previous year, which equalled one death to 56.7. The average number of deaths registered during the last five years was 1926. This mortality includes all deaths registered in the district, If, however, we deduct the deaths of non-parishioners, that took place in the Fulham Small Pox Hospital, allowing the deaths of non-parishioners in the West London Hospital, and other Public Institutions to go for compensative allowance for the unknown deaths of parishioners which may have taken place in general Hospitals outside the district, the corrected mortality for last year would be 2261, The gross death rate therefore taking the deaths as registered (2346), was 23.46 per thousand persons living, being slightly less than the death rate of the whole metropolis, which was 23'5. The corrected mortality rate was 22.6, being, .9 less than the whole metropolis. Of the deaths registered in this district last year 138 took place in St. Peter's, 1161 in St. Paul's and 1047 in Fulham. The average number of deaths in the three sub-districts during the last five years was, St. Peters, 131, St. Pauls, 980, and Fulham, 815. There was, therefore, as compared with the average mortality during the last five years an increase of seven deaths in St. Peter's, 181 in St. Paul's, and 231 in Fulham, but if we deduct the 85 deaths of non-parishioners which took place in the Fulham Small Pox Hospital there 44 was an increase of 147 deaths in Fulham. The increase of mortality is to be explained by (1) the great increase of population, the result of natural increase and immigration; (2)the very low mortality in 1877, owing chiefly to the high temperature during its last three months, a large number of delicate and aged persons having been spared who would have inevitably died duringan ordinary cold and damp season, and (3)the exceptionally hot summer and very prolonged period of cold and damp weather during the end of last year. Extremes of temperature are mostly productive of increased mortality, and more particularly so when accompanied by sudden changes. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 648, of which 30 occurred in St. Peters, 335 in St. Pauls and 283 in Fulham, against 34, in St. Peters, 218, in St. Pauls, and 229 in Fulham, during the previous year. The deaths under one year of age, were equal to 27.6 per cent of the total deaths registered and 7.9 percent, of the total registered births. The per centage of deaths under one year of agein the whole metropolis was 24.4 to the total deaths registered, and 16.3 to the total registered births. In the three sub-districts the percentage of deaths under one year of age to the total deaths and total births respectively was St. Peters 21.7 and 13.5, St. Pauls, 28.8 and 17.1 ; Fulham 27.0 and 19.7; the per centage of these deaths therefore in St. Peters was under that of the Metropolis, but in St. Pauls and Fulham above. The number of deaths at 6O years of age and upwards was 446, of which there were 38 in St. Peters, 230 in St. Pauls, and 178 in Fulham. Against 38 in St. Peters, 108 in St. Pauls, and 178 in Fulham the previous year. These deaths were equal to 19 per cent, of the total deaths, while the per centage in the whole Metropolis was equal to 20.3 per cent on the whole mortality. This per centage being lower than the Metropolitan is not in our favour, as a high per centage of mortality at 60 years of age, and upwards, as compared with the total deaths, is a favourable sign. The infantile mortality was large last year, and it is an admitted fact that by the infantile mortality we are able to judge in a great measure as to the health of a district. Still so many are the circumstances that have to be taken into consideration in judging of the health of a locality that it would not be correct to pronounce an unfavourable opinion owing to such a fact alone. On our estimated population we have only 23.7 persons to an acre, while there is an average of 47.5 to the whole Metropolis; still so large a proportion of this district is as yet almost totally uncovered that the inhabited portions are very 45 thickly populated. The density of a population exerts a most important influence on the mortality rate. Since therefore the density of the population is great in the inhabited portions of this district there exists an absolute necessity for the most careful stingent and systematic supervision. TABLE I.

The average mortality during the last two years was 21.4 per thousand persons living, and one death to 49.6 persons, as compared with a death rate of 21.8, and one death to 45 persons living in 1871, when the last census was taken. When we take into consideration that the density of the population has increased from 16 persons per acre to 23.7, this diminution in mortality is remarkable, and is a direct proof that the numerous sanitary improvements carried out by your Board have had a most important influence in improving the health of your District.

But it was only lowest as compared with the other quarters; for if we compare it with the same quarter in previous mild winters we find that the death rate during the same period last year was very materially increased. The deaths of males exceeded those of females by 6. If we turn to the birth rate, we find that the number of females born exceeded the males by 20. In the whole Metropolis, the numbers of births and deaths of males exceeded those of females. births and birth rate. The number of births registered in this District last year was remarkably large, being 3610, 179.3 males, and 1815 females. It is interesting to note that the females preponderant in this District, both as to the greater number of births, and the lesser number of deaths, while in the Metropolis the males borexceed the females, there being 105 males to every 100 females, though the number of deaths of males also exceeds that of females. These facts account in some extent for the great excess of single women. Of the births registered last vear, there were 222 in St. Peters, 100 males and 122 females, 1952 in St. Paul's, 964 males, and 988 females; 1436 in Fulham, 731 males, and 705 females. Thus we see that in the Parish of Hammersmith there was an excess of 46 females; while in Fulham there was an excess of 26 males, the per centage of males and females in Fulham being about the normal amount. The birth rate in the whole District was 36.1 per 1000 persons living —one birth to 27.7 persons. The rate in the whole Metropolis was 36.2 per 1,000 persons living. The births exceeded the deaths in this district last year by 1,264, and exceeded the number of 47 births the previous year by 201. Thus, estimating that the population has increased 4,000 in the year, 1,264 was due to excess of births, and 2,736 to immigration. TABLE III.

Of the so-called zymotic diseases 572 deaths were registered; but of these 85 were of non-parishioners, and were brought into the Fulham Small pox Hospital by the Metropolitan Asylum Board, for the purpose of isolation. The corrected number therefore of deaths of parishioners from zymotic diseases was 487. Of these 16 were registered in St. Peters, 227 in St. Panls, and 244 in Fulham. Here I may mention that these numbers do not correctly represent the proportion of those deaths in the three subdistricts, owing to the fact that nearly all the cases of small pox which occurred in Hammersmith were removed to Fulham for the pu rpose of isolation. Of course the deaths that occurred were registered in the Parish of Fulham. Of the 487 deaths from zymotic diseases there were 54 of small pox, 27 of measles, 95 of scarlet fever,???21 of diptheria, 109 of whooping cough, 3 registered as typhus, 25 of enteric fever, 7 of simple continued fever, 140 of diarrhoea, and 6 of English cholera. small pox epidemic. The epidemic of small pox, which visited London in 1876, has, with slight intermissions, continued over all the Metropolis since that period. It is an interesting fact that independently of the measures adopted by all the Vestries and District 48 Boards of this large City, the disease has continued in a greater or less degree in every district. We can come to no other conclusion than that the present means adopted are not sufficient to stamp out this frightful plague. Anyone who is at all familiar with the subject can have no difficulty in discovering the cause We know what ought to be done, and what would effectually stop the spread of this disease; but, owing to the defective legislation on the subject, our hands are tied. Even when we have used the greatest possible energy and determination, we over and over again observe the disease making its victims. It seems rather extraordinary that less power should be given to us who have to protect the lives of men, than is allotted to those who have to protect the lives of cattle; and yet no one doubts that if the same prompt measures were adopted in dealing with infectious disease in the human subject as are carried out in the case of analogous diseases in the lower animals, it would be as easy to stamp out the one as the other. Of course I do not refer to the pole-axe, but I can see no reason why the same system of immediate and compulsory isolation should not be adopted in the case of man as in that of animals. For instance, under the present stute of the law, if you have a horse suffering from glanders, &c., you do not at once report the case to the proper authorities, you will be visited with a severe fine or imprisonment; but on the other hand, you mav have a person in your charge suffering from small pox, and you may, if you like, never report the case. You may afterwards see coffin after coffin taken out of your own or your neighbour's house, and through not properly isolating the patient, cause the disease to spread to 100 persons; but there is no law to punish you (provided you have not posed the patient in a public thoroughfare), or to warn others that this must not occur again. Anyone, whose painful duty it has been to visit persons suffering from this awful scourge, must have shuddered with horror at the sights that have met his eyes. The public, who do not see this disease, can have no idea of the magnitude of the affliction it occasions to some of those affected. Let me give one case out of many. I once went into a house in Dawes' Lane, where I heard that some cases of small pox were tried to be concealed. The parents were out; so I asked if anyone was there, when two living masses of corruption raised themselves from off a heap of rags on the floor. It was impossible to discern that they were human beings: they appeared mere masses of blood and corruption. This is a dark picture, but I 49 shall be able to show you that although we cannot accomplish all we would wish for our fellow-creatures, nevertheless the course adopted by your Board has been productive of enormous good, and has saved an incalculable amount of suffering and affliction to those whose lives it is your duty to protect. It would be simply awful to realize what would be the result, if the measures now adopted were to be relinquished. We know that 50 years ago one-half of the population were scarred by this disease. During last year 266 cases of small pox were known to have occurred in this district, against 328 cases the previous year. Of the 266 cases last year, there were 173 in the parish of Fulham, against 209 the previous year, and 93 in the parish of Hammersmith, against 119 the previous year. This diminution in the number of cases is satisfactory, and points to improvement in the means employed in dealing with the disease. Of the 173 cases occurring in Fulham, 135 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated; 38 were treated at home, and not properly isolated. Of the 93 in the parish of Hammersmith, 84 were removed to hospitals and properly isolated, while 9 were treated at home, and not properly isolated. Thus, of the cases in Fulham, 28.1 per cent, were not properly isolated, whereas only 9.6 per cent, of those in Hammersmith were not properly isolated. These facts, to my mind, speak volumes. May we not reasonably ask the question—' Is not the difference in the per-centage of cases not properly isolated sufficient, and more than sufficient, to account for the difference in the actual number of cases occurring in the two parishes?' By reference to my report last year, it will be seen that 54.1 per cent, of the cases in Fulham were not properly isolated, and in Hammersmith, 16 per cent. Now, we see we have reduced the figures to 28.1 and 9.6 per cent., and what is the result? Why, we have reduced the actual numbers of cases occurring from 209 to 173, and 119 to 93. This is some evidence when we take into consideration the fact that in the Western Districts of the Metropolis last year there was a greater number of cases than the previous year. Of course, I do not pretend that this absolutely proves that the number of cases has been lessened through this cause, though the evidence is strong that points that way. Of the 266 cases of small pox occurring last year, 164 were males, and 102 females. The ages varied from 5 weeks to 70 years; the average age was 25 years: 208 E 50 of the patients bad been once vaccinated; 15 not vaccinated. In the remaining 33 cases no information as to vaccination was obtained: 219 cases were properly isolated by removal to small pox hospitals—25 to Highgate, and 104 to Fulham. Of the patients removed to hospitals, 19.5 percent, died: of those treated at home, 34 per cent., but this last does not represent the true per-centage of deaths, as there can be no doubt that there are a certain number of cases which are treated at home, and not reported at all. It is most satisfactory to be able to state that, out of all the cases which were immediately reported and removed, in only two instances did a second case of Small Pox afterwards occur in the same house, while in almost every instance where a case was not removed, fresh cases afterwards took place. On the whole, the work clone in the Sanitary Department so far as infectious disease is concerned, has been satisfactory. Great improvement has taken place, both as to the per centage of cases. removed, and as to the celerity with which they were removed. I need hardly remind you that a great deal depends upon the cordial co-operation of the medical men in the District. As regards the medical men in Hammersmith, without exception, I have to thank them for their assistance in carrying out my views. In Fulham, however, I am sorry to say I cannot make so absolute a statement, though as compared with the previous year, there was a very marked and favourable difference. I found Medical men, who, the year before, rather opposed the removal of cases most anxious to assist me. I feel sure that if all the medical men had taken the same interest as did Drs. Daniell, and Murdock, the number of cases might have been reduced 90 per cent. It is, however, gratifying to find that the public in general, appreciate the course adopted by your Board for their protection. Under the present state of law, I can suggest no improvement in this direction, unless it be systematic re-vaccination whereever a case of Small Pox has occurred. At the commencement of the year your Board, not being satisfied with the accommodation afforded by the Highgate SmallPox Hospital, owingto the inconvenience of removing cases to so great a distance, applied to the Metropolitan Asylum Board for permission to send patients to the Fulham Hospital. After considerable difficulty, this permission was obtained. Owing to the cordial co-operation of the Board of Guardians, an arrangement was entered into by which your Board refund to the Board of Guardians the expense incurred for the 51 nance of cases removed by your orders. Owing to this new arrangement, no less a sum than £438 was directly saved dining the year. Besides which it must have been an incalculable advantage to the patients to be spared the long journey, to Highgate while suffering from such an exhaustive disease as variola. TABLE IV. The following table shows the number of cases of Small Pox reported in each of the Parishes, in each of the 12 months during the year 1878, also the number of cases properly isolated by removal to Hospitals, and those not properly isolated, through being treated at home.

The existence of the Fulham Small Pox Hospital has been a great anxiety to the inhabitants of Fulham, no one can doubt it has been very injurious to the immediate locality so far as pecuniary interest is concerned; but this is not the point which it is my duty to deal with in presenting to you the facts that have come before me. There is not a more difficult task than to decide whether or not the existence of a Small Pox Hospital in a locality is a means of propagating the disease. It is not 52 prising that the public in general should jump to conclusions. The fact of a Small Pox Hospital in a locality and the on' break, of the disease in the same locality is quite evidence enough to the generality of persons that the Hospital caused the disease. It is to them simply a question of cause and effect. In the first place, in judging of the probability of the disease spreading from the Hospital, we have to ask two questions, firstly, "can it spread throuh atmospheric contagion," that is, by the particles of disease being carried in the air long distances, secondly, "can it be conveyed by direct contagion, that is, by means of officials, nurses, &c." becoming infected, and so carrying it about with them. To deal with the first point, I would say it is impossible to decide absolutely; but against the idea is the whole weight of medical science and facts as yet collected. To the second question I can at once give ;t decisive answer of "yes," but only in case of negligence and those cases ought to be few and far between. As far as this district is concerned, I have been unable to obtain any evidence, that the disease has, in a single instance spread from the Hospital; also the cases that have come to my knowledge have not been more numerous in the immediate locality of the Hospital, than in any other portion of the parish. But I feel it incumbent to ask this question. Why were there 173 persons attacked in the Fulham Parish last year, and only 93 in Hammersmith? To this question must be answered what to my mind is a perfectly sufficient reply, namely, that 28.1 percent, of the cases in the Fulham Parish were left to spread the disease, and 9*1 per cent, only of those in the Parish of Hammersmith. The whole science of the Medical Profession is in favour of this answer. If it even were granted that the disease could spread by atmospheric contagion, from a well-constructed, well-isolated, wellmanaged, well-ventilated institution, what must it do in the 28.1 per cent, of badly-constructed, badly-managed, badly-isolated, and badly-ventilated priavte dwellings? In these instances no one will deny that the disease must spread. It is certainly surprising to my mind under all the circumstances of the case putting the Hospital out. of the question that there has not been a larger amount of this disease in the Parish. At the same time I am not in favour of one District being made the receptacle for all the cases of infectious disease occuring in others. To my mind it is a most wrong and detrimental proceeding to convey patients long distances when suffering from such a disease as small-pox. The most equitable 53 and advantageous course would be that the original intention of the House of Commons be carried out by each district, or each Parish being obliged to provide its own accommodation for its own infectious diseases. The first interest that ought to be considered is that of the person who is afflicted, for it is obvious that we have no right to do individual harm by removing patients long distances for the sake of the questionable advantage which may be obtained through the Hospitals being in more isolated localities. scaelet fever. A rather severe epidemic of scarlet fever prevailed in London during last year. This District was also attacked rather severely, and more particularly so during the Autumn months. During the year, 248 cases were reported, but this undobtedly represents only a small proportion of the cases which actually occurred. There were 95 deaths registered from this disease, which on the number of cases reported would give a death rate of 38.3 per cent of persons attacked, whereas the mortality, so far as I am able to judge from the cases I saw in private practice was not more than 5 percent. Many of my remarks on the means to be employed for the effectual prevention of small.pox, equally apply to this disease. The most careful, stringent, and systematic disinfection was carried out in every case reported, so consequently it may be assumed that much good was done. It may readily be perceived that any such measures can be only palliative, while the greater proportion of cases ;»re not reported or known of until after the death of the patient. Nothing short of compulsory registration and isolation could effectually cut short an epidemic of this disease. Of the 93 deaths there were 54 in the Parish of Hammersmith, and 41 in the Parish of Fulham. diptheria. Of the 21 deaths from diptheria there were 18 in the Parish of Hammersmith and three in the Parish of Fulham. None of these cases were reported till after death. Probably a large proportion were not diptheiia, for two reasons: firstly, because they nearly all occurred singly, although diptheiia is a most infectious disease; and secondly because many affections of the throat, the result of cold and damp, are frequently mistaken in practice for diptheiia. 54 WHOOPING COUGH. Of the 109 deaths from whooping cough, there were 56 in the Parish of Hammersmith and 53 in the Parish of Fulham. TYPHUS FEVER. Of the three deaths registered from typhus fever, two were found on inquiries not to be typhus, and the third was that of a non-parishioner. The patient had been removed from some other district to the Fulham Small-Pox Hospital, under the supposition that he was suffering from variola. enteric or typhoid fever. Of the 25 deaths registered from enteric fever there were 13 in the Parish of Hammersmith and 12 in the Parish of Fulham. These cases mostly occurred from untrapped drains the result of negligence, or from contaminated water, owing to the waste pipe being in direct communication with the sewer gases. It is very seldom that information is obtained of these cases, except through the death returns. Where death had taken place, immediate sanitary precautions were adopted, but, of course, the injury is done in most cases before they are reported to your Inspectors. It would be of great advantage if these cases were properly isolated; for, although the disease is not very infectious, still without an amount of sanitary precaution, such as is seldom adopted in private houses, the drains are apt to become infected, and thereby produce again the complaint in other houses. simple continued fever. Of the seven deaths registered as simple continued fever, there were three in the Parish of Hammersmith and four in the Parish of Fulham. Diseases registered under the above title take place from a variety of causes, but of course we would expect them to occur from a vitiated atmosphere. I IARRHŒA. Of the 110 deaths from diarrhoea there were 75 in the Parish of Hammersmith and 62 in the Parish of Fulham. The mortality from this cause was very excessive, owing, no doubt, to the warm summer. most of the cases were those of young children, but a few were those of aged persons. English cholera. Of the six deaths registered as English cholera, two took place in the Parish of Hammersmith and four in the Parish of 55 Fulham. These are really deaths from diarrhoea, which has a somewhat rapid course. They are not, in the ordinary sense of the word, infectious diseases, though caused and aggravated in many instances by the same circumstances. violent death3 and inquests. There were 74 deaths from violence, of which 5 took place in St. Peter's, 51 in St. Paul's, and 18 in Fulham, against 55 deaths occurring in the whole district the previous year. There were 16O inquests held against 113 the previous year. There were 11 in St. Peter's, 96 in St. Paul's, and 53 in Fulham. The great increase in the number of inquests and violent deaths is no doubt the natural result of the large addition to the population in the course of the year. deaths in public institutions. There were 307 deaths registered in public institutions, of which there were 56 in St. Paul's, and 251 in Fulham. Of the 56 in St. Paul's there were 41 males and 15 females. They all took place in the West London Hospital. Of the 251 in Fulham, 110 took place in the Fulham Workhouse (56 males and 54 females), 135 in the Fulham Smallpox Hospital (76 males and 59 females), and six females in the Fulham Cancer Hospital. Besides these numbers, there were two. deaths registered in the Female Convict Prison, Fulham Town. pigeries, The attention of your Board was much engaged during the year with the question of the nuisances occasioned by swine keeping. By direction of vour Board, legal proceedings were taken against 13 pig keepers in the so-called Fulham fields, with the view of abolishing the same. It was found necessarv to employ counsel, as a most determined defence was made, and local medical evidence was adduced with the intention of proving that swine could be kept without being injurious to health. The learned Magistrate, however, decided the case on the ex pert evidence adduced by your board, ignored the medical evi dence for the defence, and granted orders with costs as prayed for. I need hardly state that this is a step in the right direction, and we may fairly hope lor a like success, in any future proceedings that your Board may think fit to take There are still a great number of swine in the district so kept as to be a nuisance and injurious to health. A.t the time of my writing this report legal proceedings are ordered against certain other Pig keepers in the parish of Fulham. I trust that a like success will be the result in favour of your Board. 56 licensed cow houses. Much of your Inspectors' time was employed in the improvement of the licensed cowhouses. Your Board thought fit to require 18'2 alterations to be made, and accordingly notice was given to the several cow keepers. The orders were not however, in many instances complied with and it was found necessary to oppose several of the licenses. The learned Bench of Justices decided that the requirements of your Board were necessary and adjourned the applications in order to give opportunity to the cow keepers to comply with your orders. slaughter houses. The slaughter houses of the district were kept under constant inspection during the year. They were found in most instances to be well managed in confirmily with the Sluaghter house regulation act. bake houses. The bake houses of the district were frequently inspected during the year, but owing to the fact that the Bake-house Regulation Act is repealed by the Factory Act. 1878, no action was of course taken up by your Board, except in case, of nuisances existing thereon. dust heaps D uring the year several complaints were received from inhabitants in the immediate neighbourhood of brick making There can be no doubt that a aerious nuisance is often occasioned through the accumulation of large quantities of ashes and other refuse matter. This being a process of trade it is difficult to effectually prevent the nuisance, no legal proceedings were taken, but some improvement was obtained through the several contractors adopting the suggestions of your Board. sanitary work. The inspection of the district not being as systematically carried out as it could be desired, your Board thought fit to go into committee on the subject. Still, however, the serious consideration of your Board is required before we can expect the ordinary sanitary work to be carried out as is desirable. The want of accommodation, owing to the alterations in the office, prevent at present the adoption of a well-organised system. It must be allowed that some improvement has taken place in this direction; but more strict sanitary supervision will in future be necessary to meet the requirements of this rapidly increasing district. water and water supply. The water supply of this district is chiefly obtained from 57 two companies, the Chelsea and the West Middlesex. The average amount of water supplied daily to each house was, Chelsea, 233 gallons, and West Middlesex, 159 gallons. The maximum amount of organic pollution in the Thames waters was, *36 per 100,000 parts of water in December. The organic elements consistedchiefly of organic carbon. Of the waters supplied from the Thames, that delivered by the Chelsea Company was the best. The average proportion of total combined nitrogen in 100,000 parts of Thames water was .291 parts. The average hardness of the Thames water delivered in London was 19.5 parts in 1877, and 20.3 parts in 1878. Owing to the frequent and heavy floods the river waters were frequently much polluted and very difficult to filter. METEOROLOGY. The mean reading of the Barometer was 29.75l inches. The highest temperature by day was 85.8 Fahrenheit in June. The lowest temperature by night was 12°2 Fahrenheit in December. The mean temperature for the year was 49°6. Rain fell on 166 days. The total rain fall was 29.0 inches. DISINFECTING APPARATUS. After long consideration your Board decided to erect a disinfecting apparatus and chose the Stone Wharf, Chancellors, for the site. Much opposition was offered by the inhabitants. In fact, a public meeting was held with the view of petitioning you not to erect the apparatus in that locality. No evidence being offered that injury was likely to be occasioned, your Board persisted in the original intention. I am able to state that no case of infectious disease has been traced to the use of the apparatus. About 780 infected articles were disinfected in the course of the year. The resultshavebeen mostsatisfactory. No case of disease has been known to occur after using the articles, showing that the process of disinfection has been complete. No complaints have been made that the articles have been injured through the process, although they are exposed to the vapour of sulphurous Acid gas, at a temperature of 250 deg. Fahrenheit, for three hours. The estimated amount saved by disinfection, instead of burning, was £624. The apparatus having been in use only nine months, has already more than paid for itself. The original expense was £280. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, N. C. COLLIER, Medical Officer of Health. Copstone House, Hammersmith. APPENDIX No. 6.
