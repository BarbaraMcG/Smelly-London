General Report of Works executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1865-66. b 11 To the Chairman and Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, 25th March, 1866. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, At the expiration of another year, during which I have had the honor of acting as your Surveyor, I beg to submit a Summary of the principal Works executed in my department. (See pages 15 and 16.) The list presented is a very limited one, compared with those of other Districts, as, from the central position of this Parish, it is quite clear that little can be reported in connection with the formation of New Streets, and the traffic being so great, the Paved Streets are never left to get in thoroughly bad condition, but in order to avoid public inconvenience, are constantly maintained by small repairs, so that the necessity for frequent entire relays is avoided. This way of maintaining our streets is done by a very 12 limited staff of men, and of the two ways is by far the most troublesome; the anxiety and watchfulness required being constant, though, it must be admitted, for a limited number of years it appears to be economical; although, having in in the course of the present year exhausted our stock of pitching stone, the cost of the material to carry on future repairs will be greatly increased. The cost of these repairs is merged in the contractor's charges for stone, &c. and the workmen's wages. (See pages 3 and 5.) In addition to the maintenance of the public ways, the Vestry undertakes and performs considerable works for Gas and Water Companies, and for private individuals, who may from any cause have reason to disturb the paving, but the actual cost of those works being re-imbursed to the Vestry, the particulars are not here set forth. The only Paving Works recorded, are a Cab Stand in St. James's Square, a small portion of the carriageway in South Row, and the footways and channels in Portland Street—the latter being the most important work, and one almost of necessity as it does not appear to have received much attention from the time the street was originally formed. The Sewers Works executed, comprise many gullies cleansed, seven trapped, and five re-built. The only old sewers that have been cleansed and repaired, have been works of actual necessity, 13 but the subject of the defective state of the local sewerage generally, and of Regent Street in particular, has frequently been brought under the notice of the Vestry, and is still engaging their serious attention. Much has been done in the way of letting off choked gullies and drains, and clearing off accumulations from various sewers; a great deal of this description of work has been accomplished in the course of the year, but as it is considered part of the routine work of the Vestry, the cases are not specially recorded. It will be seen that but little has been done with regard to Public Urinals or conveniences of that description; this has not been from any want of desire to add to the number and efficiency of those already in use, but from a feeling almost of hopelessness in the matter, two obstacles never failing to present themselves, one of expense and the other of suitable site, and however the former might be overcome, the latter appears insurmountable. During the nine years I have had the honor of serving as your Surveyor, I have almost exhausted my invention on the subject, and can bear witness to the labors of the Vestry and Works Committee to contrive some feasible plan for these necessary conveniences, but none has yet been propounded. The importance of the subject, however, on sanitary grounds, demands that it should still be kept in agitation, so that 14 no plan that seems at all practicable should be abandoned without due deliberation. In conclusion I beg to refer you to pages 6 and 7 for a list of all Contracts entered into and continued by the Vestry during the year. I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, A. P. HOWELL, Vestry Surbeyor. 15 GENERAL WORKS, &c. executed by The Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, from 25th March, 1865, to 25th March, 1866. Situation. Description of Work. Cost. Total.

F.R.S. F.L.S. &c. &c. CORONER FOR MIDDLESEX, AND MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. A 3 TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. James's, Westminster. Reverend Sir, My Lords, and Gentlemen, It becomes my duty to lay before you my Annual Report for the year 1865, making my tenth Report since I have had the honor of holding the post of Medical Officer of Health in your Parish. This Report will be accompanied as usual with a table of the causes of death for each quarter, and in each division of the Parish, and a summary of the Sanitary Inspector's work. These documents embrace a large number of important facts, to some of which I have been in the habit of calling your attention in years past, more especially those which have called forth either special remarks from myself in my fortnightly Reports, or special action on the part of the Vestry. MORTALITY OF THE YEAR 1865. The gross mortality of the Parish is a fact which first demands our attention, and I find that during the past year the number of deaths amounted 4 to 704. With two exceptions, (the years 1856 and 1858), this is the lowest death rate which has occurred in the Parish during the last ten years. In order that you may see what is the comparative mortality of each year, I present a table of death from the year 1856 to 1865:— Year. Deaths. 1856 682 1857 712 1858 669 1859 764 1860 723 1861 758 1862 727 1863 757 1864 832 1865 704 The number of deaths is 128 less than in 1864. In my last Report I showed you that this excessive death in 1864 depended on extreme cold. The average mortality of the 10 years is 732, so that the mortality of the last year is much below the average. These ten years have however been ten years of sanitary activity, and the comparison of one year with another, therefore cannot be regarded as any test of the value of our sanitary action. In order therefore that this may be fully tested, I call your attention to the average death of the Parish for ten years before 1856; the average death in those 5 ten years was 775, so that the average death rate has been reduced during the last ten years by 43. I now proceed to examine the details of the causes of death as presented in the four first tables. It is always convenient to divide the deaths into Zymotic and Non-Zymotic, as the former are regarded as diseases more particularly under the control of sanitary activity. It will however be seen from the following table of the total deaths from Zymotic diseases of all forms, that they vary in amount more than any other form of disease. Year. Total Cases of Disease. 1855 130 1856 85 1857 93 1858 70 1859 121 1860 80 1861 111 1862 135 1863 126 1864 100 1865 93 In this respect the year 1865 bears favourable comparison with previous years. The liability of one form of these diseases to gain ascendancy over the others, will be seen by the following table, which gives the entire number of each particular form of Zymotic disease for the last four years. 6  1862. 1863. 1864 1865. Diarrhœa 13 20 15 27 Hooping Cough, 33 22 29 17 Measles, 9 24 29 17 Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, 66 31 13 20 Small Pox, 1 21 . . 2 Typhus and Typhoid, 13 8 14 10 135 126 100 93 There are two features in the returns of last year worthy of notice, and these are the increase of Diarrhoea and the decrease of Typhus. DIARRHŒA AND CHOLERA. From the foregoing table it will be seen that in 1865 there had been a larger number of cases of Diarrhœa than in the three preceding years, and it will be seen from the following table that in the preceding nine years there had been only one year, 1857, in which the deaths from Diarrhoea had reached so high a figure. DEATHS FROM DIARRHŒA. 1855 1856 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 11 15 31 12 20 5 10 13 20 15 27 At the time that this high mortality from Diarrhœa prevailed, there was unquestionable evidence that Asiatic Cholera had once more gained access to the Continent of Europe, and had appeared in more than one of the sea-ports of England. I 7 have always advocated the theory that Asiatic or epidemic Cholera is a communicable disease, and that it spreads in no other way than by the passing of the poison from one human body to another. Acting on this theory, I felt assured that this dangerous disease had gained access to our shores, and only needed to be left to itself, to spread desolation throughout the land. It had visited us too late in the season to lead me to suppose that it would spread extensively before the following season; but, I felt that active measures should be taken during the ensuing winter season, and at the request of the Vestry, I drew up the following Report:— "I have been requested by the Vestry to point "out any course of action which I think ought to "be taken, in order to prevent the introduction and "spread of Cholera, should it unhappily prevail in "the Metropolis. "As one of the great barriers to all plans of "action for the prevention and arrest of the progress "of contagious diseases, is the ignorance of the "people, I should recommend that the Vestry draw "up some plain directions to be circulated throughout "the Parish, with regard to the nature, and means "of propagation of the disease called Cholera. "In the next place I would recommend that every "precaution be taken to prevent the introduction "into, and spread of Cholera in the Parish. It is "of the utmost importance that the first cases of "Cholera be reported, and that any and every 8 "family in which it occurs, should be instructed "with regard to the nature of the disease, and the "precautions which ought to be taken to prevent its "spread. Already the Reports of the Parochial "Medical Officer provide for the register of all "cases of Zymotic disease; but, these returns are "only sent in weekly, and should cases of Cholera "occur, their existence should be immediately made "known. These returns do not apply to private "medical practitioners, and it would be very ''desirable could any arrangement be made, that all "medical men should communicate with the local "authorities of their Parishes, whenever a case of "Cholera occurs. "In all instances where Cholera is present, the "local authorities should offer assistance and advice, "for the purpose of preventing the spread of the "disease. And where direct assistance is declined, "advice should be given, and any infringement of "laws made for the protection of the public health, "should be visited with the utmost severity. "As the emanations from water-closets, drains, "and sewers, and the contamination of cisterns and "wells are known to propagate Cholera, increased "vigilance should be observed about these matters. "1. All defective closets and drains should at "once be made good, and immediate prosecution "take place where landlords of premises refuse to "comply with the requirements of the Medical "Officer of Health. 9 "2. The sewers should be thoroughly cleansed, "and all accumulation of sewage matter be removed. "3. All gully-holes should be properly trapped. "4. When the sewers by their construction and "position are a constant source of nuisance to the "neighbourhood, by emitting foul and disgusting "odours, they should be ventilated. "5. As the water of surface wells is known to "be the most constant and fertile source of Cholera, "in this and the other countries of Europe, I "recommend that all the wells of the Parish be kept "under lock and key, as long as any tendency to "Cholera exists. I would remind you here of the "recommendation of the Report of your own "Committee in 1855, in which you say, 'That not " 'only on the ground of their liability to special " 'contamination, but from the fact of their constant " 'habitual and unavoidable impurity, the surface " 'wells of the Parish be no longer allowed to be " 'used for drinking purposes.' "6. That in the prospect of a visitation of "Cholera, the condition of cisterns and water-butts "be especially attended to; and that when they are "in direct communication with the effluvia of water"closets, they be removed. "7. That all those districts and localities "where Cholera prevailed in 1854 be visited, with "a special view to ascertain if any nuisances exist, "which are likely to produce a predisposition to "take the poison of Cholera." 10 In conclusion I would say, that I believe your Parish to be in a much better state to resist the invasion of Cholera, than it was in 1854. At the same time, I would earnestly implore the Vestry not to disregard this important matter as the Vestry did in 1854, and by their neglect of all sanitary provision, bring upon the Parish so awful a visitation, as the unparalleled outbreak of Cholera, which more than decimated the district of Broad Street, Golden Square, in 1854. IMPURE WATER. At the hazard of wearying you on the subject of impure water, I must again express my conviction that this is one of the great sources of the spread of Cholera. This arises from the fact, that the poison from the body of persons suffering from Cholera, may be easily introduced into drains and cesspools, and from thence find its way to wells and rivers. The water supplied to London from the Thames and New River, is now so thoroughly filtered, that but little danger appears to exist, of Cholera being communicated by the ordinary supply from the cistern. Nevertheless, during the prevalence of Cholera and Diarrhoea, as a matter of precaution, all water should be either boiled or filtered before it is drunk. It is however from surface wells that the greatest danger is to be apprehended. It was on this ground that I recommended the surface wells of 11 the Parish to be closed, as long as there was any danger from Diarrhoea or Cholera. In doing this I only followed the example of a Committee appointed by your Vestry in 1855, and which recommended that both on the ground of their liability to special contamination, and their constant habitual and unavoidable impurity, the surface wells of the Parish be closed and not allowed to be resorted to for drinking purposes at all. In my Report for the year 1857, I published letters from J. Simon, Esq. Medical Officer of the Privy Council, from Dr. Letheby, Medical Officer of Health of the City of London, the late Dr. R. D. Thomson, and thirty other Medical Officers of Health in London; all strongly recommending the permanent closure of the surface wells of London, on account of their necessary and habitual impurity, and the consequent danger to the health of those who drink water from this source. TYPHUS FEVER. Under the head of Typhus Fever is included a fever of analogous symptoms, which is known by the names of Gastric, Typhoid, and Drain Fever. These fevers prevail extensively in London at all times, and during the year 1865 were epidemic. It is a matter for congratulation, that whilst all around were suffering from these diseases during that year, that but ten persons lost their lives in Saint James's. Although 12 from our overcrowding we are naturally exposed to Typhus, I attribute our exemption from this disease to the high wages earned by our artisan population, which enable them to live more generously than the poor of other parts of London, and also to the active sanitary measures adopted when cases of this disease have broken out. Nevertheless, we have not escaped the imputation of being habitually exposed to the devastating influence of Typhus Fever. In a letter written to The Times Newspaper in September, Dr. Jeaffreson spoke of the prevalence of Typhus Fever in Little Windmill Street, Lambeth. The Times in a leading article mistook the reference, and accused Little Windmill Street, St. James's, as being the habitual seat of Typhus Fever. As this was likely to injure the trade of the inhabitants of Little Windmill Street, I wrote the following letter to The Times Newspaper:— To the Editor of The Times. Sir,—My attention has been called to a statement in a leading article in your paper of the 9th of September, in which, remarking on a letter by Dr. Jeaffreson on the prevalence of typhus in the Metropolis, you say it is not so much that typhus exists in St. James's, Westminster, as that it prevails in Little Windmill Street. Now, Sir, if you will turn to Dr. Jeaffreson's letter, you will see that he never once refers to St. James's, Westminster, at all, but that after speaking of St. George's, Bermondsey, he proceeds to speak of Lambeth, and here refers to Little Windmill Street. In order to satisfy myself upon this point, I have written to Dr. Jeaffreson, and he informs me that the Little Windmill Street he referred to is situate in the parish of Lambeth, and 1 13 near the New Cut. As the statement appears to have produced some anxiety amongst the inhabitants of St. James's, Westminster, perhaps you will allow me, through your columns, to say that only one death from typhus has occurred in Little Windmill Street, St. James's, since January 1862, and that I have received information of the existence of nine such cases which have all recovered. Although in the Berwick Street Division of St. James's we have the most thickly populated district in London for its size, having 10,608 persons on 25 acres of ground, we have had during the last ten years only 109 fatal cases of typhus and typhoid fever. This is about one death from fever in 3000 of the population annually. This is below the death rate of most other parishes in London, and I attribute it to the active measures sanctioned by the Vestry. Whenever typhus or typhoid fever breaks out, when it is possible, the person is immediately removed to the Workhouse or Fever Hospital, and the Sanitary Inspector is sent with directions to remove the family if possible, and at all events to have the rooms cleansed and whitewashed, and other means of disinfection and purification adopted. I am convinced that the only means of arresting the progress of these diseases in the present condition of our population is to attack individual cases, and promptly to put in action all known agencies for the destruction and prevention of the spread of the poison which propagates these fevers. It is the same with scarlet fever and other contagious diseases, unless the greatest possible precautions are taken for the dilution and destruction of the poison, it is impossible to arrest their progress amongst persons predisposed to take the disease. I am, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER. As this letter was not inserted, I wrote some time after a second and shorter letter, but neither 14 of them were inserted. I also received the following communication in answer to a letter I addressed to Dr. Jeaffreson on the subject:— 24, George Street, Croydon,—S. 3rd October, 18G5. My dear Dr. Lankester, As far as my recollection serves me, yon are quite right in what you say concerning your Little Windmill Street, which was not mentioned in the letter I sent to The Times. The street of that name referred to in the letter was mentioned in connection with the parish of Lambeth, and is bordering on the New Cut, as it is called in that district. I have left the L. F. H. but I have no doubt that should you want any returns for any locality in which you may bo interested, my successor, Mr. C. E. Squarey, will furnish thern with much pleasure. Relieve me, Sir, Ever yours faithfully, HORACE JEAFFRESON. Edwin Lankester, M.D. 8, Savile Row. SMALL POX. Amongst the Zymotic diseases of 1865 there arc two cases of Small Pox. After the epidemic of 1864, these cases may be regarded as the last of that epidemic, as they occurred in the first quarter of the year. It ought however to be recollected, that London is now suffering again from an epidemic of Small Pox which has not yet culminated. That England should suffer so severely from Small Pox must be regarded as a great disgrace to its 15 population, as the means of preventing it is universally known. The legislation that has been attempted on this point, has been utterly futile, and in no parish in London has vaccination been so general as to exclude the danger of Small Pox. I last year reported that the attempt made to superintend the vaccination of the children in your Parish had failed. The following extract from my fortnightly Report, made January 5th, 1865, will give you an idea of the nature of the efforts which were made:— "During the past year the Inspector has con"tinued his inquiries with regard to the vaccination "of children. He has seen upwards of 1200 "children, and 500 still remain upon the books to "be seen. Of the children visited, 500 were found "vaccinated, and 118 unvaccinated. Of these "91 have been since vaccinated. This then is the "real value of his labours: 91 children have been "vaccinated, who would probably have been left to "catch and spread the Small Pox. 155 children "were removed; 81 were dead; 64 the address "given was wrong; 6 refused to give any informa"tion; 151 only had preserved the vaccination "certificate. Very few of the medical practitioners 1"return the vaccination certificate to the Registrar, ''Which they are required to do by the Act, and some "parishes I find have threatened proceedings unless "this is done. The medical men refuse on the "ground that they are not paid for the certificate. 10 "I do not sympathise with my medical brethren on "this point. I think the first duty of a citizen is "to obey the law, and can only express my regret "that so respectable a body of men, should set so "bad an example. If they are suffering from any "hardship or oppression, the same course is open "to them as to others, and they can claim relief at "the hands of the Government." As the result of my experience in the matter of vaccination, I would suggest the adoption of the following changes:— 1. Before any effectual supervision of vaccination can be instituted, there must be a compulsory system of registration of births. At the present moment there is neither compulsory registration of births or deaths in this Country; and with regard to vaccination, there can be no superintendence of it, unless it is accurately known what children are born. 2. The children born being known, there should be some officer appointed whose duty it should be to see that every child born was vaccinated. This duty I think could be performed through the Registrar-General's office, who already collects the imperfect Statistics of Births and Deaths, which are from time to time published. 3. In the case of the poorer classes, who are 17 vaccinated by vaccinators appointed by the Poor Law Board, I would suggest that larger sums than one shilling and one shilling and sixpence should be given to medical men for the performance of this operation. They should not be given the lowest sum they are willing to take : but they should be paid a remuneration sufficient to induce them to look after each case, and perform the operation with requisite care. NON-ZYMOTIC DISEASES. There is a general diminution of cases of death amongst these diseases in 1865, but it is most marked amongst the group of disorders of the chest. This is undoubtedly to be attributed to the comparative mildness of the temperature of the first and second quarters of the year 1865; for although the winter was long the cold was not intense, and it was followed in the Spring and Summer quarters with remarkable mild and genial weather. The deaths from Consumption were 93, which is a less mortality than had occurred for many previous years, as will be seen by the following table :— DEATHS FROM CONSUMPTION. 1857 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 1863 1864 1865 87 99 101 112 97 113 101 115 93 B 18 In my previous reports I have dwelt on the causes of Pthisis in our overcrowded districts, and I shall not say anything more now on this point. Although the mortality was less for 1865 than previous years, it is too much to hope that the diminution depends on any sanitary improvements that are likely to be permanent. ACCIDENTS IN THE STREETS. On several occasions during the year 1865,1 called the attention of the Vestry to means for preventing accidents in the streets. During the long frost at the beginning of the year, the neglect of removing the snow from the streets and pavements, was the cause of many accidents, some of which were attended with loss of life. It is much to be desired that arrangements should be made for the removing of snow, from the streets and pavements during the winter. During the winter also the streets are often rendered dangerous by the frost, and a large amount of life and property is sacrificed for the want of some parochial arrangement, by which means could be employed for removing or rendering less slippery, the ice upon the roads. In my Report to Vestry on the 1st of June, 1865, I drew attention to the increase of accidents in the streets, of which the following is an extract:— "My attention has been drawn to the great "increase of street accidents, in this and other 19 "Parishes with large thoroughfares, in the Metro"polis. The number of street accidents causing "death last year in London, was upwards of 250. "At one hospital where I made inquiry, I found "that where they had one death, they had 50 "patients suffering from the same class of accidents. "This gives the enormous number of 12,500 per"sons suffering from this cause every year in "London. I think three things might be done, to "diminish this awful amount of death and suffering. "1. In our crowded thoroughfares bridges for "foot-passengers might be erected, which would "enable them to avoid passing between the "vehicles. Such structures should be ornamental. "Their base might be connected with public urinals, "and they might be constructed at a small expense. "2. A law might be passed, forbidding "carriages to go over foot crossings, or turn round "corners, otherwise than at a walking pace. "3. The opening up of side streets, and the "widening of those which exist, in the neighbour"hood of all our great thoroughfares." I leave these suggestions for your thought and approval. WORK ROOMS. In my previous reports I have often referred to the condition of the work rooms and sleeping rooms of the great dress making and tailoring establishments of this Parish as a source of many diseases, but 20 more especially of diseases of the lungs, and Consumption in particular. During the year, I had my attention called to the sleeping rooms in one of our large millinery establishments, and after some difficulty obtained access to the rooms complained of, and found them quite unfitted for the accommodation of the number of persons who were alleged to have slept in them. I believe, however, in this case as in many others, that the proprietor was not really aware of the danger to which he exposed the lives of those he employed, and expressed his willingness at once to make the necessary alterations to render the rooms more healthful. The great deficiencies of both our work rooms and sleeping rooms in the great establishments are over-crowding and want of ventilation. With regard to over-crowding in bed rooms, this is especially the case where young women are employed, and many of them sleep in rooms with not more than from two to three hundred cubic feet for each individual; I have said before, that I regard 500 cubic feet as the minimum that each individual should have in a sleeping room, but I believe a 1000 cubic feet is more consistent with health. In work rooms where young men or women have to work several hours a day, there should be at least 500 cubic feet of air for each individual. It should, however, be recollected, that a small space well ventilated is better for health than a large space badly ventilated; thus, a room shut up with 1000 cubic 21 feet for each. person might be worse for health than a room with 500 that was better ventilated. I find however, in all our rooms whether used for sleeping or work a deficiency of ventilation: in many houses of this Parish the upper sash of the window does not come down, and often rooms are used for sleeping with no fire-place, and doors and windows are kept closed, so as to prevent the escape of foul air, and the egress of pure air from without. Ventilation cannot be constantly secured in our dwelling houses by mechanical arrangements, what is really required everywhere is intelligent superintendence. A knowledge of the nature of heat and cold, of their effects on the human body, and of the methods of ventilating rooms is essential, on the part of the individuals, or some one of the individuals who reside in the house. The extensive use of gas in sleeping rooms and work rooms, is another complication of our present civilisation, which renders attention to ventilation of increasing importance. I pointed out, in one of my previous Reports, that with proper arrangements the burning of gas might be so arranged, as not only not to be a nuisance, but actually to facilitate the means of ventilation. Such an arrangement has been carried out by Mr. Ricketts in his "Ventilating "globe lights," and I strongly recommend that this principle be acted on wherever gas is-consumed. During the year 1885 I called your attention to the opening in Clifford Street, of a Dressmaking 22 Company, the object of which was to offer a model of the way in which such establishments should be conducted, in reference to the ventilation of the work rooms and sleeping apartments, and also of the hours of work required of the sempstresses employed. I was invited by the Committee of this establishment to confer with them, on plans to be adopted for securing the ventilation, and other sanitary arrangements of the house; and I believe they have been carried out to the fullest extent, and that the Association has worked most successfully as far as the health of the inhabitants is concerned. THE RUSSIAN AND EUROPEAN EPIDEMICS. During the early part of the year, Russia and the North of Germany were exposed to the ravages of epidemic diseases, which excited alarm in this country, lest they should invade our own shores, and produce the same disastrous effects in this country, which they had done in the places they were known to have devastated. On the 27th of April I made the following Report on these diseases. RUSSIAN PLAGUE. My attention has been drawn to the reports of an epidemic prevailing in Russia and North Germany, exhibiting a great mortality and pursuing the same course as the Cholera in 1831, 1848, and 1854. 23 The Government has sent two medical men, one to Russia and the other to North Germany, to report on this disease. From their account published by Mr. Simon, the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, it appears that the diseases ravaging Russia are two, both of which we are familiar with in this country, that is Typhus and Relapsing Fever. These, the fevers of over-crowded and starving populations, are well known in this country. On these diseases I have kept a watchful eye in this Parish; although during the last year we have had more Typhus than in any year since I have had the honor to hold the office of Medical Officer of Health, it has shown no tendency to become epidemic. Of Relapsing or Famine Fever, I cannot discover that we have had any cases; this fact, I ascribe to our population, however over-crowded they may be, being well fed. The great evil we have to contend with in St. James's, Westminster, is over-crowding, and to this I ascribe the largest amount of our removeable causes of disease. The disease which is afflicting the inhabitants of the banks of the Vistula and the lower provinces of Northern Germany, is a disease rarely seen in this country, and apparently most contagious. From the reports at present received, it does not appear that there is any occasion for alarm as to the introduction of any new forms of disease; but it does appear that at present, in spite of all our sanitary efforts, there is a tendency in the progress 24 of our civilisation to invite the causes of death and disease, and it is only by the most strenuous efforts and unceasing watchfulness that we can expect to keep the enemies of our health and life at bay, THE CATTLE PLAGUE. One of the most disastrous occurrences of the year, was the outbreak of a disease amongst our cows and oxen. This disease, which had visited this country 100 years since, and which is endemic on the steppes of Russia, is like Small Pox, a highly contagious disease, and is only propagated by the poison from a diseased animal coming in contact with one that has not had the disease. The only way of arresting such a disease is to prevent the contact of the healthy with the diseased. The most effectual way of doing this is by killing immediately every animal that exhibits any symptom of the disease; the hesitation on this point exhibited by the Government and their medical advisers led to the introduction of the disease into this country. It first broke out in the dairies of London, where the cows were more than decimated by the Plague. From thence it spread into the country, and was not arrested till after measures had been taken by the Government, at a great expense, to destroy all the cattle affected by the disease. Fortunately, this disease was no source of anxiety in your Parish as far as apprehended attacks of animals kept in cow+ 25 houses were concerned, as you had abolished the nuisance of cow houses two years before. Although it was apprehended that this disease by attacking cows might affect their milk sold in London, it does not appear that the milk sold retail, exhibited any taint from the prevalent disease; this arose probably, from the fact that one of the first symptoms of the disease was the disappearance of the milk of the animal; hence, as diseased animals never afforded milk, the supply of this important article was not affected.
