The Ex-Mayor. 2.On the 9th October it was unanimously resolved:— "That the best thanks of the Council be given to Coun- cillor James Wise, J.P., for his able, courteous, and impartial conduct in the Chair, and for the time and attention bestowed by him in the discharge of his duties as Mayor of this Borough." 3. The General Purposes Committee were instructed to prepare an address expressing the Council's high appreciation of Councillor Wise's services, and the following address was engrossed, framed, and sealed with the Common Seal of the Council, and presented to Councillor Wise at the Meeting of the Council on the 9th November, viz.:— Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Population. Area. Rateable Value. 308,663 9,221 acres. ,£2,005,347. To James Wise, Esq., J.P. We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, desire to convey to you our heartiest thanks for the valuable services which you have rendered to the Borough as Mayor from November, 1906, to November, 1907. It was your privilege to be entrusted with the presentation to Their Majesties King Edward and Queen Alexandra of an Address of Welcome from the Council on the 24th July, 1907, when Their Majesties visited the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum, Wandsworth Common, in commemoration 28 of the Jubilee of the Foundation of that Institution, to which Address Their Majesties made a most gracious reply. Amongst other Public Ceremonies at which you have represented the Council was the laying of the Foundation Stone of the St. Andrew's Parish Hall, at Earlsfield, by Her Royal Highness the Princess Christian. During your Mayoralty the Lord Mayor of London made an appeal for the sum of £60,000 for the purpose of establishing an Institution for the care and relief of Crippled Children, in whose welfare his Lordship has for many years taken great interest. The energetic action which you took in support of the scheme has resulted in raising in this Borough a sum of over £600 in aid of this philanthropic project. We cordially acknowledge your generous hospitality, which has been extended to all classes of the inhabitants of the Borough, and the able, courteous, and impartial manner in which you have discharged your magisterial duties and presided over the Meetings of the Council. Our best thanks are also due to the Mayoress for her graceful and untiring services in assisting you in the numerous Social and Public Functions which have taken place during your year of office. We feel sure that the year of your Mayoralty will always be to you and to the Mayoress a pleasurable reminiscence, and we sincerely trust that the Borough may for many years to come have the advantage of your valued services as a Member of the Council. Presentation to Mayoress 4.At the same Meeting, Councillor Anderson, on behalf of the subscribers (Members of the Council), presented to Mrs. Wise, as a mark of appreciation of her services in the discharge of the duties of Mayoress, a pearl necklet and pendant.

The following is a copy of the address, and of His Majesty's reply, viz.:— TO THEIR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTIES KING EDWARD AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA. The Loyal and Dutiful Address of the Mavor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, under their common seal. WE, Your Majesties' most loyal and dutiful subjects, humbly approach your Majesties, and desire to express our deep gratification at your visit to this Borough in commemoration of the Jubilee of the Foundation, in the year 1857, of the Royal Victoria Patriotic Asylum for Orphan Children of Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines. 'We rejoice that Your Majesties have shown in the welfare of this Institution the same warm interest with which it has been honoured by her late beloved Majesty Queen Victoria, and by many other members of the Royal Family, to whose sympathy and support it is deeply indebted. The site of the Institution comprises forty acres formerly part of the Common by which it is surrounded, and as an open space is of great value to the large population of the two adjoining Boroughs of Battersea and Wandsworth. During the fifty years which have elapsed since the Institution was established this population has increased from about 60,000 to over 500,000 and is still rapidly increasing. it is less than a month since Your Majesties graciously opened in an adjacent Borough the Union Jack Club, also for the benefit of men serving in the Army and Navy, and your presence on this interesting occasion is another instance of the readiness of Your Majesties to 30 promote the success of Institutions established for the advancement of the best interests of the Services of the Crown. It is our earnest hope that Your Majesties may long live to reign over a loyal and prosperous people. Sealed by Order, (Signed) James Wise, Mayor. Hen. Geo. Hills, Town Clerk. HIS MAJESTY THE KING'S REPLY. IN behalf of the Queen and myself I thank you for your loyal and dutiful address. I am glad to take this opportunity of meeting the representatives who have been chosen by my people to regulate the affairs of this important Borough. The object of my visit, to which you allude with so much sympathy, is one which must appeal to all those who have the welfare of their country at heart. The men of my Navy and Army have ever been distinguished for bravery and devotion, and no public effort is more worthy of support than an1 endeavour to provide for the orphan girls of those who have died in< the service of their country. I rejoice in the success of an institution which bears the name of Queen" Victoria, my dear and ever to be lamented mother. I wish it every success in the future, and I share with you the gratification which we must all feel in the promotion of this worthy and patriotic object. Church Serviees, &c. 9. The Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors and principal officers of Council attended in state services at the follow- ing churches in the Borough, viz.:— 8th Dec., 1907 Parish Church of Clapham, Holy Trinity, Clapham Common. 26th Jan., 1908 Parish Church of Wandsworth, All Saints', High Street. 9th Feb., 1908 Parish Church of Putney, St. Mary, High Street. 8th March, 1908 Parish Church of Streatham, St. Leonard, Streatham High Road. 31st May, 1908 Parish Church of Tooting, St. Nicholas, Church Lane. 28th June, 1908 St. Anne's Church, St. Ann's Hillt Wandsworth. 31 io.

Representation of Wards. 11. The Local Government Board Inquiry into the representation of the Wards of the Borough, referred to in the last report (page 37), was held at the Council House on the 18th November, 1907. Plans and statistics prepared by the Council's officers showing the area, rateable value, and population of each of the existing Wards, the Polling Districts, and the Rate Collectors' Districts, and of suggested reapportionments, were put in evidence, and the Council expressed the opinion that the facts which determine the apportionment of Members amongst the Wards change so quickly in the Borough that any re-arrangement at the present time would be of short duration; and, moreover, there having been no official census since 1901, the population must be taken as at that time, which would be very misleading, or be based upon estimates which may be inaccurate; that an alteration of the Wards of the Borough at present would be premature; and that no further steps should be taken in the matter until the result of the Census of 1911 is known. Several residents in the Borough gave evidence in favour of and against any alteration being made in the representation of the respective Wards. In February, 1908, the Local Government Board informed the Council that, having considered the evidence given at the Inquiry with reference to the proposals for the alteration of the number of Wards and of the apportionment of the Members of the Council among the Wards together with the report of their Inspector thereon, the Board had come to the conclusion that no sufficient case had been made out for giving effect to the proposals at the present time. 12. In June, 1907, the Council passed the following resolution, viz.:— Suggested Division of the Borough. "That in the opinion of this Council it will not be for the benefit of the Borough that any part of it shculd be separated therefrom." 32 Metropolitan Borough Council's Association. 13. The Mayor (Alderman Lorden), Councillor Anderson and the Town Clerk were re-elected this Council's representatives on the Metropolitan Borough Councils' Association for the current year.

Crippled Children. 16. The total sum received on the Wandsworth Borough List in aid of the Lord Mayor's Cripples' Fund was £631 16s. 2d. An audited statement was sent to each subscriber, and the Council congratulated the ex-Mayor (Councillor Wise) on the highly successful result of his efforts in aid of the Fund. Veterans Fund. 17. In February, 1908, the Mayor (Alderman Lorden) opened a list for the Borough in aid of the Fund which was being raised for the relief of the Indian Mutiny and 'Crimean Veterans, the proposal being that those who were in Vorkhouses should be removed and given pensions, and that any others who required it should be assisted so as to prevent their going into the workhouse. The amount received on the Borough list was £150 9s. 10d. Putney Charities. 18.

Theperiod for which Alderman Lorden and Councillor Buchanan (Springfield Ward), Mr. J. l^uscombe (Fairfield Ward), and Alderman Rucker (Southfield Ward) were appointed Representative Trustees of the Wandsworth Consolidated Charities, having expired, the Council on the 24th April, 1907, re-appointed Alderman Lorden and Councillor Buchanan for the Spring-field Ward, and Alderman Rucker for Southfield Ward, and appointed Councillor Taylor for the Fairfield Ward to fill the vacancies. Weir Hospital Trust 21. In October last the Council considered the subject of an agreement which a majority of the Trustees and Committee of Management of the Weir Trust had entered into with the Committee of the Bolingbroke Hospital for expending a large part of the Trust Funds towards the completion and maintenance of that hospital, and an application which had been made to the Charity Commission to publish a scheme in accordance with the agreement, and passed the following resolutions thereon, viz. :— (a) That this Council, which is entrusted with the appointment of three members of the Committee for the administration of the Weir Trust, regrets the payment of the sum of ,£5,000 out of the funds of the Trust to the Bolingbroke Hospital, and objects to the proposal to divert the bulk of the funds to the completion of the building and to assist in the maintenance of that Institution. The clear intention of Mr. Weir's Will is the establishment of a separate Institution in and for the benefit mainly of Streatham, and this Council is of opinion that such an Institution should be established as soon as possible, and that the whole of the available funds should be devoted to that purpose. (b) That the Trustees and the Charity Commissioners be respectfully requested not to prepare or concur in any scheme for the administration of the Trust which includes the expenditure of any part of the fund in providing or maintaining a building outside the Parish of Streatham in which parish Mr. Weir lived and was specially interested. 22. Councillor Anderson and the Town Clerk attended a Public Inquiry held by the Charity Commission at the Balham Assembly Rooms on the 5th and 8th November, and supported the views of the Council. 23. The period for which Alderman Penfold, Mr. W. Dickinson and Mr. J. W.

On the 18th October, the Committee of Management passed the following- resolution, viz.:— (а) That this Committee disapproves of the agreement dated 29th July,. 1907, entered into by a majority of the Trustees and Committee of the Weir Trust with the Committee of Management of the Bolingbroke Hospital, and requests the Charity Commissioners not to prepare a scheme founded upon the provisions of such agreement, the said provisions being contrary to the intentions of the late Mr. Weir as expressed in his Will. (b) That the Committee proceed at once with the provision of a hospital in accordance with the Will. After considering the evidence given at the Public Inquiry, the Council, in December last, sealed and presented the following Memorial to the Charity Commission, viz. :— TO THE CHARITY COMMISSIONERS FOR ENGLAND AND WALES. The Memorial of the Mayor, Aldf.rmf.n, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. sheweth:— 1. That the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth comprises the ancient Parishes of Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting, and Wandsworth, having an area of fourteen-and-a-half square miles, a rateable value of £2,005,347, and a population of over 300,000. 2. That under the terms of the Will of the late Benjamin Weir, Esq., your Memoralists, as successors of the Streatham Vestry, have entrusted to them the nomination of three Members of the Committee of Management of the Weir Hospital Trust. 3. Your Memoralists have had under consideration the proceedings at the Local Inquiry held by the Charity Commissioners at Balham on the 5th and 8th November, 1907, with respect to the Trust; and desire to call attention to the very strong and practically unanimous opinion expressed! at the Inquiry by the Inhabitants of Streatham in opposition to the proposal to devote a large part of the Trust Funds to the Bolingbroke Hospital, and in favour of the establishment of a Dispensary, Cottage Hospital, or Convalescent Home or other Medical Charity, at the Testator's residence at Balham, in accordance with the directions contained in his Will, and also, if found practicable, of some similar provision being made for the requirements of the southern part of the Parish of Streatham. 4. That the Parish of Streatham has an area of 2,823 acres and a population of over 100,000, and that there is no Cottage Hospital or similar institution in the Parish. 35 5. That the late Mr. Benjamin Weir was for many years Chairman of the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District (which Board was superseded by this Council), and took a very active part in the local administration of the District. 6. That the Will contemplates the administration of the Trust in accordance with local opinion, inasmuch as one-half of the Committee of Management (or if the number of the Committee be increased to nine by the co-option of other persons two-thirds of the Committee) go out of office annually, thus providing that the prevalent opinion of the inhabitants shall have effect. 7. Your Memoralists agree with the opinion above referred to expressed at the Inquiry, and respectfully urge the Commissioners not to assent to the suggested diversion of any part of the capital of the Trust Funds to the Bolingbroke Hospital, and to leave the Committee to carry out with the income of the said Funds the declared intention of the Testator. The preparation of a scheme for the administration of the Trust Funds is still under the consideration of the Charity Commissioners. New streets Department. 25. Objection having been made by an owner of property to inclusion in an apportionment of the estimated cost of paving a new street, of charges for supervision and establishment expenses, the subject was referred to a Special Joint Committee, consisting of Members of the General Purposes Committee and the New Streets Committee for consideration and report. L'pon their recommendation a separate New Streets Department has been formed, comprising both the clerical and Surveyor's work, the persons employed in the department to be kept at New Streets work only. Duties and Cost of Staff. 26. During the year under report the Special Committee, which was appointed in January, 1907, to enquire as to the duties and cost of the staff and whether anv alterations were necessary, presented their report upon the reference to them. The Committee held four meetings, and a Subcommittee appointed by thetn held sixteen meetings and visited the various offices, wharves, and depots, saw the officers at their work, inspected the books and documents kept, and examined into the systems of work. In the result the Committee recommended the retirement of the Surveyor for the Eastern District and the appointment of a Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the whole Borough. This recommendation was adopted by the Council, Mr. H. J. Marten, the Surveyor for 36 the Kastern District, was granted a superannuation allowance, and Mr. P. Dodd, the Surveyor for the Western District, was appointed Borough Engineer and Surveyor. The offices of the Surveyor for the Eastern District at No. 215, Balham High Road, have been re-arranged so as to accommodate the whole of the staff of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and the offices of the Surveyor for the Western District at No. 75, High Street, Wandsworth, are now used for the Rating, Registration, and Burials Departments. The removal of these departments from the Wandsworth Town Hall, where the rooms available were unsuitable for offices, will enable the Council to provide better accommodation for letting the Hall for public meetings, entertainments, and other purposes. Licences. premises. 27.The Council objected to the renewal of three licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors on account of the condition of sanitary conveniences attached to the The necessary works having been carried out the objections were withdrawn. Unemployed Workmen Act. 28. The Council considered the subject of the re-enactment of the Unemployed Workmen Act, and decided to inform the Local Government Board that it was in favour of its re-enactment with amendments to provide :— (a) Permanent and useful work to meet the necessities of distress. (b) For the permanent settlement on land of men trained at farm colonies. (c) Other work than that for which only physically strong and trained men are capable. (d) An alternative to the Poor Law for those too old to work. (e) Increased national grants for technical education and encouragement of the apprenticeship system. (/) For the establishment of penal colonies for the detention of loafers and idlers. 29. For a report as to the work of the Distress Committee under the Unemployed Workmen Act see Appendix "J," page 264. 30. The Council appointed Alderman Lorden (Mayor), Councillors Campbell, Clark, Eaton, and Wallis, Members of the Local Advisory Committee for the Wandsworth Employment Exchange. 37 Electric Lightmg. 31. l ot some years past the Council has been in communica-. London County Council on the subject of provision by the County of London Electric Supply Company of stations to test the current supplied by the Company. In May, 1907, the County Council stated that the Company proposed to provide four such stations in this. Borough, one in Roehampton, one at East Hill, one at Clapham Cross, and the other at Streatham Hill. This Council consented to a testing apparatus being placed in the basement of the Council House, and the apparatus which has been fixed there is periodically inspected by the officers of the London County Council. Workmen's Compensation Act and Employers' Liability Act. 32. The Council considered the subject of the desirability of insuring against risks under these Acts, and has adjourned the consideration or the subject tor twelve months, during- which period a record will be kept of cases arising in which compensation is or might be payable under the Acts, and the subject turther considered. Disorderly Houses. 33. Enquiries were made in the few complaints received of alleged Disorderly Houses, but it was only necessary to take proceedings in one case, in respect of which the defendant was sentenced to one month's imprisonment, with hard labour, with a recommendation that at the end of his sentence he should be deported under the Aliens Act. Taxation of Land Values. 34. The Council considered the letter from the United Cornmittee of the Leagues for the Taxation of Land Values, forwarding a copy of resolution supporting the proposals of the Government to ascertain the land values of Great Britain, and to adopt such land values as the standard of rating, and suggesting that this Council should consider the urgency of passing a resolution in favour of the taxation of land values. In reply the Council decided to send a copy of the report on the subject of the Local Authorities (Taxation and Purchase of Land) Bill adopted by the Council on the 13th September, 1905 (See page 61 of the Report of the Council for the year ended 31 st March, 1906). Wandsworth infirmary 35. The Council considered the proposal of the Guardians of the Wandsworth Union to build a new Infirmary,, and on the 9th October passed the following resolution on the subject, viz.:— 38 "That in the opinion of this Council the proposal of the Wandsworth Guardians to erect a new Workhouse Infirmary on the St. James's Road, Battersea, site, at an estimated cost of ,£125,000, is inexpedient at the present time, inasmuch as "(1) The present accommodation, with the extra provision which is being made for 200 adult patients, will meet immediate requirements. "(2) The Local Government Board has already intimated that the separation of the Parish of Battersea from the Wandsworth Union will be granted in the near future, and upon that event the existing workhouse and the Tooting Home will be ample for the requirements of Wandsworth. "(3) That the ultimate cost of the buildings, fittings, furniture, and the establishment and maintenance charges, will involve a heavy extra burden on the Poor Rates, to which Battersea contributes onethird and Wandsworth two-thirds." A copy of the foregoing resolutions was sent to the Local Government Board and to the Wandsworth Guardians, and subsequently the Council passed the following further resolution on the subject, viz. :— "That, having regard to the widespread dissatisfaction of the Ratepayers of this Borough at the contemplated expenditure of the Guardians for the provision of a new Infirmary, this Council, as the elected Representatives of the Ratepayers and as the Body charged with the duty of providing the Guardians with Funds by levying the necessary Rate, requests the Local Government Board to hold a public Inquiry as to whether a new Infirmary is absolutely necessary at the present time." A copy of this resolution was also sent to the Local Government Board and the Wandsworth Guardians, and further correspondence took place between the Council and the Local Government Board on the subject, in which the Council urged that, in view of the suggested merging of the duties of the Poor Law Authorities in the General Municipal Government and the creation of a Central Poor Law Authority for London and of the large number of vacant places in the Workhouses and Infirmaries in London, the matter should await the report of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws. The Local Government Board, however, declined to hold a Public Inquiry and adhered to their decision, approving generally of the Guardians' proposals. Parliamentary Bills. 36. The following Parliamentary Bills were considered by the Council, viz. :— London County Council (Tramways and Improvements). London County Council (General Powers). 39 West London Barnes and Richmond Tramways. Croydon and Southern District Tramways. London and District Electricity Supply. London Electric Supply. Port of London. Polling- Arrangements (Parliamentary Boroughs) Polling Districts (County Councils). Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. Education Board Provisional Order Confirmaticn (London No. 1).

Qualification of Women (County and Borough Councils)- Shops (No. 3). Telegraph Construction. Unemoloved Workme.n. Voters (Qualification and Registration). c 40 London County Council (Tramways and improvements). 37. This Bill proposes to authorise the County Council to lay down and maintain tramways in various parts of London. The proposed tramways in this Borough are No. 8, to form a junction between the existing- tramways in High Street and Mitcham Road, on the north-eastern side of the Broadway, Tooting; and No. 9, from the termination of the existing tramway opposite the Tate Public Library along Streatham High Road to the County Boundary at Norbury. 38. The Bill would authorise the County Council to adopt a system of overhead electrical traction for working the tramway from Hammersmith across Putney Brdige to Lower Richmond Road, authorised by the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Act, 1902. 39. The Bill would also authorise the widening of Streatham High Road, on the western side north of Stanthorpe Road, and the increasing of the width of the carriageways at certain points in Tooting High Street, the Broadway, Mitcham Road, and at Streatham High Road, by reducing the width of footpaths to not less than 6 feet. The Councils of the Boroughs where the works are to be carried out (including Wandsworth) are to respectively contribute one-third of the cost of the widenings. 40. Clause 20 would authorise the County Council to acquire the land and premises lying between and adjoining High Street, Wandsworth, York Road, Ram Square, and the Town Hall, and to stop up and appropriate part of the roadway of Ram Square. 41. This Council was of opinion that before the proposed junction at High Street and Mitcham Road, Tooting, was constructed the road there should be widened so as to provide a space of 9 feet 6 inches between the kerb and the tramway rail and a footpath of not less than 9 feet in width. A Clause was subsequently agreed with the County Council for insertion in the Bill providing that, if at any time after the opening for traffic of the junction line in question this Council should determine that its working was a source of public danger, this Council might make representations upon the matter to the Board of Trade, and that If such Board upheld the representations of the Borough Council the County Council should either discontinue the use of the junc- 41 Ttion line or carry out such a street widening as would leave a space of 9 feet 6 inches between the kerb and the nearest rail of the tramway, with a footpath of a minimum width of 9 feet. This Council decided not to object to the use of overhead traction for the proposed tramway over Putney Bridge in view of the fact that the road authorities through which the greater part of the tramways in question will be laid did not oppose such system and of the small length of such line in this Borough. 42. Several interviews took place between Members and Officers of this Council, and Members and Officers of the London County Council, with the view of an agreement being come to as to the widening of Streatham High Road, paving works, and the other matters dealt with by the Bill, and an agreement has been entered into which provides that the County Council shall use its best endeavours to acquire the necessary land to widen Streatham High Road:— (a) Within ten years: Between No. 73 and Sunnyhill Road. (b) Within twenty years: Between Pinfold Road and No. 75. Between Mitcham Lane and Streatham Green. (c) Widenings to be carried out as opportunity shall arise: Forecourts of the Police Station and Almshouses. Forecourt of High School. At St. Leonard's Church-yard. At the Chimes, adjoining Streatham Common North. Land between Streatham Common South and No. 285, Streatham High Road (to the north and south of Voss Court). Forecourts of old cottages adjoining Streatham Lodge estate on the south and land adjoining such cottages. Land to the south of Green Lane. Forecourts and land on both sides of road to the north of Hermitage Bridge. The County Council is to pay two-thirds and the Borough Council one-third of the cost of the foregoing widenings, 42 ing the necessary alterations to and the paving of the public way in connection therewith. 43. Provisoes have been added with respect to the widenings (a) and (b) to the effect that the Borough Council shall and may, if necessary, exercise its powers under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act for the compulsory acquisition of property. The widenings in (c) are subject also to the County Council being able to acquire the land at such prices as they shall be willing to pay. 44. The draft agreement also provided with reference to the County Council acquiring the piece of land on the west side of Streatham High Road between Mitcham Lane and Streatham Green to widen the road to 60 feet, that if the Borough Council desired that the road should be widened to 70 feet the difference between the cost of widening to 6c feet and 70 feet respectively should be borne by the Borough Council. This Council objected to being bound to pay the whole of the cost of the additional widening and the clause has been struck out of the agreement. It will of course be possible to raise the question of widening the road to 70 feet before it is widened to 60 feet if the Borough Council should see fit to do so. 45. The agreement also provides that in constructing the proposed tramways the County Council shall lay wood paving,— (a) Where the overhead system of traction is used (except on Putney Bridge and so much of the approach thereto as is maintained by the County Council) between the outer rails and for 18 inches beyond the outer rails in all places where the road is woodpaved or where the Borough Council has determined to pave the road with wood. (b) Where any other system of traction is used, and the road is or is about to be paved with wood, for 18 inches beyond the outer rail. 46. The County Council is to endeavour to -btair. power (when they have acquired the necessary land to widen the road) to construct double lines of tramways in the portions of the road widened in lieu of the single lines provided for in the Bill, and the County Council shall not irl connection with the overhead system of traction erect standards, posts or other apparatus in the 43 riageway, nor erect standards, posts or other apparatus, under, upon or over any part of the public way, except in such positions as the Borough Council shall reasonably approve. 47. The County Council is to reduce and improve the gradients of Streatham High Road where reasonably practicable, but shall not be compelled to carry out works which would interfere with adjoining property or involve the payment of purchase money or compensation; and in stopping up Ram Square, Wandsworth, the County Council is not to stop up the highway to the east of line shown on the plan approved by this Council. 48. Upon the agreements being exchanged, this Council's opposition to the Bill was withdrawn, and the Bill has passed and received Royal Assent on the 1st August, 1908. London County (General Powers)Bill. 49. Part 11. dealt with unwholesome milk, and proposed to authorise the Medical Officer of the London County Council to take at any railway station samples of milk for examination, and to authorise the Medical Officer of Health of any Sanitary Authority to take samples of milk sold, offered, or exposed or deposited for sale at any place (not being a railway station) within the district, and that, if milk produced in any dairy outside the county should on examination of any sample taken at a railway station be found to contain any matter rendering it unwholesome or unfit for food, the Medical Officer of the London County Council may report thereon to such Council who could prohibit the supply of milk within the county from such dairy. 50. Part III. of the Bill contains sanitary provisions with reference to the registration of dairymen, the removal and disposal of trade refuse or any article of diseased or unsound food, the appointment of health visitors for the purpose of giving to persons in poor circumstances advice as to the proper nurture and care of young children, and of promoting cleanliness, the accommodation for the cooking of food in tenement houses, requirements as to premises where any food is sold or deposited for the purposes of sale or preparation for sale, to empower the County Council to make bye-laws for regulating the conduct of the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, fish-curer, and rag and bone dealer. 44 51. Part IV. would amend the provisions of the London Building Act, 1894; and Part X. contains miscellaneous and financial provisions among which is a Clause providing that in default of payment of precepts or sums payable for maintenance of patients in lunatic asylums by the date when due or within twenty-one days of date of precept, if later, interest is to be paid by Local Authority. 52. This Council approved of the clauses relating to unwholesome milk, provided that they were amended so as to authorise the Medical Officer of Health of a Sanitary Authority to require persons from whom samples of milk for examination are taken at any place other than a railway station to furnish him with information as to the dairy in which such milk was produced, and that a penalty should be imposed upon any person obstructing the Medical Officer of Health of a Sanitary Authority in taking samples of milk. 53. The clauses relating to milk supply were withdrawn by the London County Council, the President of the Local Government Board stating that the Government intended to introduce general legislation on the subject of milk supply at a later date. 54. The Bill as amended was passed and received Royals Assent on the 1st August. West London Richmond Tramways. 55. This Bill proposed to authorise a company to construct a. line tramway from Bridge Road, Hammersmith,, over Hammersmith Bridge, through Barnes and Mortlake along the Lower Richmond Road, to Kew Road, Richmond; and from Castlenau, Barnes, through Rocks Lane, over Barnes Common, along Upper Richmond Road and Sheen Road, to a point near the fire station at Richmond. The part of such tramways situate in this Borough was Tramway No. 11 (77 chains double line, and 2 furlongs 17 chains single line) from Priest's Bridge along Upper Richmond Road, to a point opposite Roehampton Lane. The only widenings in this Borough proposed by the Bill were on the southern side of Upper Richmond Road for about 56 yards from the east side of the Borough Boundary, and on the northern side of Upper Richmond5 Road from the north-west side of Priest's Bridge to the western boundary of Vine Cottage. The Bill proposed to authorise the 45 company in or under the surface of any streets or public placesin which the tramways will be situate or in which it may be necessary or desirable to do so in order to connect the tramways with any generating- station, to construct, lay down, erect, maintain, renew and repair electric wires, conductors, posts, studs, tubes, boxes and other electrical apparatus for the purpose of connecting any portions of the tramways with any generating stations, engines, machinery, or apparatus; or any other purpose of the BilL 56. This Council was of opinion that a double line of tramways should be constructed, and the road widened to not less than 54 feet throughout; that the plans of the proposed mode of construction and making of crossovers should be approved by them as well as by the Board of Trade; that the provisions of the Bill which would authorise the company to lay down or erect wires and other electrical apparatus in streets should be objected to; that the paving of the carriageways outside the tramway rails, where interfered with, should be carried out at the cest of the company ; that the Bill should be amended so as to give the road authority powers to prevent an overhead system, and powers respecting other systems of traction; that the proposed substitution of sixty years for twenty-one years as the period after which the tramways might be purchased should be objected to, and that the Bill required amendment in other respects. 57. A Petition was accordingly presented to the House of Commons against the Bill. The promoters intimated that they did not propose to proceed with the Bill so far as it related to the proposed tramways in this Borough, and agreed to a modification of the Clause relating to the erection in or under streets, of posts, wires, or other electrical apparatus. The Bill was withdrawn on the 24th June, 1908. Croydon and Southern District Tramways. 58. This Bill proposed to authorise a company to construct tramways from the existing terminus of the Croydon Corporation Tramways at Purley to Smithambottom, Godstone, and Whyteleafe, in the County of Surrey. 59. The only Clauses in the Bill which affected this Borough were those which would authorise the Company to place posts, boxes, wires, and other electrical apparatus in or under the 46 face of any streets or roads in which it may be necessary or desirable to do so in order to connect the tramways with any generating station, and a Clause which would authorise the company to make agreements with any other company, body, or persons, for the supply of energy to or from the company, and would authorise the laying down of electric lines, etc., from any generating station from or to the tramways across or along any road or street. The promoters agreed to a modification of these Clauses, but the Bill was withdrawn in June, 1908. London and District Electricity Supply, and the London Electric Supply. 60. The first of these Bills proposes to authorise a company, with a capital of £4,500,000, to construct generating stations and works and to supply electrical and the London energy within the area of supply defined in the Bill, County of London and parts of Essex, Kent, Surrey, and Middlesex. The Bill provides that the powers of the company for the supply of energy shall be subject to the provision that energy shall be supplied only to authorised undertakers and to persons requiring a supply for power. 61. The London Electric Supply Bill is promoted by fourteen companies (including the County of London Electric Supply Company, who are supplying electricity in this Borough), and the preamble states that such companies have spent on their undertakings a sum of ;£13,000,000, and that they are now precluded from associating themselves with any other company. 62. The Bill proposed to authorise the formation of a Joint Committee, consisting of representatives of such of the companies as choose to join, and two Members of the London County Council, and would authorise the transfer to the Joint Committee of generating stations and works of London Electric Supply Companies. 63. Clause 42 sets out the maximum price for the supply of electrical energy, and provides for a revision of the charges after the expiration of seven years. This Council presented petitions against both of the abovementioned Bills, but decided not to appear before the Parliamentary Committee in opposition. The Bills have been read a third time in the House of Lords and will be considered by a Committee of the House of Commons in the Autumn Session. 47 64. This Bill provides for the establishment of a Port Authoport of rity, to consist of a Chairman and Vice-Chairman, London. fourteen members elected by payers of dues, owners of river craft, and wharfingers, and ten members appointed as follows :—five by the London County Council, two by the Board of Trade, and one by the Admiralty, the Corporation of London, and Trinity House respectively; that the Port Authority shall have charge of the River Thames from Teddington to Havengore Creek, fifty-one miles below London Bridge; that the Port Authority shall take over the property, powers and obligations of the London and India Docks Company, the Millwall Dock Company, the Thames Conservancy below Teddington, and the Watermen's Company so far as relates to the River, and that the Board of Trade should have power to make orders, authorising the Port Authority to construct new works, purchase lands compulsorily, and to co-operate with others with a view to providing further accommodation and facilities in the Port. Provision is made for the re-constitution of the Conservators who will control the River above Teddington by the appointment of seventeen members, one appointed by each of the following, viz.:—the Board of Trade, the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Water Board, the London County Council, the Gloucestershire and Wiltshire County Councils, the Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Surrey, and Middlesex County Councils, the Borough Councils of Abingdon and Wallingford, the Borough Councils of Reading, Kingston-upon-Thames, Windsor, Henlev-upon-Thames, and Maidenhead. 65. This Council was of opinion that in view of the large sum contributed to the Conservancy Funds by the Metropolitan Water Board and the importance of seeing that the waters of the upper river are preserved from pollution, that the Board of Trade, the Port Authority, the Metropolitan Water Board, and the London County Council should each have two representatives instead of one on the re-constituted Body of Conservators. 66. 1 he Council also appointed Alderman Bulcraig and Councillor Taylor its representatives to attend a Conference convened by the Hammersmith Borough Council at which representatives of the Riparian Authorities of Fulham, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Brentford, Heston and Isleworth, Barnes, and Wandsworth were present, and the following resolutions passed, viz. : — 48 1. That, having regard to the present highly unsatisfactory state of the River Thames between Richmond and Wandsworth at low water tides, caused by the lowering of the surface level of the river, this Conferenceviews with alarm the proposal, which is understands will be included in the Port of London Bill for the deepening of the river below London Bridge, as it would probably cause a further lowering of the water levels between the points above referred to, and would not only seriously interfere with the traffic of the river, but intensify the unpleasantness at the present time experienced from the wide stretches of may banks at low tide. 2. That representations to this effect be made to the President of the Board of Trade, and that he be urged to make provision in the Port of London Bill for protecting the interests of those districts represented at this Conference, by the construction of a lock and weir in an approved position, or by such other efficient means as may be found advisable. 3. That in the opinion of this Conference the advice of an expert engineer should be obtained (a) as to the probable effect upon the water levels of the river below Richmond of carrying out a scheme of deepening, below London Bridge as suggested, and (ft) as to the advisability of constructing a half tidal lock below Wandsworth, as suggested in the Report made by Mr. Pritchard, M.I.C.E., to the Conference of Riparian Authoritiesin 1897. 4. That several eminent engineers be invited to state the terms on which they would be prepared to advise the Conference on the points mentioned. 5. That the several Authorities represented at this Conference be informed of the resolutions passed, and asked whether they are prepared tocontribute, on the basis of rateable value, to the cost of obtaining the expert advice referred to. 67. The Council presented a petition to the House of Commons based upon the foregoing resolutions (1) and (2), and appointed Alderman Bulcraig and Councillor Taylor its representatives on the proposed deputation to the Minister in charge of the Bill. 68. The deputation waited upon Sir Hudson Kearley, M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, on the 26th June, when Sir Hudson Kearley promised to consider whether anything could be done with respect to the damage which it was suggested would be caused to the upper reaches of the river, though he thought the Body to appeal to would be the new Port Authority. With regard to the direct representation of Riparian Authorities on that Body (which the deputation also suggested), Sir Hudson Kearley could hold out no hope of the adoption of the suggestion. 49 69. The Joint Committee of the House of Lords and House of Commons, to whom the Bill was referred, agreed to the insertion of a clause for the protection of Riparian Authorities with respect to the effect of dredging by the new Port Authority. 70. This Bill is similar to one which has been introduced. Polling under the same title in several recent years, which Arrangment Parliamentary proposed to transfer from the Justices to the Boroughs). County Council the power to divide Parliamentary Boroughs into Polling Districts. The County Council has already the power with regard to Polling Districts for County Council Elections, and this Council being of opinion that the division of Polling Districts of Parliamentary Boroughs and County Council, areas should be in the hands of one authority, petitioned in favour of the Bill which passed and received Royal Assent on the 1st August, 1908. 71. A similar Bill to this has also been introduced during Polling District (County Counoils). several recent Sessions, and would authorise the County Council to exercise their powers for dividing Electoral Divisions into Polling Districts from. time to time and as often as they think fit, and also to alter Polling Districts. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill,, which also received the Royal Assent on the 1st August. 72. The subject of combined drainage continues to receive Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. the attention of the Metropolitan Borough Councils,, and, in November last, this Council considered and approved a draft Bill to amend the law on the subject adopted by a Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, and Sir Henry Kimber, Bart., M.P., consented to back the Bill. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill, which is at present waiting the second reading in the House of Commons. •71. This Bill proposed to authorise the Countv Council to Education Board. Provisional Order Confirmation (London No.1). purchase sites for educational purposes, including a site for a school at Merton Road, Wandsworth,, across which there is at present a public footpath. The Bill provided that nothing therein contained should authorise the County Council to extinguish any public rights of way without the usual Order of Quarter Sessions. The Council presented: 50 a petition both to the House of Lords and the House of Commons against any alteration in the Bill. The Bill was passed without amendment and received Royal Assent on the and August, 1907. 74. This Bill proposed to authorise the Common Council of Municipal the City of London, Metropolitan Borough Councils, Milk Depots.and the Council of any Municipal Borough or Urban District with a population of 50,000 or more, to establish and maintain depots for the sale of milk specially prepared for consumption by infants, to purchase and prepare milk, and provide such laboratories, plant, and other things, and to exercise such powers and duties as may be necessary for the purpose. This Council presented a petition against the Bill, which did not reach second reading. 75. This Bill provided that at every election of a County Councillor for the County of London, and at every London Muni- , cipal Elections election of a Borough Councillor, the poll should be (Hours of Poll). from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. This Council presented a petition against the Bill, which was not proceeded with. 76. This Bill was introduced in the Session of 1907, and proPublic Health vided that a person should not be appointed a Officers. Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector unless he was qualified in the manner prescribed by the Bill, and that Medical Officers of Health or Sanitary Inspectors should not be appointed for a limited period, and should be removable only subject to an appeal to the Local Government Board. The Council presented a petition against the measure. The Bill was not proceeded with, and a Bill to the same effect has been introduced in the present Session against which the Council also presented a petition. This Bill was also dropped. Similar provisions as to the qualifications of Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors are already in force in London. 77. In the last annual report it was stated that on this Bill Butter and coming before the House of Commons a new clause Margarine. was jnserted extending the powers contained in the Margarine Act, 1887, so as to enable Inspectors of Weights and Measures to take samples of Margarine, and that this Council, deeming it inexpedient that such powers should be conferred on Inspectors of Weights and Measures, petitioned the House of 51 Lords to strike out the clause. The clause was subsequently amended by excepting the County of London from its provisions. As amended, the Bill received the Royal Assent on the 21st August, 1907. 78. This Bill provided for the earlier notification of births,. Notification of Births. and the sending to the Medical Officer to Health of a notice within thirty-six hours after the birth of a child, and for the Medical Officer ot Health to send weekly to the London County Council a list of all notices received by him during the week. The Bill also provided that the Local Government Board might by order declare that the Act shall be enforced in the area of a Local Authority, although it had not been adopted by such authority. The Council whilst approving of an acceleration in the registration of births was of opinion that this object could be attained more effectually by shortening the period (six weeks) now allowed for such registration than by the scheme proposed by the Bill, which would duplicate the work at considerable expense. A petition was therefore presented against the Bill which was, however, passed, and received Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. 79. At a special Meeting of the Council on the 6th November, convened to consider as to adopting the Act, a motion that the Act be adopted for the Borough was not carried. 80. This Bill is designed to abolish plural voting at Parlia- Elcctions and Registration. mentary Elections in London, by providing that the County of London shall be one Parliamentary Borough, and that every Parliamentary Borough or division of a Parliamentary Borough within the County shall be a division of the Parliamentary Borough of London ; it also provides that the Clerk of the London County Council shall be the returning officer for the whole of the County. This Council presented a petition against the Bill on the ground that the enquiries contemplated by Clause 2 of the Bill would cause enormous expense, and would not result in more correct or more complete registers of electors being made than are at present made; that the time allowed for such enquiries and preparation of the lists of electors is insufficient, and the fines to which Town Clerks would be liable are, under the circumstances unreasonable; that before any alterations are made in the law relating to the registration of electors the question of 52 who is to be regarded as an inhabitant householder and who is a lodger should be authoritatively settled ; that the most suitable person to be Returning Officer is the Town Clerk, who prepares the lists of electors and has local knowledge; that the proposal to •extend the hours of poll to 10 o'clock in the afternoon is uncalled for and inexpedient, and that in the opinion of the Council the most urgent Electoral Reform is a measure for the redistribution of Seats. The Bill has not yet been read a second time. 81. The Bill would substitute 100 years for 80 years as the Housing of the maximum term for which money may be borrowed W orkin g Classes for the purpose of the Housing of the Working Classes Act; would limit the rate of interest to be charged by the Public Works Loans Commissioners for loans for the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Act to two per cent, per annum would require owners of land to declare the selling values of their holdings and authorise a special rate on an annual value of four per cent, of the capital value so declared; and would authorise the rating of unoccupied premises, and the establishment of a fair rent court. This Council presented a petition against the Bill, which is awaiting Second Reading. 82. The Bill provides that on-licences shall be reduced in Licensing. accordance with the first schedule; that at the expiration of fourteen years compensation shall cease to be payable in respect of any licences extinguished, and that any application for a re-grant of an on-licence after that period shall be treated as an application for a new licence and not as an application for renewal. The Bill would also amend the law with regard to the sale of liquors on Sundays, and as to registration of clubs. This Council also presented a petition against this Bill, which was read a second time on the 4th May. 83. This Bill was introduced by the President of the Local London Paving Government Board. Its object is to secure uniforExpenses mity of treatment with respect to paving charges in the case of all churches, chapels, or other buildings appropriated for public religious worship. At present churches belonging to the Church of England are exempt from such charges, whilst other places of worship are not so exempt. This Council approved of the principle of uniform treatment in respect of paving charges, but communicated to the Government its opinion that such 53 uniformity would best be attained by making all places of worship and the authorities in whom public open spaces are vested liable for such charges and that the same treatment should be extended to expenses of repairing roads under the Metropolis Management Act, 1890, and expenses of flagging footpaths under the Metropolis Management Act, 1862, Amendment Act, 1890, in addition to expenses of paving new streets under the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 and 1862. This Bill is awaiting second reading. 84. This Bill would require the registration of movable dwellMoveable ings, such as tents, vans, etc., used for purposes of Dwellings. abode, and would empower the Local Government Board to make regulations for the purposes of promoting cleanliness and of preventing nuisances, and the Board of Education regulations with respect to school attendance. The Council presented a petition in favour of the Bill, which has been read a second time in the House of Lords. 85. This Bill proposes to repeal any limitation in any Act of Public Parliament of the expense or rate to be levied by a Libraries. library authority; would enable County Councils to adopt the Libraries Acts (exempting districts already rated for library purposes from any library rate levied by a County 'Council); would exempt public libraries and other buildings provided under the Libraries Acts from rates, and would authorise library authorities to expend out of the library rate such money as they deem fit for the provision of lectures or exhibits. The Council presented a petition against the Bill, which was not read :a second time. 86. No action was taken with regard to the other Bills aboveTnentioned. 87. The Council record with much regret the death of Mr. farvis Maples, who was for many years a Obituary. representative of Putney on the Wandsworth District Board and on the Council, and of Mr. William Dickinson, formerly Alderman of the Borough and a Member of the late Wandsworth District Board for the parish of Streatham. 88. A second National Conference on Infantile Mortality was Conference, in- held in March, 1908. The Chairman of the Public fantile Mortality. Health Committee (Councillor Anderson), Alderman 54 Robinson, and the Medical Officer of Health, were appointed this. Council's representatives. The following- resolutions were passed,, viz. :— (1) That this Conference expresses its appreciation of Parliamenthaving passed the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and urges upon all Local Authorities the importance of adopting the Act and appointingqualified women to carry out its provisions. (2) That, in order to combat the prevalent ignorance resulting in wastage of infant life and injury to the health of many survivors, the Conference urges upon the Board of Education, and upon Educational Authorities generally, the importance of securing to all girls in every gradeof school a satisfactory training in domestic and personal hygiene and the duties of womanhood. (3) That the Conference welcomes most gladly the Children's BillK introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., for the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and recommends the Executive Committee to ask that the Bill be specially amended to include the case in which one child only is put out to nurse for reward ; and that the Bill be further amended to empower Local Authorities to. charge upon the rates the cost of carrying out the existing statutory provisions for the prevention of cruelty to children. (4) That the Conference, being convinced of the injury done to infant life and health through infants being taken into public-houses, urges upon Parliament the necessity of providing such legislation as will prevent this. (5) That this Conference urges upon Boards of Guardians the advisability of making greater use of their existing powers to adopt, under the Poor Law Act, 1899, the children of incorrigible parents. (6) That all preparations offered or sold as food or drugs for infants, should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. (7) That, in view of the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, the Conference, being of opinion that immediate amendment of the law is desirable, urges upon Parliament the necessity of at once taking such steps as are necessary to effect this. (8) That the Conference re-affirm the resolution of the former Conference, that the Midwives Act, 1902, be extended to Scotland and Ireland. (9) That the Conference continue as a Committee to give effect to the foregoing resolutions, with power to remit to an Executive Committee to. carry out the same. 89. A Conference was convened by the Paddington Borough Conference, Council to discuss the question of taking measures Pulmonary .... Tuberculosis. to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption), and Alderman Robinson, Councillor Blunt, and the 55 Medical Officer of Health, were appointed the Council's representatives. The following- resolutions were passed, viz. :— (a) That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) should be compulsory. (b) That application be made to the Local Government Board for arc Order to be made— (1) To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1901, and (2) To extend the provisions of the following sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption)— Section 60—Cleansing and disinfection of premises, &c. „ 61—Disinfection of bedding, &c. „ 62—Infectious rubbish thrown into ashpits, &c., to be disinfected. „ 63—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging. „ 64—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements as to infectious disease. ,, 65—Penalty on ceasing to occupy houses without disinfection or notice to owner, or making false answer. (c) That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable in order to limit the spread of tuberculosis, that provision should be made for public inspection and control, at its several sources, of the milk supply of England, and that the Local Government Board be asked to take steps to secure the efficient administration of the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885, and Orders amending the same, by making compulsory regulations.

(h) That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation from the Conference in support of the above resolutions, and that he be urged to take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to them. 90. The subject of the provision of a new Mortuary and a Coroner's Court for Wandsworth has been further Mortuary and considered, plans for a Mortuary on a site in Ram Square, adjoining the Town Hall, were prepared, but it was found impossible to provide a satisfactory building owing to the insufficient area available for the purpose. The Public Health Committee have now under consideration plans for the erection of a Mortuary and Coroner's Court on part of the land which was acquired for the cemetery in Magdalen Road, adjoining Earlsfield Station. 91. The Council was represented at a Conference convened by the Garden City Association on the subject of Town Town Planning. Planning, by Alderman Robinson and Councillor Blunt. 92. Other information relating to public health is contained in the Medical Officer's Report, Appendix L. 93. The Council was informed in reply to its protest against Secondary the election of Secondary School at West Hill, Schools and Wandsworth, referred to in last year's annual Training ' J College. report (p. 62), that, in view of the fact that the purchase had been completed and the preliminary plans approved, the County Council regretted it was too late to alter its decision 57 in the matter. The County Council pointed out that while they would be pleased to consider suggestions of Borough Councils as to sites for Secondary Schools, they were under no obligation to consult such Councils, as was the case with regard to Public Elementary Schools. 94. A resolution was passed by the Council in favour of the London County increase in the number of Members of the EducaEducation tion Committee of the London County Council by Committee. the co-option of a nominee of each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, in order to meet the demands of the work of such Committee, and the Council's views were communicated to the Board of Education, the London County Council, the City and Borough Councils, and the local Members of the London County Council. 95. The County Council has given notice of an amended scheme relating to the constitution of its Education Committee, providing for the appointment of thirty-eight Members of the London County Council, and twelve other persons (five being women) selected by such Council. The old Committee comprised fortythree persons, thirty-eight being Members of the County Council, and five women selected by that Council. 96. The Council has had before it resolutions passed at Powers and Conferences at Kensington and Hammersmith Duties of Managers. between Committees of such Councils and Managers of Schools in the Boroughs on the subject of the powers and duties of Managers. The views of the Council with respect to the resolutions were communicated to the Conferences and the London County Council. The County Council has now issued a series of regulations for Managers of Public Elementary Council Schools. 97. The period for which this Council's Managers of Public Managers Elementary Schools in the Borough were appointed expired in December, 1907, and new Managers have been appointed for three years from that date. The Council has issued a list of Managers of Public Elementary Schools in the Borough. 58 98. This subject has received the consideration of the Council,. Teaching of who expressed the opinion that the distress caused Trades. by the want of employment would be alleviated if a portion of the moneys now raised for educational purposes were devoted to the teaching of trades, and in particular by making grants of money, as scholarships, to be spent in subsidising, through the employers, small weekly wages or as premiums on the apprenticeship of those successful condidates wishing to learn a trade. The Council's views were communicated to the London County Council and the Borough Councils; and the County Council replied that the whole question of the award of scholarships to apprentices engaged in trades was under consideration. Six of the Borough Councils were in agreement with this Council's views, and five agreed in part with the resolution. 99. Several draft schemes made by the Board of Education Schemes re relating to Non-provided Schools in the Borough Non-provided . ........ Schools. have been submitted to the Council tor its mation. The schemes provided for the improvement of school buildings, appointment of Trustees, sale of buildings, etc. One of the schemes (St. Mary's School, Summerstown) provides for the appointment of one of the Trustees by this Council. This scheme has not yet, however, been finally settled. 100. Alderman Hewett has been re-appointed as this Council's Metropolitan representative on the Metropolitan Paving ComCommittee- mittee. 101. The Council has again had under consideration the subMetropolitan jeet of the suggested establishment of a MetroTraffic Board. politan Traffic Board. The Council last year asked the Government to promote a bill in Parliament to give effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission on London Traffic, 1906, for the formation of a Traffic Board for London, consisting of not more than five and not less than three members, preferably the latter, and was represented by Councillor Walker on a deputation to the London County Council in favour of this proposal. The County Council concurred in the view of this Council and of the deputation on this subject, and decided to arrange for a deputation to wait upon the Prime Minister to urge the necessity of H.M. Government securing the immediate establishment of a London 59 Traffic Board upon the lines indicated in the report of the Royal Commission. The Council has recently again had the proposal under consideration in connection with a resolution passed by the Paddington Borough Council asking the London County Council to take steps to promote the appointment of the proposed Traffic Board, and decided to support the action of the Paddington Borough Council in the matter. 102. A Conference of representatives of City and Borough Councils was convened by the Hammersmith Motor Traffic. Borough Council in March last, on the subject of motor traffic in London, but this Council did not take part in it. The subject was further considered in June last, in connection with a letter from the Highways Protection League, and the following resolution was passed by the Council and a copy forwarded to the Home Secretary and to the Commissioner of Police, viz. :— That this Council is of opinion that, owing to the increasing number of accidents caused by motor traffic in the County of London, the maximum speed of all motor vehicles should bo reduced to, at most, 12 miles an hour ; and, owing to the serious annoyance and discomfort caused by excessive noise, vibration, etc., the police should be granted enlarged powers to control this class of traffic. 103. A letter has since been received from the Poplar Borough Council, calling attention to the excessive speed at which motors are driven in the metropolis, and to the accidents which have already occurred, expressing the opinion that combined action should be taken by the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and inviting the Council to appoint three delegates to attend a Conference to consider the question. The Council appointed Alderman Robinson and Councillors Taylor and Sir Frederick Lance as its representatives. The proposed Conference has not yet been held. 104. During recent years numerous applications have been Telephone received from the Post Office Authorities for permission to carry wires, mostly for telephone purposes, along streets in this Borough. The Council has so far made it a practice to require these wires to be laid underground, except in special cases. In several instances which occurred during the past year, however, the Post Office Authorities did not see their way to place the wires underground nor, where overhead lines were agreed to by the Council, to use iron poles. Previously, 60 in the cases where overhead lines were sanctioned, the Council usually made it a condition that the poles should be of iron in accordance with an award made by the Railway Commissioners in 1884, after proceedings had been taken with respect to some proposed wires in this district. The Post Office Authorities pointed out that circumstances had changed considerably since that date, that the adoption of the Council's requirements would be attended by financial loss, and that in recent appeals to the Courts with regard to overhead lines in other localities the PostmasterGeneral had been successful. The Council was also pressed by residents in the Borough, who were requiring the telephone service, to agree terms with the Post Office. After conferences between representatives of the Postmaster-General and of this Council on the subject, it was agreed not to object to the proposed overhead lines, subject to the following conditions, viz. :— (1) That the poles in Kersfield Road, Davlesford Avenue, and Gladwyn Road, Putney ; Elsenham Street, Kingscliffe Gardens, and Princes Road, Southfield ; Brenda Road and Langroyd Road, Balham, be of creosoted wood, the lower part of the pole to be lagged with painted wooden laths, and the poles to be similar in every respect to the sample pole erected opposite the Council House. (2) That the poles in Schubert Road and Gressenhall Road, Southfield, be of iron. (3) That the proposed overhead lines be so erected that no part of any wire across any road or footway shall be at any time at a less height than 25 feet above such road or footway. (4) That the poles be placed not less than 60 yards and not more than 90 yards apart, in such positions as may be approved by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and the works carried out to his satisfaction. (5) That where the poles are erected in parish roads under the care of the Council the Post Office Authorities pay the cost of reinstating the public way upon the scale of prices agreed to in the letters from the Postmaster-General, dated 9th May, 1903, and 4th April, 1908. (6) That not more than twenty-four wires be placed on any one pole, and that in the event of wires in excess of that number being required, the Postmaster-General shall, subject to the consent of the Council, construct an underground line along that portion of the route on which such greater number is required, in lieu of the corresponding portion of the overhead route hereby authorised, and shall, without prejudice to the question whether such poles and wires, or any of them, should be retained or re-erected for telephone distribution purposes, remove all such poles and wires 61 105. The Highways Committee have had under consideration the subject of the sufficiency of the Fund estabWoodpaving, . , & Short Loans) lished in 1904 to meet expenditure for woodpaving Fund- . , and other short-lived works. Since its ment the produce of a rate of 1½d. in the £ has been set apart each year for the purposes of the Fund. This provision, however, has been found to be inadequate in view of the new works required to be executed and the necessity for making provision for renewing the existing woodpaving as it wears out. The Committee accordingly suggested that the Fund should be augmented by carrying to its credit annually the produce of a rate of l½d. in lieu of l½d. in the The Finance Committee concurred in this suggestion, which was adopted by the Council in December last. The London County Council does not now grant loans for repaving existing woodpaved roads, and as the area of the roads so paved is rapidly increasing in this Borough it is advisable that the Fund should be a substantial one in order to meet the large expenditure for works of this description which it may be necessary to carry out during the next few years. By defraying the cost of these paving works out of the Fund a considerable saving of interest is effected, as compared with the former practice. 106. The proposed widening of Lower Richmond Road, Lower Rich- Putney, is still in abeyance, owing to difficulties mond Road which have arisen with regard to the acquisition of Widening and certain property required for the improvement. Wood Paving The subject of the desirability of wood paving the carriageway of the road has continued to receive the attention of the Council. As mentioned in last year's report the Borough Council, before definitely settling the question of paving, communicated with the London County Council with the view of ascertaining whether that Council proposed to formulate a scheme for the provision of tramways along the road. The County Council stated in reply that there was no such proposal before it at the time. The alterations to the approach to Putney Bridge, required' for the construction of the authorised tramways from Hammersmith to Putney, have been completed, and the part of Lower Richmond Road affected has been repaved with wood. The Wood Paving, &c. (Short Loans) Fund having been augmented as mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this report, the Borough Council has been able to make arrangements for continuing this 62 wood paving as far as Festing Road, the kerb being relaid and the footpaths made good where necessary. A contract was entered into on the 29th July, 1908, for carrying out the work, which is now in progress. 107. The licence of the Coopers' Arms public-house at the Widening at corner of High Street, Putney, and Lacy Road, Corner of High street Putney having been extinguished, the owners (who were and Lacy Roadalso the owners the adjoining shops Nos. 74 and 76, High Street) proposed to pull down the old buildings and erect modern business premises on the site. As the entrance to Lacy Road from High Street is very narrow and the traffic there is considerable, the Borough Council took advantage of the opportunity of securing a widening of the public way, and came to an arrangement with the owners for the purchase of the land required to make Lacy Road 40 feet wide and High Street not less than 54 feet wide where the site abuts on those roads. The improvement, which is estimated to cost .£2,775, including paving works, will be carried out as soon as the purchase of the property is completed. The London County Council agreed to contribute one-half the net cost of the widening in High Street, the total contribution to be limited to the sum of £400, and expressed the opinion that the widening of Lacy Road would not afford sufficient facilities to the general through traffic to justify a contribution towards the cost out of the County Fund. 108. The widening of the public-way at the corner of Upper Richmond Road and Putney Hill in connection Whening at Richmond Road corner of Upper with the erection of a new bank there has been and putney Hill completed. The estimated cost of the improvement was £4,690, without taking credit for the surplus land. The actual cost as against this estimate was £4,641 10s. 8d., and the Council has in hand the surplus land at No. 8, Putney Hill. The London County Council contributed the sum of £1,438 12s. 2d. towards the cost of the improvement. 109. The subject of the proposed reconstruction for electric traction of the tramways in Wandsworth Road, Wandsworth Road and .East Clapham, and East Hill, Wandsworth, and the Hill Tramways widening of those roads in connection therewith has continued to receive the consideration of the Borough Council. The Conference between Members of the London County Council and the Borough Council, referred to in last year's report, took 63 place in October last, when The Mayor (Councillor Wise), Aldermen Lorden, and Parker, and Councillor Dawnay attended as representatives of the Borough Council. 110. As a result of the interview the Borough Council in November last submitted to the County Council a modified scheme of widenings sufficient, together with the narrowing of the footpaths in certain parts of the thoroughfare, to allow of a double line of tramways being laid throughout in lieu of one of the lines being carried along side roads as originally proposed by the County Council. The Borough Council also suggested that where necessary the carriageway (except between the tramways rails where the road will be paved with granite setts) should be repaved with wood and the footpaths with artificial stone and granite kerb. Subject to these proposals being accepted by the County Council the Borough Council offered to contribute one-third of the cost of the property required for the widening, to relieve the County Council of its liability to maintain any portion of the carriageway, except the part between the rails and margins 18 inches in width, outside the rails in consideration of the County Council repaving certain parts of the road free of expense to the Borough Council, and to defray one-third of the cost of the remainder of the paving works. The estimated amount of the suggested contribution by the Borough Council towards the cost of the proposed widening and the paving works is £9,273. The County Council subsequently suggested that the Borough Council should undertake the acquisition of the property required for the widenings, and the Borough Council in April last expressed its willingness to do so, subject to the County Council concurring in the above-mentioned proposals. 111. The matter has since been under the consideration of the Improvements and Highways Committees of the County Council, and certain of the proposals have been accepted by that Council. 112. The County Council are taking steps with the view of the work of reconstructing the tramways being put in hand very shortly. 113. The County Council is also taking the necessary steps Queen's Road for the electrification of the tramway from WandsTrama ways. worth Road via Queen's Road to Chelsea Bridge, a 64 small portion of which is in this Borough. The tramway will be reconstructed on the underground conduit system of electric traction and it is anticipated that the work will be put in hand very shortly. 114. The question of the proposed construction of a line of Mitcham Lane tramways along Mitcham Lane, Streatham, has Tramways. continued to receive attention. The Borough Council having settled terms for including in the London County Council (Tramways and Improvements) Bill for 1908 the extension of the existing tramways at Streatham, along Streatham High Road to the County boundary at Norbury, has been in communication with the London County Council with the view of that Council obtaining, as soon as possible, Parliamentary powers to construct the suggested tramways along Mitcham Lane. In reply the Borough Council was informed that the Highways Committee of the County Council had given careful consideration to the question of seeking Parliamentary authority in connection with the construction of tramways from Streatham High Road via Mitcham Lane to the county boundary and thence via Southcroft Road to Mitcham Road ; that in view of the somewhat extensive street widenings which would be required in order to provide a satisfactory route for the tramways and that the tramways would for a considerable distance pass through a district that was at the time in a very undeveloped condition, the Committee could not see their way to recommend the Council to seek Parliamentary authority in respect of the suggested tramway in the Session of 1909, and that further consideration would be given to the proposal at a later date. 115. The County Council has been asked to reconsider the matter and to seek power in the Session of 1909 to construct the part of the proposed tramways from Streatham High Road via Mitcham Lane to the County boundary at Roe Bridge. 116. The Committee who have the matter in hand have been York Road proceeding with the negotiations for the acquisiwidening. tion of property required for the widening of York Road, Wandsworth, in connection with the construction of the tramways there for electric traction. Several more claims have been settled and the land to be added to the public way will bi paved as soon as the purchases are completed. 65 117- The work of constructing the electric tramways in Mitcham Ro«d Mitcham Road and Tooting High Street (late and Tooting High Street Tramways Merton Road), referred to in last year's report, having been completed and the paving works executed, the tramways were inspected by the Board of Trade and opened for traffic in October last. 118. Nearly all the property required for the widening of Mitcham Road in connection with the construction of the new tramways has been acquired, and the land thrown into the public way paved. Negotiations for the purchase of the remaining land are now in progress. 119. After considerable negotiation an agreement was arrived Footbridge over at with regard to the amount of the compensation River wandie to be Paid to the owner for the small piece of land River Wandle Paper McMurray's required for the western abutment of the new footbridge proposed to be constructed over the River Wandle in place of the existing bridge on the western side of McMurray's paper mills and for straightening the footpath leading from Garratt Lane to Merton Road. The purchase of the land has been completed, and the Council has arranged for the work of constructing the new bridge to be put in hand as soon as possible. . The London County Council having declined to consider Putney Bridge the Borough Council's applications for contribuRoad Widening. tions towards the cost of widening certain parts of Putney Bridge Road until a complete scheme for the improvement of the road had been submitted, the Borough Council in April last forwarded to the County Council a plan showing the widenings which the Borough Council suggested should be carried out if at some future time the County Council deemed it necessary to widen the road in connection with the construction of a line of tramways from Wandsworth to Putney, and stated that the Borough Council did not propose to carry out any further widenings at present. The County Council has since asked for an estimate of the cost of the widenings shown on the above-mentioned plan and steps are being taken for this to be prepared. 121. For some years past the Borough Council has been in Tooting Bee communication with the London County Council Road Widening.with the view of arranging for the widening of the 66 part of Tooting Bee Road across Tooting Common between The Avenue and the railway bridge. The part of the road in question is very narrow, there are no proper footpaths and the ditches bordering the road render it dangerous to traffic. Objection having been taken by users of the horse ride on the Common adjoining the road and others to the scheme put forward some time ago, an amended proposal was prepared for filling in the ditches on both sides of the part of the road in question, forming a footpath on the northern side adjoining the horse ride, and providing a carriageway 33 feet in width, a post and rail fence to be fixed but no footpath formed on the southern side of the road, as there is already one running parallel with the road on that side with only a narrow strip of the Common intervening. It is proposed that the work should be carried out in conjunction with the Central (Unemployed) Body for London during next winter, the Central Body providing the labour and the Borough Council the materials. The total estimated cost is £2,140. 122. In response to previous applications the County Council declined to surrender any part of the Common for the purpose of the improvement, and the Borough Council, in January last, asked the County Council to meet a deputation from the Borough Council on the ground to discuss the matter. The Conference took place on the 23rd May last, the Borough Council being represented by the Members of the Improvements Sub-Committee of the Highways Committee. The amended proposal was explained by the Sub-Committee and the matter is now under the consideration of the London County Council. 123. At the same time an application was made by the Borough Council for permission to round off the Common at the western corner of Tooting Bee Road and Garrads Road. The County Council has agreed to this proposal and the work will be carried out as soon as the necessary arrangements have been made. 124.

The total nett Board Widening of the first scheme was £,,970 os. 11d., towards which the London County Council contributed the sum of £492 10s. 3d. The estimated cost of this improvement was £2,364. The total nett cost of the second widening was 67 £2,918 19s. id. The estimated cost was £3,000. The County Council declined to make a contribution towards the cost of the second improvement. 125.

The widening of Merton Road, Southfield, to 60 feet in Merton Road front of the "West Hill" London County Council Widening of school has been completed. The total nett cost of "West Hill" School the improvement was £799 4s. id., towards which the County Council contributed the sum of £145 in respect of the paving works for which such Council would have been liable had the road been widened to 40 feet only. The estimated cost of the improvement was £694. 127. The widening of Streatham Place at the corner of Brix- stireatham Place ton Hill, arranged some time ago, has been cornImprovement. 'pleted at a total cost of £1,935 195. 4d. The total estimated cost was £2,000. 128. The Highways Committee have continued the negotiaHigh Street tions for the acquisition of the property required Clapham, ' for widening High Street, Clapham, at Nos. 84 to Widening 96, and have settled the majority of the claims. In one case it was necessary to put in force the Council's compulsory powers as the owner declined the Committee's terms. Similar steps are now being taken with regard to the remaining interest to be acquired. 129. The London County Council having acquired a site for Charlwood Road a school at the corner of Charlwood Road and HotWidening. ham Road Putney, the Borough Council in October last asked the County Council, when arranging for building the school, to make provision for the widening of Charlwood Road to not less than 40 feet. In reply the County Council stated that, provided the Borough Council paid the sum of £765 (the pro rata cost of the strip of land required) and also defrayed the charges for paving and maintaining the land, the Committee of the County Council would be willing to take the necessary steps to. 68 recommend that Council to agree to the proposed surrender of land. These terms were carefully considered by the Borough Council and, the locality having been viewed, the Borough Council in April last suggested that the County Council should give up sufficient land to widen the road 20 feet from the existing centre, and that the Borough Council should purchase the additional strip of land required to make the road 40 feet wide in front of the schools and should also undertake the necessary paving works free of cost to the County Council. This suggestion was adopted by the Education Committee of the County Council and, upon their recommendation, agreed to by the County Council in May last. The County Council has, however, since stated that it was found that the progress made with the buildings would render it impossible to widen the road to 40 feet. 130. The Borough Council regrets that although the attention of the County Council was called to the matter so long ago as October last, arrangements were not made for the building to be so erected that the road could be widened to 40 feet, and that while the Borough Council was negotiating for the acquisition of the necessary land the County Council proceeded to erect the school in such a position as to prevent the negotiations being carried to a satisfactory conclusion and even to prevent the carrying into effect of the resolution passed by the County Council itself in May last agreeing to the Borough Council's proposal. Moreover, from the point of view of convenience to teachers and scholars, it was undesirable that the buildings should be erected so near the public highway, as the noise of the traffic will considerably interfere with the education of the children. The question of the extent to which the road can be widened is still under consideration. 131. The Council a short time ago acquired certain pieces of land, containing 3 acres, 1 rood, 17 poles, at Gar- Garratt Park. ratt Lane, Wandsworth, with the view of the extension of the Garratt Park slop shoot. The cost of the land, including legal and other expenses, was £2,009 12S- 3d. being at the rate of £598 15s. 4d. per acre. Part of the land consisted of building plots abutting upon Burtop Road, Headworth Road, and Maskell Road, and this has been sold. These plots contained 2 roods 7 poles, and realised, after deducting the expenses of the sales, the sum of £1,109 IS- 3d being at the rate of £2,039 69 13s. id. per acre. Of the remainder (2 acres, 3 roods, 10 poles) 25 poles formed part of the sites of the roads above-mentioned, leaving a piece of land containing 2 acres, 2 roods, 25 poles to be added to the slop shoot. The first cost of this land (at the abovementioned rate of £598 15s. 4d. per acre) was £1,590 9s. 6d. The nett cost has been £850 10s. 3d., being at the rate of £320 3s. 1 1d. per acre. 132. Until the land to be added to the shoot is required for the deposit of street refuse it has been added to the recreation ground and was thrown open to the public on the 12th November last. Arrangements have been made for the playing of football, cricket, and other organised games in the extension of the park temporarily by scholars of the County Council schools in the neighbourhood and others. 133.

The attention of the Council was drawn to the formation Private cornPany for the purpose of acquiring about Cemetery. eighty acres of land at Tamworth Lane, Mitcham, to be used as a proprietary cemetery. It appeared that the site was approved by the Home Secretary in 1889 for the purpose of a 71 proprietary cemetery, that such approval still held good, and that the cemetery could be formed without further sanction. The cemetery, if formed, will be within a mile of this Borough, but, under the circumstances, the Council did not see its way to take any action in the matter. 142.

General Report on Testing of Gas supplied to the Wandsworth Borough Council (i) by the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company; (2) by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company, for the year ended 31ST March, 1908. Some changes have occurred in the mode of testing the gas supplied by this Company during the year ended 31st March, 1908. Up to June 30th, 1907, the daily tests were continued as heretofore, but by a resolution of the Council in March, 1907, I was directed to make tests, from July ist onwards, on two days each week at irregular intervals, with an extra test when deemed desirable. This I have done, and the averages of illuminating power and sulphur, given in Table I., are calculated from such tests on and after July ist, 1907. It will be seen from Table I. that the average illuminating power for the year ended 31st March, 1908, was 14.9 candles. This is very slightly higher than the average for the preceding period, 1906-07 (14.7 candles), but lower than the averages for the corresponding periods, 1904-05 and 1905-06, which were i5.2 and 15.5 candles respectively. The illuminating power has, however, been fairly uniform during this last period, that is to say, there has been comparatively little difference in the averages from month to month, although from test to test there was a greater irregularity as will be seen in the curve which I have constructed from the weekly averages (see Table III.). The standard illuminating power of the gas supplied by this Company is 14.0 candles. On no occasion has the gas been below this standard. Since the passing of the Removal of Sulphur Restrictions Act of 1906, no definite limit has been imposed as to the amount of sulphur impurities, other than sulphuretted hydrogen, which might be present in the gas supplied by this Company, although it was generally understood that, in the absence of lime purification, the limit should not appreciably 139 Sulphuretted Hydrogen. Pressure. exceed 35 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas. The former limit imposed was 22 grains during six consecutive days, or 30 grains on any one day. The testing for sulphur impurities, other than sulphuretted hydrogen has, however, been continued, and the average for the year ended 31st March, 1908, was 2.6 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas, with a minimum monthly average of 22.6 grains, and a maximum monthly average of 27.6 grains, while the highest amount of sulphur found in any one test was 33.3 grains on February 16th, 1908. So far, therefore, the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company compares favourably, as regards sulphur impurities, with the averages shown by the Metropolitan Gas Companies during the same period. Owing to the removal of the apparatus for repair during October, 1907, I am unable to furnish an average for that month. A curve, showing weekly averages of sulphur, is given in Table III. There has been no sulphuretted hydrogen found in any of the testings made during the year ended 31st March, 1908. The minimum pressure allowed between sunset and midnight is that of equal to a column of water not less than one inch in height; but the Company have usually employed a pressure of about two inches in past years. During the year ended 31st March, 1908, the pressure has, however, been considerably higher. Although up to June 30th, 1907, it rarely exceeded 3.o inches, there were some records of over 4.5 inches in July, 1907. In August the average was nearly 4.3 inches, with a maximum of 5.6 inches on August 22nd, while in September the average was, 4.2 with a maximum of 5.i inches on September 20th. On October 4th the pressure-gauge registered 5.7 inches. This pressure proved to be too great for the sulphuretted hydrogen apparatus and the gas bubbled through the mercuryseal, rendering further tests impossible for the time being. I at once called ihe attention of the Council to the matter, and the apparatus was removed and reconstructed so as to withstand a sudden rise of pressure, which, however, I am glad to say did not occur again during the remainder of the period ending 31st 140 Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company. Illuminating Power. Sulphuretted Hydrogen. Pressure. March, 1908, the records seldom exceeding 3.0 inches after October, 1907. I wrote later (January 1st, 1908) a general report on the disadvantages of high pressures, which appeared in the Minutes of Council of January 15th, 1908, and copies of which were sent to the Wandsworth and to the Mitcham Gas Companies. I also referred, in this report, to the effect of varying pressures on incandescent mantles, as some complaints in this connection had been received by the Council. There are also some changes to record in connection with the testing of the gas supplied by the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Company. Up to December 31st, 1907, the gas was always tested at the works of the Company at Mitcham but, in accordance with the Mitcham and Wimbledon Gas Act (July 4th), 1907, to which I referred in my report for last year (when the Act was in the Committee stage), the gas is now tested at a testing-place at South Wimbledon, and I commenced testing there on January 2nd, 1908. By the new Act the standard illuminating power is reduced from 15 to 14 candles, the test is made with a bar-photometer, the burner used is known as the Metropolitan Argand No. 2, and the standard light is Harcourt's ten-candle pentane lamp. These new conditions are somewhat favourable to the Gas Company, and the illuminating power has been maintained at a high standard, the average of the fortnightly tests during January, February, and March, 1908, being 16.7, while for the whole year it is 16.1 candles with a minimum of 15.1 candles and a maximum of l7.7 candles. Details of all tests made are given in Table II. There was no sulphuretted hydrogen found at any of the testings during the year ended 31st March, 1908. Sulphur impurities other than sulphuretted hydrogen are not estimated. The pressure has averaged 3'4 inches with a minimum of 3.2 inches and a maximum of 4.6 inches. H.

In the case of those anxious to work and keep their homes together it was noticeable that after a week's wages, when nourishing food had been obtained, they gradually improved in efficiency. Advantages of Polony Work Colony work has the advantage of fresh air and healthy surroundings, and of removing men from many local temptations. For various reasons, a number of applicants have declined to leave their homes for any period, preferring to wait for local employment. Experience in Administering the Act. In administering the Act the Committee found reason to believe that a false impression was created amongst the unemployed, who, after having had the enquiry forms filled up and having received visits from the Investigators as to the correctness of the statements, felt that work was certain. As only 219 out of 1,074 applicants obtained about ten weeks' work, the disappointed balance lost confidence in the usefulness of the Act, and to some extent also in those administering it. The impression that work was coming also slackened their efforts to obtain employment elsewhere. Volunteers The Committee has not availed itself of the services of additional voluntary workers. Preliminary Investigation. The Committee had referred to them before investigation all cases where there appeared to be a technical disqualification, and if the applicant did not comply with the regulations issued by the Local Government Board no further action was taken. Applications from single men and married men without families were not investigated unless the application was for Emigration. All other applications were fully investigated. ALEX.

REED WELCH. 278 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMITTEE OF CLAPHAM PUBLIC LIBRARY, For the Year ended 31st March, 1908. The Sub-Committee have pleasure in presenting the TwentyFirst Annual Report on the work of the Clapham Library. The number of books issued during the year was 109,182 in the Lending Library and 4,663 in the Reference Library (exclusive of books in open cases), being a total issue of 113,845 volumes, and a daily average issue of 461 volumes. These figures are the highest for any year since the library was opened, and shew an increase of issues in the Lending Library of 14,249 volumes over the previous year, and a daily average increase of 49 volumes issued. The increased circulation applies to each of the eight classes of literature into which the books are divided. The number of books now in stock, after allowing for withdrawal of worn-out and obsolete works, is 16,594, of which 13,517 are in the Lending Library and 3,077 in the Reference Library. 3,779 readers' ordinary tickets (including renewals) were issued during the year. A new feature in the working has been the adoption by the Council, on the recommendation of the Clapham Sub-Committee, of a scheme entitling every reader to obtain free of charge a second or student's ticket allowing the holder to have out a book other than fiction in addition to that obtained with the ordinary ticket. This has proved very popular, as is shown by the fact that 861 of such tickets were issued from the 17th July, 1907, to 31st March, 1908. With a view to improving the boundaries of the Library, an exchange of land has been made with Messrs. Ross, Limited, by which the Library will be isolated from Rastrick House adjoining. 279 On the 10th February the Sub-Committee passed a vote of sympathy to Lady Stawell on the death of her brother, the late Canon Greene, Rector of Clapham, who was for seventeen years Chairman of the Clapham Library Commissioners and Committees. The Sub-Committee desire to express their cordial thanks to the various donors of books, periodicals, pictures, etc., during the past year. These include a bequest by the late Canon Greene of a selection of his books and local prints. The Borough Council in November, 1907, appointed the Mayor (Alderman Lorden), Alderman Bulcraig, and Councillors Cundall, Downer, Law, Monday, and Richardson, as the Sub-Committee for the Clapham Library for 1908. Councillor Downer was elected chairman, and a vote of thanks was passed to Alderman Bulcraig for his services as chairman during the previous two years. H. E. Hott, junior assistant, was appointed a second assistant in the West Hill Library in November, 1907, and J. C. Castle has been appointed a junior assistant in the Clapham Library. The Sub-Committee have great pleasure in again expressing their appreciation of the satisfactory and efficient manner in which the Librarian and his Staff have discharged their duties.

In presenting their Twentieth Annual Report the Sub Committee have pleasure in testifying to the wide appreciation by the public of the advantages offered in the various departments under their care. In December, 1907, the Borough Council appointed Alderman Parker, Councillors Hoile, Jackson and Mathias as the Sub-Committee for 1908. At the first meeting of the Sub-Committee Alderman Parker was re-elected Chairman for the year. The issue of the Quarterly List of additions to the Library has been continued. Satisfaction has been expressed by readers who appreciate this means of keeping in touch with the latest additions to the stock of the library. Decorative works have been carried out during the year, under the supervision of the Surveyor, at a cost of £36. The Sub-Committee take this opportunity of thanking all who have furthered the interest of the institution by gifts of books or otherwise. A list of donors will be found on page 291 of this report. Lending Department. There has been an increase in the stock of this department 1,165 volumes, of this number 1,161 were purchased, and 4 were presented to the library. 190 obsolete works have been withdrawn from the department, making the total number of volumes now available for use in the department 10,245. The issues from the lending department have increased by 4,967 volumes, the total for the year being 72,703 as compared with 67,736 volumes issued during the year 1906-7. On March 31st, 2,146 borrowers' tickets and 177 students' tickets were available for use in this department. 287 The practice of issuing students' tickets enabling borrowers to have additional books of a non-fictional character has been adopted, and has been much appreciated by readers. During the year 652 volumes have been re-bound, and many hundreds of minor repairs have been carried out by the Library staff. Reference Department. The privilege of free access to the books in this department is still much appreciated by residents in Putney. The Library is also extensively used by persons living in the neighbouring districts. As the books are on open shelves, no statistics are available as to the number of books used, but it is estimated that over 150 persons use the reference department daily. During the year 106 volumes have been added, making the present stock 2,307 volumes. Magazine Booms. These rooms continue to be used by a large number of readers, and it is very unusual to be able to find a chair vacant after 7 p.m. Thirty-two monthly magazines and reviews, 5 quarterlies, and 49 weekly periodicals are placed in these rooms. The magazines and reviews are transferred to the lending department at the end of the month, where they are in great demand for home reading. News Room. The list of newspapers, &c., provided in this room includes 31 daily newspapers, among which are Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Manchester, and Plymouth daily journals, 56 weekly newspapers and periodicals and 41 monthy and quarterly publications. The Sub-Committee again have much pleasure in recording their satisfaction with the work of the Librarian and his staff. I ables of information relating to the issues of books, classification ot stock, &c., will be found on pages 289 and 290. List of newspapers, periodicals, magazines, &c., will be found on pages 292-293. Signed on behalf of the Putney Library Sub-Committee. JAS. EDW. PARKER, May 7th, 1908.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Borough for the year 1907. Population. The population of the Borough as estimated by the Registrar General was, in the middle of 1907, 281,419, but this estimate, in my opinion, is much under the actual population. This estimated population was obtained by the Registrar General in the following manner:—The population of the Borough is calculated by arithmetical progression to the middle of the year. This is multiplied by a factor obtained by dividing the population of England and Wales for 1907, calculated by geometrical progression, by the population calculated by arithmetical progression. The population on which all the rates in this Report are calculated has been obtained in a similar manner to that adopted in 1905 and 1906, by dividing the number of inhabitants at the Census of 1901 by the number of rated hereditaments in that year. b 6 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The factor thus obtained represents the number of persons per rated hereditament, by which the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1907 is multiplied. Table I. shows the population of each Ward and the number of rated hereditaments in 1901, the number of hereditaments in the middle of 1907 and the estimated population. TABLE I. Ward.

The estimated uncorrected population for 1906 was 316,000, and in 1907 325,850, or an increase of 9,850, while the corrected population was, in 1906 310,310, and in 1907 320,120. The corrected population in Table II. is used to calculate the rates in this Report. The difference, between the corrected and uncorrected population is made up by the population in the Public Institutions of the Borough, which are as follows. Clapham:—Hostel of God. Putney:—The Priory, Roehampton. Streatham:—St. Anne's Home. (St. Pancras parish.) Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). B 2 8 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Tooting:—Tooting Home. Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals— The Fountain and the Grove. Newlands Asylum. Tooting Bee Asylum. Wandsworth :—The Workhouse Royal Hospital for Incurables. Northlands Home for Inebriates. Middlesex County Lunatic Asylum (part of). H.M. Prison. The total population of these Institutions was about 6,300, but as a considerable proportion of the inmates of the Tooting Home, the Workhouse, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals belong to other Boroughs, a deduction of 5,730 made from the uncorrected total population gives, approximately, the corrected population, viz.:—320,120, compared with 310,310 in 1906, 285,910 in 1905, and 264,200 in 1904. The population of this Borough for the purposes of the Equalisation of Rates Act was estimated in 1906 as 296,020, and in 1907 as 308,663, these populations being calculated from the number of rated houses. Births. During the 52 weeks ending the 28th December, 7,036 births, 3,604 of males and 3,432 of females, were registered, compared with 7,057 in 1906, 6,892 in 1905, and 6,917 in 1904. In Table III. is shown the number of births, males and females, the birth-rate, and the rate of natural increase for each sub-district, and for the whole Borough.

In that subdistrict there was an increase from 18.47 to i8'82 per 1,000. The lowest birth-rate was in Putney, where it was only 16.46 per 1,000, compared with 17.12 in 1906, and the highest in Tooting, 31.38, compared with 35.44 in 1906. The actual number of births registered was lower in all the sub-districts than in the previous year, with the exception of Streatham, where 98 more births occurred, and the total number of births in the whole Borough was 21 fewer than in 1906. The following Table shows the birth-rate in the Borough, in the five sub-districts, in London, and in England and Wales, for the year, as well as the rates for the previous 10 years, compared with the decennial average. ic Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In Clapham it was 4'37, in Putney 5-52, in Streatham 2'8o, and in Wandsworth 3'73 lower, while in Tooting it was '57 higher, and in the whole Borough 3*22 lower. In 1906 the rate was 2-73 under the decennial average, and in Tooting it was as much as 5-68 above this average. The rate for 1907 is the lowest rate yet recorded, and is "77 per 1,000 under the rate for 1906. The birth-rate for London was 25'68, compared with 26'6 in 1906, 2702 in 1905, 27'8i in 1904, and 28'6o the decennial Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 11 average; while for England and Wales the rate was 26.3 per 1,000, compared with 27,0 in 1906, 27.2 in 1905, and 28.4 the decennial average. The rate of natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 11.30 per 1,000, compared with 11.59 in 1906, and 12 50 in 1905. This rate was lowest in Putney, viz.:—6.12, and highest in Tooting, viz:—18.13. Compared with the decennial average there has been a fall in the crude birth-rate of over 12 per cent., but as the changes in the age and sex population have been marked, it is therefore necessary to calculate the proportion of births to the number of possible mothers, or the total number of women living in the Borough at ages 15 to 45. In 1901 this rate was 88. per 1,000, and in 1907 it had fallen to 74, while for the whole of London the rate for 1900-1902 was 105.8, and in 1906, 97.5. The legitimate birth-rate, calculated on the married female population, was in 1901, 215 per 1,000, and in 1907, 173, and for the whole of London 209.3 in 1906. The Registrar General in his report for 1906 states that "20 per cent. of the decline in the birth-rate is due to the decrease in the proportion of married women in the female population of conceptive age, and over 5 per cent. is due to the decrease of illegitimacy. With regard to the remaining 75 per cent. of the decrease, although some of the reduced fertility may be ascribed to changes in the age constitution of married women, there can be little doubt that much of it is due to deliberate restriction of child-bearing." 186 births occurred in the Workhouse, nine of these belonging to Clapham, six to Putney, 23 to Streatham, 13 to Tooting, 39 to Wandsworth, 77 to Battersea, and 19 to other places. Of these 186 births 117 were illegitimate, and of these six belonged to Clapham, five to Putney, 16 to Streatham, 10 to Tooting, 19 to Wandsworth, 47 to Battersea, and 14 to other places. 12 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the Borough, with the exception of the Workhouse, 133. illegitimate births were registered, 31 in Clapham, nine in Putney, 31 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 41 in Wandsworth. The total number of illegitimate births was 189, 37 of which belonged to Clapham, 14 to Putney, 47 to Streatham, 31 to Tooting, and 60 to Wandsworth, compared with 203 in 1906, and 165 in 1905. The percentage of illegitimate births to total births was 2'68, compared with 2.87 in 1906, 2.4 in 1905, and 3.9 for the whole of London for 1906. The following Table shows the percentage of illegitimate births to total births for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year, and for the two previous years. 1905. 1906. 1907.

During the 52 weeks ending the 28th December, 1907, 3,337 deaths, 1,555 of males and 1,782 of females were registered in the Borough, compared with 3,341 in 1906, 3,241 in 1905, and 3,296 in 1904. The total number of deaths is four less than in 1906, and 751 less than the decennial average corrected for increase of population. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 13 The uncorrected death-rate for the Borough was 10*24 Per 1,000, compared with 10.57 in 1906, 11.12 in 1905, and 12.22 in 1904. The average for the decennium 1897-1906 was 12.55, or 2.31 above the rate for the year 1907. In the separate sub-districts this rate shows considerable variation, in Streatham the rate being only 7 92, while in Tooting it was 25.60. The reason for this high rate in Tooting is that in that sub-district there are a large number of Public Institutions, as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting Home, and Tooting Bec Asylum, where persons from other localities are received, and among whom the mortality is very high. To ascertain the corrected death-rate corrections must be made to the above by the addition of the deaths in Outlying Institutions of persons belonging to the Borough, and the subtraction of all deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, whose domiciles were in other parts of London. The total number of deaths, corrected for both internal and external Institutions, was 3,416, compared with 3,461 in 1906, 3,320 in 1905, 3,417 in 1904, 3,023 in 1903, 3,328 in 1902, 3,130 in 1901, and 4,184 the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The total number of deaths was thus 768 under this average, compared with 697 in 1906, 562 in 1905, no in 1904, and 433 in 1903. During the year 750 deaths occurred in Public Institutions and 57 in other places not Institutions in the Borough. Of these 807, 660 deaths were of persons not belonging and 147 of persons belonging to the Borough. Table V. shows the total number of Institution deaths arranged according to sub-districts and Institutions in which they occurred, Table VI. the deaths of persons not belonging to the Borough, and Table VII. of persons belonging thereto arranged according to causes of death, sex and age, and Institution in which the death occurred. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the Middlesex County Asylum the deaths were seven less, in the Tooting Bec Asylum 36 more, in the Hostel of God three more, in Tooting Home 13 more, in the Fever Hospitals 11 more, in the Workhouse three more, in the Prison one more, in the Royal Hospital for Incurables one less, in St. Anne's Home two less, in the Priory one less, and in other places seven less than in the year 1906. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 15 Of the deaths in other places not Public Institutions 12 occurred in Clapham, 16 in Putney, 21 in Streatham, three in Tooting-, and five in Wandsworth. Table VI. shows the deaths in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, arranged as to ages, causes of death, and Institution in which the death occurred. The greatest number of deaths was due to Old Age, and of the 166 registered, 121 occurred in Tooting Bee Asylum. In the Middlesex County Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, Old Age, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, and all other causes, which include all diseases of the nervous system. In Tooting Bee Asylum the greatest number of deaths occurred from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, diseases of the Respiratory Organs, Old Age, Bright's disease and all other causes; in the Hostel of God from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Cancer; and in the Tooting Home from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and Old Age. In the Fever Hospitals, three deaths occurred from Measles, 49 from Scarlet Fever, compared with 46 in 1906, 45 from Diphtheria, compared with 30, two from Enteric Fever, two from other Continued Fevers, and four from all other causes. The two deaths from other Continued Fevers were registered as due to Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, two males, one of two years and the other of 13 years, belonging to Croydon and Lambeth respectively. 16 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Of the 357 deaths in General and Special Hospitals, 52 occurred in St. Thomas's Hospital, 30 in Bolingbroke Hospital, 18 in Horton Asylum, 17 in Banstead Asylum, 15 in Belgrave Hospital, 14 in Westminster Hospital, 13 in Charing Cross Hospital, 12 in St. George's Hospital, nine in Cane Hill Asylum, and nine in Guy's Hospital. The number of deaths in these and other Institutions outside the Borough is shown on Table XII. The corrected number of deaths after adding the deaths of persons belonging to the Borough and subtracting those of persons dying in the Borough and not belonging thereto, was 3,416, 1,643 of males and 1,773 of females, a decrease of 45 compared with 1906, and a decrease of 1,113 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate for the year was 10.67, compared with 11.15 in 1906, 11.6i in 1905, 12.93 in 19.41 12.24 in 1903, 13.43 in 1902 and 15.33 in 1901. Table IX. shows the total number of deaths and the deathrates for each sub-district and for the whole Borough, corrected and uncorrected for deaths in Public Institutions. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 14.55 Per 1,000, compared with 15.07 in 1906, 15.1 in 1905, 16.10 in 1904, 15.6 in 1903, and 17.2 in 1902. The death-rate in England and Wales in 1906 was 15.0 per 1,000, compared with 15.4 in 1906, 16.2 in 1905, and 16.2 in 1904; in the 76 Great Towns 15.4, compared with 15.9; and in the 142 Smaller Towns 14.5, compared with 14.5. 22 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This is done by multiplying the rate by a factor obtained by dividing the standard death-rate in England and Wales, at the Census of 1901, with the standard death-rate for the Borough at the same period. This factor has been ascertained to be 1.0547, which gives a rate for this Borough for the year 1907 of 11.25 per 1,000, compared with 11.76 in 1906, 12.24 in 1905, 13.60 in 1904, 12.87 in 1903, and 14.00 in 1902. The following Table shows the standard death-rate, the factor for correction, the crude death-rate, the corrected death-rate, and the comparative mortality figure for London and for the 29 Boroughs, including the City of London, for the year 1907.

CHART Showing the Annual Death-rate during each fortnight of the year 1907 and of the Quinquennium 1902- 1906 for the Metropoli tan Borough of Wandsworth. Death-rate for Quinquennium 1902-06 shown in Black. Death-rate for 1907 shown in Red. 25 Report oj the Medical Officcr of Health. In the separate sub-districts of the Borough, the death-rate was lowest in Streatham, viz. :—9.43, and highest in Tooting, viz. :—13.-25. The rate in Clapham, viz. :—10 43, was lower by .88 per 1,000 than in 1906, in Putney •34, in Streatham •16, in Tooting •24, and in Wandsworth •68. The greatest reduction, compared with 1906, occurred in Clapham, and the least in Streatham. The rates in this Table do not agree with the rates in Table XI. as the rates in the latter Table are calculated on the total population without deducting the population of non-parishioners in Public Institutions in the Borough. The first Chart shows the annual death-rate per 1,000 during each week for the whole of London and for each fortnight for the whole Borough. During the whole year the death-rate in the Borough was considerably under the rate for the whole of London, the nearest approximation being in the second fortnight of August, when the rate was 1C3 in the Borough and 12 in London. Neither in the Borough nor in London did the usual rise in the curve occur in August and September, due to the large decrease in the number of deaths of infants from Diarrhoea. The next Chart shows the death-rate in the Borough compared with the average for the quinquennium 1902-1906. This Chart shows that only on one occasion was the rate higher than this average, viz. :—in the first fortnight of July, when the rate was 9•72, compared with 9.25 per 1,000. At every other month during the year the rate was lower, and markedly so in March, August and September. Only once during the year was the rate above 15 per 1,000, viz. :— in January, while on no fewer than 10 fortnights it was under 10 per 1,000. The lowest rate in the quinquennium was in the first fortnight of July. The higher rates in January and 26 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. February were due to the number of deaths from diseases of the Respiratory Organs. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. shows the births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate per 1,000 for the whole Borough for the year, and the 10 preceding years; the total deaths of children under one year of age is also given, and the rate per 1,000 births registered. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various subdistricts. It also shows these for each year since 1897, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last to years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain age periods in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the General Mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, arranged as to cause of death. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in Public Institutions in the district, both of residents and non-residents. o — Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Ages at Death. The following Table shows the percentage of deaths to total deaths at six age periods for each sub.district and for the whole Borough. table xvi. Sub.Districts. Under 1 year. 1 to 5 years. 5 to 15 years. 15 to 25 years. 25 to 65 years. 65 years and upwards Clapham 17.42 581 2.55 4.39 36.26 33.57 Putney 17.36 4.82 3.54 3 .22 34.41 36.65 Streatham 17.71 7.56 4.21 2.91 3I.96 35.65 Tooting 35.24 13.15 6.95 372 23.32 17.62 Wandsworth 21.67 11.45 3.26 420 32.70 26.72 Whole Borough 20.93 8.81 3.83 375 32.29 30.39 Compared with 1906 the percentage of deaths under one year was 4.32 lower, due wholly to the c.onsiderable decrease in the number of infants from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis; from one to five years .05 higher; from five to 15 years .65 higher; from 15 to 25 years .34 higher; from 25 to 65 years .n lower; and from 65 years and upwards 4.39 higher. There is a considerable diversity in these rates in the different sub.districts. In Putney the rate under one year was only 17.36, while in Tooting it was 35.24, while over 65 years of age the position is reversed, Tooting having a rate of 17.62 and Putney of 36.65. In Putney the birth-rate is low and the infantile mortality low, as this sub.district is largely occupied by well.to.do people with a high age average. Again, at from one to five years the rate is still high in Tooting and low in Putney, and also at ages five to 15 and 15 to 25 years, while at ages 25 to 65 the Tooting rate is much lower and is the lowest of the five sub.districts. 33 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. As stated in previous reports, these differences are due to the difference in age distribution and social conditions in the subdistricts. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year was 715, compared with 874 in 1906, 818 in 1905, 851 in 1904, and 743i n 1903 Of these, 123 occurred in Clapham, 54 in Putney, 164 in Streatham, 142 in Tooting, and 232 in Wandsworth. The infantile mortality, or deaths under one year to 1,000 births was 101, compared with 125 in 1906, 118 in 1905, 123 in 1904, and no in 1903. This rate was 90 in Clapham, compared with 111 in 1906 and 130 the decennial average; 109 in Putney, compared with 128 and 126; 88 in Streatham, compared with 113 and 114; 148 in Tooting, compared with 146 and 151 ; and 97 in Wandsworth, compared with 131 and 139. In the whole Borough the rate was 24 per 1,000 under that for 1906, and 28 under the decennial average. The rate in 1907 was much lower than any rate ever recorded, and in each sub-district, with the exception of Tooting, it shows a marked diminution as compared with the decennial average, in Clapham showing a difference of 40, and in Wandsworth of 42 per 1,000, compared with that average. The following Table shows the number of deaths, the percentage to total deaths, the rate per 1,000 births for the year and for the three previous years for each sub-district and for the whole Borough. 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. table xvii.

The preceding Table shows the proportion of deaths per 1,000 births for each week under one month, and for each month to one year of age, from five groups of diseases. The statistics for the whole of London and for England and Wales are not yet available, so no comparison can be made between these rates and those for the whole' country. Compared with the rate for the whole of England and Wales for 1906, the proportion of deaths under one year from Infectious diseases is higher, owing to the increased number of deaths in this Borough from Whooping Cough. The proportion of deaths from Diar• rhoeal diseases is only 15.08, compared with 32.63 in England and Wales for 1906, but this rate for England and Wales will be considerably lower in 1907. From Wasting diseases, the rate from which is to some extent influenced by climatic conditions, the rate under one year in the Borough was 39•44, compared with 44'77 in England and Wales for 1906. From Tuberculous diseases the rate in the Borough was 2•75, compared with 4•92 in England and Wales for 1906, and from other causes 36•40 in the Borough, compared with 43.10. Compared with the five years 1901•05 for England and Wales, the rate in this Borough was, from common Infectious diseases 1'33 per 1,000 higher, from Diarrhceal diseases 10•36 lower, from Wasting diseases 5•97 lower, and from other causes 15.99 lower. Several other comparisons might be made, but generally the rate in the Borough for the year compared most favourably with the five years 1901•05 for the whole of England and Wales. In the preceding Table it will also be seen that the rate from common Infectious diseases was highest at 8•9 months, from Diarrhceal diseases at 3.4 months and 5•6 months, from Wasting diseases under one week, from Tuberculous diseases at 6•7 months, and from other causes at 1•2 months. From all causes the highest rate was under one week and the lowest at 10•11 months. The next Table shows the proportion of deaths among illegitimate infants to x,ooo illegitimate births, compared with the deaths among legitimate infants to 1,000 legitimate births for the year 1907. 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Although the figures on which the above Table is based are small, yet they correspond pretty closely with the figures of the Registrar General for the whole of England and Wales for the year 1906. In his report for that year he says:-"A cursory examination of these Tables suffices to prove that the waste of life among illegitimate children is enormous, the mortality under one year of age in England and Wales being 261 per 1,000 illegitimate births, against 127 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock; we find that within a year of birth illegitimate infants experience a death-rate which is higher by 106 per cent. than that of legitimate infants." In this Borough for the year 1907, this percentage was even higher, and this is attributed to the fact that many nurse children are sent to this Borough from other parts of London. The Table which follows shows the infantile mortality rate per 1,000 births for the whole Borough, and for each sub-district, from certain causes and from all causes. In this Table also the corrected number of births is used for the rates, the births occurring in the Workhouse being allocated to their respective sub-districts, and the births belonging to other places subtracted. In Clapham this mortality was very low from all causes, more especially from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, where the rate per 1,000 was only 13.91, compared with 22.76 for the whole Borough. From Premature birth the rate was highest in Tooting and lowest in Wandsworth, from Measles and Whooping Cough highest in Putney and lowest in Wandsworth, from Respiratory diseases highest in Wandsworth and lowest in Clapham, from Tuberculous diseases highest in Tooting and lowest in Streatham, and from other causes highest in Putney and lowest in Tooting. From all causes the infantile mortality was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, and, compared with 1906, the rate was lower in all the sub-districts with the exception of 1 ooting where this rate was the same. 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Compared with 1906, there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Scarlet Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Influenza, and a decrease in the number of deaths from Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, Diarrhœa, and other Septic diseases, while from Continued Fever and Erysipelas the number of deaths was the same. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been an increase in the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever and Whooping Cough, and a decrease in all the other Zymotics. The greatest increase occurred from Whooping Cough, and the greatest decrease from Diarrhcea, Measles and Diphtheria. From all Zymotic diseases the death-rate was 1.34 per 1,000 (1.o6 in Clapham, 1.13 in Putney, .93 in Streatham, 2.99 in Tooting, and 1.50 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.70 in 1906, 1.57 in 1905, 1.93 in 1904, and 2.06, the decennial average. The rate from the principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, and Diarrhcea, was .97 per 1,000 (.73 in Clapham, .8o in Putney, .65 in Streatham, 2 63 in Tooting, and .99 in Wandsworth), compared with 1.36 in 1906, 1.30 in 1905, and 1.6o in 1904. The rate in London was 1.37 per 1,000, compared with 1.94 in 1906, 1.68 in 1905, and 2.14 in 1904. The rate for England and Wales was 1.26, compared with 1.73 in 1906; in the 76 Great Towns 1.54, compared with 2.24; in the 142 Smaller Towns 1.29, compared with 1.71; and in Rural England and Wales .91, compared with 1.18. The rate for the year 1907 is the lowest yet recorded, and the great decrease is due to the decrease in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, and to a less extent from Diphtheria and Measles. In Out-lying Institutions 48 deaths occurred from Zymotic diseases (10 belonging to Clapham, five to Putney, eight to Streatham, three to Tooting, and 22 to Wandsworth), compared with 52 in 1906, 67 in 1905, and 58 in 1904. Of these deaths 33 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 11 from Measles, one from Influenza, 12 from Whooping Cough, one from Enteric Fever, two from Erysipelas, four from Puerperal Fever, and two from other Septic diseases; 10 in General and Special Hospitals, one from Measles, one from Whooping Cough, one from Diphtheria, one from Enteric Fever, one from Epidemic 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Enteritis, one from Erysipelas, and four from other Septic diseases; and five in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, one from Measles, two from Diphtheria, and two from Enteric Fever. In Institutions in the Borough 106 deaths from Zymotic diseases occurred of persons not belonging thereto, compared with 90 in 1906, and 89 in 1905. The increase in 1907 is largely due to the increase in the number of deaths from Diphtheria. Of these 101 occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at Tooting, 49 from Scarlet Fever, 45 from Diphtheria, three from Measles, two from Enteric Fever, and two from Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. One death from Influenza and one from Erysipelas occurred in the Middlesex County Asylum; one from Enteric Fever in the Prison; and two from Influenza in the Royal Hospital for Incurables. Of the total deaths from this group of diseases, 50 occurred in the Fever Hospitals at Tooting, two from Measles, 20 from Scarlet Fever, and 28 from Diphtheria; and one death from Erysipelas in the Tooting Home. Compared with 1906, this shows an increase of seven deaths from Scarlet Fever, and a decrease of three deaths from Diphtheria. The next Table shows the death-rates from these diseases for the whole Borough and for each sub-district for the year 1907, as well as for the preceding 10 years, and the rates above or below the decennial average are also shown. 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, while, compared with the decennial average, Clapham shows the greatest reduction and Wandsworth the next. The rate for Tooting was .53 above the decennial average, although it was .05 under the rate for 1906. This high rate was due to the number of deaths from Diarrhœa, Measles, Whooping Cough, and Diphtheria. Notification of Infectious Diseases.

Compared with 1906 there has been an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, and a decrease of Erysipelas and Enteric Fever, while Puerperal Fever.is the same. Cerebro-spinal Meningitis was not notifiable in 1906, but only three cases were notified in 1907. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Compared with the corrected decennial average there has been a decrease in the number of cases of Small-pox, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Continued Fever, and Erysipelas, and an increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever and Puerperal Fever. The total number of cases notified was 2,270 (360 in Clapham, 168 in Putney, 592 in Streatham, 501 in Tooting, and 649 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,030 in 1906, 2,211 in 1905, and 1,540 in 1904. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 6.97, compared with 6.42 in 1906, 7.5 in 1905, and 5.8 in 1904. The rates in the sub-districts were as follows:—in Clapham 5.34, compared with 5.36 in 1906, 6.2 in 1905, and 4.05 in 1904; Putney 5.57, compared with 3.3, 3.2, and 4.2; Streatham 6.oo, compared with 5.3, 5.4, and 5.4; Tooting 15.45, compared with 10.2, 10.5, and 6.9; and Wandsworth 6.77, compared with 7.4, 11.3, and 8.1. In the County of London this rate was 8.72, compared with 7.5 in 1906, 7.0 in 1905, and 6.0 in 1904. In Public Institutions within the Borough six cases of Erysipelas, seven of Scarlet Fever, three of Diphtheria, and one of Puerperal Fever were notified from the Workhouse; three cases of Erysipelas from the Middlesex County Asylum; 14 cases of Scarlet Fever from the Tooting Bec Asylum; one case of Scarlet Fever from the Fountain Fever Hospital; 32 cases of Scarlet Fever, 19 of Diphtheria, and two of Erysipelas from the Grove Fever Hospital; three cases of Enteric Fever and two of Erysipelas from the Prison; one case of Scarlet Fever, 14 of Diphtheria and two of Erysipelas from the Intermediate Schools; and one case of Scarlet Fever from the Royal Patriotic Asylum; a total of 111, compared with 88 in 1906, 94 in 1905, and 69 in 1904. The increase in 1907 is chiefly due to the number of cases of Diphtheria notified from the Intermediate Schools, and the increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever from the Grove Hospital. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Institutions outside the Borough of persons belonging to the Borough, 17 cases of Erysipelas, six of Enteric Fever, two of Scarlet Fever, and seven of Puerperal Fever were notified from the Union Infirmary; one case of Enteric Fever from St. George's Hospital; one case of Enteric Fever and one case of Erysipelas from Charing Cross Hospital; two cases of Diphtheria from the Victoria Hospital for Children; one of Diphtheria from St. Thomas's Hospital; one case of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from Guy's Hospital; one case of Erysipelas from the West London Hospital; three cases of Diphtheria from the Northern Hospital; three cases of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from the London Fever Hospital; one case of Scarlet Fever from the New Hospital for Women; one case of Enteric Fever from King's College Hospital; one case of Scarlet Fever from Belgrave Hospital; one case of Erysipelas from St. Bartholomew's Hospital; one case of Diphtheria and one of Cerebro-spinal Meningitis from Evelina Hospital; and one case of Erysipelas from the Home for Sick Children, Sydenham; a total of 55, compared with 92 in 1906. Vaccination. Table XXXIII. is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Board of Guardians for the year 1906. It shows the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. Streatham, Balham and Tooting are included under the heading of Streatham. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXXIII. SubDistricts.

This is a decided decrease compared with the previous year. The next Table shows the percentage of children vaccinated to total births registered in the Borough, and in the vaccination sub-districts for the year 1906, as well as for the 10 years 18961905. The average for the 10 years is also shown on this Table. Compared with 1905 there has been a decrease in the percentage of successfully vaccinated in all the sub-districts, this decrease having been greatest in Clapham and least in Putney, while in the whole Borough there has been a decrease of 3.45 per cent. Compared with the decennial average there has been a considerable increase in Putney, a slight increase in Streatham and Wandsworth, but a decrease in Clapham. 575 infants died unvaccinated, a percentage of 8.1, compared with 8.4 in 1905, and 8.6 in 1904. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 1,477 infants remaining, 15 or .21 per cent. were stated to have been insusceptible to vaccination; 186 or 2.6 per cent. in respect of whom certificates of conscientious objection were received; 333 or 47 per cent. had vaccination postponed by medical certificate, leaving 722 or 10.1 per cent. as removed, not to be traced, or otherwise unaccounted for, while 221 or 3.1 per cent. remained on the books as unvaccinated, compared with 7.7 per cent. as removed, etc., in 1905, and 3.1 remaining as unvaccinated. There has been a considerable increase in the percentage of cases removed, and this increase chiefly occurred in the subdistricts of Streatham and Wandsworth. If the total number of infants who died unvaccinated be deducted from the total number of births registered, then of 6,513, the remaining infants, 78.1 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, compared with 81.5 in 1905, and 80.5 in 1904; .23 were insusceptible, compared with .3 and .48; 5.1 per cent. were under certificate of postponement, compared with 4.2 and 3.4; 2.8 per cent. in regard to whom certificates of conscientious objection had been obtained, compared with 2.2 and 2.1; leaving 14.5 per cent. unaccounted for as regards vaccination, compared with 11.8 and 13.1. The returns for the year 1906 do not compare favourably with 1905, and show only a slight improvement compared with the decennial average. TABLE XXXIV.

The percentage of children remaining unvaccinated, including cases postponed, to total births during the last 10 years was as follows for this Borough and for the Metropolis:— 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 Wandsworth 19.2 20.8 17.7 15.6 15.0 15.7 1.59 15.3 14.6 18.0 Metropolis 29.1 33.0 27.7 25.8 24.1 21.3 20.7 19.1 ... ... Scarlet Fever. 1,330 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified during the year, compared with 1,069 in 1906, 1,494 in 1905, and 744 in1904. 205 of these were in Clapham, 82 in Putney, 378 in Streatham, 318 in Tooting, and 347 in Wandsworth. 1,128 or 84.8 per cent. of these cases were removed to hospital where 20 died, and 202 or 15.2 per cent. were treated at home with two deaths. The total number of deaths was 22, of which four were in Clapham, one in Putney, five in Streatham, six in Tooting, and six in Wandsworth. The percentage of cases removed to hospital is the highest recorded, as in 1906, 83.8 per cent. were removed; in 1905, 84.1; in 1904, 81.6; in 1903, 78.1; in 1902, 75; and in 1901, 70.6 per cent. The case mortality was 1.65 per cent., compared with 1.78 in 1906, 1.87 in 1905, 1.74 in 1904, and 2.19 in 1903. The mortality among cases removed to hospital was 1.77 per cent., compared with 1.79 in 1906, and among those treated at home .99, compared with 1.72 in 1906. The mortality among the home treated cases is much lower than among those cases treated in hospital, while in 1906 the rate was about the same, and in 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1905 the rate among the hospital treated cases was five times greater then among those treated at home. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 4.08, compared with 3.4 in 1906, 5.1 in 1905, and 2.8 in 1904, and in the County of London 5.53, compared with 4.3, 4.1, and 2.89. The proportion of cases notified was thus 1.45 per 1,000 lower in this Borough than for the whole of London, while in 1906 it was .9 per 1,000 lower. The following Table shows the rate of notified cases per 1,000 persons living for each sub-district and for the whole Borough for the year and the three previous years, as well as the corresponding rates for the whole of London. TABLE XXXV. Sub-Districts. 1904 1905 1906 1907 Clapham 1.8 4.1 2.7 3.04 Putney 3.0 1.8 1.1 2.72 Streatham 2.6 3.2 2.6 3.83 Tooting. 3.1 7.0 7.9 9.8o Wandsworth 3.2 8.2 3.7 3.56 Whole Borough 2.8 5.1 3.4 4.08 London 2.89 4.1 4.3 5.53 In Clapham, Putney, Streatham and Tooting the rate was higher than in 1906, while in Wandsworth it was slightly lower. In Clapham the greatest number of cases was notified in October, and the smallest number in February. There was a considerable increase in the number of cases in Putney in 1907, compared with 1906, 82 cases having been notified, compared with 34. 61 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The disease was most prevalent in August and November, and least so in February. The increase in August was due to the occurrence of several cases in Roehampton, due to an unrecognised case. Eight cases occurred in that district caring the month, and six at least of these were infected by one case which was unrecognised till desquamation was noticed. There was nothing special in the incidence of the disease in November, as the cases occurred sporadically all over the sub-district. Three cases, however, occurred in one home and two in another, four of the cases having been infected by an unrecognised case. In Streatham the maximum number of cases was notified in November, and the minimum in August. This disease was considerably more prevalent in Strealham during 1907 than in the previous year. This increase was largely due to school infection, as will be seen from the Table, the number of cases occurring in August showing a considerable decrease compared with July, and September a still further fall. In October the number of cases increased and reached the maximum in November. The increase in November was due to an outbreak in Balham, in a Children's Home, and occurred among children residing there. The first case was a nurse who was notified on the 18th November, and who, in my opinion infected the first cases. The infection once introduced was most difficult to eradicate, as the children being so young and the cases so mild it was impossible to detect the disease in its earliest stages. I visited the institution myself on two occasions in company with the medical attendant, and I was perfectly satisfied that everything was being done to arrest the outbreak. All the cases were removed to hospital and no deaths occurred in 1907, but one of the cases notified in 1907 died in January, 1908. In all 22 cases occurred, 15 in November and seven in December. The outbreak continued to a slight extent in January, 1908, but only three cases were notified in that month, the last on the 13th. The premises have been thoroughly disinfected and the children as they return from hospital are taken to another residence in Streatham, which has been acquired for the purpose of a Children's Home. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In Tooting, Scarlet Fever was very prevalent during the whole year, but more especially in October, November and December, and here also school infection played an important part, although a large number of cases were due to unrecognised cases. The maximum number of cases occurred in October, and the minimum in March. The rate in Tooting was 9'8o, much above the rate in any of the other sub-districts, and 1.9 above the rate for 1906. From the Fever Hospitals 33 cases were notified, and 14 from the Tooting Bec Asylum, and if these be deducted the rate would be 8.6 per 1,000, compared with 7.8 in 1906. As stated in my Report for 1906, one reason for the greater incidence of Scarlet Fever in Tooting is the fact that the number of school children in that sub-district is greater in proportion to the population than in any other sub-district in the Borough. Another reason for the prevalence of the disease in Tooting is the fact that, compared with other parts of the Borough, Tooting contains a large proportion of the artizan and labouring classes, a considerable number of the latter class being poor and unable or unwilling to call in a medical man when the first symptoms appear. The consequence is that the patient is permitted to go about while in an infected condition, with, in many instances, serious consequences to others. One case which occurred in Tooting was, in my opinion, directly responsible for about 30 other cases, and the parent was summoned for wilful exposure of his child. The magistrate, however, did not convict as he was of opinion that the parent did not wilfully expose the child, although he stated that great carelessness had been shown, and that the Sanitary Authorities were quite right in having issued a summons. In Wandsworth this disease was slightly less prevalent than in the previous year, the rate per 1,000 of population being 3.56, compared with 37. The maximum number of cases was notified in October and the minimum in February. 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The disease was not confined to any particular part of the sub-district, nor to any school in particular, although school infection was an important factor in the spread. The following Table shows the number of cases notified in each sub-district during each month of the year 1907, and for the whole year. TABLE XXXVI. SubDistricts. January. February. March. April.

Scarlet Fever and Schools. The next Table shows the number of cases of Scarlet Fever for each month of the year among children in attendance at elementary and other schools for each sub-district, also the number for the whole Borough, the number of cases among persons not at school, the number attending schools outside the Borough, as well as the number of cases in which, as far as could be ascertained, the diagnosis of Scarlet Fever was incorrect. Of the total number of cases, viz.:-1,330, the diagnosis was incorrect in 58 or 4.4 per cent.; 708 or 33.2 per cent. were in attendance at schools in the Borough; 57 or 4.3 per cent. attended schools outside the Borough; while 507 or 38.1 per cent. did not attend school, being either above or under school age. The percentage of children attending school varied somewhat in the sub-districts. For example, in Clapham 121 out of 205, or 59 per cent. were at school; in Putney 38 out of 82, or 46.3 per cent.; in Streatham 209 out of 378, or 55.2 per cent.; in Tooting 131 out of 318, or 41.2 per cent.; and in Wandsworth 209 out of 347, or 6o.2 per cent. The percentage in Tooting is lower for two reasons, one being that a number of children in Tooting attend schools in Balham, and the other that 47 cases were notified from the Fever Hospitals and the Tooting Bec Asvlum.

The increase in the latter part of the year was not confined to this Borough, but was general all over London. Of the total number of cases notified, viz.:—1,330, nine or .6 per cent. were under one year, compared with eight or .7 per cent. in 1906; 322 or 24.2 per cent. were from one to five years, compared with 264 or 24 per cent.; 786 or 59.1 per cent. from five to 15 years, compared with 621 or 59 per cent.; 143 or 10.8 per cent. from 15 to 25 years, compared with 127 or 17.7 per cent.; and 70 or 5.3 Per cent. from 25 to 65 years, compared with 49 or 4.6 per cent. Up to 15 years the percentages compared with the previous years do not differ much, from 15 to 25 years there has been a decided decrease, while from 25 to 65 years there has been a slight increase.

The total number of cases notified was 629 (79 in Clapham, 65 in Putney, 157 in Streatham, 138 in Tooting, and 190 in Wandsworth), compared with 566 in 1906, and 348 in 1905. This number, although 100 above the uncorrected, is 72 under the corrected decennial average. In Clapham there has been a decrease of 27, in Putney an increase of 30, in Streatham a decrease of eight, in Tooting an increase of 60, and in Wandsworth an increase of eight, compared with 1906. The greatest number of cases occurred in Wandsworth and the smallest in Putney. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 1.93, compared with 1.79 in 1906, and 1.21 in 1905, and in London 1.65, compared with 1.70. 512 or 81.4 per cent. of the cases were removed to hospital where 31 died, and 117 or 18.6 per cent. were treated at home with 10 deaths. The case mortality was 6.3 per cent., compared with 8'9 per cent. in 1906, 8.9 in 1905, and 10.8 in 1904. The case mortality for the whole of London for the year 1907 was 8.89 per cent., compared with 8.7 per cent. in 1906, and 8.5 in 1905. The case mortality among cases treated in hospital was 6.05 per cent., and among those treated at home 8.5 per cent. The great reduction in the mortality is to a large extent due to the earlier use of antitoxin, both in the cases treated in hospital and in those treated at home. The following Table shows the number of cases, the caserate per 1,000 living, for the year and for the 10 previous years, the number of deaths and the death-rate for the whole Borough, as well as for the separate sub-districts. d 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

CHART Showing the number of DIPHTHERIA notified during each week of the year 1907. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Chart shows the number of cases notified during each week of the year. The maximum number of cases was notified in the third week of December, when 40 cases occurred, and the minimum in the last week of August, when only two cases occurred. In the first week of March, 24 cases were notified, and in the last week 23 cases, the increase being due to the number of cases in Tooting, Streatham and Wandsworth, but there was no special outbreak, the cases being scattered over a large area. In Streatham and Tooting school infection played a considerable part and this was chiefly noticeable in Oldridge Road, Smallwood Road, and Tooting Graveney Schools. Until the month of November the number of cases of Diphtheria notified was under the average, but in that month there was a slight increase, this increase being observed in all the subdistricts except Putney. In the third week of December 40 cases were notified, this being almost wholly due to an outbreak in connection with Roehampton School. There were only two outbreaks during the year that call for special notice, one a very slight one in the Intermediate Schools, Wandsworth, and the other in connection with the National School, Roehampton. The following report, which was laid before the Public Health Committee, gives full details of this outbreak in the Intermediate Schools, Wandsworth. "13th June, 1907. "I have to report the occurrence of a slight outbreak of Diphtheria in the Intermediate Schools, Swaffield Road, Wandsworth. "These schools are occupied by children of paupers belonging to the Boroughs of Battersea and Wandsworth, and I have been informed that they have been certified to accommodate 103 children. At the time of my visit there were nearly 150 children residing on the premises, a condition of things which would, in my opinion, facilitate the spread of an infectious disease such as Diphtheria. d 2 72 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "The particulars of the outbreak are as follows:-On the 28th May, a notification was received from the Deputy Medical Officer to the effect that a child, Alice Greggs, aged nine years, was suffering from Diphtheria and had been removed to hospital the day previous. This was followed on the 29th by a notification of a second case, Florrie Whitmore, aged nine, and on the same day a third, Doris Lenton, who was notified by the Medical Officer—Dr. A. E. Dodson. These three cases had definite clinical symptoms, but I was of opinion that it was most important that the throats of all the children should be swabbed so that any 'carrier' case could be at once excluded. "On the 29th May, I communicated with the Deputy Medical Officer and advised him that it would be desirable to swab the throats of the children who had been in contact with the cases which had been notified. I was informed that Dr. Dodson had visited the schools himself, and I thereupon communicated with him on the matter. The Medical Officer at my request, on 29th May, took swabs from the throats of 44 children, and on bacteriological examination it was found that in three cases the Klebs Loeffler bacilli were found, in 34 Hoffman's bacilli were found, while only seven gave negative results. "On the 31st May, another case with clinical symptoms was notified by the Medical Officer, viz.:—Thomas Holyoake, aged seven, and as this boy slept in a dormitory which had not previously been infected I advised the Medical Officer to take swabs from the throats of all the children in the other dormitories in that block. This was done on the 31st May, and the report showed that in seven cases Klebs Loeffler bacilli were present, in 11 Hoffman's bacilli, while in 30 a negative result was obtained. "All the cases in which Klebs Loeffler bacilli were found were removed to hospital. "On the 3rd June I visited the schools in company with the Medical Officer and made enquiries as to the possible 73 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. origin of the first case, and I was informed that this child was admitted on the 7th May from No. 10, Verran Road, Balham, along with her brother, Frederick Greggs, and I was also informed by the matron that she was in good health when admitted and this was corroborated by the statement of a relative at No. 10, Verran Road. "Before the admission of the girl, however, there had been no signs of any sore throats in the school, and although Alice Greggs showed no clinical symptoms on admission it is quite possible that the bacillus was present in her throat. The first symptoms of her case occurred on the 25th May, and until the 27th she slept in dormitory No. 5. Four other cases occurred in this dormitory, three of them occupying beds in close proximity to Alice Greggs. "The infected dormitories and the clothing of the patients were thoroughly disinfected, and up to the present time (13th June) no further cases have occurred, and it is to be hoped that the promptitude with which the swabbing was carried out by the Medical Officer and the elimination of the 'carrier' cases will have had the effect of stopping the outbreak. "There is one feature of this outbreak which calls for attention, not only on account of its probable association with the outbreak but also on account of the fact that in two previous outbreaks, which I have had to report, the same condition with regard to the drainage existed. On the occurrence of the first case I was informed that part of the basement had been flooded with sewage on the 17th May, and that this sewage had to be baled out. Slight flooding of the basement also occurred on the 1st June. Careful examination of the drain showed that the Couzen's intercepting trap which had been fitted was not in working order, and that by some means it had been tampered with and rendered useless to prevent the back-flooding of sewage from the main sewer in time of excessive rainfall. This defect has now been remedied, and if the intercepting trap is carefully examined at regular intervals I apprehend that no further flooding will occur." 74 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. No further cases were notified from this school during the rest of the year. The other outbreak, at Roehampton National School, was in some respects of a more serious character, as the homes of the children at this school are scattered over a considerable area, and there are also two Institutions, the Hambro Orphanage and the Children's Home, in the village, the children from which attend this school. The outbreak was confined to the Infants' Department, and the following report on the matter was laid before the Public Health Committee. "6th January, 1908. "I have to report the occurrence of an outbreak of Diphtheria in connection with the Girls' and Infants' Department of the Public School at Roehampton. The first intimation I received of the existence of Diphtheria in this village was on the 7th December, when a case was notified from a house in Wandsworth, the child being in attendance at the Infants' Department at Roehampton. This case had definite clinical symptoms and was removed to hospital on the same day that the notification was received. The first symptoms of this case occurred on the 6th December, but no cause of infection could at that time be discovered. On the 9th, however, a swab was taken from the throat of a child also in attendance at the Infants' School, and on the 10th I received information from the Lister Institute that a positive result had been obtained. This case was also removed to hospital. On enquiry it was found that the date of the first symptoms in this child was the 3rd December, and that it had been in attendance at school on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, while in an infective condition. It seems possible that this case was the cause of the other cases, as all the children affected, as well as the teacher of the class, were in close communication with this child in school. The only source of infection that could be ascertained in this case was that the child had been taken on the Sunday previous (i.e., the 1st December) to Fulham and Southfields, and may have come into contact with other cases on that date. 75 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "On Thursday, the 12th, I communicated with the Education Department, London County Council, and advised that the throats of all the children in the Infants' Department should be swabbed. This was done that afternoon and on the 13th I received a communication from the Education Department stating that a positive result had been obtained in six cases. The Medical Officer who examined the children stated that clinically there were no definite symptoms in those in whom the positive results were obtained, except slight inflammation on one side of the throat. Four of these six cases were at once removed to hospital and the premises disinfected. "In all, 18 cases were notified among children attending the Girls' and Infants' combined school, and these notifications were received as follows:-one on the 7th, three on the 12th, one on the 13th, six on the 14th, three on the 16th, two on the 18th, one on the 19th, and one on the 20th. 15 of these cases were removed to hospital. "On the 17th December I visited Roehampton and saw the Head Mistress of the school, who informed me that several children had not been at school on Thursday afternoon and in consequence were not examined by the Medical Officer to the Education Department. As it was important to ascertain if any of these children were suffering from sore throat their homes were visited, and in one case it was ascertained that the child had a sore throat, and that a medical man was in attendance. I communicated with the medical attendant advising him to take a swab, but this was not done. He has, however, since informed me that the child is probably suffering from Diphtheritic paralysis, and there is no doubt but that this child had an attack of Diphtheria. Two other cases that were not at school on the 12th were also notified, one on the 19th and the other on the 20th December. "In Roehampton there are three institutions for the reception of children, but in only two of these do the children attend the public school. One of the cases swabbed by the Medical Officer to the Education Department was an inmate of one of these institutions, and I advised the Medical Officer 76 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. of that institution to examine all the children and swab any that he thought suspicious. This was done on the 16th, with the result that another case was discovered. The Medical Officer of the other institution communicated with me in the matter as he was of opinion that some of the girls in his institution had sore throat, and I advised him to at once swab the throats of all the children and nurses. This was done on the 17th, and on the 18th I received information from the Lister Institute that out of 29 swabs taken, 15 gave a positive result, four were negative, and in 10 the Hoffman's bacillus was present. I visited the institution on the 19th, along with the Medical Officer and I advised him to isolate the 15 cases in the institution and to keep them under observation for 10 days or a fortnight, and at the end of that period to take swabs from the 15 positive cases. This was done on the 1st January, and three positive results were obtained, 11 negative, and in one Hoffman's bacillus was found to be present. "In all 33 cases of Diphtheria have occurred, the majority of these, however, only having been recognised by bacteriological examination. "The Girls' and Infants' School was thoroughly disinfected with formalin on the 17th December, and I advised the destruction of some books and cards which had been used by the infected children. The whole of the sanitary arrangements in this school were tested last year and a certificate granted by me to the effect that the result was satisfactory. On the occasion of my visit on the 17th, all the sanitary arrangements were in a satisfactory condition. "There are about 107 children, 32 in the Infants' room and 75 in the Girls' room, in atendance at the school. "I also observed in the school that only one roller towel was supplied for the use of over 100 children, and I was informed that this was only changed once a week. It is quite possible that this towel was infected by the child first notified, and also that the other children were infected by using the same towel. I have advised the managers to give instructions for a clean towel to be provided each day. 77 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "No case in connection with the school has been notified since the 20th December, but to prevent any further infection of the school I have advised the Medical Officer to the Education Department to examine all the children in the Infants' Department specially, when the school is opened on the 13th January. In addition to this precaution I have given instruction to the Sanitary Inspectors to make a house-to-house visitation of the homes of all the children attending the Girls' and Infants' School to ascertain if there has been any sickness during the time the school was closed. "Roehampton has been for some years free from an outbreak of Diphtheria, but on referring to the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for Putney for 1896, I find that in November of that year a similar outbreak occurred in connection with the school. The type of disease at that time was extremely mild and although 23 cases were notified no death occurred. "All the cases which have occurred in the present outbreak have been of a very mild type, and, as previously stated, the majority would not have been recognised as Diphtheria without a bacteriological examination. All the cases removed to hospital are at the present time convalescent, and no deaths have so far occurred. "When the first case occurred I communicated with the vicar of the parish and advised him to close the Sundayschools until he heard further from me in the matter. "The outbreak being now, in my opinion, at an end, I have advised him that he might re-open the Sunday-schools on the 12th January, and I have also advised the Education Department, London County Council, that, in my opinion, the day school could be re-opened on the 13th instant. "The sewers and gullies in all the streets have been examined and found to be in a satisfactory condition. The gullies were thoroughly cleansed and disinfected." 78 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The throats of all the children in the Infants' and Girls'' Department were swabbed by a Medical Officer from the Education Department, London County Council, on the 13th January, 1908, and in six cases the Klebs Loeffier bacillus was found. These cases had no clinical symptoms, but were isolated at once, and no further cases have since been notified in connection with the school up to the end of January, 1908. Some difficulty has been experienced in connection with the Children's Home, as two of the cases, up to the end of January, 1908, continued to give positive results after bacteriological examination, but no extension of the disease occurred in the Institution. The other children in the Home were not permitted to attend school. The medical attendant of that Home has, however, taken every precaution to prevent the spread of the disease in the Home,, and the children will not be allowed to attend school until they are all bacteriologically free from the bacillus. Diphtheria and School Attendance. The following Table shows the number of cases of Diphtheria and their relation to the schools in the Borough. 79 Report of the Medical Officer of Health TABLE XI.

Of the remaining cases, viz.:-320, in 44 or 7 per cent., the diagnosis was incorrect, and 276 or 44 per cent. were not in attendance at school. 81 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The low rate in Tooting and the high rate in Streatham is due to the fact that a number of children who had Diphtheria in Tooting were in attendance at Broadwater Road and Smallwood Road Schools, which are in the Streatham sub-district. A further examination of the Table shows that in Putney only four cases occurred in connection with schools in the first 11 months of the year, and if it had not been for the outbreak at Roehampton only six cases would have been notified from that sub-district. Of the total cases notified, 44 were incorrectly diagnosed, compared with 30 in 1906, leaving a total of 585, compared with 531 in 1906, and 312 in 1905. Only 21 cases occurred in connection with private schools, compared with 48 in 1906. No cases of Diphtheria were notified as having occurred in children attending the following elementary schools in the Borough:— In Clapham:— Aristotle Road. Bonneville Road. Christchurch, Union Grove. Clapham Parochial, Old Town. Clapham Parochial, Macaulay Road. St. Mary's Roman Catholic, Crescent Lane. St. Mary's Roman Catholic, Park Place. In Putney:— Convent School, Roehampton. Girls' School, Walker's Place. All Saints', Lower Common. In Streatham:— Holy Trinity, Lutheran Place. Immanuel, Streatham Common. Nightingale Square Roman Catholic. St. Andrew's, Colmar Road. St. Andrew's, Polworth Road. St. Mary's, Balham. In Wandsworth:— St. Thomas's, Wandsworth Plain. 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 17 schools remained free from Diphtheria, and of these 15 were non-provided schools. In connection with cases of Diphtheria occurring in elementary schools, the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, took specimens from the throats of children in certain classes in four schools during the year. In March, a number of swabs were taken from children in Smallwood Road School, but no Klebs Loeffler bacilli were found, although in five children suspicious organisms were detected. These children were excluded and their homes visited, but no cases of true Diphtheria resulted from them. In June, the children at New Road School were examined, but none were found with suspicious organisms present. In December, as stated in the special report on the subject, the children at Roehampton School were examined. Prompt examination of children's throats is a most important factor in preventing outbreaks of this disease, as "carrier" cases can at once be excluded. These "carrier" cases may, and very frequently do, present no clinical symptoms, and some difficulty has been experienced in bringing home, not only to parents, but also to medical men, the fact that as far as schools are concerned, these "carrier" cases are cases which the Health Authorities must keep under observation, and which should be isolated until a negative result has been obtained by bacteriological examination. Of the total number of cases of Diphtheria, 201 or 31.9 per cent. occurred among children under five years of age, 326 or 51.9 per cent. from five to 15 years, and 102 or i6.2 per cent. over 15 years. Of the 512 cases removed to hospital, 54 were reported not to be suffering from Diphtheria. Drainage defects were found in 92 of the houses in which cases of Diphtheria occurred. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 41 cases of Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of cases from the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, compared with 24 in 1906, 51 in 1905, and 17 in 1904. There was, however, only one return case of Diphtheria, compared with three in 1906. Two of the return cases occurred in Clapham, two in Putney, 12 in Streatham, 11 in Tooting, and 14 in Wandsworth. The return case of Diphtheria was in Wandsworth. The following Table shows the date of removal to hospital of the first case, the date of return from hospital, the number of days the first case was in hospital, the date of the first symptoms of the subsequent case, and the number of days elapsing between the return of the first case and the first symptoms of the subsequent case or cases. The average number of days the cases of Scarlet Fever were in hospital was 58.6, while in the case of Diphtheria the infecting case had been isolated for 23 days. 84 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Wandsworth 1907 Jan. 22nd 1907 Feb. 14th 23 1907 Feb. 21 st 7 Enteric Fever. 70 cases of Enteric Fever were notified during the year (18 from Clapham, six from Putney, 12 from Streatham, nine from Tooting, and 25 from Wandsworth), compared with 96 in 1906, and 96 in 1905. 42 of the cases were removed to hospital where four died, and 38 were treated at home with six deaths. The total number of deaths was 10 (two in Clapham, one in Putney, three in Streatham, one in Tooting, and three in Wandsworth), compared with 15 in 1906, 11 in 1905, and 11 in 1904. The number of deaths was five less than in 1906, and 13.3 under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .21, compared with .30 in 1906, and .33 in 1905, and with .29 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from Fever was .03 per 1,000, compared with .048 in 1906, .04 in 1905, and .04 in 1904, while the rate for the whole of London was .04, compared with .05 in 1906, .05 in 1905, and .06 in 1904. The death-rate in the sub-districts was practically the same, viz.:-.03 per 1,000. 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Of the 42 cases removed to hospital, 10 or 23.3 per cent. were found not to be suffering from Enteric Fever. The Chart shows the number of cases notified in each week during the year. Of the 70 cases notified, 11 were not Enteric Fever, and four were notified from H.M. Prison, leaving 55 cases in which special enquiry was made as to the probable cause of infection. In 10 of the cases the disease was in all probability contracted by eating shell-fish, and in nine the disease was contracted outside the Borough (one in America, one in Germany, one in France, one in Belgium, one on board ship coming from Australia, and four in other places). No cases occurred which could be traced to previous cases. With regard to the 10 cases presumably due to shell-fish, four were from oysters, four from mussels, and two from winkles. The following are the particulars of the cases probably due to shell-fish:— (1.) J. F., notified on the 3rd October. Had oysters on the 6th September, at Margate. The first symptoms appeared about the 18th September. (2.) E. F., notified on the 18th February. Had oysters at St. Malo about a fortnight previous to the onset of the disease. (3.) F. R., notified on the 25th October. Had oysters in New York. (4.) G. H., notified on the 18th November. Was a regular consumer of oysters in the City. This case proved fatal. (5.) A. W., notified on the 20th February. Had mussels regularly from peripatetic dealers. (6.) K. M., notified on the 5th April. Had mussels from a local dealer about a fortnight before the onset of the disease. C H A RT Showing the number of ca ses of ENTERIC FEVER notified during each week of the year1907. 87 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. {7.) C. C., notified on the 16th October. Had mussels from a local dealer on several occasions in September. (8.) A. T., notified on the 10th December. Had mussels from a local dealer on the 19th November, and the first symptoms of the disease appeared on the 1st December. The local dealer was supplied by a wholesale dealer at Billingsgate, and the Medical Officer of Health for the City was informed of the case. (g.) W. P., notified on the 15th April. Had winkles about the third week in March, and the first symptoms appeared about the 3rd April. (10.) G. W., notified on the 7th August. Had winkles from a local dealer about the 14th July, and the first symptoms of the disease appeared about the 30th July. This case proved fatal. In one of the cases contracted outside the Borough, the patient was employed emptying cesspools, and probably contracted the disease at this occupation. The cases contracted in France and Belgium both proved fatal. In every case the drains of the house were tested, and in only two was there any defect found. In other seven premises there were slight defects necessitating the service of a notice. Cases of Mistaken Diagnosis. In iii cases (58 of Scarlet Fever, 44 of Diphtheria, and nine of Enteric Fever), information was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals that the patients were not suffering from the disease notified or any other notifiable disease, compared with 93 in 1906, 97 in 1905, and 94 in 1904. Of the 1,682 cases removed to hospital, in 111 or 6.5 per cent, the diagnosis was incorrect, compared with 6*7 per cent, in 1906, 5.2 per cent, in 1905, and 10 per cent, in 1904. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. There has been a slight decrease in the percentage of incorrect diagnosis in Scarlet Fever, an increase in Diphtheria, and a decrease in Enteric Fever, compared with the previous year, although there has been an increase in the case of Diphtheria compared with 1906, yet compared with 1904 and 1905, there has , been a decrease.

Cerebro-Spinal Fever. Three cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever were notified during the year, two from Streatham, and one from Wandsworth. One ot the cases from Streatham was notified from the Evelina Hospital and died there. Post-mortem examination showed that the death was due to Posterior Basic and not to Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. The other case in Streatham proved to be a case of Pneumonia and recovered. The third case, notified from Wandsworth, died, but further examination showed that death in this case also was due to Basic 89 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Meningitis. In two of the cases lumbar puncture was performed, and in neither was the meningococcus found. Two deaths occurred in the Grove Hospital from this disease, one of the cases belonging to South Croydon, and the other to Lambeth. 153 cases were notified during the year in London. 21 deaths were registered as having been due to Simple Meningitis, one in Clapham, two in Putney, 13 in Streatham, none in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth. 10 of these were of infants under one year, seven from one to five years, and four above five years of age. In all these cases enquiries were made from the medical man in attendance, and replies were received in every case stating that the deaths were due, in their opinion, to Simple and not Cerebro-spinal Meningitis. Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 466 bacteriological examinations were made at the Lister Institute, compared with 407 in 1906, 174 in 1905, 121 in 1904, 125 in 1903, 98 in 1902, and 66 in 1901. The following Table shows the number of examinations in each sub-district and for the whole Borough, also the disease for which the examination was made and the result of such examination. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In Tooting there has also been an increase, due to the medical men in that district taking greater advantage of this method of diagnosis. In 147 out of 454 examinations for the bacillus of Diphtheria, the result was positive, and in five out of 12 examinations of blood in suspected cases of Enteric Fever, the Widal reaction was obtained. Puerperal Fever. 25 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, compared with 25 in igo6, 18 in igo5, and 14 in 1904. Two of the cases occurred in Clapham, none in Putney, six in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 12 in Wandsworth. 10 of the cases (one in Clapham, two in Streatham, two in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth), or 40 per cent, were fatal, compared with 44 per cent, in 1906, and 44.4 per cent, in igo5- 91 Report of the Medical Officer or Health. 12 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary and four of these proved fatal. The death-rate was "031 per 1,000, compared with "035 in 1906, and '028 in 1905. The case-rate per 1,000 births was 3'5, while for the whole of London this rate was 2.1 In every case a copy of the Regulations published in the Report for 1906 was given to the nurse in attendance, or who had been in attendance before removal of the patient to the Infirmary, and in all the cases the necessary disinfection was carried out. Eleven nurses had free baths at the Disinfecting Station, Tooting. Erysipelas. 210 cases of Erysipelas were notified during the year and 10 deaths occurred. 56 of the cases and four of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 15 cases and two deaths in Putney, 37 cases and one death in Streatham, 31 cases and one death in Tooting, and 74 cases and two deaths in Wandsworth. In 1906, the number of cases notified was 273 and the deaths 10. 22 of the cases were removed to the Union Infirmary where two deaths occurred. Measles. During the year 68 deaths, 41 of males and 27 of females, were due to Measles, compared with 65 in 1906, 89 in 1905, and 104 in 1904. 15 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 11 in Putney, nine in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 20 in Wandsworth. The number of deaths is three more than in 1906, but is 38'7 under the corrected decennial average. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 20 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 40 from one to five years, and eight from five to 15 years; 88 per cent, of the deaths having occurred under five years of age. The death-rate was '21 per 1,000, compared with 21 in 1906, '31 in 1905, and -38 in 1904. The death-rate for the whole of London was 37, compared with 40 in 1906, for England and Wales 35, and for the 76 Great Towns 42 per 1,000. During the year, 1,149 visits were made by the Sanitary Inspectors in cases of Measles, 229 in Clapham, 150 in Putney, ,251 in Streatham, 240 in Tooting, and 279 in Wandsworth. The next Table shows the number of premises disinfected after Measles in each sub-district for each month of the year. The total number of premises disinfected was 955 (171 in Clapham, 105 in Putney, 235 in Streatham, 211 in Tooting, and 233 in Wandsworth), compared with 902 in 1906, 798 in 1905, and 1,115 in 1904. The greatest number of disinfections was carried out in June, this being due to outbreaks in Streatham and Tooting. The greatest number of cases occurred in April, May, June and July. In the last five months of the year the number of disinfections was small as there were very few cases in any part of the Borough with the exception of Clapham. 93 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The death-rate was "32 per 1,000, compared with '17 in igo6, and '37 for the whole of London. This disease was more prevalent in London in the year igo7 than in the previous year, and in this Borough was most prevalent in the sub-district of Wandsworth. The number of cases notified from schools was 930, compared with 549 in 1906, 362 of these were from schools in the subdistrict of Wandsworth, and the schools chiefly affected in that sub-district were Southfields, Swaffield Road, and the Wandle School. The greatest mortality from Measles and Whooping Cough occurs among children under five years of age. Of the 173 deaths that occurred from these diseases, 161 or g3 per cent, were deaths of children under five years. « Closure and Disinfecting: of Schools. During the year the following schools were closed and disinfected, or disinfected only, on account of the prevalence of either Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, or Measles, or a combination of these diseases. * (1.)

Infants' Department disinfected on the 24th December on account of an outbreak of Measles. Epidemic Influenza. 88 deaths, 38 of males and 50 of females, were due to this disease, compared with 70 in 1906, and 41 in 1905. There has thus been an increase of 18 deaths compared with the previous year, but a decrease of 1.3 compared with the corrected decennial average. 13 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, six in Putney, 23 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and 40 in Wandsworth. The death-rate was 27 per 1,000, compared with 22 in 1906, and 14 in 1905. 30 of the deaths were of persons from 25 to 65 years, and 40 cf persons over 65 years. Diarrhoea. 65 deaths, 29 of males and 36 of females, occurred from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis during the year, compared with 218 in 1906, 137 in 1905, and 208 in 1904. There has thus been a very great decrease in the number of deaths from these diseases compared with the previous year, and also compared with 215, the corrected decennial average. 10 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, six in Putney, 11 in Streatham, 28 in Tooting, and 10 in Wandsworth. In all the sub-districts the number of deaths was considerably under the number in 1906, the greatest decrease having occurred in Wandsworth, and the smallest in Tooting. In Clapham the number decreased from 31 to 10, in Putney from 16 to six, in Streatham from 38 to 11, in Tooting from 50 to 28, and in Wandsworth from 83 to 10. 99 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The death-rate was '20 per 1,000, compared with '70 in 1906. The death-rate for the whole of London also shows a marked decrease, it being only 33, compared with 95 in 1906, '72 in 1905, and 1.03 in 1904. The death-rate in the sub-districts was as follows In Clapham 15, compared with 46 in 1906; in Putney 19, compared with 54; in Streatham 11, compared with 40; in Tooting '92, compared with 74; and in Wandsworth io, cogipared with 91. Of the total number of deaths registered, 54 or 83 per cent, were of infants under one year, compared with 86 per cent, in 1906, and 87 per cent, in 1905. Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 127, compared with 289 in 1906, 203 in 1905, and 301 in 1904. Of these 127 deaths, 99 or 78 per cent, were of infants under one year. The following Table shows the number of deaths, from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under one year for the four quarters of 1907, and for the five previous years.

The proportion of deaths in this quarter to total deaths from Diarrhoea is much smaller than in previous years and was due to the fact that the mean temperature in that quarter was much under the average. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, Zymotic Enteritis, and Enteritis under one year represents 13'8 per cent, of the total mortality at that age, compared with 33 per cent, in 1906, 21.1 per cent, in 1905, and 28.8 per cent, in 1904, so that the diminution of the mortality under one year is largely due to the decrease in the number of deaths of infants from the above causes. In 76 out of the total deaths under one year, special enquiries were made, and the following Table shows the nature of the food given. TABLE XLVI1. Method of Feeding.

Out of a total of 73 where the exact nature of the food given was ascertained only eight, or 11 per cent., were nursed by the mother without the addition of any other food. In 38 or 52 per cent, of the deaths, cows' milk, either alone or with farinaceous food was given, while in 20 or 27 per cent, condensed milk alone or with farinaceous food was used. Only in two cases were patent foods given, while in three cases no information could be obtained. The next Table shows the result of the enquiries made after these deaths, arranged in Wards, and there is also shown the number of infants who had been previously visited, the number of illegitimate infants, and the social status of the parents. It is interesting to note that only four of the infants who died from Diarrhoea had been fed in accordance with the instructions given on the pamphlet left by the Inspectors, and also that of the total number visited, viz. :—73, 15 were either children born prematurely or who had been delicate from birth. 102 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This change continued throughout October, and it will be noted that the number of deaths from Diarrhoea is much above the average in the last quarter of the year, this being due to the increase in the temperature. During the year the female Sanitary Inspectors have continued the work begun in 1905, in visiting homes where births occurred and the following report gives the results of such visits and a general account of the work carried out :— "We have the honour of submitting to you a report of our visits amongst infants during 1907. "Again we were unable to widen the scope of the work, and had to limit ourselves, as in 1906, to Tooting, the poorer parts of Balham, and the Fairfield and Springfield Wards of Wandsworth. We hoped that it would have been possible to visit more mothers a second time, but, unfortunately, owing to illness, fewer re-visits have been made in Balham and Tooting. It is gratifying to be able to say that our visits have been even more warmly welcomed than last year; indeed, many mothers have told us that they were looking forward to seeing us. We have found in many instances where we visited a year or two ago that the pamphlets have been kept for future use, or lent as a valued possession to a neighbour, or even sent to friends in the country. Sometimes, too, expectant mothers have been glad of a pamphlet and a little talk with us. At the same time, we must admit, that in eight cases the pamphlets have been refused. "The total number of visits paid after notification of birth will be found in the first of our Tables, which also shows the method of feeding at the first visit, and the number of infants visited who died during the year. Fortunately the mortality during the year was lower, owing to Epidemic Diarrhoea having been less prevalent during the summer months, though Tooting still stands out as a black spot. There is an increase in the number of ineffectual visits, which is due in large measure to the necessity of so many women becoming wage-earners, owing to the distressing lack of e 2 104 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. employment among the men; in many instances we had to call four or five times before finding the mothers at home. There was a great many cases of removal, the majority of which we failed to trace, and those we did find had more often than not been obliged to seek smaller and cheaper accommodation. Wrong addresses were again a difficulty, especially in the case of illegitimate births. "The second Table shows the number of re-visits and the method of feeding the infants then found, the average age at the second visit being from four to five months. "Comparing the results of this year's enquiry with last, it will be seen that the percentage of infants having food in addition to the breast at the first visit is slightly less. In the majority of cases the 'food' meant half a nursery biscuit or a little bread while the mother was at work. At the second visit we found that many of the mothers had, on our advice, discontinued this 'food' and were giving the breast only, or cows' milk in addition. "During the summer months it is much more usual for us to find that Nestle's milk was being given as 'they were afraid of cows' milk.' With reference to 'cows' milk and food' we should state that whenever the barley water has been made from patent barley instead of pearl barley, we have regarded it as a farinaceous food. In many of the cases where the mother's milk was supplemented by other methods of feeding it was due to the fact that the mother was so poorly nourished herself as to be unable entirely to feed her baby, or that she was obliged to go to work. "We have had few instances where mothers have wilfully dried their milk supply, but one or two examples might be given. One mother said she had been a nurse, 'knew how to bring up children, and thought breast feeding was wrong.' Another 'considered the bottle was better, as it was possible to go out and leave the baby with it.' A third case has its pathos —the mother had six children under seven years of age, and the bottle was given 'because she was too busy to nurse'; she was, however, following the pamphlet given to her after the 105 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. birth of the fifth child. In the majority of cases where the breast was not being- given on the first visit, the weaning had been due to the ill-health of the mother. "We are glad to say that the use of boat bottles is largely on the increase. 290 boat bottles were used (Balham 40, Tooting 90, Fairfield 38, Springfield 122), as against 105 tube bottles (Balham 23, Tooting 44, Fairfield eight, Springfield 30). Both tube and boat bottles were being use in 14 instances (Tooting 11, Fairfield three), the tube bottles being generally given at night. On our advice boat bottles were substituted for tube in 18 cases (Balham four, Tooting nine, Fairfield one, Springfield four), and spoons were used in preference to bottles in 45 instances (Balham four, Tooting 21, Fairfield seven, Springfield 13). "Our difficulty in tracing illegitimate births was as great this year as last. In the Springfield Ward three wrong addresses were given, and though enquiries were made through the Registrar it was impossible to trace them. Eleven had removed immediately after the birth (Balham three, Tooting six, Fairfield one, Springfield one), and we could get no information as to where they had gone; three died previous to our visit, two of whom were premature. Therefore out of the 57 registered illegitimate births we were only successful in visiting 40. Of these 10 came into the Borough solely for the confinement, five from the West End of London, one from Battersea, one from Mitcham, and three from country districts. Breast feeding was more general this year, 17 being entirely breast fed on the first visit, and in one instance where the infant was having food in addition the mother had discontinued this and was giving the breast only on the second visit. Four only of those we visited died, one in Balham from Marasmus (a nurse child); two in Tooting from Bronchitis, both being in the care of the grandmother; and one in the Fairfield Ward from Diarrhoea, nursed entirely by the mother. Four only out of the 40 were delicate from birth, and of those none died ; thus again it will be seen that the majority of illegitimate children are born healthy, but the general necessity of the mothers to resume work as soon as possible after confinement is a fruitful source of danger to the children. 106 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. "With regard to the employment of midwives, out of the 1,603 mothers visited, 707 availed themselves of their services. Of these 482 employed midwives registered under the London County Council (Balham 59, Tooting 146, Southfields two, Fairfield 66, Springfield 209). The non-registered midwives were employed chiefly by the very poor (Balham 25, Tooting 88, Southfield six, Fairfield 43, Springfield 63). "Of the 1,603 infants visited by us only 20 (Tooting 13, Fairfield four, Springfield three), succumbed to Epidemic Diarrhoea this year. Other 29 deaths occurred from various causes, chiefly Bronchitis, Pneumonia, Whooping Cough, and Wasting Diseases. "The sanitary defects discovered in the course of our visits were remedied, or if involving structural work referred to you. In Balham 29 intimation notices were served, in Tooting 57, in Wandsworth 78 (Fairfield 35, Springfield 43). Four statutory notices were required in Balham, four in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth (Fairfield eight, Springfield seven)." 107 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL1X. INFANTS VISITED.

Of the 1,603 infants visited, it was found that 1,255 or 78 per cent, were breast-fed, while 348 or 22 per cent, were otherwise fed. l09 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. If we add to this the number of children where other foods were given in addition to the breast we find that the percentage is increased to 88. These percentages are almost similar to those in 1906. 94 or 5.8 per cent, were fed on cows' milk only, but 21 had in addition other food, rasing the percentage to 7.1. 37 had condensed milk only, and 13 had condensed milk and food, a total of 50, or 3'i per cent.; while nine infants were fed on farinaceous food only. With reference to the cases re-visited it was found that out of a total of 784, 507 or 64.6 per cent, were still breast fed only, compared with a percentage of 78 on the occasion of the first visit. The total number of deaths among those infants visited by the Inspectors was 49, and of these only 20 died from Diarrhoea or Enteritis. The mortality rate of those infants visited was thus only 30 per 1,000, compared with 101 per 1,000 over the whole Borough. This in itself shows that the work carried out by the Inspectors has been beneficial, and more especially if it be considered that the visits are almost wholly among the poor, among whom the infantile mortality rate is as a rule high. The following Table shows the death-rate from Zymotic Diseases for the Borough for the year as well as for the three previous years. 110 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LI.

Cancer. The total number of deaths from Cancer and other malignant diseases was 272, 93 of males and 179 of females, compared with 256 in 1906, an increase of 19, and of 5.6 compared with the corrected decennial average. The corrected death-rate was .86 per 1,000, compared with '82 in 1906, 78 in 1905, 92 in 1904, and .98 in 1903. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each sub-district was as follows:—Clapham 71 and 1.04; Putney 24 and '79; Streatham 90 and '91 ; Tooting 16 and .50; and Wandsworth 74 and .78. One of the deaths occurred at one to five years, one from five to 15 years, 158 from 25 to 65 years, and 112 over 65 years. 112 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

With regard to the increase in the rate from this disease there is no doubt that a considerable proportion of the increase is due to the increase in the age constitution and also, as the Registrar General in his decennial report remarks, to the more frequent detection of internal Cancer as a result either of operation or of post-mortem examination. Tubercular Diseases. The total number of deaths from diseases of a Tuberculous nature was 352, compared with 376 in 1906, 360 in 1905, and 380 in 1904. 261 of the deaths were due to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 41 to Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 50 to other forms of Tubercular diseases. 114 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the Lungs and other Tubercular diseases and the rates per 1,000 for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts are shown in the next Table. The corrected death-rate from Tubercular disease of the Lungs was '8i per 1,000, compared with '86 in 1906, '93 in 1905, and 1'07 in 1904; from other Tubercular diseases '28, compared with '35, '33, and '36; and from all Tubercular diseases rog, compared with 1'21, 1 '26, and 1'43- TABLE LV.

With regard to Tubercular disease of the Lungs, the rate for Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Tooting were under, and that for Wandsworth above last year's rate. From other Tubercular diseases the rate is '07 lower than in 1906, and it is also lower than the rate in the three previous years. 115 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. This rate was lowest in Streatham and highest in Tooting, and the rates for Tubercular disease of the Lungs was lowest in Putney and highest in Wandsworth. The following Table shows the death-rate per 100,000 from Tubercular disease of the Lungs for the whole Borough, and for the separate sub-districts for the year, as well as for the preceding 10 years.

The rate in Streatham, although not the lowest on record, is yet exceptionally low for a district with nearly 100,000 population, and the rate in Putney is even lower still, having been only 59 per 100,000 for the year. One death from Tubercular disease of the Lungs occurred in an infant under one year, seven in persons from one to five years, eight from five to 15 years, 54 from 15 to 25 years, 182 from 25 to 65 years, and nine over 65 years. From other Tubercular diseases 18 deaths occurred under one year, 34 from one to five years, 19 from five to 15 years, six from 15 to 25 years, nine from 25 to 65 years, and five over 63 years. 116 Report of the Mcdical Officer of Health.

Labourers and clerks again head the list as in previous years. Among females, out of 119 deaths, 25 were engaged in some occupation, 85 were widows, wives or children of labourers, artisans, workmen or clerks, while nine had no occupation. Of the 25 whose occupation was given, 11 were domestic servants, three were dressmakers, two were shop assistants, one a clerk, ont- a charwoman, one a flower-seller, one a milliner, one a nurse, one a rag and bone sorter, one a teacher, one a tailoress, and one a laundress. Voluntary Notification of Consumption. During the year 49 cases of Consumption were notified by medical practitioners, two from Clapham, two from Streatham, two from Tooting, and 43 from Wandsworth. 119 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Four of these cases were from five to 15 years of age, five from 15 to 25 years, 38 from 25 to 65 years, and two over 65 years. Of the 49 cases notified, nine were notified from the Workhouse, in one case no enquiries were made, and in one the house was empty when the Inspector called. 18 of the cases died, 12 were removed to the Infirmary or to Convalescent Homes, and one left the Borough, leaving seven on the Register at the end of the year. Of the nine cases on the Register at the end of 1906, four died in 1907, and two removed to other places, leaving only three on the Register. One case was notified from Netley Hospital, having been discharged from the Army on account of having contracted Tubercular disease of the Lungs. The total number on the Register and under observation at the end of 1907 was 11. In 17 of the 50 cases visited for the first time during the year a definite history of infection by a previous case in the family was obtained. From a numerical point of view it cannot be said that the voluntary notification of Consumption has proved a success, as out of the total number of deaths that occurred during the year, viz. :—261, only 22 had previously been notified by their medical attendant. There is little doubt, however, that the work done has in most cases proved beneficial and most satisfactory from an educational point of view. During the year disinfection was carried out at 135 premises, either after death or removal of the patient. 27 of the premises disinfected were in Clapham, 10 in Putney, 27 in Streatham, 16 in Tooting, and 55 in Wandsworth. 120 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum 76 examinations of sputum were made at the Lister Institute, three from Clapham, one from Putney, 20 from Streatham, six from Tooting, and 46 from Wandsworth. In 15 of the cases it was reported that the bacillus had been found, and in 61 that it was absent. Circulatory Diseases. From the above group of diseases 387 deaths occurred, 16S of which, 80 males and 88 females, were due to Organic diseases of the Heart. 92 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 39 in Putney, 111 in Streatham, 44 in Tooting, and 91 in Wandsworth. Of the deaths from Organic diseases of the Heart, three were from one to five years, 16 from five to 15 years, 12 from 15 to 25 years, 70 from 25 to 65 years, and 67 over 65 years. The number of deaths in 1907 was 56 more than in 1906, but is 38 under the corrected decennial average. Respiratory Diseases. The total number of deaths was 550, compared with 511 in 1906, and 512 in 1905. The number of deaths was 39 greater tnan in the previous year, but 90 less than the corrected decennial average. 109 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 49 in Putney, 124 in Streatham, 51 in Tooting, and 217 in Wandsworth. Compared with 1906 there is a decrease in Clapham and Tooting, and an increase in Putney, Streatham and Wandsworth. 121 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 176 of the deaths occurred from Acute Bronchitis, compared with 121 in 1906; 113 from Chronic Bronchitis, compared with 115; 100 from Lobar Pneumonia, compared with 130; 135 from Lobular or Broncho-Pneumonia, compared with 123; and 26 from other diseases of the Respiratory Organs, compared with 22. 158 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 66 of persons from one to five years, seven from five to 15 years, five from 15 to 25 years, no from 25 to 65 years, and 178 over 65 years. The greatest number of deaths from these diseases occurred as in previous years, among infants under one year, and persons over 65 years. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. 285 deaths, 154 of males and 131 of females, were registered as having occurred from these diseases, compared with 315 in 1906, and 317 in 1905. The number of deaths is thus 30 under last year, and is 79 under the corrected decennial average. 127 of the deaths were due to Premature birth and 158 to Developmental Diseases. 274 were of infants under one year, nine of children from one to five years, and two of persons from five to 15 years. The number of deaths from these diseases is shown more in detail in Tables XIX. to XXV., which deal with Infantile Mortality in an earlier part of this Report.

This added to the number of deaths from Puerperal Fever, viz. :— 10, gives a total of 24 deaths after childbirth, or a proportion of 3'2 per 1,000 births. In England and Wales for the year 1905, which is the latest available report, this rate was 4*20, and in the 10 years immediately preceding the average proportion had been 4'52 per 1,000 births. Of the 14 deaths one occurred in Clapham, one in Putney, five in Streatham, two in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth.

Of the 94 deaths in the Middlesex County Asylum, 13 were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 13 from Old Age, nine from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, seven from Bright's disease, two from Cancer, one from Erysipelas, one from Influenza, one from other forms of Tubercular Diseases, 33 from diseases of the Brain and Nervous System, of which 29 were from General Paralysis of the Insane, six from Apoplexy, one from Obstruction of Intestines, and seven from other causes. Of the 12 deaths in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, two were from Influenza, one from Bright's disease, one from other forms of Tubercular diseases, and eight from all other causes. Of the 10 deaths in the Prison, two were from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, one each from Enteric Fever, other forms of Tubercular diseases, Nephritis, Suicide, Execution, and three from other causes. Of the eight in the Workhouse, four were from Premature birth and Developmental diseases, two from Old Age, and one each from Pneumonia and diseases of Parturition. In other places not Institutions 59 deaths occurred, 16 of these being from Accidents, nine from Cancer, six from Suicide, two from Tubercular disease of the Lungs, two from disease of 128 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. the Heart, three from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, two from Nephritis, and 19 from all other causes. 19 of these deaths occurred in Private Nursing Homes, and four in the River Thames. Industrial Employment of Women. In May, 1907, a circular letter was received from the Home Office stating that the Secretary of State had under consideration the report of the Physical Deterioration Committee in regard to the question of further regulation of industrial employment of women before and after childbirth, but that before any decision could be arrived at as to imposing further restrictions than already exist he was of opinion that it would be necessary for enquiries to be made over a sufficiently wide area and for a sufficient period of time to enable, if possible, trustworthy conclusions to be reached. The whole subject was fully discussed at a Conference which was held at the Home Office on the 6th November, and it was then decided that the inquiry should be conducted on the lines suggested in the Home Office circular, although it was pointed out that much of the information could not at present be obtained. It was also suggested that the inquiry should commence in 1907, and I have been able to obtain some information on the matters in question from the reports of the female Sanitary Inspectors. With the exception of laundries and the Incandescent Mantle Works, there are few places in this Borough where women are industrially employed, and the following Table shows in statistical form the results of the enquiries made during the year in the places inspected. 129 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Laundry Workplaces. 150 56 52 13 11 Total 4501 1028 295 240 85 Of the total number employed 22*8 per cent, were married women between the ages of 15 and 45, 6"5 per cent, were married women over 45, and 5.3 per cent, were widows. In factory laundries the percentage of married women between 15 and 45 employed was ig'6, in other factories io'4, in laundry workshops 43'6, in other workshops 2"o, and in laundry workplaces or laundries in which only one or two women are employed 38'6. Of the 1,028 married women between 15 and 45, only 85 had infants under one year. The female Inspectors state that in making the above enquiries great difficulty was sometimes experienced in obtaining trustworthy and definite information. The proprietors and manageresses of laundries know very little about the private life of their employees. Again, there are so many women employed only occasionally that statistics will constantly vary. In dressmakers' and milliners' workrooms, the employees, who are not included in the Table given, are chiefly young girls and unmarried women, and the same may also be said of the workers in the Incandescent Mantle factories. 130 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In the Table given in the circular letter of the 10th May, there are some particulars which it is almost impossible to obtain, and which, with the staff at my disposal, could not under any circumstances be obtained. Some valuable information has, however, been procured, and this is set out in the following- Table which shows to what extent the mothers visited by the Inspectors, after a birth had occurred, during- the year were industrially employed or otherwise. 1.—Women employed industrially— Deaths under one year. Legitimate. Illegitimate. (a) In factories and workshops— Laundry hands 52 5 .... Other factory hands 10 .... .... Dressmakers 3 .... ....

School teacher 1 .... .... Telegraphist 1 .... .... No occupation 1457 32 1 1535 39 5 The infants visited by the Inspectors were children of the poor and working class, the inquiry being confined to districts containing women mainly of one social class. It will be seen, however, that in this Borough, so far as the enquiries were made, there were very few women employed industrially, only 68 out of a total of 1,603 coming under this category. 78 mothers, although not employed industrially, were engaged in some occupation, as charwomen, hawkers, or domestic servants, while 1,457 had no occupation. Among the 68 employed industrially there were five infantile deaths, while among the 78 employed as charwomen, etc., there 131 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. were 11 deaths, four of these being illegitimate, and among the 1,457 who had no occupation 33 infantile deaths occurred. The death-rate per 1,000 births among those employed industrially was 78 per 1,000, and among those not so employed only 28 per 1,000, but the numbers are so small that no definite opinion can be expressed as to whether such employment was the cause of the increased mortality. Water Supply. The following Tables, which have been abstracted from the monthly reports of the Water Examiner to the Local Government Board, show the results of the analyses of the water of the two districts supplied for each month during the year. 132 Rep0rt 0f the Medical Officer 0f Health.

The quality of the water was stated to be good in both supplies in each month of the year with the exception of January and December, when the supply was stated to be of bad or unsatisfactory quality. The Water Examiner to the Local Government Board stated in his report that a sample taken on the 17th December was the worst examined in the Government Laboratory since October and November, 1903. In the Lambeth supply a trace of free Ammonia was reported in April, June, July, November, and December, and in the Southwark supply in January and November. The Albuminoid Ammonia was high in the Lambeth supply in January, November, and December, and in the Southwark supply in January and December. The Director of Water Examinations in his report for December, 1907, states that in 1907 the raw waters contained more bacteria and bacilli coli than in 1906, but that the filtered waters, excluding samples containing 100 or more microbes per cubic centimetre, yielded about the same number of bacteria in each year, and the bacillus coli results were approximately the same. He also stated that the effect of increased storage has resulted in a decided improvement in the Southwark supply. Cutting-off Notices. During the year 91 notices with respect to 135 premises were received from the Water Board stating that the supply had been withdrawn. 49 of these notices referred to premises in the Lambeth District supply, and 42 in the Southwark District supply. 15 of the premises were in Clapham, nine in Putney, 55 in Streatham, 21 in Tooting, and 35 in Wandsworth. The supply was withdrawn for non-payment of rate from 50 premises, in 70 the premises were empty, in seven the supply was withdrawn by request, in two the cause of the supply being 135 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. drawn was not stated, in one the water was stated not to be required, and in one the premises were pulled down. Compared with 1906 there is a very large reduction in the number of premises from which the supply was withdrawn for arrears, and an increase in the number of empty premises. Mortuaries. No change has taken place in the four Mortuaries during the year. I have inspected them on several occasions and am able to report that the Regulations and By-laws made by the Council in 1905 have been in all cases complied with. The site of the new Mortuary for Wandsworth has not yet been decided on, and the matter is still under the consideration of the Public Health Committee. In Clapham 33 bodies were removed to the Mortuary, compared with 29 in 1906; in Streatham 49, compared with 35; and in Wandsworth 89, of which 49 were from Wandsworth, 13 from Putney, and 27 from Tooting; a total of 171, compared with 212 in 1906. General Sanitary Work in 1907. The following list shows the special inspections made by me during the year :— (1.) Inspection and testing of drains of non-provided schools for the certificate required by the London County Council. (a) All Saints', Putney Lower Common, Upper Grade School. Drains tested with water and certificate granted. (b) Sacred Heart Convent, Roehampton Lane. Drains tested with water. f 2 (c) Holy Trinity Schools, Trinity Road. Drains, which had been completely reconstructed, tested and certificate granted. (d) Roehampton Boys' School. Drains tested with water and certificate granted. (e) Macaulay Road Schools. Drains, which had been water tested in the year previous, re-laid, were again tested with water and certificate granted. (2.) By request of the Licensing Justices the Council instructed me to inspect and report on the following Public Houses and also to give evidence before the Compensation Committee at the Clerkenwell Sessions:— (a) "The Rose and Shamrock," 503, York Road, Wandsworth. (b) "The Gardeners' Arms," I, Gay Street, Putney. (3.) Special inspection was made of the River Graveney in consequence of several complaints as to its insanitary condition, specially in that part at back of new property in Mitcham Road, Tooting, and South Streatham. The whole of that part of the River in the Borough was inspected, but at the time of the inspection no insanitary condition was observed. Although no complaint had been received from the residents in Longley Road, Tooting, inspection was also made at that point, but the River was fairly clean, and little or no deposit existed. {4.) Complaint having been received of the insanitary condition of the ditch at the back of Ravensbury Road, Wandsworth, I made several inspections of this, and as on the occasion of my first visit I was of opinion that part of the ditch should be cleansed. Attention was called to the matter, and eventually it was cleansed out and on the subsequent visits the water was found to be clean and no nuisance could be detected. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 137 (5.) Owing to complaints of owners of property abutting on this ditch with regard to the flooding of the land in Wimbledon for the purpose of a skating lake, I again on two separate occasions inspected the neighbourhood, but I was unable to find anything which could be dealt with under the Public Health Act occasioned by the flooding of the land. Samples of the water were taken for inspection, but these were perfectly clear and inodorous. (6.) Special inspections were made of the premises where offensive trades are carried on in the Borough in consequence of the new By-laws with respect to these trades proposed by the London County Council, and which were allowed by the Local Government Board during the year. In connection specially with the ventilation of these premises, visits were made to works of a similar character in Poplar and Bermondsey, and the result of these inspections were reported to the Committee. After the By-laws were confirmed the following report was made to the Committee and a copy of this report was sent to the Local Government Board:— "27th November, 1907. "With regard to the letter of the London County Council to the Local Government Board I have to report that I have not yet seen any factory in which a dual system has been adopted where the exhaust system could not be satisfactorily applied. "The London County Council also state that failure has again and again resulted in cases where reliance has been solely placed upon extraction fans, and Messrs. Harrison & Barber's premises are mentioned. "With reference to these premises I may state that it was not until inlet fans were provided that complaints were received of offensive effluvia from these works, and on several occasions I made inspections of the premises and found that, owing to the greater amount of inlet air, there was a strong rush of air outwards from the premises whenever a door was opened. When the inlet fan was stopped it was of course necessary to open the door when the exhaust fan was working, as there was no 138 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. other inlet, but there was no nuisance caused by this to the public. The proper remedy for this, in my opinion, was to provide natural inlets of suitable size and in suitable positions. "I do not think that sufficient consideration has been given to the fact that the exhaust fan in Messrs. Harrison & Barber's is also a propulsion fan, and that it has to force the air through a furnace for the purpose of destroying the offensive effluvia. "This obstruction lessens very greatly the theoretical amount of work done by the fan, and as there was no obstruction in the case of the inlet fans the result was that the air in the chamber was in a state of compression and escaped into the open air by any crevices or open doors. "With regard to the Report of the Departmental Committee I have been unable to find in that Report any reference to the double system, except in the case of cleaning by benzole, where the conditions are very different. "The conclusions of this Committee in fact, support my contention that exhaust fans with dirigible currents are far the most satisfactory, both for the worker and for the purpose of obviating any public nuisance. "I would refer the Committee to page 40 (fourth Section) which is as follows:— "'It should clearly be noted that the incoming air is not blown in through the air shaft H, but in reality is sucked in by the operation of the fans Z Z; for these powerful fans, having to derive all their supply of air from that in the room, tend to set up a partial vacuum, which can only be satisfied by means of inlets of corresponding capacity; and inasmuch as the inlets are purposely restricted to the channels above described, all the air entering the building can Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 139 be controlled in amount and steered in direction. The dirigible currents thus set up are made good use of at points where the dust is thickest—as above and behind the comb E for instance. The dust that would otherwise ascend and mingle with the general air is immediately caught up by a definite blast ot air from the spout G, which at once carries it across to the grating F, then to be swept away by exhaust current P to X and Z. This use of a dirigible blast in conjunction with a local exhaust appears to be highly successful; a success that suggests a wide field of utility in other directions. " 'It will be noticed that for the supply of air to those near an external wall the air can be brought in either direct from the outside on the Tobin-tube principle (see arrows in pipe A) or through a shaft fitted with a tempering coil as at H. " 'The window inlets (B) can be held in reserve for the warmest weather, and even then should only be used where short circuiting can be avoided.' "This system is shown diagrametically as applied in flax heckling shops, but there is no scientific objection to the same system being applied successfully in any manufacture producing offensive effluvia." With reference to the houses in The Platt, Putney, mentioned in my Report for 1906, several adjournments were agreed to as there were legal difficulties in the way of the owner with respect to the lease of land in front of the houses. The matter, however, was finally dealt with by the magistrate on the 14th October, and a closing order made. This order was complied with by the owner and the houses are now empty. Several inspections were made during the year before this closing order was made. (8.) Owing to complaints from the agents of Cavendish Gardens, Deauville Mansions, and Deauville Court, Clapham, as to a more frequent removal of house refuse, an inspection was 140 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. made of these properties for the purpose of ascertaining if any other system than a removal twice a week would be desirable. I reported that, in my opinion, it was necessary for the owners to provide additional dust bins, and that these should be placed further from the flats. Notices were served for additional dust bins and these notices were complied with by the owners. Since these were provided, no further complaint has been made. (9.) Special inspections were again made of the houses known as Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, Jubilee Cottages, reported to the Council in 1906, but the owner voluntarily closed them in preference to complying with the sanitary notices. Four other houses had been previously closed by the owner owing to their insanitary condition. (10.) Special house-to-house inspection was made of the houses in Foss Road, Hazelhurst Road, and Smallwood Road, and notices were served on the owners for the defects found. All of these notices were complied with, and 1 am able to report that the houses in these streets are now in a more satisfactory condition. (11.) Special inspection was made of the land in Merton Road, the property of the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Co., with regard to the condition of the soil on that portion previously reported on by me to ascertain if such report could be modified as far as the prohibition of building thereon was concerned. I advised the owners that the offensive organic matter would require to be removed completely, but the matter is still under their consideration. (12.) Special inspections were made of the brickfield, Lonesome, in consequence of reports that house refuse was being deposited there which was to be used for brick-making after being sifted. Notice was served on the occupier, and the practice was discontinued. (13.) Numerous inspections were made of several mews and passages during the year. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 141 (a) Complaint was made of the condition of passage off Becmead Avenue, Streatham, in rear of Nos. 152 to 170, Streatham High Road, and on inspection it was found that this passage was in an insanitary condition. Notices have been served to abate this, and the matter is now being considered by the owners who have agreed to remedy the same. (b) The passage at rear of shops Nos. 42 to 62, Brook- wood Road, has also been inspected and notices served. The passage was cleansed, but no paving done. (c) The passage in Emmanuel Road, at side and rear of Nos. 120 to 142 has also been inspected and notices have been served, but owing to difficulty in obtaining the owners under the Public Health Act, no structural work has yet been carried out, although the passage has been kept clean. (d) Inspection was also made of passage in rear of Nos. 137 to 151, High Street, Putney, and the Council is at present in communication with the owners with regard to the proper paving of the same. (e) In course of inspection in Foss Road, my attention was directed to the passage at rear of Nos. 14 to 76, and between that road and Blackshaw Road. During the current year this passage will be dealt with by serving notice on the responsible owners. Serious difficulties have arisen with respect to the ownership of these passages, as in most cases they are merely rights of way and not owned by the lessees of the property abutting thereon. (14) Inspections were also made of yards in rear of Wardley Street, Wandsworth; Burnbury Road, Midmoor Road, Haverhill Road, and Acre Square, Clapham, and the necessary notices served. These notices have been or are being complied with. 142 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (15.) Special inspections were also made this year of several localities in consequence of complaints of smell from sewer ventilators. These complaints were not so numerous this year as in 1906, doubtless due to climatic conditions. In all 122 complaints were received, nine from Clapham North Ward, 11 from Clapham South Ward, 12 from Putney, 20 from Streatham, 19 from Balham, six from Tooting, 21 from Southfield, none from Fairfield, and 24 from Springfield. All these complaints were forwarded to the Surveyors, who reported that in every case the necessary cleansing and flushing or other work had been carried out. (16.) In September I reported to the Public Health Committee that I had inspected the River Wandle at the outfall of the Croydon Rural Sewage Farm and that I was of opinion that the effluent was offensive, and the Committee instructed me to take samples of the effluent for analysis. This was done on the 23rd September, and the report of the Analyst showed that this effluent was sewage that had undergone no purification. The sample gave the following results:— Free and saline Ammonia 2.352 grains per gallon. Albuminoid Ammonia 01575 » „ Oxygen absorbed at 8o° F.— In 15 minutes 0.5181 „ „ In 4 hours 0.8818 „ „ Nitric Nitrogen None Chlorine 5.3 „ „ Total solid matter 44.1 „ „ The attention of the Thames Conservancy and the Croydon Rural District Council was called to the matter, and the latter stated in reply that their records to some extent confirmed the report of this Council's Analyst. The reason for the impurity of the effluent was, it was stated, because certain experimental works were being carried out in connection with the temporary working of the filters. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 143 A letter was also received from the Thames Conservancy stating that the Conservators had decided to serve a notice under the provisions of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894, requiring the discontinuance of the pollution of the River, and that such notice had been served. The Council has instructed me to take further samples during the present year. In addition to the above special inspections, and the routine inspections of bakehouses, slaughterhouses, cowsheds, and offensive trade premises, 360 inspections were made of other premises, chiefly previous to the service of statutory notices. My attendance was necessary at the Police Court on 13, and at the Licensing Sessions on two occasions during the year. Revenue Act. During the year nine certificates were granted under the above Act and four refused. The certificates granted referred to 54 houses or 121 separate tenements, and the four refused to 10 houses or 22 tenements. Sanitary Operations. The Table of Sanitary Operations shows in detail the amount and nature of the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. The number of complaints received and attended to was 1,836, compared with 1,595 in 1906, and 1,357 in 1905. There was again an increase in both wards in Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Southfield Ward, Wandsworth, and a decrease in Balham, Tooting, Springfield and Fairfield Wards, Wandsworth. 13 of these complaints were made to the London County Council, and these were all at once attended to. 144 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of houses and premises inspected was 24,230, a slight decrease compared with the previous year when 24,458 inspections were made. There was an increase in the number of houses and premises inspected in Clapham North and South, Putney, Balham, Southfield, and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Streatham, Tooting and Fairfield Wards. The total number of house-to-house inspections made was 5,718, compared with 5,686 in 1906, 6,290 in 1905, and 6,440 in 1904. There has been an increase in the number of house-to-house inspections in the Clapham North, Streatham, Southfield, Fairfield, and Springfield Wards, and a decrease in Clapham South, Putney, Balham, and Tooting Wards. The decrease in these inspections was due to the increase in the number of cases of infectious diseases and complaints, and more especially is this the case in Tooting Ward. In Streatham also, although there was a slight increase in the number of houseto-house inspections, yet the total number was only 281. I have brought this matter to the notice of the Committee, and the question of increasing the number of Sanitary Inspectors is at present under consideration.

The total number of intimation notices served was 7,613, compared with 7,500 in 1906, and of statutory notices 1,106, compared with 1,044. The greatest number of intimation notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Southfield and Streatham Wards. The greatest number of statutory notices was served in Balham and Springfield Wards, and the smallest number in Putney and Southfield Wards. Only 38 of the statutory notices served in 1907 were not complied with. These were served in December and were complied with in the early months of the current year. The number of statutory notices served include By-law notices, 391 of which were served in respect of the following contraventions of the By-laws:—Yard paving 134, repairs to water closets 69, repairs to flushing apparatus of water closets 64, covers to cisterns 57, cleansing cisterns 31, cleansing house and other contraventions of the By-laws as to houses let in lodgings 33, paving and draining stables, one, depositing offensive liquid on street, one, and depositing house refuse within prohibited distance, one. The number of cases of overcrowding dealt with during the year was 87, compared with 100 in 1906, and 92 in 1905. Five of these were in Clapham, five in Putney, 19 in Streatham, eight in Tooting and 50 in Wandsworth. Of the 19 cases in Streatham, seven were in Hazelhurst, Foss and Selkirk Roads, and in Wandsworth the cases were chiefly in Pier Terrace, Jews' Row, Warple Way, Lydden Road, and Wardley Street. 1,099 ashpits were provided or repaired, compared with 1,219 in 1906, and 1,128 in 1905, and 396 complaints with reference to the non-removal of house refuse (43 from Clapham, 55 from Putney, 161 from Streatham, 25 from Tooting, and 112 from Wandsworth), were received during the year. These complaints were as in previous years attended to by the Dusting Inspectors. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 159 Removal of Mouse Refuse. In all the sub-districts the house refuse is removed weekly, and this removal has been carried out in a satisfactory manner, the number of complaints, considering the large number of houses in the Borough, having been very small. In some flats in the Borough by special arrangement the house refuse is removed twice a week, but there are a few flats, specially those in Venn Street, Clapham, from which, owing to absence of any suitable position for the dust bin, it would be advisable, from a sanitary point of view, to remove the refuse more frequently than twice a week. This, however, could only be secured by the cordial cooperation of the tenants, and enquiries which have been made do not lead me to believe that this could be easily obtained. No change has taken place in the method of disposal, particulars of which have been given in former reports. During the 12 months ending March, 1907, 12,372 tons were sent by rail, an increase of 943 tons compared with 1906; 17,905 tons were disposed of in the Destructor, a decrease of 1,690 tons; and 23,259 tons were barged, an increase of 1,097 tons; a total of 53,536 tons, compared with a total of 53,546 tons in 1906. The total cost of collection and disposal for the above period was £17,076. 130 statutory notices were served under Section 37 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide ashpits in accordance with the By-laws, and these notices were complied with. 1,084 yards in connection with dwelling houses, and 84 in connection with stables were paved, drained or cleansed, compared with 1,094 and 68 in 1906. 5,456 rooms and 945 staircases and passages were cleansed or repaired, compared with 4,954 rooms and 1,038 staircases in 160 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1906. The greatest number of rooms cleansed was in the Balham Ward, where 1,305 were done, and in Springfield Ward, where 1,073 were done, and the smallest number in Streatham and Southfield Wards. 1,130 drains were cleansed or repaired and 101 rain-water pipes disconnected from the drains. 167 notices of reconstruction of drains were sent to the Surveyors from this Department: 25 in Clapham, compared with 33 in 1906; five in Putney, compared with 22; 70 in Streatham, compared with 77;12 in Tooting, compared with eight; and 55 in Wandsworth, compared with 45. The total number of houses where the drains were reconstructed during the year was 378, 87 in Clapham, 20 in Putney, 138 in Streatham, 31 in Tooting, and 102 in Wandsworth. 266 accumulations of manure were removed after service of notice, compared with 253 in 1906, 47 in Clapham, 35 in Putney, 120 in Streatham, 32 in Tooting, and 32 in Wandsworth. There has been an increase in the number of cases dealt with in Clapham and Streatham, and a decrease in Putney, Tooting and Wandsworth. 33 notices were served for the periodical removal of the manure every 48 hours, compared with 16 in 1906, and 20 in 1905. Owing to the fact that horse manure is the chief breeding material for the ordinary house fly, this removal should be carried out regularly and thoroughly. For this purpose frequent inspections have been made of all stables in the Borough, and many accumulations, not of such a serious nature as those in which notices were necessary, have been removed on the request of the Sanitary Inspectors. More frequent removal of this manure and more efficient cleansing of stables and stable yards, will, in my opinion, effect a desirable diminution in the number of house flies, and a consequent decrease in the deaths of infants from diseases of the digestive system due to pollution of milk and other foods. i6i Report of the Mcdical Officer of Health. The number of water closets cleansed and repaired was 1,809, compared with 1,936 in 1906, and 2,141 in 1905. The reason of the diminution in the numbers is that owners of property are erecting a much more desirable type of waste water preventing cistern, and that the pattern of water closet pan now used is more easily cleansed. 743 drinking water cisterns were cleansed, covered or repaired, 213 in Clapham, 18 in Putney, 163 in Streatham, 56 in Tooting, and 293 in Wandsworth, compared with 842 in 1906. 143 premises were inspected and notices served where animals were kept in such a manner as to be a nuisance. Nine of these were in Clapham, 11 in Putney, 33 in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 80 in Wandsworth. This nuisance was again most common in Fairfield and Springfield Wards, Wandsworth, and the animals kept were chiefly ducks and hens. 60 smoke nuisances were reported during the year, three in Clapham, five in Putney, 12 in Streatham, six in Tooting, and 34 in Wandsworth. Proceedings were taken in three cases during the year. In one a fine of 40s. was inflicted and 2s. costs, in the other two cases orders were made for the abatement of the nuisance with 6s. costs. 11 complaints of black smoke were received from the Public Control Department of the London County Council with regard to 14 premises, and 13 complaints from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society with regard to 25 premises. These complaints were all at once attended to and the premises kept under observation. 184 soil pipes were repaired, 15 in Clapham, 22 in Putney, 99 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 43 in Wandsworth, compared with 185 in 1906, and 175 in 1905. 812 leaky roofs and gutters were repaired, compared with 934 in 1906. 162 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 56 unwholesome or dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, five in Clapham, nine in Putney, eight in Streatham, 14 in Tooting, and 20 in Wandsworth, compared with 80 in 1906. The number of unclassified nuisances was 758, 251 in Clapham, 90 in Putney, 130 in Streatham, 109 in Tooting, and 178 in Wandsworth, compared with 893 in 1906. Disinfection. The total number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of cases of infectious disease was 3,206 (537 in Clapham, 277 in Putney, 790 in Streatham, 650 in Tooting, and 952 in Wandsworth), compared with 2,794 in 1906, and 2,947 in 1905. The increase was due to the increase in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever. 1,948 lots of bedding were stoved at the Disinfecting Station, compared with 1,669 in 1906, and 1,778 in 1905. The 1,948 lots of bedding included the following:—1,274 beds, 1,336 bolsters, 3,219 pillows, 1,413 mattresses, 702 palliasses, 2,518 sheets, 1,973 quilts, 965 cushions, 7,796 articles of clothing, 3,626 blankets, 444 carpets, and 3,836 extra articles, a total of 29,102 articles, compared with 28,885 in 1906, and 30,477 in 1905. 955 premises were disinfected after Measles, and 135 after Tubercular disease of the Lungs, compared with 902 and 134 in 1906. 20 beds, nine bolsters, 31 pillows, 36 mattresses, 53 palliasses, 11 sheets, nine quilts, 15 cushions, 60 articles of clothing, 14 blankets, 15 carpets, and 134 extra articles, were removed and destroyed by request of the owners during the year. Disinfection was also carried out by the Sanitary Staff at premises after non-notifiable diseases, chiefly Cancer, and the sum of £25 17s. 10d. was received for such disinfection. 163 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The disinfection by steam was carried out at the Station at Tooting, and I am pleased to report that this Station has proved most satisfactory in every way. I have regularly visited the Station during the year, and am able to report that the work has been carried out by the staff to my entire satisfaction. The approximate cost of working and maintaining the Disinfecting Station during the past year, includingthe cost of disinfectants used in fumigating and cleansing rooms, was as follows :— £ s. d. Wages 917 17 4 Fuel 12 13 7 Horse Hire 121 1 0 Stores, Tools, and other materials 62 8 2 Repairs to Horse Vans and Harness 12 0 9 Disinfectants, etc. 41 11 10 Repairs to Motor Van 43 2 0 Motor Running Expenses 55 16 6 Lighting 2 18 4 Insurance 9 6 8 Water 4 16 1 £1,283 12 3 The number of lots of bedding stoved was 1,948. Cost per lot of bedding 13s. 2d. Cleansing of Persons Act. The baths at the Disinfecting Station have been more used this year, chiefly owing to the number of verminous children dealt with. The names of 90 children were communicated to me by the Medical Officer, Education Department, London County Council, and the homes were visited by the Inspectors. In the majority of cases only the heads of the children were verminous, but in a 164 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. siderable number the bodies and clothing were also verminous. Of these latter, 30, 18 boys and 12 girls, were cleansed at the baths, and the clothing was at the same time stoved with beneficial results. Three verminous adults, two males and one female, had baths, and their clothing disinfected. Inspection of Urinals in connection with Licensed Premises. There are in the Borough 106 urinals in connection with licensed premises, the majority of which are open to the public, and 211 inspections of these were made. In 20 cases it was necessary to serve notices for cleansing and these were complied with. Police Court Proceedings. The list which follows shows particulars of Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, during the year. The total amount of fines inflicted was £99 8s. 6d., and the costs £14 6s. 5d., compared with £55 18s. and £21 3s. in 1906. The amount received by the Council in fines shows an increase, owing to the fine of £50 inflicted in a case of exposure for sale of meat which was unfit for human food, and in a nuisance case where a fine of £10 was inflicted. 165 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the year 981 inspections were made of these premises and 42 notices, chiefly for cleansing, were served. Special attention has again been given this year to the enforcing of the Milkshop Regulations, and the notice of all registered purveyors of milk was called to the regulations which deal with the protection of milk against infection or contamination. 169 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

There were 21 Slaughter-houses and one Knacker's Yard on the Register in 1906, one in Putney was removed, leaving 21 on the Register. During the year 361 inspections were made of these, but it was only necessary to serve two notices for cleansing. The usual cleansing was carried out by the occupiers at the proper times. During the year the Inspectors inspected the carcases of 146 cattle, 882 sheep, 57 pigs, and 19 calves in Slaughter-houses. The following list shows the number of Slaughter-houses licensed by the London County Council in October, 1907 :— Clapham— Masters, Albert, 63, Clapham Park Road, Clapham. Jarworth, William, 140, Clapham Park Road, Clapham.

Ice Cream Premises. At the end of 1906 there were 229 of these on the Register. During 1907 36 were added and 30 removed, leaving a total of 235 on the Register. 323 inspections were made of these premises during the year and 39 notices were served, all of which were for cleansing. Houses Let in Lodgings. At the end of 1906 there were 218 houses let in lodgings on the Register. Eleven were added during 1907, making a total of 229 on the Register at the end of 1907. 513 inspections of these were made during the year, and 376 notices were served, 14 for overcrowding and 362 for other conditions, chiefly cleansing. With regard to five premises prosecutions were taken for failing to cleanse, and convictions were obtained in each case. No difficulties have arisen during the year in carrying out these By-laws, and I am able to report that all these premises have been kept in much better condition since being placed on the Register. Offensive Trade Refuse. The arrangement entered into by the Council in 1904 for the removal of the above by a contractor still continues to work satisfactorily. No complaints have been received during the year in this Department as to the methods adopted. Unsound Food. During the year one box of Cod Roes, three cases of Herrings, 14 boxes of Haddocks, two boxes of Kippers, one box of Soles, two trunks of Mixed Fish, one bushel of Winkles, three boxes of Tomatoes and 24 lbs. of Walnuts, were destroyed at the request of the owners and the usual certificates granted. 174 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Factories and Workshops. I am again able to report that there has been an increase in the amount of work carried out during the year, and this increase would have been greater had it not been for the illness of some of the staff. No difficulties have been experienced during the year in carrying out the Act, although in regard to the lists of outworkers it was necessary to issue a circular to a large proportion of those employing outworkers, requesting the lists to be forwarded. The Tables which follow are similar to those used in previous Reports, and the whole of the work done by both male and female Inspectors is there summarised in a concise form. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,771, including 159 retail bakehouses, 114 workshop laundries, and 1,498 other workshops, but not including 285 factories, 935 workplaces, and 290 outworkers' premises. Including all factories, workshops, workplaces, and outworkers' premises, there were on the Register at the end of 1907 3,281 premises, compared with 3,096 in 1906, 3,045 in 1905, 2,987 in 1904, and 2,676 in 1903. The total number of inspections made during the year was 6,048, compared with 5,997 in 1906, 4,933 in 1905, and 4,946 in 1904. The total number of notices served was 453, 411 intimation and 42 statutory, compared with 427 in 1906, 462 in 1905, and 465 in 1904. There were four prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, three for the emission of black smoke, and one for sanitary defects. Under the head of other workshops are included domestic workshops, and under the head of places where food is prepared for sale are included the kitchens of hotels, restaurants, tripe, fried fish and eel shops, and other places where food is prepared for sale. 175 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all 683 inspections were made of 285 factories, and 50 notices, 48 intimation and two statutory, were served. The total number of workshops on the Register was 1,771, 114 of which were workshop laundries, 159 workshop bakehouses, and 1,498 other workshops. In all 3,148 inspections of these were made, compared with 3,233 in 1906, and 2,628 in 1905, and 206 intimation and 30 statutory notices were served. The total number of workplaces on the Register was 935, and 1,868 inspections were made, while 126 intimation and 10 statutory notices were served. The total number of defects found was 545, including eight cases in which there was a breach of special sanitary requirements for bakehouses, compared with 558 and 19 in 1906. To abate these nuisances 380 intimation and 42 statutory notices were served, all of which, with the exception of 12 were complied with at the end of the year. The 12 outstanding were complied with, with one exception, in the first month of this year. The one exception was a case where there was insufficient water closet accommodation, but the occupier having reduced the number of employees, the notice could not be insisted on. In all 545 defects were found and 532 remedied, but only 380 intimation notices were served, as one notice frequently called attention to several defects on the same premises. 176 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

It is intended to provide for uniformity in the presentation of such particulars as lend themselves to statistical treatment:— Factories, Workshops, Laundries, Workplaces and Homework. TABLE LXXVII.

The Table which follows has been slightly altered from the Table in the Report for 1906, in that the outworkers are subdivided into Contractors and Workers. There has been a large increase in the number of lists and the number of outworkers, this being due to the inclusion this year of a large number of boot repairers and tailors working for retail shops in the Borough. In all 130 lists were received twice in the year, containing the names and addresses of 45 contractors and 387 workers, and 18 lists once in the year, containing the names of one contractor and 44 workers. The majority of those forwarding lists only once a year were persons who did not employ outworkers during the six months previous to February or previous to August. The total number of addresses of outworkers received from other Councils was 322, compared with 173 in 1906, and 146 in 1905, and 325 addresses were forwarded to other Councils, compared with 122 in 1906, and 231 in 1905. The following are the districts to which lists of outworkers were forwarded, and also the number of outworkers :—Lambeth 76, Battersea 75, Stepney 53, Croydon 23, Camberwell 18, Southwark 11, Fulham and City of London 10 each, Chelsea six, Wimbledon, Hammersmith and East Ham four each, Bermondsey, St. Pancras, and Westminster three each, Basingstoke, Hackney, Bethnal Green, Ilford, Stoke Newington, Finsbury, and Poplar two each, and Shoreditch, Islington, Barnes, Coombe and Maiden, Stratford, Chiswick, Merton and Hampstead, one each. At the end of 1906 there were 233 outworkers' premises on the Register, 127 were added and 70 removed during the year, leaving 290 on the Register. 349 inspections were made of these premises during the year, and 31 notices, all for cleansing, were served and complied with. During the year six cases of infectious disease were notified as having occurred in the homes of outworkers, compared with six in 1906, and five in 1905. 180 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of lists (received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act) and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. They will, therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 181 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The Table shows the work done in each sub-district and is grouped under five divisions: (1) factories, (2) workshops, (3) domestic workshops, (4) workplaces, and (5) outworkers' premises. The total number of inspections was 2,408, compared with 1,964 in 1906, and 2,023 in 1905 and re-inspections 1,298, compared with 1,649 and 1,222. 864 of the inspections and 130 of the re-inspections were in Clapham, 271 and 558 in Putney, 510 and 183 in Streatham, 146 and 64 in Tooting, and 617 and 363 in Wandsworth. Seven workshops where males were employed were notified to H.M. Inspector, and 28 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. All of these were already on the Workshop Register and had been inspected. TABLE LXXX II. Clapham. Putney. Streatham Tooting. Wandsworth. Total.

The Tables which follow summarise the work done during the year by the female Sanitary Inspectors. The total number of premises inspected was 1,994 (464 in Clapham, 254 in Putney, 541 in Streatham, 104 in Tooting, and 631 in Wandsworth). 158 inspections were made of factories, 1,116 of workshops, 77 of domestic workshops, 478 of workplaces, and 165 of outworkers' premises, while 281 premises were visited for enquiry and no workroom found. There were only four cases of overcrowding discovered, compared with five in 1906, 12 in 1905, and 17. in 1904, and these were at once abated. 13 were insufficiently ventilated, and 66 were found to be in a dirty condition. In every workshop inspected there were separate water closets for the sexes, but in seven factories and nine workshops the water closets were defective. Other nuisances were discovered in seven factories, 34 workshops, two domestic workshops, fifty workplaces, and eight outworkers' premises, and these have all been abated. It was only necessary to serve 123 intimation and nine statutory notices, and these were all complied with. It was not necessary to take any proceedings during the year. 49 workshops and two domestic workshops where females were employed were reported to H.M. Inspector of Workshops, and 103 were reported to this Council by H.M. Inspector. Only 20 of the workshops reported by H.M. Inspector were unknown to the Sanitary Inspectors. The others had been previously reported by me, or were already on the Register. 186 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE LXXX1V. Clapham. Putney. Streatham. Tooting.

There has been a slight diminution compared with 1906, the number of dressmakers' premises, of workshop laundries, and workplaces having decreased owing to either dullness of trade, removal, or conversion of workshop laundries into factories. The total number of trades carried on in the Borough does not coincide with the number of workshops and workplaces, as in many instances several trades are carried on in the same premises. 190 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the past year 989 samples of foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, compared with 905 in 1906, and 853 in 1905. Of these, 84 or 8.49 per cent. were reported to be adulterated, compared with 9.2 per cent. in 1906, and 7.6 per cent. in 1905. The percentage of milk samples found to be adulterated was 10.97, compared with 10.26 in 1906, and 7.2 in 1905. It is necessary, however, to point out that out of the 55 cases of adulterated milk reported during the year, in 25 the Public Health Committee, after consideration of the amount of adulteration and the circumstances under which the milk was sold, decided that no action should be taken against the vendors, so that while the percentage of adulterated samples of milk detected was higher than in former years, the percentage of prosecutions fell to 5.9. In 52 cases out of the 84 in which adulterations were detected proceedings were instituted against the vendor, compared with 59 cases in 1906. The total amount received in penalties under the above Acts during the year amounted to £131, and the costs to £36 4s., making a total of £167 4s., compared with £140 12s. in 1906. 192 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

By these figures it would appear that the food supply of the Borough has only slightly improved. I am, however, convinced that far less adulteration is actually practised at the present time than was the case a few years ago. The methods adopted in procuring samples are continually being altered, and the varied assistance which the Inspector has at his disposal has aided him considerably in the detection of offenders. The system which has been adopted by the Council of allowing the Inspector to provide his own assistants still works admirably and economically. No less than 10 different assistants, including four women, have been engaged at various times during the past year. He also keeps in constant communication with the Food Inspectors in adjoining Boroughs, and thus both gives and receives much valuable information respecting suspicious traders. 197 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of samples taken in each sub-district of the Borough, together with the average per 1,000 of population, the number of adulterations detected, and the percentage of adulteration.

In every instance where a sample is taken at a Public Institution the Analyst submits the figures of analysis and this is forwarded to the public body concerned. In this way the Public Institutions are not only protected against actual adulteration, but the responsible officials are kept informed of the quality of the article which is being supplied under their contracts. This is a practice which should prove of great service to public bodies, more particularly to those who adopt a standard of their own in their contracts. For instance, such an one is the Metropolitan Asylums Board, where the standard adopted for milk is 3.3 per cent. of milk fat. h 198 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Samples are frequently taken at their various hospitals in the Borough, and occasionally the report of the Analyst is to the effect that the milk supplied contained only 3 per cent. of milk fat, this being the minimum percentage allowed by the Board of Agriculture. It is impossible for the Local Authority to proceed against the retailers in these cases, but the officials of such a body being notified it is always open for them to take any action against the vendors which they may deem necessary. Of the five samples taken at private houses during the year at the request of the occupiers, three were of butter, and two of milk, and of the samples so taken the three of butter and one of the milk were found to be adulterated. It is significant to note that no less than 80 per cent. of the samples taken at private houses were found on analysis to be adulterated. This fully proves the reports which I am constantly receiving as to the wary methods adopted by the fraudulent trader. The methods adopted are as follows :—a genuine article is delivered for weeks until the buyer is thoroughly established as a customer, and the suspicion of such private resident being an assistant of the Inspector is allayed, and then an adulterated article is substituted. I am fully convinced that this practice is adopted to a greater extent than is generally supposed, and it is only by residents coming forward and reporting suspected cases and being willing to support the officers of the Council in any subsequent proceedings which may be instituted at the Police Court that it is possible for them to suppress it. The following Table gives the results of the analyses of the samples taken at the various railway stations, Public Institutions, and private houses, and the percentage of adulterations in each case.

Eight of these samples were reported to be adulterated, this being a percentage of 7.1, compared with 7.08 per cent. in 1906, and 8.7 per cent. in 1905. The following Table shows the number of milk, butter, coffee, and other samples submitted for analysis, and the number and percentage of adulteration detected in each class.

These samples were in the majority of instances demanded in the public 200 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. thoroughfares. The deputies employed have no legal right to demand a sample and were they to be sent in advance, leaving the Inspector concealed some hundred to two hundred yards away, if the vendor of an adulterated article had the slightest suspicion that it was to be supplied for analysis, in all probability the can containing it would be "accidentally" overturned, as has happened on more than one occasion. No proceedings for refusal to serve could then be instituted, whereas if such a circumstance occurred when the Inspector himself demanded a sample the contrary would be the case. Several cases of fraud have come under my notice during the past year which are of special interest. In the early part of the year information was received that a considerable amount of margarine was being supplied as butter to a large firm in the Borough where the assistants lived in. I therefore instructed the Inspector to visit the shop of the vendor and purchase a sample of butter by deputy and submit it for analysis. This was done and the sample was reported to be genuine. The next step taken was for a private sample to be sent by the consignee to the Analyst. This was done and proved as suspected to contain 96 per cent. margarine. Arrangements were made for the Inspector to attend at the place of delivery at the time the butter usually arrived and to take a sample. Upon the arrival of the consignor's servant to deliver the butter (which was contained in two separate packages—both of which were in wrappers on which was printed "Pure Butter"), a sample was taken from each and submitted for analysis. The Analyst's report showed both samples were adulterated with 96 per cent. of margarine. From the information received in this case I am convinced that this fraud had been existing for some considerable period, and although previous convictions had already been recorded against the consignor in this case, the amount of the fine inflicted was only£5 on each of the two summonses. 201 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Again, the Inspector visited a small general shop where milk is retailed and obtained a sample which on analysis was certified to be deficient in milk fat to the extent of 33 per cent. Upon the receipt of the certificate, the Inspector, in the interests of justice, and knowing the reputation of the wholesale man, saw the shopkeeper and arranged to take a sample on delivery. The Analyst reported this sample to be deficient in milk fat to the extent of 28 per cent. The wholesale man was summoned and although in this case again previous convictions were proved, the fine inflicted was only £2. Another case of an itinerant butter vendor has occurred during the year, the circumstances of which are worthy of note as tending to show the scanty help, or rather the reverse—the opposition—which the Inspector meets with in the execution of his duties. One of the female assistants employed reported that an itinerant butter vendor was in the habit of delivering butter at a certain house in the Borough. Having ascertained his regular time for calling the woman deputy ingratiated herself with the occupier of the house and asked to be allowed to wait until her butterman called in order that she might buy some also. Upon his arrival she purchased half-a-pound (the Inspector being meanwhile concealed in the kitchen). When the officer came forward and went through the necessary formalities and proceeded to divide and seal the sample, both he and his assistant were abused for using this particular resident's house as a "spying-place," and this by the very person who was being systematically imposed upon. This sample was adulterated with 76 per cent. margarine. In connection with the milk trade I have to report a continuous increase in a very undesirable class of trader, viz. : the vendor of "cheap" milk, not the traditional milk and water man, but the man with two kinds of milk for sale, new milk and what he is pleased to call "hand skimmed milk." I am of opinion that much of this mixture of "whole and separated milk" (which is the true composition of the article with, needless to say, the minimum of "whole" and the maximum of separated milk), is foisted upon the 202 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. public, more particularly in the poorer localities for genuine new milk, and is undoubtedly the cause of much malnutrition in young children of the poor, not only in this Borough but in every Borough in the Metropolis. The Inspector reports to me that milk sellers of this character have increased in the Borough by something like 50 per cent. He is fully' alive to his responsibility in suppressing this class of tradesman, but his ingenuity is taxed very considerably, so much so is this the case that he has reported to me on many occasions during the year that it is a well-nigh impossible task unless assisted by private householders, which help, as I have already pointed out, is most difficult to obtain. The only thing which can be done pending further legislation on this important phase of the milk question is to take samples from these sellers on every possible occasion, even at the risk of a charge of persecution. I have also to report that in only three cases during the year have summonses been dismissed owing to the "warranty defence" being pleaded. Three summonses were issued against milk sellers for refusing to sell a sample to the Inspector on demand, two for obstructing him in the execution of his duty, and one against a vendor for not having his name and address legibly inscribed on his vehicle. Of the 13 samples of meats taken, and which are specified in the Analyst's Report, eight or 61.5 per cent. were reported to contain boric acid as a preservative. In three of these cases proceedings were instituted against the vendors where the quantity was considered to be injurious to health, viz. : 20 grains per pound and over, but in only one case was a conviction obtained. There is always considerable difficulty in obtaining convictions in these cases owing to the great difference of opinion as to how far the use of preservatives is necessary and to what extent it is injurious to health. Having regard to the large number of articles of food in common use to which preservatives are added, it becomes necessary to take an increasing number of samples of such foods. This certainly acts in many instances as a deterrent, notably in the case of local manufacturers of sausages and potted meat. In my opinion, however, the use of preservatives of any kind should be prohibited by law unless there be attached to the article of food 203 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. thus preserved a label upon which is stated the nature of the preservative and the maximum amount used. If this were done and it was found that the article contained other preservative than that stated or in an excessive amount, then it should be made to constitute an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.
