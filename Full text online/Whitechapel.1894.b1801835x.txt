WHI 2 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS), FOR THE YEAR 1894, (consisting of 52 weeks), being the ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT, by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH; diplomate in public health, university of cambridge; fellow of the incorporated society of medical officers of health ; associate of the college of state medicine; member of the sanitary institute; public vaccinator to the whitechapel union; examiner in, and instructor of, vaccination, by order of the local government board. LONDON: PRINTED BY GEORGE STEVENS & CO., Ltd., 19 & 25a, Commercial Road, E. 1895. Offices of the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District. Public Health Department No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E. January 18th, 1895. Gentlemen, The District over which you preside is essentially a changing one, as regards the character of its houses, as well as the people who inhabit them. When I commenced practice there were many Courts and Alleys in the North and South portions of Whitechapel, which have now been replaced by large blocks of Artizans' dwellings—then Whitechapel was as much Anglo-Saxon in its population as any other part of Loudon. We have seen all this become altered, at first slowly, now so rapidly, that at the present time a stranger coming into some of the streets in Spitalfields might be excused for doubting that he was in the Capital of England at all. These changes of Nationality in population carry with them certain difficulties in administration which must be apparent at the first thought; difficulties such as could not have arisen if the population had remained a more or less stationary one. Some of these difficulties I shall have to mention later on, but for the present I am concerned with the one as to the probable Census of the District, and the problem how best to arrive at it. From experience we are inclined to doubt the accuracy of the Government Census Returns, because we know how difficult it is for Inspectors to obtain the correct particulars, even by carefully visiting each tenement. I can, however, only base my conclusion upon the estimated population in the middle of the year 1894, supplemented by other facts which I will now explain. During the year 1893, as I showed in my report for that year, 1,926 Foreign Aliens came into and remained in Whitechapel, and in the last year 1,046 Foreigners were added to our population, or an average of 1,500 each year. Further, it is to be noticed that the Whitechapel Board of Guardians' returns indicate the fact that at the close of the year there were 1,926 in-door paupers chargeable to Whitechapel who were resident in various Institutions and Schools, mostly outside the Whitechapel District; only 628 being resident in the Union Infirmary. Now, as all the deaths which take place in these Outlying Institutions are included in the Mortality Statistics for the District, I have added their populations also, and thus at the lowest computation, without accounting for the year's excess of births over deaths, the population for the Whitechapel District during the year 1894 can be stated at 78,300. 4 Mr. Cook's returns show absolute figures as follows:— Foreign Aliens in Whitechapel, 1894. Notified by the Secretary to the Jewish Shelter 1658 „ Other Authorities 358 2011 The results upon investigation were as follows :— Verified as remaining in the District 906 Unable to verify, addresses incorrectly given 140 Removed to other Districts, or gone abroad 925 Returned to their Native Towns 40 2011 The marriages within the District during the year amounted to 373. The previous year they numbered 550. The total number of births which were registered in the four Subregistration Districts during the 52 weeks amounted to 3,178. Of such number 129 occurred in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, which is in the Mile End New Town Sub-registration District. In 16 of these cases the children were born of women not previously resident in the District. The remaining 113 I have distributed among those Sub-Districts which had formed the homes of the mothers previously to their admission into the Infirmary. In this way 54 were referred to the Spitalfields Sub-District; 21 to Mile End New Town; 21 to Whitechapel Church Sub-District; and 17 to Goodman's Fields. Correctly disposed according to this plan, the births may be set out as under:— Mile End New Whitechapel Goodman's Total Spitalfields. Town Church Fields. 893 992 844 433 3162 The District birth rate therefore equalled 40.3 per 1,000. The Metropolitan birth rate was 30 per 1,000. The total deaths registered during the year amounted to 2,313. Table B* indicates the deaths which were registered in each Subregistration District. A deduction has now to be made of those deaths to the number of 891 which occurred among Non-Residents, nearly all of whom died in the London Hospital; and then to the remaining sum must be added the deaths of those Residents who died in Outlying Public Institutions, and elsewhere than in the District. These deaths, numbering 172, and the places where the deaths occurred, are tabulated in the Appendix as usual. Thus, the corrected number of District deaths for the year was 1,694. A death-rate for the year is recorded of 20 3 per 1,000, as compared with a Metropolitan death-rate of 17.7 per 1,000. * Page 26 of the Appendix. 5 CORRECT DISTRICT MORTALITY TABLE FOR TEN YEARS ENDING 1894.

The ages at death of the Residents who died during the year are to be seen in Table F* of the Appendix. The percentage of Deaths for each Age period was as follows:— 30.8% of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 19.3 „ „ „ between the ages of 1 and 5. 3.6 „ ,, ,, „ 5 and 20. 12.3 „ „ ,, „ 20 and 40. 17.0 „ „ „ „ 40 and 60. 14.0 ,, „ „ ,, 60 and 80. 2.1 „ „ „ over the age of 80. Compared with the Metropolitan deaths, including Whitechapel, the infant deaths were as follows:— The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 24.3 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.3 per cent. of the registered births; whilst in the Whitechapel District those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 30.8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 15.4 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 25.5 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 50.1 per cent. of the total deaths, and 25.1 per per cent. of the registered births. Table It has been constructed to enable one readily to contrast the mortality per cent. from each class of disease to total deaths, as regards the Whitechapel District, and the Metropolis as a whole. What do we find? Evidence, as usual, that diseases of the Zymotic class are more fatal elsewhere than in our district; because, whereas the percentage of deaths to total deaths from Zymotic diseases in London equalled 17.45, in the Whitechapel District the percentage was only 15.62. * Page 27. † Page 29. 6 Diseases of the Chest, and also Constitutional diseases, were somewhat higher in the Whitechapel District—because, perhaps, occupations liable to predispose to such diseases are more common in this district than in the Metropolitan area as a whole; but, on the other hand, we are not so liable to die from diseases of the nervous system. It is curious that, although the deaths from accidents have an almost identical percentage to total deaths in each list, yet where homicide and suicide are concerned our district can show the better record. This result is also to be mentioned in deaths from Privation and Alcoholism, although, on the other hand, fewer of our people die from that much envied cause of death—"Old Age." In passing, I must call attention to Table K*, which I have produced, to indicate the improvement apparent in our mortality returns since I first reported to your Board. It is clear that the improvement is in the direction of what may be termed "ordinary" diseases rather than in any of the diseases of the Zymotic type. Although Small-pox is again absent from the death-roll, owing to the excellent work of the Vaccination Officer, I regret to record that Measles, Scarlet Fever, Whooping Cough, and Diphtheria maintain a position equal to the previous decennial average. I have heard it adduced as an argument against the claims of vaccination that improved hygiene has determined the comparative disappearance of Small-pox rather than any prophylactic power said to exist in the vaccine lymph, If this be so, may I ask why the diseases I have named (which are still present with their old power of causing death) have not been edged out by the same sanitary improvements? Isolation can do much to prevent the spread of epidemic disease; but until some antidote has been introduced for each Zymotic disease, comparable with the Jennerian specific, we must be content to retain that disease, and to know that it will be ready at any time to increase its activity when favourable circumstances exist. It is almost unnecessary to allude to Antitoxin as a cure for Diphtheria, because during the past mouths the public journals have given much information upon the subject. That the new lymph has great properties in the reduction of temperature is certain, and probably it possesses other properties of great value. It is upon its trial. I am glad to see that the Metropolitan Asylums' Board have arranged with the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, at a cost not exceeding £375 during six months, for the colleges to undertake all the bacteriological work connected with hospital cases. The colleges will also report on a daily average number of at least twenty cases. The Sub-Committee of the Managers' Report continues— " and they think it the duty of the Managers (on the evidence adduced " from Germany, Paris, &c.) to take immediate steps for giving a fair " trial to the antitoxin treatment of Diphtheria, a form of treatment * Page 30. 7 "which is claimed to be successful in proportion to the early recogni"tion of the disease." The Managers have agreed to the above suggestions. Possibly these arrangements resulted from the munificent gift of £1,000 by the Goldsmith's Company to the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons. Now, although the number of deaths from the chief Zymotic diseases during 1894 were not materially fewer than during the preceding year, there was a remarkable diminution in the number of cases of Scarlet Fever in the District during the latter year. Only 11 cases of Small-pox were dealt with.* The grand total of 646 cases of Zymotic disease were investigated by Mr. Cook, and 588 of the cases were certified in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Over 60 per cent. of the cases notified were removed to Asylums' Board Hospitals; 37 per cent. were treated at their own homes; and the remaining cases either in the London Hospital or in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. The Medical Officer to the London County Council has produced some important evidence to show how highly probable it is that school influence bears strongly upon the spread of some of the infectious diseases, and in this connection it will be well to remember that Article 88 of the 1894 Code of the Educational Department provides valuable aid in cases of emergency, so far as regards Elementary Day Schools. It runs as follows:—" The Managers must at once comply "with any notice of the Sanitary Authority of the district in which "the school is situated, or any two members thereof acting on the "advice of the Medical Officer of Health, requiring them for a specfied "time, with a view to preventing the spread of disease, or any danger "to health likely to arise from the condition of the School, either to "close the School or to exclude any scholars from attendance, but, "after complying, they may appeal to the Department if they consider "the notice to be unreasonable." At present the arrangements are continued whereby the Authorities of the Elementary Schools in our District are kept accurately informed of all cases of infectious disease occurring among their scholars, or in houses where their scholars live. I hope that it will never be necessary to take advantage of the power which is given by the Article from which I have quoted. The Disinfecting Apparatus has performed good service during the year, and I have every reason to be satisfied with the general arrangements. Although sulphurous acid gas is still used as the routine disinfectant for rooms, it is supplemented in special cases by perchloride of mercury in solution. In the summer of 1894, the former provisions as to Cholera precautions were revived, and during the autumn months your Board added "Diarrhœa " to the list of notifiable diseases. * Six only were District Residents 8 I am informed by your Surveyor that the results in connection with the cremation of refuse have been highly satisfactory during the year, and I can bear testimony to the advantages which are derived from the daily collection of house refuse, which now is extended to nearly the whole District. It may interest you to know that at present only four Sanitary Districts out of 42 have Dust destructors, the remaining Authorities continue to dispose of the refuse in the manner which formerly you were obliged to adopt.

I have classified the Cause of the Deaths as follows:— Accidents—Run over, Fractures, &c.19 Burns and Scalds 10 Accidental suffocation in bed 8 ,, ,, by food, drowning, &c. 9 Suicide 5 Other Causes—Poison, Peritonitis, &c. 7 392 Inquests were held in the District during the year, of which 158 referred to Non-Residents, and 234 to District Residents. Nearly all the former took place at the London Hospital. Through the death of Dr. Macdonald, the London County Council were enabled to place the entire District of Whitechapel under the jurisdiction of one Coroner, so that during the year no difficulty has been reported in the working of the Mortuary arrangements. The Mortuary has received 182 bodies during the twelve months: Inquests were held upon all but 8. The Fees received by arrangement with the Coroner, for the use of the Coroner's Court amounted to £31 17s. Od. During the two years and nine months the Mortuary has been open, a total of 434 bodies were received into its chambers, and a total of £78 4s. Od. has been paid bv the Coroner in Fees. Water Supply in the Whitechapel District. In my last Report, I alluded to the action of the East London Water Company in limiting its supply of water, and I mentioned that a prosecution which was instituted against the Company for a breach of covenants, resulted in a verdict for the Water Company. Curiously enough the result of the drought of 1893 was to permit the Company to give constant supply to its customers during nearly all the summer of 1894, and then in the Autumn to compel it to resort to the intermittent system of supply. When it is understood that cisterns are not generally to be found in houses in the District, it will be apparent that great inconvenience frequently resulted from this arrangement. That some better and more certain system of water supply is necessary cannot be doubted. That one of the necessities of life should be in the hands of a trading company, who may limit its supply in the manner I have discussed, possesses risks which at least demand considerable attention. Registered Common Lodging-Houses are now under the control of the London County Council, instead of as formerly being under Police Supervision. These houses are fewer in number, being 86 now, as compared with 98 in the last year. I append a list as usual, showing the number of deaths among the inhabitants of these houses where 10 such deaths took place in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary or other Public Institution.

The influence of this class of institution upon the Metropolis has been discussed very fully of late. That some efficient legislation should take place to protect those who resort to them is apparent to all who have considered the subject. So far as those shelters within our District are concerned, the list which I append is very suggestive, the more so when it is remembered that few of the 830 persons really were belonging to the District.

It was generally admitted that some radical reform was demanded, and a number of resolutions was the outcome of a keen and prolonged debate. I cannot, however, think that any Government will bring in a Bill on the lines suggested by those resolutions, but I sincerely hope that we shall not wait long before all such institutions have to be registered in the same manner as Common Lodging-Houses. The various shelters enumerated above added 44 deaths to the District mortality—all but 3 of these deaths took place in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary. Of the remainder, 2 were registered in the London Hospital, and 1 in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. These were referred to the District Shelters as follows :— Salvation Army Shelter, 194, Hanbury Street 28 ,, „ „ Quaker Street 2 ,, ,, ,, 272, Whitechapel Road 7 ,, ,, ,, 51, Royal Mint Street 2 Dr. Barnado's Shelter, 12, Dock Street 5 44 Model Dwellings are still being erected within the District. Large Blocks are in course of erection in Goulston Street and also in Flower and Dean Street. Some of the tenements were already occupied before the close of the year, but I have not included them in this year's statistics. The death-rate for the year among the dwellers in Block dwellings was 18.3 per 1000, and the Zymotic deaths equalled 3.8 per 1000. For comparison purposes, I have classified the cause of death in the case of each resident in any Artizans' Building. 13 MODEL DWELLINGS. Number of Apartments, and Particulars of Population, 1894.

This important Act became Law on January 1st, 1895. I will not attempt to deal with its provisions in this Report, but one or two features in it may be interesting to you. It is forbidden to erect a building nearer than 20 ft. from the centre of the street, unless it be upon the site of an old building, "provided "always that no dwelling-house to be inhabited or adapted to be 15 "inhabited by persons of the working class, shall, without the "consent of the Council, be erected or re-erected within the prescribed "distance to a height exceeding the distance of the front or nearest "external wall of such building from the opposite side of the street." As regards buildings in the future upon new streets, the Act granted a space of 10 ft. down to the level of the ground; then they had given an angle of about sixty-three and a half degrees, an angle which was such that the distance from the wall was equal to twice the height of the building. Dr. Longstaff, Chairman of the Building Act Committee of the London County Council, who was active in the promotion of the Bill, was recently discussing its merits at the Parkes Museum. The Doctor stated "that Parliament threw upon the County Council "the imperative duty, under certain circumstances, of (at practically "whatever cost) buying out unhealthy buildings of persons of the "working-class, and seeing that more suitable dwellings were placed "thereon." Perfectly true! may I commend this opinion to the consideration of the Council when they next consider the question of " The Bell Lane and Great Pearl Street areas?" Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. I have been very unsuccessful in the application of this Act to worn out property. To begin with, I do not think Magistrates like it; and although very strong evidence has been produced in support of some prosecutions which I have been interested in, more difficulties have occurred with it than I have experienced with any other Sanitary Act. As an illustration, I will mention the houses in Hanbury Street and Samuel Court. These were represented through the activity of a Committee of your Board. Proceedings were instituted at Worship Street Police Court. Counsel appeared on both sides. The owner contended that, as he could and would do everything the District Board required, no Closing Order ought to be made. The houses were worn out and thoroughly dilapidated. No damp course was present, and the walls were wet in many places. The plaster was rotten and filthy. The front and back walls were in some cases dangerous. The magistrate granted an adjournment from time to time, and finally, after some six months had elapsed, the summonses were withdrawn upon the owner contributing Ten guineas towards the expenses of the prosecution. As evidence that the prosecution was justified, I may cite the fact that the front and back walls were renewed down to the ground floors; a damp-proof course was inserted into all outside and party walls; the floors were excavated and ventilated; new; woodwork was generally introduced, and new sashes and window frames were supplied. New plaster was added to both walls and ceilings. Fresh drainage was pro- 16 vided, and new water-closets were erected in the yards. The roofs received considerable attention. In fact, a very little larger outlay would have rebuilt the houses altogether; whereas now it can only be claimed that old houses still exist. I can never hope to have a case more in accord with what I conceive was the intention of the framers of the 1890 Act than the one I have thus briefly described. Recently, the result of the visits of Dr. Hamer to the Whitechapel District was communicated to and considered by your Board. I will not enter into detail concerning the Report and the reply thereto, because the reply which I append notices the points of importance in the Report. Board of Works —Whitechapel District. Reply to the Report by Dr. Hamer upon the Sanitary Condition of the Whitechapel District. December, 1894. The preface to Dr. Hamer's Report, which bears date 15th October, 1894, is written by Mr. Shirley Murphy, the Medical Officer to the London County Council. It recites the information that a complaint which was introduced into the Annual Report for 1893, and published by the Sanitary Committee of the Jewish Board of Guardians, was the origin of the instructions by the London County Council to its Medical Staff to prepare Reports concerning the Sanitary Condition of both Mile End Old Town Hamlet, and of the Whitechapel District. So far as regards the share which is allotted to Whitechapel in the Jewish Board of Guardians' Sanitary Report, it may at once be stated that the chief charge against the Whitechapel District has reference to blocks of buildings known as Booth Street Buildings, situated in Booth Street, Spitalfields. Upon page 75 of the Report it is stated that the difficulty of securing the remedy of insanitary conditions "was in some cases so great, that our "Inspector found it necessary in the course of 1893 to pay as many as 10 "separate visits to each of 19 houses, and to visit 40 different abodes on no "less than 20 distinct occasions." In this way 800 visits are accounted for because " each separate floor visited is counted as one house." Now it is only necessary to remember the fact that these Dwellings are inhabited almost entirely by Polish Jews, to be sure that the Inspector to the Jewish Board of Guardians is in error if he supposes that the defects to which he called attention from time to time remained unremedied so long as the Report of his Committee would lead a reader to believe, Such defects as choked drains are the outcome of foreign bodies being cast into the closets, and are of a description which Inspectors, however numerous, are powerless to prevent. The Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel has paid very special attention to Booth Street Buildings, and he reported to Her Majesty's Government upon their condition about two years since. He has further pointed out that the influential members of the Jewish Community can to a 17 great extent remedy the evils of which their Sanitary Committee complain, by using such personal influence in aiding their education, that these people may use, instead of abuse, the Sanitary Conveniences provided for them, and to which they have not hitherto been accustomed. The second paragraph of Mr. Murphy's preface to Dr. Hamer's Report has reference to the fact that Whitechapel still has an exceptional number of ill-arranged courts and alleys. If this be so, it is also a fact that they are chiefly contained within the areas well known as "The Bell Lane Area," and "Great Pearl Street." It cannot be necessary to recall the fact that these areas, so far back as 1871, were reprsented to the late Metropolitan Board of Works, and that progress had been made by that Authority in the direction of giving effect to those representations, when it was succeeded by the London County Council. The New Body, by its Committees and Officers, are thoroughly acquainted with the conditions of the areas, and during the present year, the Chairman of the Housing of tho Working Classes Committee admitted to a Deputation of the Whitechapel Board the necessities of the Case, but pleaded " Want of Funds " as a reason for the Council's inactivity in promoting a Bill for acquiring the areas under Part 1 of the " Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890." Dr. Hamer commences his Report with certain statistical information with which the Members of the Whitechapel District Board are familiar, as they entered into their Medical Officer's Report which was issued in the early part of the present year. The Committee do not proposo to discuss the interesting figures which have been extracted from Mr. Booth's excellent book upon "Poverty and Associated Conditions," because in such connection it has been shewn that theory and experience do not always agree with the results which may be deduced from such observations. It is an admitted fact that the Polish Jew, like the Native of the South of Ireland, has a strong affection for his home, be it only a single room: he will use his greatest efforts against being dislodged, even though one can prove to him that two better rooms may be provided for him elsewhere for the same rental. With regard to the other factors, such as excess of young married females, and surplus married males, mentioned by Mr. Booth, and quoted by Dr. Hamer, although interesting, they can only indicate the nature of the employments which attract the latter, and the large number of New Model Dwellings which attract the former. Dr. Hamer makes a point of the density of population being high in the Whitechapel District—240 persons per acre for the whole District, and 313 for the Sub-District of Spitalfields. He might have added 600 persons to an acre in the Bell Lane Area. A very little explanation will suffice to discount somewhat the apparent evil connected with such a high density of population. It must be so where cottages and small houses give place to huge piles of barracks called Model Dwellings. It must not be forgotten, in considering the effect of such buildings upon the future health and Sanitary Condition of a District, that when such structures are well built, and are inhabited by a selected class of tenants, comparatively little over-looking by the Sanitary Staff is called for, and the Sickness Rate, as well as the Death Rate, become much reduced. All Block Dwellings are not of course equally well built or well occupied, but nearly an 18 eighth part of the Whitechapel District population occupies dwellings of a class termed "good." Among these persons the Death Rate during 1898 was only 18.4 per 1,000, and the Zymotic Death Rate only equalled 3 per 1,000. Very many of the so-called Residents in the Whitechapel District have their Homes in Registered Common Lodging-Houses, and in Salvation Army and other Shelters, which are not yet Registered. These places being under special supervision, they do not call for a large amount of attention from the Sanitary Inspectors. Yet it is to these Institutions that Whitechapel is indebted for the difference in Death Rate between the Metropolis, and itself. The state of domestic overcrowding is alluded to in Dr. Hamer's Report, and here again Mr. Booth is quoted in respect to this question. Dr. Hamer, however, during his visits of Inspection, found very few real cases of domestic overcrowding, and that has been the experience of the Sanitary Officers. No comment is needed on the figures from the Board of Trade Returns as to the Immigration of Foreigners into the District. The matter has been fully dealt with in the Reports of the Medical Officer of Health for the Whitechapel District. Dr. Hamer's Report proceeds to deal with a recital of the general nuisances which he discovered in the course of his inspections. Little comment is needed concerning them, they are more or less of a class common to all Sanitary Districts in the Metropolis and which are readily remedied. Bakehouses, Slaughter-houses Milk Shops, &c., are briefly discussed more as a part of the Report by Dr. Hamer that in adverse criticism. It is worthy of comment that credit is given to the staff for the manner in which the work is performed, and for the many excellent improvements which are manifest in the District. Especial comment is made concerning the House Drainage improvements which are in evidence. Reviewing the facts included in Dr. Hamer's Report, and the preface by the Chief Medical Officer to the London County Council, your Committee is at once confronted with the fact that when your Medical Officer was appointed, two Sanitary Inspectors made up the Inspectorial Staff. At the present time there are 4 Inspectors and an Office Clerk in the permanent employ of the Board, and other assistance has been obtained when necessary. At the present time an Assistant Inspector is employed. Aid is also rendered for special work by the men who are ostensibly engaged for disinfection work. There is every reason to be satisfied with the improvements which have taken place in the Sanitary state of the District. At the present time so excellent a system of work is in practice that an enormous amount of work is carried out day by day, and it is to be noticed that some other large improvements have been projected, and will shortly be carried out within the District. Attention is directed in this Report to the great density of population in the Residential portion of the District. Recently, in perhaps 19 the most crowded streets, an owner of a small piece of land, offered it to the London County Council at a price not in excess of its building value. It would have sufficed for a playground for the children, and have added a few cells to the lungs which constitute our breathing spaces. Your board offered to contribute £1000 towards the acquisition of the land. The London County Council did not purchase it. Whilst I am writing, Model Dwellings are being reared on it. Should not Dr. Hamer's Report have been submitted to his Council for its comments when it was forwarded to your Board for your observations? Those who understand the District and its conditions can only appreciate the requirements which are demanded for its effective improvement—and I am happy to report that your Board have resolved to add two Inspectors to your staff. Looking back, I am reminded with gratitude of the liberality with which you have acquiesced in my suggestions from time to time for more help. Twelve years ago your staff consisted of Two Inspectors: well was their work carried out. Now we shall have for the year 1895, 6 Inspectors, 1 Clerk, and 3 men employed in disinfection. May I invite would-be critics to peruse the sheets in the Appendix to this Report? If the immense results are considered, and if it were understood how earnestly and well each of your Officers performed his particular section of duty, I am sure that outsiders as well as yourselves would be as satisfied with them as I am. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. APPENDIX. AREA AND POPULATION OF THE DISTRICT TO WHICH THIS RETURNS RELATES:— Area in Acres, 406 (Including 23 Acres of Water).

Sanitary Department. To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, According to the usual custom we have prepared a Tabulated Statement of the year's work, and which we hand you herewith. It will be at once seen that a large amount of work has been carried out. In many instances very large sums of money have been spent on structural alterations to property. In one instance the cost for 10 houses was £1,700, in another the cost for 17 houses was £1,250, in another the cost for 7 houses was £800, and in another the cost for 9 houses was £600 and so on in proportion in many other instances which space will not allow us to give details of. It will be also seen from the said Statement that a large amount of Reconstruction of House Drainage has been carried out under our supervision during the year. Very great care and attention was paid during the year to the question of unwholesome food. Particulars of the articles seized and destroyed will be found at the foot of the Statement above referred to. A large number of summonses were issued under the Public Health (London) Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act during the year. The fines and costs recovered amounted in all to £56. Is. A detailed statement of these summonses we also hand you herewith. It is gratifying to notice that there has been a very considerable decrease in the number of cases of Infectious Disease during the past year. The cases numbered in all 646, as against 1,383 in 1893, thus . showing a decrease of 737. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. We have been enabled this year to have removed to Hospitals such patients as required removal without any of the difficulty experienced last year. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, THOS. P. WRACK, GEORGE HARVEY, ALFRED COOK Sanitary Inspectors. 31st December, 1894. 38 THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.
