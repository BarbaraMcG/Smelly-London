LIbrary wan 89 Metropolitan Borough of Mandsworth ANNUAL REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1952 by J. TUDOR LEWIS, M.D., D.P.H. together with the Report of the Public Analyst REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1952 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg herewith to present to you the Annual Report on the health and sanitary conditions of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth for the year 1952. The Report, which in form follows closely that adopted by my predecessor, deals with many matters touching the health of the people of Wandsworth, and here all I need do is to indicate generally some of the more interesting and important details. Before doing this, however, I should like to refer to the long and distinguished service to the Borough Council of my predecessor, Dr. F. G. Caley. Dr. Caley retired from the service of the Council on the 6th of January, 1952, when I had the privilege of taking over responsibility for the Public Health Department. His retirement terminated an active career in the public health service which had been spent almost entirely with the Wandsworth Metropolitan Borough Council. He was first appointed by the Council in 1913 as Tuberculosis Officer and Deputy Medical Officer of Health. On the outbreak of war in 1914 he joined the R.A.M.C. and served with that Corps until he returned to civilian duties in 1919. In 1923, when the late Dr. Caldwell Smith died suddenly, Dr. Caley was appointed in his place and held the position of Medical Officer of Health with marked distinction until his retirement in 1952. Dr. Caley, therefore, had upwards of 40 years' service in the Public Health Department of Wandsworth, and during this period was intimately associated with the great expansion of the health and social services of the borough. In the earlier years of his service his interest was particularly in the field of tuberculosis, its prevention and cure, and later on he extended his interests very greatly, giving attention particularly to the development of the maternity and child welfare services, and playing an active part in connection with slum clearance. In 1938, through his appointment as Training Officer, he became responsible for the training of civil defence personnel in first aid and anti-gas precautions, and when in 1939 war was again declared, Dr. Caley was made responsible for the first aid posts and the light rescue parties, which in a borough of the size of Wandsworth, forming part of the vulnerable metropolitan area, involved a heavy weight of responsibility. I should like to say how easy it was for me to take over from Dr. Caley, and this can be attributed in no small measure to the 2 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 high state of efficiency in which he left the Department. I am sure it is the wish of everyone that Dr. Caley will enjoy many years of happy and fruitful retirement. The year under consideration was not one of any particular note from the health point of view. The population of the borough fell slightly as compared with the previous year. There was a slight reduction in the death rate and also in the birth rate as compared with 1951, while the infant mortality rate, that is to say, the number of deaths of infants of under one year of age per 1,000 live births, remained at 23, the figure for 1951. The number of deaths from causes associated with childbirth was three, and the still-birth rate was 16.6. There was a decrease in the number of infectious disease notifications, due mainly to a large reduction in the incidence of measles and whooping cough compared with the previous year. The number of cases of scarlet fever showed a slight increase, while there were 39 cases of infantile paralysis. Of these, 16 fortunately were of the non-paralytic type. Two hundred and thirty cases of dysentery were notified as compared with 117 in the previous year, a high proportion of these being in various mental hospitals situated within the borough. Special attention was paid by the Department to the investigation and control of cases of dysentery occurring at home. The number of deaths from tuberculosis dropped from 107 to 95. Of the many duties with which the Department has been concerned, either directly or indirectly, perhaps I should make special mention of one of the most important problems in public health and sociology of to-day, namely, the welfare of old people. We have tried to give particular attention to this very important subject, over and above our statutory obligations, by assisting and co-ordinating the many voluntary associations in the borough, which are doing such excellent work themselves in this sphere. We hope thus to weld together both voluntary and official bodies into one cohesive service whose one aim is the welfare of old people. A good deal of attention has been paid to the supervision of catering establishments, which involves a considerable amount of work in a borough of the size of Wandsworth. Towards the end of the year the new By-Laws for the Protection of Food made by the London County Council came into force, and the opportunity was taken by the Food Inspectors of visiting the traders concerned to give them every help and guidance in complying with the by-laws. 1952 was the first complete year in which the new and somewhat unusual system of public health administration in Wandsworth was in operation. I refer, of course, to the arrangement by which the Medical Officer of Health of Wandsworth is also Medical Officer of Health of the adjoining Metropolitan Borough of Battersea and Divisional Medical Officer for the London County Council Health Division 9, while the Deputy Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth is also Assistant Divisional Medical Officer. I do not wish to make more than a brief reference to this important subject in this 3 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Report, since at the time of writing the system has been operating for barely 18 months. I think, however, that the members of the Council should have a short interim statement about a method of public health administration which has given rise to a good deal of interest and comment. In order that the new arrangements may be seen in their proper perspective, it is important that the principles on which they are based should be recognized. Everyone is agreed that one of the major problems in the administration of the health services is to effect the closest liaison between the various branches of the health and medical services, responsibility for which was divided amongst a number of statutory bodies by the National Health Service Act, 1946. The main branches resulting from that Act are the local health and preventive medical services, the responsibility of various types of local authorities; the hospital and specialist services, the responsibility of the Regional Hospital Boards, Boards of Governors and the Hospital Management Committees; and the general medical or general practitioner services, the responsibility of the Local Executive Councils. There is no difference of opinion on the need for the closest co-ordination of the work of these three statutory bodies and of the officers of all grades who serve under them. It is harder to achieve this object, however, where there is dual responsibility within the local authority health services, and the difficulty is probably most acute within the County of London. The reason for this is that many of the metropolitan boroughs (Wandsworth, of course, is an example), which are responsible only for the environmental health services, are larger in population and acreage than many important provincial cities and counties, some of which are all-purpose authorities, whereas the London County Council (the largest public health authority in the country), is responsible for the personal health services and also for other services closely linked with them, namely, the education and welfare services. It is, I think, a testimony to the efficiency of the officers engaged in the local public health service in London that the standard of public health practice and administration under these conditions is so high, both in the environmental and the personal health spheres. Nevertheless, it must be obvious that this dual responsibility is a serious weakness in the administration and that great advantage would result from effecting a blending of the two sections of the preventive health service. There are a number of ways, no doubt of varying degrees of practicability, by which this can be attempted, and one is the method which has been adopted in this area, where the Medical Officer of Health for two adjoining metropolitan boroughs and the Divisional Medical Officer is the one person ultimately responsible to the three committees concerned with the administration of the two sections of the public health services. It should be possible by this means for the two branches of the public health and preventive medical services to be very closely combined and co-ordinated. 4 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 I am happy to be able to state that up to the present time no difficulty whatsoever has been experienced and I am unaware that any commitment or responsibility has gone undischarged. Apart from the practicability of the arrangement as a purely administrative measure, there are many other advantages. For instance, the two boroughs comprising Health Division 9 are such that they form a convenient and economic unit for the purpose of planning the public health services, and this means that over a fairly large area unified methods of sanitary administration and of the practice of public health and preventive medicine can be applied. This, in itself, tends to eliminate problems which might arise if there were three separate departments with three separate heads, and local difficulties can be the more easily ironed out; and this in turn greatly helps all sections of the work. Perhaps the most obvious advantages, however, are those which involve branches of the work which are partly the responsibility of the Wandsworth Borough Council and partly of the London County Council. To take the control of infectious disease as an example, if an outbreak occurs in a school or day nursery, the Borough Council is certainly responsible, as the authority charged with the prevention of infectious disease, for dealing with the epidemic, but the London County Council is also intimately concerned in that the infectious disease occurs in one of their institutions. By having one person responsible for both sides of the work there is only one guiding hand and the officers of both authorities can be employed in conjunction or separately to the best effect. We have had instances during the year of the great benefit which is derived from this arrangement. Another example is the care of old people. Their needs come to light in a variety of ways, and the borough Sanitary Inspectors, whose duties afford them entry into the homes of the people, are frequently the first to uncover the special problems of an old man or an old lady. On the other hand many of the health and social services from which the aged derive special benefit are the responsibility of the London County Council, although, under certain conditions, the responsibility for removing an old person to hospital rests with the Borough Council. Here again, with one person in charge it has been possible to secure the close co-operation of both authorities' officers, and the deployment at the right time and in the right way of the service most suited to the individual. Yet again, both authorities have important responsibilities in the matter of housing, particularly where priority recommendations on medical or health grounds are made, and undoubtedly this work is much facilitated by the new procedure. These are but a few instances of how the two separate services can be closely brought together under the system. An efficient public health and preventive medical service is essentially a team service, and it is likely that the team spirit is more vital in the system operating in Wandsworth than in any other. There 5 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 is no doubt that the greatest single factor making for success in this form of administration is an abundance of good will and a determination by all persons, both at Committee and officer level, to make the system work through a community of effort. It is most gratifying to be able to report that everybody concerned has shown the greatest keenness to ensure the success of this venture. I should like to record the great help and encouragement I have personally received from the members of the Wandsworth Borough Council, especially the members of the Wandsworth Public Health Committee, and in particular from the two Health Committee chairmen under whom I have served, namely, Alderman Mrs. C. E. F. Callingham and Councillor T. V. Rowlands. I have greatly appreciated and valued the help, encouragement and kindly advice which has always been forthcoming at member level. In like measure the Chief Officers of Wandsworth have done everything in their power to make my first year in the borough a happy and successful one, and if I mention Major R. H. Jerman, O.B.E., M.C., M.A., the Town Clerk, separately, it is because inevitably I have been most closely in touch with him. All the staff of the Health Department in all sections and grades have rendered me yeoman service and every member has played his or her part in the work as a whole. I should like particularly to mention my deputy, Dr. W. G. Harding, who, like myself, was new to the borough. Dr. Harding has been untiring in giving me every support and I am most grateful to him for the loyal and efficient way in which he has done so, and for ensuring that our contacts with other Departments and outside bodies related to our work have been close and harmonious. The Chief Sanitary Inspector, Mr. A. E. Vickers, has been most assiduous in his efforts to make available to me his extensive experience of sanitary work in general and of problems connected with the borough in particular, and I am most appreciative of the great help he has given me. To everyone concerned, therefore, I would like to express my warmest thanks for making my first year's work in Wandsworth as much a pleasure as it has been a privilege. Eighteen months is not a very long time and I have been deliberately cautious in making this statement. My feeling at the moment, however, is that the foundations of a permanent success have certainly been laid, and if the very happy spirit which has so far permeated the whole of our efforts at all levels can be continued, I see no reason why this method of public health administration should not, in this area, prove to be highly successful. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. TUDOR LEWIS, Medical Officer of Health. 6 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 STAFF The following changes occurred during the year. Resignations, etc. Mr. C.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS Area 9,199 acres Resident population in 1952 331,700 Wandsworth is the largest of the Metropolitan Boroughs. It has an area of 9,199 acres which includes a number of open spaces, with an approximate combined area of 1,200 acres. The population is a varied one, as the Borough contains residential neighbourhoods in addition to several working-class districts. The chief industries carried on are the manufacture of gas, electricity and motor accessories, laundries and general engineering. There is no trade which has any particular effect on the health of the workers or residents. 7 8 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Extracts from Vital Statistics Number of Live Births:— Males Females Total Legitimate 2,176 1,961 4,137 Illegitimate 109 128 237 Total live births 2,285 2,089 4,374 Males Females Total Number of stillbirths 44 31 75 Number of deaths 2,036 2,129 4,165 Birth-rate 13.18 Death-rate 12.55 Rate per 1,000 (Live and Still) Births Deaths from puerperal and post-abortive sepsis – – Deaths from other puerperal causes 3 0.67 Total 3 0.67 Infantile mortality per 1,000 live births:— All infants 23 Legitimate infants 19 Illegitimate infants 38 Deaths from Cancer 805 Diphtheria 0 Scarlet Fever 1 Measles 2 Whooping Cough 1 Tuberculosis 95 Tuberculosis death-rate 0.28 There has been no unusual or excessive mortality during the year.

This compares with a rate of 23 for 1951 and 22 for 1950. For the ten years ending 1942 the average infantile mortality rate was 50 while for the ten years ending 1952 the average rate was 31. Maternal Mortality Three deaths occurred from accidents and diseases of pregnancy. This is equivalent to a rate of 0.67 for 1,000 live and still births, compared with 0.64 in 1951. INFECTIVE DISEASES The number of deaths from notifiable infectious diseases, including all forms of tuberculosis, was 171. From all notifiable infective diseases the death-rate was 0.52 per 1,000. Table IV shows the number of cases of the notifiable diseases reported, arranged in age groups, and Table V shows the same figures arranged in the sub-districts in which they occurred. Smallpox No case occurred in the Borough during the year. Notification is frequently received from Port and Local Authorities of persons coming into the Borough who may have been in contact with Smallpox. Observation for the necessary period is kept on these persons by members of the Public Health Department. Diphtheria There were no confirmed cases during the year. Twenty-two cases were reported, but after admission to hospital were found to be incorrectly diagnosed. Scarlet Fever Five hundred and sixty-three cases of Scarlet Fever were notified or reported compared with 414 in 1951, 584 in 1950, and 495 in 1949. The diagnosis was not confirmed in 28 cases. One death was attributed to Scarlet Fever during the year. Whooping Cough Four hundred cases were notified during the year. There was one death. 13 14 TABLE IV.

Puerperal Pyrexia During the year 156 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified. Acute Poliomyelitis Seventy-three cases of this disease were notified or reported during the year, of which 34 were subsequently not confirmed. Of the remaining 39 confirmed cases, 23 were of the paralytic type and 16 non-paralytic. Five of the paralytic cases died. In 1951, 11 cases were confirmed with no deaths. Acute Encephalitis Two deaths were attributed to Acute Encephalitis. Ten other cases investigated were subsequently not confirmed. Meningococcal Infection Seven confirmed cases were notified. There was one death. Twenty-one other cases were investigated, but were subsequently not confirmed. In the previous year there were two cases with no deaths. Dysentery Two hundred and forty-two cases were notified or reported during the year, 101 being from institutions. Twelve cases were subsequently held not to be dysentery. There was one death. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever Of four cases reported during the year, two were subsequently confirmed as typhoid and one as paratyphoid. Diagnosis was not confirmed in the remaining case. There were no deaths. 17 INFECTIVE DISEASES Influenza The number of deaths from Influenza was 26 compared with 122 in 1951, 35 in 1950, and 45 in 1949. Influenzal Pneumonia and Acute Primary Pneumonia These are the notifiable forms of pneumonia. Fifty-two cases of acute influenzal pneumonia and 184 cases of acute primary pneumonia were notified. Fourteen of the former, and 50 of the latter died. The total number of deaths credited to all forms of pneumonia during the year was 180, compared with 161 in 1951. Malaria One recurrent case was reported. Erysipelas Sixty-eight cases were notified. No deaths occurred. Other Infective Diseases Fifteen deaths occurred from syphilis. Scabies Thirty cases were notified. Eighty-eight cases of scabies were treated at the Council's Cleansing Station under the supervision of the two bathing attendants. The majority of the cases were treated by two applications of benzyl benzoate and received a course of two baths each. Sixty-three other persons received cleansing treatment for various conditions. Food Poisoning One hundred and twenty-three cases were notified during the year. Ninety-four were individual cases, and 10 were outbreaks involving two or more persons and comprising 29 cases in all. The majority of the cases were only slightly affected and by the time notification was received and investigation carried out it was impossible to confirm the notified diagnosis. In most cases, too, the suspected foods were not available for examination and in four cases only was it possible to submit any food remains for examination. In all of these cases the examination revealed no organisms likely to be responsible for food poisoning. 18 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Diseases Reported from Schools A total of 5,078 infective diseases was reported from schools in the Borough throughout the year. The numbers of each disease were:— Scarlet Fever 261 Diphtheria 1 Measles 941 German Measles 2,018 Poliomyelitis 6 Chicken Pox 1,383 Whooping Cough 155 Mumps 224 Ringworm 9 Scabies 2 Other Diseases 78 Disinfection During the year 1,463 rooms were disinfected after infectious disease and 517 rooms disinfested for vermin. Bacteriological Examinations All these examinations are carried out by the Camberwell Research Laboratory which, in October, 1948, became a Public Health Service Laboratory directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health. The following is a summary of examinations made during the year:— Nose and throat swabs 537 Faeces for the typhoid and dysentery groups 751 Miscellaneous specimens 11 Total 1,299 NON-INFECTIVE DISEASES The total number of deaths from cancer and malignant disease was 805 the number of males being 414 and females 391. The deathrate was 2.43 per 1,000. The number of deaths in 1952 was 91 more than in 1951. Deaths from disease of the heart and circulatory system were 1,504, compared with 1,564 in 1951. Of these deaths 1,235 were of persons of 65 years of age and above. There were 577 deaths from diseases of the respiratory system compared with 572 in 1951. The number from bronchitis was 365 compared with 375 in 1951, and from pneumonia (all forms), 180 compared with 161 in 1951. Further particulars relative to pneumonia are given on page 17. One hundred and fourteen deaths were due to violence, 16 of them being due to motor accidents, 34 to suicide and 64 to other forms of violence. INVESTIGATION INTO DEATHS DUE TO FOG One hundred and sixty-seven inhabitants of the Borough of Wandsworth died during the week ending 13th December, 1952. The figure for the corresponding week in the previous year was 39. Of the 167 deaths, 86 were attributed to lung disease and 52 to heart disease; bronchitis caused the largest number of deaths, that is 56, 17 more than the total number of deaths from all causes during the corresponding week in the preceding year. I arranged for a detailed investigation to be carried out into the causes of deaths, a home visit being paid by two Sanitary Inspectors in all cases in which a post-mortem had been ordered by the Coroner, and the findings being reviewed in detail by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. The results of this enquiry were referred to the medical officers of the Ministry of Health. This Council has been a member of the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Advisory Council since 1939, when the Chairman of the Public Health Committee was appointed to be its representative. The question of membership of this body and also of the National Smoke Abatement Society, of which the Council was a member between 1937 and 1950, is at present under consideration by the Public Health Committee, as are also other means of investigating and combating atmospheric pollution. CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION AND INOCULATION Three hundred and forty requests were received from residents in the Borough for a certificate of vaccination or inoculation to be authenticated for the purpose of travel abroad. The signature of the person issuing the certificate was verified in each case as that of a registered medical practitioner practising in Wandsworth and the certificate was endorsed accordingly. 19 20 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 STAFF MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS At the request of the Committees and Chief Officers concerned, arrangements were made during the year for 17 members of the Council's staff to undergo special medical examinations. In the majority of cases the purpose of the examination was to determine the employee's future fitness for his occupation, following serious illness, and in eight cases it was found necessary to recommend superannuation. Thirty-seven shorter reports on members of the staff who were sick were obtained from doctors and hospitals at the request of the departments concerned. TUBERCULOSIS Notifications The total number of new cases which came to the notice of the Department during 1952 was 666 compared with 716 in 1951. The sources of information regarding the 666 new cases were as follows:— Primary notifications on Form A 423 Notifications from H.M. Forces 6 Unnotified at death 22 Transfers from other sanitary authorities 215 Total 666 Deaths The number of deaths certified as due to diseases of a tuberculous nature was 95.

In 42 premises the water supply was cut off for non-payment of rates, and in 66 premises because of defects in the service. Dustbin Accommodation—Section 105, Public Health (London) Act, 1936 During the year action was taken under Section 105 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in respect of 236 premises, and 224 dustbins were provided. Dustbins were also provided at 26 premises without the necessity of action being taken under the Act. Rodent Control Energetic measures for rodent control continued throughout the year, the system followed being that of prebaiting laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Rat and mice complaints received during the year totalled 2,219. Following is a summary of the work of the rodent operatives. Number of operatives' visits to premises 14,906 „ „ premises prebaited and treated with poison 1,300 „ „ premises prebaited and found not troubled 319 „ „ premises investigated and found not troubled 3,341 „ „ prebaits laid 28,732 „ „ poison baits laid 7,220 „ „ drains tested by Sanitary Inspector 476 „ „ drains found defective 279 „ „ rats estimated killed 8,407 There were seven rodent operatives and one clerk engaged on rodent control duties during the year under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector. 24 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Swimming Baths and Bathing Pools There are four public swimming bath establishments and one open air swimming pool belonging to the Council, one open air swimming bath owned by the London County Council, one public swimming pool privately owned, and a number of private bathing pools in the Borough. The Queensmere pond on Wimbledon Common has also for many years past been a recognized bathing pond. In four of the Borough Council's swimming baths, the water is purified by a process of continuous circulation through a filtration plant whereby the whole of the water is dealt with every three to four hours and chlorinated automatically during its circulation from the filtration plant to the bath. In the other bath belonging to the Council, each bath is emptied of water as often as necessary and refilled with fresh water which is continuously circulated and chlorinated automatically the whole time the bath is in use. Disinfection and Fumigation of Clothing and Rags for Export Disinfection in bulk of clothing intended for export was carried out at the Disinfecting Station. A charge is made for this service and by the end of the year £26 had been received by the Council. Fumigation of clothing intended for export was also carried out by the Council at a warehouse in this Borough. The amount collected for this service during the year was £8. At one factory in the Borough rags are washed and disinfected prior to export under the supervision of the Council's Inspector, and certificates are issued for which a charge is made. During 1952, 154 certificates were issued and the amount collected was £46. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention— National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47 In dealing with the problems of the many aged and infirm persons in the Borough, much advantage has been derived from the close liaison maintained between the Public Health staff and those members of the London County Council divisional staff who are concerned with the care of the aged. This co-operation with the County Council has meant that in many cases of aged persons of chronic infirmity and incapacity to look after themselves adequately, it has been possible to make satisfactory arrangements for their care and attention without the necessity of having to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. 25 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE BOROUGH During the year under review it was not found necessary to take action except in one case only, which was that of an old lady, aged 74 years, who was living alone in a flat under insanitary conditions and was physically incapacitated and unable to devote to herself proper care and attention. Action had been initiated in December, 1951, by my predecessor, Dr. F. G. Caley, and at the court hearing of this case in the following January Dr. Caley himself attended. A court order was granted for a period of three months and the old lady was removed to a home under the control of the London County Council. Eradication of Bed Bugs The methods employed for freeing infested houses include the stripping of all paper from the walls, the removal of wooden mouldings and skirtings and application of a blow lamp to the room surfaces. Candles are often used by house owners and the spraying of rooms by the disinfecting staff of the Council is carried out, proprietory insecticides being used. Infested bedding is removed to the Disinfecting Station and treated by steam. During the year 322 houses were found to be infested with bed bugs and disinfestation was carried out in all cases. Special steps are taken to ensure that the furniture and clothing of families about to be accommodated in the Council's houses or flats are freed from vermin. Hydrogen cyanide gas is used for the disinfestation of the furniture, which is placed in special vans constructed for the purpose, the process being carried out by a contractor. Bedding is not subjected to hydrogen cyanide but is disinfested by steam at the Council's Disinfecting Station. Mortuary and Crematorium The Mortuary at Wandsworth was used throughout the year and 445 bodies were received there. Under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, 1,239 cremations were authorised during 1952 as compared with 1,243 in 1951. Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the responsibility of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of persons who die or are found dead in the Borough, and for whom no suitable burial arrangements are made or are being made. The number of persons buried or cremated under the provisions of the Act during 1952 was 26. 26 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 HOUSING Statistics Relating to Housing Public Health Act Number of houses inspected on account of complaints or illness 9,834 Re-inspections 33,924 Number of statutory notices served:— Intimation notices 3,438 Nuisance notices 1,041 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 3,875 The number of cases referred to the Solicitor for legal action during 1952 was 218 The following is a summary of Police Court proceedings:— Number of summonses served 57 „ „ „ withdrawn 15 „ „ „ adjourned 26 „ „ Orders made for abatement of nuisances 16 Costs awarded in respect of three cases .. £4 4s.

At its meeting of the 16th December, the Council gave instructions for the London County Council to be formally notified, in accordance with proviso (a) to Section 33 of the Act, that it was the Council's intention to take into consideration a proposal that the areas comprising these properties should be declared Clearance Areas. FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES There are four Inspectors engaged in the supervision of the food supply. One of them is the Food and Drugs Inspector of the Borough who is occupied in procuring samples of food and drugs for analysis by the Public Analyst and the Public Health Laboratory and the supervision of dairy premises. The other three Inspectors are designated Food Inspectors and supervise all other premises where food is sold, stored, manufactured, or prepared for sale. One-third of the Borough is allocated to each Inspector. The three Inspectors also carry out the duties required under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. With the object of ensuring that all food businesses are supervised systematically, a register of all premises where a food business is carried on has been compiled and is kept up-to-date. This Register includes not only those premises which are subject to some form of legal control, but also all other premises in which a food business of any description is carried on. The total number of food premises on the register in the Borough is 2,705 and during 1952 they were visited on 40,965 occasions. Table IX has been drawn up to show the number of visits to various food premises in different parts of the Borough. Milk Supply The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 These Regulations came into force on 1st October, 1949, and require local authorities to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of distributor in their district and of all premises within their district which are used as dairies, not being dairy farms. During the year 26 applications have been received from persons to be registered as distributors of milk. In each case the certificate of registration was granted. Twenty-two notices of cancellation of registration have been received. At the end of the year there were 198 persons on the register, including 17 persons with premises outside the Borough. There were 31 dairies on the register at the end of the year. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies and its quality is good. 29 30 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 TABLE IX.

There were 3,231 visits made to these shops during the year. Slaughter of Animals There are three private slaughter-houses in the Borough and they were visited on 47 occasions during the year. Six carcases of pigs were inspected after slaughter. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933-51 Section 3 of this Act provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted by a local authority and in force under this section.

There are 13 artesian wells in the Borough. The water from six of these wells is used for drinking and in the manufacture of food. Eleven samples of water were examined for contamination, and were found to be free from pollution. Three of these 13 wells were not in use pending repairs. The Food and Drugs Act, 1938 Registration of Premises Section 14(1) of this Act requires that any premises used or proposed to be used for:— (a) the sale, or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of icecream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale; or (b) the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food; shall be registered by the owner or the occupier thereof with the local authority. During the year 100 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14(l)(a) and 25 applications for registration under the provisions of Section 14(l)(b) were submitted to the Council. In all cases the premises were found to be satisfactory and the registration granted. 35 FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES Section 57(l)(a) of this Act requires that it shall not be lawful:— for the occupier of any premises to use them as a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard or permit them to be so used, unless he holds a licence granted under this section by the local authority authorizing him to keep those premises as a slaughter-house, or as the case may be, as a knacker's yard. During the year three applications for the renewal of licences to use premises as slaughter-houses were submitted to the Council and granted. Bacteriological Analysis of Ice-Cream During the year 80 samples of ice-cream were tested in accordance with the technique suggested by the Ministry of Health and Public Health Laboratory Service. These samples were examined at the Public Health Laboratory, Camberwell. The following table gives a summary of the results:— TABLE XI. Methylene Blue Test Coliform Test Provisional Grade Number of Samples Coliform in l/10th ml. (non-faecal) Number of Samples 1 27 Bacillus coli—absent 28 2 8 „ „ —present 12 3 4 4 1 Faecal coli—present — Total 40 Total 40 In addition, three samples of ice-lollies were submitted to the coliform test. Bacillus coli was not found in any of these samples. 36 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Analysis of Food and Drugs During the year 1,099 samples of foods and drugs were procured for analysis. Three hundred and eighty-three samples of milk, 626 other foodstuffs and 90 drugs. Of these 346 were submitted as formal samples while 753 were purchased informally. Three, or 0.9 per . of the formal samples, and 21, or 2.8 per cent. of the informal samples, were found to be adulterated or not up to standard. The total adulterations reported were 24, or 2.4 per cent., of the samples submitted. The 24 samples found to be adulterated were:— six samples of ice-cream, three each of pork sausages and sal volatile; two of milk; one each of anchovy paste, herring roes, meat extract, non-brewed condiment, peas, scone flour, senna pods, sherbet, soup and tincture of iodine. It was not necessary to take Police Court proceedings in any of the above cases of adulterated samples. 37 FOOD AND FOOD PREMISES SPECIAL ANALYSIS One sample of tinned crab paste was submitted for examination following a question as to its fitness for sale. All cultures remained sterile. The product was found to be fit for sale. Three tins of luncheon meat were submitted to a bacteriological examination following a question as to their fitness for sale. In each case the Analyst was of the opinion that the cooking process was not sufficient to kill organisms in the unprepared meat and other ingredients. The product was quite unsuitable for human consumption. A total of 1,592 tins of luncheon meat was surrendered by shopkeepers and destroyed. Two samples of synthetic cream and one sample of cream sandwich were taken from a bakery in this Borough. An organism was isolated in the sample of cream sandwich which did not conform to any known pathogen. Faecal bacillus coli was found in one of the samples of synthetic cream. The other sample was found to be free of pathogenic organisms. One sample of synthetic cream was obtained from a manufacturer of synthetic cream in this Borough. No pathogenic organisms were isolated from this sample. Fourteen samples of synthetic cream were obtained from a firm packing the cream for sale by retail. In one case the number of organisms found was less than ten. In all 14 cases bacillus coli was not found and no pathogenic organisms were isolated. Eighteen samples of synthetic cream were purchased from retail shops in this Borough. In seven cases the number of organisms were more than 100 and in another seven cases the number was 100 or less. But in all 18 cases bacillus coli was not found and no pathogenic organisms were isolated. One sample of synthetic cream powder was purchased from a retail shop in this Borough. A number of organisms were found but bacillus coli was not found and no pathogenic organisms were isolated. FACTORIES ACT, 1937 Prescribed particulars required by Section 128 PART I. (1) INSPECTIONS.

For informal samples 2.8 per cent. For all samples 2.4 per cent. 42 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1952 Complaint Samples Case No. 346. Milk. On examination the milk was found to be sour with an acid value of 2.4. The complaint was of an indefinite nature. Whether the complaint was justified or not depends on how long the complainant had had the bottle of milk. Case No. 347. Pork Sausages. The complainant alleged that the sausages were deficient in meat. The meat content was 57 per cent. and the sample was therefore 8 per cent. deficient in meat. The complaint was considered justified. Case No. 544. Canned Crab Paste. This sample was found to be quite satisfactory and was passed as genuine. The complaint that it was unfit for consumption was considered not justified. Case No. 799. Canned Meat Extract. This sample was found to be quite unfit for consumption. The complaint was considered justified. Case No. 924. "Pep" Sweets. The complainant alleged that the "sweets" caused sickness. They were intended as, and sold as, a practical joke. An analysis of the "sweets" was not carried out and the sample has not been included in the total number of samples examined. Case No. 940. Sherbet. "Kiddies' Fountain". This sample was submitted as a possible cause of food poisoning. Nothing of a deleterious nature could be found. The preparation gave an alkaline mixture with water, the taste being decidedly unpleasant. The amount of tartaric acid was less than that required to neutralize the bicarbonate of soda. Case No. 1035. Canned crab paste. The complaint that the sample was unfit for consumption was considered not justified. Cases Nos. 1072, 1073, and 1074. Christmas puddings. The puddings were examined for the presence of mites and other infestations. They were found to be free from any sign of infestation and were in excellent condition. The complaint was not justified. • 43 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST FOR 1952 Milk The average composition of the samples of milk submitted during each month of the year and returned as genuine was as under:— Month Number Total solids Milk fat Non.fatty solids January 37 % % % 12.50 3.73 8.77 February 18 12.31 3.57 8.74 March 44 12.11 3.46 8.65 April 14 1207 3.43 8.64 May 24 1204 3.32 8.72 June 36 12.20 3.42 8.78 July 29 12.19 3.51 8.68 August 22 12.09 3.48 8.61 September 36 12.51 3.65 8.86 October 12 12.69 3.74 8.95 November 33 12.73 3.82 8.91 December 64 12.74 3.85 8.89 The average composition of the 369 samples of milk received during the year and returned as genuine was as under:— Total milk solids 12.39 per cent.
