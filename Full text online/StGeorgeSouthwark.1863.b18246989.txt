SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY. PREFATORY NOTE. The Seventh Annual Report of the Vestry of this Parish, being that for the Year ending on the 25th of March, 1863, is prepared and published in pursuance of the Provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts. The particulars of the Sanitary condition of the Parish will be found in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health and the Tables connected therewith. The Vestry Accounts, duly vouched as the law requires, and the other Statements herein contained, shew the general Proceedings of the Vestry. Besides the Accounts of the Churchwardens, and those of the Overseers and the Guardians relating to the Poor Rates, which are given as usual, there are now subjoined (p.p. 36-38) the Accounts which, pursuant to the Act of last Session, the Overseers have rendered relating to the rates raised by them under the Orders of the Vestry. It is matter of congratulation to the Parishioners at large, that during the year has been effectively completed the arduous, difficult, and anxious process of revising the rating of that portion of the property in the Parish which was unduly rated below the general Assessment of the Parish. The result, as reported to the Vestry on behalf of the Assessing Committee, was, that, without the introduction of any new principle of valuation whatever, but merely by the fair and equitable application of those principles of Assessment which have been all along in operation in the Parish, the total of the Assessments of the Parish, which had been £125,724, became £139,179. The difference £13,455 is equivalent to a permanent reduction of the Poor Rate throughout the Parish equal to nearly sixpence in the Pound per annum, and a corresponding reduction of all the other Parochial Rates. The special thanks of the Vestry to the Assessing Committee and to the Vestry Clerk in relation to this business are recorded in the minutes of the Vestry under date April 7th, 1863. On application to the undersigned at the Vestry Hall, any Parishioner will be furnished with a Copy of this Report. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Borough Road, June lst, 1863.

ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1863. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, There were 2074 births registered during the 52 weeks ending 28th March, 40 more than during the previous year; of these births, 1055 were boys, and 1019 The births were most numerous in the first quarter, and least in the second quarter. must bear in mind, however, that our first quarter commences in March. 1470 persons died in the year; and the annual rate of mortality was 26.48 per 1000, or, one in 38. The deaths were 51 more than in the previous year. They were fewest in the second quarter, and highest in the fourth. I present you with a Table, in which are marked the numbers of deaths of males, and females, in each sub-district for every week in the year; and also with the mean. temperature for the week; you will thereby, be enabled to compare the rise and fall of the mortality, with the rise and fall of the Thermometer. 1863; girls, You TABLE No. 1.

We may place the death, rate at 17 per 1000, with the greatest certainty of not making it too low, for, in some localities it has sunk down to 15 per 1000. That of this district is, as I have said, 26.48; consequently there have died during the past year 526 persons, who had they lived in Glendale, Rothbury, or Eastbourne, would now have been in the possession of life, and fulfilling the duties, that life demanded from them. These persons have come to as an untimely an end, as if they had been swept from off the earth, by a platoon of musketry. If one situation is so genial, and healthy, that only 15 die in the 1000 annually; and in another situation 36 die in the same number, and time; it is very clear that there must be some destructive cause at work,—either arising from climate, occupation, or the social condition of the people,—in the one, which is absent from, the other. To keep down to the lowest point the death rate, is one of the most grave, and important duties of this Vestry. For the death rate will proclaim aloud, and truthfully to all who will listen, our sanitary condition. We cannot hide the fact if we would. Yearly must be recorded the number of deaths, and the causes which produced them. Many of these causes are removeable, many more are reducible; nevertheless to bring about any notable diminution will be a work, in which time must greatly help. Good comes slowly; it is like growth, silent, and gradually progressive; there is first the blade, then the ear, then the full corn in the ear. Destruction alone is in the sudden whirlwind; and in the throes of the rending earthquake. To carry out measures which have for their end, the general good, is by no means a plain and simple task. Many great and wise plans have been frustrated, or ruined, from the way in which it was sought to bring them into operation. All must pass through a period of opposition and ridicule; and the Public Health Movement has not escaped the trial: but it has passed through unscathed, and the better for the discipline One proclamation of our advance, and success, has been made; the Registrar General in his weekly returns of births, deaths, and causes of death in London during the year 1862, says, "The South districts have achieved for themselves a marked improvement."

Zymotic diseases fall with terrible severity upon the young. More than half of the number of those who have perished from these diseases, have not reached five years of age Under this heading there have been registered 408 deaths; giving an excess of 54 over the preceding year. This increase has been caused by the greater prevalence of Small pox, Measles, Scarlatina, and Typhus. In place of the small mortality of four deaths from Small Pox in 1861-2, there has been the excessive one, of 46; Scarlatina in excess by 18; and Measles is by 34. Over these two latter diseases, we do not possess that decided control, which we do over the former. Typhus has been fatal in 88 cases ; the majority of which happened during the first quarter. I shall speak more fully on this disease further on, in my Report. Diarrhoea, the prevalence of which is said to be the special mark of sanitary neglect in the localities where it is met with, has decreased from 62 to 32. This disease however is very much under the influence of the temperature, and that during last summer, was lower than the average for many years. For your further information upon this subject I refer you to Tables 3 and 4. TABLE 3.

I had to tell you last time of an increase of deaths under five years of age, and this tale I must again repeat; but the number is greatly lessened. In 1861-2 there was a rise of 104; in the year now ended of 22 only. The deaths of Infants add very largely to our mortality Tables. These deaths, so unnatural, and so numerous, have long drawn the especial attention and regard of those who take thought, for the well being, and future progress of our race. "They are amongst the most important studies of sanitary science." Two in Five die before the fifth year is reached. During the last year, 710 deaths have been registered. The causes of this vast destruction of children are apparent enough; for dangers lie thick around them, arising from locality, from ignorance, from neglect, and often from the utter carelessness, of those whose duty it is to nurse and tend them. However there are other, and more hidden influences at work in the production of these deaths. For instance, there is to be considered the moral and physical condition of the parents, and particularly that of the mother, whilst child-bearing. Impressions are then made upon it, which will tell powerfully upon its future existence; whether it shall be born "rightly formed, or painfully deformed"; whether it shall be impressed with healthy tendencies that shall make life happy, and long; or, with unhealthy tendencies, that shall make life a burthen, and a weariness, and death unseasonable. The place where a child is born, exerts also a vast power over its future viability: if in Town, then are the chances of death twice as great, as they would have been had it born in the Country. Dr Arnott states that an individual, the offspring of those who have lived continually in foul air, will have his constitution very different from that of a child who is born of parents who have lived a long time in the country. Accompanied with the want of pure air, and open spaces, there often is want of proper and sufficient food; also of that care and cleanliness so requisite to infant life : hence follows Scrofula in all its various and hideous aspects. Then we have commerce and domestic duties; in direct and irreconcilable opposition, the one to the other. Girls, as soon as they are old enough, are sent off to Factories, or other places, instead of staying at home under a mother's superintendence, and gaining that knowledge which should prepare them for the performance of those duties that must hereafter necessarily devolve upon them; hence of these duties they are profoundly ignorant. But then, the mothers are not at home; they also are engaged abroad, the consequence of which is, that the infants are neglected, left with careless nurses, and suckled only, when she rushes home for her own meals. How often do we see families of children left to the care of one another, in rags, and filth, whilst the parents are away in search of the bare means of subsistence; and left in rooms, or passages, so foul and sickening, that our senses are shocked, and our sorrow excited, at witnessing human beings doomed to spend their childhood, so. How can either health, or home affections be promoted, or exercised, under such untoward influences? Just when children are most susceptible, and most in need of a mother's love, and care, then are they left, or committed to the care of others, whose interest is merely a paid one. With reference to factory women, this subject has been strongly put by Simon, "Domestic obligation," he says, "is outbidden by the labour market; and the poor factory woman who meant only to sell that honest industry of hers, gradually finds that she has sold almost every thing which other women understand as happiness." In striking contrast with this, it has long been remarked, that when labor is short, or stopped, then the mortality of infants rapidly decreases. The explanation lies close at hand. The mother now that the factory doors are shut, has no call to leave her home; she Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1862. 15 remains there, and carries out the instincts of her nature; and the result is that which I have stated. Infant life will always be preserved in proportion to the care that is bestowed upon it: for the delicacy of its organisation, and the susceptibility of its nervous system renders it peculiarly obnoxious to external influences, and makes its hold on life very insecure. Indeed an infant death rate is the most delicate test of the sanitary condition of any place. "It cannot be too distinctly recognised that a high local mortality of children, must almost necessarily denote a high local prevalence of those causes which determine a degeneration of race." But there still remain other causes, which like lesser currents, add to the depth, and sweep of this great death stream. There is the baneful system of drugging so prevalent, and so unconsciously as it were, carried on. In Coventry, the quantity of Godfrey's Cordial consumed was found upon enquiry to amount to the enormous quantity of ten gallons per week, equal, Dr. Greenhow tells us, to 12,000 doses. A member of the Town Council of Nottingham has said, that in the shop where he served his apprenticeship, 13 cwt. of treacle was manufactured into Godfrey's Cordial; and another gentleman of the same Council, and in the drug trade, stated that he had sold about 400 gallons of Laudanum annually; one half at least of which, he believed, was given to infants. We may reasonably ask, What justification the mother has to give for the lavish use of this baneful drug ? She has an answer ready; and plausible enough, also. Her husband, with others of the family, are out at hard work all the day; and they must have their rest, which is impossible if disturbed all night by the cries of children. So their cries are stifled; smothered down into silence beneath the benumbing influence of opium: and thus perish thousands; indirectly doubtless, as they dwindle and pine gradually and slowly away*. Lastly, there is the most sad, and most dreadful cause of all yet enumerated, resulting in the deaths of Infants:—Murder. This is done for the purpose of hiding shame, or being freed from a burden, or to obtain burial money. "In the starved cities, in the uttermost doomed ruin of old Jerusalem, fallen under the wrath of God, it was prophesied and said, 'The hands of pitiful women have sodden their own children.' The stern Hebrew imagination could conceive no blacker gulf of wretchedness": yet now, in this neither starved nor doomed city, is infanticide increasing to a very serious extent, and by the "hands of pitiful women." For all these causes, which give rise to so large an Infant mortality, no one remedy exists. The evils have sent their roots far too deep down, and have so intertwined themselves with our social system, that all hope of their speedy and sure removal would be vain. Before any steps however can be usefully taken, it will be necessary that they be thoroughly examined and understood. Some little advance has certainly been made within the last few years, in the general rearing of Infants. There is abroad, a greater amount of knowledge concerning their wants and necessities. Social science has taught mothers, and nurses, the folly of rolling them up in mummy fashion; leaving no room for play of lung, and limb. The advantage of cleanliness is better appreciated; and a purer air is far more obtainable now in towns, than was formerly possible. But these advantages, when compared with the evils that still remain,—how small! * See the Fourth Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, pp 195, 1861. 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

There have been registered 43 deaths from violence and privation; three more than in 1861-2. As usual, I will notice the most particular of these Ten children have perished from accidental suffocation; their ages reaching from three days, to eight months. Two deaths happened from burns; a child aged two years from the clothes taking fire; and a woman from the same cause, and in the same manner. Three deaths from scalds have been registered; a child aged 1 year from having the chest scalded, and followed by gangrene; another aged 2 years from falling into a copper; and the third aged 1 year from overturning a plate of hot soup. Three boys died from being run over; one aged 9, and another 10, from carts passing over their bodies; the third from a van passing over his head. Injury to the brain has been fatal in 6 cases; a female aged 44 from apoplexy, caused by excessive drinking; a male aged 70 from laceration of the brain following a fall; a male aged 31 from compression produced by a similar accident; a child just born from a fracture of the scull; and a female from rupture of the blood vessels of the brain, from external violence. A male aged 71 was found dead in bed; a female aged 43 was found dead, from lying with her head downwards, whilst intoxicated. A male aged 35, died in 48 hours from erysipelas, produced by a poisoned wound. Two deaths are recorded from suicide; one a female aged 40 from taking oxalic acid; the other, a man who cut his throat and died instantly. There have been 2 deaths from wilful murder; a child newly born was found with its throat cut; and a woman aged 33 died from two stabs in the abdomen; made by a screw driver, and a chisel. The deaths from old age have been 34; 47 persons had got beyond four score years when they died. One was a widow aged 98, who had lived for more than 40 years in one of those old wooden houses lately pulled down in Falstaff's Yard. This bears out a fact long observed, that very old people are frequently met with in the most wretched parts of a parish, where there is present every thing unfavourable to health, and where the average duration of life is low.

It is not satisfactory to dwell upon the fact, that there are so many towns situated upon the banks of the Thames above Teddington Lock, which are daily pouring into the river all their sewage, and other refuse matter. It may be so far diluted as not to be injurious to any appreciable extent to the health; still the nnpleasant fact remains. The Regius Professor of Medicine in Oxford, Dr. Acland, sympathises with us concerning this subject, and is astonished at our forbearance. He says, "Why the Londoners do not rise up in arms against us provincials, for remorselessly pouring our sewage upon some of their water companies, is a standing marvel. We may now assume that the elements of disease are carried in water, though to what distance we do not know. Ordinary prudence should therefore keep the upper rivers above great towns as pure as is practically possible." The mean temperature of London for the year 1862 was 49.5°. The temperature of the air for the first quarter was characterised by its variability, cold and warm days alternating one with the other, the former however predominating in number and duration. Mr. Glaisher states, “I have no recollection of such a succession of hot and cold periods of nearly equal lengths." The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich for the period was 41.1°, giving an excess of 1.6° for 21 years. There was in each of these months an excess of temperature above the average. The fall of rain in January was 1.9 inch, in February 0.5 inch, and in March 3.7 inches. The temperature of the second quarter differed little from the average, being 53.3°. From the 1st of April to the 7th there was a mean daily excess of 5°. On the 8th a cold period set in, and continued until the 16th, with a mean daily deficit of 5°. This was followed by a period of warm weather, with few exceptions, until the 8th June. During 18 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. this period the temperature for several days was considerably above the average. On the 9th a cold period set in, which continued until the end of the month; the mean daily deficit being more than 4°. The mean temperature for April was higher than that of any April since 1854; and that of May since 1848. The total fall of rain was nearly 7½ inches, exceeding the average of the preceding 43 years by a little more than 1½ inch. The mean temperature for the third quarter ending September 30th, was 58-7°, being 1.3° less for the average during the same quarter for 21 years. That for the three months ending August constituting the summer months was 53.9°. There was less sunshine, and more cloud than had before been experienced. From the 9th of June, until the 12th of September, with few exceptions, the weather was cold. Within this long period there were twelve days only in which the temperature of the air reached or exceeded its average value, and the access above the average, on the very few days so distinguished, was generally less than 3°; and on one day only, viz, the 1th of September, it was as large as 5°" Rain fell on 40 days out of the 96 to the amount of 7 inches. "From the 13th of September the weather was warm, and for the 18 days ending the 30th of September, the average daily excess over their averages was 2¾. The total fall of rain was 6.3 inches. The degree of humidity was at all times above its average value. From the beginning of the last quarter of the year until the 17th, the weather was warm, the excess of temperature rising to 4½° daily. In the early part of October the weather was changeable, and continued so until its close, with an average deficiency of temperature of 1½° daily. The mean temperature of this month was 51.8°, being higher than any October since 1847, excepting 1857 and 1861. On the 16th of November a cold period set in, and continued to the commencement of December, with a deficiency of tenperature of 4½° daily. The mean temperature of November was 39'8°, being lower than any November since 1829, with the exception of 1851 and 1858. From the 3rd of December to the end of the year, there was an average excess of temperature of 4 daily, just the reverse of the preceding month. The mean temperature for the whole quarter was 45.0°, being above the average. The total fall of rain was 6.6 inches.* No events of importance have occurred during the past year claiming particular notice; except perhaps the licensing of cow-houses, which had become a necessity in the progress of sanitary measures; unless indeed they were to be left as landmarks, to signify how far these measures had advanced during the past few years. In the 93rd clause of the Act to amend the Metropolis Local Management Acts (25 and 26 Victoria, cap. 102,) it was required that a license should be obtained by cow-keepers from the Justices of the Peace. Every cow-house in the district was visited by the Sewers Committee and the Officers, previous to the applications being sent in. In spite of the pains taken by the Vestry Clerk, and the Inspector of Nuisances, to give all necessary information, as to the mode of proceeding, many failed to carry out the legal requirements; and many failed also to carry out the instructions of the Committee, as regards sanitary improvements. These did not obtain their licenses on their first application. Ultimately, however, all did receive them. Many of the cow-sheds are not now all that is desirable; but improvement will gradually go on, as has been the case with slaughter-houses. Many feel annoyed at such demands being made upon them; many are careless, and some thoroughly ignorant. By and by they * The above account of the weather, is compiled from the quarterly returns of the Registrar General. Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1862. 19 will find the comfort, and the benefit following such measures; so that what at first was unwillingly and grudgingly complied with, will in the end be done cheerfully and voluntarily. The consumers of milk will also come in for a share of the good; for it was in possible that the milk of cows kept as they formerly were, could possess those sweet and nutritive qualities essential to it. The sheds were most foul, and neglected, and the cows covered with their own droppings; this certainly must have affected their health, and if their health, then the milk which they produced. But towns are not fit places for the keeping of cows, as they are crowded too much together, besides being kept in their stalls from the time they enter, until they are taken out to be killed. Their food is not that which is most suitable for continued health, but that which will aid, by its stimulating qualities, to yield the most milk. There were at the time of our visit 215 cows, one bull, and one calf. TABLE No. 7.

Epidemic visitations are shrouded in mystery; we do not know, why at one time, they should be present; and at another time absent; nor why, one kind should be prevalent and another in abeyance. These visitations it may never be in our power to hinder; but the numbers now sacrificed, may be greatly decreased. This district, alike with other districts in London, has suffered greatly from Fever. In the first quarter 48 deaths were registered, precisely the same number that were registered in the year of 1861-2: and as many as 9 persons have died in the week. You may judge of its mortality by comparing the number of deaths that occurred in 1860, with that of 1862; in the former year 20 deaths were registered, and the latter 107: during the same period in London the numbers were 1392, and 3635. The mortality however in 1860 was Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1862. 21 lower than it had been for many years. We are now taught that there are various classes of Fevers, having different causes for their origin; which fact if fully borne out, will have practical results. One of these is, Typhus; created by overcrowding and filth, and which having once commenced its existence becomes capable of propagating its kind, where the causes of its creation are not to be found. Another kind owes its origin to decaying organic matter, especially animal matter, and may start up in any locality where this cause is in active operation, just as certainly on the lone hill side, or remote village, as in the most crowded court, or alley. This source of its rise, as we might expect, is most busy in hot weather, when decomposition goes on much more rapidly and continuously. The third is very similar to Typhus, and is closely connected with it as regards cause and result. It like a shadow, invariably follows Famine when passing through a stricken land. Now this division of Fevers may not be so distinct as here stated; for Nature seldom employs definite lines and limits, but shades one thing insensibly into another; still there is doubtless much truth in the theory. In dealing with Sanitary Science, it is well that we should view it, in its broadest aspects; and not fix our minds unduly upon one or two points, however important they may be, and neglect, or pass heedlessly over the rest; if so our career will be halting, and unsatisfactory. Let us then under this consideration, examine the rise and progress of Typhus ; that which during the past year has been so prevalent here, and elsewhere. Want in its innumerable forms, is the most frequent and general cause of this disease, as it is indeed of many others, which do not so plainly claim their parentage; the result of this is, a thorough prostration of the vital powers, which renders the individual peculiarly susceptible to the leception of disease, more especially of epidemic disease. What numbers of families there are in our district, who have sufficient food to sustain life but not equal to the maintaining it in required health, and strength. In Manchester, Typhus Fever began to spread to an unusual extent, but immediately declined as soon as the Relief Committee raised their allowance of money per head, and added a more plentiful distribution of clothing. In all seasons and situations every individual is surrounded by an atmosphere containing organic matter, in a state of decay, and which he prepares and gives off from himself; the quantity of this matter will just be, in proportion to the space he occupies, and the freedom of ventilation present. Now in cold weather, the poor necessarily badly fed, and ill supplied with fuel and clothing; purposely crowd together, and with the utmost care exclude the entrance of the fresh air, because cold; and with the like care prevent the passing out of the foul air, because warm; and thus is formed by respiration, and exhalation, a cloud of this decomposing matter, which possesses the most deleterious qualities. Here consequently is the chosen birth place, and seat of Fever; and here, the victims produce their own destroyer. During the cold of last November, this disease lifted up its head in Preston and neighbourhood, but the liberality of the country intervened, and by a plenteous supply of food and clothing, as at Manchester, crushed it down again. The teaching of all this is, that we wisely relieve distress, the wide spread, and prolific source of disease; and as wisely, carry on sanitary measures for the keeping up the physical, and moral condition of the people.
