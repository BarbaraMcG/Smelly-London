REPORT on The Sanitary Condition of THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the THREE MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31st, 1860. By JOHN LIDDLE, Medial Officer of Health. Read to the Board, Mat 14th, 1860. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, AND 9, LONDON terrace, hackney ROAD, 1860. REPORT. Gentlemen, The mortality in the Whitechapel District for the quarter ending March 31st, a period comprising thirteen weeks, is 734, including 52 non-residents. This amount is greater than in any of the corresponding quarters of the last four years. Thus,—in 1856, the mortality was 631, in 1857, it was 669, in 1858, it was 686, and in 1859, it was 611 The increased mortality (averaging weekly 56.4) in this quarter, may, perhaps, he accounted for, by the protracted and unusual severity of the weather during the months of February and March, when the mean temperature of the air was 38.9. The greatest mortality that occurred in any one week, was in that which ended on the 10th March, when the deaths were 76; it was at this period, that the mean temperature of the air was 27.6, or 4.4 below the freezing point of water. Of the total deaths in this quarter, 394 are males, and 340 females. The births, during the same period, are 737, of which, 393 are males, and 344 females. The excess of births over deaths is therefore only 3, but if we deduct the deaths of the non-residents, (52) the births exceed the deaths by 55. On referring to table No. 6, it will be seen, that the births exceeded the deaths in the districts of the Artillery Ground, Spitalfields, AVhitechapel North, and Goodman's-fields, while in the districts of Whitechapel Church, Mile End New Town, and Aldgate, the deaths exceeded the births. The excess of deaths over births in the Whitechapel Church and the Mile End New Town Districts may be accounted for, by the London Hospital, (in which there were 101 deaths), being situated in the one district, and the Union Workhouse, (iu which there were 115 deaths), being situated in the other district. The only way in which I can account for the excess of deaths over births in the Aldgate District, is upon the supposition, that many of the births are not registered; and in confirmation of this opinion, Mr. Sequeika informs me that several of the children which are brought to him for vaccination have not had their birth registered. 4 Of the 734 deaths, there were 306, or nearly 42 per cent Hinder, 5 years of age, and of these, 165 were of children under one year. If we exclude the total deaths in the London Hospital, the proportion of deaths under 5 are 46.6 per cent. The proportion of deaths of young children varies very much in the several districts; thus, in the Artillery District, where the total deaths are 38, the deaths under 5 years are 15, or 39 per cent; in the Spitalfields District, the total deaths are 89, and the deaths under 5 are 48, or nearly 54 per cent. In the Mile End New Town District, the deaths are 205, and the mortality under 5 is 85, or 41 per cent. In the Whitechapel North District, the mortality is 79, and the deaths under 5 are 33 or 41 per cent. In the Whitechapel Church District, the deaths are 153, and the deaths under 5 are 36, or 23 per cent. In the Goodman's Fields District, the mortality is 81, and the deaths under 5 are 44, or 54 pe>r cent; and in the Aldgate District, the deaths are 89, of which, 45, or nearly 50 per cent, are of children under 5 years of age. The number of inquests are 58, among which, are 16 cases of deaths from the effects of of burns and scalds. The records in some of these cases are truly distressing, inasmuch as, from ordinary care, the accident might have been avoided,—there being no less than 5 of these deaths caused by the clothes of the sufferers catching fire; all of these deaths might have been prevented, if the clothes had been rendered uninfiamable, which may be accomplished by immersing them in various chemical solutions, such as of alum, &c., a plan, which is now occasionally, but ought to be universally, adopted, whenever children are likely to be left without the care of a nurse. Two of the cases of death from burns arose from negligence, by leaving the children in a room with a fire unprotected by a fire-guard. Among the records of the inquests are four deaths from the effects of poison; two of which, were from the taking of muriatic acid, one, from sulphuric acid, and one, from oxalic acid. All these poisons are readily sold at oil-shops and drug-shops. The death of a man aged 50, is recorded as from apoplexy, through inhaling the vapour of spirit in a rum vault in the London Docks. A man aged 22, working in a sugar house, met with his death from a fracture of the skull, occasioned by "a sugar mould of sugar falling upon him, the rope-sling breaking, it being defective." In the case of a newly born child, found dead in Thomas-street, the verdict of "wilful murder" was recorded. Inquests were held on six children, whose death was caused by suffocation in bed; but whether these children were wilfully or accidentally deprived of life, it is difficult to determine. Such cases are of frequent occurrence, and ought to be most rigidly inquired into. Three persons died from the effects of intemperance, viz.— a female aged 54, a male aged 41, and a male aged 50; the latter died a "violent death from drinking intoxicating liquors out of casks in the Docks." A girl six years old, (illegitimate) who resided with her mother, at No. 12, Queen-street, Tower-hill, died suddenly "from exhaustion, from scrofula, and through neglect and want of nourishment." Prom an inquiry which I instituted in this case, I learnt that the mother was frequently drunk; that the room in which she lived was destitute of furniture and in a very filthy condition. The mother wa3 severely reprimanded by the Coroner for her conduct towards the deceased. The uncertified cases of death are 8, viz: 4 (infants) from "convulsions," 1 from "diseased heart," 2 from " inflammation of the chest," and 1 (a child aged 7 months) from 5 The deaths of persons above 80 years of age are 30; of these two had arrived at the advanced age of 90, other two at the ages of 91 and 95 respectively, and one at the great age of 101 years. The principal causes of death are from diseases of the respiratory organs. These diseases, including Phthisis or Consumption, were fatal to 292, a proportion to the total mortality of 39, 3 per cent. Consumption proved fatal to 81 persons, of whom, 65 died between the ages of 20 and 60. Pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs,[numbered 105 victims, Bronchitis or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the lungs, 84. The deaths from violence, exclusive of those from burns and scalds, are 17, of which, 10 are between the ages of 40 and 60. The deaths from epidemic diseases are 88, viz: 12 from small-pox, 12 from measles, 9 from scarlet fever, 12 from hooping-cough, 11 from diarrhoea, 1 from diphtheria, and 31 from fever. In the corresponding quarter of the preceding year, the deaths from epidemic diseases were likewise 88; but the number under each class has varied. Thus in small-pox, diarrhoea, and fever, the number is greater; while in measles, hooping-cough, and scarlet fever, it is less. Two deaths in the London Hospital were occasioned by tetanus or "locked jaw." A case of sudden death occurred in Pieldgate-street, from " rupture of the heart." The deaths in the Workhouse are 115; this is 53 above the number in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. As regards the ages at death in this establishment, there are 31 under 20 years of age, of which number, 20 are infants under one year, 37 are above 60, of which, 8 are upwards of 80 years of age; the remainder, 47, are, of persons in the prime of life, between the ages of 40 and 60. If we exclude the deaths of the 52 non-residents, the proportion of the mortality in the Workhouse is nearly 17 per cent, or 1 in 6 of the total mortality proper to this district. The Medical Officers of the Union attended 3356 new cases of illness. This is 420 above the number for the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. The cases of small-pox were 36, measles 53, scarlet fever 27, hooping-cough 21, diarrhoea 144,, fever 78, and ague 11. On comparing these numbers with those in the corresponding quarter of 1859, it will be seen that, while small-pox, hooping-cough and fever, show a decrease in their numbers; diarrhœa and measles have greatly increased, the former from 88 to 114, and the latter, from 13 to 53. Prom the 3rd to the 17th March, a period.of three weeks, the Medical Oflicers of the Union attended 960 new cases of illness, being a weekly average of 320. The cases of illness in the Workhouse were 549, of which, 277 were attended by Mr. Champnets, and 272 by Mr. Kichardson. These numbers include 12 cases of small-pox, 3 of measles, 4 of hooping-cough, 35 of diarrhœa, and 16 of fever. The cases of illness in the Workhouse for the corresponding quarter of 1859 were 375, including 1 of small pox, 26 of diarrhoea, and 40 of fever. My attention having been directed to the injurious effects of Mercury upon the workmen employed at a large factory in, Spitalfields, where that metal is used in combination with tinfoil for the silvering of looking glasses, 1 visited the premises, and examined two of the workmen who were suffering from the effects of the absorption of the finely divided particles of 6 mercury, which are given off in the process of forming an amalgam by the combination of the mercury with the tin-foil. The proprietor of this large establishment was Very anxious that means should be devised, whereby the injurious effects of the mercury upon the workmen might be prevented, and in order that I might be the better able to suggest a remedy, he kindly showed me the whole of the process of silvering looking glasses. On observing the operation, it appeared to me, that the mercury entered the system of the workmen in two ways,—the one, by friction, the other, by inhalation. With the view, therefore, of protecting those employed in the factory from the absorption of the mercury by the skin; the hands of the operators should be covered with gloves of bladder, or of varnished silk, or leather. These gloves can be easily washed and kept free from the quicksilver. A bath should be erected on the premises, and the men should be required either to use it on leaving off work; or if it should be inconvenient for them to use the bath, they should be required to wash their entire bodies with soap and water. The men on leaving, should change their clothes, which should be well brushed, so as to remove all the particles of quicksilver, before again wearing them. The hands of the workman, if uncovered, should be washed in soap and water several times in the course of day, and the mouth and nostrils should also be frequently cleansed with either warm or cold water. In order to prevent the effects of inhaling the finely divided particles of the quicksilver, it is most essential that a thorough ventilation be established in the factory, so that the fine mercurial dust be carried out of the building, immediately it rises. If these precautions be strictly attended to, it is very probable that the injurious effects of the quicksilver will be prevented. I have sent a copy of these suggestions to the proprietor of the establishment alluded to, with a request, that he will have them printed, and placed in conspicious parts of the factory. The sanitary work in the district is progressing in a very satisfactory manner. During the last three months 459 houses have been inspected in a systematic manner, that is to say, in the form of a house to house visitation, making a total of 5772. The Inspectors have also visited 69 houses, where it was reported that fever existed, and in every instance, where sanitary improvements were required, a notice was served upon the owner to carry them into effect. These orders were in every instance complied with. In consequence of the frequent occurrence of the offence of persons throwing filth into the public way, Mr. Cowakd deemed it necessary to take out a summons against Hannah Jones for throwing fish offal into the street. In this instance, a small penalty in addition to the costs, was inflicted, which I hope will prove a warning to similar offenders. Complaints are still occasionally made of the offensive smell arising from the premises of the bone boilers, in Thomas-street, and Buck's-row. The alterations hitherto effected on the several premises are upon too small a scale to materially abate the nuisance. It^'is therefore necessary that further improvements be carried into effect, to relieve the neighbourhood from the disgusting efHuvia which escape from the carrying on the business. Mr. Oliver, one of the District Surveyors has, in conformity with the 103rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, sent to the Board a list of all the underground rooms, used as sleeping rooms, which are not in conformity with the requirements of the Building Act. All these places have been visited, and in the worst cases, notices have been served upon the landlords to prohibit the tenants from using such rooms as sleeping apartments. 7 Within the last six months, a very large addition has been made to the sewers in the district, viz.: in Church-street and King-street, in the Hamlet of Mile End New Town: in Flower and Deans-treet, George-street, Thrawl-street, Upper and Lower Keate-street, Butlerstreet, Palmer-street, Tilley-street, Tenter-street, Freeman-street, and Wilson's-plaee, in the Parish of Spitalfields : in King-street and Queen-street Tower-hill, in the Parish of Aldgate. All the houses, with two or three exceptions, in the above named streets are now drained into the sewers. The landlords in the exceptional cases have been served with notices to fill up the the cesspools, and connect the premises with the new sewers. As the hot weather is approaching, it will now be more especially necessary for every housekeeper to frequently examine and cleanse the water-butt or cistern which stores the water for domestic use, as many cases of illness are caused by the use of impure water. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. 15, Great Alie Street 14th May, 1860. APPENDIX. TABLE I.

REPORT on The Sanitary Condition of THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, FOR THE THREE MONTHS Ending 30th June, 1860, by JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Health. READ TO THE BOARD, JULY 30th, 1860. LONDON: PRINTED BY MEAD & POWELL, 101, HIGH STREET, WHITECHAPEL, And 6, 7, & 9, Arcade, London Bridge. 1860. QUARTERLY REPORT, Ending 30th June, 1860. Gentlemen, I have now the honour to submit to your notice my Quarterly Report of the Births and Deaths in the District, and of the work accomplished by the Inspectors in the promotion of sanitary improvements. In the last quarter, comprising the thirteen weeks, ending Saturday, June 30th, the total mortality in the Whitechapel District, including the deaths in the London Hospital of 40 non-residents, is 523, viz., 308 males and 215 females. The Births, during the same period, are 668, viz., 331 males and 337 females. The excess of male over female births is only 6, while the deaths of males exceeded those of females by 83. It is estimated that the normal proportion of male births to female is as 106 to 100. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the total births were 715, viz., 390 males and 325 females; the deaths were 448, viz., 257 males and 231 females, including the deaths of 47 non-residents. The Births, therefore, in this quarter are less by 47, and the Deaths greater by 35, than they were in the corresponding quarter of 1859. Estimating the population of the District at 84,000, the present mortality, deducting the deaths of the non-residents (which we are fairly entitled to do, inasmuch as we include in our mortality tables all the deaths in the London Hospital that are occasioned by violence) is 23 in 1,000. This is above the average rate of the mortality in the corresponding quarters of the last three years, the deaths in each quarter being on an average of 466, which is at the rate of 22.2 per 1,000. The increase in the mortality may be attributed to the unusually cold weather that prevailed during the whole of the last three months, when the mean temperature of the air was 50.5, which is about three degrees below that of the corresponding quarters of the three previous years. That the unseasonably cold weather has been the cause of the increased rate of mortality will be readily admitted, when, on comparing the deaths from pulmonary diseases, including consumption (diseases universally acknowledged to be aggravated by cold and damp weather) with the deaths from the same diseases in the corresponding quarters of 1857-8-9, it will be seen that they have increased from 157, 142, and 130 respectively, to 168 in the quarter recently terminated. The deaths from epidemic diseases are, however, fewer than in any of the corresponding quarters of the three preceding years. In 1857 the deaths from epidemic diseases were 73, of which 16 were from fever; in the following year they were 108, of which 20 were from fever; in 1859, the deaths from these diseases were 72, in- 4 eluding 19 from fever; and in the current year they are 64, of which 16 are from fever. The epidemic of small-pox, which prevailed from the commencement of the year 1859 to March, 1860, a period embracing about fifteen months, has now nearly ceased, as two deaths only from this disease have been registered in this district in the last three months. Measles, however, has been remarkably fatal, 15 deaths from this disease having been registered during the quarter. Its ravages are particularly shown in the Aldgate Registration District, where six out of the 15 deaths are registered. The deaths of children under 5 years of age are 219, which, (excluding the 77 deaths in the London Hospital, into which institution very few young children are admitted,) is in the proportion of 49 per cent., or nearly one-half of the total deaths in the district. Including in the total mortality the deaths in the London Hospital, the proportion of deaths of young children is 41.8 per cent. Throughout England the mortality of children under 5 years is 38 per cent. The relative proportion of the deaths, at the several ages, in each registration district, will be seen on referring to the 6th Table in the Appendix. The number of Inquests is 61, in which are included 5 deaths from burns and scalds, 3 from poison, (all females)—one, aged 38, by taking ammonia; but neither the kind nor the dose of the ammonia taken are recorded by the local Registrar; and the other two, aged respectively 38 and 50, the one from an overdose of laudanum taken to relieve pain; the other also from laudanum, but under what circumstances the poison was taken were not ascertained. Inquests were held on the bodies of 5 children under 10 months, and on that of a youth aged 17 years, whose deaths are thus recorded—"suffocated in bed accidentally." In six instances, Inquests were held where it was ascertained that death was either directly or indirectly caused by drunkenness, and verdicts to that effect were recorded. "Exhaustion from debility" is the verdict of a jury in the case of the sudden death of a female aged 66. Two cases of sudden death are recorded as from "Disease of the lungs, greatly accelerated by want of nourishment the one a female aged 44, the other a child aged 6 weeks. The verdict in another case of the sudden death of a child, aged 6 years, is thus recorded—"Inflammation of the lungs, but accelerated by neglect in not procuring medical treatment." An Inquest was held on the body of a child, aged 6 months, when a verdict of "Manslaughter!" was returned against some person or persons unknown. A child, newly-born, is said to have been murdered by some person or persons unknown. Inquests were held on the bodies of twin children, newly born, when the verdicts given were—"Exhaustion from the want of skilled assistance and proper necessaries." Overfeeding and the administration of improper food are recorded as occasioning the death of a child, aged 16 months. I may here observe, that the overfeeding of infants with solid food is a very frequent cause of death; ignorant mothers and nurses not unfrequently cram the stomachs of young children with meat, bread, potatoes, &c., with the occasional addition of beer, and sometimes even of gin. The other Inquests relate principally to cases where death was accidentally caused by violence, and to those where sudden death ensued from disease of the heart; in nearly all of the latter instances post mortem examinations were made, and thus the true cause of death was ascertained. The following cases of death from violence occurred, in which Inquests were not held,—a male child, 7 years of age, from "Concussion of the brain, "stated to have arisen from a fall on the pavement; a child, aged 15 months, from "Fractured thigh through a dray running over him;" a man, aged 48, whose death was occasioned by exhaustion produced by self-mutilation; a male, aged 32, from debility arising from injury to the head; two men, aged respectively 24 and 45, from tetanus, or "locked jaw,"—the one from an injury to the foot, the other from an injury to the hand. "Acute urticaria," or nettle rash, is ascribed as the cause of the death of a child, aged 12 months; a widow, aged 76, died in the London Hospital from chorea. 5 The uncertified cases of death are 7, of which 5 are recorded as having been occasioned by convulsions, and the other two as the result of premature birth. The deaths in the Workhouse are 71, viz., 40 males and 31 females; this is 19 above the number in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The deaths from epidemic diseases are 11, viz., 6 from fever, 3 from diarrhoea, 1 from hooping cough, and 1 from scarlet fever. The Medical Officers of the Union attended 2,730 new cases of sickness, from which return it appears that small-pox has diminished from 96 to 14; fever, from 114 to 61; hooping cough, from 33 to 10; while measles has increased from 28 to 243, of which number Mr. Sequeira attended 167, or more than two-thirds of the entire cases. The average number of fever cases per week, which in the year 1857, was 22 per week, is now reduced to 4.7 per week, and during the three weeks from the Saturday ending June 30th to the Saturday ending July 14th, only 2 cases of fever were attended by the Medical Officers of the Union. This great diminution in the number of fever cases, which has taken place amongst the poor, is an exceedingly gratifying circumstance to all persons concerned in carrying out the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act; for, as considerable improvements have been effected in the sanitary condition of the district, we are I think justified in considering this diminution of fever cases, in a great measure, attributable to these sanitary improvements. The cases of illness in the Workhouse were 482, of which 238 were attended by Mr. Chamfneys, and 244 by Mr. Richardson. The epidemic diseases which are included in the above returns are 47, viz., 4 of small-pox, 3 of measles, 2 of scarlet fever, 2 of hooping cough, 24 of diarrhoea, and 11 of fever. There were also 9 cases of ague, a disease which, of late years, has been very prevalent in this district, 3 of rheumatic fever, and 2 of delirium tremens. The fever cases admitted into the Workhouse appear to have been of a very severe type, as 6, or more than half of those admitted, died. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the cases of illness in the Workhouse were 345, including 14 of fever, 16 of diarrhœa, and 2 of small-pox. The retention of dead bodies in rooms occupied by the poor, in crowded neighbourhoods, until putrefaction is far advanced, is not unfrequently complained of as a nuisance. Two complaints of this nature, one from the north and the other from the south side of the district, have recently been made to me by persons living in close proximity to the houses where a dead body had been so long kept as to become a nuisance. These cases were promptly visited, and the friends of the deceased, in each instance, were impressively told of the danger which was likely to accrue to the neighbourhood by the prolonged retention of the corpse, and they were earnestly requested to inter the body without delay. Chloride of lime was ordered to be sprinkled over the room and passage to lessen the offensive smell. The. orders given in each of these cases were complied with, and consequently no further proceedings were necessary. When a death occurs in a family occupying a single apartment, used both as a sitting and sleeping room, and in which the domestic cooking and washing are conducted, it is of great importance to the surviving members of the family and other inmates of the house, that they should be saved from the danger and inconvenience attending a prolonged retention of the dead body; and I would draw the attention of the Board to the existence of a Legislative enactment which provides a remedy for this evil. In the Act of the 11 and 12 Vic., c 63, called an Act for the Promotion of the Public Health, the 81st sec. provides "That the Local Board of Health may, if they shall think fit, provide, fit up, and make bye-laws, with respect to the management and charges for the use of rooms or premises, in which corpses may be received, and 6 decently and carefully kept previously to interment." The provisions contained in the above recited clause have not, as yet, to the best of my knowledge, been put in practice by any Local Board of Health. The reasons for not doing so are probably in consequence of the expenses that would be entailed upon the ratepayers by the erection of a suitable building, and the annual outlay necessary for the payment of proper officers to take charge of it, and also from the fear that the cost of the interment would not unfrequently be cast upon the local authority, when once the body was removed from the house of the surviving relatives, and deposited in the public building set apart for the reception of the dead previous to interment. The domestic feelings of the poor might also be hurt by the forcible removal of the corpse of a dearly beloved relative to a public receptacle for the dead. The question, however difficult it may be under the present phase of society, is nevertheless one of considerable importance as regards the public health, and is well worthy of the deepest consideration of the public. Complaints of Trades-nuisances have been of frequent occurrence during the quarter. These complaints are a source of great anxiety to your Medical Officer of Health, who, in the discharge of his duty in endeavouring to protect the public health, is compelled, notwithstanding the cost that may be entailed, to urge upon the manufacturer the necessity of making such alterations in his premises as shall tend to prevent the recurrence of the nuisance; yet, at the same time, your Officer of Health is most anxious not to fetter trade to such an extent as to interfere injuriously with the operations of the manufacturer. The Improvements which science is continually suggesting to abate the nuisance arising from the process of manufacturing certain articles of commerce ought, for the promotion of the comfort of the neighbourhood, to be in every instance readily adopted; and it will frequently be found that the offensive products which now contaminate the atmosphere, may, by converting them into something useful, become a source of pecuniary benefit to the manufacturer. The trades-nuisances which have been the most frequently complained of during the quarter are the malt-roasting premises in Bell Lane, Spitalfields, and in Booth Street, Mile End New Town, and the bone-boiling premises of Mr. Smith, in Thomas' Street, Whitechapel. That the nuisance arising from the faulty method in which the business of malt-roasting is conducted is not only a source of great annoyance to the inhabitants, but is injurious to their health. The effects produced by breathing an atmosphere charged with the products of the roasted malt are, cough, headache, sickness, and a smarting pain in the eyes, resulting in some instances in ophthalmia; all these ailments have been experienced by persons living in the vicinity of the factory, and have been made the subject of complaint to your Medical Officer of Health. The chemical works in Buck's Row, where Mr. Gibbs carries on the manufacture of sulphate of soda from the refuse of the distillation of nitric acid, have been a source of annoyance to the inhabitants in the vicinity of the works. The sulphurous aeid vapour which is given off during a portion of the process of the manufacture is exceedingly irritating to the lungs, and is injurious to the health of those persons who have a tendency to disease in those organs. Complaints have also been made of the offensive smell from the reburning of animal charcoal, and of the nuisance from marine store shops, where fat, bones, and old rags are kept. As some of the sugar bakers reburn animal charcoal without occasioning a nuisance, it is obvious that in those premises where a nuisance arises, the best practicable means are not used to destroy the offensive vapour. The nuisance arising from the marine store shops might be greatly mitigated if the several articles from which an offensive smell was likely to arise were kept in well-closed 7 casks, and removed, after a few days, from the premises, before decomposition took place. The casks should be removed in bulk without disturbiug their contents. Chloride of lime should be freely used, and the greatest possible cleanliness observed. The walls of the apartment in which the materials likely to become offensive are stored should be frequently limewhited, and no greater quantity of such materials should at any time be kept on the premises than is absolutely necessary for the carrying on of the business. A nuisance occasioned by the storing of a large quantity of German cheese (a cheese emitting a very offensive smell) in a cellar belonging to the proprietor of a chandler's shop, in Commercial Street, was made a subject of complaint. I visited the premises in question, and directed that only one box should be opened at a time, and that those not in use be kept excluded from the air, the walls to be limewhited, chloride of lime to be freely used, and the greatest possible cleanliness observed. Whilst on the subject of trades-nuisances, I may mention that a memorial, signed by several of the parishioners in Trinity, Minories, was presented to your Board, in which memorial it was stated that considerable danger to life and property was apprehended from there being stored in certain premises, in Sheppy Yard, a large quantity of methylated spirit (a compound of spirits of wine of not less degree of strength than 50 per cent. and wood naphtha, or methylic alcohol, in the proportion of nine of the former to one of the latter). In consequence of this memorial, your Board instituted proceedings against the proprietors of the premises in question ; on those proceedings, a penalty of £5 was inflicted upon the defendants, the magistrates being of opinion that the business was of a dangerous character. As to the work done in promotion of sanitary improvements in the district, I have to report that the Inspectors have visited, in the form of a house to house visitation, 455 houses, making a total visited up to the present time of 6,234. Many more than the number above specified have been visited, although not in the same systematic manner, and the same house has in several instances been visited four or five times, in consequence of the recurrence of a nuisance; in short, there are many places which require the almost constant supervision of the Inspectors. The full details of the sanitary work done by the Inspectors will be seen on referring to the Tables 1, 2, and 10 in the Appendix, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. 15, Great Alie Street, 19th July, 1860.

REPORT on The Sanitarn Condition of THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the THREE MONTHS ENDING 29th SEPT., 1860. By JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Health Read to the Board, Nov. 12th, 1860. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, and 9, london terrace, hackney road. 1860. QUARTERLY REPORT, Ending 39th September, 1860. Gentlemen, In presenting my Report for the Quarter terminating on Saturday, the 29th September, 1860, I have the satisfaction to state that the sanitary condition of the Whitechapel District is comparatively good, whether it be judged of by the mortality returns, or by the cases of sickness which have been attended by the Medical Officers of the Union. The average number of deaths in July, August and September, in the four preceding years is 558, while the deaths during the same months of this year are only 515, viz. 295 males, and 220 females, including the deaths of 30 non-residents. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the mortality was 624, or 109 above that in the period now under consideration. The births in the quarter are 645, viz, 338 males, and 307 females; the number in the corresponding quarter of 1859 was nearly the same, viz. 648. The weekly average of births is 49.7, and o deaths 39.8; but if we deduct the deaths of the non-residents, the weekly average is only 37.3. How far this diminished rateof mortality may be accounted for by the meteorological conditions of the atmosphere, I cannot determine; but, in concurrence with this comparatively low rate of mortality, the mean temperature of the air, according to the returns made to the Registrar General by the Astronomer Royal, was only 56.8 degrees, which is 5 degrees less than the average of the four corresponding quarters 1856-9, and 6 degrees less than it was during the same period of 4 last year. If, therefore, the unusually cold weather, accompanied as it has been by the excessive number of wet days, has been productive of injury to the cereal crops, it would seem to have exerted a beneficial influence on the atmosphere, as is shown by the diminished rate of mortality from epidemic diseases; for, instead of there being 201 deaths from this class of diseases, the number recorded in the corresponding period of 1859, they are reduced to 111, or nearly one-half. Diarrhoea, which proved fatal to 114 persons in the summer quarter of last year, of which number, 70 were children under one year of age, has been fatal in only 35 instances, in 15 of which the victims were under one year of age. The average number of deaths from Diarrhœa in the corresponding quarters of 1856 to 1859 is 86, excluding in each instance the deaths from Cholera, which, in 1857, were 6, in 1858, 4, in 1859, 5, while, in the quarter just ended, not a single death from Cholera is recorded. Fever has also declined from 28 to 11,* Scarlet Fever from 28 to 8; Small-pox from 16 to 2. On the other hand, the deaths from Measles have increased from 10 to 39, and Hooping Cough from 4 to 16. On referring to the table showing the deaths from Epidemic Diseases in each sub-district, it will be seen that the deaths from Measles have been very unequally distributed among them, thus, in the Aldgate sub-district, with a population of 10,694, there are 13 deaths; in the Goodman's Fields sub-district, in a population of 12,069, there are 11 deaths; and in the Whitechapel North, in a population of 12,530, there are 11 deaths; whereas in the Artillery, Spitalfields, Whitechapel Church, and Mile End New Town subdistricts, containing together a population of 24,406, Measles was fatal in only 4 instances. On referring to the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, I find that in the East London Union, or that portion of the City which is adjacent to the North-western extremity of the Whitechapel District, containing a population of 44,593, there were 16 fatal cases of Measles, which is a proportion of less than one-half than in those districts in Whitechapel where Measles prevailed; while, in a sub-district of a Parish adjoining Whitechapel on the South eastern side, in a population of 18,067, the deaths from Measles were 29, which is a rate of mortality four times greater than in the East London Union, and nearly twice as great as in any of the sub-districts of Whitechapel. The coldness and dampness of the atmosphere, caused by the heavy rain-fall in May and June, had the efiect of completely saturating the soil, and which saturation was kept up by the unusual number of wet days in the three months following, have increased the mortality, as might have been anticipated, from pulmonary diseases. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, exclusive of consumption, are 62; while, in the corresponding quarters of 1857-8-9, they were 46, 64, and 44. The deaths from Consumption, which during the same periods, ranged from 51 to 76, are 64. The coldness of the season, therefore, has not been unfavorable to those predisposed to this disease. Not a single death from Diphtheria, or from childbirth is recorded ; Croup, however, has been unusually developed, 17 children under 5 yean having fallen victims to its effects. Congenital Syphilis, * A fatal case of Fever, and one of Scarlet Fever occurred in the London Hospital. Both of these patients were non-residents. 5 the inheritance of children from their diseased parents, was fatal in two instances. Alcoholism, or Intemperance destroyed 4; but, it cannot be doubted that the abuse of intoxicating drinks has been the cause of death in many more instances than in those recorded by the local registrars. Tha deaths of 4 children were caused by suffocation in bed; in one of these cases, the parents were drunk at the time. There were 2 deaths from destitution, 2 from drowning, and 1 from a wound of the throat (suicide). The deaths from burns and scalds were 8, and from violence of various kinds 19. The total number of inquests was 56, of which, 32 were held on persons who died in the London Hospital. The deaths uncertified by a medical practitioner are 13, 1 of which, is that of an infant suffocated during the time of its birch. The deaths in the Workhouse are 61, viz. 29 males and 22 females. In the corresponding quarter of the preceding year the deaths in the Workhouse were 62. The cases of sickness in the Workhouse were 390, of which, 189 were attended by Mr. Champneys, and 201 by Mr. Richardson. Included in the above returns aro 31 cases of Epidemic Diseases, viz. 2 of Scarlet Fever, 1 of Hooping Cough, 17 of Diarrhoea, and 11 of Fever. These returns, both as regards the total number and the number of Epidemic Diseases included in each return, contrast very favorably with the returns for the corresponding quarter of the preceding year, when the total was 411, including 72 cases of Epidemic Disease. The same favorable returns are shown in the total cases attended among the out-door poor (3261 against 2668), The returns of Diarrhoea cases show a reduction of more than one-half, viz. from 787 to 383; of Fever, from 107 to 34 ; of Small-pox, from 44 to 6; of Scarlet Fever, from 70 to 24 ; Measles, on the other hand, shows an increase from 78 to 159. On perusing the table showing the causes of death at seven periods of life registered in the Whitechapel District, and comparing it with that of the corresponding quarter of 1859, it will be seen that the deaths of children under 1 year of age are less numerous by 59; the deaths recorded in the 1st table being 121, out of a total mortality of 515 or in the proportion of 23'4 per cent., and in the other table, the number under 1 year is 180 out of a total of 624, or in the proportion of 28.9 per cent. This diminution of the infant mortality appears to be owing to the comparative immunity from Diarrho3a, that this District together with the entire Metropolis has enjoyed during the summer; for Diarrhoea, when epidemic, is always particularly fatal to children of tender years. The deaths of children under 12 months from Diarrhoea, in the summer of 1859, were 70, out of a total mortality from this cause of 114, which is at the rate of 61'4 per cent., while in the summer of 1860 the total deaths from Diarrhoea were only 35, and the mortality of children under 12 months was 15, or 42.8 per cent. This diminution in the amount of infant mortality is, at first sight, very gratifying, but if we compare the total deaths under 5 recorded in these two tables, it will be seen, that the mortality under 5 years of age, during the quarter recently terminated, bears a much larger proportion to the total mortality than in the corresponding quarter of the preceding year; the one being 53.3 per cent. and the other 49'5 per cent. of the total mortality. The excessive proportionate mortality of children under 5 years of age, which has recently taken place, is owing to Measles, HoopingCough, Croup, and diseases of the respiratory organs. The children under 5 residing in the Whitechapel North sub-district, have suffered more in proportion than in any other of the sub- 6 districts, the deaths under 5 being 55 out of a total mortality of 71, which is at the rate of 77.4 per cent. The births in this sub-district were 91. It therefore appears that 60 per cent. of those born in this sub-district, perished before they reached the age of 5 years. This disproportionate mortality of children in the Whitechapel North sub-district is very startling, it is certainly unnatural, and it therefore demands our most serious attention. Although the neglect of the ordinary sanitary laws proves especially fatal to the young, yet, other agents are most probably in operation to produce this excessive mortality. The great death rate of young children, which is observed in all our large towns and populous districts, is owing to other causes besides the non-observance of the rules of ordinary Hygeine; among which may be mentioned, the immorality, dissipation, and improvidence of the parents, maternal neglect, want of proper food, the undue exposure of children to the cold and wet without protecting them with sufficient clothing, a spectacle frequently to be seen in our public streets, the leaving of children of tender age in the charge of other children who are totally incapable of taking care of them; the administration of narcotic drugs, and the delay in not procuring medical advice in the first stage of disease. Notwithstanding that every possible facility of obtaining the best medical advice is afforded to the poor of this district, as is shown by the large returns of the Medical Officers of the Union, and by those of the other medical charities in the district, yet, it must be apparent, that whilst mothers are obliged to devote all their time to that occupation by which they are alone enabled to obtain food, &c., for themselves and families, they are apt to neglect the first symptoms of disease in their children, and do not apply for medical advice until it is too late to be of any benefit to them. Every medical man practising in poor neighbourhoods can bear testimony to the fact of children being brought to his surgery for advice, when the sufferer is just at the point of death, and the next time that the medical man sees the parent of the sick child, he is asked for a certificate of the cause of its death, the child having in the interim died. It must be apparent to every one who has devoted any attention to the eircumstauces of the poor, and has observed the difficulties which surround them in their struggles to obtain the means of subsistence, that they are to be pitied rather than blamed for the neglect of their offspring, whereby so much suffering and early death result; and it must be equally apparent to such observer that these calamities will not be mitigated to any extent until means are devised for the more profitable employment of the labouring population, and by diffusing among them an extended system of elementary and practical knowledge. From the annual return of the number of cases Taccinated by the public vaccinators in the Union, prepared by Mr. Farr, it appears that the number of children under 1 year of age succesfully vaccinated, during the year ending 29th September, was 2004. This number is 751 less than the registered births. In the preceding year, the cases of successful vaccination of children under 1 year of age were 2197 or 632 less than the births registered in the same period; and in 1858 the ca6es were 1599, or 1184 less than the registered births. Vaccination is therefore becoming more extended. It will be seen on referring to the tables setting forth the sanitary improvements that have been effected during the quarter that the inspectors have visited, in a systematic manner, 7 786 houses. These are exclusive of those which the inspectors have visited where Fever has prevailed or where nuisances have existed. I am happy to say that the house-to-house visitation in the district is now nearly completed, and I expect, in my next report, to be able to state that every house, whether inhabited by the rich or by the poor, has been inspected, and information respecting the drainage of each house has been obtained. It has been a subject of remark at this Board, that the house-to-house visitation might have been finished before the reading of my previous report, but permit me to observe that if the 83,942 nuisances which have been removed were to be particularized, or in other words, given in detail, it would be seen that this number, large as it is, would have been increased more than twofold. The time involved in getting rid of a single nuisance is sometimes very considerable, so many as 13 visits being required when a summons is taken out for compelling the filling up of a cesspool and the making of a proper drainage into the sewer. The advantages attending the system of a house-to-house visitation are very great, and it is most important for the general welfare, that so soon as all the houses in courts and other confined neighbourhoods have been visited, that they should be systematically re-inspected, as nuisances in these localities are constantly recurring. It has been alleged that unless complaints are made, it is not necessary to inspect the interior of the houses in poor localities, but every one, who has had any experience of the habits of the poor, knows that it is a very rare thing indeed for them to complain ; for it too frequently happens that they cannot pay their rent, and therefore dare not make a complaint, from the fear of being compelled to leave their apartment, and from the difficulty they experience in obtaining another. District visitors and clergymen might render essential service towards improving the sanitary condition of the abodes of the poor, by giving information to the Officers of the Board, whenever they observe such nuisances, as in their opinion, are prejudicial to health. The special attention of the Board has latterly been directed to the nuisances arising from premises used by cow-keepers. This subject is one which, in a sanitary point of view, claims the serious consideration, not only of the Board, but of the individuals themselves, who are engaged in that description of business; for it must be borne in mind that milk is a most important article of general comsumption in the metropolis, forms the principal part of the diet of children, and is largely consumed by invalids. The excellence of milk must of course be dependent upon the healthy condition of the animals from which it is derived, and its more or less nutritious properties are, in a great measure, owing to the care and attention bestowed upon the animals in keeping them in a state of cleanliness and comfort. It must not be forgotton that stalled cows, for months and even years together, never see a green field, nor even move from the stall in which they are confined; that, unlike horses, they are deprived of exercise, and they are also deprived of, what is of the utmost importance to the maintenance of their health, the free enjoyment of fresh air. In consequence of the complaints, which have from time to time been made to the Board, of the offensive smells proceeding from premises used for the keeping of cows, I was directed to visit the premises complained of, with a view of suggesting such improvements as would lead to the mitigation of the evils; but, before making a report upon the subject,I deemed it expe- 8 dient to make a systematic and complete visitation of all cow-houses within the district, for the purpose of ascertaining, from personal inspection, the general condition of the animals and of the places where they are kept. In my visits, I was accompanied by your Inspectors of Nuisances, and a tabular statement has been drawn up by Mr. Coward of the results of the investigation. From that statement it appears, that there are 33 premises within the district in which cows are kept, that the total number of cows then amounted to 412, that in one instance, the space for each cow was only 180 cubic feet. I may here mention, that for the preservation of health, it is estimated that a human being requires a space of at least 300 cubic feet, and that space to be so ventilated as to allow every proper facility for the renewal of the atmospheric air, and I may further state, that it is estimated that a cow will consume or vitiate as much air as five adult human beings. The premises in the district where cows are kept, are for the most part badly paved, many are badly drained and indifferently ventilated, and some are in a disgracefully dirty condition. I have also observed in some, not only the absence of cleanly arrangements with regard to the animals, but the grains and other food are placed in close proximity to the manure pit which is situated under the same shed, so that the animals inhale the gas given off from an accumulation of their own excrement. Many of the cows had also a dirty appearance. This is not natural to the animals, for when at large in the open field, few animals have a more cleanly appearance than cows; but their dirty condition when in confinement, arises from neglect on the part of the owner in not removing the dung and filth from the stall, so that when the animal lies down, its legs and body became clotted with dirt. This is not only abominable but it is positively disgraceful to the cow-keeper, for it can be easily prevented by proper attention to cleanliness; moreover it is injurious to the health of the animal, for under these circumstances, the skin cannot properly perform itsfunctions. It also appears that the manure is, in many instances, not removed until the lapse of considerable intervals, varying from one day to seven days, and if I could judge from appearances, even for a much longer period. The prolonged retention of the manure even for two days in confined neighbourhoods is exceedingly objectionable from the nuisance that is occasioned by the stirring up the putrid filth, and tainting the atmosphere to a considerable distance. By the proposed amendments in the Metropolis Local Management Act, it is contemplated to provide that all cow-houses shall be licensed in the same manner as slaughterhouses are now licensed, and it will then, of course, be the particular duty of your sanitary officers to insist upon more ample provision being made for the proper keeping of cows, when I shall feel called upon to suggest a proper code of rules applicable to the details of the business. In the meantime, however, there is no reason why cleanliness and such other simple and necessary regulations as common prudence and care demand should not be at once enforced, as such regulations will operate not only to protect the general sanitary condition of the immediate vicinity of the premises occupied, but will tend to the benefit and advantage of the proprietors in their trade; for it must be obvious to all, that the health, cleanliness, and general good condition of the animals must form an important element towards the success of their business. With these views I have submitted to the Board that certain suggestions should be 9 made to the cow-keepers in the district. These suggestions, which involve only the absolute necessaries, cleanliness and a proper supply of air, the Board have already assented to : they are as follows:- REGULATIONS FOR COW-HOUSES. 1.—Every cow-house shall be paved with flag paving or other non-absorbent material, set and bedded in cement, with a proper inclination to the foot of the stalls, so as to drain into a channel leading by a fall of not less than l½-inches in 10-feet to a trapped gulley. 2.—Every cow-house 6hall be provided with a proper trapped drain to convey fluid matter alone into the sewers. 3.—Every cow-house shall be furnished with an adequate supply of water, and be washed thoroughly at least once a day. 4.—All solid manure and refuse shall be carefully swept up twice a day, be kept under cover, and be carted away early every morning. 5.—Every cow-house shall be kept in proper condition, and the walls be limewashed at least 4 times a year. 6.—Every cow-house shall have a sufficient space for each cow, and shall be properly lighted and ventilated. 7.—Every yard, in which a cow-house is situated, shall be well paved with stone or other impervious material, shall be properly drained, and shall be washed at least once a day. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. Board op Works, 15, Great Alie Street. 10th November, 1860. APPENDIX. TABLE I.

FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT on The Santary Condition of THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, for the YEAR ENDING 29th DECEMBER, 1860. By JOHN LIDDLE, Medical Officer of Health. Read to the Board, Feb. 11th, 1861. LONDON: PRINTED BY T. PENNY, 121, LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL, and 9, london terrace, hackney road. 1860. ANNUAL REPORT, Ending 29th December, 1860. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you a Report on the Health of the Whitechapel District during the year 1860, and on the sanitary improvements which have been effected therein during that period. From the returns of the local registrars, transmitted to me weekly, through the kindness of the Registrar General, it appears that 2302 persons, including 163 non-residents, have died within the District in the fifty-two weeks which terminated on Saturday, the 29th December, 1860, of which number, 1260 were males, and 1042 females. The births, during the same period, were 2746, viz. 1426 males, and 1320 females. The excess of births over deaths, excluding the non-residents, is C07. During the previous year, the deaths were 2321, including 189 non-residents. The mortality is, therefore, nearly the same during the past year, as it was in the preceding year; and it represents an annual death-rate of 25 per 1000, The births in 1860 are less by 80 than they were in 1859. In the quarter terminating on the 29th December, the births were 696, of which, 364 were males, and 332 females, and the deaths, including 41 non-residents, were 530, viz. 263 males, and 267 females. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the births were 704, and the deaths, including the non-residents, (41, the same number), were 598. The births, therefore, are less by 8, and the deaths less by 68, as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year; and not only is the total mortality less, but the deaths from epidemic diseases, that class of diseases, which is generally admitted to be kept under control by sanitary regulations, have diminished from 118 to 81; and if we compare the tables, showing the deaths from these diseases, in the corresponding quarters of 1859 and 1860, it will be seen that the deaths from fever, hitherto the great scourge of this district, are less by one-half, viz. 11 against 22. The mortality from small-pox has diminished from 23 to 5, scarlet fever from 40 to 15; while the deaths from hooping-cough have increased from 1 to 12. The total decrease in the number of deaths in the entire class of zymotic diseases during the quarter, is 30, viz. 103 against 113. But the most interesting fact shown in the mortality tables, and in the tables of sickness, during the last five years, is, that the deaths from fever, and the cases of illness from this disease, have annually diminished. Thus, in 1856, the deaths from fever were 188, and the cases which were attended by the Medical Officers of the Union, during the same period, were 1929; in 1857, the deaths were 117, and the cases 1441; in 1858, the deaths were 104, and the cases 590; in 1859, the deaths were 93, and the cases 411; and in 1860, the deaths were only 69, and the cases 190. The amount of suffering which so many of the poor have escaped, by this diminution of the number of fever cases, in the course of the last five years, is beyond my powers of description; but some estimate of it may be formed, when we reflect, that the average duration of a case of fever is about four weeks, and that during the progress of the disease the agony that is indured is sometimes intense. 4 A severe case of typhus fever, which terminates in the recovery of the patient, lasts from five to six weeks. The annual diminution in the number of fever cases may, I think, be fairly attributed to the additions that have from time to time been made to the sewerage of the district; (the particulars of which may be seen on referring to the Surveyor's reports)—to the improvements that have been effected in the drainage of 2172 houses—to the abolition of 3002 cesspools—to the better paving of many of the courts—to the systematic inspection of every house where fever prevailed, and the enforcement, in each instance, of such sanitary measures as were deemed necessary to prevent the spread of the disease—to the removal of 37,607 nuisances—to the total abolition of several offensive trades-nuisances, and the abatement of the nuisances from several other offensive trades, especially those arising from the returning of animal charcoal, from the bone-boiling premises, and from other establishments where animal matter is manufactured into articles of commerce—also to the filling up of the vaults under the churches and chapels where the dead had been deposited—to the improvements that have been effected in the several slaughter houses—to the better ventilation of some of the poor localities by the pulling down of old and dilapidated houses — and to the other sanitary improvements whieh are recorded in the tables in the Appendix to this report. Although great improvements have been effected within this district in the drainage of the houses, by means of impermeable pipes communicating with the main sewers, yet, from the imperfect manner in which several of the old sewers are constructed, and from the defects which are frequently found in some of the house drains, the emanations from the sewers occasionally find their way into the basements of the houses, and rapidly become diffused over the entire house. When the basement of a house is not properly ventilated, so that a current of air does not pass along it, the air in this part of the house is wanner than that in the sewer, and consequently a ready ingress is afforded to the foul gases of the sewer when the drain is imperfect and not well trapped; and it frequently happens that in consequence of these neglects, persons occupying the basement of a house, lose their health, and sometimes become victims of fever, and of other diseases, produced by the inhalation of air charged with the products of decomposing organic matter. The importance of attending to the thorough veutilation of the basement of houses cannot he over-rated. The deaths from epidemic diseases in the year are 344, or 16.9 per cent. of the total mortality; while in the preceding year, they were 471, or 20 per cent. of the total mortality. The deaths from consumption are 253, or 20 less than the preceding year. The total number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs is 491, viz. 211 in the quarter ending on the 30th March, 101 in the succeeding quarter, 67 in the quarter ending on the 29th September, and 112 in the quarter ending on the 29th December. In the preceding year, the total deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs were 377. The excessive cold weather, which'prevailed during' the last two weeks of the year, proved particularly fatal to those predisposed to, or suffering from, disease of the respiratory organs. The Registrar General remarks, that during the week terminating on the 29th Dec., the temperature of the air was 11 degs. below the average of the same week during a period of 43 years. The greatest degrees of cold were on Tuesday, the 25th, and on Saturday, the 29th December, when the thermometer stood at 8° and 10°, or 24 and 22 degrees respectively, below the freezing point of water. The melancholy effects of this extremely cold weather will be seen in the mortality returns of the next quarter, when the weak, the aged, the badly fed and clothed, will be found to have succumbed in great numbers to the depressing influence of the severe frost. Young persons who are in robust health, if well fed and clothed, and able to take vigorous exercise in open air, may enjoy what is sometimes called seasonable weather, but the returns of the Registrar General show that the prolonged continuance of the cold weather is invariably followed by an increased mortality. The total number of inquests held during the year was 220. In the last quarter the number was 45. Of these, eight were cases of burns and scalds; one of which, was that of a child, aged three years, from drinking hot water from a tea kettle; five were cases of suffocation, of which, two were of children under one year of age, and illegitimate, who were suffocated in bed; one of these deaths occurred in the workhouse, the child was six months old. One of the deaths from suffocation is thus recorded: "Suffocation from natural causes, a child 5 aged five years." This record is certainly very vague, but it probably means that the cause of death was croup or laryngitis. Another of the cases is that of a widow, aged 43, who was "found dead," and her death is recorded to have been caused by "suffocation, accelerated by weakness through want of the necessaries of life.'' The remaining case was that of a man who was accidently suffocated in a charcoal cistern. A child aged seven months was poisoned by opium, by misadventure, an overdose having been given to cause sleep. A child aged ten days was wilfully murdered by some person or persons unknown. A child, in the Workhouse, newly born, and illegitimate, met with its death from inj uries to the head from a fall. The other inquests call for no particular remark; they relate to cases of sudden death from natural causes, in the majority of which, the true cause of death was ascertained by a post mortem examination; and to deaths accidently caused by violence. The number of deaths uncertified by a medical practitioner is 16. The total number during the year is 44, or 1.9 per cent of the total mortality. The deaths in the Workhouse are 45, viz. 20 males, and 25 females; these deaths include three from fever, two from diarrhoea, and one from scarlet fever. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the mortality was 63. The total number of deaths in the year is 232. The mortality in the preceding year was 239. The deaths of children under five years of age during the quarter, are 245, or 46'2 per cent. The mortality under five during the year was 1045, or 45/3 per cent, of the total number of deaths. The cases of illness attended by the Medical Officers of the Union, exclusive of those in the Workhouse, were 2638, and the number during the year was 11,392. The number in the preceding year was 11,701. The cases of illness in the Workhouse during the quarter were 393, of which, Mr. Champneys attended 173, and Mr. Richardson 220. Included in these returns, there are one case of small-pox, two of scarlet fever, one of hooping cough, fourteen of diarrhoea, and nine of fever. The total number of cases of illness in the Workhouse during the year was 1677, including 50 cases of fever. In the preceding year, the total number was 1625, including 110 cases of fever; the number of fever cases, therefore, which occurred during the past year, are less by one-half than the number in the preceding year. Several cases ofcolica pictonum, or lead poisoning, occurred in the district during the quarter; three of these eases were workmen employed in a lead factory in Bethnal Green. As this factory is out of my jurisdiction, I directed the attention of Mr. Pearce, the Medical Officer of Health for that district, to the circumstance. Mr. Pearce promptly inspected the lead works in question, and he informed me, that he had suggested that a hood should be put over the copper that is used for melting the lead, and that the workmen should be directed to wash their faces and hands in water containing a solution of sulphuret of potassium. A death is recorded from peritonitis, induced by lead poisoning. The only registration district in which deaths from small-pox occurred during the quarter, is the Spitalfields district, where no less than five deaths from this disease are recorded; and out of the nine cases of small-pox attended by the Medical Officers of the Union during the same period, eight of the cases came under the care of Mr. Blackwell, the Medical Officer for the Spitalfields District. In nearly all the cases of death and of illness from small-pox, which have recently occurred, the patients had not been vaccinated. In some instances, the parents expressed themselves as strongly opposed to vaccination; in other instances they appear to imagine that this disease is a special visitation of Providence, and that it is man's lot to be affected with it once during life, and the earlier in life the disease occurs the better it will be for the patient. The fatal effects of the ignorance thus developed are not to be overcome by putting in force the compulsory clauses of the Vaccination Act; for it is not by compulsion, that vaccination, the only known preventive of small-pox, will become general; but when education is more extensively diffused among the people, it is probable, that these ancient and absurd prejudices will be overcome, and that the grand discovery of Dr. Jeuner will be universally adopted. It appears that the streets where the greatest number of epidemic diseases were attended by the District Surgeon, are Phoenix Street, Great Pearl Street, Quaker Street, and Grey Eagle Street. It is therefore to these places that the attention of the Inspector has been particularly directed; and from the sanitary improvements which have been 6 recently effected therein, I anticipate that during the ensuing quarter, a less amount of disease will be found to prevail. It is manifest that here some local cause must ho in operation to produce this excessive amount of sickness, for if these diseases were produced hy any general atmospheric cause, it is most probable that their malignant effects would be extended over a much larger area. Although the cause of epidemic diseases is still involved in mystery, yet we know that in those places where sanitary regulations are disregarded, the severity of all these diseases is increased. It appears that the sewers in the above-mentioned streets are very defective, but as the Board has given orders for the thorough repair of them, we may reasonably expect that the health of the neighbourhood will be further improved, when, in addition to the more general improvements already carried into effect by order of the Inspector, the still better drainage of each house shall have been effected. As I am indebted for information respecting sanitary defects in certain houses and localities to the Medical Officers of the Union, and to the Relieving Officers, I here tender to them my best thanks for the same; and I trust, that not only shall I continue to receive information upon this subject from the Officers of the Union, but that all persons, who are engaged in visiting the poor, will kindly inform me of any matter, which, in their opinion, is likely to prove injurious to the health of the district. During the last three months the Inspectors have systematically inspected 817 houses, of which number, 109 have been twice visited; the majority of these latter being in Colchester Street, and the streets adjoining, where new sewerage has been recently constructed. Nearly 2000 nuisances have been removed, very many of these requiring four or five visits from the Inspectors in consequence of the filthy habits of some of the inhabitants of the worst localities; such as Wilson's Place, Goulston Court, Marlborough Court, Miller's Court, Goodwin's Buildings, &c. The filthy habits are unfortunately not confined to the people inhabiting the poorest localities, but some of the houses in Duke Street, which is a respectable thoroughfare and well drained, require regular supervision, in consequence of the nuisance caused by the stoppage of the syphons. In several places in the district, the inhabitants are in the constant habit of throwing the contents of their chamber utensils into the dust-bins, thereby occasioning a disgusting nuisance when these receptacles are emptied by the Dustmen. I have again to record two more cases of the prolonged retention of the dead. One of these cases was that of a female infant, who died from hooping-cough, and the dead body was kept nearly three weeks in a room occupied by the parents and four children. The other case was also that of a child, whose dead body had been kept during fifteen days in a room occupied by the other members of the family. Both these cases occurred in Mile End New Town, and so soon as the Inspector received information respecting them he took immediate steps to obtain the interment of the bodies. The law upon this subject is very defective and requires amendment. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LIDDLE. Board of Works, 15, Great Alie Street. APPENDIX. TABLE I.
