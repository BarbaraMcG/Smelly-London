Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1952 E. GRUNDY, M.D., M.R.C.S., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health BOROUGH OF WEMBLEY ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the Year 1952 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for 1952. This Report has been compiled in the following five chapters, four with a statistical appendix, in which the figures relating to the functions of the Public Health Department have been collected together according to the relevant services.

Statistical Appendix D, Pages 34—45. ., ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEPARTMENT AND STAFF, Page 46. 3 CHAPTER I. VITAL STATISTICS. 1. The population of the Borough in mid-1952 was estimated by the Registrar General to be 130,100 and whilst this is considerably below 131,369 the preliminary census figure for 1951 it probably represents the most accurate figure attainable. It is an interesting observation that the population of Wembley and Kingsbury recorded in the census of 1931 was some 65,799, an inter-census increase of 99.7%. Wembley remains the fifth largest County District in Middlesex, those greater, according to population, being Harrow, Ealing, Willesden and Hendon. 2. In 1952 there were recorded 1,521 live births, giving a birth rate of 11.69 per thousand of the estimated population. The number of deaths was 1,204 giving a crude death rate of 9.25 per thousand. When the comparability factor (1.16) is applied the standardised death rate becomes 10.73, a decrease on last year's figure and below the national rate of 11.3 per thousand of the population. 3. The infantile mortality rate of 24.33 showed a slight rise over the figure of 1951 but is still below the national rate for England and Wales yet it demands some attention. Prematurity of birth and congenital malformation are the main causes of death in very young infants and an emergency unit is maintained at the Edgware General Hospital which can be called to the house when a premature birth occurs to give immediate and skilled attention prior to removal if necessary to hospital. 4. During the year there was no death from maternal causes and I am content to draw attention to the Maternal Mortality Rate of nil. 4 STATISTICAL APPENDIX A.

GENERAL HEALTH SERVICES. 1. HOSPITALS. The whole of Wembley lies within the area of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board but hospitals accepting the sick are administered by two Hospital Management Committees, the Central Middlesex Group Hospital Management Committee and the Hendon Group Hospital Management Committee, the two major general hospitals being the Central Middlesex Hospital and the Edgware General Hospital. The Wembley Hospital and the Kingsbury Maternity Hospital are situated in the Borough and these hospitals are under the control of the Governors of Charing Cross Hospital. Infectious diseases are normally accepted at the Neasden Hospital or, in case of necessity, at the Hendon Isolation Hospital. Cases of mental deficiency and mental disease are catered for at Shenley and Napsbury Hospitals. Arrangements made for the admission of tuberculous patients to a variety of hospitals through the three Chest Clinics serving the area.

Only 6 cases, 4 adults and 2 school children were referred to Kensington Medicinal Baths for treatment more intensive than could be given at the Clinics or in the homes. The generalisation remains true that infestation is scarcely a Public Health problem in Wembley. The response of the mothers to the advice given through the School Health Services is most gratifying. 14 5. MORTUARY. The public mortuary which was built a good many years ago at a time when the population was under 20,000, has continued to meet the needs of the district. That this has been possible is partly due to the provision in recent years of a refrigerated chamber which has proved of inestimable benefit. Neverthless, the time cannot be too far off when a new mortuary planned on present-day standards of lay-out and equipment will have to be provided. 166 bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year, the majority of which were on orders from the Coroner so that post-mortem examinations could be made. 15 STATISTICAL APPENDIX B.

There is little to note in this Section for the year, as the absence of any unusual infectious disease and the lack of any major outbreak of notifiable disease have not occasioned serious concern during the year. The incidence of common infections of infancy varies slightly from time to time and the figures in the statistical appendix indicate that the experience in 1952 was not unusual or in any way adverse. An interesting outbreak of disease occurred in the family of an importer of tropical birds. The husband was taken suddenly ill with extreme exhaustion and collapse accompanied by feverish symptoms and headache; he later devoloped bronchitis. His wife made application for a home help to assist with the domestic work and the patient was taken to hospital at the end of a week. Information was volunteered that many of the birds recently imported by this man had died and others were sick requiring the constant attention of his wife. It seemed possible that the patient was suffering from Psittacosis, a disease transmitted from the parrot species to humans, and a full bacteriological investigation was undertaken but results were inconclusive. Some six days later the wife collapsed and suffered with severe headache and disturbance of vision. Investigations again were not absolutely conclusive but it appears that both were infected by the imported birds. Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country and the Parrots (Prohibition of Import) (Revocation) Regulations, 1951, which allowed the importation of parrots was repealed and replaced by the Parrots and Miscellaneous Birds (Prohibition of Importation) Order, 1953, thus avoiding the possibility of introducing infected birds into the country. 3. The supervision of contacts landing from ship or aeroplane called for routine surveillance of 8 persons regarding smallpox and Nil persons regarding typhoid fever. Constant vigilance must be exercised on persons arriving from infected foreign areas and this supervision must be given with discretion and understanding. 17 STATISTICAL APPENDIX C.

ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. The fog which persisted over the Greater London Area from the 5th to the 8th December afforded a very sharp reminder of the dangers of atmospheric pollution and of the economic losses which follow in its train. Deaths in the Greater London Area rose sharply round about this period and is clearly shown by the following figures:— Week ended November 1st 1,511 deaths. Week ended November 8th 1,593 deaths. Week ended November 15th 1,565 deaths. Week end.ed November 22nd 1,699 deaths. Week ended November 29th 1,902 deaths. Week ended December 6th 2,063 deaths. Week ended December 13th 4,703 deaths. Week ended December 20th 3,138 deaths. Week ended December 27th 2,234 deaths. 25 Against the figure of 4,703 deaths for the week ending December 13th the figure for the corresponding week of 1951 was 1,852. New sickness claims under National Insurance for London and Middlesex show a similar rise to a peak figure as also do the applications for hospital beds under the Emergency Bed Service. This increase in applications for hospital beds was mainly due to the increased incidence of respiratory and cardiac disorders. Animal health also suffered during the same period and prize cattle at the Smithfield Show died or had to be slaughtered, and it is significant that those animals which survived made a marked recovery as soon as the fog dispersed. Plant life too, according to the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, was adversely affected. Apart from these direct losses there were the more indirect ones which arose from traffic delays, damage and soiling of business stock and the additional cleansing of premises and furnishings which became necessary. A combination of factors was responsible for the fog. An anticyclonic or high pressure system had established itself over London accompanied by very calm conditions. At the same time there was a temperature inversion—i.e., the comparatively cold air at ground and low levels was overlaid by a belt of warmer air at higher levels, with the result that the smoke and moisture laden air was unable to disperse. Much still remains to be accomplished towards the attainment of cleaner air and the National Smoke Abatement Society, of which the Council are corporate members, has not only been a pioneer in its efforts in this direction but has constantly striven to this end. More and more smokeless sources of heat and power are required, e.g., gas and electricity; more smokeless solid fuels, particularly coke, produced by the low temperature carbonization process which is more easily ignited in existing domestic grates; more efficient appliances for consuming the fuels available. Other requisites include the requirement of prior approval for heating installations in new industrial and commercial buildings; the establishment of more smokeless zones; more widespread training of stokers in the efficient and smokeless firing of boilers and furnaces; the change-over from steam railway locomotives to some other smokeless form of traction. A standard grit deposit gauge was installed in 1952 in order that measurements could be taken in collaboration with the 26 adjoining Borough of Willesden. This gauge is in an industrial area in proximity to a power station and the total solids per month deposited and expressed in tons per square mile were:— March 33.98 August 20.41 April 20.32 September 21.73 May 26.34 October 21.04 June 21.57 November 38.33 July 13.83 December 23.61 It would have afforded an interesting comparison had it been possible to install an additional gauge in a non-industrial part of the Borough to act as a "control." Considerable efforts have continued to be made in the Borough towards the elimination of smoke from industrial plant. 3. FOOD HYGIENE. Conditions in food premises have continued to improve, due no doubt to a variety of reasons — the constant drive by personal approach and the persuasive powers of the staff of the Public Health Department; the continued activities of the Wembley Clean Food Association; possibly the easing of the position with regard to the issue of building licences; and last, but by no means least, the willingness of the more enlightened traders to effect improvements without pressure from official or other sources. The Council decided to provide official printed notices to those traders willing to exhibit them with regard to dogs in food shops, and the Wembley Clean Food Association decided to provide their members with their own design of similar notices but signed by the Medical Officer of Health with the full approval of the Council. 4. FOOD AND DRUGS (MILK, DAIRIES AND ARTIFICIAL CREAM) ACT, 1950; THE MILK AND DAIRIES REGULATIONS, 1949; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED AND STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1949 and 1950; THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (SPECIFIED AREAS) ORDER, 1951. This legislation was fully operative in the Borough for the whole of 1952 with the result that all milk sold in the area was designated milk, the bulk of it being pasteurised or sterilised. No action was found to be necessary under Regulation 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations (relating to disease communicable to man by consumption of milk). 27 During 1952, 149 licences to sell designated milk were issued by the Council. 5. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There were no slaughterhouses in use during the year, although one renewal of licence was granted. A good deal of publicity has been given to the subject of the slaughter of horses and the matter has been raised on more than one occasion in the House of Commons, but no horse slaughtering on licensed premises has been carried on in Wembley for a great many years nor have any licences for knackers' yards been issued. 6. INDUSTRIAL NUISANCES. The Council have continued to be concerned with problems arising under this heading, particularly from noise and vibration and, although some progress has been made, industry does not remain static and the installation of new tools and plant and the application of new methods bring fresh problems in their train. A ease in point has been the installation of a powerful new air compressor with ancillary plant which, despite great efforts on the part of the owners, continues to give rise to complaints from local residents. Expert advice was obtained by the Company concerned and ameliorative steps taken included the provision of double glazed windows to the building housing the machine, the bricking up of a double doorway, the enclosing of certain plant by a brickwork structure, alterations and improvements to the silencing equipment on the air intake plant, alterations to the electric driving motor to overcome whine. Production requires that this compressor should run for a considerable number of hours at a stretch so that the residents have no respite during the night or at week-ends. As the Ministry of Local Government and Planning had allowed the Company to go ahead with the installation of the plant following an appeal against the local authority's decision, the Council decided to refer the matter to the Ministry, where at the time of the compilation of this report the matter rests. Another type of problem has arisen in a different part of the district where a number of small light engineering factories are in close proximity to residential buildings. There are, however, fundamental differences in these cases in that the factories do not work at night and many of the noises are intermittent or transitory. Many approaches have been made to the factory managements concerned, with some benefit but there was a tendency for some noisy processes to recur, such as metal fettling or grinding in the open air, and the noisy handling of tubular metal in an open air compound. In one case the hardening process of metal gave rise to complaints of fumes and noise and the Company decided to abandon this process after representations had 28 been made to them. Other ameliorative measures effected include:—the reduction in working pressure of an air compressor, the elimination of fumes from a gas heated degreasing tank, the provision of rubber tyred wheels to a metal trolley, the lagging of a cyclone extraction plant to reduce noise. The foregoing observations are in no way intended to be exhaustive as details have been set out in previous reports but they are indicative of the problems to be faced. Generally speaking, factory managements are prepared to meet the situation provided remedies can be applied at reasonable cost, which is as far as the law administered by the local authority goes, but experience has shown that even with the best expert advice it has not always been possible to obtain the desired results. 7. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough, which is provided by the Colne Valley Water Co., except for a small area in the southern end of the district supplied by the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., remained satisfactory in quality and quantity. The supply is pumped from deep wells in the chalk outside the Borough boundaries. All of the samples taken from piped supplies were reported as satisfactory. No tendency to plumbo solvent action has been detected. All dwelling houses in the Borough are provided with a mains water supply. There are a number of private wells in the Borough all in connection with industrial undertakings, but in no instance is the water from these sources used for drinking. 8. SWIMMING POOLS. I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the following observations concerning the Corporation's outdoor Swimming Pools:— "As a result of recommendations by the Medical Officer of Health the Council installed "breakpoint" or superchlorination equipment in the Vale Farm and Kingsbury Swimming Pools immediately prior to the 1951 season. After two seasons of practical experience in operation of this "breakpoint" system of chlorination, it is possible to-report excellent results. It is now possible to maintain sparkling clear water, bacteriologically satisfactory at all times, even during times of high bathing load. "As a result of the new system of chlorination the two Swimming Pools in the Borough have been brought into line with the latest developments in public health practice and control, and the risk of contracting infection at the Pools is negligible." 29 The attendances at the Pools during the year were:— Kingsbury 131,779 Vale Farm, Wembley 114,925 9. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. No new developments have taken place in connection with sewerage during the year, but the Council are anxious to proceed with relief works for overcoming flooding from sewers which periodically occurs in times of heavy rainfall and have submitted schemes to the appropriate Ministry for approval, which it is hoped will be forthcoming, The carrying out of these schemes at an early date would afford great solace to those long-suffering residents who have frequently experienced the unpleasant effects of flooding, and would indirectly lead to some improvement of the condition of the River Brent. Some local authorities have experienced great anxiety concerning inadequacy of their sewage disposal works, but Wembley with its neighbours must be regarded as fortunate in that the sewage from the Borough and adjoining areas is received into the West Middlesex trunk sewers and thence conveyed to the modern purification works at Mogden. This provision in Middlesex overcame the necessity for discharging large volumes of sewage works effluents into the River Brent. One cesspool receiving the drainage from a church hall has been abolished, the drains having been connected to the main drainage scheme. This leaves three cesspools in the district, all of which receive drainage from sports pavilions. All dwellinghouses are provided with water closets connected to the Council's sewers. 10. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The contours of the district are such that the whole of the "run off" of surface water ultimately finds its way into the River Brent which flows roughly from north-east to south-west on the easterly side of the Borough and which for a considerable distance forms the boundary with the adjoining Borough of Willesden. There are a number of streams in the Borough which form tributaries to the Brent, the principal one being the Wealdstone Brook which commences in the adjoining district of Harrow. The Welsh Harp Reservoir also feeds the River Brent, and the Reservoir in turn is fed by streams higher up in Hendon and other districts. At its lower end the Brent enters the Borough of Ealing. Following the passing of the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1951, more intensive efforts have been made not only by the Middlesex County Council who are the Rivers Authority under the 30 Act but also by the district authorities concerned, to improve the condition of the River Brent, for the Act places certain responsibilities upon local authorities in connection with pollution arising from the discharge of sewers. Needless to say the only sewers in the Borough discharging direct to rivers are surface water sewers. A conference of officers of local authorities whose districts drain into the River Brent was called by the Ealing Corporation in 1952 with the object of concerted efforts being made by the various authorities concerned to bring about improved conditions in the river. Already some improvement has been noted and on occasions small fish have been observed, but the chances are that they have been fortuitously introduced with possibly a short period of survival, One of the greatest causes of pollution is oil and it is difficult to see how this can be overcome when it is remembered that road washings contain a considerable quantity of oil and a little oil is capable of spreading over a large area of water. If the first flush of storm water from roads and paved areas which would contain most of the oil and detritus could be diverted to the soil sewers this would partly overcome the problem. In several instances quite heavy oil pollution had been traced to its source and in one ease fuel oil storage tanks were found to be leaking. Another source was found to be an oil interceptor which was in need of cleaning out. It is surprising the amount of solid refuse which has to be removed from the river bed; much of it in the nature of tin cans, brick-bats, parts of old bicycles and perambulators, etc., is probably wilfully thrown in, whilst some falls in from deposits of industrial waste which have been placed too near the river banks. Sewage Works effluents virtually ceased to be discharged into the river from the time that the North-West Middlesex Main Drainage Scheme came into operation, with the result that pollution from these sources does not arise. From time to time, however, wrong drainage connections from individual private premises are found and prompt steps are taken to effect a remedy. These sources of pollution are often difficult to trace, for what may be significant pollution during a period of drought becomes almost undetectable when the surface water sewer is carrying its normal flow. The County Council have instituted systematic sampling of the river water at fixed points at monthly intervals and two points have been selected in the Borough, one near where the River Brent enters and the other near where it leaves the Borough. The results of chemical examination by the County 31 Chemist are sent to each local authority concerned and so far the reports of samples taken in Wembley have been generally satisfactory. Much work, however, still remains to be done to effect the desired improvement of the condition of the local river and streams but it is doubtful whether it will ever reach such a condition as to be able to support fish life; at any rate not for some years to come. 11. RODENT CONTROL. The Rodent Control Service, for which a 50% grant is obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, continued to operate, the service being confined to dealing with infestation by rats and mice. A staff of three "Ministry trained" assistants remains the same as in the previous year. No charge is made to householders in respect of treatment at private dwelling houses but in all other cases a charge is made on a time and materials basis. In spite of the comparative nearness of the Borough to the Port of London no ship rats (Rattus rattus) have been found in Wembley. 696 premises were found to be infested by rats or mice and 728 premises were treated; the reason for the apparent discrepancy in these figures being that a number of premises found to be infested late in the previous year were treated in 1952. It has been possible during the year to give an extended trial in the use of Warfarin for dealing with both rats and mice. Warfarin, which is a blood anti-coagulant and does not act as a poison in the ordinary sense, is mixed in minute doses with medium oatmeal and used as a rat and mice bait; mice, incidentally, requiring a stronger dose than brown or common rats. Its properties are cumulative in effect in contra-distinetion to the usual rat poisons which are lethal following the ingestion of one adequate dose. One dose of Warfarin bait will not prove fatal and it is necessary that rodents should be fed over a period before its lethal properties become effective. These properties might at first sight appear to be disadvantageous but there are a number of advantages which accrue from its use. There is no prejudice on the part of animals who have once tasted the bait as can often arise in the case of other poison baits where animals have had a sub-lethal dose. They will continue to feed on Warfarin baits until they prove fatal and there is apparently no pain. Baiting with Warfarin can be commenced at any time without the customary pre-baiting and the baits do not show the same tendency to go mouldy as with other baits. With the older baiting methods poison is only put down on one day of the week and the residue removed the next day so that the chances of rodents missing a fatal dose are greater. Warfarin baits also provide 32 less risk to other domestic animals. The use of Warfarin in this Borough has proved very satisfactory. Other experiments, not conducted in Wembley, however, appear to indicate that Warfarin can be added to tracing dusts which are fairly heavily sprinkled in the run-ways and approaches to rat holes in buildings, with the idea in mind that rodents will contaminate their fur and feet and tails, and that during subsequent cleaning they will ingest sufficient Warfarin in time to prove lethal to them. This method might well prove beneficial in cases where there is an alternative food supply and there is a reluctance on the part of rats to feed on prepared baits. The following statistics relating to the treatment of sewers have been provided by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In February/March, 1952, a 10% test bait of sewer manholes was carried out. 355 manholes were baited and there were 9 partial takes and 8 complete takes. In the treatment which followed 381 manholes were baited when there were 126 partial takes and 21 complete takes. The corresponding figures for the 13th Maintenance Treatment carried out in August, 1952, were:—manholes baited 252, partial takes 60; complete takes 7. 33 STATISTICAL APPENDIX D.

ADMINISTRATION, STAFF. During the year your medical officers have acted professionally for the Council, performing 65 clinical medical examinations of actual or potential staff and have provided a number of special reports to the various Committees of the Council. This activity helps in the provision of a medically sound personnel for all activities of the Council and enables special consideration to be given to any unusual case of sickness, thereby maintaining a standard of efficiency impossible without such a service. I am proud to record the loyalty and diligence displayed in the routine work of the office, and I take this opportunity of thanking the whole staff for another year of conscientious effort. I would conclude by an expression of appreciation to all members of the Council, especially those who serve on the Highways, Works and Public Health Committee and particularly the Chairman, for the admirable way in which they have directed the policy of the Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Mr, Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, E. GRUNDY, Medical Officer of Health. 46 Hendon Printing Works Ltd., 42/44, Victoria Road, N.W.4 'Phone : HEN. 1004
