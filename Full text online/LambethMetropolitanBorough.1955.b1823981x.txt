1 Borough of Lambeth PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (appointed by the Council on the 27th May, 1955). * * * The Worshipful the Mayor of Lambeth (Councillor N. Marock, J.P.) ( ex-officio) Aldermen: A. E. COTTON Chairman C. S. JORDAN W. LAVERICK Mrs A. LOCKYER Councillors: W. DRISCOLL C. GOLDBAUM H. G. HALL Miss E. M. HICKMAN F. KINGS Mrs. M. MAROCK J. P. PLUM T. ROBINSON Vice-Chairman 3 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the 99th Annual Report on the health of the Borough. Dr. A. G. G. Thompson Medical Officer of Health since 1927 retired on 22nd September and for the remainder of the period under review the department was under the supervision of Dr. W. Stott, Medical Officer of Health of Southwark. For this reason the contents of the report are mainly statistical, dealing with the work over a period of which I have no first hand knowledge. The health of the Borough has remained good. The population as estimated by the Registrar General has decreased by 2,000 during the year. The birth rate is fractionally less than in 1954 whereas the death rate is slightly higher, both figures being less than for London and England and wales. Infant mortality which is often regarded as an index of the social and environmental conditions of a community is lower than last year and is also below that for London and the country as a whole. The care and welfare of the aged are matters which continue to engage the attention of the Public Health Department and will continue to do so for years to come. The officers have maintained close contact with all the agencies, both statutory and voluntary which can assist in alleviating and brightening the lot of those in the eventide of their lives. In the body of the report will be found a brief account of the activities of the Lambeth Old Peoples Welfare Association an organisation in which the Council is actively interested and to which it gives financial support. Finally, I must refer to the council's Scheme for Holidays for the Elderly which has given so much pleasure to those able to participate in it. At the end of the year the inspectorial staff was two short of the establishment of nineteen. Replacement is difficult as the number of students presenting themselves for training as Sanitary Inspectors in the country as a whole falls short of requirements. Theclerical staff was also two below establishment In conclusion, although I was not your Medical Officer during 1955, which is the period covered by the report, I would like to express my thanks to the Council and especially the Public Health Committee for the welcome they have accorded me. 4 I am grateful also to Dr. Stott and Dr. Moss for their help when I took office and to the Chief Officers of the Council. Finally I wish to thank the inspectorial and clerical staff for their assistance to me since I came to Lambeth and in the preparation of this report. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F Saiman Medical Officer of Health August 1956. 5 STAFF of the PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT DURING the YEAR ENDING 31st DECEMBER, 1955.

The natural increase by births over deaths was 1, 212. The following table shows the actual numbers and the percentages of deaths in various age groups from which it will be observed that 66.83% of all deaths occurred among those aged 65 years and older. Much is being done to help these elderly people from becoming a burden upon others as well as often a burden to themselves. A local authority has, at present, no power to provide services for the aged. It can only financially assist voluntary organisations who carry out the work. Infantile mortality has been reduced by a better knowledge of the nursing and feeding requirements of mothers and babies but the problem with the elderlj is not the same. Children eat what they are given and their day works to a time table. Adults eat and drink what they choose and as much or little as they want or can obtain. They suit their day and mode of life to their own time table with the result that most elderly people suffer later on for their lack of care for themselves in the past.

(19.36), and influenza, bronchitis and pneumoni a, three causes of death largely dependent upon the weather, were the cause of 3 55 ( 290) deaths or 14.88 ( 12.62) per cent. During the year the number of live births corrected by inward or outward transfers was 3. 597. giving a corrected birth rate of 16.04 compared with 16.29 in 1954, a decrease of 0,25 per 1,000 population. Deaths from tuberculosis of the lungs continue to fall with betta knowledge of treatment. The number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis in 1948, seven years ago was 135 and new cases 369; the corresponding numbers for 1955 were 36 and 253 new cases It is often forgotten that it is infectious and that overcrowding due to inadequate housing is a potent cause of spread. 9 The following table gives a comparison of tuberculosis of the lung and of cancer of the lung as causes of death over the past five years:- Age Groups Respiratory Tuberculosis Neoplasms of the Lung or 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1951 Bronchus 1955 1952 1953 1954 Males - 0 - 1 1 - 1 5 - - 15 - - - - - 1 - - - - - 25 - 26 13 5 3 5 5 2 4 4 3 45 - 37 20 18 10 10 55 49 39 51 59 65 - 10 10 9 10 7 29 21 22 27 21 75 - 3 1 4 1 3 8 3 8 10 10 TOTAL MALES 76 44 38 24 26 97 75 73 92 93 Femal es - 0 - 1 1 - - 5 - - 15 - 1 2 1 - - - - - - - 25 - 9 4 3 3 3 2 2 3 4 - 45 - 5 8 - 4 2 8 11 6 11 9 65 - 4 - 3 3 - 2 7 9 6 6 75 - 1 2 - - 1 6 6 5 1 5 TOTAL FEMALES 20 16 8 10 6 18 26 23 22 20 MATERNAL MORTALITY The maternal mortality is expressed as the number of deaths attributed to puerperal and post-abortive sepsis and other maternal causes for each 1,000 births.

This body receives financial assistance from the Council and carries out welfare activities which the Counci 1 are unable to do directly. The following details of the work of the Association have been obtained from their latest report and apply to the year ending 31st March, 1956. MEALS ON WHEELS This service provides old people with a meal daily during the week at 10d per meal. The balance of the cost is borne by the London County Council. The delivery of meals is undertaken in North Lambeth by the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association who provide the staff and transport. During the year they delivered 8,033 meals. In South Lambeth the W. V. S. undertakes the distribution of the meals and they delivered 9,490 during the year. CHIROPODY There are five clinics giving 11 sessions per week. At the beginning of the year there were only two. The clinics are working to capacity and at the end of the year over 1,000 individuals were receiving treatment. OLD PEOPLES CLUBS There are 26 old people's clubs open in the borough. HOLIDAYS FOR THE ELDERLY In 1955 the Council sponsored a pilot scheme to provide a week's holiday at the seaside for pensioners resident in the borough who had not had a holiday for three years. The administration of the project was undertaken by the Public Health Department. The applicant contributed £1. towards the cost of a week's holiday at Brighton. in addition to the week's board and lodging tickets were given for an outing, a cinema show, a concert and the pier. During the period 24th September to 8th October, 200.pensioners from Lambeth enjoyed a holiday by the sea under this scheme and •many appreciative letters have since been received from them In view of the success of this venture the Council decided to continue and expand the project in 1956. It is hoped to include a fuller report on this matter in next year's annual report. 14 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Sanitary Inspectors. Total number of inspections 10,0 22 Total number of reinspections 14.892 Total number of intimation notices served 2,091 Total number of statutory notices served 1, 149 Women Sanitary Inspectors Total number of visits and inspections (factories workplaces, infectious disease, etc) 2,055 Total number of intimation notices served 54 Total number of statutory notices served 1 Total number of revisits 418 Restaurants in which defects were found 44 Old and Infirm persons living in insanitary conditions 135 The cost of repairs particularly to old property remains a serious problem both for owners and for the Council who themselves carry out the necessary work when a Court Order is ignored, collecting rents to recoup themselves and registering a charge upon the property. At the end of the year there were 101 cases outstanding from which some £6,721 was owing while in 25 others the estimated cost of works approved but not completed was £2, 250. The opportunity given to owners of property of obtaining higher rent under the Housing Repai rs and Rents Act, 1954 did not, as was envisaged, result in large numbers of applications for Certificates of Disrepair and there were also remarkably few applications for grants obtainable under the Housing Act, 1949. SCABIES AND VERMINOUS PERSONS Cleansing Centre. A total of 254 persons were treated at the cleansing station and given 357 treatments, compared with 323 persons treated in the previous year. The number of cases of scabies notified, 30 , compares with 48 in 1954, 30 in 1953, 36 in 1952, 43 in 1951. 40 in 1950.68 in 1949, 125 in 1948, 310 in 1947. 758 in 1946 and 851 in 1945. Wore settled conditions of life and moderntreatments have both conduced to this end. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS 1948 and 1951 Section 47. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and protection. In only one case was it necessary to apply for an order for the compulsory removal of an aged person to an institution. 15 Section 50. Burial or Cremation of the Dead Arrangements were made during the year for the burial of 29 cases, of whom 21 were males. 8 were females. All were Lambeth cases. The net cost to the Council was £191. 11. 8d. THE PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS During the year 1955, 954 complaints have been investigated. Of these. 733 were found to be brown (common) rats. 3 black (ship) rats, 153 mice, and 65 were found to be not justified: 1. 035 bai tings were carried out and in 128 cases defective or disused drains were found to be the cause of infestations and were dealt with by the Borough Engineer and the Sanitary Inspectors. No major infestations have come to light during theyear. In no case has the infestation been of a serious character. Inspections 1, 226 Revisits 1, 284 Notices served 8 Sewer treatment with poison was carried out by the Borough Engineer's department during the year in conjunction with the Rodent Officer and his staff. There were many complaints during the year of insect infestations which were effectively combatted. The usual offenders were wood boring beetles, psocids, ants, cockroaches, drug store beetles, carpet beetles, clothes moths, weevils, clover mites and silverfish. REHOUSING AND OVERCROWDING 2178 cases have been investigated with the following results: - LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL Cases Overcrowding 6 1 Illness 277 Insanitary conditions 705 LAMBETH BOROUGH COUNCIL Health (Medical Certifiactes) 628 Insanitary conditions 217 Inquiries from other Authorities 72 During this period the L.

Since its inception there have been 383 applications for membership of which 36 were not proceeded with or withdrawn for one reason or another. 294 have been approved and accepted and 377 certificates (one for each shop) have been issued. Of these 81 have been surrendered as the premises have changed hands but 39 of the newcomers have been accepted for membership and are included in the 294 mentioned above. The number of badges issued is 853, these being worn by those serving the public whether members or employees of members. Qualification for membership consists of two principal requirements, first that the premises shall comply with the statutory requirements and bylaws and second that the applicant and employees agree to maintain scrupulous cleanliness of person, of clothing and of untensils. The first insures that the facilities for cleanliness are available for use and the second that they shall be properly and efficiently used. 20 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION During the year a station was set up at the Town Hall for the dally measurement and recording of the concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere by the combined filter and volumetric method. After titration in respect of the sulphur dioxide and comparison of the smoke stained filter with the standard scale of shades the concentrations are calculated by formulæ In addition, at the Metropolitan Water Board. Brixton Hill, observations are made of the rainfall and deposited matter by means of the deposit gauge and measurements of sulphur dioxide with the lead-peroxide instrument. This station has been in operation since 195-3. During the year 54 complaints were received of nuisance from smoke from factory shafts which were satisfactorily handled without recourse to more than the intimation notice and by word of mouth, with the exception of one case where a statutory notice had to be served. OFFENSIVE TRADES Establishment Orders have been granted to two companies who carry on the offensive trades respectively of (a) fellmonger and (b) fatboiler. (a) Messrs Gaston Morrell, Ferndale Road (b) Messrs. Lepard, Wandsworth Road. These two orders are renewable annually.

The water supply for the area is provided almost entirely by the Metropolitan Water Board, but there are a few deep wells of which some supply water for purposes other than human consumption while in a few cases the supply is used for potable purposes both for drinking on the premises as well as for the manufacture of beverages and for similar trade purposes In these latter cases a comprehensive examination of the supply both bacteriological as well as chemical is made every three months at least which is deemed sufficient for ample warning of any serious changes to be observed before there is danger to health. PREVALENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The mortality from Infectious disease was again almost negligible; scarlet fever 0, diphtheria 0, measles 1, and whooping cough 0. Although immunisation against whooping cough is by no means certain, even with the best prophylactics now in use, because it is at present a more dangerous disease than diphtheria it is no doubt expedient to satisfy the demand for immunisation against both diseases. If not there is a possibility that immunisation against diphtheria may be less diligently sought. Poliomyeli tis 31 confirmed notifications were received, of which 19 were paralytic, the rate per 1,000 population being 0.14 there were three deaths the rate per 1,000 population being 0.01. In no Instance was it possible to trace any contact with another case Food Poisoning Of the 82 cases notified during the year there were eleven houses In which more than one case occurred. On the 10th May 1955, cases of illness attributed to food poisoning occurred at a School in the borough. It was found that 30 13 persons (7 staff, three canteen helpers and three pupils) had suffered from diarrhoea during the night 10/llth May None of the persons affected received medical attention and all were better by the next morning. All had eaten the school dinner on the day before, as indeed had 250 other people. Asample dinner consisting of roast veal, vegetables, stewed apricots and custard had been set aside and saved and this meal was submitted for examination to the Public Health Laboratory Service, A report was subseouently received that a small number of Staphylococcus Aureus had been isolated on the roast veal. None of the food handlers appeared to be suffering from any condition which might lead to this kind of Infection. The outbreak was a minor one and apart from the fact that a measure of distress was suffered by a small number of people it was not of great importance. It cannot be over-stressed, however, that if all who handled the food had exercised scrupulous personal cleanliness the outbreak would not have occurred. 31 Tuberculosis Notifications received during the year ended 31st December, 1955 Respiratory 232 (352) Non-respiratory 21 (17) Deaths certified 36 (41) The notifications per 1,000 population for thepast ten years (1946-55) have been 1.16, 1.68, 1.63. 2.01, 1.87. 1.86, 1.55, 1.52, 1.63. 1.13. 16,075 persons were x-rayed during the visit of the Mass X Ray unit to the Town Hall (September-December).

D.D.T with Pyrethrum as a 'Knockout'. It was necessary to treat 39 houses a second time.
