MERO 29 Merton & Morden Urban District Council. REPORT of MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH on the Sanitary Conditions and Vital Statistics, and Report of Sanitary Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1920. Submitted to the Council, 24th June, 1921. J. B. Blackmore & Co., Ltd., 85, High Street, Merton, S.W. 19. Merton & Morden Urban District Council. HEALTH REPORT FOR 1920. TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE MERTON AND MORDEN URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting my Annual Report for the year 1920, being the thirteenth since Merton became an Urban District and the eighth since its amalgamation with Morden. The birth-rate for the combined District was 19.8 per 1,000 of estimated population, as compared with 25.4 per 1,000 for England and Wales. The birth-rate in 1919 was 14.2, and in 1918 was 14 per 1,000 of estimated population The standardised death-rate was 9.4 per 1,000 of estimated population, as against 12.4 per 1,000 for England and Wales. The death-rate in 1919 was 12.1, and in 1918 was 13 per 1,000 of estimated population. The infant mortality rate was 72.4 per 1,000 of registered births, as compared with 80 per 1,000 registered births for England and Wales. In 1919 the figure was 50.5, and in 1918 was 95.4. I desire to express my hearty thanks to the Council and their Officers for the help and consideration they have shown me. I should like also to place on record my appreciation of the able assistance rendered by Mr. Pointon and all members of the Public Health Staff. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. N.

H. marshall, c.m.B. Clerk A. V. B. ALLEN. Report. NATURAL & SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE DISTRICT. At the 1911 Census the population for District amounted to 14,140. My estimate for the middle of 1920 is 18,200. The District is somewhat flat, having a slight rise towards the Southern or Morden aspect. In the Northern or Merton portion of the District the sub-soil merges into the underlying clay in the East, West, and in the whole of the Morden portion. The area is about 8,237 acres, only a portion of which is built upon. The surface is drained by the River Wandle, and the Pyl and Beverly Brooks. The population is mainly composed of the better type of the working classes, and there is no particular occupation which can influence public health. The Clerk to the- Croydon Union Guaidians, Mr. Walker, has supplied me with following figures relating to Poor LawRelief:— Men. Women. Children Total.

Rivers and Streams are under the supervision of your Inspector of Nuisances. 5 Drainage and Sewerage. — The Wandle Valley Joint Sewerage Board are about to commence large extension works in order to meet the present requirements of the Combined Districts served by it. Closet Accomodation.—With few exceptions the whole of the District is provided with Water Closets. Scavenging.—The Scavenging of the District is carried out under the direction of your Surveyor. There is a weekly collection of house refuse, which is disposed of at the Refuse Shoot, Morden. Schools.—There are five Schools in the District, of which three are comparatively new buildings. The routine medical inspection of children is cai'ried out by the Surrey County Council. Returns are periodically made by the School Teachers of the District as to the prevalence of infectious diseases ; and, as occasions arise, the Schools are visited and the Head Teachers informed of the cases that are to be excluded on account of disease, either of the children themselves or at their homes, and notification is again sent when the children are to return to school. The Abbey Road Schools were closed on the 20th and 21st May on account of the prevalence of measles. The Infants' Department of the Merton Schools was closed from the 23rd to 31st March on account of the prevalence of measles. Class 2 of the Raynes Park School was closed on the 26th July on account of the prevalence of scarlet fever. 6 Sanitary Inspection of the District.—The Report of your Inspector of Nuisances is appended. FOOD. Milk supply.—The farms and dairies in the District are frequently inspected. Milk.—Bye-laws are in force under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Attention is paid to the lighting, ventilation, cleanliness, drainage and water supply, so as to ensure as far as possible the proper health of the cows, and the prevention of milk from contamination. Samples of milk have been taken for the purpose of the detection of pus and dirt, but no action has been required. HOUSING. General Housing Conditions in the District.—The total number of houses in the District at the end of the year under review was 3,917, of which approximately 3,000 are inhabited by the working classes. The present population is estimated as being 18,000, which will probably increase during the year. There is still an acute shortage of houses in the District. Fitness op Houses.—Generally speaking the standard of houses in the District is fair. Unhealthy Areas.—I am not prepared to say, definitely, that there are any areas within the District which are so insanitary or unhealthy as to render the houses within such areas unfit for habitatiton, but there are one or two localities where, perhaps, the condition of some of the dwelling-houses— owing to extreme age—falls below a reasonable standard. 7  No. of houses occupied to March, 1921.

Diptheria.—Forty-seven cases were reported with three deaths, which equals an incidence rate of 2.5 per 1,000 of estimated population, and a death-rate of .1 per 1,000 of population. The monthly incidence was as follows;—12 in January, 9 in February, 5 in March, 3 in April, 2 in May, 6 in June, 2 in July, 2 in August, 1 in September, 1 in October, 1 in November, and 3 in December. Of the 47 cases notified 4 2 were removed to hospital and 5 were treated Ht home. The figures for the previous years are as follows:— 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 24 25 24 19 17 57 26 Scarlet Fever.—Sixty-five cases were notified, which equals an incidence rate of 3.5 per 1,000 of estimated population. Apparently, the infection was of a mild type as no deaths were registered. The figures for the previous years are as follows:— 1913 1914 1915 1916 1917 1918 1919 25 56 59 20 12 5 20 8 Enteric Fever.—One case was reported. MEASLES.—This is no longer a notifiable disease in this District. TUBERCULOSIS.—The Surrey County Council are responsible for the treatment of cases in this District. All notified cases are, however, visited and the patients are instructed in the methods of the disinfection of sputum, and opportunity is taken of inspecting the premises. Particular note is made of the sleeping accomodation in the house. The rooms are disinfected at the termination of a case.

Roughly speaking families whose weekly average incomes have been less than 6s. per head, after deducting the rental, have been supplied with varying amounts (according to the nature of the case) of free milk. When the average has been 6s., families have had to pay an amount proportionate to their means, and with few exceptions no families have been supplied with milk at a reduced price where the average income per week exceeded 10s. per head. All applications are now considered by a special Milk SubCommittee which meets once a month to deal with fresh applications and to review all existing cases with a view to recommending their continuation, alteration or withdrawal. There are two Infant Consultation centres situated in the two extreme ends of the District, one being held at the Iron Room, St. Saviour's Church, Grand Drive, Raynes Park, and the other at the Mission Hall, Pincott Road, Merton. These meetings are held on alternate weeks. During the year there has been an average attendance of 33 per week. 10 This important branch of Public Health Work is continually increasing, and the results already achieved are most gratifying, not only in this District only, but over the whole country. The steady fall in the Infant Mortality Rate is a most satisfactory feature, and almost entirely due to the interest and care that have of late years been focussed on the saving of Infant life. This work, which belongs largely to the realm of preventive medicine is the more valuable in that it tends to enable the infant to develop into a healthy child, and to avoid the appearance of the hopeless cripple and the type of child that is too often a charge to the community for the rest of his or her life. A certain number of expectant mothers have attended at the Centres, and in order to meet their requirements in future plans aie being made to open an Ante-Natal Centre, which will be conducted by the Medical Officer of Health, assisted by the Health Visitor, and one or more other nurses as required. I should like to place on record my high appreciation of the very valuable services of the Voluntary Workers who have helped so loyally and skilfully at the Child Welfare Centres. It is entirely owing to their co-operation and enthusiasm that it has been found possible to get through the amount of work that has been done. Towards the end of the year arrangements have been made to supply those attending the Centres with preparations such as Codliver oil and malt and a few simple medicines at cost price, reduced price, or free, according to the circumstances. This appears to have met a long-felt want. 11 Infant Mortality for the year under review was 72.4 per 1,000 net births. There has been an increase in the number of infant deaths for the year 1920, but this is almost entirely accounted for by the number of premature births which have been registered. Epidemic Diarrhcea.— There were no deaths from Epidemic Diarrhoea Puerperal Fever.— One case was notified. Ophthalmia. Neonatorum.—Two cases were notified. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. The Wandle Valley Joint Hospital, which is situated at Beddington Corner, Mitcham Junction, is the Joint Hospital for the four Urban Districts of Beddington and Wallington, Coulsdon and Purley, Merton and Morden, and Mitcham. The Hospital was opened for the reception of patients at the beginning of March, 1899, and since that date 7,163 patients have been admitted. During the year 1920 651 patients have been admitted, as against 433 in 1919, 357 in 1918, 213 in 1917, 295 in 1916, and 444 in 1915. Of the 651 patients admitted in the year 1920, 24 died and 627 were discharged as cured. The case mortality from all causes was 3.7 per cent. Disease. Deaths. Case Mortality.

Mr. Chairman and gentlemen,— I have the honour to present my Report for the work carried out for 1920. Much of the subject of this Report has already been reported upon at the monthly Committee Meetings, but this will give a more comprehensive record than it would be possible to obtain otherwise. Systematic inspection of dwelling houses has been carried out at 215 houses in the following streets—Edna Road, Gore Road, and Aston Road. There were 120 complaints received and investigated. 593 Preliminary Notices have been served. It was found necessary to serve 61 Statutory Notices. In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. The Table at the end of the Report shows in detail the improvements effected and the nuisances abated. As a result of applications of smoke and water tests it became necessary to obtain the authority of the Council for the purpose of examining the drains in respect of 9 houses. This authority was only exercised in 4 cases, as the respective owners took action upon the service of the Preliminary Notices. 19 Drains re-constructed, 10. Drains repaired, 42. The surfaces of the yards of 68 houses have been paved with impervious material where previously they were merely earth or clinker. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS. There were 5 cowsheds registered in the District, three of which are situated in Morden and 2 in Merton. In these cowsheds milk is produced and delivered to retailers in this and surrounding districts. Special attention has been given to these premises and all have been limewashed and cleansed. There are 15 premises at which milk is offered for sale, 6 being small general shops, and in the latter constant attention is necessary in order to secure the cleanliness of the premises and utensils for the sale of the milk. Visits paid to these premises, 125. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There are 6 slaughterhouses in the District; 2 "licensed" at Garth Road, Morden, and 4 "registered" at Merton. There is a fair amount of killing carried on, the animals concerned being chiefly pigs and sheep. It is my practice to endeavour to make an inspection at the time of slaughter. Attention is also directed to butcher-shops and fishmongers where food is prepared or exposed for sale. In all' 499 visits have been made at irregular periods in order to ensure that the food is fit for human consumption. There are 8 bakehouses, 2 at Morden and 6 at Merton, all of which are above ground level There have been 20 frequent inspections of the premises, and they have been limewashed or cleansed, as required by the Statute, at regular intervals. Total visits, 103. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. All premises registered under the Factories and Workshops Act have been visited and inspected, attention being directed to the following points:—Provision of ventilation, sanitary accommodation, and air-space. There ar e 11 factories and 18 workshops and workplaces, to which 235 visits of inspection were made. Seventeen workshops were cleansed by request. 1 -INSPECTION OF FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. Premises. Number of Inspections.

During the year 70 samples were taken for analysis, 53 of which were formal and 17 informal. The whole of the formal samples were found to be genuine, while 4 of the informal were adulterated. PETROLEUM ACTS. At the close of the year there were 10 premises in respect of which licences to store petroleum had been issued. Two were in respect of store depots owned by companies holding large stocks, 5 for motor garages, 2 for retail oilshops, and 1 in respect of a varnish works. 39 samples of paraffin were tested and proved to be of good quality and above the flash-point. 23 In conclusion 1 have to record ray appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. A. Tucker, Assistant Inspector, and by Mr. V. Allen, the Clerk to the department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. B. POINTON, Sanitary Inspector. 24 SUMMARY.
