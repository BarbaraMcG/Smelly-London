To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the district for the year 1901. The statistics of births, deaths and infectious diseases, relate to the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1901. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April Gth, 1901, was 137,289, showing an increase of 23,508 compared with the enumerated total in 1896, the increase being greater than in any metropolitan borough excepting Wandsworth. The following table shows the increase of the population of the borough during the last 50 years. TABLE I. Year. Population. Increase per cent. During Previous Intercensal Period.

The females enumerated in Fulham exceed the males by 7,985, there being 112.4 females for every 100 males, which compares with 113.9 for every 100 at the Census of 1891, and 111.3 for every 100 at that of 1896. In the County of London there are 111.8 females for every 100 males. The variation in the proportion of males to females in the several Wards of the Borough will be seen in the following table:— TABLE IV. PROPORTION OF MALES TO FEMALES. Ward.

Natural Increase of the Population. During the intercensal period of 5 years there were 21,579 births in Fulham and 11,075 deaths of residents in the borough, or an excess of registered births over deaths of 10,504, the gain by migration during the same period being 13,004. During the previous intercensal period of 5 years, 1891 — 1896, the excess of births over deaths was 8,503 and the gain by migration 13,638. Social Condition of the Inhabitants. As at the census of 1891, each head of family or separate occupier living in less than five rooms was asked to state the number of rooms occupied, and the subjoined table gives the number of these tenements:— TABLE VII. Tenements of less than five rooms in the Borough of Fulham, distinguishing those occupied by various numbers of persons. Rooms in tenement. Tenements of less than 5 rooms.

In the County of London of every 100 families or separate occupiers, 66 occupy tenements of fewer than 5 rooms, the proportion in the several boroughs ranging from 30 per cent. in Lewisham and 42 per cent. in Wandsworth and Hampstead to 84 per cent. in Betlmal Green and 85 per cent. in Finsbury and Shoreditch. It is, however, satisfactory to note that although the proportion of the population living in tenements of less than five rooms in Fulham is higher than in 1891, the chief increase has been in the three and four-roomed tenements and that the number of one-roomed tenements is but slightly higher than in 1891, while the proportion of the population living in them has actually declined, as will be seen from the following tables :— TABLE VIII.

The following table gives the number of overcrowded tenements of each kind in 1891 and 1901, and also the number overcrowded out of every hundred families or separate occupiers in each kind of tenement.

Less than one person to a room 9,305 6.7 4,497 4.9 From the above it will be seen that there is a marked diminution in the worst cases of over-crowding, and that the percentage of the population living under unquestionably over-crowded conditions, i.e., more than two persons to a room, has declined from 14.3 per cent. in 1891 to 11.5 per cent. in 1901, so that taking these figures into consideration, together with the relative decrease of one-roomed tenements, we are entitled to say that the standard of comfort in house accommodation has improved during the last ten years. 13 Comparison of Over-crowding in Fulham and other Metropolitan Boroughs. It may be of interest to learn how Fulham stands with regard to over-crowding as compared with other metropolitan boroughs, and the following table shows the number over-crowded in each borough out of every 100 families or separate occupiers in each kind of tenement.

The most numerous section of the population is that engaged in the conveyance of men, goods and messages, numbering 8,990, while 7,549 are engaged in various branches of the building trade. Domestic indoor servants numbered 5,972, being in the proportion of 18.6 servants to every 100 families or separate occupiers, the corresponding proportions ranging in the metropolitan boroughs from 5.7 per cent. in Shoreditch, 5.8 per cent. in Bethnal Green and 6.6 per cent. in Bermondsey, to 65'8 per cent. in Westminster, 80'0 per cent. in Kensington and 81.4 per cent. in Hampstead. Foreigners in Fulham numbered 1,778 (1,123 males and 625 females). In the afflicted class were 81 blind, 43 deaf and dumb, 85 deaf, 29 lunatics, and 113 imbeciles. Estimated Population in the middle of 1901. The population of Fulham in the middle of 1901 as estimated on the assumption that the rate of increase during 1896-1901 is being continued was 138,426, and on that figure the statistics in this report are based. Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1,137 marriages were solemnized in Fulham during the year compared with 1,095, 1,153 and 1,162 in the three previous years. The marriage-rate, i.e., persons married per 1,000 inhabitants, was 16.4, the rate of the metropolis being 17.6 and that of England and Wales, 15.9. Births and Birth-rate. The births registered during the year numbered 4,596— 2,346 males and 2,250 females. There was one birth to every 30 inhabitants, and 100 births of males to 95.9 of females. 16 These births correspond to a birth-rate of 33.3 per 1,000, being the lowest yet recorded in Fulham. The steady decline in the birth-rate of recent years will be seen on reference to Table XVI. The birth-rate of the County of London was 29.0, being lower than in any preceding year and in the three adjoining boroughs, the rates were—Kensington, 20.4, Hammersmith, 26.8, and Chelsea, 221. In the other metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 13.7 in the City of London, 17.8 in Westminster, and 18.0 in Hampstead to 35.6 in Bethnal Green, 37.2 in Stepney and 37.7 in Finsbury. In the 32 large provincial towns the birth-rate was 29'8, ranging from 22.5 in Halifax, 22 7 in Huddersfield and 231 in Bradford to 35.2 in West Ham, 355 in Sunderland and 36.8 in Gateshead. Distribution of Births. The following Table gives the number of births and the birth-rate in the various wards:— TABLE XV. Ward. No. of Births. Birth Rate Barons Court Ward 192 15.7 Lillie Ward 662 30.5 Walham Ward 375 29.4 Margravine Ward 759 44.9 Munster Ward 1098 38.3 Hurlingham Ward 241 27.0 Sand's End Ward 873 36.2 Town Ward 396 30.0 17 The birth-rate of Margravine Ward is swollen by the births occuring in the Fulham Infirmary, and of these 13.7 were the children of women who did not reside prior to their confinement in the Ward. If these be deducted the birth-rate of that district will be reduced to 37.4 and that of the Borough to 32.3. Illegitimacy. The illegitimate births were 225 in number, 112 males and 113 females, forming 4.9 per cent. of the total births. Of these, however, 43 were of children born in the Fulham Infirmary, whose mothers had not previously resided in Fulham. Deducting all the births of children born in the Infirmary, whose mothers did not belong to the district, the percentage of illegitimates was 4T. Still-born Children. One hundred and sixty-six still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 28 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population of the Borough by the excess of births over deaths was 2,417, compared with 2,139, 2,079, and 2,178 in the three preceding years. The following table prepared in accordance with the instructions of the Local Government Board gives the population of, and the births and deaths occurring in, Fulham in 1901, and the ten preceding years. 18 TABLE XVI.

Sixteen cases of small pox were notified in Fulham during the year. In March a case occurred in Queen's Club Gardens, and it was evident that the husband of the patient had previously suffered from a mild attack of the disease which had been unrecognised, but the source of his infection could not be traced. Subsequent to this there was no case in Fulham until the end of November, when three cases in one family were reported in Seagrave mews. All fell ill together, and a boy, who worked in the same shop in Kensington as one of the patients, was also attacked at the same time, but the common source of infection could not be traced. 30 On November 30th a man, lodging at Rowton House, Hammersmith, where several cases had occurred, on visiting a medical practitioner in Fulham was found to be suffering from small pox, having been ill some four or five days, and it was subsequently ascertained that on the previous day, November 29th, when the rash was abundant, he had been working as a plasterer in Fulham, and the following are known to have been infected by him:— Five women who had been working, on November 29th, at a laundry in Jervis road where he was repairing a floor. A woman residing in Goodson road close to the laundry in Jervis road. A barman at a public-house which he visited. Three fellow-workmen, one of whom lived in Willesden. In one of the latter cases the nature of the illness was unrecognised, and nine other cases have resulted this year. The following table gives particulars of the cases notified in Fulham.

Do. 31 32 1,702 cases of Small-pox wore notified in the County of London in 1901, 14 cases being notified in the first six months of the year, 272 in the third quarter, and 1,416 in the last quarter. The epidemic commenced in August in the Borough of St. Pancras and has since extended all over London and into some of the suburban districts. The disease was most prevalent last year in St. Pancras, 256 cases, Holborn, 216 cases, Stepney, 161 cases, and Bermondsey, 107 cases. With the exception of one patient who was considered by her medical attendant when notified to be too ill to be removed, all the cases were promptly removed to hospital, the usual steps being taken to check the spread of the disease, and three families from infected houses were accommodated in the Council's shelter in Town mead Road, during the disinfection of their rooms. All known contacts residing in the Borough, were, when willing, at once vaccinated, and the only secondary cases resulting from those reported in 1901, were those in which vaccination was neglected. In case 10 in the above list, the patient who was a relative of the three boys removed from Seagrave Mews, had visited them on the day before their removal, but was not vaccinated, while all the inmates of the house, ten in number, and living under overcrowded conditions, who were at once revaccinated, escaped the disease. Two other members of the family of the patient removed from Bayonne Poad (case 13) who refused to be vaccinated also subsequently suffered from the disease. Vaccination. The following tables, furnished by Mr. Davies, the Vaccination Officer, give the Vaccination returns for 1900, and for the first six months of 1901, those for the last six months not being vet comnlete:— TABLE XXIX.

There was an increase of 48 in tlx; number of attacks of scarlet fever notified in 1901, as compared with the previous year, 600 cases being reported as against 552 in 1901. The returns for the four quarters were as under : Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 105 8 2nd „ 195 7 3rd „ 154 8 4th „ 140 2 ft will be noticed that the usual autumnal increase of the disease did not show itself, its maximum prevalence being in the second quarter when it is usually at its minimum. Of the 600 cases, 512 or 85 per cent. were removed to hospital. Fatality.—The disease was generally of a very mild type especially during the latter half of the year, the faiality being the lowest yet recorded in Fulham, there being 20 deaths or 3.3 deaths to every 100 attacks. The following table shows the comparative prevalence of scarlet fever in Fulham, the adjoining boroughs and London during the last 10 years. TABLE XXXII. Number of eases of Scarlet Fever notified per J ,000 of the population. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 18005 1897 1898 1899 1900 Average 10 years, 1891-1900 1901 Fulham 1.3 5.5 6.8 4.9 3.0 5.4 6.3 6.5 6.5 4.1 5.0 4.3 Kensington 1.9 4.3 5.6 2.3 3.1 6.0 4.4 2.8 2.6 2.1 3.5 2.7 Hammersmith 2.3 4.6 6.7 3.2 3.6 5.1 3.7 4.3 4.1 3.2 4.1 3.1 Chelsea Home District ... 2.0 5.0 6.5 3.1 6.6 5.7 4.1 3.5 3.0 2.5 4.2 2.fi 2.7 6.4 8.6 4.3 4.5 5.8 5.1 3.8 4.0 3.0 4.8 4.1 Return Cases. 14 cases occurred within 10 days of the return of a child living in the same house from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, after recovery from a similar attack. 35 Diphtheria. The number of cases of diphtheria notified in 1901, was practically the same as in the preceding year, 636 cases of diphtheria and 8 of membranous croup being reported, compared with 630 of diphtheria and 11 of membranous croup in 1900. The cases occurring in the four quarters of the year, were :— Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 128 13 2nd „ 90 7 3rd „ 163 6 4th ,, 263 22 Fatality.—Although there was no diminution in the number of cases, there was a marked fall in the fatality of the disease, the number of deaths, viz. 48, being actually fewer than in any year since 1892, the case mortality, viz. 7'5 per cent. being the lowest yet recorded. The decline in the fatality of this disease in recent years, which is mainly due to the use of anti-toxic serum, will be seen from the following table:— TABLE XXXIII. Fatality of Diphtheria in Fulham. Year. Number of Cases. Number of Deaths. Deaths per 100 cases. 1891 82 31 37.8 1892 111 30 27.0 1893 250 65 26.1 1894 342 108 31.6 1895 386 77 20.0 1896 355 78 22.0 1897 388 62 16.3 1898 476 61 12.8 1899 528 59 11.2 1900 641 65 10.2 1901 644 48 7.5 36 528 or 82 per cent. of the cases notified in Fulham were removed to hospital, and of these 37 or 7.0 per cent. died, the fatality of the cases treated at home being 9.5 per cent.

In London there was a slight increase in the prevalence of diphtheria in 1901, 12,154 cases being notified, against 11,994 in 1900. The disease again showed a higher proportional prevalence in Fulham than in any other borough, but the fatality was but little above that of the County of London, and was exceeded in six boroughs. 37 The comparative prevalence and fatality of diphtheria during recent years in Fulham, the adjoining boroughs, and London, will be seen in the two following tables, which give the rates of incidence and mortality of the disease in the several localities.

Both Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever being especially diseases of children, we must expect that the daily aggregation of such individuals will tend to widen their prevalence, especially as, not infrequently, the disease being of a mild type, children actually suffering have been found to be attending school. The following tables give the number of children in actual attendance at each school who were notified in each month as suffering from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria:— 38 TABLE XXXVII.

There was an especial prevalence of the disease during the last week of July and the first three weeks of August, 43 cases being notified in that period. Careful enquiries were made into the cases, especially as to the possibility of the infection having been connected with the food supply, but no explanation was forthcoming of the outbreak, which occurred before the usual autumnal increase of the disease was established. The localised prevalence of the disease was, of course, strongly against the supposition that it could have been connected with the water supply, but it may be mentioned that Drs. Crookes and Dewar reported that between the 6th and 15th July, which was about the period when the bulk of the cases were infected, the disease being in many instances not notified until a week or two after the commencement of the illness, "nearly the whole of the liltered water of the different companies derived from the Thames and Lea showed an excessive number of microbes per cubic centimetre, far above the variations permissible as showing the difference between good and bad filtration." Secondary Cases. In 14 instances the disease was apparently communicated by personal infection by a previous case in the same house, 4 secondary cases occurring in each of two houses, 2 in one house, and 1 in each of 4 houses. Imported Cases. In 15 instances the disease was contracted outside the borough. Fatality. There were 20 deaths from the disease, giving a case mortality of 148 per cent., the average for the past 8 years being 20.8. Of the 92 cases treated in hospital, 9, or 10 per cent., and of the 43 treated at home 11, or 25 per cent., proved fatal. 41 Comparative Incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulham. The following table shows the incidence of Enteric Fever in Fulham, the adjoining boroughs, and the County of London, during the last ten years:— TABLE XXXIX.

One case of Continued Fever was notified, and 2 deaths were registered from Febricula and Low Fever respectively, which are included among the deaths due to the principal zymotic diseases. Puerperal Fever. Seven cases of Puerperal Fever, or 1.5 per 1,000 births, were notilicd, and 6 deaths, or 1.3 per 1,000 births, were registered. One death was that of a woman who was admitted into the Western Hospital, certified to be suffering from Enteric Fever. Erysipelas. Luring 1901, 131 persons were certified to be suffering from Erysipelas, which was the assigned cause of 9 deaths. Cholera. One case was notified as Cholera which was of the nature of English Cholera. 42 Isolation of patients suffering from infectious diseases. Accommodation for persons suffering from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Typhus Fever, and Small Pox, is provided by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at their various hospitals, and the increasing recognition by the public of the advantages accruing from the isolation of the infectious sick, is shown by the steadily increasing proportion of patients suffering from those diseases who are removed to hospital.

Measles.—Measles caused 38 deaths, as compared with 50, 59, and 80 in the three preceding years. The death-rate from the disease in Fulham, the adjoining boroughs and London was :— TABLE XLI. Death-rate from Measles. Fulham 0.27 Kensington 0.43 Hammersmith 0.41 Chelsea 0.13 County of London 0.43 * In these years the accommodation in the Board's hospitals was inadequate, and many patients remained at home who otherwise would have been removed. 43 Measles and Elementary Schools. In December, owing to the prevalence of Measles among the children in attendance, the Infants' Departments in Munster road and Kingwood Road board schools were closed fur three weeks. Whooping Cough. Seventy-six deaths were ascribed to Whooping Cough, of which 63 occurred in the first six months of the year. The death-rate from the disease in Fulham was 0 55, and in the County of London 0.36, the mean rate in Fulham for the 8 previous years being 0.50. Influenza. Fifteen deaths were registered from Influenza, the smallest number for the last 10 years. Diarrhœa. Diarrhoea was more prevalent than in 1000, 181 deaths being ascribed to it, compared with 156 in that year, but there was a slight decrease in the deaths from Enteritis, which numbered '27, against 34 in 1900 The following table gives the diarrhœal death-rate in Fulham, the adjoining boroughs, and London, during the past 10 years, but in considering it, the want of uniformity that has prevailed in the classification of deaths from Diarrhoea, owing to the various names used in death certificates in respect of deaths due to epidemic diarrhoea, must be borne in mind. Thus in 1890, no less than 141 deaths were ascribed to Enteritis, nearly all of which were doubtless of the nature of epidemic diarrhoea, but since a letter was sent in 1900 to medical practitioners, informing them that the College of Physicians had recommended the entire disuse as synonyms of Epidemic Diarrhoea, of such terms as Gastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis; etc, there has been a marked diminution in the number of deaths under these latter headings 44 The following table gives the Diarrhœal death-rate of Fulham, London, and the adjoining boroughs, during the last 10 years:— TABLE XL1I.

Calculated in this way, the Diarrhœal rates for Fulham, the adjoining boroughs, and London, are as follows:— TABLE XLIII. Deaths from Diarrhœa per 1,000 Births in 1001. Fulham 39 Kensington 33 Hammersmith 38 Chelsea 24 London 30 Deaths from other diseases. Tubercular diseases.—From Tubercular Diseases there were 265 deaths, 186 being due to Phthisis, and 79 to other tubercular diseases, such as Tubercular Meningitis, Tabes Mesenterica, and General Tuberculosis, and it is probable that 45 many of the diseases ascribed to Marasmus, Debility, Convulsions, etc., were tubercular in nature. In the several wards of the borough the death-rates from Phthisis and other tubercular diseases were as under:— TABLE XL IV.

Councillors Avern, Easton, Jones, and Sayer, and the Medical Officer of Health attended the British Congress on Tuberculosis which was held in London in July last, as delegates from the Borough Council, and submitted a report to the Council dealing with certain of the questions discussed at the Congress, and making the following recommendations:— 1. That the Council continue to use all the powers at their disposal, and relax no effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis by milk and meat. 2. That a system of voluntary notification of cases of phthisis attended with tuberculous expectoration be adopted by the Council. 3. That disinfection after death from phthisis be carried out in all cases where practicable. 4. That the Council endeavours as far as possible, by leaflets, See., to instruct the public respecting the infectiousness of phthisis and the consequent danger caused by indiscriminate spitting. 5. That the Council call the attention of the Guardians of Fulham to the necessity for sanatoria for the segregation of the consumptive poor. The Council resolved to adopt the recommendations of the delegates, and a system of voluntary notification is now in force in Fulham. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 119 deaths, being 21 in excess of the average of the previous 8 years, allowing for the increase of the population. Venereal Diseases. These were the assigned cause of 10 deaths, 15 of which were due to congenital syphilis, but a considerable proportion of other fatal diseases, more particularly those of the nervous system, are due to syphilis, 47 Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of Liver. Twenty-seven deaths were attributed to alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver, and in 10 cases the disease to which death was attributed was stated to have been accelerated by alcohol, though these probably represent but a small proportion of the actual number. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases, excluding phthisis, there were 436 deaths, or '20 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 50 below the average of the last 8 years, allowing for the increase of the population. Diseases of the Heart. Diseases of the heart caused 127 deaths, the average for the preceding 8 years being 115. Diseases and Accidents of Parturition. Six deaths were registered as due to diseases and accidents of parturition, and, including the deaths from septicaemia, the total number of deaths reported as occurring within 21 days of childbirth was 15, or one death to every 306 births. Deaths from Violence. Different forms of violence caused 86 deaths, viz.:— TABLE XLVI. Falls 20 Murder 7 Drowning 6 Burns 4 Suffocation of infants in bed 22 Suffocation by food o Otherwise 14 75 Suicides 9 Manslaughter 1 Murder 1 86 48 Certification of the Causes of Death. Of the 2,179 deaths registered, 1,984 or 91 per cent, were certified by registered medical practitioners and 194 by the Coroner after inquest, only one death being uncertified. Inquests. In 108 inquests the death was returned as due to natural causes, and in 80 to some form of violence. The accidental deaths have been already classified and those due to natural causes may be classified as follows:— TABLE XLVII. Zymotic diseases 9 Tubercular „ 7 Respiratory „ 28 Circulatory „ 24 Convulsions and other diseases of the nervous system 12 Other diseases 28 108 DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. Although the two boroughs, Fulham and Hammersmith, which formerly constituted the Fulham Union, are now separated for poor law purposes, the poor of Hammersmith are still, by an arrangement between the Board of Guardians, received into this institution. In 1901, the deaths of 493 persons occurred in the Infirmary and 10 in the Workhouse. Of these, 263 were parishioners of Fulham and 240 to Hammersmith and other districts. Western Fever Hospital. 166 deaths occurred in the Western Fever Hospital. Of these, 44 belonged to Fulham and 122 to other metropolitan boroughs. 49 Of the 2,179 deaths registered during the year 540 or 249 per cent. took place in public institutions, the percentages in the several classes of institutions being as under:— TABLE XLVIII. Percentage of total Deaths. Deaths occurring in Workhouses and Workhouse Infirmaries 12.2 Deaths occurring in Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 8.3 Deaths occurring in other Hospitals 8.0 Deaths occurring in Public Lunatic and Imbecile Asylums 1.4 24.9 Deaths occurring outside the District among persons belonging thereto. The deaths of residents in Fulham in public institutions and elsewhere outside the borough numbered '248, and occurred in the following places:— TABLE XLIX. St. George's Hospital 76 West London Hospital 30 Westminster Hospital 4 St. Thomas' Hospital 3 Middlesex Hospital 3 London Hospital 2 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1 Charing Cross Hospital 1 King's College Hospital 1 Jubilee Hospital 3 German Hospital 1 Temperance Hospital 2 Victoria Hospital for Children 13 Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children 3 Belgrave Hospital for Children 2 Brompton Hospital for Consumption 6 Cancer Hospital 7 National Hospital for Nervous Diseases 2 Chelsea Hospital for Women 1 Carried forward 170 50 Brought forward 170 Queen Charlotte's Hospital 2 General Lying-in Hospital 1 Grove Fever Hospital 10 Fountain Fever Hospital 5 South Western Fever Hospital 3 Hospital Ship 3 Banstead Asylum 7 Cane Hill Asylum 6 Dartford Asylum 5 Hanwell Asylum 4 Manor Asylum 3 Colney Hatch Asylum 1 Claybury Asylum 1 Middlesex Asylum 1 Caterham Asylum 1 Chelsea Workhouse 2 St. Peter's Home, Kilburn 1 St. John's Home 1 Elsewhere 15 248 Public Mortuary. 199 bodies were removed to the Mortuary during the year and were admitted as follows:— At the request of the Coroner 183 Brought in by the Police 15 At the request of the Medical Officer of Health 1 199 Inquests were held on 198, and post-mortem examinations were made in 107 of the above cases. Disinfection. Infected articles have, since March last, been disinfected at the Council's Disinfection Station in Townmead road. The station is most complete and the provision of a well equipped laundry enables articles to be washed, which was not done when the work was carried out by a contractor. 51 Bacteriological Examinations. The arrangements made by the late Vestry in 1897 with the Tenner Institute of Preventive Medicine for the bacteriological examination of suspected material, and increasing use is being made by medical practitioners of the facilities afforded them of availing themselves of this important aid to diagnosis, 342 specimens being examined compared with 102, 104, and 289 in the three preceding years. Diphtheria. Material from 277 cases was examined, and the Klebs-Loffier or true Diphtheria bacillus, was isolated in 92, and the Pseudo-Diphtheritic or Hoffmann's bacillus in 28. Enteric Fever. Blood from 44 cases was examined, and the Widal or Typhoid reaction was obtained in 33. Tuberculosis. Material from 20 cases was examined, and the bacillus of tubercle was found in 3. Rabies. An examination was made of a dog which had died with symptoms of rabies, having previously bitten three other dogs, but nothing suggestive of rabies was discovered. Certificates under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts. Under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts of 1890 and 1891, it is provided that the assessment to inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by additions or alterations and used for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings where the annual value of each dwelling shall not amount to .£20, shall be discharged by the Commissioners acting in the execution of the Acts relating to the inhabited house duties, if a certificate is obtained from the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the house is situate that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for 52 each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements. It is also provided that in the case of any house originally built or adapted by alterations or additions and used, so far as the same is used as a dwelling-house, for the sole purpose of providing separate dwellings at an annual value not exceeding £40 for each dwelling, the Commissioners shall, upon the production of the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, as before mentioned, grant relief by confining the assessment to the annual value of the house, exclusive of every dwelling therein of an annual value below .£20 (if any) and by reducing the rate of duty to threepence. All the certificates which had been previously granted under these Acts by the Medical Officer of Health were withdrawn by him in April, 1901, and owners were informed by the Surveyor of Taxes that if they desired exemption from, or abatement of inhabited house duty for the financial year ending April, 1902, application must be made to the Medical Officer of Health for a renewal of the certificate. Applications were made for certificates in respect of 458 houses containing 1,480 separate dwellings, and certificates were given for 122 houses containing 602 separate dwellings, and were refused for 190 houses containing 458 dwellings, and in respect of 146 houses containing 420 dwellings certificates were granted on the completion of certain specified work. Supervision of New Buildings. In March last, the duty of supervising the construction of the drains and sanitary appliances of new buildings was transferred by the Council from the Works Department to the Public Health Department, the two Drainage Inspectors who had been employed in that work being placed under the Medical Officer of Health, and Mr. T. H. Vercoe, who since 1896 had been employed in the supervision of the reconstruction of the drains of old buildings, was appointed Chief Drainage Inspector, 53 During the 10 months, the following plans of the drainage of new buildings were submitted to, and approved by the Public Health Committee:— Houses and Shops 413 School 1 Flats 10 Stables 3 Manufactories, &c. 5 432 Drainage By-laws. The By-laws made by the London County Council under Section '202 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for regulating the dimensions, form, and mode of construction, and the keeping, cleansing, and repairing of the pipes, drains, and other means of communicating with sewers and the traps and apparatus connected therewith, were sanctioned by the Local Government Board on June 14th, 1901, and are now enforced by the Borough Councils, so that henceforth there will be a uniform code of regulations in respect of house drainage and sanitary fittings in force throughout the Metropolis, exclusive of the City. By-laws have also been drafted by the London County Council under the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1899, but have not yet received the sanction of the Local Government Board, requiring the deposit with the Local Authorities of plans of proposed new drains and of any reconstruction or alteration of existing drains. Combined Drainage. Contracts amounting in all to £715 for the reconstruction of the "sewer portions" of 34 systems of combined drainage were entered into by the Council, and subsequently with the view of expediting this work by dispensing with the necessity for advertising for tenders for each separate job, it was resolved to invite builders to submit a schedule of the prices at which they would 54 undertake the reconstruction of the house drains for which the Council accepted liability for a period of six months. For this work the tender of Mr. G. Beagley was accepted, and up to the end of the year, £204 had been paid to him in respect of 13 systems of combined drainage. The sum of £62 10s. was also paid to owners of houses in respect of drainage work executed by them in compliance with the notices of the Council in connection with house drains which were "sewers" within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, so that the total cost to the Council of these "sewers " was £981 10s. Houses let in lodgings. In consequence of the difficulties that were experienced in connection with the definition of the term "landlord" in the existing by-laws, new by-laws were framed by the late Vestry and submitted to the Local Government Board, who after certain amendments, intimated that they were prepared to sanction them. The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to adopt the amended by-laws, and to apply to the Local Government Board for their confirmation, but the Council refused to adopt them. In the existing by-laws, the "landlord" is the person by whom the house is let in lodgings, and as such is responsible for the necessary repairs, and annual cleansing of the premises, but it has been found that very frequently he was but a weekly tenant, and was not in such a financial position as to be able to comply with the requirements of the Council. In the proposed by-laws as approved by the Public Health Committee and the Local Government Board, these duties were imposed upon the "owner" i.e., the person in receipt of the rack rent of the premises. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The following houses were represented under the above Act as being in a state so injurious or dangerous to health, as to be unfit for human habitation. 2, Vanston Place Closed by owner. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12, Bullow Road Closed by owner, since repaired and re-opened. 55 House lie/use. The necessity for a more frequent collection of house refuse, especially from flats, was again urged upon the Council, but in view of the heavy cost it was decided that a bi-weeldy system of collection could not be entertained. Smoke Nuisances. Eight abatement notices under the Public Health (London) Act, were served in respect of smoke nuisances, and one offender was prosecuted and fined £4 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. Bakehouses. These were regularly inspected during the year, and a summons was taken out against the owner of one which was found in a dilapidated condition, but was withdrawn on completion of the necessary work and payment of the costs. By the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, it is provided:— 1. That an underground bakehouse shall not be used as a bakehouse unless it was so used at the passing of the Act, i.e., on August 17th, 1901. 2. That after January 1st, 1904, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the Borough Council to be suitable for that purpose.. An underground bakehouse means a bakehouse, any bakingroom of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. 4. That an underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the Borough Council is satislied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. In the event of a refusal of a certificate by the Borough Council, the occupier may apply within 21 days from the refusal, to a Court of summary jurisdiction, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the Court, that the bakehouse is suitable for use as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects, the Court shall grant a certificate of suitability of the bakehouse, which shall have effect as if granted by the Borough Council. 56 Prosecutions under the Public Health (London) Act, and the Metropolis Local Management Act. Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, and the Metropolis Local Management Acts, were instituted in the following cases:— TABLE L. Defendant. Offence. Result. Penalty. Costs.
