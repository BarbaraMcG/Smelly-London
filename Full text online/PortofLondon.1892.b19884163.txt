SANITARY. REPORT, PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. WITH THE HALF-YEARLY REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PORT OF LONDON, To 30tii June, 1892. Presented 6th October, 1892. B EYANS, Mayor. A Common Council holden in the Chamber of the Guildhall of the City of London, on Thursday, the 6th day of October, 1892. THE Port of London Sanitary Committee did this day deliver into this Court a Report in writing under their hands, with the Half-yearly Report of the Medical Officer of Health to the 30th June, 1892; and recommending the appointment of an additional Inspector of the Port, at wages of 55s. a week; which was read. Resolved, That the consideration thereof be adjourned, and it is Ordered that the Report be printed, and a copy sent to every Member of this Court. MONCKTON. To the Bight Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled. We whose names are hereunto subscribed, of your Port of London Sanitary Committee, to whom it has been referred to carry into execution the Public Health Acts so far as the same relate to the Port of London, beg to submit for the consideration of your Honourable Court the Report of Dr. William Collingridge, the Medical Officer of Health of the Port for the half-year to the thirtieth June, 1892, which Report contains full and detailed information as to the work carried out in the Port by the Medical Officer and the Inspectors during that period. B 2 4 In the Report of the Medical Officer, attention is drawn to the necessity for the appointment of an additional Inspector to meet the increased work cast upon the Authority by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. With our sanction Dr. Collingridge has recently made a temporary appointment at 35s. a week, and we now ask for authority to confirm and continue such appointment should we consider it desirable to do so, reporting the same to your Honourable Court. In consequence of disagreements between the Caretakers at the Hospital it became necessary to dismiss them at the commencement of the year. We subsequently appointed Mr. and Mrs. Rayner, and Mr. and Mrs. Hearn to fill the vacant positions at wages of 25s. and 23s. a week respectively, and they continue to satisfactorily perform the duties required of them. The Cholera epidemic has anxiously engaged the attention of your Committee throughout the vacation and continues to do so, and the several Orders issued by the Local Government Board are being rigidly carried out by the Medical Officer of the Port and his Assistants. We have found it necessary to temporarily augment the medical staff, so that the ordinary work of sanitary inspection may not suffer on account of the extra vigilance which is required in the case of ships arriving from Cholera-infected Ports. It will be our duty before long to bring up a full report to your Honourable Court with reference to the precautionary measures taken by us to prevent the spread of infection. All which we submit to the judgment of this Honourable Court. Dated this sixth day of September, 1892. J. N. Pimm. A. H. Barber. David Burnett. Daniel Greenaway. W. G. Howard. Thomas Wild ash. T. G.

July, 1892. TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE PORT OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith a short account of the Sanitary work carried out by your officers in the Port during the first half of the present year (1892). In Appendix A it will be seen that the total number of vessels inspected was 8,167, of which 216 only, or 2.6 per cent. required any special cleansing, and in the majority of these the actual requirements were comparatively small. Obviously, however, the main object of continuous Sanitary supervision is to gradually diminish the number of the latter class, which, with the slightest relaxation of vigilance would be found rapidly to increase in number. The chief aim of Sanitary work is the prevention of disease, and its theoretical carrying out would tend to render its existence impossible, while the practical result is clearly shown in the immunity of the country from imported disease. Of the total number of vessels inspected, no fewer than 7,022 = 85.98 per cent. of the total number were sailing under the British flag, while the Scandinavians and Germans follow with 5'63 per cent. and 4.59 per cent. respectively. (See Appendix B.) This shows a small falling off in the British, and a corresponding increase in the foreigners. In Appendix E a list is given of the structural alterations carried out by order of the Port Sanitary Authority for the improvement of the Sanitary condition of vessels. 248 such have been completed, affecting 208 vessels, while 15 only, affecting 13 vessels, are still either not yet finished or have not since been inspected. In my last Half-yearly Report certain remarks were made with reference to the carrying out by Board of Trade officers of the "Instructions to their Surveyors." It was there mentioned that practically these Regulations were never carried out in their entirety, the reasons being, firstly the fact that they go 8 beyond the legal requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act, and secondly because of the small staff at the disposal of the Board. These remarks were objected to by the Board of Trade as presumably indicating a want of care on the part of the Board Officers. The statement specially traversed was the one that in the case of a new ship all the requirements were rarely carried out. By arrangement with the Board of Trade special note was taken of all new vessels arriving in the Port. Eleven new vessels were inspected during this period, and in every case some defect, as indicated by the Regulations, was discovered and reported to the Board. In all cases an inspection was ordered by the Board's officials and the defects remedied. The largely increased powers thrown upon your officers by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, have naturally greatly increased the work of the staff, and I am now compelled to ask you for an immediate increase in order that the work may be thoroughly and efficiently carried out. The increased supervision of meat and provisions would alone justify the appointment of an additional inspector. On a reference to Appendix H, it will be seen that there were thirty-six distinct seizures of food within the six months, and thirtyfour in the previous six months. Although in the majority of these cases the quantities dealt with are not large, the three largest involving the seizure of 951, 852, and 118 carcases respectively, still the time occupied in examining is very great, and obviously an inspector engaged on such work is drawn from his ordinary routine. At the present moment the actual Sanitary work other than the inspection of meat, requires increased care and attention, and I would therefore lay great stress on the immediate appointment of an additional inspector. By a careful re-arrangement of duties, and definition of the limits of the districts to be inspected, the staff would then be sufficient for the work. It is a serious question to consider whether it is wise to appoint an inspector whose whole duty it would be to examine food consignments, or whether, as at present, the additional inspector should undertake general duty. I believe the latter course would be the safer one to try, and to re-arrange the work if unsatisfactory. The objection to the special appointment of a meat inspector would be the large amount of ground he would have to cover, the loss of time and expense of travelling, while in the case of the Tilbury Docks (20 miles from London) it would be practically impossible to make any other arrangement than the present one. With regard to the expense of an additional inspector, already a return of about 25l, per annum is received by the Port Sanitary Authority for the expense of inspection, in accordance with a resolution of Committee, and if increased time could be given to this important work, no doubt this could be also augmented. Special attention has been paid by your officers to the question of the supply and storage of water on board ship for drinking purposes, in view of its extreme importance in preserving the health of the mercantile marine. 9 Wherever water-barges are in use their regular and systematic inspection is carried out, and a return made periodically as to their condition and state of repair. A large proportion of the water supplied to ships in London is delivered on board in a quick and cleanly manner by hose direct from the mains on the quays in the Dock, in some instances at the rate of a ton in four minutes, but while lying in the river and in some of the docks, owing to the absence of mains, the water has to be pumped on board from barges. These barges are of an average capacity of 50 tons, being decked over and provided with fly-wheel pumps. Until the last few years these barges were entirely constructed of wood, with or without a presumably water-tight skin, but owing to the increased use of iron tanks for the storage of water on board the ships, it was deemed advisable to discourage as much as possible the use of wood. Obviously, however objectionable this material might be from a Sanitary point of view, there was no legal power to order its discontinuance. Therefore as the wooden barges became old and unsuited for the purpose of conveying water, extensive repairs became necessary, and as these were always insisted upon, iron barges becoming cheaper in the long run were gradually substituted for them. The great advantages of increased cleanliness, lessened liability to leakage, and the absence of decaying organic matter, lead one to hope that before long wooden water barges will be unknown in London. Next in importance to the supply is the question of the receptacles in which water is stored on board vessels, where iron tanks have almost completely superseded the old wooden casks. The exceptions are a certain proportion of our small coasters, and some foreign sailing vessels, but even in these the iron tank is being gradually introduced. The number of vessels in which this beneficial change has been brought about through the action of your authority is very large. The quantity of fresh water carried on a ship varies in proportion to the length of voyage and the number of persons on board, where cattle are carried a large additional supply being required. Whereas on a large mail steamer carrying passengers to Australia we find storage room of 30,000 gallons of water, 3,000 gallons only would be supplied on a sailing ship with a crew of 20 all told for the same voyage, in the latter case provision being made for a period in excess of the anticipated duration of the passage. No member of the crew of a steamer is ever confined to this very small allowance, but in British sailing vessels making long voyages economy is strictly enforced. C 10 The allowance of water is served out daily for each man ; two quarts out of each man's allowance being handed over to the Cook for Tea, Coffee, Soup, &c., leaving one quart only for drinking and washing. Every ten men would thus have 2½ gallons per day, a totally inadequate amount, especially in hot weather. This amount is of course, whenever practicable, supplemented by whatever rain water can be collected. There is no doubt that this allowance should be increased to, at any rate, four quarts per day, and it is to be hoped that in any revision of the present victualling scale this point will receive attention. The capacity of storage for drinking water has been greatly increased by the adoption of iron tanks, while at the same time the number of hands carried as crew has been considerably diminished. A sailing vessel, carrying 35 men twenty years ago, would in these days of labour-saving appliances only muster 25. The following calculations will show that wooden casks were responsible for a great waste of space through broken stowage. Supposing a sailing vessel were laying in a supply of drinking water for 18 hands for 90 days, she would require about 1,300 gallons, equal to 209 cubic feet. The extra cubic space required for iron tanks would be very small indeed. On the other hand, if the supply were carried in wooden casks 13 would be required. A rum puncheon of 100 gallons capacity measures over all 41¾ in. by 34¾ in. by 34¾ in., and making provision for stowage these dimensions would be 3 ft. 3 in. by 2 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 9 in., equal to 29 ft. 4 in. by 13 ft., equal to 382 cubic feet. Thus for 1,300 gallons in casks it would be necessary to provide 382 cubic feet of space to carry 209 cubic feet of water. As an instance, on the barque "Ingleborg" the water supply of 950 gallons was stored on the main deck in a tank and five casks. The tank had a capacity of 500 gallons and the five casks in front of the poop held 450 gallons. The tank was secured by iron bands and was stored on battens, the total space occupied being 108 cubic feet. The casks were on wooden chocks and retained in position by two strong backs, the total space taken up being 292 cubic feet. There was therefore a loss of storage room of 909 gallons, or, in other words, had all the water been earned in tanks the same space would have contained 1,839 instead of 950 gallons. It is always a bad plan, and indeed an unusual one, to carry the entire supply in one receptacle. If salt water enters it, the entire stock is spoiled, and if a leak occurs it is all lost. 11 But from a sanitary point of view there is the further serious objection that if a tank is always in use it is not likely to be often cleaned and limewashed. The position for the storage of tanks varies in different types of vessels, but amidships appears to be the favourite one, as in this case full or empty tanks does not mean any alteration in the trim of the ship. Easy access and daylight are the points to be aimed at in choosing a position. Not long since a water tank was discovered under the cabin deck of a sailing vessel, with the manhole in a position which prevented the slightest chance of its removal. And as a consequence it had not been cleansed since it was placed in the ship. On some recently new steamers where no passengers were carried, and where deck space was not valuable, the water tanks were found on the main deck, either abaft the engine room in the alleyways or under the top-gallant forecastle deck. Of these the first was the best, as giving more light and being easier of access. Preference, however, is to be given to the method adopted on the Ocean Line steamers, where there are two tanks resting on the bottom of the hold, and rising two feet above the main deck. On the top of each tank is a manhole, and a pump with a packed gland preventing the introduction of sea water or dirt. When the manhole is removed daylight streams down in the tank, and cleaning, &c., can be carried out with the aid of artificial light. The supervision of the necessary work, it is needless to say, is more likely to be attended to with this arrangement than in the case of tanks stowed out of sight. Except for the use of passengers and officers, filters are not found in the Merchant Service, notwithstanding the doubtful sources from which water has at times to be taken. In the large lines the water tanks are cleaned and cement-washed regularly, and in one of the Mail Companies the custom obtains of doing this work on the arrival of every steamer in dock, unless the chief officer reports in writing that this has been done within the month previous. Although a general willingness exists on the part of masters to carry out the orders of the Authority regarding tank and cask cleaning, occasional exceptions are met with, though those generally are foreigners. A Norwegian barque, for instance, arrived in the Victoria Dock with timber from a pitch pine port. All hands forward were laid up with Malarial Fever, and one was lying dead at the time. C 2 12 The crew were taken to Hospital, and although there could be but little doubt as to the relation between the illness and the water supply, the master strongly objected to the waste of so much good water. As there are many parts of the world where good drinking water cannot be obtained, and ofttimes only at great expense, there is an obvious advantage in having a large storage capacity. If, added to these considerations, one remembers that a Norwegian or Swedish sailor gets as much fresh water as he requires, it seems at any rate reasonable that an allowance of at least a gallon a day for all purposes should be granted to the British Seaman. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. By the regulations originally made under section 125, Public Health Act, 1875, and now Bye-laws under the Public Health Act, 1891, the master or other person in charge of any vessel entering the Port is bound to report any case of Infectious Disease to the Medical Officer of the Port Sanitary Authority stationed at Gravesend, and to cause the vessel to remain off the Custom House until the Medical Officer has boarded her. He is further bound to remove the case to the Hospital provided under the instructions of the Medical Officer. Should such disease break out on board any vessel after she has passed Gravesend, he is bound to report such case to the Medical Officer of Health at Greenwich, and to remove the patient under his directions. The diseases to which these Bye-laws apply are : small-pox, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, scarlet fever or scarlatina, typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal fever and measles. Any master or other person having charge of a ship arriving in the Port of London, and failing to perform any duty imposed upon him by these Byelaws, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding 5l. Under section 60, Public Health Act, 1891, the Sanitary Authority has power to serve a notice on the master or owner of any vessel requiring him to disinfect the safd vessel within a certain time specified therein, and it the master or owner shall fail to carry out such disinfection, it shall be performed at the cost of the Sanitary Authority. Under section 61, any Sanitary Authority may serve a notice on the owner of any bedding, clothing, or other articles which have been exposed to the 13 infection of any dangerous infectious disease, requiring delivery thereof to an officer of the Sanitary Authority for the purpose of destruction or disinfection, and if any person fails to comply with such notice, he shall, on the information of the Sanitary Authority, be liable to a fine not exceeding 10l. Thus the Master of a vessel failing to report disease, or to stop at Gravesend till the Medical Officer has boarded the ship, or to deliver articles for disinfection, is liable to a penalty. But beyond the penalty, the Port Sanitary Authority has no power of stopping or detaining a vessel. Her Majesty's Customs have no power to detain any vessel on account of infectious disease, except in the case of cholera, yellow fever, or plague. (In the case of cholera, the vessel is handed over to the Port Sanitary Authority under the Cholera Order. In the case of yellow fever or plague, the vessel is dealt with by Her Majesty's Privy Council). The Customs Officers have instructions to give immediate notice to the Local Authorities, if possible, before any sick person is landed, but the vessel may not be placed under detention. Clearly, if detention be necessary in the case of cholera and yellow fever it is also necessary in the case of any other infectious disease, and power should be given to the officers of Her Majesty's Customs to detain a vessel until handed over to the Local Authority, who should also have power to detain as long as necessary. Practically in nearly all cases it would be possible to take the necessary precautions without any detention at all, and in those very exceptional cases where delay might arise from loss of a tide, the advantage of safety to the public health should certainly override any other consideration. I would further point out the Quarantine Officers' questions as put to the masters of vessels on arrival are no real protection against any disease except cholera, yellow fever, or plague. A flagrant case having been reported to the Board of Customs, it was stated by their solicitor that it was very doubtful whether there could be a prosecution, as it is doubtful whether the " preliminary quarantine questions as to infectious disease can be held to " apply to esoteric or indigenous disease, and whether even an infectious " disease other than plague or yellow fever need be mentioned in answer to " these questions." On this being reported to your Worshipful Committee, a resolution was passed urging upon Her Majesty's Customs the advisability of obtaining power to deal with persons who give intentionally untrue replies to the quarantine questions. These revised regulations are not yet finally settled, though there can be no question that this weak point should be strengthened without further delay. 14 QUARANTINE. The history of the "Arawa" steamship, at the latter end of the nineteenth century, in a country which has done away with the barbarous system of Quarantine, is an interesting and instructive one. This unfortunate vessel had on her homeward voyage a few cases of yellow fever, the last being attacked on the 13th January, and the last death taking place on the 16th, while the vessel was coaling in quarantine at Teneriffe. She arrived at Plymouth on the 21st, and was visited by the Privy Council Medical Officer and sent to the Motherbank, where she arrived at noon on the 23rd, remaining till the 24th at 6 p.m. Two of the patients still under treatment were removed to the quarantine hulk, accompanied by the ship's surgeon, thus leaving the vessel herself in quarantine without medical assistance. The saloon, state-rooms, and crew spaces were all disinfected with nitrous oxide, and the passengers were made to pass through the fumes. On her arrival in London it was decided that the whole of the cargo, consisting largely of wool, should undergo thorough disinfection. This was carried out in a very simple and ingenious manner. Dock labourers were stationed at the hatches armed with zinc syringes, and a tub of weak cold solution of carbolic acid. As each bale was hoisted out of the hold a small quantity of this weak solution was gently sprayed over the outer wrapper of the bale. In this manner the majority of the bales were treated, many of them escaping altogether. As a means of disinfection it is obvious that the whole operation was absolutely useless, and adopted only as a concession to the idea for the necessity of some treatment. SMALL-POX. During the half-year eleven cases of small-pox have come under notice in the Port of London. In the majority of these cases the infection was derived in London. Details of each case are given in the Appendix, but one or two call for special attention. In one vessel where a single case occurred on the homeward voyage, and was properly isolated and fumigation carried out, the disease was conveyed by the transference of the crew to another of the same line. On the 11th March the Swedish steamer "Ocean," on arrival, reported a man ill, who on examination was found to have small-pox, and was removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital. 15 The vessel left Alexandria on the 23rd February, and the patient was attacked on the 9th March. On the 16th April the "Shannon," on arrival, reported an outbreak under the following circumstances. On the 22nd March she left Bombay with 125 time expired blue jackets on board, on the 27th one of these developed small-pox, and was isolated in the lifeboat until the following day, when he was taken ashore at Aden with all his clothing. On the 1st April a native fireman was landed at Suez with the same disease, both forecastles were then fumigated and limewashed throughout. On the 11th, two other blue jackets were attacked and were isolated in the post-office cabin on deck, and removed by the Naval Authorities to hospital at Plymouth. The vessel was fumigated in the Albert Dock. OTHER DISEASES. Nine cases of enteric fever have been discovered and dealt with. No special feature attaches to these, except the one attached to the difficulty of diagnosis in the early stages. Thus in three cases the disease was reported from the Seamen's Hospital, the patient having been admitted for some other or some undefined reason, diagnosis being only possible on development. TRAINING SHIPS. The health of the inmates of the training ships for the last half-year has been on the whole good, and little sickness has been reported. One case of enteric fever was removed from the "Cornwall" reformatory ship lying off Purfleet. The patient, who had only been on the ship a week before being taken ill, was removed to the ship's hospital on shore. On the 5th January a case of enteric fever was removed from the London School Board ship " Shaftesbury " lying off Grays. On the 8th June a case of small-pox was reported on the training ship "Cornwall." The boy had been ill for two or three days with weakness and pains in the head, but small-pox was not diagnosed until the 28th, when he was sent across the river to the Asylum Board ships. 16 The patient had not been on shore for some months, but two or three cases were known to have occurred in the village, and several others within a short distance. The boys on joining the ship are vaccinated or re-vaccinated, this boy had been vaccinated in infancy, and re-vaccinated three times unsuccessfully since joining the ship. On the 25th June a case of diphtheria was reported on board the training ship "Worcester" lying off Greenhithe, and in the apparent absence of any other source of infection the Medical Officer of the ship suggested the foul condition of the river water as a possible source of infection. THE HOSPITAL. During the past six months five cases have been admitted into the Port Sanitary Hospital, two small-pox, one measles, one enteric fever, and one chicken-pox. It is my duty once again to call attention to the fact that there are no proper means of isolation of small-pox cases in the Hospital, and a certain amount of risk exists whenever they are treated in the present building together with other diseases. A small pavilion might easily be erected at a considerable distance from the present buildings at a small cost and separately administered. This would do away with the whole difficulty and the isolation of one disease from the other would be properly accomplished. METROPOLITAN SEWAGE DISCHARGE. There is practically nothing fresh to report with regard to the sewage question in the River Thames. This vast experiment is being energetically carried out, and is from time to time reported to have affected the condition of the river water. From constant observation of the river this would appear to be dependent mainly, if not entirely, upon climatic influences. Thus during the hot weather in the spring the river was in a bad condition, while during the month of June it materially improved. It has been previously pointed out that the Authorities are entitled to the utmost latitude with regard to the carrying out of a system which at present does not promise to be successful. CANAL BOATS ACT, 1884. There is practically nothing new to report with regard to Canal Boats. The inspection of these boats forms an integral part of the work of your 17 Inspectors, the breaches of the Act are few in number and trifling in character, and in no single instance daring the six months has the necessity arisen for prosecution. Probably no better example could be found of the improvement brought about by the judicious administration of a practical Act of Parliament. Briefly the result of these Acts has been to improve the condition of those brought under its control both physically and morally. One very important result has been to gradually diminish the number of women and children carried on the boats. Two hundred and thirty six have been inspected during the six months, while eight have been registered by the authority, one of these being a new boat, one re-registered owing to change of owners, and six owing to structural alteration. INFECTED CLOTHING. In nine cases infected clothing was brought into the Port and dealt with by your officers. In two cases these were the effects of small-pox patients, one cholera, two typhoid fever, one influenza, and one unknown. In each instance the facts were reported to the Board of Trade, and in nearly all these some explanation was received later on. SMOKE NUISANCE. In pursuance of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, all vessels plying above London Bridge, and between London Bridge and the Nore, have been watched for smoke nuisance. No proceedings have yet been taken, but in ten instances warning has been given to the owners and the nuisance has at any rate been temporarily abated. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM COLLINGRIDGE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, Port of London.
