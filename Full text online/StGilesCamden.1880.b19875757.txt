The Decease of Members. The Board received with extreme regret the announcement of the decease on the 29th of April last, of their friend and colleague, the late Henry Cooper, Esq., and on the 10th of May passed a Resolution expressive of its high appreciation of the valuable services rendered by him to the district while a member of this Board, and offering its sincere condolence with his family under their severe bereavement. Mr. Cooper was elected a member of the Board in the month of June, 1867. The Board, whilst this Report was in course of preparation, received intelligence of the decease, after a long and painful illness, of Mr. William Frederick Collard Moutrie, also a member of the Board. That gentleman was elected a member in the year 1877, from which period to within the last twelve months he actively attended to the duties of his office. Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. GREAT WILD STREET SCHEME. Very rapid progress has been made during the past year with this scheme. The widening of Princes (now Kemble) Street has been carried out. An extensive block of buildings, approved by the Confirming Act, has been erected, and is rapidly progressing to completion and fitness for occupation; it presents a very great improvement contrasted with the wretched habitations formerly standing on the site. The building has been erected by the Trustees of the Peabody Society, who have purchased this and other sites in the Metropolis, taken under the above Acts at a considerable reduction on their original cost. 9 LITTLE CORAM STREET SCHEME. This area presents about the same appearance as it did twelve months since. A very small portion of the wretched buildings thereon have been removed. The claims of the owners and tenants of part of the area are being investigated by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and dealt with. The concurrence of several parties interested in the scheme being necessary, some delay is caused in carrying out the same. COAL YARD AND GOLDSMITH'S ALLEY IMPROVEMENT. The Board has much pleasure in reporting that this Improvement has been completed. The purchase of the remaining land referred to in the Board's last Report has been carried out. The sewer and the foot and carriage-ways have been formed, and the street thrown open for public use. The Metropolitan Board of Works have, in accordance with their promise, contributed the sum of £1,126 10s. towards the cost of the acquisition of the land needed for the same. Enlargement of the Offices of the Board. It has been a well-founded complaint for many years past that the only public entrance to the Board Room and its Offices from Holborn has been by a lane only 10 feet wide and 120 feet long, continually used by the heavy waggons and carts conveying goods to the Stone Yard and to the Warehouses of adjoining Tradesmen, and that owing to this traffic it had become highly dangerous to persons having business at the Offices of the Board. A favourable opportunity occurred in the month of June, 1880, to purchase the freehold premises Nos. 197 & 198, High Holborn, and the extensive workshops and stabling adjoining, which were old and dilapidated, abutting on those of the Board. It accordingly entered into negotiations with the freeholder for acquiring the same, which resulted in the purchase thereof at the moderate price of £8,000. The Offices of the Board being too small, and in some respects very inconvenient, it has been resolved to enlarge the same, and erect in the rear on part of the premises so purchased additional Offices; to convert the present Board Room into Surveyor's Offices, and erect a new Board Room above the same. These works are now in progress, and will shortly be completed. It is believed that the surplus land will realise nearly sufficient to pay the cost of the purchase of the whole site. 10 Public Mortuary. The want of a Public Mortuary for this district has long been felt. The chapel at the Bloomsbury Burial Ground in Henrietta Street, Brunswick Square, is very old and dilapidated, and unfit for this purpose, to which, by the permission of the Bector of the parish, it is applied for the necessities of the extreme northern end of the district. There is also the want of a Coroner's Court and a Post-mortem Boom, the inquests in the district in many cases being held in taverns or public-houses where there are no rooms suitable for the purpose; and the attendance at a public tavern is to the better class of people highly objectionable and painful, affording also an opportunity for drinking, which often results in most unseemly behaviour. The average number of inquests in the district is about 90. Under these circumstances, the Board has been in search of a site whereon to erect a Mortuary, Coroner's Court, and Post-mortem Booms, and after considerable difficulty it has succeeded in finding the same, and has entered into an agreement with the Trustees of the Alms House Charities of these parishes to take on lease for 80 years, at a ground rent of £52 10s., a piece of ground on the west side of the new Street, formerly Goldsmith's Alley, measuring 74 feet in length by 23 feet in width, and to erect thereon a suitable Mortuary, Coroner's Court, Post-mortem Boom, and Offices, at an estimated cost of £1,600. The drawings for the same are in course of preparation. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The number of articles analysed during the year was 296. Proceedings were instituted in 18 cases, and convictions obtained in 14 cases; the summonses in the other cases being either withdrawn or dismissed. The fines and costs imposed amounted to £27 8s. 6d. The continued enforcement of the Acts in this district has very considerably abated the adulteration of articles of food. The Annual Beport of Dr. Bedwood, the Analyst, forms part of this Beport. Sanitary Acts. During the past year there have been 17 Summonses under these Acts, which have been heard by the Magistrates. Orders have been made for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. The Orders have been either complied with by the owners of the premises wherein the nuisances existed, or they have been enforced at the cost of such parties. 11 Water Supply. The burdensome rates imposed by the Water Companies of the Metropolis still continue. The present Government have promised to bring in a Bill based upon the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed last Session. The whole subject is in abeyance until this is done. July, 1881. THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE SAINT GILES DISTRICT.

GILES DISTRICT. 199, High Holborn, 28th June, 1881. Gentlemen,— I beg to lay before you the following Report on the works executed by your Board, during the year ending 25th March, 1881. New Pavings, Carriage-ways. Situation. Description of Paving. Net Cost. £ s. d. Great Queen Street, from Little Queen Street to Drury Lane New Wood Paring on concrete and asphalte foundation 1,452 8 5 Hunter Street Re-dressed Granite on concrete foundation 607 4 0 Bloomsbury Street, South of Oxford Street Ditto ditto ditto 350 14 9 Gate Street (East end) Ditto ditto ditto 276 7 9 Coal Yard, from Smart's Buildings to Drury Lane Ditto ditto ditto 142 4 5 Castle Street, from Endell Street to Great Earl Street Ditto ditto ditto 137 1 9 Lincoln's Inn Fields (East side) Footway. New Victoria Stone Paving 197 11 11 The following macadamized roadways were recoated with broken granite, steam rollers being used to consolidate the granite after it was spread:— Bedford Square, north and east sides, Russell Square, west side, Montague Place, and Chenies Street. A portion of the wood paving laid in Bloomsbury Square by the Improved Wood Paving Company (Limited) in September, 1875, being in bad condition, notice was served on the Company in January, 1881, to repair the same in accordance with the terms of its Contract 22 with the Board; the Company, accordingly, in March, 1881, at its own expense, removed the greater portion of the paving, including its plank foundation, and laid in lieu thereof new wood blocks on new concrete foundation. A portion of the wood paving in High Street, laid by Messrs. Mowlem and Company in October, 1875, being also in bad repair, was taken up by the Contractors, and new blocks laid in place thereof at their expense. New Sewers. The following lengths of new Sewers were constructed during the year:— Upper Bedford Place 720ft. lineal of brick sewer, 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. internal dimensions. Kenton Street (from Great Coram Street to Boundary of District) 420 do. do. Henrietta Street (from Kenton Street to Hunter Street) 300 do. do. Great Coram Street, (from Kenton Street to Brunswick Square) 310 do. do. Total 1750 ft. lineal of new brick sewers. A length of about 80 feet of the sewer in little Queen Street was underpinned ; this work was performed to enable the Holborn Restaurant to be drained, and the cost of the work was defrayed by the owner of the Restaurant. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public carriage-ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, each drawn by one horse, were used in sweeping the paved carriage-ways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 10,535 loads. The carriage-ways of High Holborn, Oxford Street, Little Queen Street, High Street, Hart Street, and Great and Little St. Andrew Streets, were washed on several occasions during the year by means of watering carts and the sweeping machines. The cost of the washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. 23 Removal of Snow. There were several falls of snow during the late winter, which involved considerable additional labour and cartage in clearing the public ways. On the 18th and 19th January a severe storm and heavy snowfall occurred ; the snow drifted very much, and it was difficult to ascertain the exact depth of the fall, but it certainly was not anywhere less than 6 inches, and was probably in many places considerably more, but assuming an average of 6 inches only over the public ways of the St. Giles district, it gives a total quantity of 60,000 cubic yards, which quantity was largely added to by what was thrown on to the public ways from the roofs and back yards of houses. The Board's contractor did, I believe, his best to remove the snow speedily, but the quantity was so large that your Board engaged additional horses and carts to assist in its removal. The total quantity of snow carted away was 9270 loads, of which 4080 were carted away by the Board's contractor without extra charge to the Board, and 5190 loads by the additional horses and carts hired by the Board. The total quantity of snow removed during the whole winter was 9490 loads. Street-orderly Boys. Eight boys and one man (as ganger) were employed during the year in cleansing the public footways in the district during wet and sloppy weather, and in collecting the horse droppings from the surface of the wood paving in High Holborn and New Oxford Street in dry weather. The total cost of the street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1881, was as follows:— f s. d. Wages of men and street-orderly boys 2,018 6 11 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 131 15 5 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and the snow removed under contract 2,332 6 8 Additional labour and cartage in removal of snow after the fall of the 18th and 19th January, 1881 601 19 3 Total cost of street cleansing and snow removal for the year £5,084 8 3 24 Street Watering- The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. The water for this purpose (including that used for street washing) was 3,953,000 gallons. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs of stand posts, &c., was 240 19 4 To contractors for carts, horses and men 754 16 0 Total £995 15 4 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, at a cost of £1666 13s. 4d. Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the mews, yards, courts, alleys, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of about £70. Public Urinals. The public urinals belonging to the Board are 18 in number, and contain 46 compartments; 10 of the urinals, containing 35 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others have not. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. List of Public Urinals in the St. Giles District. Bainbridge Street 5 compartments Water supply laid on Chenies Mews (North) 3 do. do.

One of Sugg's improved street lamps, fitted with argand burner, giving a light equal to 80 candles, was fixed on the crossing refuge at the south end of Tottenham Court Road in April, 1879. This burner did not give satisfaction owing to its frequently flaring and thus smoking the chimney enclosing it to such a degree as to considerably obscure the light; it was accordingly removed on 29th October, 1880, and Sugg's patent flat-flame burner substituted for it. This burner has proved satisfactory. One of Bray's patent lanterns and flat-flame burners was fixed on 19th March, 1881, on the refuge in Broad Street, opposite the south end of Dyott Street. The work of substituting the new improved circular lamps for those of the old square pattern was proceeded with. The total number of lamp-posts and lanterns of the new pattern in the District at Lady-day, 1881, was 319. Chalets de Toilette et de Necessite. On the 5th March, 1880, Mr. Watkyns applied to your Board for permission to erect certain chalets for the convenience of men and women in the public ways of your district. The chalets as proposed were to be of the following dimensions, viz., 20 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 13 feet 9 inches high to the ridge of roof; they were to be divided into two compartments with a separate entrance at each end, one end being for the use of men and the other for women; each compartment was to contain 4 w.c.'s, a dressing room and lavatories. On one side of the chalet a kiosque for the sale of newspapers and periodicals was proposed, it was to be in the form of a bay, 5 feet in length. The promoter, Mr. Watkyns, proposed that the Board should grant him a concession for the erection of one or more chalets for a term of thirty years, the concessionaire to pay the Board a rent of £10 per annum for each chalet erected within the district. He to be allowed 26 to charge persons using the ch&let three-half pence each for the use of the w.o.'s, and one penny each for the use of the lavatory and dressing room. At the expiration of the term of thirty years the chalets to become the property of the Board without payment. The proposal was fully considered by your Board, who had skeleton models erected in order to judge of the extent of public way that would be occupied by the proposed structures and their effect on the public traffic. One model was erected in High Holborn at its junction with New Oxford Street, and another in Broad Street, near to the south end of Bloomsbury Street. The Board finally resolved on the 23rd March, 1880, not to sanction their erection within the St. Giles District. The following is a list of the Contracts entered into by the Board and in force up to the 25th day of March, 1881:— Name and Address of the Contractor. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. J. J. Griffiths, 283, Kingsland Road. For the supply of granite and Yorkshire stone, as per schedule of prices. One year from 29th September, 1880. C. Killixgback, Ice Well Wharf, Camden Town. For the supply of sand, ballast, and hogan, and the cartage of materials, rubbish and gully refuse, as per schedule of prices. Ditto. G. Cookson, Gloucester Street, Albert Embankment. For the carting away of road sweepings from the public ways, for the sum of £1800. Ditto. G. Cookson, Gloucester Street, Albert Embankment. For the removal of the dust and ashes from the houses in the District, for the sum of £1550. Ditto. G. Cookson, Gloucester Street, Albert Embankment. For watering and washing the public ways, for the sum of £650. From lstMarch to 31st October, 1881. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, G. WALLACE, Surveyor. 27 1880.

The sewers have a length of about 2000 miles. "Elevation.—The population of London resides at a mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high-water mark; the elevation varying from 11 feet below high-water mark in Plumstead Marshes to 429 feet above high water-mark in Hampstead. "Houses.—At the Census in 1871 there were within this area 417,767 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7'8 persons to a house. Exactly corresponding with the proportion in 1861.

"In the three Indian Capitals, the rate of mortality in 1880 averaged 34.3 per 1000; it was 26.8 in Calcutta, 32.7 in Bombay, and 44.8 in Madras. "In twenty-two European cities the mortality averaged 30.8 against 22.7 in the twenty large English towns. *From the "Annual Summary" of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. 29 " The lowest rates in these cities were 20'3 in Christiania; 22 9 in Geneva; 23 1 in the Hague; and 24'2 in Rotterdam; whereas the rates ranged upwards to 36"0 in Trieste, 37'3 in Buda-Pesth, 401 in Madrid, and 46-1 in St. Petersburg. " The rate in Paris was equal to 29 0 per 1000, the deaths included 2266 from small-pox, 2130 from diphtheria and croup, and 2105 from typhoid fever. The death-rate from 'fever' in Paris in 1880, was nearly four times as great as in London; and that from small-pox and diphtheria more than eight times as great. "In St. Petersburg, however, the death-rate from 'fever' was nearly five times as great as it was in Paris. " Small-pox was more or less fatally prevalent in Vienna, BudaPesth, Triste, Rome, and Venice. " In Berlin, the third largest European city, the death-rate was equal to 29'9 per 1003; this high rate was in great measure due to diphtheria and summer diarrhœal diseases. " The death-rate in four of the largest American cities averaged 23-6." 30 THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT Gentlemen,— I have the honour to lay before you the Annual Report, for the year 1880, with the vital statistics of the District according to the Census returns of population in 1871. St. Giles District Contains a superficial area of 245 acres, And a density of population of 219 to an acre. The average elevation of the District is about 68 feet above Trinity high-water mark. St. George, Bloomsbury 17,843 The Population (Census 1871) St. Giles, South 19,089 St. Giles, North 16,497 Total 53,429 Marriages and Marriage-rate. There were 400 marriages during the year, viz.:— Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. St. Giles-in-the-Fields (Parish Church, High Street) Established Church 140 St. George, Bloomsbury (Parish Church, Hart Street) Established Church 160 Superintendent Registrar's Office 41 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 41 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 7 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 1 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesley an Methodist 5 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church - Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 1 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist 4 Total 400 The marriage-rate was 14 9 married to 1000 of the population, being a slight increase over the preceding year. 31 The number of marriages being 397, 390, 391, 415 and 382; the average marriage.rate for five years is 14.7 per 1000. The marriages in London during 1880 were 34,070. Births and Birth.rate. During the four quarters of 1880 there were 1500 children born in the District, 767 males and 733 females. The births registered in the three Sub.Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 394 St.. Giles, South 696 St. Giles, North 410 "Whole District 1,500 and equal to a birth.rate of 28 0 per 1000. This statement of births does not accurately represent the birthrate of either the District or its Sub.Districts and requires corrections, thus 145 of the births, viz., 23 at the Workhouse, Broad Street, and 122 at the British Lying.in Hospital, Endell Street, were children of mothers who belonged, by previous residence, to various other parishes in the metropolis, and must therefore be deducted, not only from the whole district, but also from the Sub.District of St. Giles, South, where they were registered. These corrections reduce the number of births in St. Giles, South, to 551, and in the whole District to 1355, and give an actual birth.rate of 25.3 per 1000. The following table will show these alterations more clearly:— Birth.rate in St. Giles and its Sub.Districts in 1880, and the Ratio of Births to Population, &c. Registration Sub.Districts. Population. Births Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. Average Birth Rate per 1,000 for 10 years 1870—79. St. George, Bloomsbury 17,843 394 1 in 45.2 22.0 25.8 St. Giles, South 19,089 551 1 in 34.6 28.0 30.9 St. Giles, North 16,497 410 1 in 40 2 24.8 301 Whole District 53,429 1,355 1 in 39.4 25.3 29.0 This birth.rate shows a further decline on the steadily decreasing rates of the six preceding years and is lower than that recorded in any year sinoe 1868, when the same rate prevailed. But it should be borne in mind that the foregoing averages are based on the Census tables for 1871, while we have good reason to believe that the population of St. Giles has largely decreased since that date. In the year 1880 the number of births in England and Wales was 880,520, and the birth.rate was equal to 34.6 per 1000. 32 The natural increase of population by excess of births over deaths was 352,464. The resident population of the United Kingdom in the middle of the year was estimated at 34,505,043. Deaths and Death-rate. During the four quarters of 1880, there were 1114 deaths in the District, 591 males and 523 females. The deaths registered in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 289 St. Giles, South 532 St. Giles, North 293 Whole District 1,114 and equal to a death-rate of 20.8 per 1000. This statement of registered deaths is open to the same objection as that of the births, and must therefore be similarly dealt with, viz., by deducting 51 deaths of non-parishioners who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street; the British Lying-in-Hospital, Endell Street; and the Infants' Home, Great Coram Street; and by adding the deaths of 205 parishioners who died in public hospitals and institutions for the sick, belonging to the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District Board, situated out of the district. These important corrections increase our number of deaths by 154 and give an actual death-rate of 23'7 per 1000, being an addition of no less than 31 per 1000 to the rate of deaths registered in the District. The ratio of deaths to population is as 1 to 421. The average death-rate for the ten years, 1870-9, being 23.9 and equal to 1 in 418 of the population. It is satisfactory to find the death-rate for the past year somewhat below it.

In 1880, 528,056 deaths were registered in England and Wales, equal to a rate of 20'7 per 1,000. St. Giles with its density of population is therefore only 3 per 1,000 above the average of the whole of the United Kingdom, and 1.5 per 1,000 above the average of the whole of the metropolis. Deaths of Infants. Of the 1,500 children born in the District during the year, 260 died under one year of age, which is equal to 1 death in every 5.7 of all registered births; 1 death in every 4.2 of all registered deaths. Deaths of Young Children. Again of these 1,500 births, 490 children died before attaining the age of five years, which is equal to 1 death in every 30 of all registered births, 1 death in every 2'2 of all registered deaths. The mortality was again high, and chiefly caused from the following diseases: bronchitis and chest complaints, 143; atrophy, &c., 55; whooping.cough, 43; convulsions, 38; measles, 35; diarrhoea, 32; scarlet fever, 29; hydrocephalus, 26; and mesenteric disease, 18. C 34 Deaths of Old People. 242 persons died at 60 years and upwards, the rate of mortality being as follows:—1 death in every 4.6 of all registered deaths, and in every 220 of population. Of the above, 40 deaths were of persons over 80 years of age. The Workhouse, Broad Street- There were 174 deaths in the Workhouse, including 20 parishioners belonging to the Strand Union. 1880 Number of Deaths. 1st quarter, ending March 25 53 2nd quarter, ending June 24 39 3rd quarter, ending September 29 43 4th quarter, ending December 25 39 Total deaths 174 In addition to these, 57 parishioners died at the Hospital of the Central Sick Asylum, in Cleveland Street; 19 at the Sick Asylum at Highgate; 40 at the Infirmary, Edmonton; 5 at Caterham Asylum ; 2 at Fulham Hospital; and 2 at Stockwell Hospital; making a total of 299 pauper deaths. My thanks are due to the officers of the various hospitals and public institutions for permitting me to search their books in order to obtain the above information. Mortuary. The Charity Commissioners have authorized the Trustees of the Parochial Almshouse Charities to grant the lease to your Board of 25, Macklin Street, Drury Lane, for the erection of a Public Mortuary, Post-mortem Room, and Coroner's Court, and which the District has long been in need of. When the building is completed, no doubt it will be much appreciated both by the Coroner and the Parishioners. Uncertified Deaths. The number of deaths registered as uncertified, that is to say, where no certificate has been given of the cause of death by a legally qualified practitioner, or no inquest has been held, appears to be increasing annually, both in many parts of the metropolis and the country. The uncertified deaths in this District are not many, for during the years 1875—78 they averaged only 6, but in 1879 they increased to 14; last year they were 11. Your Board considers that no uncertified deaths should be registered previous to some official investigation, and have therefore memorialized the Home Secretary, asking for legislation on the subject. 35 Inquests, During the year, 88 inquests were held upon persons in this District of whom 15 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 56 to St. Giles, South, and 17 to St. Giles, North. Of these, 35 died from natural causes, 8 from deaths accelerated by drinking habits, 13 from deaths accelerated by cold, exposure, and neglect, 21 from accidental causes, 5 from suicides, and 6 from homicide, infanticide, and manslaughter. The following were the verdicts returned by the juries:— Cause of Death. St. George, Bloomsbury. St. Giles, South. St. Giles, North. Total. Natural Causes, Exposure, and Neglect.

The following statistics refer to this hospital, which continues under its able management to render valuable assistance to a number of deserving poor married women during their confinement. During the year 142 women were delivered of 139 children born alive and 3 still-born; of the living children 67 were males, and 72 females. Only 17 of the mothers were parishioners, viz., 5 of St. George, Bloomsbury; 6 of St. Giles, South; and 6 of St. Giles, North. The remaining 122 resided in various metropolitan parishes before they came into the hospital for their confinement. There were 5 deaths (non-parishioners) in the hospital, viz., 3 mothers and 2 children; of the mothers, one died, aged 39, from placenta prsevia; another, aged 27, from pneumonia; the other, aged 41, from cancer uteri; of the children, both died shortly after birth, one from marasmus, the other from syphilis. The Infants' Home, No, 35, Great Coram Street. Two children died at this Infants' Home or Nursery:--1, aged 6 months, from atrophy and debility, the other, aged 6 weeks, from syphilis ; both were returned as children of female domestic servants. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. The following interesting tabulated report of the cases, shows that the Institution has again done good service during the past year to the sick poor of the District. The Resident Medical Officer, Dr. Steele, and the Staff promptly aid us in our endeavours to prevent the spread of infectious disease.

I. SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Small-Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping- Cough, Fever and Diarrhcea. Number of deaths from these diseases in England and Wales, 82,537, and equal to a death-rate of 3.22 per 1,000. Number of deaths from these diseases in the metropolis, 13,681, and equal to a death-rate of 3'7 per 1,000. Number of deaths from these diseases in St. Giles District, 190, and equal to a death-rate of 3.55 per 1,000. Small Pox (decennial average, 14.0).—The deaths by small-pox in London, which were 2,544 in 1871, 1,416 in 1878, 458 in 1879, were 475 in 1880. The annual rate of mortality from small-pox to 10,000, living in the 30 years, 1841—70, was 3.1, but owing to the severe epidemic of 1871—2, it rose in the nine years, 1871—9 to 4.9. No parishioners of St. Giles died from it in 1879, and only 10 mild cases were removed to hospital. The District was reported to be free from the disease from August, 1879, until the end of February, 1880, when it re-appeared in Betterton Street, Drury Lane; from that date until the end of the year, 9 persons were attacked and removed to Fulham and Stockwell Hospitals, where 3 died. The 9 patients (6 adults and 3 children) resided in the following places, viz.:— 2 in Betterton Street. 1 in New Compton Street. 1 in Newton Street. 1 in Store Street. 1 in Keppel Mews, North. 1 in Marchmont Street. 1 in Gate Street. 1 in Little Coram Street. The following return will show the monthly admission of vaccinated, doubtfully vaccinated, and unvaccinated small-pox patients from this district into hospitals belonging to the Asylum Board daring the year 1880. 38 Total Admissions and Deaths (Vaccinated, Doubtfully Vaccinated, and UnVACCINATED). 1880.

The late Mr. Marson, who was for 40 years Resident Medical Officer of the London Small-pox Hospital at Highgate, has stated that he has never known small-pox to affect any one of the nurses or servants so protected. The official returns from the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board show that in the two epidemics, the nurses and servants of those establishments were protected from small-pox by efficient vaccination, and every person employed was subjected to secondary vaccination previous to entering on their duties there. Vaccination of Infants.—Mr. Yardley, the Vaccination Officer of the Guardians, habitually visits, whether small-pox is epidemic or not, houses which are let out in tenements, to discover unvaccmated children, and urge parents to take such children to the public vaccinator. But notwithstanding this frequent visitation, many children in our migratory population escape vaccination. Re-Vaccination.—Medical men rightly think that all persons ought to be re-vaccinated as they become adults, and if this secondary vaccination be well performed, the person is protected for life, and this opinion appears to be justified by the experience of the re-vaccination of attendants in all the small-pox hospitals. The following return, kindly supplied to me by Mr. Yardley, relating to the vaccination of children born in the District, will be found interesting:— Return respecting Vaccination op Children whose Births were Registered during the Year. (For the period from July 1, 1879, to June 30, 1880.)

The several parishes of the metropolis have no means of their own for such isolation, and in 1867 the Metropolitan Poor Act was passed and the Asylum Board was called into existence for the treatment of poor persons belonging to the unions or parishes in the metropolitan area, who may be suffering from infectious diseases. The establishment of this Asylum Board relieved all the parishes in the metropolitan area of the duty of treating their paupers when so suffering, by performing that duty for each and every parish. The Asylum Board, acting under the authority of the Local Government Board, has performed this duty, but has lately been checked by law proceedings which are still pending. It has been suggested that in the event of the closing of the several Hospitals of the Asylum Board, the several parishes should establish Hospitals of their own, for the isolation and treatment of their paupers; if such a suggestion cannot be carried out by suburban parishes having an open country at their disposal, it is quite clear that parishes like our own, without an open country on any side of it, cannot act on such a suggestion. And, as the nuisance authority, your Board could not allow the erection of a hospital for an infectious disease in the midst of its crowded streets, for such a hospital would no doubt be a nuisance per se, and render you liable to law proceedings. Measles (Decennial Average, 26.9) was more fatal throughout the country in the first three months of 1880, than in any corresponding period since 1874. The District lost 37 children from it, nearly double of the preceding year, and in excess of the decennial average. Scarlet Fever (Decennial Average, 327).—This District, in common with the metropolis, suffered severely from an epidemic of Scarlet Fever, which continued throughout the year, and reached its intensity in August during the hot weather, when more that 50 children (chiefly belonging to the poor) were reported to be suffering from it. Scarlet Fever is a difficult epidemic to deal with and remains a long time in a district chiefly on account of the objection of parents to allow their children to be isolated by removal to a fever hospital. The children remain with their parents in rooms where isolation is impossible, where visitors are freely received, who carry away infection, and where there are no means for disinfection of the clothing and rooms. Of the total number of cases reported during the year only 20 were removed to the hospital. 42 The deaths were 45, including 2 in Charing Cross and Stockwell Hospitals. Diphtheria (Decennial Average,3.3).—The mortality of 14 from this disease is very heavy and much above the decennial average; most of the deaths were children under 5 years of age, residing in the parish of Bloomsbury. Two of the patients were admitted to the Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street, and died there. Whooping Cough (Decennial Average, 34.3).—We have again this year to deplore a heavy loss from this distressing infantile disease, for no less than 45 children died of it; it prevailed nearly all over the District, but was especially severe in St. George, Bloomsbury, and in St. Giles, South. Fever, including Typhus, Typhoid and simple continued Fever (Decennial Average, 22.1) Typhus.—This infectious form of fever, which in the previous year remained nearly three months in the District and caused great anxiety, happily has not re-appeared, for during 1880, no sickness or death was recorded from it, either in hospitals or the District. Typhoid and simple continued Fever.—In these other forms of fever, the District has been equally free, for only 7 deaths were registered from them, being considerably below the average. The following tables will show the admission of the fever cases from this District into the hospitals belonging to the Asylum Board during the year 1880:— Hospitals. Scarlet. Typhoid Typhus. Other diseases Total admissions. DEATHS.. Scarlet. Typhoid Typhus. Other diseases Stockwell 6 l - l 8 l _ _ - Deptford 14 l - 2 17 - - - - Total 20 2 - 3 25 l - - - The Registrar-General, in his Annual Summary for 1880, states:— " The death-rate ascribed to fever fell nearly 60 per cent, below the average of the three preceding decennia. The meaning of this will perhaps be better appreciated if stated in another form. Had, then, the death-rate from fever remained at its previous level, in London alone nearly 19,000 more persons would have died from this cause during the ten years, than as a matter of fact did die from it. It is probably a low estimate to say that for each fatal case of fever there are 4.4 more which are not fatal. We may therefore conclude that sanitary measures have preserved more than 102,000 Londoners in the last ten years from being attacked by fever." 43 Diarrhoea (Decennial Average, 58.4).—The deaths from diarrhoea numbered 39 (of which 32 were children), against an average of 58.4 for the ten preceding years. This low death-rate may be accounted for by the extreme wet and cold which prevailed in the summer. The disease notably attacks young children during the hot weather, and its fatality varies with the temperature. THE OTHER ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Total deaths, 38. METRIA (puerperal or lying-in fever) was fatal to 5 poor women soon after their confinement; Croup carried off 11 children; Erysipelas caused 4 deaths; Quinsy 1; Rheumatism (accute and chronic) 3; Alcoholism (delirium tremens) 1; Syphilis destroyed 7 children all under 1 year of age, and Quotidian Ague, a disease rarely fatal in London, was stated to be the cause of 1 death. II. PULMONARY DISEASES. (Other than Phthisis.) Total deaths, 291. Death-rate per 1,000, 5.4. The deaths from the following diseases were :—Bronchitis, 210; Pneumonia, 65 ; Laryngitis, 3 ; Pleurisy, 4; Asthma, 2 ; and other Lung diseases (excluding consumption), 7. The mortality is high, but less than in the preceding year— Bronchitis again heads the list with 210 deaths, 85 being children under 1 year, and 114 those of persons above 40 years of age, showing that the disease chiefly attacks the very young and old. III.—TUBERCULAR DISEASES. Total deaths, 146. Death-rate per 1,000, 2.73. Includes Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes. No deaths were recorded either from Scrofula or Rickets. Tabes (Consumption of the bowels or mesenteric disease) was fatal to 19 children. Phthisis (Consumption).—Carried off 127 persons at various ages, ranging from 1 to nearly 80; the deaths between 1 and 20 years, were 10, between 20 and 60 years, reached 107, above 60 years, declined to 10. The mortality of consumptive patients in St. Giles, South, the registration Sub-District in which the Workhouse is situated, was double of either of the other Sub-Districts. IV.—WASTING DISEASES OF INFANTS. (Under 5 years.) Total deaths, 74. Death-rate per 1,000, 1.38. Includes Atrophy and Debility, Want of Breast Milk and Premature Birth. No death was registered from want of breast milk, 44 Premature Birth was the assigned cause of 19 deaths. Atrophy and Debility, 55 deaths of young children. I consider these terms which are returned under one heading of disease vague, and ought to be avoided as much as possible in the certification of the cause of death. V.—CONVULSIVE DISEASES OF INFANTS (Under 5 years). Total deaths, 77. Death-rate per 1,000,1.44. Includes Hydrocephalus, Convulsions, and Teething. Hydrocephalus (Tubercular meningitis, water on the brain) was fatal to 26 children. There were 51 deaths from convulsions and teething, diseases which may be bracketted together, for frequently convulsions is only one of the symptoms of the latter. SANITARY WORK. It will be seen by referring to Table 6, Appendix, that a large number of sanitary improvements were carried out in the District, under the supervision of Inspectors Walters and Bond ; the owners, as a rule, being willing to abate the nuisances complained of, obeyed the orders issued by your Board. Legal Proceedings under the Sanitary Acts.—Some owners of property refused to comply with your order, therefore, 13 summonses were taken out against them, under the Nuisance Removal Acts. Convictions were obtained with costs in every case, and the magistrates ordered the necessary works to be carried out. Underground Dwellings.—Notices were served upon owners to close 11 rooms illegally occupied as underground sleeping places. Overcrowding.—14 rooms were found, on measurement, to be overcrowded, notices were therefore served upon the owners, who promptly reduced the number of inmates. The legal hours prescribed for inspecting premises, &c., being between 9 in the morning and 6 in the evening, the inspectors experience great difficulty in detecting overcrowding, because most of the inmates are away from their homes during these hours, and do not return until late at night. Our information is chiefly derived from anonymous correspondents. Slaughter Houses. — On the 26th October, the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Holborn Town Hall, granted Licences for Slaughter Houses to the following butchers, who had previously carried out the works ordered by your Sanitary Committee, and which works were supervised by your Surveyor:— 45 Slaughter Houses. Licencees.. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. Elan. Mr. Balch. 23, Store Street 11, Kenton Street 11, Marchmont Street Mr. Dunford. Mr. Edwards. Mr. Yernum. 36, do. Compton Mews. Mr. Philp. Cow-Houses.—Licences were also granted at the same time on similar conditions to the undermentioned cow-keepers:— (1). Mr. Rees Lewis, at No. 1, Coal Yard. Dimensions of cow-house, 23ft. x 17ft. x 15ft. =7140 cubic feet. 10 cows allowed. (2). Messrs. Bonner & Capper, at No. 56, Great Coram Street. Dimensions of cow-house, 29ft. x 16ft. x 8ft. = 3712 cubic feet. 6 cows allowed. (3). The same proprietors, at No. 19, Tavistock Mews. Dimensions of cow-house, 24ft. x 22ft. x 10ft. = 5280 cubic feet. 11 cows allowed. Dairies, Milkstores and Milkshops.—In pursuance of section 34 of the 41 & 42 Vict., ch. 74, the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, an Order in Council was made on the 9th July, 1879, regulatingthe business of dairies, cow-sheds and milkshops. By section 12, (1), "It is ordered that every Local Authority shall keep a register of persons from time to time carrying on in the district of the Local Authority, the trade of cow-keepers, dairymen, or purveyors of milk, and shall from time to time revise and correct the register." Accordingly 104 dairies, milkstores and milkshops, in St. Giles District, are registered by the Metropolitan Board of Works (the Local Authority). Bakehouses.—There being a difference of opinion between the Chief Inspector of Factories and myself, as to whether the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, by repealing the Bakehouse Regulation Act of 1863, takes their inspection and supervision out of the hands of the Local Sanitary Authorities, some correspondence followed, which resulted in my directing the Sanitary Inspectors to visit these places as heretofore. Common Lodging Houses.—In this District there are 63 Common Lodging Houses, registered under the Common Lodging Houses Acts of 1851 and 1853, to accommodate 2328 persons; the supervision of these houses is under the police; Sergeant Mallett, residing at Albany Street Police Station, being appointed for the district. For the list of houses, &c., vide Appendix, Table 9. Rag and Bone Shops.—The Inspectors have frequently visited these places and reported them to be kept in as fair a condition as the the nature of their business admitted. Inspection of Diseased Meat, &c.—The Streets and Markets were duly visited, especially on Saturday nights, for the purpose of 46 inspecting and examining any article of food exposed for sale and intended for the food of man. At different times quantities of rabbits, fish and fruit, chiefly belonging to costermongers, were taken to the stone yard and destroyed with the owners' consent. The decennial period 1870—80, shows an average mortality in the District of nearly 5.0 lower than the preceding decennial period, 1860—70. This is strong evidence that the sanitary improvements ordered by your Board have produced beneficial results. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS OF THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— During the year ending the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. John Hoyle, 296 samples of articles of food and drugs for analysis, consisting of milk, flour, bread, butter, cheese, tea, coffee, chicory, ale, porter, brandy, rum, whisky, gin, port wine, sherry, sweets, green peas, French beans, pickles, pepper, cayenne, mustard, lard, tobacco, cod liver oil, quinine, and seidlitz powders. Of these various samples, 22 were found to be adulterated, namely, 12 samples of milk, 6 of butter, 1 of mustard, 1 of whisky, and 2 of coffee. The samples have been very regularly collected throughout the year, usually about 6 every week, and the total number has been rather greater than usual, but the proportion of adulterated articles has been less than usual, being only 7.4 per cent., while last year it was 11 .7 per cent. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD. 17, Bloomsbury Square, 13 th June, 1881.
