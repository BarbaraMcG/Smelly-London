FRI 11 Friern Barnet Urban District Council. REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health, FOR THE YEAR 1914. BY FRANK A. SPREAT, F.R.C.S. Eng , D.P.H.. H.C.P S Member of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH LONDON. Roeerts & Newton, Printers, Tottenham Lane, Crouch End, N. 1914. to the CHAIRMAN and MEMBERS of the Frlern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1914, to which is attached the Report of Mr. Albert Harman, which again shows a good record of sanitary work done by him during the year. I have pleasure in expressing to the Members of the Council my appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and assistance during the past year. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Frank A. Spreat. For the convenience of the Local Government Board and those not well acquainted with the District, I repeat the following short description. The District of Friern Barnet is situated in the London area, and is bounded on the North by East Barnet, on the East by Southgate, on the South by Hornsey, and on the West by Finchley. It comprises 1,304 acres (including 152 acres occupied by the buildings and grounds of Colney Hatch Asylum) most of which is undulating ground, varying from 150 to 300 feet above the sea level, the geological formation being London clay, and here and there patches of gravel. , The General Character of the District.—For the purposes of representation, statistics, &c., it is divided into three Wards:—North, South and Central. 2 The North Ward (594 acres) is that part of the district north of Friary Road and the footpath from Friern Lane east to Lily Villas. The Central Ward (325 acres) comprises the middle part of the district North of Friern Barnet Road and west of the Great Northern Railway. The South Ward (233 acres) is the remaining portion of the district including the Site of the London County Asylum (Colney Hatch) 152 acres. The population is unevenly distributed. The North Ward is to a large extent land ripe for building purposes and the houses for the most part are of a higher rateable value being detached. The more Northern portion of the Ward is being developed. The houses in the Central Ward are chiefly semide tached and in terraces and streets. The Western portion of the Ward adjoining Finchley is being actively developed. The South Ward is the most thickly populated, the houses being of the six roomed type, and are inhabited in many cases by more than one family. Vital Statistics. The population is obtained by counting the number of tenements actually inhabited at the middle of the year 1914 as assessed in the rate books and multiplying this figure by the factor 5.4. The factor 5.4 is obtained by dividing the census population of the district by the number of inhabited assessments in the middle of the census year. The population in 1881 was 4,405, in 1891 6,716, and in 1901 was 11,566. Total population at all ages at Census of 1911: District, 12,185; Asylum, 2,740 14,925 Number of inhabited houses 2,765 Average number of persons per house 5.4 The following table gives the number of occupied and unoccupied houses, together with the estimated population for each Ward for this year: — 3 North. South. Central. Total. Houses occupied 584 1,217 1,023 2,824 „ unoccupied 15 100 43 158 Estimated Population 3,154 5,524 6,572 15,250 The population per acre in 1901 was approximately 8, in 1911 it was 8.9, and is now 11.7. Births. These numbered 403, giving a birthrate of 26.4, being an increase of 3.1. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 403— 128 = 275, the excess in 1908 being 213; in 1907, 177; in 1906, 152; in 1910, 240; in 1911, 169; in 1912. 239, and in 1913, 220. Deaths. There were 93 deaths (Tables I., III. and IV.) registered in the district, excluding the Asylum, giving a death-rate of 5.9. Thirty-eight deaths occurred outside the District of persons belonging to it, but 3 deaths occurred in the District of persons not belonging to it, giving; a net total of 93 + 38 — 3 = 128, showing a death-rate of 8.4. Deaths occurring under 1 year—28. Of this number 10 were due to premature birth and congenital defects. In spite of the hot, dry summer only 5 deaths were due to Diarrhoea and allied diseases. Three deaths were caused by some form of suffocation. Between 1 and under 2 years.—There were 9, 2 of these were due to Congenital Defects. Between 2 and under 5 years.—There were 5 deaths. Between 5 and 15 years.—There were 5 deaths. Between 15 and 25 years.—There were 2 deaths. Between 25 and 45 years.—There were 22 deaths. In this group Cancer claimed 4 deaths. Between 45 and 65 years.—There were 20 deaths. Cancer again claimed the highest with 3 deaths. Between 65 and upwards.—There were 37 deaths, this number being 29 per rent, of our total deaths, 4 Heart disease gave the highest number of deaths in this group, viz., 11. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under 1 year was 28, 9 more than in 1913, giving an infantile mortality rate of 69.7. an increase of 12.7 on 1913. This is due to the exceptionally high number, viz., 10, of premature births. The following is a table comparing the number of houses occupied and unoccupied, the population, births, birth-rate, deaths, and death-rate since 1885, giving an idea of the growth and health of the district since that year:— Year. houses. Population. Births. Birth-rate. Deaths. Death-rate. Occupied. Unoccupied. 1885 909 237 5269 157 29.7 66 12.5 1886 983 183 5496 207 37.6 68 12.3 1887 1022 106 5733 204 35.4 53 9.2 1888 1043 125 5900 207 34.8 71 11.8 1889 1076 86 6238 219 35.1 75 12.6 1890 1089 108 6507 258 39.6 94 14.4 1891 1117 84 6787 218 32.1 84 12.3 1892 1179 118 7079 191 26.9 70 11.2 1893 1216 72 7384 209 28.3 76 10.3 1894 1264 56 7467 206 27. 5 77 10.3 1895 1277 58 7698 204 26.5 77 10.0 1896 1377 19 8377 213 25.4 72 8.5 1897 1388 17 8355 228 27.2 104 12.4 1898 1441 8 8668 217 25.0 85 9.8 1899 1482 10 8916 236 26.5 99 11.1 1900 1564 57 9114 248 27.2 105 11.5 1901 1558 104 8816 242 27.4 99 11.2 1902 1633 143 9145 270 29.5 105 11.4 1903 1686 144 9442 294 31.1 96 10.4 1904 1714 160 9758 296 30.3 103 10.5 1905 1843 150 10470 291 27.7 104 9.2 1906 1863 192 10625 291 27.4 139 11.0 1907 1828 258 10237 294 28.9 117 11.4 1908 1863 235 10422 333 31.9 120 11.5 1909 1965 317 11005 316 29.0 121 11.0 1910 2075 328 11620 351 30.2 112 9.6 1911 2295 291 12394 307 24.5 138 11.2 1912 2372 341 12808 374 29.2 135 10.5 1913 2591 164 14258 333 23.3 113 7 .9 1914 2824 158 15250 403 26.4 128 8..4 5 The Principle Epidemic Diseases. The Zymotic death-rate was 0.39. There were no deaths from Smallpox. Measles, Scarlatina, Diphtheria or Whooping Cough, and only 6 from Diarrhoea. Considering the exceptionally hot and dry summer this number is very notable. The principal Epidemic Diseases Death-rate in previous years was: — 1884 2.1 1895 0.9 1906 1.5 1885 1.2 1896 1.5 1907 0.58 1886 2.7 1897 2.5 1908 0.47 1887 0.8 1898 1.9 1909 0.63 1888 1.5 1899 2.5 1910 0.6 1889 0.7 1900 0.5 1911 1.76 1890 1.6 1901 1.8 1912 1.17 1891 1.5 1902 1.4 1913 0.4 1892 1.0 1903 1.4 1914 0.39 1893 2.3 1904 1.1 1894 1.6 1905 1.0 Table of Infectious Diseases.

The following is the record of work done during the year by this much appreciated aid to diagnosis. Of the specimens submitted for examination 22 were swabbings from the Nose, Throat or Ear, 12 Sputa from suspected Phthisis, and two scrapings from suspectcd Ringworm. Of the 22 swabbings only 8 gave the Klebs I.oeffler Bacillus, one swabbing was examined especially on account of an obscure disease of the pharynx. Of the 12 specimens of Sputa two only shewed the Tubercle Bacillus. The examinations for Ringworm fungus gave negative results in both cases. The total number of examinations made was 36, against 40 for 1913 and 26 for 1912. No tests were made for the Widal reaction during the year. Scarlet Fever. 59 cases were notified as compared with 29 in 1013. 23 in 1912, 18 in 1911, and 14 in 1910. 49 cases 7 were treated in Hospital. All these cases were more or less sporadic in character—the disease was prevalent throughout the kingdom. Enteric Fever. There were not any cases. Puerperal Fever. There were not any cases. Erysipelas. There were 10 cases, 7 of which occurred in the Asylum. Infectious Diseases other than those Notifiable under the Act. Mumps. There were 56 cases. Whooping Cough. There were 9 cases. Measles. There were 13 cases. Chickenpox. There were 46 cases. Cancer. There were 11 deaths. Acute Anterior Polio Myelitis. There were not any. Cerebro Spinal Meningitis. There were not any. Opthalmia Neonatorum. Two notifications were received, both from medical men. 1914 is the 5th year of the systematic notification of diseases by School Teachers. The following notifications have been received from the Schools, excluding those re-notified under the Notification Act. DISEASES. School. Measles. Chickenpox. Mumps. Whooping Cough. Ringworm.

The number of Measles is again low. viz., 13, as compared with 20 in 1913 and 114 in 1912. There was also a decrease in the number of cases of Mumps, viz., 50, as compared with 71 in 1913. There was, however, an increase in Chicken-pox, for which St. Paul's School was mainly responsible. There was a sharp outbreak of Scarlet Fever in the Brunswick Park School necessitating closure for a period, and several Friern Barnet scholars attending this Hertfordshire School were affected. 9 Midwives Act. There are two Midwives living in the District. Isolation Hospitals. The District under an arrangement with the Southgate District Council, has six beds for the treatment of Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever. Fifty-one cases have been removed to Hospital during the year. Provision is made for Small-pox, the District having made arrangements with the Middlesex Joint Small-pox Hospital Board for beds at Clare Hall. Infectious Diseases and the Means taken to Prevent Their Spread. On receipt of information respecting an infectious case the premises are visited, a printed list of instructions as to necessary precautions is given and explained, disinfectants are supplied, and the schools attended in the case of children, and their employers in the case of adults, notified. Removal to an Isolation Hospital is offered, and when accepted, is carried out subject to beds being available. After recovery or removal of an infectious case disinfection of the room or rooms occupied is performed by means of formalin. Cleansing and stripping notices are served when necessary. Clothes, bedding, etc., are removed to Finchley, where they are put through the Defries Steam Disinfector. Diagnosis outfits and antitoxin are supplied free to medical men for use in cases occurring in the District, and the suspected specimens are examined and reported upon at the expense of the Council. Supplies of antitoxin are kept at the Council Chambers in the Central Ward, and at the residence of the Medical Officer of Health in the North Ward, and at that of the Sanitary Inspector. 10 Medical men have availed themselves of this serum, both for acute cases and as a preventative. On the receipt of notification of Infectious Disease among pupils of the Elementary Schools, a form giving full particulars of contacts is sent to the Chief Medical Inspector of Schools for the County, and copies of this form are also sent to the School Teacher, and the Attendance Officer, with a view to their exclusion. Common Lodging Houses. There are not any. Moveable Dwellings. No caravans have encamped in the district. Canals. There are none in the District. Meat and Food Inspections. The Sanitary Inspector has continued to give this matter attention, and the butchers' shops and general food vendors' premises are under periodical inspection. The meat sold in the district is chiefly derived from the Meat Markets of London. Pig Keeping. This industry has been under observation. Complaints have been received and reports have been made to the Council. Offensive Trades. There are not any. Dust Disposal and Removal. This is undertaken by the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The collection is made weekly, and the dust removed in covered vans. Notices are served as required to provide portable sanitary dust-bins in place of worn-out or unsanitary bins. 11 The refuse is chiefly taken to the Sewage Works and deposited on the ground. The provision of an up-todate Dust Destructor is before the Council, and the Committee have the matter under consideration. Ambulance. The District does not yet possess an Ambulance; arrangements have been made with the Finchley District Council for the hire of their conveyance. Mortuary. The Finchley District Council have a Mortuary a short distance from Friern Barnet's West boundary, and arrangements have been made for its use. Coroner's Inquests. The large room on the West side of the Council Offices has been fitted up for Coroner's Inquests, and during the year a number of Finchley and Friern Barnet Inquests have been held here. The Council Offices being near the Finchley Mortuary, this room has been found convenient for holding Finchley Inquests. Formerly the Inquests were held at public-houses. Legislation. The following Acts of Parliament, Bye-Laws, and Regulations are in force in your District:— Public Health Act, 1875. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. Public Healths Acts Amendment Act, 1890.

Situation of the Works.—The Sewage Works are situated on the South side of the District (in Wood Green Parish), and within 100 yards of a small brook, into which the effluent flows. The original works were completed at the end of 1886, from designs furnished by Mr. Baldwin Latham, M.I.C.E.. and were executed under his direction. The works have been extended by the Council from time to time under their Engineer and Surveyor and continue to produce a very satisfactory effluent. The method of treatment is as follows: The sewage, which enters the works by gravitation, is first passed through a revolving screen, after which a solution of Buxton lime equal to 4 grains per gallon is added, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. It then receives alumino-ferric to the extent of 1 grain per gallon, and is again well mixed by passing over a salmon ladder; and in this condition it flows into settling tanks, of which there are five, four having a capacity of 70,000 gallons, and the fifth which will hold 92,000 gallons. 13 The overflow from the tanks first passes out of the tanks into an open Channel, then into the first Contact Bed, and through the filter or second Bacteria Beds into an effluent chamber, and thence into the brook referred to above. The roads in this District have separate sewers for storm water, and all houses, except the older ones, have the dual system of drainage. An endeavour is being made to carry the storm water from the old houses into the surface water sewers as opportunities occur. This is very necessary as everything should be done to make the flow of sewage at any sewage works as uniform as possible. The sewage from the Avenue and Ely Place section of the District has to be pumped to the Sewage Works, and in this case any rain water admitted to the sewers greatly increases the cost of lifting the sewage to the gravitation sewers. Water Supply. The Barnet Water Company now gives a constant and good supply. The storage cisterns in the older sixroomed houses in the Avenue and Holly Park Districts are mostly situated outside the buildings and more or less exposed to the dirt and frost. Where possible, efforts are made to induce owners to fix a draw-off cock from the rising main, as well as maintaining the covers in good condition. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. These have been constantly inspected, and suggestion for the personal cleanliness of the milkers and the grooming of the cows have again been urged. A veterinary surgeon has not yet been appointed. Samples of milk were taken and found to comply with the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act. 14 Slaughter Houses. There is only one in the District, subject to an annual -licence. Public Elementary Schools. Disinfectants are supplied for use in the lavatories, and also to be added to the water with which the desks and floors are washed. During the vacations the schools are thoroughly disinfected. I would again urge the necessity of a supply of paper in the school W.C's by the Managers. Inspections. I have inspected Sydney Road, Doncaster Road, The Avenue, Holmesdale, Stanhope, St. Paul's, Cromwell. Bawtry Roads, Clarke's and Jacques' Cottages, Pembroke Road, all the mews and urinals, Holly Park Road, Bell Cottages, King's Parade, Colney Hatch Lane, Lever's Cottages, Smith's Cottages, Ely Place. Public Improvements. A Recreation Ground in the South Ward has been purchased. Lighting.—Additional lamps have been fixed and the lighting improved in many parts of the District. Allotments. The Council now possess Allotments in the North Ward on the Rathbone Estate and in the South Ward on the Sewage Farm. Housing. A considerable proportion of the smaller houses are six roomed, constructed and adapted for the use of one family. 15 In a large number of cases the houses (rented at 12 to 14 shillings per week) are occupied by more than one family. There have been few cases of overcrowding. A closing order has been made with regard to two wooden houses on the Great North Roau in 1913. It was not complied with and the Council made a demolition order. The owner appealed and the T.ocal Government Board held an enquiry and confirmed the order. Tuberculosis. The notification of all forms of Tuberculosis is now compulsory under the completed Regulations issued in 1912. During the year 69 notifications under the regulations have been received, of these 25 belong to the district, 4 were received in error from other districts and were transferred to the Medical Officer of Health to whom they should have been sent in the first place. Forty were received from Colney Hatch Asylum, and were also transferred to the Medical Officer of the district in which the person resided previous to admission into the Asylum. The notified cases are visited and particulars recorded. The following information has been supplied by the County Tuberculosis Officer, Dr. Dobson: — Friern Barnet patients: Treated in Sanatoria during 1914 7 Treated in Hospital during 1914 1 Supplied with shelter during 1914 1 Recommended for Sanatorium Treatment 1 The following are the Sanatoria and Hospitals useti by the above persons:—Clare Hall, South Mimms, Ventnor, Isle of Wight, Pinewood, Northwood, Brompton and Bournemouth. 16 Notification of Births Act, 1908. Forms or letters received 258 Total Births notified 262 Males 120 Females 117 Sex not stated 28 Still Births 2 Number of Births attended by Midwives 86 Visits requested 0 Visits by Voluntary Helpers 0 Visits by Sanitary Inspect 0 Numbers of Cards of Hints sent 256 In all cases where the mother is attended by a Midwife the notification forms are sent to the Chief Inspector under the Midwives Act, after the particulars are entered in the Register. There has been a slight increase in the percentage of Births notified as against the actual number of Births during the year. The figures are 1909 53 per cent. 1910 67 „ „ 1911 64 „ „ 1912 59.9 „ „ 1913 60„ „ The percentage of births notified by midwives has fallen from 41 to 19. The provision of the Act are becoming more widely known, and this falling off is due to the fact that the notifications are received more frequently from the parents than from Midwives. Schools. 1, All Saints; 2, St. John's; 3, Friern Lane; 4, St. Paul's; 5, St. Peter's; 6 and 7, Middlesex County Schools (Sydney Road and Holly Park). All these seven schools have been frequently inspected, and have been found to be in good order. During epidemics the schools are visited and lists of absentees obtained, whose homes are visited. 17 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole district during 1914 and Previous Years.

For years before 1911 some of the corrected rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number ot Inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. * In Column G are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of this number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. 18 + The Medical Officer of Health will be able from the returns made to him by the local Registrar of Deaths, as well as from the quarterly lists furnished by the Registrar-General, to till in Column 8 in accordance with the rule in the next paragraph below. The RegistrarGeneral, either directly or through the County Medical Officer of Health, will supply the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of deaths to be entered in Column 9; and all such deaths must be included in this Column, unless an error is detected, and its correction has been accepted by the Registrar-General. For Column 4 the Registrar-General will furnish to the Medical Officer of Health a Statement of the number of births needing to be added to or subtracted from the total supplied by the local Registrar. ‡ ''Transferable Deaths" are deaths ot persons who, having alixed or usual residence i n England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without lixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The Medical Officer of Health will state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of "non-residents" which are, to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of "residents" registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths: — (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district ot residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants Dorn and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district ot residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no lixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, it known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, it known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE Friern Barnet Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Report for the year ending December 31st, 1914, including a summary of the work -carried out, for the suppression of nuisances, the work in connection with the checking of the spread of infectious diseases, and the general administration of the Public Health and other Acts, so far as they relate to the office of Inspector of Nuisances. Complaints. These numbered 76 against 71 for 1913, an increase of 5, considering that the population of the district has increased from 16,798 to 18,093 this is satisfactory. Nuisances. 198 intimation notices were served, dealing with 624 nuisances; a classification of which will be found at the end of this report. As I have mentioned in previous reports, the nuisances arising from structural defects tend to decrease every year, as the older property in the district is constantly under inspection, and the owners have recognised that it pays them to keep the houses reasonably fit for occupation. 27 It has only been necessary to serve 8 statutory notices, and no proceedings before the magistrates have been necessary. Acting on the suggestions contained in the circular letter from the Local Government Board, special attention has been paid to the suppression of nuisances arising from accumulations, and the occupiers of tenement and other houses have been persuaded to burn as much of their house refuse as possible rather than place it in the dustbin. Nuisances from pig-keeping continue to arise from time to time, further piggeries have been erected on be eastern boundary of the district in the North Ward, but they are a considerable distance from houses, nevertheless being without proper drainage, and the sewage being treated by broad irrigation, complaints from flies and smells are bound to arise when the wind bloiws towards the houses. Slaughterhouses. There only remains one slaughterhouse in the dsitrict, viz., in the North Ward, it is frequently inspected and found to be little used, it is subject to an annual license. The occupier does not use the lairage; the animals being kept in the district of Finchley until wanted. Offensive Trades. There are no trades carried on in this district which can be defined as "offensive" within the meaning of the Public Health Acts. One fish-fryer has given up business, and the remaining two continue to keep their premises clean and free from nuisance by using good quality oil. The fish sold at these premises is frequently inspected and has been invariably found good and fresh. The proprietors have established a daily removal of fish offal, and no fish boxes are now stored on the premises; the empties being returned to the carrier in exchange for the full boxes the same day. 28 Food Supply. The food supply is entirely from the London markets and. with the exception of the small quantity killed at the slaughterhouse in the North Ward, the meat shows evidence of having been previously examined. I received one complaint of unsound fruit having been sold, but on investigation satisfied myself that the fruit although crushed somewhat, was quite sound and wnolesome. The number of food hawkers, not having shops in the district, has decreased, and the itinerant" Butter woman" has not been observed during the year; the seller of cheap pudding milk, too, has left the district. ♦ No complaints have been received re the milk supply,, and it has not been necessary to take informal samples. The milk supply has not been examined this year for Tubercle, pending the new legislation coming into force. The new Act is now on the statute book and will become operative in October, 1915, when our work that was optional will become obligatory. The milk supply is practically wholly derived from outside sources, there only being three cowsheds now in use within the district, with an average of 40 cows between them. The bakeries number six, two of which were underground. Two complaints were received from the Home Office Inspectors (which were remedied) relating to the non sweeping of floors. These complaints arise from the fact that the bakehouses are detached from the shops, and that in wet weather especially, dirt is carried in on the boots of the operatives when passing between shop and bakehouse. One underground bakehouse was infested with flies during the summer, and the occupier was warned to keep the place free from sweetstuffs, of which a considerable quantity was found exposed at the time of inspection. Housing. My previous remarks on this subject still hold good. The Council's scheme for the provision of houses in the South Ward is held up temporarily, by 29 the increased cost of building materials, and the difficulty of obtaining street-making material; and in time, no doubt, the houses will be erected. I have inspected the Council's cottages on the Rathbone Estate, and reported fully on the matter. The houses in the Avenue district have been greatly improved during the year. With regard to the two wooden houses on the Great North Road, the Council found it necessary to make a demolition order. The owner appealed to the Local Government Board, and an enquiry was held. The Board confirmed the demolition order, and the Council have taken the necessary steps to evict the tenants; up to the end of the year, however, the houses were still standing, and occupied by the same tenants as before the closing order was made. Two houses have been reported upon as being unfit for human habitation, a representation was not necessary, as in each case the owner has voluntarily closed the premises. The late very wet winter has caused many houses to become damp, and complaints have been received respecting them. The nuisance arises from the fact that solid brick walls will not keep out rain, and especially so when such walls are flank walls facing between N. and S. westerly. Even when the walls have been rendered in cement they are not damp-proof to a driving rain, and it would be well for the Council to make provision in the building bye-laws for such external walls to be constructed as "cavity walls." The nuisance is not confined to the old houses in the district, several houses only a few years old have been affected. Acting on suggestions from the Local Government Board, all the basement and semi-basement dwelling houses have been inspected, with a view to ascertaining to what extent these rooms have been used as sleeping places. 1 have reported fully on the matter, and it has heen decided not to make regulations at present, as the evil does not exist to any appreciable extent, and where such rooms are occupied, the Council can use their powers to make a closing order, should the necessity arise. 30 Petroleum Acts. There are three premises licensed for the sale of Petroleum to which the Act applies. These are frequently inspected, and have been found in order. (>n several occasions private motor car owners have consulted the Inspecting Officer of your Council as to the means they should adopt for the storage of motor spirit; generally speaking, there is no safer way to store spirit than to keep it in sealed tins placed in a covered iron tank situated well away from buildings; to make it a rule not to have more than one tin in use at one time, and to return all empties to the tank. Factories and Workshops. These remain about the same as last year, and information respecting them is contained on the sheets issued by the Home Office. No infectious disease has occurred in outworkers premises during the year. Public Lavatory and Urinals. This district is without proper public urinals, and there is a pressing need for them. I have reported this need several times and no substantial effort has been made to meet the difficulty. The only site available is now occupied by a horse trough and street refuge, neither of which are used to any extent. During the past ten years our population has nearly doubled, and we can no longer, with public decency, rely upon the licensed victuallers to provide urinal accomodation. Ambulance and Disinfections. The arrangements for the removal of patients, and for the steam disinfection of clothing and bedding are the same as they were 12 years ago. I have received every possible assistance from the Officers of the adjoining districts of Finchley and Southgate. Fortunately, we have had only a moderate number of cases of infectious disease during the year, but I must again emphasise the fact that should epidemic arise our present 31 ments would be quite inadequate to deal with it in an efficient manner. Clerical Work. Your Inspector continues to perform all the clerical work of the health department, and as the district grows so this work will increase. Two further registers have been added during the year. The following written communications were received: — 449 respecting Nuisances or their abatement. 490 respecting Infectious Disease. 77 respecting Notification of Tuberculosis. 282 respecting Notification of Births Act. 317 respecting other work not classified in the above. Total 1,615 In conclusion I wish to express my thanks for the support of the Public Health Committee and assistance rendered by fellow officers of the Council. I am. Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant.
