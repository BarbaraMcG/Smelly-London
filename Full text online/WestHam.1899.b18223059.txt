Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, "Every Medical Officer of Health appointed under order of the Local Government Board is required to make an annual report with regard to the district under his superintendence. The report is to be for the year ending 31st December. It should be chiefly concerned with the conditions affecting health in the district, and with the means for improving those conditions. It should comprise a summary of the action taken, or which he has advised the sanitary authority to take, during the year for preventing the spread of disease, and an account of the sanitary state of his district generally at the end of the year." In accordance with the above requisition, I beg to submit my annual report for the year 1899, and in doing so, desire to point out that such report must necessarily consist very largely of a summary of my periodical reports, and other matters which have been under discussion by the Council during the year, and which, therefore, are more or less within the immediate recollection of the members. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, CHARLES SANDERS, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. A 2 4 VITAL STATISTICS. Area and Population.—The area of the County Borough of West Ham is 4,706 acres. The Census population in the year 1891 was 204,902. The inhabited houses numbered 32,066. The number of persons per house were 6.3. The number of persons per acre were 43.5. At the middle of 1899 (the year under review) the population was estimated by the Registrar-General to be 300,241. For the purposes of these statistics I shall, as in former years, take a smaller figure, namely 286,500, while at the same time, for convenience of comparison, giving the rates calculated on the basis of the RegistrarGeneral's estimate in brackets after my own figures. As the Registrar-General's estimate is based upon the assumption that the ratio of increase of population during the inter-censal period 1881-1891 will be continued during the next 10 years, and my reduction of his estimate is based on an assumption that the increase recorded at the last Census has not been maintained, the correct vital rates will probably be found between the dual rates tabulated below. Births and Deaths.—The number of births registered during the year was 8,779, giving an annual birth-rate of 30 6 (29.7) per 1,000. This number was greater by 29 than the number of births registered in 1898, but only 16 in excess of the births in 1897, showing the stationary character of the birth-rate. The annual birth-rate of Registration London was 29.4 per 1,000. Distributed to their various Wards the births were as follows :- Stratford, 1,622 816 males 806 females Forest Gate, 1,640 823 males 817 females Plaistow, 2,994 1,521 males 1,473 females Canning Town, 2,523 1,315 males 1,208 females 5 The total deaths registered numbered 5,213, giving an annual death-rate of 19.5 (18.0) per 1,000. This death-rate is corrected for sex and population, the actual recorded rate being 18.3 (16.7). These deaths were 619 in excess of the number registered in 1898, and 727 in excess of those registered in 1897. In arriving at the total of 5,213 deaths, 303 deaths of West Ham inhabitants in public institutions in London have been included (Appendix, page 80), while 91 deaths occurring in West Ham in persons not belonging thereto have been deducted. The annual death-rate, 19.5, was higher than that recorded during the three previous years, but in this respect West Ham is not peculiar, as the year 1899 was in many of the larger towns remarkable for excessive mortality from Diphtheria and Diarrhœa. The death-rate of England and Wales was 18'3, while that for Registration London was 21.0. Taking in review the past 16 years and dividing it into two periods of eight years, 1884 to 1891 and 1892 to 1899, it will be found that the average death-rates of the two periods were 19.5 and 19.0 respectively. This shows a margin on the right side of only 0'5 per 1,000, no great sanitary advance, but not altogether unsatisfactory when it is remembered that the population has practically doubled itself since the year 1884 when there were certainly not more than 150,000 inhabitants. The deaths registered as occurring in the four Wards of the Borough are given in the table below Ward. Estimated Population. Deaths Registered Death-rate per 1,000. Stratford 57,900 768 13.2 Forest Gate 65,300 840 12.8 Plaistow 98,100 1,372 14.1 Canning Town 65,200 1,413 21.6 6 In considering the above death-rates it must be remembered firstly, that the estimated populations are even more unreliable than the general estimate for the whole Borough, and, secondly, that the rates are calculated upon the deaths actually occurring in the Wards which do not include deaths in Public Institutions. I believe that a larger percentage of deaths occurs in Canning Town and Forest Gate Wards than in Stratford and Plaistow, owing to the greater facilities obtaining in the latter districts of gaining the advantage of admission to such institutions as West Ham Hospital and Saint Mary's Children's Hospital, while the difficulties met with in gauging the population is shown by an examination of the new building returns. A few years ago Stratford was the chief scene of building operations, with a corresponding increase of population. Latterly the building activity has been largely localized in the Southern Wards, as may be seen by distributing the 1,426 new houses erected during 1899: New Buildings erected in 1899. Stratford 15 Forest Gate 109 Plaistow 966 Canning Town 336 1,426 One feels on firmer ground in dealing with the death-rates of the specially selected areas, the populations of which were obtained by personal canvass in 1897, and in which no building operations have introduced liability to error since that year. In the Table below, the deaths in Public Institutions, both inside and outside the Borough, have been, as far as possible, distributed to their appropriate areas, and as these latter include some of the oldest and worst districts in the Borough 7 one may safely conclude that the results obtained are an index of the health conditions of the poorer inhabitants generally:— District. 1897. 1898. 1899. No. of Deaths. Deathrate per 1,000. No. of Deaths. Deathrate per 1,000. No. of Deaths. Deathrate per 1,000. Woodgrange Area 11 5.0 20 8.5 32 13.9 Stratford Marsh Area 71 23.9 65 19.1 82 27.6 Bidder Street ,, 106 29.5 88 24.5 90 25.1 Croydon Road „ 147 22.6 144 22.1 128 19.9 Hallesville ,, 157 26.5 168 28.4 178 30.1 West Silvertown ,, 38 27.4 20 14.4 31 22.3 Mid-Silvertown ,, 36 14.7 49 20.0 47 19.2 East Silvertown ,, 44 23.2 36 19.0 50 26.4 Whole Borough 4,486 18.2 4,594 17.9 5,213 19.5 Deaths of Infants.—The deaths in children under one year of age numbered 1,770, or 201 for each 1,000 births. The average for the 33 large English Towns was 181, and of these the only towns with a greater death-roll in this respect during last year, were Manchester (206), Salford (209), Nottingham (210), Preston (255), Burnley (269). In viewing the five principal causes of deaths in infants, it will be at once seen that the chief factor in producing the above rate of 201 deaths to 1,000 births, which, indeed, is the highest rate yet recorded in West Ham, was Diarrhoea and Enteritis. Number of deaths under one year of age:— 1898. 1899. Diarrhoea and Enteritis 385 563 Premature Birth 164 154 Convulsions 175 133 Bronchitis 204 200 Marasmus, &c. 198 244 Many, one might say most, of the deaths from the above causes are essentially preventible, being due to ignorance rather than 8 unavoidable disease. At the end of the year, with the object of taking active steps towards the education and improvement of the wives and daughters of the poorer households where these diseases are particularly rampant, the Council, on the initiative of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, decided to appoint two Women Health Visitors, whose duties should be the same as are performed by the Health Visitors of Birmingham, and are here set out:— Duties of Health Visitors. To visit from house to house in such localities as the Medical Officer of Health shall direct. To carry with them disinfectant powder and use it where required. To direct the attention of those they visit to the evils of bad smells, want of fresh air, and dirty conditions of all kinds. To give hints to mothers on the feeding and clothing of their children, and use their influence to induce them to send their children regularly to school. In cases of sickness, to assist in promoting the comfort of the invalid by advice and personal help. To urge, on all possible occasions, the importance of cleanliness, thrift, and temperance. They must note— 1. The general sanitary condition of the house. (a) The number of rooms and of occupants. (b) The existence of bad smells, and whether they arise from deficient ventilation, from bad drainage or from accumulations of filth. 9 (c) The state of the walls and floors, whether dirty, from the tenant's or the landlord's neglect, or in need of repair. The general mode of living, particularly with regard to personal and general cleanliness. 3. The feeding and clothing of children, especially of those under two years old. Whether the baby is nursed by the mother or fed by hand ; if the latter, what it is fed upon. 4. Any cases of illness in the house— (а) Nature of the disease. If contagious, enquire when and how contracted. (б) Whether there is a medical man in attendance. (c) How far the necessary sanitary precautions are being carried out. Chief Zymotic Diseases.—The seven principal zymotic diseases caused 1,288 deaths during the year, equivalent to an annual zymotic death-rate of 4 4 (3.5) per 1,000. If the figure 4'4 be correct then the zymotic death-rate last year was higher than that of any of the 33 large towns. If the RegistrarGekeral's figure be taken it reduces West Ham from such an unenviable supremacy to a position below eight other towns. I have elsewhere discuiteed the zymotic death-rate and shown how its value is reduced by dual effect of differences in the method of certifying among practitioners and differences in the method of tabulation among Medical Officers of Health; so that while any particular method, persisted in for a number of years in a district, may render the zymotic death-rate useful for purposes of comparison in that district, it is 10 practically worthless as a standard for comparison with other districts or with the country generally. For instance, the difference between my death-rate and that of the Registrar-General arises not only from a different estimate of population, but also from the fact that while he records 465 deaths from Diarrhoea during the year in West Ham, I have tabulated 730 deaths as being of sufficiently suspicious character to warrant their being included under the head of Epidemic Diarrhoea. Small-pox.—Only two cases of Small-pox occurred during the year. These were a husband and wife living in Croydon Road, who contracted their illness in February, by visiting a friend at Buckhurst Hill, while he was suffering from the disease, he having recently arrived from Marseilles, where he in all probability acquired the contagion. The West Ham cases were removed to the Hospital Ships of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and returned home well in due course. Owing to the subsequent completion of our own Dagenham Small-pox Hospital, these were probably the last cases that we shall need to send to the Hospital Ships for many years. At the same time, it is fitting to record that the agreement entered into by the Town Clerk in 1894, on behalf of the Council, with the Metropolitan Asylums Board, by which the latter body undertook to receive our cases for reasonable consideration, pending the erection of our own hospital, proved to be of the greatest value to the Borough. Altogether, during the period from April, 1894, to February 25th, 1899, 323 cases were sent to the Ships of the Board, of whom 23 died. The total cost to the Borough was £3,276 19s. 4d , say £10 each case ; but the value of prompt removal is scarcely reducible to the figures of a money column, and although the Small-pox Committee of the Board frankly admitted at the time that in adopting the proposed course, they were more concerned in protecting London than in conferring benefits upon West Ham, the fact remains that the Borough did obtain, both in the feeling of- security from, and in the administrative control of, the virulent contagion of Small-pox, considerable benefit by the arrangement above mentioned. 11 12 Scarlatina.-Of recent years there has been a marked decline in the epidemic prevalence of Scarlatina, and also in the virulence of the poison produced during the course of the disease, though in the latter respect the decline has shown a slight check during the past year. 787 cases occurred, causing 18 deaths, equivalent to an attackrate of 2.46 per 1,000 population, a death-rate of .06 per 1,000, and a case-mortality of 2.1 per cent. of persons attacked. The distribution of the cases through the Borough was as follows:—Stratford, 125; Forest Gate, 177; Plaistow, 334; Canning Town, 151. Of these only 173 could be received into the Plaistow Hospital. Measles and Whooping-cough.—Usually these diseases are associated together in epidemic form, but during 1899 their incidence was exceptional. Measles was epidemic in February and March, and again prevalent in October, it caused 202 deaths, making a death-rate of .70 per 1,000, a rate above the average of the last ten years in West Ham, and one which was exceeded by only three of the large towns. On the other hand, Whooping-cough caused 94 deaths, equivalent to a death-rate of .32 per 1,000, which was considerably below the average for the last ten years. Neither of these diseases lend themselves, in my opinion, to profitable seclusion in hospital to the same extent as is the case with the usually notifiable diseases ; their prevention must be sought rather in the gradual education of the masses as to the fatal character these diseases exhibit, the fact that death is commonly caused by complications arising from ignorance or carelessness, and the necessity for discarding the very popular notion that Measles and Whooping-cough are inevitable accompaniments of youth, of a character barely dissimilar from dentition. Epidemics of Measles are mostly sudden in their onset and soon produce a marked falling oft' in the attendances at one or more schools, a fact generally brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health, thereby enabling the Sanitary Authority to consider, among other measures, the desirability of school closure as a means for preventing the spread of the disease. This measure is of such a drastic character that the most serious consideration should be given to it before enforcing a course so calculated to interfere with education. There is, 13 however, a growing mass of evidence tending to show that the closure of Infants' Departments, while not so seriously affecting the work of the schools has a decidedly beneficial effect in controlling the disease. This course was adopted in October at the outset of an epidemic of Measles in Stratford New Town in connection with St. Paul's Church Schools. In this case the Infants' Department, which was carried on in a building removed a considerable distance from the main school serving boys and girls, and recruited from areas sufficiently separated to warrant the conclusion that the scholars did not mix to any great extent outside school times, was closed for three weeks, with, I believe, the result that the extent of the disease in that part of the Borough was materially checked. Diphtheria.—Last year was so marked by an undue prevalence of Diphtheria, that in the Autumn I was instructed to report upon the subject in association with the general zymotic death-rate of the Borough. My report is reproduced in the Appendix, and I can add little here, except to bring the statistics up to date, and take a general review of the course of the disease throughout the whole year. The monthly notified cases and deaths distributed to the four Wards are shown in the Table below:— Diphtheria Notified Cases and Deaths. Month. Stratford. Forest Gate. Plaistow. Canning Town. Cases. Deaths. Cases. Deaths. Cases. Deaths. Cases. Deaths. January 8 1 57 5 68 9 43 7 February 6 2 30 7 43 9 27 6 March 10 — 30 4 31 3 11 1 April 15 3 24 3 31 3 18 1 May 22 6 24 3 27 2 13 4 June 29 6 30 3 34 2 12 2 July 26 7 31 3 39 1 26 1 August 13 7 16 2 29 4 22 7 September 16 1 25 3 27 2 17 1 October 9 1 23 1 19 4 59 6 November 7 3 28 3 19 2 76 15 December 5 4 15 3 20 2 46 6 * In the above Table, Deaths in Institutions have been distributed to the Wards from which they were removed. 14 The total number of cases notified was 1,256, which exceeded by 287 the number notified in the year 1898. This is equal to an attack rate of 4.3 per 1,000 of the population. Fortunately the death-rate has not kept pace with the attack rate. The total deaths numbered 181, equal to a death-rate of .63 per 1,000 and a mortality of 14.4 per cent. of persons attacked—the lowest mortality yet recorded. In 1891 the case mortality was 30 per cent., which means that if the same rate of deaths to attacks recorded in that year had occurred last year, instead of 181 deaths, we should have suffered from this one disease 376 deaths. In considering the distribution of the disease, it is essential to take note of the milk supply, and also of the incidence of the disease on the schools of the Borough. Indeed, both these points are care fully watched from day to day as a matter of official routine, but it will also be useful to place on record the results of the year in this respect, and I therefore give below the number of cases of Diphtheria in the Northern and Southern Divisions of the Borough, distributed to each milk seller whose name has been given as supplying milk to each case. In the Northern Division one milkman was associated with 29 cases, another with 27, others each with 20, 15, 14, 13 (twice), 11 (twice), and 10 cases respectively. Forty-one were each associated with less than 10 cases, while in 52 cases condensed milk was used by the family. In the Southern Division one milkman was associated with 40 cases, another with 26, others each with 15 (twice), 12, 11. Sixty-four were each associated with less than 8 cases, while in 123 cases condensed milk was used by the family. Total Number of cases of which particulars were obtainable. No. of Milksellers engaged. No. of Cases using Condensed Milk. 726 121 175 With regard to the school incidence, I give below the number of certificates sent to the Head Teachers of the various Public Elementary 15 Schools stating that Diphtheria had attacked the home of a scholar. I have not included private schools and Sunday schools, as the figures for each are generally so small as to he negligible, though the number of such schools notified exceeded that of the Board Schools. It must be noted that the numerals opposite each school do not represent the actual number of scholars attacked, though frequently very near that number, and also that the total of each Ward bears no relation to the number of cases notified in the Ward.

As I have elsewhere stated, one authority views school association as the supreme law in this matter, while another, without denying the dangers attending on close contact in schools, considers it to have little effect in producing epidemic prevalence. Damp in and around dwellings, variations in sub-soil water, drainage and other sanitary defects, atmospheric conditions—all have their champions and their traducers, and all, doubtless, aid in the spread of the disease, but the essential factor giving rise to the protean character which Diphtheria exhibits, both in localized areas and throughout the country, is not to be found in any one of these so-called causes. Bacteriological science has yet to write the life history of the Klets-Löffler bacillus, but in the meantime a patient collection of facts may lead to useful generalizations. The figures given above show, even in our own district, some of the difficulties to be met with in studying the distribution of Diphtheria and are more clearly portrayed in the accompanying chart, in which the seasonal curves of Diphtheria cases in the four Wards is compared with that of the whole Borough. The high rise in Canning Town Ward during November may be explained by a severe epidemic associated with school infection in the Custom House district, but school infection will not wholly explain the differences observable in the Wards at the beginning of the year. On the other hand it is idle to allege sanitary defects as of paramount importance when one remembers the number of houses affected around the Park School, a new district, substantially built, and one in which sanitary defects are comparatively infrequent. I have not yet been able to compare our seasonal curve with that of England and Wales, but in comparing West Ham with other large towns one finds that Diphtheria prevalence last year was to some of them a matter of yet more serious moment, as shown by the following Diphtheria death-rates:—West Ham .63. Portsmouth .64, Leeds .78, Leicester 1.06, Sheffield 1.28, Swansea 1.36. 17 MONTHLY NOTIFICATIONS Of DIPHTHERIA IN THE 4WARD5 COMPARED WITH THE CURVE OF THE WHOLE BOROUGH. 18 Out of the total 1,256 cases notified during the year, only 315 could be received into the Plaistow Hospital. It is obvious that, while greatly benefiting the 315 patients admitted and their friends, the removal of such a small proportion of cases can have had little effect in checking the spread of the disease. Epidemic Diarrhoea.—As is universally the case, the deaths from Epidemic Diarrhoea were chiefly in young infants, and this must be explained chiefly by the faulty methods of feeding. It has been shown that the deaths from Diarrhoea in young infants under three months of age are 15 times as great among those brought up by hand as they are among babies nursed at the breast. It is this disease, too, which is responsible for increasing the general infantile mortality. Last year the total number of children under 1 year who died from all causes numbered 1,770, equal to 201 deaths for each 1,000 births, the largest infantile death-rate I have yet had to record. During the year 730 persons died of Diarrhoea, giving a deathrate of 2 5 per 1,000. 701 of these deaths were in children under the age of 5 years. I have elsewhere explained that if the RegistrarGeneral's system of tabulating Diarrhoea, and his estimate of the population be accepted, the gross number of deaths from this disease will be reduced to 465, giving an annual death-rate of 1.55 per 1,000. On these figures, the West Ham Diarrhoea death-rate last year was exceeded by Brighton (1.56), Portsmouth (1.76), Birmingham (1.67), Nottingham (1.68), Liverpool (1.87), Boltom (l.64), Manchester (1.83), Salford (1.97), Burnley (1.79), Preston (2.30), Sheffield (1.58). Enteric Fever.—The predisposing causes of Enteric Fever are similar in character to those of Diarrhoea, and although dependent upon a different micro-organism, it is not surprising that an outbreak of the one disease frequently precedes the other. 19 The Autumn of 1898 was noted tor epidemic prevalence of Enteric Fever throughout the country, and I showed in my last Annual Report that the West Ham prevalence varied directly with that of London. The epidemic died down in the opening months of 1899, but suffered a recrudescence in the Autumn months of September to November. Altogether 467 cases were notified, of which 83 were fatal, or nine more than in the previous year. The attack rate was therefore T6 per 1,000, the death-rate .28 (.26) per 1,000, and the case mortality 17 per cent. of cases. Although this mortality is slightly greater than in the previous year it is below the average I have recorded during the past 10 years. Increasing evidence is being furnished of the liability to contract this disease suffered by persons eating contaminated oysters and other shell fish. The Brighton Corporation are moving in this matter with a view to inducing the Government to institute special legislation, and your Council decided to support the memorial prepared by the Brighton Authorities for that purpose. I have instructed the Inspectors of Nuisances, in making their enquiries in connection with this disease, to pay especial attention to the food supply of the individual suffering, but, hitherto, their reports have not given many instances of cases in which the origin of the disease could be traced to oysters from suspicious layings. As an instance of the need for the Plaistow Hospital extension, which is now being pushed forward, and of the practical impossibility of treating this disease in the homes of the poor, I cite the following series of cases:— No. 1.—E. W., aged 22, 112, Clarence Road. Attacked with Enteric Fever 21st September. Notified 9th October. Nursed at home by wife. No. 2.—A. W., aged 21, 112, Clarence Road, Wife of No. 1. Attacked 13th November. Notified 15th November. Removed to Charing Cross Hospital. B 2 20 No. 3.—R. W., aged 50, 112, Clarence Road, Mother of No. 1. Attacked 16th November. Notified 25th November. Removed to Medical Mission Hospital. Died 20th December. No. 4.—F. W., aged 28, 16, Stephenson Street, Brother of No. 1. Attacked 16th November. Notified 24th November. Assisted to nurse No. 1. Removed to Union, where he died. No. 5.—H. W., aged 21, 12, Ernest Road, Brother of Nos.. 1 and 4, whom he visited and assisted. Attacked 4th December. Notified 11th December. Having regard to the length of time between the onset of cases Nos. 1 and 2, it is extremely probable that had the Plaistow Hospital been available for the prompt removal of case No. 1 the other four cases (including two deaths) would not have occurred. Localized Zymotic Death-rates Below I give for the last three years the Zymotic Death-rates of the specially selected worst areas of the Borough, calculated upon the population ascertained in 1897:— Area.

The salient features of the year were as follows The mean temperature of the year was 50.6°, being 1.9° above the average of the last 128 years. The longest spell of hot weather occurred between the middle of July and the end of August, when the mean temperature continued considerably above the average of the past 50 years. The month of November, too, was unusually warm. The hottest day was August 15th, when the temperature rose to 90.0°, and the coldest day was December 16th, when it fell to 19.3°.

With this end in view it is intended to hold a Congress in London in 1901, and a preliminary Meeting has already been held, attended by representatives from most of the large towns in the country, Medical Officers of Health, and others interested in the subject. I have already submitted to the Council a reprint on the salient features of the general problems connected with the disease, and therefore need only briefly call attention to the special points of practical use in West Ham. Although the Phthisis death-roll has improved considerably during the last 45 years, it is still responsible for by far the heaviest disease mortality in the country. It might have been anticipated that West Ham, a working class town, densely populated, whose inhabitants are mostly employed in factories and at indoor occupations, would have a high Phthisis death rate. This is not so, the death-rate being lower than that of England and Wales; and, in comparison with London, there are very few, even of the healthiest districts, with a lower Phthisis death-rate than West Ham. This may be judged by the table of grouped districts below. Phthisis death-rate per 1,000 living during 1890. West Ham 1.21 West London 1.65 North „ 1.64 Central „ 2.75 East „ 2.19 South ,, 1.74 24 It was shown before the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis (the second Royal Commission in recent years on this subject) that during the past 45 years, the mortality from Tubercular diseases of all kinds had been reduced 39 per cent., and the mortality from Phthisis (that form of the disease associated with tubercle in the lungs) had been reduced 45 per cent. On the other hand, in deaths from Tabes Mesenterica (the form of the disease associated with glandular swelling in the abdomen), the reduction had only amounted to 8 per cent., while in infants under one year the deaths from this form of the disease had actually increased. Having regard to the now wellestablished fact of the susceptibility of domestic animals, and especially milch cows, to Tubercle, and to the possibility of infection being conveyed to the human subject by means of tuberculous meat or milk, it may be fairly assumed that the phthisical reduction above referred to, is due very largely to the general improvement in the sanitary surroundings of the population, and the increased mortality among infants is due chiefly to the growing practice of bringing children up upon cows' milk, in association with, or to the exclusion of the mother's breast. The preventive measures calculated, to a Sanitary Authority, in reducing the mortality from Phthisis may be considered under four heads:— 1. Prevention of sale of Tuberculous milk and meat. 2. Notification, compulsory or voluntary. 3. Visitation, with the object of imparting practical knowledge, and gaining information of defective conditions. 4. Disinfection after death, removal or recovery. 1.—Prohibition of Sale of Tuberculous Milk.— Paragraph No. 14 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis reads as follows:— "14. We recommend that where cows housed in one district supply milk to another district, the Local Authority of 25 the district in which the cows are housed shall be bound, when required, to supply to the Local Authority of the district in which the milk is sold or consumed full information and veterinary reports regarding the condition of the cows, byres, etc., whence the milk is drawn. Where the Local Authority of one district are dissatisfied with the reports so obtained, they may apply to the Local Government Board, with a view to an independent inspection and report being made." The Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1899, provides that milk from cows, certified by a Veterinary Surgeon to be suffering from Tubercular disease of the udder, shall not be mixed with other milk, and shall not be sold or used for human food. To consistently carry out this Order it is necessary that the cows should be examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether they suffer from udder disease, and also that the supply of milk should be periodically examined for the presence of the Tubercle Bacillus. Both these measures were adopted by the London County Council at the end of last year, and I give below the summary of results found by the Veterinary Surgeon whom they engaged for the purpose of examining into the condition of the cows in London cowsheds:— "In all, 5,144 cows were inspected, and of these 4,464 were found to be free from disease or abnormalities of the udder." 26 The following table shows the classification of the remaining 680 cows :— Clinically affected with tubercular disease of the udder. Suspected cases of tuberculardisease of the udder. Subjects of acute martitis. Affected with chronic indurations of udder. Giving evidence of atrophy of one or more quarters. Injuries, deformities, superficial abscesses, simple eruptions, strictures, and obliterations of milk ducts Hypertrophied udders without induration. Giving milk of poor quality but owing to natural causes, commonly known as dried-off cows. Recovered or removed from premises during the period between the visit of the Assistant and the Veterinary Surgeon. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 7 5 82 165 214 38 20 112 37 27 It might be thought that Tubercular disease would be more common in town cowsheds than in those of the country districts, but this is not so. Indeed, it has been shown in the case of Liverpool, that Tubercule was found twice as often in samples of milk coming from the country, as in samples from the town. As a result of the special examination above detailed, the London County Council approached the Sanitary Authorities of the Home Counties with the request " whether, if examination should show that milk sent to London from your district is Tuberculous, your Council would be willing to supply the London County Council with information and veterinary reports respecting the condition of the cows, byres, etc., whence such milk is drawn." This question your Council answered in the affirmative, thereby voluntarily adopting the course which would become compulsory should legislation follow the recommendations of Paragraph 14 of the Report of the Royal Commission. In the interests of Public Health, however, I am of opinion that the Council would be wise to adopt more active measures, on the lines of the London County Council. I propose, with the Council's permission, to take periodical samples for submission to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine, both of our own supply and of that which comes from the country. In addition, I recommend the Council to arrange with the Veterinary Inspector to inspect quarterly the cows of the Borough with a view to ascertaining the presence of Tubercular disease of the udder. The cost of this would be small indeed when compared with the advantages to be obtained. The Royal Commission found that " The milk from cows with Tuberculosis of the udder possesses a virulence which can only be described as extraordinary," and as it ispatent that the milk of the cows in our district is chiefly distributed to our own population, each focus of infection discovered will be fraught with direct sanitary gain. In this connection another preventive measure may be considered, namely, the "sterilization" of our own milk supply. The Council is now supplying the Plaistow Hospital, and will doubtless supply the 28 Asylum, with milk from Rookery Farm, so that it would be well for your Public Health Committee to again discuss the advisability of fitting up a sterilizing plant in association with the farm supply, not only as a means of perfecting that consumed in their own institutions, but also as a means of developing a town distribution, with the object of decreasing both the infantile and Diarrhoea death-rates. I suggest that they at least visit one or more dairies in London where the sterilization process may be seen in operation. 2.—Notification, compulsory or voluntary.—Strong arguments can be advanced for and against compulsory notification. The long course usually taken by the disease, the fact that patients suffering are for the greater part of that period able to get about and attend to their business; the fact that they thus have probably been spreading the Tubercle Bacillus broadcast before the disease is recognized, the fear that sufferers, able to get about, would be subject to a system of espionage—these are some of the reasons advanced against compulsory notification. Up to the present, too, I believe the Local Government Board have opposed the application of notification to this disease, and there docs not appear to be any immediate likelihood of obtaining such powers. On the other hand, if systematic action is to be taken against Phthisis, it surely is of the first importance that every possible case should be known to the Local Authority. With the exception of the lengthy course, all the other arguments are equally applicable to and were advanced against the adoption of notification of other infectious diseases, yet no one now doubts the value of their compulsory notification to the public health service. While, however, I do not advise the Council to seek powers of compulsion at present, I am certainly of opinion that advantage would be gained by paying the usual fees for voluntary notification. In this way the Medical Officer of Health would hear of many cases from the Board of Guardians, Hospitals, and other Institutions, probably the very cases most needing definite instructions as to the precautions to be adopted to avoid spreading the disease, and most likely to benefit 20 by the improvement in their home surroundings as a result of a sanitary official's visit. This voluntary system of notification has been some time in operation in Brighton, and I should welcome it in West Ham. The total deaths from Phthisis in the Borough average under 400 each year, so that if every one were previously notified at a cost of 2/6 each the total cost would not be £50 per annum. 3.—Visitation.—Every known case of Phthisis should be visited with the object of examining into the sanitary conditions under which the sufferer lives, and it is also customary to leave printed instructions, briefly epitomising the precautions requisite for preventing the spread of the disease. The leaflet which I have drawn up for distribution in West Ham is given below. HOW TO PREVENT CONSUMPTION. Consumption is an infectious disease caused by a tiny seed, germ, or microbe (called the Tubercle Bacillus) passing from a Consumptive person or animal into another person or animal, whose body is in what is called a "receptive condition," that is to say, in such a condition that the microbe is enabled to grow, multiply, and give rise to the illness or death of the receiver. There are many forms of Consumption, but Consumption of the lungs, often called Phthisis, or Pulmonary Tuberculosis, is by far the most common form. It kills one person out of every ten that die in England, and one out of every eleven that die in West Ham. Nearly 70,000 persons die every year in Great Britain from Tuberculosis. The seed of Consumption may be taken into the system in food (meat or milk), but the usual method of "catching it" is by inhaling or breathing infected dust. The expectoration (phlegm or spit) of a Consumptive person contains thousands of seeds (Bacilli); while the spit remains wet the seeds remain in it; but when the spit becomes dry the seeds (or germs) are blown about in the form of dust, Hence everyone must, at times, be exposed to the risk of infection. 30 The popular belief that Consumption is hereditary is only partially true. What is sometimes hereditary, is the "receptive condition," which enables the germ to grow; but this receptive condition, 01 "predisposition to consumption," is more frequently acquired or brought on through intemperance, overcrowding, bad air, darkness, dampness, dusty occupations, colds, sore throats, debility following infectious diseases, or, in fact, any illness producing weakness of the constitution. Therefore, good health, regular habits, sunlight, and fresh air are the best protection against the disease. Consumption may be Prevented, and in many cases Cured, by carrying out the following Rules :— 1. All sleeping and living rooms (including schools and shops) should be well lighted and ventilated, and kept free from dirt and continuous dampness. 2. During the day all windows should be kept as wide open as possible and slightly so during the night. Chimneys should not be blocked up. 3. Avoid overcrowding, either of persons in a room or of families in a house. A bedroom 10 feet each way contains scarcely air space enough for 3 persons over 10 years old, or 2 persons over 10 and 2 children under 10 years. 4. All rooms, passages and stairs should be kept clean. Use wet dusters, and in sweeping floors use, if possible, damp sawdust or tea leaves—then boil the dusters and burn the sawdust or tea leaves. 5. Milk, if not " sterilized," should be boiled, and meat be well cooked. 6. When a room has become disused, owing to the removal or death of a comsumptive person, such room should be 31 thoroughly disinfected. This will be done free of cost on application to the Medical Officer of Health at the Town Hall, Stratford. The walls should be afterwards stripped of paper and the paper burnt, the floors and woodwork cleansed with soap and water, and all soiled linen and clothing boiled. Special Rules for Consumptive persons :— 7. A consumptive person should not swallow his own tion (phlegm or spit). 8. No person, consumptive or otherwise, should spit about the house, in cabs, omnibuses, tramcars, railway carriages, or in public places such as theatres, concerts, meetings, churches, schools, or upon the footways. 9. Indoors a consumptive person should spit into a special cup or vessel containing a little water and disinfectant, or into pieces of paper or rag which should be immediately burnt. If pocket handkerchiefs are used they must be put into boiling water before they have time to dry. Therefore, quite apart from the number of handkerchiefs required, the special cup saves much time and trouble. 10. Out-of-doors a consumptive person should spit into a special pocket spittoon, which may be obtained from any chemist. 11. The collected expectoration should be mixed with an equal quantity of strong disinfectant before being passed down the w.c., and the cup or pocket spittoon immediately washed out in boiling water with strong disinfectant. 12. All cups, spoons, forks, or other articles used by consumptive persons should be carefully washed before being used by others, and the remains of food left by a consumptive should not be used by the healthy. 32 13. A consumptive person should occupy a separate bed, and should not kiss or be kissed upon the lips, but upon the cheek or forehead. 14. No consumptive mother should give suck. 15. Sunlight and fresh air are the greatest enemies of infection, and the best treatment is the open air treatment. A consumptive person need not fear going out in any weather, if warmly clad. 16. Inflate the lungs well, and always breathe through the nose. The breath and perspiration of a consumptive person are not infectious. If the above rules are carefully attended to, there is no danger to the healthy in the ordinary intercourse of social and family life. 4.—Disinfection.-—It is highly desirable that the premises occupied by a consumptive person should be disinfected on recovery, removal, or death, and I am adopting that course so far as is possible. Unfortunately, I do not learn of a case until sometimes a week has elapsed after death, when the room has been cleansed and put to other uses, and the occupants are indisposed to submit to the ordeal of "turning the place upside down." This offers another argument in favour of voluntary notification, as one would be able to disinfect both more frequently and earlier. In the cases of the notifiable diseases, it is no uncommon thing for the Inspectors of Nuisances to learn of the death of a case, and indeed, for the room to be disinfected, before the death is returned to me. I may have occasion at a future time to approach the Council upon the subject of the open-air treatment of Phthisis, but do not think the present an opportune moment to discuss the subject. Plague.—The spread of this disease during last year to Western Europe and to the Thames created some uneasiness to Port 33 Sanitary Authorities and their adjoining districts. At the request of Dr. Reece of the Local Government Board, who visited West Ham on November 6th, I arranged for a house-to-house visitation of the dock district to find out the houses where seamen are, or are likely to be, taken in as lodgers or permanent residents. I also sent the following circular letter to every medical man practising in the district:— Public Health Department, Town Hall, West Ham, November, 1899. My Dear Sir, Plague in Portuguese Ports. You are aware that there is a very considerable trade between London and Portugal, and at the present time the vessels, and those on board, are submitted to a careful inspection by the Medical Officer of Health to the Port of London. The names and addresses of those arriving from Portuguese Ports are taken, and the name of any person coming into West Ham from a suspicious source is sent on to me and subsequently visited by the staff of this department. As the incubation of Plague is estimated by the Venice Convention to be from five to ten days, and the duration of the voyage from Oporto is only four days, it is quite possible for persons to land in an incubative stage. It is therefore desirable that special attention should be paid to sea-faring persons coming under your notice in the early stages of illness, and if at any time you can give me information of any suspicious illness in a person of this class I shall be extremely obliged ; while, on the other hand, if I can give you any information concerning any sea-faring persons whose name, or names, have been sent to me, I shall be glad to do so. I am, Yours very faithfully, CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health. 34 Hospital Isolation.—During the year 506 cases were received into the 72 beds at present available for infectious disease at the Plaistow Hospital; 18 of these (13 Diphtheria and 5 Scarlatina) were residents of East Ham. The West Ham cases consisted of 173 Scarlatina patients and 315 Diphtheria. The extension of the hospital is now proceeding rapidly. In February the Council considered the following tenders for executing the work:— £ Wm. Gregar & Son 111,300 Foster & Dicksee 114,983 A. E. Symes 101,000 J. Shillitoe & Son 98,000 J. Chessum & Son (subject to conditions) 91,278 but decided to do the work by its own Works Department, which course is now being successfully carried out, the original design of the administrative block having been amended by the addition of another central storey, at an estimated cost of £1,000, for the purpose of providing eight additional bedrooms for a corresponding increase of the staff. The Mayor (Alderman M. Adamson) turned the first sod in connection with the Extension on 24th August, and laid the foundation stone of the new buildings on 26th October. The Dagenham Hospital (50 beds) for Small-pox was finally completed and formally opened for the reception of cases on 25th March, 1899. It will be remembered that in connection with this hospital a seven years' agreement is running between the Council and eight other Local Authorities by which the Council undertakes to admit into Dagenham Hospital all cases of Small-pox occurring in those localities in consideration of certain payments. Convalescent Home.—On September 12th the Council resolved upon adopting the principle of establishing a Convalescent 35 Home of about 20 beds at Dagenham, and referred the subject back to the Public Health Committee for further reports and estimates. General Sanitary Administration.—At the beginning of the year the staff was concentrated at the Stratford office, and two additional Inspectors of Nuisances were appointed. The increase in the staff enabled me to divide the Borough into 12 districts, and by utilising to a further extent the out-door services of the two Senior Inspectors (Mr. W. Evans and Mr. T. W. Crocker) to practically increase the number of officers available for regular inspections from eight to twelve. It was felt by some members that the disuse of Canning Town office was an unwise step, but the fact remains that an enormous increase of work was carried out last year which, in my opinion, could not have been done with a divided office. The details of this work will be seen in the various tables at the end of this report, but as confirmation of my above-expressed opinion, I cite the number of nuisances discovered, and the number of notices served last year compared with the previous year :— Nuisances discovered 1898 1899 29,629 1898 5,484 Notices served 1899 9,503 At the end of 1898, the Council instructed me to institute a houseto-house inspection of the whole Borough, the details of which will be found reprinted at the end of this report. This action is partly responsible for the large increase in both nuisances discovered and notices served. It has also naturally led to a large increase in sanitary works executed, with a corresponding outlay on the part of the owners of property, which has given rise to the expressed opinion on the part of some that your Inspectors are exceeding their duty. Such is not the case. One simple explanation will be patent at once. Before the passing of the West Ham Corporation Act, 1898, my Inspectors dealt only with the branch drains, the main drains were repaired by the Borough Engineer at the cost of the ratepayers. 36 During last year, however, the owners of property were called upon to repair both the branch and main drains, which naturally added materially to the cost of carrying out sanitary notices. That is not the fault of the sanitary officials; the bye-laws of the Borough contain specific directions, which the sanitary officials are appointed to enforce, and it is only by gradually rectifying the defects in old property that one can hope to maintain, if not improve, the standard of health in this rapidly growing town. Sewerage.—Several street sewers were relaid by the Borough Engineer during the year for various reasons. Among others I may specially name the following (all I believe pipe sewers):—Melford Road, St. George's Avenue, Ferndale Road, Chestnut Avenue, Clova Road. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.— Part I. deals entirely with insanitary areas. In May I was instructed to report upon the area adjoining Francis Street, Stratford, but, upon inspection, failed to find, either in the character of the property generally, or in the mortality statistics, evidence which would warrant me in taking action under this part of the Act. In this connection I was specially directed to six houses in James' Place. These each consist of one room downstairs 12 feet by 9 feet by 7½ feet, one room upstairs 12 feet by 9 feet by 7 feet, scullery 11 feet by 6 feet by 7 feet, with small yard and w.c., let for 3s. 6d. per week. Although the buildings are old, the sanitary conveniences are new, and I think the houses serve a useful purpose. Part II. deals with insanitary houses. Under this part of the Act I reported the under-mentioned houses, with the following results :— Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, Ford's Market Rendered fit by owner. ,, 32 and 34, Boyd Road „ ,, No. 21, East Street, Stratford Closed by owner. Nos. 1 to 3, Leytonstone Road Demolished by owner. 37 No. 16, Well Street Rendered fit. „ 2, New Street Closed by owner. Nos. 33 and 34, New Street Closing order obtained. Demolished by owner. „ 35 and 36, New Street Closing order obtained, Demolished by owner. ,, 37, 38, 39, Mew Street Demolished by owner. No. 42, New Street Rendered fit. Nos. 1, 2, 3, Whalebone Lane Purchased by Council in connection with Recreation Ground, and demolished. Part III. deals with " Working Class Lodging Houses," which includes houses or cottages of one or more tenements, and as the Council opened their first cottages under the Act during the year, it may be well to briefly summarize their action up to the end of 189!). Bethell Avenue Houses.—In November, 1897, the Council applied to the Local Government Board for sanction to a loan of £11,146, for purchase of land and erection of 29 double tenement houses. The Board returned the plans with the following suggestions:—(1) Height of rooms should be increased to nine feet. (2) The yard of each house should be increased from 15 to 20 feet long, should be surrounded by a brick wall, and instead of one yard being used in common by the families of two tenements, a dividing wooden or iron fence should be provided. (3) Water-closets should be shut off from the interior of the houses, and entered directly from the outside air. (4) The bedroom on the first floor, which is without a fireplace, and only 7 feet by 6 feet, is too small for separate accommodation ; it would be better to throw this space into the adjoining bedroom, and screen a part off for a separate bedroom, if required." The above suggestions being in advance of the Board's model bye-laws with regard to new buildings, and involving an additional cost of £600 on the estimate of the Borough Engineer, on December 9th a deputation from the Council waited upon the Board, and ultimately accepted all the suggestions, save the provision of dividing 38 brick walls (the external boundary of each block to have a brick wall, and the yard of each tenement fenced with timber). The Council thereupon applied for sanction to borrow an additional sum of £830, the loan being made up as follows:— £ s. d. Land 1,160 0 0 29 houses 10,324 0 0 Road making, 790½ yards at 12s. 474 6 0 Add 30 feet for longer gardens 18 0 0 Sanction was obtained, subject to matters of detail, on 3rd May, 1898, whereupon tenders were invited. On 26th July, 1898, the Council considered the following tenders :— £ G. W. Reed 17,874 J. G. Horlock 15,890 Balaam Bros. 15,550 G. Sharp 15,350 H. J. Carter 13,991 Merridew & West 13,947 but decided to have the work executed by their own workmen, under the supervision of the Borough Engineer. The first 10 houses were thereupon commenced, but the Council decided, with regard to the remaining 19 houses, to reduce their number by two, distributing the additional space thus gained between the 17 houses to be erected. Fresh plans were required by the Local Government Board, which were approved on 15th February, 1899, subject again to the small bedroom on the first floor being thrown into the already widened adjoining room. During the erection of these 17 houses, a strip of land at the rear was purchased for the sum of £200 and added to the yards of the houses. The first 10 houses were completed in May, 1899, at a cost of £450 per house, the lowest tender price being at the rate of £476 per house. 39 The last house of the whole 27 erected was occupied on 5th March, 1900. The tenements each consist of three rooms, scullery, and w.c., and are let at the following weekly rentals : 6s. 6d., 7s., 7s. 3d., and 7s. 9d., which includes in each case 6d. per week for electric lighting, with which each tenement is fitted and supplied. It is estimated that the above rentals will prove sufficient to prevent a loss on the undertaking. High Street, Plaistow.—Four houses, purchased for the purpose of widening the above street, have been handed over to the Housing Committee. Two of these are already let at a rental of l1s. per week. Baker's Row.—Two small cottages similarly acquired are let at 6s. per week Corporation Street Estate.—On 2nd March, 1899, the Council applied to the Local Government Board for sanction to a loan of £5,950 for purchase of land having frontage of about 1,900 feet to Corporation Street and Eve Road, with depth varying from 75 to 80 feet, capable of holding about 119 houses. Sanction was granted on 27th June In May sanction to a further loan of £14,437, for the erection of the houses on above site, was applied for, and granted on 7th September. Manor Road Estate.—This estate consists of 10 acres, giving about 4,550 feet frontage. The cost of the land amounted to £11,750, and the estimated cost of erecting 310 double-tenement houses amounts to £121,546. Sanction to borrow both these sums was granted 27th June, 1900. Channelsea Estate.—Upon the site of this estate, when cleared, it is proposed to erect 47 double-tenement (four rooms) houses of 18 feet frontage, and 12 single-tenement (6 rooms) houses of 15 feet 40 frontage, at an estimated cost (for building) of £29,020. Sanction of the Local Government Board to borrow this sum was granted 27th June. 1900. The acquisition of the site for this purpose has involved the Council in discussion and correspondence since February, 1898. The site, consisting of five narrow streets, forms one of the worst areas in the Borough, and is held by the Trustees of the Rotherhithe Charities. In May, 1899, the Council ultimately agreed to pay a ground rent amounting to £243 10s. per annum for a 99 years' lease, with one year's peppercorn and one year at half rent. When completed, this will form one of the most beneficial of the Housing Committee's schemes. Slaughter-houses, Bakehouses and Common Lodging-houses.—These are all regularly visited by the Inspectors of Nuisances, as may be seen by the table at the end of this report. Two new bakehouses were opened, one at Pond Road and another at York Boad. One old bakehouse in High Street, Stratford, was improved after sanitary notice, while another underground bakehouse (No. 5, Prince Regent's Lane) which had been closed for several months, was reopened. I thereupon reported it as unfit, on sanitary grounds, for use as a bakehouse, and obtained its closure. The shop attached is now used for other purposes. The registered keepers of two Common Lodging-houses were changed, after application to the Council. Women Workers.—The following report, which I have received from Miss Billing, your female Inspector of Nuisances, gives a summary of her action during the year :— The Workshops and Laundries in the district are in a satisfactory condition. There has been a considerable increase in the number inspected during the year, and a large percentage of the Nuisances dealt with, were in connection with workrooms not previously registered. The Laundries require frequent inspections to ensure their being kept in order, owing to the work being done, in many cases, in premises structurally unsuited for laundry work. 41 Summary of Work done during the Year.

I am pleased to be able to record a great improvement in the condition of the Domestic Workshops. It has been most encouraging to see with what readiness many of the suggestions made have been carried out; and it is only when the short time that many of the workers are able to devote to household matters is taken into account that this improvement can be fully appreciated.

At the beginning of the year I had given to me the Milkshop Register, with instructions to make systematic inspections of all the Milkshops and Dairies in the Borough. This has been done at intervals during the year. During these inspections I have found that the management of both Shops and Dairies leaves a good deal to be desired in the matter of cleanliness; especially is this the case with many of the general shops. Owing to the large number of changes of addresses, and the increase in the number of Milkshops, I found it necessary to compile a new Register, which also includes a complete list of farmers supplying milk to the Borough.

Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1899. On 7th February the Local Government Board issued the following Order :— Article I. This Order may be cited as the " Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1899." Article II. Article 15 of the Order (Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1885) shall be altered so that, for the purposes of the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) thereof, the expressions in the said Article, which refer to disease, shall include, in the case of a cow, such disease of the udder as shall be certified by a Veterinary Surgeon to be Tubercular; and the Order and the Amending Order (Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order, 1886) shall apply and be construed with the modifications necessary to give effect to this Article. 47 In a circular letter addressed to Borough Councils, dated 11th March, 1899, the Board points out that the term "disease "in the Order of 1885 is limited to those diseases which were included under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, of which Tuberculosis is not one, and that the evidence given before the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis "abundantly shows how this fact has precluded local authorities from any attempt to deal with Tuberculosis in milch cows, although they have shown themselves alive to the danger and anxious to provide a remedy." "The Board think it will be competent for the Council to employ and pay a Veterinary Surgeon with a view of obtaining a Certificate under the Article, as amended, or to appoint him as an officer for the purpose, if they think fit to do so." This course I have already recommended the Council to adopt in my remarks upon Phthisis. With the circular letter above referred to the Local Government Board enclosed a draft form of model Regulations which are set out below:— Model Regulations: Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops. (Draft Form.) REGULATIONS made by the1 with respect to dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops in the2 Interpretation. 1. Throughout these regulations the expression "The Council" means the1 the expression the " District" means the2 the expression "Cowshed" includes any dairy in which milking cows may be kept, and the expression "Cowkeeper" means any person 1 " Mayor, Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of , acting by the Council " or " Urban (or Rural) District Council of as the case may be. 2 "Borough" or "Urban (or Rural) District of as the case may be. 48 following the trade of a cowkeeper or dairyman who is, or is required to be, registered under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1885. For the inspection of Cattle in Dairies. 2. Every occupier of a dairy wherein any cattle may be kept, and which the Medical Officer of Health, or the Inspector of Nuisances, or any other officer of the Council specially authorised by them in that behalf, may visit for the purpose of inspecting cattle, and every person for the time being having the care or control of any such dairy, or of any cattle therein, shall afford such Medical Officer of Health, Inspector of Nuisances, or officer, all reasonable assistance that may, for the purpose of the inspection, be required by him. For prescribing and regulating the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage, and water supply of cowsheds and dairies in the occupation of Persons following the trade of Cowkeepers or Dairymen. Part I. The Regulations in this part shall apply to cowsheds, the cows from which are habitually grazed on grass land during the greater part of the year, and, when not so grazed, are habitually turned out during a portion of each day. Lighting. 3. Every cowkeeper shall provide that every cowshed in his occupation shall be sufficiently lighted with windows, whether in the sides or roof thereof. Ventilation. 4. Every cowkeeper shall cause every cowshed in his occupation to be sufficiently ventilated, and for this purpose to be provided with a sufficient number of openings into the external air to keep the air in the cowshed in a wholesome condition. 49 Cleansing. 5. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall cause every part of the interior of every cowshed in his occupation to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be necessary to secure that such cowshed shall be at all times reasonably clean and sweet. (2.) Such person shall cause the ceiling or interior of the roof, and the walls of every cowshed in his occupation to be properly limewashed twice at least in every year, that is to say, once during the month of May and once during the month of October, and at such other times as may be necessary. Provided that this requirement shall not apply to any part of such ceiling, roof or walls, that may be properly painted, or varnished, or constructed of or covered with any material such as to render the lime-washing unsuitable or inexpedient, and that may be otherwise properly cleansed (3.) He shall cause the floor of every such cowshed to be thoroughly swept, and all dung and other offensive matter to be removed from such cowshed as often as may be necessary, and not less than once in every day. Drainage. 6. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall cause the drainage of every cowshed in his occupation to be so arranged that all liquid matter which may fall or be cast upon the floor may be conveyed by a suitable open channel to a drain inlet situate in the open air at a proper distance from any door or window of such cowshed, or to some other suitable place of disposal which is so situate. (2.) He shall not cause or suffer any inlet to any drain of such cowshed to be within such cowshed. Water Supply. 7. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall keep in, or in connection with, every cowshed in his occupation a supply of water suitable and sufficient for all such purposes as may from time to time be reasonably necessary 50 (2.) He shall cause any receptacle which may be provided for such water to be emptied and thoroughly cleansed from time to time, as often as may be necessary to prevent the pollution of any water that may be stored therein, and where such receptacle is used for the storage only of water he shall cause it to be properly covered and ventilated, and so placed as to be at all times readily accessible. Part II. The regulations in Part I., and also the following regulation, shall apply to all cowsheds other than those the cows from which are habitually grazed on grass land during the greater part of the year, and, when not so grazed, are habitually turned out during a portion of each day. 8. A cowkeeper shall not cause or allow any cowshed in his occupation to be occupied by a larger number of cows than will leave not less than eight hundred feet of air space for each cow. Provided as follows :— (a.) In calculating the air space for the purposes of this regulation, no space shall be reckoned which is more than sixteen feet above the floor; but if the roof or ceiling is inclined, then the mean height of the same above the floor may be taken as the height thereof for the purposes of this regulation. (b.) This regulation shall not apply to any cowshed constructed and used before the date of those regulations coming into effect, until two years after that date. Part III. 9. In this Part, the expression "Dairy " means a dairy in which cattle are not kept. Lighting. 10. Every cowkeeper shall provide that every dairy in his occupation shall be sufficiently lighted with windows, whether in the sides or roof thereof. 51 Ventilation. 11. Every cowkeeper shall cause every dairy in his occupation to be sufficiently ventilated, and for this purpose to be provided with a sufficient number of openings into the external air to keep the air in the dairy in a wholesome condition. Cleansing. 12. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall cause every part of the interior of every dairy in his occupation to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be necessary to secure that such dairy shall be at all times reasonably clean and sweet. (2.) He shall cause the floor of every such dairy to be thoroughly cleansed with water at least once in every day. Drainage. 13. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall cause the drainage of every dairy in his occupation to be so arranged that all liquid matter, which may fall or be cast upon the floor, may be conveyed by a suitable open channel to the outside of such dairy, and may there be received in a suitable gully communicating with a proper and sufficient drain. (2.) He shall not cause or suffer any inlet to any drain of such dairy to be within such dairy. Water Supply. 14. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall cause every dairy in his occupation to be provided with an adequate supply of good and wholesome water for the cleansing of such dairy and of any vessels that may be used therein for containing milk, and for all other reasonable and necessary purposes in connection with the use thereof. (2.) He shall cause every cistern or other receptacle in which any such water may be stored to be properly covered and ventilated, and so placed as to be at all times readily accessible. d 2 52 (3.) He shall cause every such cistern or receptacle to be emptied and thoroughly cleansed from time to time, as often as may be necessary to prevent the pollution of any water that may be stored therein. For Securing the Cleanliness of Milk-Stores, Milk-Shops, and of Milk-Vessels used for containing Milk for Sale by Persons following the trade of Cowkeepers or Dairymen. Cleanliness of Milk-Stores and Milk-Shops. 15. Every cowkeeper who is the occupier of a milk-store or milkshop shall cause every part of the interior of such milk-store or milk-shop to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time, as often as may be necessary to maintain such milk-store or milk-shop in a thorough state of cleanliness: Cleanliness of Milk-Vessels. 16. (1.) Every cowkeeper shall, from time to time as often as may be necessary, cause every milk-vessel that may be used by him for containing milk for sale to be thoroughly cleansed with steam or clean boiling water, and shall otherwise take all proper precautions for the maintenance of such milk-vessel in a constant state of cleanliness. (2.) He shall, on every occasion when any such vessel shall have been used to contain milk, or shall have been returned to him after having been out of his possession, cause such vessel to be forthwith so cleansed. For prescribing precautions to be taken by Purveyors of Milk and Persons selling Milk by retail against infection or contamination. 17. (1.) Every purveyor of milk or person selling milk by retail shall take all reasonable and proper precautions, in and in connection 53 with the storage and distribution of the milk, and otherwise, to prevent the exposure of the milk to any infection or contamination. (2.) He shall not deposit or keep any milk intended for sale— (a.) In any room or place where it would be liable to become infected or contaminated by impure air, or by any offensive, noxious, or deleterious gas or substance, or by any noxious or injurious emanation, exhalation, or effluvium; or (b.) in any room used as a kitchen or as a living room; or (c.) in any room or building, or part of a building communicating directly by door, window, or otherwise with any room used as a sleeping room, or in which there may be any person suffering from any infectious or contagious disease, or which may have been used by any person suffering from any such disease and may not have been properly disinfected; or (d.) in any room or building or part of a building in which there may be any direct inlet to any drain. (3.) He shall not keep milk for sale, or cause or suffer any such milk to be placed in any vessel, receptacle or utensil which is not thoroughly clean. (4.) He shall cause every vessel, receptacle or utensil used by him for containing milk for sale to be thoroughly cleansed with steam or clean boiling water after it shall have been used, and to be maintained in a constant state of cleanliness. (5.) He shall not cause or suffer any cow belonging to him or under his care or control to be milked for the purpose of obtaining milk for sale—- (a.) Unless, at the time of milking, the udder and teats of such cow are thoroughly clean ; and 54 (b.) Unless the hands of the person milking such cow, also, are thoroughly clean and free from all infection and contamination. Penalties. 18. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing regulations shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Council. Provided, nevertheless, that the Justices or Court before whom any complaint may be made, or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this regulation. Commencement of the Regulations. 19. These regulations shall come into force on and after the day of 18 Revocation of Regulations.1 20. From and after the date on which these regulations shall come into force, all regulations heretofore made under, or having effect in pursuance of, the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1885, shall, so far as the same are now in force in the district, be revoked. As these regulations are the direct outcome of the last Report on Tuberculosis, it is unlikely that this model form will be altered for some years to come, and I recommend the Council to adopt them in place of our existing Regulations. It is difficult to obtain accurately the milk supply of the Borough, but during last year I obtained from voluntary statements certain particulars as to the average daily supply provided by the milk-sellers If this clause is not included in the series submitted to the Local Government Board for approval, it should be stated whether or not there are any regulations in force upon the subject. 55 of the Borough, whom I divided into three classes—(1) large dairymen feeding their milk-walks from their own cows or by country milk; (2) dairymen feeding their milk-walks by purchase from class 1; (3) milkshops without milk-walks. No. of retailers. No. of farmers. No. of bai n gals. No. of pints. Gallons. Class 1 67 64 2,724 46,308 5,788½ Class 2 72 — 274 4,648 — Class 3 236 — - 2,161 — Having regard to the fact that it may one day be necessary for the Council to enquire into the conditions under which the farmers are supplying milk to the Borough, it is highly desirable that the Regulations governing the cowkeepers in our own district should not be antiquated. Unsound Food.—A considerable quantity of unsound food, brought up to the office by the purchaser, was destroyed, and a certificate granted that, in the opinion of the sanitary official, it was unfit for food. The only unsound food actually seized and submitted to the Magistrate were certain tins of condensed milk seized by the Medical Officer of Health in a bakehouse. Conviction and fine followed. In this connection it will be useful to quote the concluding paragraphs of the circular letter of the Local Government Board previously referred to, which, after calling attention to the special qualifications suggested by the Royal Commission as necessary in the case of Meat Inspectors, ends as follows, with "Instructions to Meat Inspectors with regard to Tuberculosis in animals intended for food ":— The Royal Commission recommended that the Board should "be empowered to issue instructions from time to time for the 56 "guidance of meat inspectors, prescribing the degree of tubercular "disease which, in the opinion of the Board, should cause a "carcase, or part thereof, to be seized. "Pending the issue of such instructions we are of opinion "that the following principles should be observed in the inspection "of tuberculous carcases of cattle:— "(a) When there is miliary tuberculosis of "both lungs "(b) When tuberculous lesions are present "on the pleura and peritoneum The entire carcase and all the "(c) When tuberculous lesions are present , , . organs may be "in the muscular system or in the Iymphatic . , seized. "glands embedded in or between the muscles "(d) When tuberculous lesions exist in any "part of an emaciated carcase "(a) When the lesions are confined to the The carcase, "lungs and the thoracic lymphatic glands otherwise "(6) When the lesions are confined to the healthy,shall not "liver be condemned, "(c) When the lesions are confined to the but every part "pharyngeal lymphatic glands of it contain"(d) When the lesions are confined to any tuberculous "combination of the foregoing, but are col- lesions shall be "lectively small in extent seized "In view of the greater tendency to generalisation of tuber"culosis in the pig, we consider that the presence of tubercular "deposit in any degree should involve seizure of the whole "carcase and of the organs. "In respect of foreign dead meat, seizure shall ensue in every case where the pleura have been 'stripped." The Board do not consider it necessary, at present, that anything should be added to these Instructions, or that they should be modified 57 and the Board think that the Council should direct those of their Officers who are employed as Meat Inspectors to act in accordance with the principles thus laid down. The Board may at the same time draw attention to Article 19 (7) of their General Order of the 23rd March, 1891, with respect to the duties of an Inspector of Nuisances in relation to the inspection and seizure of meat. They may point out that where an Inspector of Nuisances is appointed under that Order, or under any Order superseded by that Order, he is required by the Article, in any case of doubt arising under it, to report the matter to the Medical Officer of Health with the view of obtaining his advice thereon. The Board think it desirable that any such Inspector of Nuisances should be reminded of this provision. Offensive Trades.—On 25th January, Police Court proceedings were taken against Messrs. Harrison, Barber & Co., Horse Slaughterers and Manure Manufacturers, in consequence of their factory creating a nuisance. The initial proceedings had been taken in the previous July, and were adjourned in order that the Company might adopt measures to abate the nuisance. At the hearing it transpired that considerable works had been in progress, and on the defendants giving an undertaking to complete such works to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health and to pay 25 guineas costs, the prosecution was withdrawn. Other proceedings in respect to offensive trades will be found in the list of prosecutions at the end of this report. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. -During the year the whole of the 12 Inspectors were employed in turn in taking samples for analysis. I give below the results. In one case only was there an appeal to Quarter Sessions from the Magistrate's decision, in which case a Licensed Victualler alleged as his defence the exhibition of a "notice to customers" in the bar, a well-known notice such as is 58 usual in the trade, but the appeal was dismissed with costs, the learned Recorder being satisfied that the notice was not prominently displayed. The alterations enforced by the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, may be left for a future report as it did not come into force till 1st January, 1900. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, Margarine Acts.— Under these Acts, 494 samples were purchased for analysis, and 53 were returned by the Public Analyst as adulterated. I applied for Summonses, at the hearitrg of which fines aird costs were imposed by the Magistrate amounting to £248 19s. Od. Particulars of the adulteration are given in the tables below :— Number of Samples taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Article. Genuine. Adulterated. Total.

Early in the year the Council resolved that all workmen employed by the Corporation should have a working week of 48 hours. This necessitated considerable increase in clerical work, and alterations in the staff employed, and in the general arrangements connected with the collection. These will be found in two memoranda submitted by me to the Council, which are reprinted at the end of this report. The quantity of house refuse put out varies so considerably from day to day that it is found impossible to limit the hours of all to 48 each week, but by a give-and-take system the extra hours worked by any man during one week are allowed for by his working less than 48 hours during a subsequent week, and at the time of writing the average 48-hour week is maintained very satisfactorily. The total amount collected during the 305 working days of the year 1899 amounted to 26,635 loads, an increase of 1,241 loads on the previous year. No. of loads. Approximate weight in tons. Average daily collection in loads.

In accordance with the instructions of the Council on 11th July last, I submit the following report on the Ventilation of Sewers, with special reference to the abatement of the foul smells lately complained of arising from the open grids in the roadway at various situations in the Borough. The complaints are legitimate; the foul smells at times are nauseating in the extreme, and cannot but be detrimental to the public health. Unfortunately, this nuisance is not confined to West Ham, but is common to London and all towns in England which have adopted the water carriage system together with open street ventilators, and I think it will be admitted by the impartial traveller that, bad as the street smells are in West Ham, they are not of equal volume and potency with those which may be met with in many other districts. Whether this be so or not does not affect the question of injury to health from the inhalation of sewer air, as it is highly probable that odourless air passing out of a sewer may cause damage as well as noxious vapours. It has hitherto been held necessary to provide means of ventilation to sewers in order to avoid risk of pent-up gases, formed by decomposition of sewage, especially where the gradient be insufficient, forcing their way into houses through traps, the open grids fixed in the roadway for this purpose being placed not more than 100 yards apart. The conditions which determine the direction of air currents are highly complex, including force and direction of the wind, variations of temperature within and without the sewer, season of the year, volume and velocity of sewage, etc. As a general rule, there is a current of air in the reverse direction to the flow of sewage, and if 209 this current be at all rapid it tends to draw air into the sewer through the openings on a lower level, and to discharge it at a higher level, so that the highest openings are most liable to act as outlets and the lowest as inlets. There is, however, no constancy in action, even in the same sewer, and all street openings may at different times act as inlets or outlets. To obviate the nuisance arising from foul-smelling grids, various plans have been adopted, with more or less (generally less) success. In some cases it has been advocated to reduce the smell from one grid by placing another on each side of it, thus turning the sewer into a condition approximating an open channel. In many cases charcoal baskets are used under the grids for the purpose of deodorizing the mephitic vapours as they ascend. These baskets act efficiently while the charcoal is dry, that is to say, until the first shower of rain, and have consequently fallen into disfavour. Another device is to construct ventilating shafts, in substitution for the street openings, which shafts are carried up the side of an adjacent house, up the trunk of a tree, or up special columns in the street. They have proved useful as an aid to ventilation at the dead ends of sewers, but they are never of sufficient calibre to prove of value in any considerable length of sewer. To be of any use their size and number must be of such proportions as to entail enormous cost in construction. Practical experience, however, shows that, even where freely provided, they fail to act just at the time when they are most needed, that is to say, where the temperature inside the sewer is higher than that of the air outside, at which time the warm sewer air finds a much readier vent through the road opening than through the high ventilator. Again, ventilating pipes have been passed into stokeholes or chimney shafts. This method creates a strong draft, but its effect is very local, tending to draw air into the sewer from all surrounding openings. It has also been known to draw the traps of house drains and thus allow sewer air to pass into houses while the chimney flue was not working, while some years ago in Southwark it caused an explosion from ignition of coal gas which had accidentally found its way O 210 into the sewer. The method has, I believe, been now abandoned. A somewhat similar mode of ventilation is that known as Reeling's Extractor, in which the sewer air is passed through a ring of gas burners placed beneath a column. The foregoing criticism is equally applicable, however, to Reeling's method. The initial cost is great, the care and attention required mean labour and expense, the action obtained is local, and last, but not least, even where the method does act, it merely treats the offensive symptoms without attacking the cause of the nuisance. All the foregoing schemes are founded upon the belief that there is a large and constant manufacture of foul gases in sewers, that frequently there is considerable pressure of air in the sewers, and that, if sewer air escapes into a house drain, it necessarily escapes into the house. It is not too much to say that all the methods of ventilating sewers (from the point of view of obviating smells) have been weighed in the balance and found wanting, while, singularly enough, the City of Bristol has for many years exhibited throughout its entire area a complete system of absolutely unventilated sewers. During the drought of 1898, owing to the drying of the waterseal of the roadside gullies, complaints of smells led to an attempt on the part of many to urge the City Council to adopt the ventilation of their sewers by means of street openings. The City Council in November considered special reports by Dr. Davies, their Medical Officer of Health, T. H. Yabbicorn, Esq., the City Engineer, and Messrs. Taylor, Sons & Santo Crimp, and "decided by a unanimous vote to adhere to their present system of unventilated sewers." The zymotic diseases which may reasonably be looked upon as likely to be associated with sewer emanations are Diphtheria, Fever, and Diarrhœa. I give below the statistics from the RegistrarGeneral's last-published Annual Summary (1898) relating to these diseases in various towns, including West Ham and Bristol, for the ten years, 1888 to 1897. 211 Death Rates per 1,000 living for the 10 years 1888-1897. All Causes. Diphtheria Fever. Diarrhœa. Infant Mortality per 1,000 Births. 33 Great Towns 20.4 0.31 0.20 0.86 167 London 19.7 0.48 0.15 0.67 155 West Ham 17.4 0.43 0.22 0.76 154 Croydon 14.4 0.29 0.11 0.47 128 Brighton 17.5 0.17 0.12 0.66 148 Portsmouth 17.4 0.17 0.23 0.82 150 Plymouth 20.6 0.16 0.16 0.64 164 Bristol 18.5 0.13 0.12 0.50 144 Cardiff 18.4 0.31 0.17 0.82 160 Swansea 19.0 0.09 0.19 0.36 157 A casual glance at the foregoing table shows that the City of Bristol during the last 10 years not only favourably held its own in freedom from diseases usually held to be indicative of good or bad sanitation, but, in almost every instance, was far in advance of the other towns enumerated. When it is remembered that all the above towns have ventilated sewers save only Bristol, and that, in addition, the sewers of Bristol are tide-locked during several hours each day, it is, surely, wise to pause before making dogmatic statements on the subject of ventilation, and to ask oneself whether the necessity for ventilation on the lines O 2 212 hitherto adopted has been clearly shown, or whether non-ventilation is fraught with the danger to public health which has been handed down as a sanitary axiom. There is no question that in unventilated sewers special precautions have to be taken before entering for repairs, and also that at times some sewer air does occasionally pass the trap at the sewer end of the house drain, but if the house drain be ventilated, as it should be in every case, the air would pass out of the ventilator at a safe height above the roof—a much better situation for such discharge than that of the street level—indeed, the high ventilating pipes of the house drains on either side would appear to be the most natural outlet for excess of gas in the sewer. From the above considerations, 1 am disposed to deprecate any lavish expenditure upon methods of artificially ventilating the sewers, believing that they act when they are not wanted, and fail when they are. I am of opinion (1) that, where practicable, as many shafts as possible should be affixed to the dead ends of sewers and carried up to a safe height—this has been carried out in the past successfully by your Engineer; (2) that each offensive road grid should be dealt with on its merits, the sewer carefully examined at the spot, and any defect or condition calculated to cause deposit or impede the flow rectified; (3) that, where no such defect be found, the grid be closed, care being taken that the drains of all houses in the vicinity are efficiently ventilated, not by openings at or near the ground level (the so-called air-inlet), but by full-bore ventilating pipe carried above the house from the highest part of the drain; (4) that the sewers be efficiently flushed. By efficient flushing I do not mean a spasmodic water-cart, but periodical and daily flushing of the entire system during hot weather. Experts cease not to tell us that there is a plentiful water supply for London for many years to come, but the average Londoner has been gradually educated into the belief that a plentiful supply means, not that he may use plenty, but that if he is careful his supply will not be 213 curtailed during several hours in the summer months. He has come to look upon water as a domestic luxury, and views a lavish expenditure of it for public purposes as almost unwarrantable waste. The whole tendency of recent investigation points to the fact that bacteria and all disease germs are potent for evil when associated with dust, but are easily washed away in liquids. Who shall estimate the value of the lives that probably would have been saved if there had been no dust during the past Summer? Of what benefit as health resorts are West Ham Park and our Recreation Grounds whilst they are in the condition of arid deserts? We all recognize the beneficent influence of rain, but feebly attempt, during seasons of drought, to produce some of its effects with occasional road watering. I believe one of the most crying wants of municipal life at the present time is a copious supply of water for public purposes, and that this want will force itself more and more on our attention during the coming years CHARLES SANDERS, Medical Officer of Health Town Hall, West Ham, 19th September, 1899. 214 COLLECTION OF HOUSE REFUSE. Memorandum by the Medical Officer of Health. Minute of the Council adopted 14th February, 1899: — "That on and after the 1st of May, 1899, no workman shall be employed in the service of the Corporation for more than eight hours a day, or 48 hours a week, except on occasions where it is necessary, such cases to be reported to the respective Committees, and by the Committees to the Council, with particulars of the employment. length of time of extra employment, and the amount, if any, paid for overtime." With a view to making the necessary arrangements for the tarrying out of the above resolution, I beg to submit the following memorandum, embracing (1) the facts relating to the present arrangements for collection, (2) the conclusions to be deduced from those facts, and (3) the arrangements suggested by a consideration of the resolution in association with those conclusions.

Time occupied in Collection- In order to show actual facts as to the time occupied, I append below two tables dealing with the Northern and Southern Divisions for the three weeks ending Saturday, March 18th. The tables differ in this respect:In the Southern Division I have a time-keeper on the shoot, and consequently the times given in Table B are the times when each cart left the shoot for the 227 stable after depositing its last load for the day; in the Northern Division I have no time-keeper at the shoots, and consequently the times given in Table A represent the time as stated by the Filler when each cart has left its beat for the shoot with its last load. In the Northern Division it takes from 1½ hours to 2 hours to get from beat to shoot and back to stable, while in the Southern Division it takes from 1 hour to an hourand-a-quarter to get from Beckton Road shoot to stable. p 2 228 229 TABLE A.

The daily collection of house refuse varies greatly. It varies according to the season, more dust accruing in winter than in Summer; according to locality, more green refuse being collected in the Northern than in the Southern Division; according to day of collection, more dust being put out, as a rule, in the earlier days of the week, when Sunday intervenes, than on the later days; according to the weather—a wet day early in the week will result in a much larger collection on the corresponding day later in the week; according to circumstance— for example, when a large establishment such as a Hospital or School indulges in a special "Spring clean," and lastly, all Bank Holidays and Festivals, when no collection is made, necessitate an almost double collection on the later corresponding days. Although, therefore, I have given the average collection above, the figures must be considered as liable to considerable fluctuation. The beats as drawn up are the outcome of several years' working, the majority of them in areas which have not increased, and are as compact as can reasonably be expected. Moreover, any large alteration now adopted for the purpose of making each beat yield approximately the same amount of refuse would, on the same grounds, require re-adjustment in six months time. And it must be remembered that any alteration in the days of collection would necessitate public advertisement and public billing. For these reasons I cannot recommend altering the old beats (I mean generally; those beats which abut on newly-developing property are of necessity frequently altered by a street here and there, as occasion arises). The essence of the Council's resolution being "time of employment," the only arrangement possible appears to be the use of a sufficient number of carts, having regard to the time now occupied in collection, to allow of each man returning to the stable within 8 hours of his leaving it. 233 The dust carts now leave the stable at 7.30 a.m., and to make an eight hours' day (excluding one hour for dinner) the carts should return to the stable by 4.20 p.m. A careful consideration of the figures given earlier in this report, confirmed by the experience of the Dust Inspectors, shows that this result can be obtained when each cart or van does 2 loads, but that whenever it has to return to the beat for a third load the above hour is considerably overstepped, while a fourth load leads to the very late hours which have frequently pertained with the present number of carts. To obtain the desired result it will be necessary, first, that each carman's day should commence at 7.30 a.m. when he leaves the stable, and second, that the Dust Inspectors be supplied with a sufficient number of carts and vans, the number varying from day to day, according to requisition order from my office. The immediate number of carts required is shown in the following table:— Mon. Tues. Wed. Thurs. Fri. Sat. Total per week. North 27½ 30 28 23½ 27½ 26½ 163 South 15 21 17 14 18½ 17½ 103 42½ 51 45 37½ 46 44 266 The present number of carts dusting are 194 per week, so that the above requisition means the addition of 72 carts per week, or 12 carts per day. In conclusion, I beg to point out that the Council is not in a position to supply suitable carts by the 1st May, and that any but 234 properly constructed carts are most wasteful when employed in dusting. There are, also, many considerations, financial, economic, aesthetic, and hygienic, which naturally arise in association with this subject—these I have omitted, not only for the sake of brevity, but also that conclusions might be drawn, not from any preconceived notions of what might be, but from the actually existing facts, having regard to the specific terms of the Council's Minute. 22nd March, 1899. On 7th June, 1899, a supplementary memorandum was presented by the Medical Officer of Health as follows:— With regard to the Dust Collection, I have been requested by the Highways and Parks Committee to endeavour to order as nearly as possible the same number of vehicles on each day. In order to meet this it will be necessary for the Council to vary the beats scheduled in my report of the 22nd March, 1899. I therefore recommend the Council to pass a resolution in accordance with the Bye-laws, and to advertise:—"That on and after Monday, June the 19th, the days for collecting House Refuse in the under-mentioned streets will be Mondays and Thursdays in each week instead of Tuesdays and Fridays as at present, that is to say:— Victoria Road, Forest Gate, Palmerston Road, St. John's Terrace, Westbury Road, Gipsy Lane (from Westbury Road to Romford Road), and all Romford Road. In the Southern Division the following streets Victoria Dock Road (from Nelson Street to Hallsville Road), Nelson Street, Hoy Street, Smith Street, Poplar Street, George Street, Shirley Street, John Street, Ford Street, Edward Street, Emily Street, St. Luke's Square Greenville Street, Ford's Market, Boyd Road, Lansdown Road, Portland Road, Agate Street, Albany Street, Western Street, Sandford Street, Addison Road, Eldon Street, St. Luke's School, and part of South Hallsville School." In the Northern District we shall have to make ten beats instead of nine under an extra Filler. In the Southern District it will be possible to divide one of the beats between two existing beats. This 235 arrangement will entail my ordering the following carts daily, so as never to vary more than three carts:— Monday Tuesday Wed. Thursday Friday Saturday Total for Week North 29 28 28 26 26 26 163 South 18 18 17 16 16 17 102 47 46 45 42 42 43 265 It must bo clearly understood that this arrangement only affects the number of carts ordered each day from the Stables; it can have no effect upon the time occupied in the process of collection. It will be remembered that, in my memorandum of the 22nd March last, I published figures which led me to the conclusion that a forty-eight hours week—judging by the time then occupied—could be easily carried out if each cart did two loads per day, and the Council empowered me to order a sufficient number for that purpose. 236 It did not appear, however, that a forty-eight hours' week was being accomplished, and I therefore arranged for each load to be signed for on the Way Bills, by which means the hours taken in collecting the loads and in going to the shoot can be traced, and have extracted particulars immediately after the 1st May, and have compared them with the figures of the fortnight ending March 13th, which were given in my report of March 22nd:— FORTNIGHT BEFORE MAY-DAY.

This appears to show that the increase in the number of carts employed for the purpose of effecting a forty-eight hours week resulted in a longer time being taken to collect a less amount. It may also be looked at from another point of view as a simple arithmetical calculation:—If 386 men collect 1,061 loads in 3,926 hours, how long ought it to take 526 men to collect 1,139 loads ? This works out at 3,083 hours, but as a matter of fact, as shown above, it took 4,630 hours. = an excess of 1,547 hours. = 193 working days of eight hours. = at 7d. per hour, £45 2s. 5d. in a fortnight. = £1,173 2s. 10d. in a year. I do not wish in any way to attribute the whole of this result to negligence on the part of the Collectors, but, having very carefully considered the returns, must admit that more time is wasted than should occur in a regular collection. That this is so, is shown by the table given below, which compares the collection on Wednesdays and Saturdays during the past five weeks. 239 Comparison of Time occupied on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The returns lead me to conclude that the loss of time above referred to takes place both in the process of collection and in going to and from the shoot, and I feel sure the Council will recognise the fact that the circumstances detailed above are such as no number of Inspectors nor organization can remedy. Report by the Medical Officer of Health on the Zymotic Death-rate and the Prevalence of Diphtheria in the Borough. December, 1899. To the Town Council of the Borough of West Ham, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, On several occasions during the present Summer and Autumn the high zymotic death-rate, published by me from time to time, was specially noted by the Council, and in close association with the consideration of zymotic disease generally, the prevalence of foulsmelling sewer grids in various roadways of the Borough led to frequent discussion as to the probability of the foul emanations from the sewers having a casual relationship with the zymotic diseases generally, and with diphtheria in particular. I was therefore instructed to report upon the zymotic death-rate. Immediately after these instructions were given the following letter (with enclosure) was received from the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 4th October, 1899. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward to the Town Council of West Ham the enclosed copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Board by 241 Mr. C. A. Matthew, of 29, Beauchamp Road, Forest Gate, with reference to the prevalence of Diphtheria in the Borough. The Board observe from the returns made to the Registrar-General that there has been heavy mortality from Diphtheria in West Ham, 204 deaths from the disease being registered in the Borough in the course of the 12 months ended 30th June last; and, adverting to the information contained in the annual report for 1898 of the Medical Officer of Health with reference to the prevalence of Diphtheria, I am to request that the Town Council will instruct the Medical Officer of Health to prepare a report as to the circumstances under which the epidemic prevalence is maintained, and as to the measures of prevention recently taken by the Medical Officer of Health or the Town Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) NOEL T. KERSHAW, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk, West Ham. [Copy Enclosure.] To the Right Honourable the President of the Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. Sir, I respectfully beg that your consideration may be given to the facts stated below, and that such powers as your Board possess may be used for the public benefit:— (1) A permanent centre of infectious disease exists in the Borough of West Ham, and in the event of such epidemic disease as plague will be a source of danger to the whole Metropolis. (2) The general death-rate of West Ham is less than that of London, but the zymotic death-rate is very much higher. Q 242 (3) Diphtheria causes a large proportion of the deaths from zymotic disease, and the existing fever hospital accommodation is inadequate to receive all cases; an extension of the hospital is now in hand. (4) Diphtheria is most prevalent and most fatal at Forest Gate (including Forest Gate, Park, and Upton Wards), although this is a new district with good roads, gardens, and house drainage almost entirely carried out under the supervision of the Town Council's Inspectors. Upon the occurrence of disease the house drains are almost uniformly found to be in good order. (5) With such general conditions as tend to check disease some special cause of such disease must exist. (6) Such cause is to be found in the offensive stench from the sewer gratings in the roadways, the foul smells being worst in the parts of the district suffering most from diphtheria. (7) The nuisance recurs annually, and its return is always attended by increased diphtheria and other zymotic disease. (8) Complaints have been made to the Town Council, but nothing is done beyond occasional flushing and use of disinfectants, which do not lessen the nuisance and danger to health. (9) The majority of the Town Council assert that diphtheria is the result of what they term "landlordism," i.e., of landlords neglect to keep their property in a sanitary state, and this is asserted notwithstanding the facts contained in Paragraph 4 above. 243 To conclude, I venture to submit that a great amount of preventible infectious disease in the Borough of West Ham is the direct result of a defective system of sewerage and ventilation; and that it is the duty of the Town Council to take immediate action to prevent further sickness and death; that the Town Council is neglecting this duty and will do nothing unless compelled by superior authority, and that in the interests of London as well as of West Ham it is desirable that such pressure should be applied. I therefore beg to appeal for your assistance. I am, dear Sir, Your humble, obedient Servant, (Signed) CHAS. A. MATTHEW. 29, Beauchamp Road, Forest Gate, E., 6th September, 1899. It has been seen by my opening statements that the Council by their instructions to me had already granted the request of the Local Government Board before it was made, and the following report will most conveniently satisfy the instructions of the Council and accord with the desires of the Local Government Board if it treats of its subject under three heads, namely:— (1) The zymotic death-rate of West Ham generally. (2) The circumstances associated with the recent prevalence of diphtheria. (3) The action taken by the Medical Officer of Health or the Council. The Zymotic Death-rate. The zymotic death-rate of a district is calculated on the number of deaths during the year from the seven principal zymotic diseases, namely, small-pox, measles, scarlatina, diphtheria, whooping-cough, fever (including typhus fever, enteric fever, and other forms of continued fever), and diarrhœa. Q 2 244 It was adopted in the early days of preventive medicine, and can now only by courtesy be said to refer to seven diseases, as it includes under one head—fever—diseases of such widely different causation as typhus and enteric fevers together with other ill-defined forms of fever of a debatable character. Its value as a practical guide is greatly diminished also by the marked epidemic vagaries of some of its component parts, such as measles and whooping-cough, but still more by the inclusion of diarrhœa deaths. The disease intended to be included in the zymotic death-rate under the heading diarrhœa is undoubtedly an epidemic disease of a specific character, but in actual practice numerous means are employed by medical men to designate this disease in their death-certificates, all of which have reference to one or more prominent symptoms of the disease, and all of which may at times with equal justice be used to express a diarrhœal disease, which is not of the specific nature of that under discussion. I append some of the terms used:— Diarrhœa. Summer Diarrhœa. Acute Diarrhœa. Epidemic Diarrhœa. Chronic Diarrhœa. Choleraic Diarrhœa. Dysenteric Diarrhœa. English Cholera. Cholera Nostras. Infantile Cholera. Dysentery. Intestinal Catarrh. Gastro intestinal Catarrh. Enteric Catarrh. Gastro-enteric Catarrh. Diarrhœa and Asthenia. Diarrhœa and Vomiting. Diarrhœa and Sickness. Diarrhœa and Convulsions. Gastritis. Enteritis. Gastric-catarrh. Gastroenteritis. Muco-enteritis. Colitis. Entero-colitis. During the present year an attempt was made by the Society of Medical Officers of Health to estimate the methods adopted by each individual Health Officer in the classification of diarrhœa deaths, in 245 the hope of obtaining some uniformity of action. The replies showed that the classifications adopted were varied in the extreme. It is obvious that if many of the above terms be discarded in tabulating diarrhoea deaths, the zymotic death-rate will be comparatively low, while, on the other hand, if most or all of the terms be included under the heading diarrhœa, the zymotic death-rate, especially during the Autumn months, when these terms are most in use, will be correspondingly magnified. It has always been my practice to err on the safe side and include all the above deaths under the heading diarrhœa. The basis for calculating a true zymotic death-rate is, of course, a correct estimate of the population. In such a Borough as West Ham this is more than difficult at the present time. The Registrar-General estimates our population at the middle of this year at 300,241, but for the purpose of my statistics I have hitherto reduced that figure by 20,000, somewhat arbitrarily perhaps, but with the object of avoiding in Census year the unpleasant discovery that I had been prophesying smooth things. The Council will therefore recognize that by gathering within the circle of zymotic diseases as many deaths as possible, and by reducing the population estimate as low as possible, there is a two-fold means by which the zymotic death rate may be increased, and consequently that the rates which I have from time to time recorded have been as high as ingenuity could make them. Together with the zymotic death-rate of West Ham I have usually noted the corresponding rate in London, rather as an item of abstract information than as a standard of comparison, the circumstances of the two districts being so essentially different that on just conclusions can be expected by comparing them merely in one special particular. As might have been expected, the zymotic death-rate of West Ham is always higher than that of London. When, however, working-class districts of London are compared with West Ham and other large towns of England, the mortality from infectious disease in West Ham do not appear in such an unfavourable light. 246 This may be seen in the table below, taken from the Registrar General's return for the 13 weeks ended 30th September, 1899:— Table I. Metropolitan Districts and Large Towns. Annual Death-rate per 1,000 living from Principal Zymotic Diseases. Shoreditch 8.09 Poplar 7.04 St. Saviour 7.79 St. George the Martyr, Southwark 9.21 WEST HAM 7.01 Portsmouth 7.80 Birmingham 7.12 Nottingham 7.04 Liverpool 8.55 Manchester 7.82 Salford 8.79 Burnley 9.99 Preston 8.19 Sheffield 8.83 A similar result is apparent when each disease is considered separately, and various towns compared during an extended period. Taking the ten years 18881897 from the Registrar-General's last annual return, it will be noted that in three of the classified diseases the death-rate of West Ham was lower than that of London—in no case was it greatly in excess of London—while the mortality of many of the large towns exceeded that of both West Ham and London, except in the case of diphtheria. 247 Table II.

They do not tend far upon that road towards improvement which we all desire, but they do suggest that the causes of West Ham's zymotic death-rate are general rather than specific, and that amelioration is not to be sought by any heroic effort in one direction only. It is by some considered abnormal that the zymotic death-rate of West Ham should be high while the general death-rate is low; in other words, that because the one is low the other ought necessarily to be low. This does not follow, as in some respects one of the factors promoting a low general death-rate may aid and abet the establishment of a high zymotic death-rate. This has, I believe, in times past happened in West Ham. The constant accession of young, good lives, such as young married couples from the Metropolis, which has gone on for 248 many years, side by side with the building boom, while tending to lower the general death-rate has not been sufficient to counteract the evils attending rapidly-built houses, more rapidly inhabited—evils such as dampness of dwelling and fouling of the soil, which render the rising generation more prone to succumb to attacks of zymotic disease than, under happier circumstances, they would be. It is thus that the housing problem is looked upon by the Council as one of the most essential to be solved as a means both directly and indirectly of effecting improvement in this respect; directly by levelling up and providing healthy dwellings and indirectly by training the people to value them. The circumstances associated with the recent prevalence of Diphtheria in West Ham. Having dealt with the diptheria prevalence during the year 1898 in my last annual report, it will be convenient to especially consider in this report the incidence and mortality of that disease during the first three quarters of the current year. As a means of comparison I append below the weekly notifications of diphtheria during the past 3¾ years:— Table III. Weekly Notifications of Diphtheria. 1896. 1897. 1898. ¾ of 1899. 14 11 9 41 11 15 6 22 17 12 8 35 38 8 11 47 17 8 13 31 10 8 20 28 14 11 12 27 16 16 19 31 13 7 25 20 8 15 16 17 18 7 9 38 8 5 18 6 8 18 16 21 Total for 1st quarter — 192 — 141 — 182 — 364 Carried forward 192 141 182 364 249 1896. 1897. 1898. ¾ 1899.

It should also be noted that the six Winter months, namely, the last quarter of 1898 and the first quarter of 1899, were marked by the heaviest incidence of the disease—a fact bearing upon the alleged association of the spread of diphtheria with the noxious smells emanating from the sewer gratings in the Autumn. Fortunately the mortality has not advanced in the same ratio as the attack rate, a fact probably due in a great measure to the more extended use of anti-toxin in the earlier stages of the disease. This is seen when the following table showing the monthly and quarterly deaths during the past 5¾ years are compared with the previous table, showing the weekly and quarterly attacks of the disease:— Table IV. Monthly and Quarterly deaths from Diphtheria during the past 5¾ years. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

It will be observed that while the rate of attack during the first three quarters of 1899 was 37 times as heavy as it was in the year 1890, the death-rate during the same period was only 2'5 times as great.

Since the beginning of the year, at the desire of the Council, I have again published monthly spot maps showing the houses attacked by scarlatina, diphtheria, and enteric fever. These maps are not available for reproduction here, being not only out of print but somewhat obscured by the inclusion of other diseases. They are doubtless in possession of members, and if compared may be seen to exhibit, as indeed is extremely common when dealing with town populations, a distribution of disease varying 252 almost directly with the great centres of the population. At the same time the maps do show an excessive incidence of the disease in the northern half of the Borough, a fact borne out by the actual figures given in the two following tables, wherein are shown, (a) the notified cases, (b) the deaths —both distributed to their respective Wards—and, (c) rates of attack and mortality therefrom based upon estimated populations ;— Table VI. t Notifications of Diphtheria during the first Nine Months of 1899, at various Ages, distributed to various Wards.

Before, however, a just estimate can be arrived at, certain points bearing upon these results have to be mentioned. In the first place, the attack rate of Forest Gate Ward is considerably increased owing to an extensive epidemic of diphtheria at the beginning of the year occurring in the Forest Gate Industrial School belonging to the Poplar Board of Guardians, and, in the second place, an allowance must be made for possible error in the estimated populations of the various Wards. With these limitations, I am still of opinion that the fatality of the cases was greater in the Stratford Ward than elsewhere, while the actual invasion of the disease cannot be said to have been inordinately marked in any one area. A careful watch of the notifications received from day to day has not revealed signs of any special localized outbreak pointing to a definite exciting cause, the records throughout the year appearing to suggest that the circumstances associated with the spread of the disease were general rather than specific. Some countenance is given to this view by comparing the diphtheria death-rate during the current year with that of some populous districts in the Metropolis and in other large English towns:— Death-rates from Diphtheria during the first Nine Months of 1899, in certain Metropolitan Districts and large English Towns:— Shoreditch .49 Bristol .08 Limehouse .61 Swansea 1.58 St. Saviour .82 Birmingham .26 St. (xeorge-t he-Martyr 1.08 Leicester 1.02 Newington .87 Liverpool .30 Bermondsey .85 Leeds .64 Lewisham .61 Sheffield 1.01 WEST HAM .61 Table IX. 255 The above-mentioned districts differ widely from one another in their topographical and other circumstances, but they are mostly in agreement with West Ham in having recently suffered a high diphtheria death-rate, presumably due to the general influences which are conducive in all large congeries of people to the spread of diphtheria. What these general influences are, and what special variations of them are observable in West Ham, may be suggested in a few words:— 1. SCHOOL INFLUENCE. The constantly-increasing body of evidence associating Elementary Schools with the dissemination of diphtheria is well known, and there can be no doubt that our schools have to some extent aided in rendering the disease pandemic in West Ham. Looking over the attacks throughout the past, one seems able to detect waves of diphtheria passing over first one school, which for a time forms the chief centre of attack in the Borough, and then moving on to a second school whence, after a more or less determined assault, followed, it might be, by a temporary truce, a fresh campaign opens at a third. During the present year some such sequence of attack was noticeable at Odessa Road, Mathew's Park, and Custom House. In no case could the disease be said to be epidemic in the schools, but the}' were one after the other for a limited time the heaviest sufferers. Tables VI. and VII. show that, during the nine months under discussion, 71 per cent, of the persons attacked by, and 74 per cent, of the deaths due to diphtheria, were between the ages of 3 to 15 years—a heavy percentage when taken with .the fact that, unlike scarlatina, diphtheria is no respecter of age. The reasons for this result are clearly apparent when one views the necessarily close gathering of the children in class rooms, the limited floor area that can be allowed each scholar, the possibilities of indirect contagion through the medium 256 of drinking cups, the liability of children in a feverish condition during the early stages of sore throat to use such drinking vessels more frequently than their healthier schoolmates. These and many other conditions inseparable from school life undoubtedly tend not only to aid in the spread of the disease when once introduced into school from without, but also tend to what Sir R. Thorne Thome has called the "manufacture of a type of disease of particular potency." 2. DISINFECTION. West Ham is at present without a central disinfecting station with an efficient steam disinfector, consequently all textile articles and bedding have to be disinfected at home. The methods employed are (1) disinfection by sulphur dioxide or Formalin (a solution of formic aldehyde), (2) scrubbing of floors, etc., with disinfectants, and (3) stripping and cleansing the walls. Sulphur dioxide is not a potent disinfectant, but it does kill the diphtheria bacillus, and has the merits of ease of application, of reaching crevices which otherwise might escape, and of allowing dust to settle which is subsequently removed by scrubbing. In actual practice the above methods appear to be efficient, as secondary cases after official disinfection are rare in the the extreme; at the same time much greater confidence would be felt if all fomites were submitted to the potent action of steam. -3. FOUL - SMELLING SEWERS AND DRAINAGE DEFECTS. These are associated with diphtheria in the public mind in the direct relation of cause and effect, though no such direct relationship can be traced to any great extent on investigation. Houses of the worst sanitary type sometimes remain free of the disease, while others in which diphtheria is prevalent 257 present a few insignificant or even no drainage defects. That they are a common means of spreading the disease indirectly by inducing a condition of low vitality, often associated with sore throat, a condition rendering the sufferer intensely susceptible to fall a prey on exposure to infection, must be granted, and there is little doubt in my own mind that in this manner the sewer openings in the streets may have acted as one factor in swelling the West Ham diphtheria returns. Nor is this view controverted by the fact that the heaviest returns are observable during the Winter months, and the lightest returns during the Summer when the complaints of foul smells are most rife. The foul smells may not be noticed during the Winter, but the sewer gratings are none the less acting as ventilators, discharging at times noxious, if unobserved, emanations into the surrounding air; and this, too, at the period of the year when catarrhs of the throat and nasal passages are most common, and the vital functions generally less able to resist attack. With regard to the general drainage of houses the same influence may be attributed. It is alleged in the letter addressed to the Local Government Board that in Forest Gate "the house drains are almost uniformly found to be in good order." This is not so. Mr. Roberts, who has acted as Sanitary Inspector in the Forest Gate Ward during the present year, informs me that he finds drainage defects as severe in character and frequency in Forest Gate as he did while previously inspecting in Canning Town, and my own more limited experiences tend to confirm that statement. 4. ABSENCE OF HOME ISOLATION. West Ham may be called, so far as the greater part of its inhabitants are concerned, a two-storeyed, double-family, six-roomed house town. On receipt of information as to the R 258 existence of infectious disease in any house the Inspector immediately visits the house, leaves a paper of "Precautions to be taken in cases of infectious disease," gives directions as to the isolation of the patient, and advises where necessary how best this may be carried out. Unfortunately these precautions, directions, and advice are too commonly honoured in the breach than observance. Subsequent notifications and visits show that other members of the family, especially the children, are allowed freely to associate with the patient, with the direct result that multiple cases in a house are the rule and single cases the exception. Nor, indeed, can any other course be expected, particularly in the Winter months, when the resources of many families are at the lowest ebb, and climatic conditions render it impossible to keep the healthy members of the family very largely out of doors. Absence of available means of home isolation is aggravated by our 5. WANT OF SUFFICIENT HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The present number of beds in the Fever Hospital available for diphtheria is 36. During the nine months ended 30th September, 1899, 240 cases of diphtheria were received into the hospital. Several of these cases were admitted from East Ham, frequently in a condition of extreme gravity, so that considerably less than 25 per cent, of the diphtheria cases notified were able to be removed to hospital. It is difficult to put into words the piteous appeals for removal to our hospital, the surprised looks on receiving information that the beds are all occupied, and the sometimes forcible language at the present inability to provide sufficient accommodation which the members of your Public Health Staff constantly encounter. There can be little doubt that a great deal of preventible diphtheria has 259 arisen from this course, and that improvement will result from our hospital extension, not only by removing cases from homes where it is practically impossible to effectually isolate the disease, but also, by preventing a too early return of those recovering into social relations with the healthy. A careful analysis of cases treated in hospital from April 1st to November 13th shows that the average time during which diphtheria patients were retained in hospital amounted to 35 days, while of those cases treated at home during the same period the average time of isolation amounted only to 19 days, in some cases patients being allowed their freedom in seven, eight, or nine days. In this connection it is well to note the rule adopted by the Medical Officers of Schools Association" XXI. A pupil may go home or rejoin school after diphtheria in no case in less than four weeks, provided convalescence is completed and that there is no longer any sore throat or any abnormal discharge from the throat, nose, ears, or eyes, and no albuminuria, and that bacterioscopic examination of the pharygeal (or nasal) mucus for the specific bacillus has been attended with negative results; this examination having been made in not less than three days after the discontinuance of local antiseptic applications." The wording of the above rule emphasizes, in my opinion, the rigid observance of a four weeks' complete isolation in cases of diphtheria, especially among children of the poor classes, whose convalescence is so often returned by the nature of their home surroundings, and in whom an early return to school may be very liable to produce recrudescence of infectivity. Such are the chief circumstances recently associated with diphtheria in West Ham, and the Council has not been idle in dealing R 2 260 with them. The extension of our hospital in order that it may accommodate 200 patients, so long delayed by reasons which it is unnecessary to detail here, is now proceeding with vigour, and will, we hope, in a few months prove its value in relieving the countless homes where now an attack of infectious disease becomes an overwhelming incubus, and will largely diminish the secondary cases which now are so common. In connection with the hospital extension will be the central disinfecting station, fitted with a large Washington Lyon's Steam Disinfector. The inspection and repair of house drains throughout the Borough is systematically and, I believe, satisfactorily carried out by the Inspectors of Nuisances. The Borough Engineer from time to time reports and obtains sanction to relay defective sewers. Several have been dealt with during the past year, and the current report of the Public Health Committee contains a recommendation to relay two sewers in Clova Road and Chestnut Avenue. With reference to the complaints of foul smells from street grids, the Council some time back obtained reports by the Borough Engineer and Medical Officer of Health, and have instructed the Borough Engineer to carry out a series of experiments, suggested by him, in the Forest Gate Ward. His report will probably be submitted to the Council early in the New Year. Several points usually considered in connection with diphtheria have been omitted or only hinted at in the foregoing report, as they did not give on examination any evidence of materially affecting the incidence of the disease in West Ham during the past year. For instance, the milk supply has been watched, and the source of supply used at each house invaded with diphtheria has been noted, without offering grounds for believing that any particular milk service was influencing the spread of the disease. 261 Again, the effect of sex and age does not appear to differ in West Ham from that shown to pertain in general epidemics. Tables VI. and VII. show the distribution with respect to certain specified ages, and the figures given below show the relative incidence of the disease upon the two sexes :— No. of persons attacked. Males. Females. Northern Division 229 245 Southern Division 200 256 429 501 In reviewing the whole facts, I am constrained to form the opinion that the most potent special causes of the spread of the disease in West Ham, as distinct from the general causes which are applicable alike to all communities, are the want of hospital accommodation and the too early return of convalescents into free association with their friends, which I have previously noted. The Council has recognised this fact for some years, and are now pressing forward the necessary enlargement of the hospital. Until this be completed there can be little hope of effectually reducing the heavj- mortality from diphtheria which West Ham has lately sustained.
