Trenfield (Appointed 1.11.54) 4 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Erith Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1954. The assessment of the health of the Borough is based on a judicious mixture of knowledge and opinion. The former is represented by the vital statistics relating to births, deaths and infectious disease which are compiled in the Health Department and are collated by the General Register Office to allow for comparison with the country as a whole ; the latter is based on personal observation and on information reaching the Department from doctors, sanitary inspectors, health visitors, voluntary organisations and the Press. In a highly developed modern community enjoying the benefits of over 100 years of Public Health one can no longer be content to regard health as the mere absence of infectious or other recognisable disease, although this was the case during the many decades when the amelioration of the external environment was the main preoccupation of the Health Services. This is not to suggest that all the environmental hazards have been removed and, indeed, this is far from being the case. It is true that we now have a pure water supply which has almost totally eliminated the diarrhoeal diseases but we are still confronted with the perils of atmospheric pollution, of the chemical sophistication of much of our food and of a host of less obvious but equally insidious causes of loss of health, happiness and efficiency including those resulting from industrial mechanisation and sociological changes affecting work, recreation and personal objectives. In other words, the state of a modern civilised community must be judged far more from the viewpoint of its mental health than was considered necessary, or even possible, in earlier days. We have no statistics to measure the mental health of the people nor the amount of sub-normal health in general resulting in a departure from that functional "wholeness" which is the essence 5 of health and, while it is true that such philosophical speculations may lead one into fields far removed from the conventional activities of the older public health they are, nevertheless, an important part of the newer social medicine. It is necessary to point this out before proceeding to examine some of the statistical pointers to the health of the Borough. The birth rate for 1954 was 13.51 per thousand of the population compared with 14.63 per 1,000 in 1953 and represents the lowest birth rate ever recorded in the Borough. Thus the downward trend of the past four years has continued. The standardised birth rate, which allows for comparison with other parts of the country, is also 13.51 but the rate is well below that for England and Wales which was 15.2. It looks as if we may have to regard a low birth rate as a permanent feature of our modern society. When this is coupled with a low death rate and a greater expectation of life the result can only be an ageing population with the many social and industrial problems which that must bring. The death rate for the Borough fell still further to 9.9 per thousand of the estimated home population compared with 10.88 in 1953 and a rate of 11.3 per 1,000 for England and Wales. The two main causes of death, as in recent years, were diseases of the heart and blood vessels and cancer, the latter including 13 deaths from cancer of the lung. The prevention of cancer is one of the great public health tasks of the future and may well be wrapped up, in part, with a Clean Air policy, as foreshadowed by the Beaver Report. Since we are mortal and must die of something the best we can hope for is that life should come quietly and peacefully to an end without the intervention of any preventable catastrophe in which category at least some forms of cancer probably fall- The infant mortality rate for 1954, that is the number of children dying in the first year of life for every 1,000 live births, was 19.32 per 1,000 against 32.79 per 1,000 in 1953. This represents a new low record for the Borough the lowest rate previously recorded being 22.8 per 1,000 in 1948. When one considers that in 1908 the infant mortality rate was 80 per thousand live births and in 1938 53.62 per thousand, the 1954 rate represents a very remarkable improvement. Only one of the 12 infantile deaths recorded was due to a condition which may be regarded as being preventable in the present state of our knowledge and it can be said that the standard of maternal care has been adequate. A warning must be 6 given that as one is dealing with a small number of deaths, one has to draw conclusions with a good deal of circumspection, but the overall trend of infant mortality in the Borough is, undoubtedly, satisfactory. Although there were 640 total births during the year there were no maternal deaths. This is a fine record and speaks well for the obstetrical services in the area and for the standard of ante-natal care available for the expectant mother. The incidence of infectious disease was again low. Once again no case of diphtheria occurred but it is still very necessary that mothers should not fail to have their children immunised as only thus can a continued freedom from this disease be ensured. No paralytic case of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough compared with two in the previous year. The number of newly notified cases of tuberculosis during 1954 was 67 compared with 72 during 1953. The number of deaths, however, was only 9 as against 11 in 1953. A comparison of notifications and deaths over the past 10 years is in keeping with the national tendency for deaths from this disease to decrease at a greater rate than notifications. In other words, the curative services are tending to outstrip the preventive services and very much more needs to be done to track down the infectious cases within the community and to lessen the chances of infection of susceptible persons. During the year a survey was commenced in accordance with Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 to ascertain how many houses would require to be demolished within the next five years and it was found that the number of obviously unfit houses was relatively small, and was to be expected in an area in which so much housing development took place between the two wars. The demolition of these houses will not, necessarily, be followed by 100% replacement on the cleared sites, as some of these may be considered unsuitable for new development. The rehousing of tenants may, therefore, be a matter of some difficulty but it is hoped that the rate of demolition will be such as to allow for the assimilation of such families into the Council's rehousing Programme in general. The Clean Food Campaign continued to make real, if not spectacular, progress and at the time of writing 156 plaques nave been awarded by the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Clean Food Traders' Guild. Far more could, no doubt, be achieved " the necessary staff were available, and indeed this applies 7 to Health Education in general. A good case could be made for the appointment of a Health Education Officer to serve the Borough or such wider area as appeared to be indicated. The work of the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee is gaining momentum and will undoubtedly increase the scope of its activities in the near future. Our thanks are due to the Woolwich and Dartford Hospital Management Committees for providing statistics of home accidents treated in hospital over the past year. These undoubtedly emphasise the need for the instruction of the public in the causes of these accidents and the methods by which they may be prevented. The Old People's Welfare Committee, now on a voluntary basis but sponsored originally by the Erith Borough Council, has done excellent work in alleviating the lot of many old people by friendly help, by assistance in kind when necessary, by making arrangements for inexpensive holidays and in other ways. Their work to some extent co-ordinates and is complementary to that of the many old people's organisations in the Borough providing clubs and other recreational facilities, The work of these voluntary organisations is invaluable to the old people in the Borough. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for their devoted service during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON, Medical Officer of Health. 8 Annual Report 1954 SECTION A:—STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames to which it has a frontage of about 4 miles, on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley, and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford. The shopping facilities though not concentrated, are nevertheless advantageous having regard to the disposition of the six wards of the Borough, and there is a copious supply of pure water which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The existing chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage and the production of building materials, i.e., asbestos, plasterboard, and stoneware drain pipes. Manufacture of radio equipment and toys are also established industries. Industrial expansion within the Borough is again demonstrated by the commercial acquirement of factory premises in which the first Transatlantic telephone cable is being constructed and this has necessitated considerable adaptation and enlarging of the existing premises. Progress has also been made in the erection and equipping of a local engineering factory's new turbine shop which will be one of the largest in the country. It is expected that this new shop will be opened and come into production early in 1955. The proposed new Electric Power Station at Norman Road, Belvedere has now progressed from the blue-print stage to that of intial lay-out and preparatory site works. A new Grammar School at Northumberland Heath was officially opened and dedicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury on 3rd December. 9 The Erith Sports Stadium and Arena developed and built by the Council on former derelict land in South Road was used for the first time on 2nd August. The lay out includes running tracks, bicycle racing track, and grassed area with special jumping lanes and pits. Provision is being made for the accommodation of well over 8,000 spectators.

It is also available to authorities who wish to make use of the facilities and in these cases a charge is made based on the cost of the work. C (13) Welfare of Old People The work of the Erith Old People's Welfare Committee continued throughout the year and much good work was done in visiting and provision of good neighbourly services. In addition it has been possible in certain cases of extreme difficulty to arrange assistance in cash or kind. During the year the Committee arranged a week's holiday by the sea for a coach load of needy old age pensioners in May and three coach loads in September. This scheme has been developed, and 1955 promises to show even larger numbers sent on holiday. The Committee also arranged a Christmas dinner and entertainment for 200 old people on Boxing Day. C (14) National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50 (Burials) During the year it was necessary for the Council to carry Out one burial under the provisions of the above Act. In this case deceased was 93 years of age and did not qualify for a burial grant. The death occurred in a local Nursing Home and the only relative was a step sister-in-law who was unable to pay for the cost of burial. 29 SECTION D.—SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for the following information relating to refuse collection and disposal. D (1) Refuse Collection and Disposal The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins, and some 16,500 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local act—the Erith Improvement Act, 1920. Disposal is effected by barging under contract, and these arrangements are still working very satisfactorily. D (l)a Costs £ s. d.

The cesspools requiring this service are in obscure positions which thus necessitates the covering of considerable distances both for pumping and conveying to the point of discharge. D (5)e Smoke Abatement No material change has occurred during the year regardng industrial smoke emission. Implementation of the Beaver Report published in November with respect to smokeless Zones, is awaited with interest. D (5)f Atmospheric Pollution Results of Analysis The deposit gauge which was set up in the grounds of the Royal Alfred Institution has been in operation during the year, and the monthly analysis of contents has been declared as follows :— Month Rain in inches. Monthly deposit. Insoluble deposit. Tons per sq. mile. Soluble deposit. Tons per sq. mile. Total solids. Tons per sq. mile. Calcium Tons squ. mile.

No significant cement dust nuisance has been apparent In the Borough during the year. Wind direction has been Predominently south-west, varying to north-west, such climatic conditions not being conducive to the actual location of dust deposits in the Borough. 33 D (5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road and comprises one pool of some 55,000 gallons capacity which is now exclusively used by the Kent Education Committee during normal school hours, and local youth club during the evenings and on Saturday mornings. Water in the pool is heated to a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit be low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipper establishment with accommodation for 16 males and 4 females. Adjacent to the public ball is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of tit various undertakings in the locality and which include the Corporation's Catering dept., Works dept., the County Health and Education depts., and the Hainhault Maternity Home During the year 73,775 articles were dealt with. Attendances at Public Bath for 1954 Swimming pool Slipper Baths Schools: During term 12,138 Schools: During holidays 1,292 Youth clubs 4,907 Total 18,337 Total 16,430 1953 15,395 1953 13,737 (2) A children's paddling pool of some 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere recreation ground at Woolwich Road. This pool is regularly emptied and cleansed, and during the summer months, is methodically dosed with chloros. Successful miniature boating regattas are held at this site. D (5)h Offensive Trades Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade in this area on 17th March, 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly Other than this class of trade, no statutory offensive trades which are enumerated in Section 107 Public Health Act, l936. exist. 34 D (5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act is designed to secure that clean filling materials are used in the upholstery trade, and whilst there are no manufacturing premises subject to licensing in the Borough, two premises exist where filling materials are utilised and which are registered by the Local Authority. Apart from the incumbent duties of licensing and registration, the operation of this Act includes the inspection of premises and the sampling of rag flock. In this regard, several visits were made to registered premises and two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst with satisfactory results. D (5)j Pet Animals Act, 1951 There are 6 pet animal shops in the Borough and these are subject to annual licencing. All the premises are conducted in a satisfactory manner and in accordance with the statutory requirements. D (5)k Camping sites There are no summer camping sites within the Borough, though one site exists which is subject to licensing under Section 269 Public Health Act, 1936 by the Local Authority. During the year, the area has been free from indiscriminate caravan squatters. D (5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields within the district. D (5)m Rodent control Two operatives continue to be employed on rodent control in accordance with the provisions of circular N.S. 19, and during the year Corporation Sewers were effectively dealt with when 232 manholes were treated. As in previous years each complaint of infestation in private or industrial premises was investigated, and an appropriate charge made for destruction. In conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, a week's film show on rodent control was held in May at Electricity House. This event stimulated considerable interest, and attracted large audiences. Ministry rodent control exhibition stands were displayed at the two Borough Libraries for weekly durations in the autumn. For the purposes of the Prevention of Damage by Pests 35 (Application to Shipping) Order 1951, the following inspections were made at the various wharfs and jetties in the Borough Coastwise vessels 40 Barges 89 Tugs 33 Tankers 1 Dredgers 1 Total 164 No marine infestation was located. D (5)n Pest Control Destruction of ants and wasps nests, beetles, silverfish, crickets etc., is carried out at a cost inclusive of the cost of materials with an apportionment charge of the operative's time. The charges made in connection with this service amounted to £20 16s. 6d. D (5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs All cases of vermin-infested dwellings which come to the notice of the Sanitary Inspectors are appropriately dealt with and it is gratifying to record that the instances of infestations are appreciably reducing. The number of dwelling houses treated during the year are as follows :— Privately owned houses 6 Corporation houses 4 With a view to obtaining good control, occupiers are encouraged to reveal any infestation, when every assistance is given to cope with the menace. D (5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 For the purpose of ensuring that the requisite fireguards were fitted to domestic types of electric and gas fires, and oil heaters, 97 new appliances were subjected to the probe test at retailers' premises. An outstanding deficiency in the Regulations is demonstrated by the fact that, whilst all new appliances sold in shops etc., must comply with a prescribed safety factor, there is no provision for existing appliances which are repaired at shops and elsewhere to be brought up to an approved safety standard. 36 D (7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices Two offices were found to be without the requisite closet accommodation in consequence of which action under Section 46 Public Health Act, 1936 resulted in 8 additional conveniences, together with 18 wash-hand basins being provided. D (8) River Thames—Effluvia Though no complaints were received during the year regarding objectionable odours emanating from the above source, nevertheless such odours were perceptible from time to time, and the conditions prevailing have been kept constantly under review. In September 1954, the Port of London Authority in its annual report for 1953 stated that "the Authority is gravely concerned at the present condition of water in the river. Sewage and industrial effluents as well as flue gas washings from power stations are all making demands on the oxygen content of the river water. Samples taken now indicate at times a state of complete deoxygenation from Erith as far upnver as Battersea." Already there are at least eight power stations along the 20 mile stretch, whilst a ninth is planned at Norman Road, Belvedere. In addition to the intensely rank odours which arise from the polluted river, it is found locally that the aerial pollution D (6) Shops Act 1950 (a) With regard to the statutory hours of closing, it was necessary to issue one warning only upon matters requisite to the closing of shop premises at the prescribed hour. No reference was made to the Magistrate's Court during the year. In connection with a County bird show held on a Sunday, it was necessary to implement Sections 47, 58, and fifth schedule with a view to preventing sales of merchandise. This was effected. (b) Improvements in connection with health and comfort provisions were as follows:- Heating improvements 4 Washing facilities 2 Closet accommodation 2 Cleansing 1 9 37 tends to blacken white paint on houses. Vessels berthed at local wharves appear to be particularly affected, brasswork becoming rapidly tarnished and on occasions turning it green. These, together with other visibly apparent deleterious effects were duly demonstrated by the Chief Sanitary Inspector to the visiting Inspector of the Ministry of Fuel and Power in January this being in connection with the local Enquiry held in December, 1953, with regard to the advent of a Power Station in the district.

The maximum increase in rent following repairs to property is twice the statutory repairs deduction for the house for the purpose of rating purposes. A house must be in good repair before a repairs increase can be claimed by a landlord, who must continue to maintain it in that condition. If, however, the rent is already more than twice the gross rateable value, no repairs increase at all is permissible. At the end of the year one disrepair certificate had been applied for, and this was subsequently granted. D (12) Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1939 During the year, 85 applications were received from tenants regarding assistance with respect to the above Act inclusive of extortionate rents. Appended below is a summary of improvements effected under the statute :— (a) Rent reduced from 10/5^d. per week to 9/6£d. and 3/8d. returned to the tenant. (b) Several recommendations were made to the Rents Tribunal under the Furnished Houses (Rent control) Act, 1946 and the Landlord and Tenant (Rent control) Act, 1949, with good results.

Monk, B.Sc., F.R.I-C-, County Analyst. 42 E (2)a Dairies and Milk stores The register of dairies and milk stores records the following registration figures:— No. of registered distributors 10 No. of dairies 5 Regular inspections have been made during the year with a view to maintaining the high standard of cleanliness. E (2)b Bacteriological Examination of Milk The following samples of designated milk retailed in he Borough were obtained and submitted to the County Laboratory for examination:— Tuberculin tested 6 Sterilised 6 Pasteurised 15 Total 27 All were reported upon satisfactorily, such milk satisfying the methylene blue, phosphatase, and turbidity tests. E (2)c Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies, and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951 Since 1st October 1951 when the above named Order came into operation, the whole of the milk supply in the Borough is specially designated in accordance with the statute. E (2)d Designated Milk The following table indicates the number of licences issued in 1954:- Dealers licences Supplementary licences Tuberculin tested 9 Tuberculin tested 7 Sterilised 31 Sterilised 8 Pasteurised 12 Pasteurised 7 52 22 43 E (2)e The Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 & 1954. The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1953 In accordance with the above Regulations, the special designation "Accredited" was abandoned on 30th September 1954 in this specified Area: thus the only designations applicable to milk retailed in the Borough are now limited to "Pasteurised," " Sterilised," or " Tuberculin Tested." In compliance with Circular MF 23/53, it was necessary to ensure that after 1st October, all milk containers enclosing pasteurised milk were fitted with overlapping caps or covers, As pasteurisers are required to put milk into the containers in which it is to be delivered to the householder, etc., at the premises at which the milk is pasteurised, it is illegal for local retailers after 1st October to bottle bulk supplies of pasteurised milk for delivery to their customers. Two such retail dairy premises existed in the Borough where bulked supplies of such milk were so bottled, and the statute was duly implemented by ensuring that milk was obtained from supplies restricted to pre-packed pasteurised milk in bottles. E (2)f Ice-Cream 123 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice-cream. Of 23 manufacturers entered on the Register, only 5 are active (i.e. 2 boil mix and 3 cold mix). 13 samples were obtained and forwarded for bacteriological examination, all of which were scheduled at Grade 1. E (3) Meat and Food Inspection E (3)a Meat Subsequent to the de-rationing of meat in July 1954, two privately owned slaughterhouses came into operation, one being the subject of an appeal having regard to the Local Authority's refusal to renew a licence under section 57 Food & Drugs Act, 1938. Following upon the successful appeal of the appellant, a deputation of the Local Authority attended the Ministry of Food with a view to seeking implementation of Section 2 of the Slaughter of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1954 which provides for the Minister to make regulations for securing and prescribing requirements as to the construction, lay out and equipment of slaughterhouses. At the same time a submission was made for a review of the Meat Regulations 44 with a view to stabilising the irregular times and hours of slaughtering which now exist. The Inspectors keep a detailed record of all meat etc. inspected and the following table which is in the prescribed form, shows details of carcases inspected and condemned since the resumption of slaughtering in the two private establishments:— Carcases inspected and condemned Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed 233 33 205 438 8,976 Number inspected 233 33 205 438 8,976 All diseases except tuberculosis.

The total weight of meat found to be diseased and unfit at the slaughterhouses was 2 tons 18 cwts. 0 qrs. 14¾ lbs. The total weight of meat confiscated at buchers' shops was 11 cwts. 0 qrs. 27 lbs. 45 E (3)b Other Foods Considerable time and attention has been paid to the inspection of other foods as a result of which 9 cwts. 1 qr. 18 lbs were confiscated at shops and stores in the Borough. E (3)c Disposal of Unsound Meat In accordance with the recommendations of Ministry of Food Circular 10/54 dated 29th June, 1954, meat rejected as unfit is safely disposed of by utilisation for trade purposes and animal feeding, the latter being stained with naphthaline green. Cordial relations have been maintained by all the interested parties and no departure from the approved practice has been observed. E (4) Clean Food Campaign There are 267 food premises in the Borough of the following types:— Fishmongers 17 Bakers 10 Cafes 33 Canteens 13 Butchers 34 Greengrocers 26 Grocers 57 Grocers and confectioners 27 Grocers and greengrocers 5 Confectioners 36 Dairies 5 Food factories 4 There are 207 registered food premises in the area as follows:— E (5) Food & Drugs Act, 1938 Section 14 Ice-cream 123 Sausages and preserved food etc 48 46 E (6) Milk and Dairies Regulations 1949 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1949 Dairies 5 Milk shops 31 Considerable time and attention was devoted to inspections at the above food premises, and where defects or improvements were indicated, proprietors were found ready to co-operate.
