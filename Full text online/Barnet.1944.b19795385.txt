Mrs. Strugnell and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving particulars of the measures carried out in my Department during the year 1944, in administering the Health Acts and Bye-Laws in force in the District. Owing to reduction in Staff, and to the large amount of work the Department is responsible for in connection with the Civil Defence Casualty Services, it has not been possible to do more than submit my report in a very condensed form, as compared with those of pre-war years. It is, therefore, in the main a statistical report. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. General Inspections of the District have been carried out from time to time and all complaints investigated. The course of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to abate the nuisance, continues to be followed, and only if a person fails to comply with this preliminary notice, or strict legal procedure is necessary in the first instance, is the matter reported to the Council and a statutory notice asked for.
