Borough of Malden and Coombe ANNUAL REPORT of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1955 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. June, 1956. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Malden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1955 which has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 17/55. The health of the district remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. The notification rate of whooping cough has fallen, indicating that the immunisation campaign is proving effective. Both the death rate and notification rate of tuberculosis have diminished during the past two years and it does appear that the preventive measures taken against this disease are beginning to be effective. I wish to record my appreciation of the co-operation of Dr. D. M. Stone of the Public Health Laboratory Service, Epsom, who carries out all the bacteriological examinations required by this Department. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their helpful cooperation and the staff of the department for the efficiency with which they have carried out their duties. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, J. B. MORWOOD, Medical Officer of Health, 2 STATISTICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

SCARLET FEVER. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was sixteen, giving an incidence rate of 0.35 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild and no fatalities occurred. Twelve cases were treated at home and four removed to Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. For the eighth year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts are made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. A note is made of every child aged four months and older who has not been immunised and the parents of these babies are circularised in regard to the importance of immunisation against diphtheria. In many cases this personally addressed circular succeeds where other methods of encouragement have failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area have been given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. The following statistics refer to immunisation carricd out during the year:— Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 476, school 44) 20 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 711 Of the above, 143 were immunised and 78 given reinforcing doses by private practitioners. In 1901, 10,000 persons died from diphtheria in England and Wales: In 1955 this number had been reduced to 11. Since 1944 (when records of corrected notifications were first kept) notifications have fallen from over 23,000 in that year to a new low figure of 161 for 1955. 8 The following are figures for deaths and notification: (corrected) since 1944:— Year Deaths Corrected Notifications 1944 934 23,199 1945 722 18,596 1946 472 11,986 1947 244 5,609 1948 156 3,575 1949 84 1,890 1950 49 962 1951 33 664 1952 32 376 1953 23 266 1954 9 173 1955 11* 161* *Provisional. Although diphtheria is no longer a serious public health problem it must be remembered that the disease is still present and that any relaxation of the immunisation campaign could have serious results. Immunisation not only prevents many children from contracting diphtheria, but greatly mitigates-the severity of the illness if a child should fall a victim to this disease. WHOOPING COUGH. The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 57. One case was removed to hospital and no deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. Fortunately the whooping cough immunisation campaign has had a beneficial effect on the diphtheria immunisation campaign because the prophylactic material most commonly used gives combined protection against both whooping cough and diphtheria. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. As whooping cough is most dangerous in the first year of life immunisation should be commenced at the third or fourth month. 9 Details of the number of children immunised against whoop ing cough during the year are as follows:— Primary immunisations carried out by the medical officer of health ... 343 Primary immunisations carried out by private practitioners 134 Children receiving reinforcing doses by the medical officer of health 40 Children receiving reinforcing doses by private practitioners 33 VACCINATIONS. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate times. The view of the Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health is that for adequate protection at least 75% of infants should be vaccinated. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 66% and efforts are being made to increase this figure. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. During the year the following were performed:- Vaccinations 422 Revaccinations 35 457 Of the above, 190 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 376 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. 20 cases of acute poliomyelitis occurred during the year, 9 of which were paralytic and 11 non-paralytic, all in children under 13 years of age. 10 10 of the cases (4 paralytic, 6 non-paralytic) occurred in connection with an outbreak at an infants school. One paralytic case proved fatal. Virological investigation of this outbreak was carried out in association with Dr. Wood of Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., and proved of the greatest value. MEASLES. The number of cases of measles notified (538) was much higher than in 1954. Six cases were removed to hospital. No deaths occurred. SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. Necessary action for these conditions has been very limited and calls for no special comment. FOOD POISONING. One case of food poisoning due to salmonella typhi-murium occurred in connection with an outbreak at a hospital in another district. There were 5 single cases of food poisoning which were due to Clostridium welchii 1, salmonella typhi-murium 3, and salmonella heidelberg 1. *CASES REMOVED TO ISOLATION HOSPITALS.

Twenty-five cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified, one more than in 1954. PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS. Mass X-ray, B.C.G. vaccination of susceptible groups and careful checking of the contacts of all new cases have contributed to the fall in the death rate of this disease. The notification rate has not fallen as rapidly because of the great improvement in diagnosis. TUBERCULOSIS 1938- 1955.

ANNUAL REPORT of THE CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR 1955 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. June, 1956. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Malden and Coombe, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my third annual report on the work carried out by your sanitary inspectors during the year. The year under review has been uneventful and steady progress was made in the work of the Department. Mr. T. P. Jarrett, additional sanitary inspector, obtained an appointment with the Borough of Beckenham in September, 1955, and was replaced by Mr. R. M. Borlase from the Camborne Redruth Urban District in November, 1955. The general standard of housing in the Borough is good and property owners generally have co-operated well in carrying out works of repair. In no case has it been necessary to resort to Court action to enforce notices under the Public Health or Housing Acts. 15 HOUSING. Number of houses built during the year— (a) by the Council 42 (b) by private enterprise 62 Number of houses in course of construction— (a) by the Council 20 (b) by private enterprise 62 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served:— Preliminary 66 Abatement 35 These figures do not include verbal notices often given in regard to minor matters. A housing survey of the Borough was carried out, in order to comply with the requirements of the Minister of Housing and Local Government to submit proposals to the Minister before 1st August, 1955, for dealing with houses unfit for human habitation. As a result of this survey the Council submitted a programme of 8 houses unfit within the meaning of the Section 9 of the Housing, Repairs and Rents Acts, 1954, and suitable for action under section 11 or section 25 of the Housing Act, 1936. The Council propose to secure the demolition of the buildings within 5 years, two of them within the first year. The proposals were approved by the Minister. HOUSING SURVEY. The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any special local tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. WATER SUPPLY. 16 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following numbers of rooms were disinfected for the undermentioned causes:— Tuberculosis 19 Poliomyelitis or suspected poliomyelitis 30 Insect pests 8 Other 3 Two schools were disinfected following an outbreak of poliomyelitis. Four loads of bedding were removed for steam disinfection or destruction, and four bags of clothing were disinfected. A pond was treated for mosquitoes. Routine disinfection after scarlet fever is not now carried out and is only done in those instances where a special request is made. Instead a bottle of disinfectant is left and advice given as to the best method to be employed in dealing with the bedroom used by the patient. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1938.

Garden Mint. — An informal and a subsequent formal sample of garden mint were reported upon by the Public Analyst as containing an excessive amount of stalk. Proceedings had been instituted by another local authority in a similar case. In view of this and having regard to the determination of the standard of contents in such preparations the Committee decided to take no action. It is of interest to note that the case mentioned was dismissed by the Court. Triturated Tea. — The Public Analyst reported that the term "triturated" which signified "ground to a fine powder" was false or misleading. A neighbouring local authority had already taken up the matter with the firm concerned who had agreed to reword the label. No further action was taken. Cherry Cough Syrup. — An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that one of the ingredients did not comply with the details as set out on the label. The firm concerned had new labels printed and no further action was taken. Glucose Beverage. — An informal sample and a subsequent formal sample were reported upon adversely by the Public Analyst who contended that this was a mineral water sweetened with liquid glucose and saccharin and that it contained an excess of benzoic acid in contravention of the Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations. 1925-1953. The manufacturers took the view that this was a cordial and as such the benzoic acid was not excessive. Because of the difficulties of interpretation of the terms "cordial" and "mineral water" details of this case were forwarded to the Food Standards Sub-Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food for their consideration when revising the Regulations. Synthetic Cream Powder. — An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that it was stale and unfit for sale. The matter was referred to the manufacturers and wholesalers who intimated that it was old stock and made arrangements for the withdrawal of this product from sale. Frankfurters. — An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that the ingredients were not specified on the label as required by the Labelling of Food Order. 1953. The matter was referred to the manufacturers who had revised labels printed. Icing Sugar (Lemon Flavoured). — A sample of icing sugar was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported a labelling offence in that the label described one of the ingredients "calcium phosphate" as phosphate. This matter was referred to the manufacturers who stated that they were aware of this error and had already reprinted their labels. Lemon Flavour. — A complaint was received from a housewife that she had poured some lemon flavouring on to fish and after placing it under the grill it had "flared up". A sample of the flavouring was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported as follows — "that it is a sample of genuine lemon flavour. This article is prepared with lemon oil dissolved in isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. It is traditional in character and of ordinary commercial quality. It should not be confused with other types of lemon flavouring which are acid in character and are prepared in imitation of lemon juice. Isopropyl alcohol is inflammable and burns in a similar manner to ordinary alcohol." 19 During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations) (Raw Milk) or the (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Dealers Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Pasteuriser's 1 Sterilised 14 Supplementary. Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 10 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OF MILK TESTING. CLASS OF MILK Number of Samples Tested Appropriate Tests Number of Samples Passed Failed Pasteurised 84 Phosphatase 84 — Methylene Blue 84 — Sterilised 5 Turbidity 5 — Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 52 Phosphatase 52 — Methylene Blue 52 — Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 2 Methylene Blue 2 — Biological 2 — The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. 20 The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. This test is highly sensitive and a failure will result if the milk has been heated to only l½°F lower than the correct temperature of 145°F (holder process), or held for twenty minutes at 145°F instead of thirty minutes. The addition of as little as a quart of raw milk in 100 gallons of pasteurised milk will produce an adverse result. Failures may result from any one of these three factors and inspection of the plant is necessary to ascertain the cause. Farm bottled (tuberculin tested) milk is not pasteurised and is retailed without treatment. In order to ensure, as far as possible, that this does not contain any tubercle baccilli. samples are taken and submitted for biological examination (animal experiment). It is pleasing to record that all the milk samples taken during the year passed the. appropriate tests. FOOD. There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business. FOOD PREMISES No. in District No. of Inspections Made Public houses and hotels 12 4 Works canteens 6 8 School canteens 6 24 Restaurants and cafes 16 40 Grocers (including off licences) 55 59 Greengrocers 22 22 Confectioners 18 36 Bakehouses 4 6 Bakers shops 9 10 Butchers 18 32 Dairy 1 14 Milk depots 5 6 Milk shops 13 43 Fish shops (wet, dry and fried) 3 9 Fish shops (wet) 4 22 Fish shops (fried) 4 4 Greengrocers stalls 2 4 198 343 21 The following premises are registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 for the purposes listed. FOOD PREMISES No. in District No. of Inspections Made Ice cream manufacture, sale and storage 3 Ice cream, sale and storage 77 52 The preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale 43 45 123 97 No ice cream was manufactured in the Borough during the year. It has not been necessary to take legal action under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act or the byelaws made under Section 15 of the Act, informal action in all cases having produced the desired results. The following unfit foodstuffs were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed or handed over for salvage:— Beef 210 lbs. Pork 11 lbs. Corned beef 78 lbs. Luncheon meat 25 lbs. Jellied veal 6 lbs. Meat pies 4 Fish, wet 532 lbs. Roes 14 lbs. Vegetables 1 tin Soup 1 tin Fruit 32 tins Milk, condensed, evaporated, etc. 9 tins Milk dried 22 lbs. Frozen eggs 28 lbs. Sweets 11 lbs. A number of complaints regarding foodstuffs was received during the year, some of which are worth recording :— (1) A complaint was received that consumption of pork sausage had caused immediate vomiting together with a burning sensation of the mouth. Two remaining pieces of sausage were submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that chemical and microscopical examination revealed no abnormal impurities and no pathogenic organisms could be detected on bacteriological examination. (2) A complaint was received with respect to a piece of cream roll containing what appeared to be mouse excreta. On examination, although 22 somewhat similar in shape, it was found to consist of a fragment of partly burnt cake and contained nothing of an objectionable nature. (3) A complaint was received with respect to a small piece of tin found in a milk loaf. The only possible source of this tin would appear to be from the top of a milk powder container which had managed to escape the sieve over the flour bin. Arrangements were made by the firm concerned to use deeper sieves. (4) A resident purchased a tin of stewed steak and gravy from a shop in an adjoining district. The tin contained numerous black specks which gave an unpleasant appearance. Examination by the Public Analyst showed the black specs to consist of spice or pepper and was quite satisfactory. (5) A complaint was received with respect to foreign matter in a loaf of bread. It contained several pellets of grey matter consisting of a mixture of flour or dough, vegetable grease, a little dirt including numerous cotton fibres. It was decided not to institute proceedings and a warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. (6) A complaint was received with respect to moth grubs and frass in two bars of nougat. Proceedings were instituted in this case and the defendant was fined £2 in each case and £3. 3s. Od. costs. (7) A complaint was received with respect to mould growth in a sliced wrapped loaf of bread. This occurred during very warm weather, the loaf having been wrapped before it was properly cool. Steps had been taken by the manufacturers to instal additional fans to assist in the cooling of bread and it was decided to send a warning letter in this case. (8) A complaint was received with respect to a bottle of milk. The bottle had not been properly cleansed before filling with milk. A warning letter was sent in this case. The same action was also taken in a similar case. (9) A complaint was received with respect to foreign matter in a loaf of bread which on examination was found to be a small piece of clinker. A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. (10) A complaint was received from a licensed premises of glass in a sausage. It was found on investigation that a glass had been broken on the same morning within two feet of the basin containing fat and the table on which the sausages were prepared. The Public Analyst reported that the characteristics of the glass alleged to have been found in the sausages and pieces of the broken glass recovered from the dustbin were the same. No further action was taken. (11) A complaint was received of a piece of glass in a loaf of bread. On investigation, the piece of glass was found to fit exactly into a break in a glass dish found at the house of the complainant. Nos. 10 and 11 shew that a very careful investigation must always be made of any complaints of glass in food. ICE CREAM. Forty-one samples were submitted to the methlylene blue test and, of these thirty-seven were placed in grades I and II. Two were placed in grade III and one in the low category of grade IV. The results can be said to be satisfactory. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does 23 serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended :— " Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade 1, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV ". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947. year Total Samples Taken Grades 1 or II. % Grade III. % Grade IV. % 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1.6 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 Nil. — 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 Nil. — 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 Nil. — 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 It should be noted that the three samples placed in grades III and IV were manufactured by firms outside this Borough. The Health Departments of the Councils concerned were notified and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. By reason of the fact that the Council appoint an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Acts, 1938 and 1944, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Orders made under the Act require that on sale an indication of origin be given in the case of certain imported foods. A few cases were found where foreign apples or tomatoes were not labelled as such and verbal warnings were given. 24 HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are laid down with which they must comply. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year but in all cases the appliances inspected were satisfactory. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. The duties of a local authority are to enforce this Act with a view to securing the use of clean filling materials. One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. Two samples were taken during the year and submitted to the Analyst who reported that they were satisfactory. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT, 1950. During the year it was necessary to give warnings to a number of traders for offences in connection with Sunday trading. SMOKE ABATEMENT. During the year complaints were investigated with respect to several factory chimneys in the district. Although observations were kept, in no case was smoke emitted in such quantity as to be a nuisance. Improvements were brought about following discussions with the managers of the factories concerned. 25 RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The obligations of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, have been fully met. The work of rats and mice destruction continues on a well organised basis, providing a free service to householders and making appropriate charges in the case of business premises. The Council depots, sewage disposal works, refuse tip, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food require as one of their conditions of 'Grant' that the soil sewer system shall be subjected to an annual 10% test baiting and any infestation found subjected to initial and maintenance treatments. 277 sewer manholes were test baited and in only one section of the sewer system was it necessary for initial and maintenance treatment to be carried out. Constant liaison is maintained with officers of the infestation division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. I have always found them most helpful and co-operative. Workable Area Committee meetings are held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of rodent control are discussed. HOUSING ACT, 1949 — IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. Following further publicity given to the availability of improvement grants and the easing of the applicable conditions under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, numerous enquiries have been made and premises inspected. Seven grants were approved during the year, three refused and two applications were withdrawn. A particularly interesting case was an application by the Maiden and Coombe Housing Society Ltd. and the Maiden and Coombe Old Peoples Welfare Association for the conversion of a house into 8 flatlets for old people together with accommodation for a house mother. After consideration by the Council and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government a scheme was finally approved. The premises were officially opened on the 26th November, 1955. The cost of the works approved for grant purposes was £3,120. 16s. Od. a 50% grant of £1,560. 8s. Od. being made. The rentals are fixed so as to cover the estimated annual expenditure without showing a profit, and the tenants are enabled to maintain their independence which is so important to old people. In my view with the difficulties arising from an ageing population there is scope for much more work of this nature throughout the country. 26 HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954. Seven applications were received for certificates of disrepair of which five were granted and two refused. Five certificates of disrepair were revoked. MISCELLANEOUS. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for one burial. Requests were received from a number of householders for assistance in the destruction of wasps nests. Some nests were destroyed and other requests were declined where the nests were found to be in positions not causing real inconvenience. Many householders sought the advice of the Department about various animal, insect and mite infestations and were given advice and in some instances practical assistance. That the public appreciate this service is shewn by the many letters and messages received. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council the school kitchens and canteens (six in number) were thoroughly sprayed at the appropriate time with D.D.T. solution as a deterrent against insect infestation. Fifty-seven vacant council houses were inspected for evidence of insect infestation but none was found. Seven licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on two hundred and eight occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained. 27 RAINFALL, 1955.
