On 19th July, 1898, Mr. Yezey reported that, in company with Mr. Beasley, he attended the Conference at the Bermondsey Town Hall, on Friday, the 15th July, upon the subject of Overcrowding and the Housing of the Working Classes, when the following resolutions were passed:— (a) That the London County Council be asked to exercise their power under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act to provide'accommodation within the County of London where required. (b) That the London County Council be approached with a view to the insertion of a clause in their General Powers Bill for 1899 to enable Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards to erect Municipal Dwellings under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. (c) That this Conference is of opinion that the London County Council should contribute towards the cost of building dwellings for the working classes by local authorities in London, such contributions to be determined in case of dispute by the Local Government Board. (d) That Local Authorities should be allowed to permanently retain and manage any dwellings for the working classes erected by them, and that the provision of the Section 12 (5) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, requiring them to sell or dispose of such dwellings within ten years from the completion thereof unless the Local Government Board otherwise determine, should be repealed. (e) That in view of the heavy cost of land in London, and the fact that the value of such land is more likely to increase than decrease, Local Authorities should not be compelled to repay the cost of such land out of the income from the dwellings, and that the period for borrowing for buildings should be extended to 100 years. On 1st November, 1898, the Vestry, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes and Works Committee, passed the following resolutions:— 1. That the Yestry approve of resolutions "a, b, c and d." 2. With regard to resolution " e," 48 (a) That the Vestry of Bermondsey be informed that this Vestry is of opinion that the rents derivable from the letting of dwellings should pay for the cost of the site of such dwellings, as otherwise the result obtained would be a fictitious one, and therefore the Vestry does not approve of the proposal that the cost of the land should come out of the rates. (b) That the Vestry approve of the period of borrowing for buildings being extended to 100 years. Open Spaces. On 7th February, 1899, Mr. Mortimer reported having attended the Conference convened by the London County Council with reference to the maintenance of small open spaces in the County, held at Spring Gardens on Wednesday, 25th January, when the following resolutions were passed : — (a) That the maintenance and control of all open spaces under ten acres be undertaken by the Sanitary Authority for the district. That the Council grant annually to the Sanitary Authority the amount of the cost of such maintenance and control, such sum to be equal to the amount of the average expenditure per annum for the preceding three years upon the maintenance and control of such open spaces, and such annual grant to be subject to a certificate of the Council's officials that the expense has been incurred and the work properly carried out. (b) That any contribution towards the maintenance of any open space which has not been formerly maintained be based upon the above, having regard to the area and position of that already maintained and controlled in the district. Sewer Emanations. On 7th June, 1898, Mr. Vice-chairman Vezey reported that, in conjunction with Mr. Moss and the Surveyor, he attended a Conference at the Camberwell Vestry Hall, on 4th May, in reference to the subject of sewer emanations and ventilation, when the following- resolutions were passed: — 49 1. That the closing of surface sewer ventilators, in response to complaints, increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be attained by the multiplication of ventilators, both surface and uptake shafts, at regular frequent intervals. 2. That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain it is desirable to carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor to the front, side or back of the house to the satisfaction of the local sanitary authority, and that the outlet drain from the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer unless required by Local Sanitary Authority. 3. That pipe ventilators up buildings or otherwise, where possible, should always be adopted, in addition to surface ventilation. Telephone Service. On 17th May, 1898, Mr. Chairman Bisley, J.P., and Messrs. Mortimer and Streeton were appointed to represent the Vestry at a Conference proposed to be called by the London County Council to consider as to what evidence should be put before the Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons upon the subject of the Telephone Service. On 21st June, 1898, Mr. Mortimer reported that, in company with the Chairman, lie attended the Conference at the County Hall, on the 14tli June, 1898, upon the above subject, when the following resolutions were passed: — 1. That in the opinion of this Conference the present telephone service of the London area, as supplied by the National Telephone Company, is both inefficient and inadequate, that the charges, as compared to those made by the same Company in the provinces, are much too high, and that these disadvantages to London are largely due to the abandonment by the Post Office of that principle of competition which was expressly adopted prior to 1892 for the protection of telephone users. 2. That this Conference views with alarm the action of the Post Office in using, for the benefit of the National Telephone Company, its special powers as to the breaking up of streets, as instanced in the recent case of the Commissioners of Sewers and the Post Office, and urges the Select Committee on Telephones, which is now sitting at the House of Commons, to preserve intact that control over the streets which has hitherto been vested in the municipal authority. 50 3. That in the opinion of this Conference the telephone service is of such general public importance, and calculated to become of such general benefit, that it ought no longer to remain exclusively in the hands of a trading corporation, but be worked by the Government as a part of the Postal service of the countiy. 4. That in the event of the Post Office not undertaking a telephone service, it is desirable that the Local and Central Authorities of the London telephone district should at once combine to secure an efficient and cheap municipal telephone service. 5. That the Chair-man of the Highways Committee of the London County Council be requested to place the views of the Conference as indicated in the foregoing resolutions before the Select Committee of the House of Commons. The question of the supply of electrical energy in bulk was also discussed, and resolutions passed as under: — 1. That this Conference regards it as essential to the interests of London as a whole that the present purchase clause of the Electric Lighting Acts which applies to defined areas should also be made to apply to such companies as propose to supply electrical energy in bulk to the whole of London without regard to area. , 2. That while preserving intact the rights of the Local Authorities with regard to electric lighting and energy, in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that the London County Council should be in a position to undertake, if it so determine, and if so requested by the Local Authority, the supply of electrical energy in bulk for the convenience of any districts desiring to be so supplied, provided that the Council does not become competitive with the Local Authority. 3. That in the opinion of this Conference power should be retained by the Local Authority to object to overhead wires for traction purposes, and to have a provisional veto against the granting of an order to any private company. 4. That with reference to question 1— Whether, notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 (1) of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, powers should be given in any cases for acquiring land compulsorily for generating stations, and if so, under what conditions as respects liability for nuisance, notices to surrounding owners and otherwise. 51 answer (b)— Provision should be made for the granting of these powers in the Provisional Orders of the Board of Trade subject to confirmation by Parliament. Such provision would facilitate a continuance of the existing practice, according to which more or less uniform conditions under which undertakers are to work are provisionally settled by the Board of Trade. Procedure by private bill should be reserved as at present for exceptional cases, of the report of the Joint Select Committee, this Conference is of opinion that all existing undertakings should share in the advantages suggested by these clauses. 5. That as regards question 3— Whether, in case of a generating station, however acquired, not being situate within the area of supply, power should be given for the breaking up of streets between the generating station and the boundary of the area of supply, in the report of the Joint Select Committee, the Conference is of opinion that it should be left to the Local Authority to decide the route. 6. That the Chairman of the Highways Committee of the London County Council be empowered to present to Parliament the resolutions arrived at by the Conference with reference to the supply of electricity in bulk. On Gth September, 1898, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk, Wandsworth District Board, with copy resolutions passed by that Board in favour of the Telephone Service being exclusively exercised by the Government, and not undertaken by the London County Council and the other local authorities, and of the undertaking' and property of the National Telephone Company being taken over by the Post Office, when it was Resolved to support the action taken by the Wandsworth District Board in the matter. On 7th March, 1899, Mr. Mortimer reported that, in company with Messrs. Sparkes and Beasley, he attended the Conference convened by the City Corporation to consider the National Telephone Company's Bills in Parliament, held at the Guildhall, on Wednesday, the 1st March, when the following resolutions were passed: — 52 1. That in the opinion of this Conference the powers sought by the National Telephone Company would, if granted and exercised, seriously prejudice the rights and powers of the several Local Authorities, and would be inimical to the interests of the State. 2. That in the opinion of this Conference, representing the London County Council, the Corporation of London, and the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, the Bills being promoted by the National Telephone Company in Parliament should be most strenuously opposed. 3. That the Authorities represented at this Conference be requested forthwith to petition against the said Bills, and to ask their representatives in Parliament to oppose the Bills on second reading, and to take every possible measure to prevent the same from becoming law. 4. That in the event of the Bills being promoted by the National Telephone Company passing the second reading, the Corporation be asked to arrange another Conference with a view to decide as to the best means of continuing the opposition to the said Bills. The Vestry resolved to oppose the Bills (vide Parliamentary). Deputations, Parks and Open Spaces. On 6th September, 1898, Mr. Vezey reported that, accompanied by the Clerk, he attended a meeting of the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the London County Council to advocate the provision of a second gymnasium in Soutlrwark Park. The Deputation presented a Memorial in support of that object, and were very favourably received, it being' intimated that no doubt the gymnasium would be provided by the next summer season. The gymnasium has since been provided, and is very largely patronised. 58 Drainage. Arica Place. On. 3rd May, 1898, the Sanitary Committee reported with reference to the following report of the Surveyor : — Finding that drainage works had been executed without notice at No. 16, Arica Place, I called upon the owner to open out the same for inspection and testing. He has done so, and they were found very defectively laid, passing under the house immediately beneath the floor. The shallowness was unavoidable owing to the condition of the sewer in Arica Place, and at an interview I had yesterday with the Manager of the Society owning the property he promised to relay the drains of the eight houses on the south side in two groups of four each if the Vestry would deepen their pipe. Four of the houses at present have separate connections. I have this morning received a letter from him upon the subject. In April, 1895, when reporting upon an application to drain a stable from Southwark Park Road into Arica Place, I fully set out the condition of the sewer as under: — The Vestry has, however, no sewer in Arica Place other than a 9-inch pipe taking a gully placed halfway along the Place continuing to near the top, at which point it is only 2 ft. 2 in. deep, and contains 6 in. of silt. I have had this pipe examined and find it very irregular in line and level, with little or no joints. If the stable is drained as shown, to take the sewer to the boundary of the property will require about 40 yards of 9-inch pipe, with a manhole in Prospect Street and a flushing shaft at the top end. I estimate the cost at £35. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the necessary work be carried out at an estimated cost of £35 Chilton Street. On 15th. May, 1898, the Vestry resolved to relay the sewer rear of 1 to 49 Chilton Street. 54 Combined. On 15th November, 1898, Mr. Vezey was appointed, in the room of Mr. V. T. Talbot, to attend the Holborn Conference, in conjunction -with Mr. Moss. On 6th December, Mr. Vezey reported having attended, with the Assistant Vestry Clerk, the meeting of the Conference hold that afternoon at the Holborn Town Hall, when the following report of a Committee of the Conference was adopted: — 1. In pursuance of the resolutions of the Conference your Committee presented to the London County Council the draft of the Bill as approved with a request that the Council would take steps to promote it in the last Session of Parliament. At the same time your Committee desired the Council or one of its Committees to receive the representatives of the Local Authorities at the County Hall. 2. To this communication an answer was received to the effect that the Main Drainage Committee of the Council were already of opinion that the existing law should be amended; consequently there appeared to be no necessity for the proposed meeting. The Council further stated that when the Bill was in Parliament it would receive the support of the Council. The Council at the same time called attention to the great difficulty already experienced by them in getting Members of Parliament to introduce and back the Bill and suggested that the Local Authorities should themselves obtain the name of some Member willing to introduce the Bill and take charge of it. 3. In further pursuance of the resolutions of the Conference and acting upon the above-mentioned suggestion, your Committee put themselves in communication with the Members of Parliament for the Metropolis with a view to arranging for a meeting at which the measure could be discussed and some Member selected to take charge of the Bill. 4. Your Committee were informed by the Chairman of the Unionist Members that they did not consider an interview necessary, as the statements made on the subject by the former Deputation from the Conference were fresh in their minds. It may be mentioned that when the Deputation met the Unionist Members on the occasion here referred to, they, without receiving any absolute pledge, gathered from the interview that the Unionist Members representing Metropolitan Constituencies were, with but one or two exceptions in favour of the Bill. 65 5. Your Committee were favourably received by the Metropolitan Members on the Opposition side, who gave an assurance that they would do everything possible to assist the passage of the Bill into law when introduced. 6. Your Committee afterwards had interviews with other Members of Parliament, but were unable to obtain the services of a Member to undertake the introduction of the Bill, in view of the state of business in the House and the fact that it might be expected that opposition would be offered to the Bill on the part of one or two Members, so that it would fall under the Twelve o'clock rule. Your Committee therefore reluctantly came to the conclusion that the idea of securing the passing of the Bill in the late Session must be abandoned. 7. The question of convening a further Conference of the representatives of Local Authorities towards the end of the late Session was considered, but your Committee were of opinion that such a course would not serve any useful purpose, and they therefore decided to leave the matter over until after the vacation. 8. From information obtained from the majority of the various Local Authorities it appears that the cost incurred by the ratepayers of London in discharging in connection with combined drainage liabilities which in equity pertain to private owners amounted during the last three years to upwards of £43,000, or over £14,000 per annum. That this amount will be largely increased year by year is certain, for owners of houses are daily becoming more alive to their legal position, and more ready to take advantage of the difficulty which Local Authorities experience in proving the liability of the owners for these works, the numerous recent decisions in the Law Courts having served to advertise this difficulty all over the Metropolis. 9. There is another point to which your Committee desire to call attention. Since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, there has been increased activity on the part of the Local Authorities in ascertaining the existence of nuisances, and serving abatement notices. If some remedy which will prevent the cost of abating nuisances relating to combined drains falling upon the ratepayers be not found, there is a danger that a less energetic discharge of these duties may ensue, since if zealously carried out, the result is that a heavy and unjust burden is cast upon the ratepayers instead of upon those who in equity should bear it. 56 10. Having regard to these facts it seems curious that whilst the Metropolitan Local Authorities have been unable to obtain the required relief in this matter, a Provincial Authority adjoining London, viz. : the West Ham Corporation, has attained the object in view by inserting in a private Bill promoted by that body and passed in the last Session of Parliament, a Clause which amends in the desired way the definition of the word "drain" so far as the Borough of West Ham is concerned. Your Committee cannot but consider it a striking anomaly that Parliament should not yet have granted similar advantages to the County of London. 11. In the opinion of your Committee it is necessary, in order to secure the passing of the measure, that there should be a combined and determined expression of the views of the Local Authorities of London as to the urgent need for the amendment of the present definition of the word "drain," and it is also necessary to obtain the active assistance of the London County Council and of the Metropolitan Members of Parliament. 12. Your Committee accordingly recommend: — (a) That a copy of this report be forwarded to the London County Council, and that they be urged to take upon themselves the duty of introducing and promoting as a county Bill a measure dealing with the question in the next Session of Parliament. (b) That copies of this report, the draft Bill approved by the Conference and the Section of the West Ham Act referred to in paragraph 10 be also communicated to the various Vestries and District Boards, and that they be requested to press upon the London County Council the necessity of taking such action as is above suggested. (c) That the Local Authorities be also asked to communicate with the Members of Parliament representing their respective Districts, and to endeavour to obtain their active co-operation in the promotion of the Bill through the various stages of the House, and especially of balloting for the Bill with the view of securing an early date for the second reading. H. G. HILLS, Holborn Town Hall, W.C., Chairman. 8th November, 1898. Clause before referred to. Section 42. In and for the purposes of Section 41 of the Act of 1893, the word "drain " shall bo deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses or premises (whether belonging to the 57 same or different owners) are at the date of the passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter, be connected, or which is used, or capable of being or intended to be used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses or buildings directly or by means of any other sewer or drain to any public sewer situate under a street repairable by the inhabitants at large, but shall not include any sewer which has been constructed to the satisfaction of the Corporation under Section 152 of the Public Health Act, 1875, or any sewer which has been constructed by the Corporation for the effectual drainage of the Borough. A Bill dealing with the subject was subsequently brought in by Mr. James Stuart, called the "Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill," the second reading- of which was dropped. Old Road and Manor Lane. On 1st November, 1898, the Yestry resolved to relay the sewer at the rear of Manor Lane in 12-inch pipes, at an estimated cost of £2G0. Rotherhithe Street. On 7th March, 1899, the Sanitary Committee reported with reference to the following report of the Surveyor: — The Lower King and Queen Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, being without any convenience for the men employed thereat, I have received a notice to build and drain a water-closet, but as the Yestry has at present no sewer opposite this property, I have been unable to deal with the notice, and refer the matter for your consideration. The nearest available sewer is a 12-inch pipe running down St. Paul's Lane about 6 ft. 3 in. deep at its entry into Rotherhithe Street, and about 70 yards from the point opposite the property where the water closet is to be constructed. To construct this length of sewer in 12-inch pipes about 7 feet deep to the invert with the necessary manholes I estimate will cost £120. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the necessary length of sewer be constructed, at an estimated cost of £120. 58 Education. On 5th July, 1898, the Vestry had before them a letter from Dr. C. AY . Kimmins, Charterhouse, E.G., stating- that the Joint Committee of the Technical Education Board and the London Society for the Extension of University Teaching proposed to arrange a course of ten popular science lectures to be delivered by Professor V. Lewes, in the Town Hall, commencing in October, 1898, provided the Vestry would grant the use of the Hall for the purpose free of expense apart from any small charge for cleaning. The Vestry Resolved—That the use of the Town Hall be granted for the purpose of the lectures in question upon ten consecutive Tuesday evenings, commencing in October next, at a charge of 5s. for each evening's occupation. Electric Lighting. County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company. On 5th April, 1898, the Vestry had before them a letter, dated 16th March, 1898, from the Secretary to the above Company, again seeking the Vestry's consent to the Company's application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order in respect to the Parish, but no action was taken thereon. On 5th July, 1898, the A estry had before them a notice from Mr. Sydney Morse on behalf of the Company of their intention to make application to the Board of Trade, on or before the 21st December, 1898, for a Provisional Order in the matter of the supply of electrical energy in the Parish. On 20th December, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the map and " Gazette " notice of the intention of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, to apply to the Board of Trade, on of before the 21st December, .1898, under the provisions of the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 59 and 1888, for a Provisional Order to authorise and empower the Company to produce, store, and supply electricity within the Parish : when it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Vestry refuse consent to the granting of a Provisional Order to the Company. On 17th January, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported receipt of the Draft Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888, of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Ltd., affecting the Parish, and with reference thereto that the Yestry had on three occasions refused their consent to the Company's application, and the Company were now proceeding without such consent, the Board of Trade having power to dispense therewith, and if the Yestry desired to bring before the Board of Trade any objection respecting the grant of a Provisional Order, such objection should reach the Board of Trade on or before the 15th January, and if they desired to have any clauses or other amendments inserted in the Order they should be delivered to the Board of Trade and also to the Parliamentary Agents of the Order on or before the time limited for bringing objections. As the Yestry would not meet until the 17th January, and the Committee had no authority to act, they had instructed the Clerk to write to the Board of Trade asking them under the circumstances to extend the time for hearing objections. The Clerk reported that he had carried out the instructions of the Committee, and was in receipt of a reply from the Secretary to the Board of Trade stating that the Board would be prepared to consider any representations made by the Yestry if forwarded to the Department by the 20th inst. Resolved [Mr. Mortimer : Mr. Brown]—That the Clerk address a letter to the Board of Trade, objecting to the application of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Ltd., to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order in respect to this Parish, upon the ground that ample provision exists in the Parish for the supply of electricity, and that it is unnecessary and inexpedient to grant powers to another Company to break up the paving in the parish, as the Yestry will themselves shortly be in possession of the necessary plant at their wharf whereby they could generate and supply electric current to the Parish. 60 The following is a copy of a letter forwarded to the Board of Trade: — Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 18th January, 1899. County of London (South-east) Electric Lighting Provisional Order. Sir, Referring to the application of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, for the above-mentioned Order, I am directed by the Vestry to inform you that they strongly object to the grant of the proposed Order as unnecessary and inexpedient for the following reasons : — 1. That the Vestry have not consented to the proposed Order, and the Company can show no sufficient reason to the Board of Trade for dispensing with such consent. 2. That ample provision already exists in the Parish for the supply of electric current to those who require it, inasmuch as the Board of Trade have as long ago as 1889 granted a Provisional Order to the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, to supply electric energy within the Parish, which Order was confirmed by Parliament on 26th August, 1889. 3. That although the Confix-mation Order before-mentioned contained provision for the compulsory laying down of mains for the supply of current in Rotherhithe Street, Lower Road and Union Road within a period of two years from the date of the Order, the Corporation have not been enabled to carry out the terms of the Order in this respect through lack of demand for supply of electric current until quite recently. 4. That the said Corporation have now laid distributing mains in Lower Road and Union Road and are prepared to lay similar mains in Rotherhithe Street when required. 5. That the compulsory works contained in the draft Order of the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company relate to Union Road, Albion Street, Rotherhithe Street, Lower Road and Swan Lane, which said streets and roads, with the exception of Albion Street and Swan Lane, are already dealt with by the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited. 61 6. That the roads and footpaths in the Parish are constantly being disturbed by Gas and Water Companies in the laying of pipes and mains, which is a source of obstruction to traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, besides damaging the paving, and the Vestry feel that the time has come when indiscriminate powers should not be granted to trading companies and others to pull up and disturb the roads and footpaths of the Metropolis unless some very good and just reason can be shown for so doing, which reason cannot be shown in respect to the Rotherhithe Parish, having regard to the fact that ample provision already exists for the supply of electric current therein. 7. That the Vestry, whilst entirely approving of the idea of the Legislature that monopoly should not exist and that competition is good for the community, are of opinion that if any further powers are granted by the Board for the supply of electric energy within the Parish, it should be to the Local Authority and not to a private trading company, and with this view have under consideration the question of the advisability of applying to the Board of Trade for that purpose. 8. That the Vestry already have in course of erection a Dust Destructor and Wharf in Rotherhithe Street from which electric current may be generated. And to ask that if notwithstanding the aforesaid objections of the Vestry, the Board feel disposed to grant the Order, they will, before so doing, hold a local inquiry in the matter, and if the Order is eventually granted a clause may be inserted therein enabling the Vestry to purchase the undertaking any time after the expiration of seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years from the date of the Order upon terms to be approved by the Board of Trade. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, The Assistant Secretary, Clerk to the Vestry. (Fisheries and Harbour Dept.), Board of Trade. On 21st February, 1899, the "Vestry had before them a letter from Mr. Sydney Morse relative to the County of London (South-East) Electric Lighting Provisional Order, enclosing copy of the Promoters' replies to the objections of the Vestry, which he had that day forwarded to the Board of Trade, also a letter from the Assistant Secretary, Board of Trade, 62 [Fisheries and Harbour Department] upon the same subject, stating that the Board would be glad to receive, as early as possible, any observations the Vestry might desire to offer on the request of the Promoters to the Board of Trade that the consent of the Vestry should bo dispensed with, and also on the reply of the Promoters to the objections of the Vestry. The Clerk reported that he had already furnished the Board of Trade with a very full statement of the Vestry's objections to the grant of a Provisional Order to the Company. Resolved—That the Clerk be instructed to reply to the Board of Trade drawing attention to the terms of the Vestry's previous letter. The Board of Trade subsequently refused to grant the Order. London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited. On Gth December, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported receipt by the Surveyor of a notice and plan of the intention of the Company to lay distributing mains along both sides of Union Road from the junction of Lower Road to Soulhwark Park Road. The Vestry resolved to approve the plan for one side only. Fire Escape. On Gth September, 1898, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk to the London County Council, stating that the Council had decided, on the recommendation of the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade, that whenever a Horsed Fire Escape of the improved pattern is kept at a Fire Station it is not necessary to retain the Fire Escapes hitherto kept in the public thoroughfares within a certain radius of the Station ; that the authorities of the Norwegian Church, Bickley Row, had required the Council to move within a short time the Fire Escape and Watch-box from their premises, the space being wanted for other purposes, 63 and as there were few large inhabited houses within a short distance of such Escape Station the Council had, on the recommendation of the Chief Officer of the Brigade, decided that the said Station be discontinued on the 27th July. Rssolved—That the Clerk be instructed to write to the Council in reply, drawing their serious attention to the necessity for maintaining a Fire Escape in the locality, and that the further consideration of the matter be referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee, with instructions to visit the neighbourhood with the view of selecting a new site for the replacement of the Fire Escape removed from Bickley Row. The following correspondence subsequently took place: — Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 7th September, 1898. Sir, Referring to your letter of the 20th July, 1898, stating that the Fire Escape and Watch Box which have hitherto stood upon the premises of the Authorities of the Norwegian Church, in Bickley Row, were to be withdrawn on 27th July, 1898, the space being wanted for other purposes, I am directed to express the regret of the Vestry at the action taken by the Council in the matter, and the hope that the Council will reconsider the matter and reinstate the Escape in the neighbourhood. In spite of the fact that a horsed escape of an improved pattern is kept at the Rotherhithe Fire Station, the Vestry is of opinion that were a fire to break out in the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, lives might be lost before the horsed escape (which is, according to you, about a mile and a quarter away) could arrive, which might otherwise be saved if the escape were reinstated. If the want of a site stands in the way of the Council reinstating the escape, I am to state that the Yestry is quite confident that one can be found in the neighbourhood of Bickley Row ; in fact, there is every reason to believe that if application is made by the Council to the Rev. Selby Hele, Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, he will be willing to permit the escape to be located permanently in Trinity Church yard; at all events, he is willing to allow it to be put there temporarily at once. I am, therefore, to ask the Council to be good enough to give instructions for the latter to be done, pending some final settlement of the question. 64 May I ask you to bring this letter to the notice of the Council with the least possible delay. Thanking you in anticipation, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, The Clerk, Clerk to the Vestry. London County Council. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 17th September, 1898. Sir, In further reference to my letter to you of the 7th inst., I am directed to point out as an important reason for reinstating the Fire Escape, that the neighbourhood is practically an island, to approach which from the north side two bridges have to be crossed, and from the south side one. These bridges can remain open for 20 minutes at a time when vessels or barges are passing through the looks, and it is obvious that this might be the means of detaining the horsed escape from arriving at a fire in the neighbourhood in time to save life. I am also to state that the neighbourhood is surrounded by large stacks of timber in the docks, and by wharves and works of an inflammable nature, among which latter may be mentioned the Timber Pickling Works. Some of these wharves, I understand, are stored with large quantities of inflammable goods, and if a fire were to break out at any time at one or more of them, great danger would ensue to life in the locality ( as it is a thickly-populated one and the streets are very narrow) if an escape were not promptly on the spot. I am therefore to urge the Council to lose no time in having the escape placed in Trinity Church yard. I am, Sir, yours obediently, JAMES J. STOKES, The Clerk, Clerk to the Yestry. London County Council. Spring Gardens, S.W., 12th September, 1898. Sir, I will lay before the Fire Brigade Committee at its next meeting your letter of the 65 7th instant with reference to the removal of the fire escape in Bickley Row, but I am unable to give instructions for it to be reinstated until I have brought the matter before the Committee. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 24th October, 1898. Sir, I have to inform you that the Vestry at its last meeting appointed a deputation to wait upon the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council, to urge upon them the necessity of the fire escape recently removed from Bickley Row being at once reinstated in the neighbourhood, and I am directed to forward you the enclosed Memorial, prepared by the Delegates in pursuance of the Standing Orders of the Council, and to request you to be good enough to bring the matter to the notice of the before-mentioned Committee, with the view of the said Deputation being received by such Committee at an early date. Thanking you in anticipation, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, The Clerk, Clerk to the Vestry. London County Council. The deputation consisted of the following gentlemen:—Mr. Vice-chairman Vezey, Mr. Moss, and Mr. Stuart. Copy memorial. THE MEMORIAL of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the Administrative County of London, to the London County Council, praying them to at once reinstate the fire escape in the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, recently removed therefrom. V SHEWETH: — 1. That a Fire Escape and Watchbox have for many years stood upon the premises of the Authorities of the Norwegian Church in Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, creating in the minds of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood a feeling of security in the event of a fire breaking out therein. 66 2. That the Authorities before mentioned requiring the use of the site, having given notice to the Council to remove the said Fire Escape and Watchbox therefrom, the Council have decided to discontinue, and, in fact, have already discontinued the Escape Station in question. 3. That the nearest station where a horsed Escape is kept is distant one and a quarter miles from Bickley How, and that the rule of the Council has hitherto been, not to abandon any Fire Escape Station distant more than a mile from a Fire Station where a horsed Escape is kept. 4. That a fire not having occurred in the locality for some years is no guarantee that a fire will never occur therein. 5. That the locality in question is peculiar, inasmuch as at times it is quite an island, to approach which on the north side two bridges have to be crossed, and on the south side one. 6. That these bridges can remain open for twenty minutes at a time when vessels or barges are passing through the locks, and therefore it is obvious that this fact might be the means of detaining the horsed Escape from arriving at a fire in the locality in time to save life. 7. That the neighbourhood is surrounded with large stacks of timber in the docks and by wharves and works of an inflammable nature, among which latter may be mentioned the Timber Pickling Works. 8. That some of the said wharves are stored with large quantities of inflammable goods, and were a fire to break out it might assume large proportions and greatly endanger the lives of residents in the locality, which is thickly populated, principally by persons of the working class. 9. That the want of a site need not stand in the way of the Council reinstating the Escape, as the Rev. Selby Hele, the Yicar of Holy Trinity Church, is willing to permit the Escape to be located permanently in Trinty Church yard. 10. That your Memorialists feel that the action of the Council in the matter is greatly endangering the lives of parishioners living in the locality in question, and they must offer their strenuous opposition to it. 67 11. Therefore your Memorialists ask that they may be allowed to send three or more of their Members to the London County Council as a Deputation, to urge upon the Council the necessity of the Fire Escape recently removed from the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, being at once reinstated; and that having regard to the urgency of the matter, they may attend the next meeting of the Fire Brigade Committee. The Common Seal of the Yestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the Administrative County of London, affixed by Order,. JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. Spring Gardens, S.W.. 25th October, 1898. Sir, Referring to previous correspondence on the subject of the removal of the Fire Escape until recently stationed in Bickley Row, I write to say that the Fire Brigade Committee, having been informed by Mr. Glanville that the Yestry of Rotherhithe desires to attend by Deputation on the subject, will be prepared to receive a small deputation here at 4 p.m. on Thursday, 3rd November. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Yestiy of Rotherhithe. Spring Gardens, S.W., 7th November 1898. Sir, Referring to previous correspondence on the subject of the removal of the Fire Escape until recently stationed in Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, and to the Memorial in support of which a Deputation from the Yestry attended at the last meeting of the Fire Brigade Committee, I have to inform you that the Committee having fully discussed the subject after inspecting the locality, has decided that the consideration of the question of again stationing a Fire Escape at the spot in question shall be reconsidered on the completion of the new road now in course of construction between Deptford Road Railway Station and Lady Dock Bridge. In the meantime, however, instructions have been given for providing near each of the three Fire Alarms in Rotherhithe Street what is known in the fire Bri- 68 gade as a first-floor ladder. These ladders will be placed so that they can be readily utilised in case of need by policemen or others. An intimation will be given to you directly the ladders shall have been provided. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 17th November, 1898. Referring to the removal of the Fire Escape Station from Bickley Row, Rotherhithe. to my letter to you of 24th ult., to the Memorial in support of which a Deputation from this Vestry attended before the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council on the 3rd inst., and to your letter of the 7th inst., stating that the Committee has decided that consideration of the question of again stationing a Fire Escape at the spot in question shall be reconsidered on the completion of the new road now in course of construction between Deptford Road Railway Station and Lady Dock Bridge, and that in the meantime instructions have been given for providing near each of the three Fire Alarms in Rotherhithe Street what is known as a " first-floor ladder," I have to inform you that at the last meeting of the Yestry, I was directed to express their great regret and surprise at the action proposed to be taken in the matter, inasmuch as it cannot possibly be held that the provision of three first-floor ladders is an efficient and proper substitute for the escape removed, and to point out that the use of such ladders upon the occasion of a fire may be a source of further danger, rather than otherwise, as it is obvious that great skill and cars must be exercised in endeavouring to effect a rescue or escape from a burning building by means of an unprotected ladder. That with regard to the decision to reconsider the matter in a year's time (when the new road is finished) the Yestry cannot appreciate the utility of the delay, as when that time arrives, the locality will be none the less an island, but rather more so, as instead of one bridge to cross on the south side, there will be three (see plan enclosed). Under these circumstances I am to strongly urge upon the Fire Brigade Committee to reconsider their decision, and to fall in with the reasonable wishes of the Vestry in the matter; and in the event of the Committee not being willing to do so, to request that a Deputation from the Vestry may attend the next meeting of the Council, when the matter comes up for discussion. 69 The locality affected, as shown on enclosed plan, between points A and B, consists of 733 houses, with an estimated population of between 4,000 and 5,000 people. I am, Sir, yours obediently, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. The Clerk, London County Council. Spring Gardens, S.W., 18th November, 1898. Sir, I laid before the Fire Brigade Committee at its meeting yesterday afternoon your letter of the 17th instant further on the subject of the arrangements for the protection of life from fire in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe Street. The Committee gave further consideration to the question, but in the end decided to adhere to the decision at which it had arrived, which decision will be before the Council for confirmation next Tuesday. I may mention, however, that the three ladders proposed to be placed near the Fire Alarms in Rotherhithe Street will be specially made for the purpose, and each of them will be 24 feet long. The Committee in its last report to the Council alluded to the Memorial which the Yestry had forwarded, and mentioned that a Deputation from the Vestry had been heard by the Committee in support of the Memorial. Under the Council's Standing Orders it is not competent for a Committee to invite the attendance of a deputation at a meeting of the Council; such invitation must come from the Council itself. As regards tne question at issue, however, the Fire Brigade Committee is of opinion that as all the facts will be before the Council the attendance of the Deputation will not be necessary, and it will report to this effect next Tuesday. I hasten however, to give you this early intimation of what is proposed to be done. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. 70 Spring Gardens, S.W., Sir 23rd November, 1898. Referring to previous correspondence on the subject of the removal of the Fire Escape from Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, I have to inform you that the Council yesterday considered the report made by the Fire Brigade Committee, and approved the course taken by the Committee with regard to the arrangements for the protection of life from fire in the locality. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Yestry of Rotherhithe. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, Sir, 27th December, 1898. Referring to the protest of this Vestry against the removal of the Fire Escape from the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, as expressed in my letters to you upon the subject, and also by the Deputation which waited upon the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council on the 3rd November, and to your letters dated respectively 18th and 23rd November, conveying the decision of the Council to approve the action taken by the Fire Brigade Committee in sub stituting three ladders 24 feet long (I am informed they are only 19 feet long) for the Fire Escape which has for so many years stood in the locality of Bickley Row; I am directed by the Vestry to express their great surprise at what they consider a somewhat arbitrary action on the part of the Council, inasmuch as the escape in question was practically first removed and the Vestry notified of the fact afterwards, your letter, dated 20th July, stating the escape was to be removed on the 27th, thus not only ignoring altogether the opinion of the Vestry upon the subject, but debarring them from taking any action to prevent the removal of the Escape. I am also to state that in their opinion the ladders may be a source of danger / rather than otherwise, as it must be apparent to any one that to escape from a burning building by means of an ordinary unprotected ladder requires not only great presence of mind and courage, but skill, qualities which, in the excitement of a conflagration, are sure to be found wanting in a good many people, but especially in women and children and aged and infirm persons. I am further to state that, having regard to the very strong views formed by the Vestry as to the danger of leaving the neighbourhood in question without better means of protection from fire than 3 ladders, views which have been notified to the Council both verbally and by letter, they are somewhat at a loss to understand their want of success in the matter. 71 I am also to state that they feel sure that if members of the Council were as cognisant of the peculiar nature of the district as the members of the Yestry are, they would not hesitate a moment in giving instructions for the escape to be immediately replaced, and they hope that before finally disposing of this matter the members of the Council, or some of them at least, will make it their business to visit the neighbourhood and acquaint themselves with its peculiar features. I am also to inform you that at their last meeting they had under consideration resolutions which have been passed at a public meeting held at Trinity School Room, Rotherhithe Street, on 12th December, at which between 400 and 500 people were present, which resolutions the Yestry decided to support and directed me to enclose you a copy thereof for the information of the Council, and to request the Council to be good enough to receive a deputation of 6 members of the Yestry, together with myself, to urge upon them the necessity of establishing a small Fire Engine Station in a central position between Surrey Lock and Lady Dock Bridges. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. The Clerk, London County Council. The following gentlemen formed the deputation :—Mr. Vice-Chairman Vezey, Messrs, W. Beasley, J. C. Higgs, J. C. Mortimer, R. W. Moss, and R. L. Stuart. Copy Resolutions before referred to : — 1. That this meeting of the inhabitants of Lower Rotherhithe has heard with alarm that the London County Council, having been compelled to remove the Fire Escape which was so long stationed upon the premises of the authorities of the Norwegian Church, has decided not to reinstate it in the same neighbourhood, notwithstanding that the urgent necessity for continuing such a station has been clearly pointed out to them, both by the representatives for Rotherhithe and the Yestry of the Parish. 2. That inasmuch as the position of this part of the Parish is that of an island, ana that serious delays in the approach of Engines and Horsed Fire Escapes might arise in the event of the drawbridges being open at the time of a fire, this meeting respectfully asks the Yestry to again take up the matter with the London County Council, with the view of getting them to reconsider their decision, and to urge on them the necessity 72 for establishing a small Five Engine Station in a central position between Surrey Lock and Lady Dock Bridges. 3. That this meeting requests the Chairman to forward a copy of these resolutions to the Yestry of Rotherhithe, begging it to transmit the same to the London County Council at the earliest possible date, and pointing out the unprotected condition of the lower part of the Parish in the event of a fire, and strongly urges that the ladders which the Council propose to supply will be of no avail to enable women, children and infirm persons to escape from a burning building. Spring Gardens, S.W., Sir, 4th January, 1899. With reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, requesting that a deputation on the subject of the means of protection from fire in the neighbourhood of Rothernithe Street may be allowed to attend the Council, I send herewith a copy of the Standing Orders of the Council prescribing the course to be followed by Local Authorities or others seeking to attend by deputation. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Vestry of Rotherhithe. Spring Gardens, S.W. Sir, I7th January, 1899. Referring to my letter of the 4th instant, I write to say that the Fire Brigade Committee will meet on Thursday, the 19th instant, and that it will be convenient if I receive by the afternoon of that day the memorial which the Yestry of Rotherhithe wishes to present on the subject of protection from fire in the neighbourhood of Rotherhithe Street. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, The Clerk of the Yestry of Rotherhithe. Clerk of the Council. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, Sir, '18th January, 1899. Referring to the correspondence which has taken place on the above subject, I beg to enclose you herewith the Yestry's Memorial, which was sealed last evening, in accordance with the request contained in your letter of 17th inst. 73 I also transmit you, for the information of the Fire Brigade Committee, a plan of the Parish of Rotherhithe, showing the site where the Fire Escape stood; the centre of the "island" ; the distance from the said centre of the island on the north side to the Fire Station in Gomm Road to be 1½ miles ; and the distance from the centre of the island on the south side to the Fire Station in Gomm Road to be over 1¾ miles. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. The Clerk, London County Council. Copy memorial referred to. THE MEMORIAL of the Yestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, in the Administrative County of London, to the London County Council, praying them to at once reinstate the Fire Escape in the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, recently removed therefrom, and to establish a small Fire Engine Station in a central position between Surrey Lock and Lady Dock Bridges, Rotherhithe Street: SHEWETH: — 1. That a Fire Escape and Watch-Box have for many years stood upon the premises of the authorities of the Norwegian Church in Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, creating in the minds of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood a feeling of security in the event of a fire breaking out therein. 2. That the authorities before mentioned, requiring the use of the site, having given notice to the Council to remove the said Fire Escape and Watch-Box therefrom, the Council have decided to discontinue, and, in fact, have already discontinued, the Escape Station in question. 3. That the Yestry was not afforded an opportunity of placing its views upon the subject before the Council until the removal of the Escape was an accomplished fact, and then only upon application. 4. That the nearest Station where a Horsed Escape is kept is distant one and a quarter miles from Bickley Row, and that the rule of the Council has hitherto been not to abandon any Fire Escape Station distant more than a mile from a Fire Station where a Horsed Escape is kept. 74 5. That the Vestry have protested against the removal of the Escape in question, and have been heard by deputation in support of their views by the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council. 6. That the Council have, after being placed in possession of the Vestry's views in the matter, decided to place three ladders, 24 feet long, near the Fire Alarms in Rotherhithe Street in substitution for the Escape; but that, as a matter of fact, one ladder only is 24 feet long. 7. That in the opinion of the Vestry the ladders in question may be a source of danger rather than safety, inasmuch as to escape from a burning building by means of an ordinary unprotected ladder requires not only great presence of mind and courage, but also a certain amount of skill, qualities which are not always to be found in persons under ordinary circumstances, and in the excitement of a conflagration are sure to be found wanting in a good many people, but especially in women and children and aged and infirm persons. 8. That the want of a site need not stand in the way of the Council reinstating the Escape, as the Rev. H. H. Selby Hele, the Vicar of Holy Trinity Church, is willing to permit the escape to be located permanently in Trinity Church Yard. 9. That your Memorialists feel sure that if members of the Council were as cognisant of the peculiar nature of the district as your Memorialists are, they would never have sanctioned such a retrogade movement as the removal of the Escape, and if they make themselved acquainted with the exceptional features of the locality they will at once order the reinstatement of the Escape in the district 10. That a public meeting to protest against the action of the Council has been held in the neighbourhood, at which between 400 and 500 people were present, when some strong resolutions were passed (copies of which have already been forwarded to the Council), which resolutions your Memorialists heartily support and endorse. Therefore your Memorialists ask that they may be allowed to send six or more of their members to the London County Council, as a deputation, to urge upon the Council the necessity of the Fire Escape recently removed from the neighbourhood of Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, being at once reinstated; and of the urgent necessity of some further means of protection from fire being afforded, in the 76 shape of the establishment of a small Fire Engine Station in a central position between Surrey Lock and Lady Dock Bridges ; and that, having regard to the urgency of the matter, they may attend the next meeting of the Fire Brigade Committee. Spring Gardens, S.W., 20th January, 1899. Sir, Referring to previous correspondence on the subject of protection from fire in Rotherhithe Street, and particularly to the Memorial which you forwarded on the 18th instant, I have to inform you that the Fire Brigade Committee will be prepared to receive at its next ordinary meeting a small deputation from the vestry of Rotherhithe. I have accordingly to ask you to be good enough to arrange for the deputation to be in attendance here at 4 p.m. on Thursday, the 2nd of February. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Yestry of Rotherhithe. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, 23rd January, 1899. Sir, I am in receipt of your favour of the 20th inst., informing me that the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council will be prepared to receive the deputation appointed by the Vestry on Thursday, 2nd February next, at 4 p.m. I will accordingly make the necessary arrangements for that purpose. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. The Clerk, London County Council. Spring Gardens, S.W., 16th February, 1899. Sir, Referring to previous correspondence on the subject of protection from fire in Rotherhithe Street and the neighbourhood, I send herewith, for the information of the Vestry of 76 Rotherhithe, a report made to the Council by the Fire Brigade Committee on the question. The report was adopted by the Council last Tuesday, and the Fire Brigade Committee will in due course take steps to give effect thereto. It will be observed that pending the erection of a permanent Fire Station in the locality the provision of a temporary station is authorised. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Yestry of Rotherhithe. Report referred to. 13.—The Council on 22nd November last approved the course taken by us in arranging for the placing near each of the three fire alarms in Rotherhithe Street of a ladder 24 feet long for life saving purposes in the event of fire. This action was taken on the recommendation of the chief officer to meet the objections of the Yestry of Rotherhithe, who had protested against the removal of the Fire Escape which for some years had stood near the Norwegian Church in Bickley Row, Rotherhithe, but which the authorities of the church had called upon the Council to remove as they required the space. The Council's resolution was communicated to the Yestry of Rotherhithe, and that body at the end of December sent a communication in which it expressed great surprise at the action of the Council and gave reasons for its opinion that danger would attend the use of the ladders referred to. The Yestry asked that, before finally deciding the matter, members of the Council would visit the locality to acquaint themselves with its peculiar geographical features, and also forwarded a copy of resolutions passed at a public meeting of ratepayers urging that the Escape in question should be replaced, and that a small Fire Engine Station should be established between Surrey Lock and Lady Dock Bridges. The Yestry asked the Council to receive a deputation in support of such requests. Subsequently the Yestry forwarded, in compliance with the Council's standing Order, a Memorial with regard to the above-mentioned requests, but, as we judged that the Council would not wish to receive the deputation, we ourselves have received the deputation. None of the statements made, either in the Memorial or by the deputation, have induced us to alter our opinion that the area within which proper protection is afforded by a Hand Escape in charge of one fireman is extremely limited, and we are therefore not 77 prepared to recommend the re-establishment of the Escape Station in question. We have, however, given further consideration to the whole question of protection from fire in the locality, and we have received a further report on the subject from the chief officer. He states that, when he last advised us on the subject, he was under the impression that the new road to be constructed from Lower Road, Rotherhithe, to Commercial Dock Road through some of the Surrey Commercial Docks would be free from all obstructions, but that it now appears that the thoroughfare will be obstructed by two swing bridges, apart from the swing bridge in Commercial Dock Road over Lady Dock, that is to say, there will be between the Rotherhithe Fire Engine Station and Rotherhithe Street no less than three bridges liable to be open at any moment. The area is practically an island, and is roughly in the shape of a horseshoe, in the centre of which Rotherhithe Street, which is nearly two miles long, runs. When it is stated that, from the centre of that portion of Rotherhithe Street which is cut off by bridges from the rest of the locality, the distance in one direction to the Rotherhithe Fire Station is a mile and a half, and in the other direction a mile and three-quarters, it will be seen that any delay arising from swing bridges being open at a time when fire appliances have to pass might lead to a serious result. In order to protect the neighbourhood by means of Hand Fire Escapes there would have to be at least three machines, for working which five men would be required, but the firemen would be on duty by night only, and further would only be able to save life within a comparatively small radius from the points where they were stationed. The locality contains large factories, oil-mills, and timber stores, and, with a view to providing adequate protection for property as well as for life, the chief officer suggests that a sub-station should be established near Lavender Dock, distant rather more than a mile and a half from the Rotherhithe Station. The proposed station would be equipped with a pair of horses and an Escape mounted on a van containing fire-extinguishing appliances, and the staff by which it would be necessary to augment the Brigade to enable duty to be carried on would be one officer, five firemen, and a coachman. We think such a station should be established in due course, but, as some years will be occupied in acquiring a suitable site, preparing plans, and erecting a permanent building, the cost of which will probably be not less than £7,000, we propose that on a site being secured there shall be erected thereon a temporary structure to provide accommodation for the staff and appliances. In order to give the Council an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the proposal we have forwarded to the Finance Committee an estimate of £100 in respect of preliminary expenses, and we recommend : — 78 (a) That the estimate of £100 to be submitted by the Finance Committee in respect of expenses in connection with the contemplated establishment of a sub-station in Rotherhithe Street be approved. (b) That the Fire Brigade Committee be authorised to make the necessary preliminary arrangements for the establishment of a sub-station at or near Lavender Dock in Rotherhithe Street, and for the erection on the proposed site of a temporary structure pending tne erection of a permanent building. Nothing had been done to give effect to the before mentioned resolutions at the close of the year. Her Majesty's Jubilee, 1897. Almshouses.

EDWARD JOSSELYN BECK, Chairman. JAMES C. HIGGS. GEORGE MABBS. Housing of the Working Classes Act. London (Fulford Street and Braddon Street, Rotherhithe) Improvement Scheme. The following letter, dated 11th March, 1898, from the Assistant Secretary to the Local Government Board having been received:— Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward, for any observations which it may be desired to offer, the accompanying Draft of the Order which they have caused to be prepared for sanctioning, with modifications, the scheme made by the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe under Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, 83 In connection with the provisions for the rehousing of persons displaced by the scheme, the Board have experienced a difficulty, inasmuch as they have been advised that the cleared area would be insufficient in extent to provide adequate accommodation for 550 persons, unless recourse be had to the erection of a block or blocks of tenement buildings. Assuming therefore that the Vestry and County Council desire to avoid the construction of such buildings, the Board have deemed it necessary to provide for the use of some other suitable sire for some of the dwellings to be erected in pursuance of the scheme. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, S. B. PROYISj Assistant Secretary. Modifications referred to:— Art. 1. We sanction the scheme subject to the following modifications, namely:— 1. The clause of the scheme numbered 4 shall be omitted. 2. The scheme so far as it relates to the laying out of convenient streets and other matters not provided for in this Order shall be carried out in such manner as may be determined from time Fo time hereafter by plans, sections and specifications under the seal of the Local Authority and approved by us. 3. The Local Authority shall not without our sanction sell or let any of the lands in the area comprised in the scheme for any purposes other than the erection of suitable dwellings for the accommodation of persons of the working class. 4. (a) Suitable dwellings, according to plans, to be prepared by the Local Authority and agreed upon between them and the London County Council shall be erected on the area comprised in the scheme for the accommodation of two hundred and forty persons of the working class, and on some other suitable site or sites, to be approved by the Local Government Board, for three hundred and ten persons of the working class. Provided that in the event of a difference arising between the Local Authority and the London County Council with respect to such plans the same shall be referred to us, and our decision thereon shall be final and conclusive. (b) The Local Authority may, for the purpose of providing accommodation for the three hundred and ten persons of the working class for whom accommodation is to be provided on some other site or sites than the area comprised in the scheme, appropriate any lands for the time being belonging to them which are suitable, or may purchase by agreement any such further lands as may be convenient. 84 (c) The dwellings to be provided in pursuance of the provisions of paragraph (a) hereof may, if the London County Council so require, be furnished in lieu of dust shoots with such suitable ash pits within the meaning of Section 141 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as may be in accordance with the requirements of any bye-laws made by the London County Council under the provisions of Sub-Section (1) of Section 39 of that Act. 5. One-half of the said area shall be cleared of buildings as soon as the Local Authority shall have acquired the same, but until such provision as is hereinbefore mentioned shall have been made on such half of the said area for the accommodation of one hundred and twenty persons of the working class, and on some other suitable site or sites to oe approved by the Local Government Board for one hundred and fifty-five persons of the working class, no buildings occupied as dwelling-houses at the date of the scheme in the remaining half of such area shall be demolished. 6. If within one year from the time when one-half of the said area or the remainder of the said area, as the case may be, shall have been cleared of buildings as aforesaid, such dwellings as are hereinbefore required to be erected for persons of the working class have not been erected the Local Authority shall, unless We shall otherwise Order, themselves erect such dwellings, and for the purpose of defraying the cost of the erection of such dwellings the Local Authority may borrow money as if such purpose were one of the purposes for which money may be borrowed under Sub-Section 2 of Section 46 of the Act. 7. Such of the lands in the area comprised in the scheme as shall not be required for the purpose of providing accommodation for persons of the working class as aforesaid shall be dedicated as a highway or open space. Art. II. We order that the provisions of the Lands Clauses Act shall be incorporated with this Order so as to enable the Local Authority to acquire compulsorily lands within the area comprised in the scheme. Given under the Seal of Office of the Local Government Board this day of , One thousand eight, hundred and ninety-eight. President. Asst. Secretary. 85 The Vestry, on 19th April, 1898, upon the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, passed the following resolution:— That to obviate the necessity of acquiring additional land and increasing the cost of carrying the scheme into execution, the block system of tenement dwellings be adopted and the Surveyor instructed to prepare a plan in accordance therewith and submit the same to the Committee when ready. On 21st June, 1898, the Sanitary Committee reported having considered the plan prepared by the Surveyor for covering the area with model dwellings, and the following report accompanying such plan:— As instructed, I beg to submit a plan for the erection of Working Class Dwellings upon the Fulford Street and Braddon Street insanitary area. The buildings to be erected in the form of a quadrangle formed by the streets bounding the area; to be four floors in height and divided by party walls into ten separate dwellings, the frontages varying from 85 feet to 60 feet and 36 feet in depth, outside measurements. They are so arranged as to admit of a free circulation of air around them. There are four entrances to the quadrangle, two for vehicular traffic and two for pedestrians only. Each dwelling has a separate entrance from the quadrangle and common staircase, giving access to the corridors and tenements right and left. There are in the ten dwellings 160 tenements, made up as follows:— No. of Rooms. 8 Four-roomed Tenements 32 68 Three-roomed Tenements 204 68 Two-roomed Tenements 136 16 One-roomed Tenements 16 Total No. of Rooms 388 The four-roomed tenements are arranged as a living room 13 feet by 12 feet, one bedroom 13 feet by 8 feet, and two bedrooms 12 feet 6 inches by 8 feet, each of the bedrooms being private and entered from the living room or passage. 86 The three-roomed tenements are arranged as a living room 13 feet by 12 feet, one large bedroom 15 feet by 8 feet, capable of being divided into two bedrooms by a movable screen, with separate entrances to each half, and one bedroom 13 feet by 8 feet. The two-roomed tenements are arranged as a living room 13 feet by 12 feet, and, except in three cases, upon each floor one bedroom 15 feet by 8 feet, capable of division as above described. In the excepted cases the bedroom is 13 feet by 8 feet. The one-roomed tenements are arranged as a living room and bedroom combined 13 feet by 12 feet. All the rooms to be 9 feet in height. There are ten staircases, one to each dwelling, the staircase openings being 8 feet in width. Entering from a lobby out of the corridors and adjacent to the sculleries, water closets slightly projecting beyond the main line of buildings are provided, two on each floor for the joint use of the four tenements; they are thoroughly disconnected from the tenements and have through ventilation. The dust and ashes on each floor would be disposed of through a ventilated shoot, formed in the angle of the lobby leading to the w.c., terminating in a receptacle placed in position on the ground floor; two connections in the corridors on each floor. Adjacent to the w.c.'s and leading from the corridor are the sculleries, each provided with a double sink, so that each tenant would have the exclusive use of one sink. In addition to the above accommodation each tenant would have the sole use for a fixed day of a laundry placed centrally on each floor, with two entrances from the corridors and intended for the use of the four tenements on the floor. By the proposed arrangements each tenant would have for the day the privacy that would attach to a laundry within his own tenement without any of the disadvantages arising from conducting washing operations therein. The quadrangle is laid out with a footway 6 feet wide and a carriage way of tar macadam 15 feet wide round the buildings, the central portion measuring 150 feet by 55 feet, being enclosed with an iron railing, with entrance gates on each side, in convenient positions. This enclosure could be laid out as a playground in cement or tar paving, or turfed, with a border of shrubs around the outer edge. 87 The dwellings (four floors only in height) will provide for a population of 800 persons at the least, consisting of about two-thirds adults and one-third children. Taking these figures, tho cubic space allotted to each person is considerably in excess of the amount required under the regulations, and in safety could be augmented without causing any overcrowding. I estimate the cost of the scheme as follows:— Buildings £42,000 0 0 Laying out Quadrangle 1,200 0 0 Value of land, as per Mr. Page's valuation 2,800 0 0 £46,000 0 0 Basing the rents to be charged the same as now charged by the London County Council for the tenements upon the Boundary Street area; — s. d. 4-roomed tenements 9 6 per week. 3 do. do. 7 6 do. 2 do. do. 5 6 do. 1 do. do. 3 0 do. which are exclusive of gas, but inclusive of all rates and taxes, the gross annual rental would amount to £2,620, which, after deducting for all leakages, such as rates, water, collection, repairs and empties, leaves a net return of 3½ per cent. on the estimated cost of the work. In judging the financial aspect of this scheme, it must be borne in mind that my object has not been to cover the site to its full capacity with dwellings, but to lay it out to the best advantage, at the same time providing a large breathing area in the centre of a dense population. If the estimated cost of this scheme (£46,000) was obtained on loan for a period of 50 years at the current rate of interest (27/8 per cent.) charged by the London County Council, the repayments of principal and interest upors the annuity system would amount to £1,730 per annum, which, if deducted from the gross estimated rental (£2,620 per annum), leaves £890 per annum for leakages, rates, etc., but in my calculations giving a net return of 3½ per cent. I have assumed that they will amount to £1,000 per annum; therefore, still adhering to the latter figures, the scheme shows, that to pay all current charges and repay the loan by in- 88 stalments, the proposed rents will not equal the expenditure by £110 per annum; but it must not be forgotten that you are for that amount gradually redeeming the principal of the loan or mortgage, and that at the end of 50 years, by a contribution of £110 per annum, or a total of £5,500, the whole of the freehold of land and buildings, without encumbrance, has been secured. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the plan prepared by the Surveyor for covering the area when cleared be approved and adopted, and a copy of such plan forwarded to the London County Council for their approval, and that consideration of the question as to who shall carry the Scheme into execution be deferred until a plan shall have been agreed upon by the London County Council. The before-mentioned plan having failed to satisfy the requirements of the London County Council, a second one was prepared, and On 17th January, 1899, the Sanitary Committee reported the Surveyor had failed to satisfy the views of the Medical Officer of Health and Architect of ihe London County Council by his second plan of proposed buildings to be???rected upon the Fulford Street and Braddon Street area when the existing houses should be demolished, and he had ascertained from the Local Government Board that it was useless to approach them until the Vestry and the Council were in agreement in the matter. Resolved [Rev. Canon Beck: Mr. Brown]—That it be an instruction to the Surveyor to submit to the Sanitary Committee at the earliest possible moment a further plan calculated to satisfy the requirements of the "Council. On 7th March, 1899, the Sanitary Committee reported with reference to the following report of the Surveyor:— I am pleased to be able to report that I have at last succeeded in preparing a plan for the laying out of the insanitary area which has been approved by the London County Council, the open quadrangle to be retained, the buildings to consist of 11 blocks, 5 stories in height, consisting of 110 3-roomed tenements, 30 2-roomed tenements, and 55 1-roomed tenements, with accommodation for 890 persons, being 340 persons more than at present upon the area 89 receipt of the following letter from the Council in connection with the matter: — Spring Gardens, S.W., 23rd February, 1899. Sir, Referring to the plans prepared by the Vestry of dwellings proposed to be erected on the Fulford Street and Braddon Street area, Rotherhithe, I am directed to inform you that the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Council at their meeting yesterday approved the plans. I am, however, to suggest that in executing the working drawings the Vestry might be able to improve the shape of the bedrooms, and to state that the approval of the Committee is subject to the Council being in no way responsible for any profit or loss that may result from the erection of the buildings in the event of their being erected by the Vestry. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, C. J. STEWART, Clerk of the Council. and Recommended that the Clerk forward a copy of the plan to the Local Government Board, and take all other necessary steps for obtaining- an order sanctioning the scheme prepared by the Vestry for dealing with the Fulford Street and Braddon Street Insanitary Area. Mr. Vezey drew attention to the following resolution adopted by the Council on 29th November, 1898:— That all clearances under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, which involve rehousing, be done at the sole cost of the Council. and suggested that before carrying out the recommendation of the Committee application should be made to the Council to bear the whole of the cost of clearing the area in question, in accordance with such resolution. After debate, Resolved [Mr. Vezey: Mr. Mortimer]—That application be made to the Council tu bear the whole cost of clearing the Fulford Street and Braddon Street Insanitary Area in accordance with the Council's resolution of 29th November, 1898. 90 Resolved [Mr. Stuart: Mr. Vezey]—That the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Council be asked to receive a deputation of 7 members in support of such application, and that the Clerk be and he is hereby instructed to prepare the necessary memorial in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Council. Resolved—That the deputation do consist of the undermentioned gentlemen:— Mr. F. J. Bisley, J.P., Chairman, Mr. Henry ATezey, Vice-Chairman, Rev. Canon Beck, M.A., Mr. W. Beasley, Mr. J. C. Higgs, Mr. J. C. Mortimer, and Mr. R. L. Stuart. \ Resolved—That the recommendation of the Committee be approved, subject, however, to the action to be taken by the London County Council in respect to the before-mentioned application. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. improvements. Rotherbithe Street. On 7th February, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported, with reference to the suggested improvement, Rotherhithe Street, opposite St. Joseph's Training Home, Ino. 654, that the Surveyor reported as under: — I have received a letter and sketch on behalf of the owners of St. Joseph's Training Home, "St. Pelagius," Rotherhithe Street, stating that they contemplate doing up and repairing the front of the Home, and suggesting that this would be a favourable opportunity for the Vestry to widen the footpath in front of the premises, which is now only 2 feet 6 inches in width. The 91 owners are willing to give up a strip of land, about 3 feet 6 inches in width, 68 feet long, 238 square feet in area, if the Vestry will alter the existing steps to the home and erect a new fence wall, with gateway entrance, along a portion of the frontage, 41 feet long and 7 feet in height. I submit the matter for your consideration, and suggest that it be referred to a Committee to view and report: and, having inspected the premises, it was Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Yestry offer the owners a sum of £40 for the land in lieu of carrying' out the work suggested, and that, if accepted, the land be conveyed at the Vestry's expense. On 21st February, 1899, the Committee reported receipt of the following report of the Surveyor:— 1 communicated the offer of the Yestry of £40 for the 26½ yards of land to effect an improvement at St. Pelagius' Home, 654 Rotherhithe Street, to the representative of the owners, who has been to see me in reference to the matter and states that they have had an estimate for carrying out the alterations which amounts to £60. Whilst admitting that the improvement will to some extent also benefit the property, the owners are not prepared to pay the difference of £20, but if the Yestry would increase their offer to £50 it would be accepted. He also desired me to mention that the work carried on at the Home is entirely one of charity, so that any money taken from the funds would be to the detriment of the work undertaken. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Yestry's offer be increased to £50. Lighting. Hickling Street. On 6th September, 1898, the Yestry resolved to fix an additional lamp in line with Matson Street and to alter the position of existing lamp to opposite No. 5. Rotherhithe Street. On 19th April, 1898, the Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes and Works Committee—That the existing bracket lamp on the fence between Nos. 252 92 and 254 be moved find re-fixed on the wall of No. 254, and an additional bracket lamp provided and fixed half-way between the bracket lamp before-mentioned and the next lamp to the west of the street. Silverlock Street and Westlake Road. On 19th April, 1898, the Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes and Works Committee—That two additional lamps be provided and fixed in Silverlock Street and one in Westlake Road, and the existing lamps in such roads rearranged, it necessary, at the discretion of the Surveyor.

The following is a copy of the Vestry's Petition: — County of London and Brush Provincial In Parliament, Electric Lighting Company, Limited. House of Commons, Session 1899. Petition against. To the Honourable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of Rotnerhithe in the Administrative County of London, under their Common Seal. SHEWETH: 1. A Bill has been introduced and is now pending in your Honourable House, intituled "A Bill to authorise the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, to purchase lands and construct generating stations, and for other purposes." 2. The Preamble of the Bill recites intefr alia as follows: — Whereas the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, are, by the Orders mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Bill, authorised to supply electricity in various districts and parishes within the Administrative County of London, and under the provisions of such Orders are now supplying electricity, and the Company have made applications to the Board of Trade for Provisional Orders extending their area of supply. 104 And whereas the demand for electricity within the said Districts and Parishes has largely increased and is increasing, and it is expedient that the Company be authorised to erect and work Stations for generating electricity upon the lands described in the First Schedule to the Bill, and to acquire such lands or rights and interests therein. And whereas districts, or property over which the Company have no powers, in some cases intervene between different portions of the areas supplied and proposed to be supplied by the Company, and that it is expedient that the Company be empowered to lay down and maintain electric lines for the purpose of transmitting energy from any such generating Station as aforesaid, to any portion of their area of supply as for the time being existing. 3. The Second Schedule referred to in the Preamble is as follows:— The Southwark Electric Lighting Order, 1892, the County of London (North Electric Lighting Order, 1892, the Wandsworth Electric Lighting Order, 1892, the St. Olave Electric Lighting Order, 1895, scheduled to and confirmed by the Electric Lighting Orders Confirmation (Notting Hill, etc.), Act, 1896, the Camberwell Electric Lighting Order, 1896, the St. Saviour's District Electric Lighting Order, 1896, the County of London (East) Electric Lighting Order, 1897, the County of London (Northern Extensions) Electric Lighting Order, 1897, and the Holborn and St. Giles Electric Lighting Order, 1898 (No. 1). 4. By Clause 11 of the Bill the Company is empowered, for the purpose of connecting portions of the districts within their area of supply with the generating stations which the Company are by the Bill authorised to erect or one of them lay down, maintain, use, repair, remove, renew, and alter electric lines within their area of supply and within the Parish of Rotherhitne and other parishes, and may utilise such electric lines for the transmission of electric current or energy accordingly, and may, for the purpose of laying down, maintaining, using, repairing, renewing, and altering such electric lines, and of examining, testing, regulating, measuring, and controlling the supply or transmission of electricity through the same, and examining or testing the state thereof, open and break up the soil and pavement in the several streets within such parish, and any mains, pipes, sewers, drains, etc., therein or thereunder, and may remove and use the earth and materials in and under any streets so broken up, and do all such other acts as they shall from time to time deem necessary for such purposes. 105 5. By Clause 15 of the Bill the Company is empowered to make one annual statement of account only in respect of all the undertakings authorised by any Orders or Acts of Parliament relating to Districts within the Administrative County of London and conferring powers upon the Company for the supply of electricity therein, instead of a separate statement of account in respect of each undertaking. 6. Your Petitioners are the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe in the Administrative County of London, incorporated under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, with a population and rateable value of over 40,000 people and 216,000 pounds respectively, and possess jurisdiction for the purposes of that and numerous other Acts within the said parish. 7. Your Petitioners allege that it is unnecessary and inexpedient that the provisions of the Bill should pass into law and they strongly object thereto for the reasons hereafter appearing:— 8. The County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, are at present empowered to supply thirteen Metropolitan parishes or districts, and are applying to the Board of Trade for the grant of Provisional Orders under the Electric Lighting Acts in respect to thirteen other parishes or districts, including the Parish of Rotherhithe, and by the provisions of the Bill are endeavouring to convert their present separate undertakings and any undertakings which they may acquire in future, into one gigantic concern, thus practically rendering futile Section 2 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, which provides for the purchase of Companies' undertakings by Local Authorities and the special purchase clauses which have been inserted from time to time in the various Provisional Orders granted to the Company. 9. The provision in the Bill enabling the Company to render one statement of account only in respect of all their undertakings, instead of a separate one for each, as provided for by Section 9 of the Electric Lighting Act, 18S2, is, in the opinion of your Petitioners, a vicious one, inasmuch as it will be practically impossible to arrive at a basis for purchase in respect to any one parish or district, and, taken with the fact that several areas would be supplied from one large generating station, instead of each area being supplied from its own station, will practically prevent Local Authorities from exercising their rights of purchase. 106 10. The Parish of Rotherhithe, like other Metropolitan Parishes, is constantly having its roads and footpaths disturbed by Gas and Water Companies and others in the laying of pipes and mains, which is a source of obstruction and danger to traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, the rating of which pipes, mains, etc., in the opinion of your Petitioners, is not a sufficient quid pro quo for the advantages obtained, and they feel that the time has now arrived when valuable indiscriminate powers should not be granted to trading Companies and others to pull up and disturb the roads and footpaths of the Metropolis, unless some very good and just reason can be shown for so doing, and not in the latter case unless proper provision is made for equitably compensating the Parish or District affected. 11. The Company have on previous occasions applied for your Petitioners' consent to their application to the Board of Trade for the grant of a Provisional Order in respect to the Parish of Rotherhithe, as required by Section 1 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1888, which consent your Petitioners have withheld for (he reason that one Company, viz., "The London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited," already holds an Order for the Parish, and is laying down mains therein for the supply of electricity, and your Petitioners are considering as to the advisability of applying for an Order themselves in respect to the supply of electricity within the Parish. 12. The Company, however, has dispensed with the consent of your Petitioners, and at the present time is making a fresh application to the Board of Trade, to which your Petitioners have lodged objections, and they anticipate that their objections will sufficiently weigh with the Board to induce them to refuse the application. 13. For these and many other reasons your Petitioners strongly object to the Bill, and say that it is not in the public interest that the powers sought by the Bill should be conferred upon the Company, but, on the contrary, as the Bill seeks to create a huge monopoly, which your Honourable House have by the provisions of the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888 sought to destroy any idea of. 14. That the Preamble of the Bill is not true and is incapable of proof so far as the Parish of Rotherhithe is concerned. 107 Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray your Honourable House that the Bill may not be allowed to pass into law; but, if the Bill do pass, that a clause or clauses may be inserted therein providing for their protection as to your Honourable House shall seem meet. The Common Seal of tne Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe in the Administrative County of London, affixed by Order this twenty-first day of February, 1899, in the presence of E. CARR OLIVIER, Assistant Clerk to the Vestry. The Preamble of the Bill was not proved. The Common Seal of the Vestry of the Parish ef Rotherhithe. London County Council (Westminster Bridge and Victoria Embankment Tramways) Bill, On 3rd May-, 1898, the Vestry passed a resolution approving the Bill, which empowers the Council to extend the tramway system across Westminster Bridge and along the Victoria Embankment. The second reading, however, was put off for six months. Shops Bill. On 3rd May, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported, with reference to a letter from the Vestry Clerk of Limehouse, stating that that Vestry had had under consideration a Bill introduced into Parliament this Session to amend the law relating to shops, and, being of opinion that the proposed Bill would be most injurious to the interests of the ratepayers engaged in retail trades had passed a resolution requesting that the Parliamentary representative of that district be urged to oppose the said Bill in Parliament, and that 108 a copy of such resolution be forwarded to the Home Secretary pointing out the great inconvenience it will cause to the public and the serious loss to the shopkeepers if the Bill becomes law. That the Bill provides inter alia for the compulsory closing of shops. The Yestry Resolved to support the action taken by the Vestry of Limoliouse in the matter. On 17th May, 1898, in accordance with notice given at the previous meeting, Mr. Stuart moved that the before-mentioned resolution be rescinded. The motion having been seconded by the Rev. Canon Beck, was put to the meeting, when the same was carried by the requisite majority of two-thirds the members present, and resolved accordingly. On 7th June, 1898, the Yestry passed a resolution in favour of the Bill. The second reading of the Bill was dropped. Metropolis Water. On 1st November, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the above Bill, prepared by Mr. Harry S. Samuel, M.P., to amend the Metropolis Water Act, 1871, that it is a Bill providing inter alia for the compulsory connection of the mains and pipes of any one or more of the Metropolitan Water Companies to the mains and pipes of any one or more of the said Companies as may seem necessary to the Local Government Board, under a penalty for default of £200, and to a further penalty of <£100 weekly during the continuance of such default. The Yestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, to approve of the provisions of the Bill. The second reading, however, was dropped. 109 South Eastern Railway Company's Bill. On 17th January, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the map and notice of the intention of the South-Eastern Railway Company to apply to Parliament in the ensuing Session for leave to bring in a Bill for inter alia the following purposes: — Railway (No. 1), commencing in the Parish of St. Paul, Deptford, by a junction with the Company's main line at a point 150 yards or thereabouts from the centre of the bridge which carries the said railway over Edward Street, measured in a north-westerly direction along the said line, and terminating in the Parish of St. Mary, Rotherhithe, by a junction with the Company's main line at a point 113 yards or thereabouts from the centre of the signal-box known as Corbett's Lane signal-box, measured in a north-westerly direction along the said railway.

Shuttleworth and Co., and letter from the Chief Engineer, London County Council, asking to he informed of the nature of any objections the Yestry may have to the above scheme— 110 that it affects property in the Parish to the extent of £759 rateable value, but does not otherwise very materially affect the Parish. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee: — 1. That, subject to the Company agreeing to the insertion of the following clauses in the Bill for the protection of the Vestry and entering into an undertaking for that purpose no further action be taken in the matter. 2. That the Chief Engineer of the London County Council be informed of the action proposed to be taken in the matter. Proposed clauses.

On 21st February 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the South-Eastern Railway Company's Bill in Parliament that the Company were practically unwilling to agree to the insertion therein of any of the clauses proposed for the protection of the Yestry. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Yestry petition against the Bill, and that Messrs. Roberts and Chubb, Parliamentary agents, be instructed accordingly. The Clerk reported that he had since received a letter from the Secretary of the Company upon the subject of the proposed 40 ft. bridge over White Pest Lane. Resolved—That the letter be referred to the General Purposes and Works Committee for consideration and report. On 7th March, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported, with reference to the South-Eastern Railway Company's Bill in Parliament, receipt of a letter from the Solicitor to the Bill, forwarding copy letter from the Company's Engineer relative to 113 the Vestry's requirement that the Bill should provide that the abutments of the bridge over White Tost Lane should have a clear span of not less than 40 feet, as under: — South-eastern and London, Chatham, and Dover Railways Managing Committee. London Bridge Station, S.E., 17th February, 1899. Dear Sir, Referring to the request of tnis Yestry for a bridge forty feet wide over the occupation road and public footpath known as White Post Lane, I beg to say that as the road is close to where the new railway would cross the Bricklayers' Arms Branch it would be an impossibility to give them what they ask for as there would not be sufficient room between the two bridges for the abutments ; consequently they would have to be thrown into one, which would entail an enormous expense. A bridge, however, of about 25 feet span would leave room for the necessary supports between the two bridges. Yours truly, P. C. TEMPEST, J. W. Watkin, Esq. The Committee did not consider that the expense should stand in the way of a 40 feet span, and Recommended that the Yestry adhere to their previous decision in the matter. Resolved—That the same be approved. The matter was proceeding at the close of the year. National Telephone Company's Bills 1 and 2, and Telegraph Act, 1892, Amendment Bill. On 21st February, 1899, the Yestry had before them a letter, dated Tth February, 1899, from the Yestry Clerk of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, stating that that Arestry had requested the London County Council and the City Corporation to oppose the passing into law of the 114 National Telephone Company's Bills Nos. 1 and 2, and the Telegraph Act (1392) Amendment Bill, and inquiring whether this Yestry would co-operate with that Yestry in the same course of action and in the like direction: and also a letter dated 8th February. 1899, from the Vestry Clerk of St. Luke, Middlesex, stating that that Yestry had decided that each of the before-mentioned Bills should be stoutly opposed, forwarding copy letter addressed to the Clerk of the London County Council, and asking to be informed whether this Yestry approved of that Vestry's views upon the matter. Resolved [Dr. Hall: Mr. Beasley]—That this Vestry support the action taken by the Vestries of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. Luke, Middlesex, upon the subject. London Government Bill. On 7th March, 1899, the Vestry had under consideration the provisions of the above Bill, when the following resolutions were passed: — Resolved—That the Vestry disapproves of the Bill, as it feels that it will be detrimental to the interests of London in general if passed into law. Resolved—That a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded to the member of Parliament for the Division, with a request that he will do all in his power in opposition to the measure. Paving. Lower Road. On 3rd July, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported, with reference to the question of the paving of Lower Road in front of the Town Hall with wood, receipt of a letter from the Secretary to the London, Deptford, and Greenwich Tramways Company, stating that the Directors regretted they were unable, to agree to the Vestry's request that they should pave their portion, viz., inside the rails and three feet on either side, with wood. 115 Resolved—That the Directors be asked to bear the cost of paving inside the rails only, and in that case the Yestry bear the cost of the remainder of the work, without prejudice, however, to the Company's liability in the matter of maintenance both inside and outside the rails. This the Company agreed to do, and the Surveyor was instructed on 6th September, 1898, to carry out the work. Precepts.

On 20th December, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to a letter from the Hon. Secretary, London Butchers' Trade Society, enclosing copy petition of the Committee of the London Central Meat and Poultry Markets Association to the London County Council, praying that the Council will take into consideration the representations contained in such petition, and will refrain from taking any steps to establish public slaughterhouses or to suppress private slaughterhouses; the letter from the Secretary, London Chamber of Commerce, forwarding copy letter addressed by the Meat and Cattle Trade Section of that Chamber to the London County Council in opposition to the abolition of private slaughterhouses; and the letter from the Yestry Clerk of Clerkenwell, stating that that 116 Vestry had had under consideration the question of the proposal which is before the London County Council to abolish private slaughterhouses and establish public abattoirs under its own control, and had decided to strongly protest against such proposal.

Chandler to purchase 15 Cathay Street for the sum of £100. The premises, it will be remembered, were purchased for the purpose of utilising them as a temporary shelter, but were subsequently deemed unsatisfactory, and other premises were built at the Yestry's Wharf in Rotherhithe Street. Sub-section 4 of Section GO enacts that a Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants, for the members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Sanitary Authority.

Complaint having been received of the erection by a Mr. Hollway of a campshed in front of the above Right-of-Way, the following correspondence has taken place with the Thames Conservancy and the Board of Trade: — Town Hall, Lower Road, S.E., 3rd February, 1898. Sir, It has been reported to the Yestry that Mr. John Hollway, of Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, has constructed a raised Campshedding upon the foreshore of the river in front of the right-of-way between his premises and Messrs. Burt, Boulton and Haywood's premises, and is using the frontage for the repairing of barges ; and I am directed to draw the attention of the Board to the matter. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. James H. Gough, Esq., Secretary, Thames Conservancy, Thames Conservancy, Victoria Embankment, E.C. 1st March, 1898. Sir, I have laid before the Conservators of (he River Thames your letter of the 3rd ultimo, stating that Mr. Hollway has placed a Campshedding on the foreshore in front of a rightof-way between Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, and the premises of Messrs. Burt, Boulton, and Haywood, and is repairing barges there. In reply I am directed to state that the Conservators have granted permission for the Campshed, but there is no desire on their part to interfere with the right-of-way to the river. Indeed, they understand that what Mr. Hollway has done is rather an improvement, and that by removing an accumulation of mud there and filling in the berth with hard core, landing and embarking at the place will be rendered more easy. With the object, however, of 119 ensuring that there shall be no obstruction the Conservators have informed Mr. Hollway that any barges repaired at the spot must be so placed that there shall be no interference with the right-of-way. Instructions to this effect have also been given to the Harbour Master. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, The Clerk, JAMES H. GOUGH. Rotherhithe Yestry. Town Hall, Lower Road, S.E., 17th March, 1898. Sir, I submitted your letter of the 1st inst., stating (in reply to my letter of 3rd February) that the Conservators have granted permission to Mr. Hollway for the erection of the Campshed in front of the right-of-way to the river between Trinity Wharf and the premises of Messrs. Burt, Boulton and Haywood and that they understand what has been done will render landing and embarking more easy, but have given instructions that there shall be no interference with such right-of-way, to the Yestry at their last meeting, when I was directed to state that, in the opinion of the Yestry, the erection of a Campshed immediately in front of a public right-of-way is an interference, and may be a source of danger to barges through the possibility of their getting half on and half off the Campshed ; and that therefore the Yestry can take no responsibility in the matter, but will look to the Conservators to do so. I am also directed to enquire the authority that enables the Conservators to grant privileges that interfere to a certain extent with a public right-of-way, without first communicating with the Local Authority upon the subject. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. The Secretary, Thames Conservancy. • Thames Conservancy; Victoria Embankment, E.C. 28th March, 1898. Sir, I have laid before the Conservators of the River Thames your letter of the 17th inst., stating that the Rotherhithe Vestry consider the Campshed placed by Mr. Hollway across the dock adjoining his premises, Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, in front of the public right-of-way may be a source of danger to barges, and that the Vestry can take no responsibility in the matter. 120 In reply, I am desired to point out that the Campshed is 97 feet out from the public way, and any barge lying in front of it could easily be moved away when required, should occation arise. The Harbour Master states that as a matter of fact barges could not approach tne rightof-way until there is ample depth of water over the Campshed, but, by way of precaution, Mr. Hollway has been requested to place a notice-board to indicate the position of the Campshed. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES 11. GOUGH. The Clerk to the Yestry of Rotherhithe, Lower Road, S.E. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 7th April, 1898. Sir, Referring to the previous correspondence, and to your letter of 28th March, relative to the Campshed placed by Mr. Hollway in front of a public right-of-way in this parish, I am directed by the Yestry to protest against Mr. Hollway being enabled to practically block a public right-of-way without any application having been made to the Yestry in the matter, and to again respectfully enquire the authority that enables the Conservators to grant privileges that interfere to a certain extent with a public right-of-way without first communicating with the Local Authority upon the subject, which question you apparently overlooked in your letter of 28th March, 1898. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, The Secretary ; Clerk to the Yestry. Thames Conservancy. Thames Conservancy; Solicitor's Department, Victoria Embankment, 22nd April, 1898. Sir, The Conservators of the River Thames have desired me to reply to your letter of the 7th inst. with reference to the permission recently granted by them to Mr. J. Hollway to campshed and level the foreshore at the entrance to the barge dock adjoining his premises, Trinity 121 Wharf, Rotherhithe. In reply to your enquiry as to the Conservators' powers in the matter, I would point out that the bed, soil and shores of the river up to ordinary high-water mark are vested in the Conservators, and they are empowered by the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894 (57 and 58 Vic., cap. clxxxvii.) to grant permission for works to be constructed therein and thereon. In this case the Conservators are advised that the work they have sanctioned is an improvement to that particular part of the river, and is in no way an interference with the public right-of-way referred to in your communications, as claimed by the Vestry. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, J AMES HUGHES. J. J. Stokes, Esq., Clerk to the Rotherhithe Vestry, Town Hall, Lower Road, S.E. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 4th May, 1898. Sir, Referring to the correspondence that has taken place with the Secretary to the Board, and to your letter of 22nd April last, upon the above subject, I have to inform you that from a perusal of the Act referred to by you, and also of the Act of 1857, I do not find that the Conservators are empowered to grant permission to an owner of land fronting the river to erect works in front of the land of an adjoining owner; and I am directed to state that the Vestry are not at all satisfied that the Conservators have the powers claimed by you, viz., granting permission to an adjoining owner to erect works in front of a public right-of-way, and that they must adhere to their previous opinion that the erection of the Campshed in question is an interference with the rights of the Vestry as custodians of such right-of-way, and unless the Conservators see their way to acknowledge the rights of the Vestry in the matter, or provide another landing place in lieu of the one obstructed, they propose to ask for an expression of opinion from the Board of Trade. I am, Sir, your obedient servant JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. James Hughes, Esq., Solicitor, Thames Conservancy, 122 Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 16th May, 1898. Sir, Referring to my letter to you of the 4th inat. relative to the above subject, I enclose you herewith copy of a letter received from a Mr. R. W. Thorndyke, Lighterman, of 37 Culling Road, Rotherhithe, for the information of the Conservators. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. James Hughes, Esq., Solicitor, Thames Conservancy. Copy of letter enclosed:— 37 Culling Road, Rotherhithe, S.E., May 10th, 1898. Gentlemen, I beg to call your attention to the right-of-way alongside Messrs. Burt, Boulton's Wharf, Rotherhithe, as Messrs. Hollway and Co.'s foreman barge builder keeps a barge locked in there, and will not shift the barge without Mr. Hollway's orders to do so. Your attention to the same will oblige, Yours truly, R. W. THORNDYKE. To the Rotherhithe Vestry. Thames Conservancy Solicitor's Department, Victoria Embankment, 26th May, 1898. Sir, The Conservators of the River Thames have had under consideration your letters of the 4th and 16th inst. The Conservators cannot admit that the Campshed interferes with the approach to the right-of-way, of which the Vestry claim to be custodians, but, on the contrary, they are advised that the work sanctioned is an improvement, and does not obstruct in any way landing at the place in question. 123 The Conservators must leave the Vestry to take whatever steps in the matter they may think proper, but with regard to the statement in your letter—that the Yestry propose to ask for an expression of opinion from the Board of Trade, I am desired to inform the Yestry that the plans of the Campshed were approved by the Board of Tirade before sanction was given by the Conservators for the work. With reference to your letter of the 16th inst., enclosing copy of a communication received by the Yestry from Mr. Thorndyke, complaining that access to the right-of-way was blocked by a barge belonging to Mr. Hollway, I have to inform you that the Harbour Master has been directed to take such steps as may be necessary to prevent barges being so placed in front of the right-of-way as to interfere with it, and this will be done. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES HUGHES. James J. Stokes, Esq. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 10th June, 1898. Sir, By direction of the Vestry of this Parish, I beg to enclose you herewith copy correspondence which has taken place between the Thames Conservancy, Mr. John Hollway, of Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, and the Vestry, relative to the construction of a Campshed immediately in front of the public right-of-way adjoining the Wharf, and to respectfully request the Board to favour the Vestry with an expression of opinion as to the powers of the Thames Conservancy to grant permission to an owner of premises abutting upon the River Thames to erect works in front of the premises of an adjoining owner without obtaining his permission. Awaiting the favour of your reply, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry. Sir Courtenay Boyle, Iv.C.B, Board of Trade, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 124 Board of Trade (Harbour Department), 7 Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W., 27th June, 1898. Sir, With further reference to your letter of the 10th inst., in which you transmit copy of correspondence which has passed between the Vestry of Rotherhithe and the Conservators of the River Thames upon the subject of a Campshed which has been constructed by Mr. John Hollway in front of a public right-of-way adjoining Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state for the information of the Vestry that plans of the work in question were submitted by the Conservators for the approval of this department in accordance with the provisions of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894, and received the approval of the Board of Trade on the 11th October last. I am at the same time to inform you that the Board of Trade are not prepared to express any opinion as to the powers of the Conservators in approving works such as the one now in question, and I am to add that with their present information the Board are not disposed to consider the Campshed as otherwise than a local improvement. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, T. H. W. PELHAM. The Clerk to the Vestry of Rotherhithe, Lower Road, S.E. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 7th July, 1898. Sir, I submitted your favour of 27th June, 1898, in this matter to the Vestry at their last meeting, when I was directed to express the Vestry's extreme regret that the Board of Trade are not prepared to give any opinion as to the powers of the Conservators, inasmuch as the Vestry feel they have a grievance which, in the absence of the intervention of the Board, it is impossible to have righted without recourse to the law, and to enquire whether the Board, when approving the plans for the Campshed, were aware that the Vestry's sanction thereto had not been given, and that they were, in fact, ignorant of the whole matter until the Campshed had been completed, and whether the Board would sanction the construction of works in front of the land abutting the river against the wishes of the owner of such land. I am also to say, in answer to your statement that the Board look upon the Campshed as a local improvement, that, in the opinion of the Vestry, the same is a source of great danger to barges coming alongside, and that they are already in receipt of complaints that the 125 right-of-way is being obstructed by Mr. Hollway, to whom the Thames Conservancy have granted these extraordinary privileges in defiance and without the sanction of the Yestry, and to express the hope that the Board may see its way to give an opinion in the matter of the rights of the Thames Conservancy to sanction the construction of works by an adjoining owner in front of land abutting upon the river in defiance and without the sanction of the owner thereof. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Yestry. The Assistant Secretary., (Harbour Department) Board of Trade. Board of Trade (Fisheries and Harbour Department), 7 Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W., 6th August, 1898. Sir, With further reference to your letter of the 7th ult., upon 'the subject of a Campshed which has been constructed upon certain foreshore of the River Thames at Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, by Mr. John Hollway, and which extends in front of a public right-of-way to the river, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state for the information of the Yestry of Rotherhithe that applications for permission to erect works upon the bed or shores of the river do not come before the Board until the consent of the Conservators has been obtained, and that as the bed and shores are not under the charge of this Department the Board consider that their jurisdiction under the Act is practicaly limited to the possible effect of such works upon the general navigation of the river. In any case, it does not devolve upon the Board to go into the effect of the works upon the property of adjoining owners, unless their attention has been particularly called to the matter. I am further to observe that in the letter addressed to you on 26th May last by the Solicitor to the Conservators it is stated that the Harbour Master has been directed to take such steps as may be necessary to prevent barges being placed in front of the right-of-way so as to interfere with its use by the public. 126 Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the Board do not consider that the complaint of the Vestry is a matter in which they have any grounds for interference. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, The Clerk, COSMO MONKHOUSE. Vestry of Rotherhithe, Town Hall, Lower Road, S.E. Town Hall, Lower Road, S.E., 9th August, 1898. Sir, Referring to your letter of the 6th instant, I am not quite clear as to the meaning of the following paragraph contained therein : — "In any case it does not devolve upon the Board to go into the effect of the work3 upon the property of adjoining owners unless their attention is particularly called to the matter." The Vestry, as adjoining owners, have particularly called the attention of the Board to the matter of the erection of the Campshed, and therefore I shall be glad to be informed of the exact meaning of the paragraph before referred to. Thanking you in anticipation, I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, The Assistant Secretary., Clerk to the Vestry. (Fisheries and Harbour Department) Board of Trade. Board of Trade (Fisheries and Harbour Department), 7 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 24th August, 1898. Sir, With further reference to your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the Campshed which has been constructed by Mr. John Hollway at Trinity Wharf, Rotherhithe, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state for the information of the Vestry of Rotherhithe that the paragraph you quote from the Board's letter of the 6th inst. (F. and H. 7896) refers (to the time when plans of works on the foreshores of the River Thames are submitted to the Board for their statutory approval. 127 In the case of Trinity "Wharf the Board received no communication from the Vestry until some months after the approval had been given. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, FRANCIS J. S. HOPWOOD. The Clerk to the Vestry of Rotherhithe, Lower Road, S.E. Town Hall, Rotherhithe, S.E., 25th August, 1898. Sir, I am in receipt of your favour of 24th inst., in reply too mine of the 9th inst., stating that the paragraph quoted from the Board's letter of the 6th inst. refers to the time when plans of works on the foreshore of the River Thames are submitted to the Board for their statutory approval, and that in the above matter the Board received no communication from the Vestry until some months after the approval had been given. This is perfectly true, and the reason is that the Vestry were not aware that works were being erected in front of their property until the works had been completed, when they immediately protested to the Conservators against the apparently high-handed way in which they were being treated in the matter, but without result. They then applied, as you know, to the Board, but again apparently without result. The Vestry are of opinion that they are not being properly treated in this matter, inasmuch as they had no opportunity given them in any shape or form of opposing the application when the plans of the works were submitted to the Board for their statutory approval, as they knew nothing about it, no notice having been given them of the proposed application, and I am to enquire whether the omission of the service of a notice upon the Vestry was an oversight on some one's part, or whether it is customary for the Board to deal with applications for the construction of works on the foreshore of the river in front of property abutting thereon without the sanction or cognisance of the owner thereof. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, JAMES J. STOKES, Clerk to the Vestry, The Assistant Secretary., (Fisheries and Harbour Department) Board of Trade, 128 Board of Trade (Fisheries and Harbour Department), 7 Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 2Gth September, 1898. Sir, With further reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, upon the subject of the Campshed which has been constructed by Mr. .John Hollway at Trinity Wharf, Botherhithe, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state that, as their functions in regard to works on the bed or shores of the River Thames under Section 182 of the Thames Conservancy Act, 1894, only have reference to the possible effect of new works upon the general navigation of the river, the Board do not feel that they can usefully add anything to the previous correspondence. I am, Sir, your obedient servant, The Clerk; Vestry of Botherhithe. , T. H. W. PELHAM. On 4th October, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported that they did not feel that the matter was one that the Vestry should incur any expense about by obtain- 9 ing Counsel's opinion or otherwise. -The Vestry therefore resolved that no further action be taken in the matter, but that Mr. Holloway be required to place a notice board indicating the position of the campshed. The notice board has been erected. Grice's Wharf. On 21st March, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the following report of the Surveyor:— Beceiving a complaint that the right of way adjoining Grice's Wharf, Kotherhithe Street, was in a dirty condition by reason of persons using it as a urinal, I have had the same thoroughly cleansed, but the owners of the wharf now ask "to prevent it being used as a public urinal, etc., at night, would the Vestry erect a high gate at the street entrance, and they would undertake to look after the same and keep it locked at night." There are no public stairs at this right of way, and a gate exists at present at the river end, the key for which is in possession of the owners of Grice's Wharf. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee—That a gate be erected at the street entrance as suggested, and a key left at Grice's Wharf. 129 Staff. Clerk's Department. On 3rd May, 1898, Mr. H. J. Smith, of 198 Potherhithe Street, was appointed Messenger, and to make himself generally useful in the Clerk's Department, at a weekly wage of 10s. On 21st June, 1898, the Yestry authorised the payment to the Hallkeeper of an extra 2s. 6d. per week, to enable him to engage the services of a woman one clay weekly to assist in the cleansing of the various rooms of the building. On 6th September, 1898, the Vestry, upon the application of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, approved of the proposal to pay a wage of 38s. weekly, with house, coals, and gas, to the newly-appointed Engineer, William Anderson. On 20th September, 1898, the Vestry resolved to increase the salary of the Assistant Vestry Clerk (Mr. E. C. Olivier) to £280 per annum. On 20th September, 1898, the Vestry resolved to increase the wages of the Assistant Hallkeeper to 30s. per week. On 20th December, 1898, upon the application of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, the Yestry approved of the proposal to increase the salary of the Superintendent by £20 per annum. On 21st June, 1898, the Yestry resolved to sanction the proposal of the Batlis Commissioners to grant a superannuation allowance amounting to 21s. per week to Thomas Austin, the Engineer. Surveyor's Department. On 17th May, 1898, the Clerk submitted a report by the Surveyor that J. Hall, one of the Yestry's Poad Sweepers, who had for some time been absent upon sick pay, had died since the last meeting of the Yestry, leaving a family. 130 Resolved—That a cheque for the sum of £10 be drawn in favour of the widow as a gratuity towards the funeral expenses. On 21st June, 1898, the wages of the Drainage Inspector (P. Walsh) were increased by 5s. per week. On Gth September, 1898, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported the resignation of Mr. A. Maclean, the Time and Store-keeper at the Wharf, and the Vestry resolved to issue advertisements inviting applications for the post. On 1st November, 1898, Mr. Charles Leather, of 17 Brading Road, Brixton Hill, S.W., was appointed Time and Store-keeper at the Vestry's Wharf, Rotherhithe Street, at a wage of 30s. per week, with house, gas and coals, subject to his residing in the house provided, to his devoting the whole of his time to the duties of the office, and to a month's notice beinng given on either side. On Gth December, 1898, the wages of the Sweepers were increased from 25s. to 27s. per week, the wages of the Gangers with Sweepers from 27s. to 29s. per week, and the wages of the Steam Roller Driver from 35s. to 38s. per week. Sanitary Department. On 19th April, 1898, a gratuity of £20 was granted to Mr. Corkburn, Sanitary Inspector, Southern District. On 7th February, 1899, the salary of Mr. Sanderson, Sanitary Clerk, was increased to £85 a year. 131 Surrey Commercial Docks Extension. Steps, Yeoman Street. On 7th February, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to a memorial praying for the erection of a flight of steps leading from Plough Bridge to the vacant piece of land adjacent thereto, opposite the junction of Chilton Street and Yeoman Street, having had submitted to them the following report of the Surveyor:— As instructed, I have been in communication with the Secretary and Engineer of the Surrey Commercial Dock Company in reference to the erection of a flight of steps from Yeoman Street to New Road No. 2, and to the Engineer I sent a plan defining the proposal, suggesting a site immediately opposite the footway upon the north, side of Chilton Street, or, as an alternative, a site adjoining the present houses at the south end of the piece of land. He informs me that he has placed the matter before his Directors, who suggest, in order to avoid cutting up their property, that they occupy the apex of the triangle at the north end of the ground. If the Yestry considers this a satisfactory position, I have reason to believe it will have the favourable consideration of the Company, but the saving in distance, instead of going round, will only amount to 103 yards, 23 yards less than if placed in the centre and 55 yards less than the site at the south end. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Surveyor be instructed to negotiate with the Company for the site adjoining the present houses at the south end of the piece of land. The matter remained at this stage at the close of the year. Widening of Commercial Dock Road. On 7th June, 1898, the Vestry resolved that the Clerk submit the matter of the proposed widening of a portion of Commercial Dock Road to the Council, with a copy of the correspondence between the Dock Company and the Vestry, and copy plan and estimated cost of widening, including purchase of land, etc., with the view of the improvement being 132 carried out as a Metropolitan one, and the Council making a contribution towards the cost. On 7th February, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the letter from the Clerk, London County Council, stating, in reply to the Vestry's letter of 14th July, 1898, asking for a contribution towards the cost of widening Commercial Dock Road between Lady Dock Bridge and the new swing bridge over the entrance to Russia Dock, that it appeared to the Council that the widening of the road in the manner proposed would form an incomplete improvement unless arrangements were made for the widening of Lady Dock Bridge, that the Council had resolved, subject to the Vestry arranging for the reconstruction of the bridge, to contribute one-half of the net cost of the widening of the road as shown upon the plan, such contribution not to exceed the sum of £750, and enclosing copy of conditions upon which the contribution was made, Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Clerk write and inform the Council that the Vestry is quite aware that the improvement will be to a certain extent incomplete unless Lady Dock Bridge is widened, and intends, when the said bridge requires renewing, to negotiate for the widening thereof, but at the present moment it is only dealing with the portion of Commercial Dock Road which, under the Company's Act of 1894, is to be raised 10 feet, and that unless arrangements are made to widen the road before the work of raising is commenced, the opportunity to effect a most important improvement will be lost to the parish for ever; and urging the Council to withdraw the condition for the reconstruction of the bridge attached to the contribution. On 21st March, 1899, the Vestry had before them a letter from the Clerk, London County Council, relative to the proposed widening of Commercial Dock Road, stating that the Council, having regard to all the facts, and particularly in view of the Vestry having expressed their intention of re-opening negotiations with the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, agreed to vary its resolution of 20th December, 1898, by the Avithdrawal of the condition relating to the reconstruction of Lady Dock Bridge, subject to the Vestry doing all within their power to secure the early reconstruction of the said bridge. Resolved—That negotiations be again opened up with the Surrey Commercial Dock Company with reference to the widening of Commercial Dock Road between the bridge to cross the Russia and Greenland Docks communication passage and Lady Dock Bridge. The matter had not progressed at the close of the year. 133 Standing Resolutions. Surveyor's Department. Resolved (6th September, .1898)—That the ratepayers be not now required to place their dust pails outside their houses, as at present obtained, and that the Surveyor take the necessary steps to have the pails fetched from inside the houses by the dustmen, emptied, scraped cut, and re-deposited therein by them for the future. Sanitary Department. On 7th February, 1899, the Sanitary Committee reported, with reference to the reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, that in their opinion the practice of all reports being submitted to the Committee through the heads of departments, obtaining in the Clerk's and Surveyor's departments, should also be adopted with regard to the Sanitary department. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that in future the Medical Officer of Health report upon the work done, etc., by each Inspector, and that each Inspector be required to be in attendance in case his presence is required in the Committee Room. Thames Communication. On 7th June, 1898, the undermentioned gentlemen were appointed a deputation to wait upon the Bridges Committee of the London County Council upon the above subject: — Mr. Vice-chairman Vezey, Mr. J. Brown, Mr. J. C. Mortimer, Mr. R. W. Moss, Mr. R. L. Stuart, and Mr. H. Young. 134 On 19th July, 1898, the deputation reported having prepared the requisite Memorial and been favourably received by the Committee on Wednesday, 13th July, 1898, when it was intimated that some means of communication would be provided, which would probably take the form of a tunnel. The delegates further reported having invited the following authorities to take similar action: — Greenwich District Board, Limehouse ,, St. Olave's „ Poplar „ Whitechapel „ and St. George-in-the-East Vestry. On 25th April, 1899, the London County Council passed the following resolutions: — (a) That a tunnel be constructed to connect the districts of Rotherhithe and Shadwell at at approximate cost of £2,198,250. (b) That application be made in the nest Session of Parliament to carry out the work, and that the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to take the necessary steps for thaipurpose. Tradesmen. The following were the Tradesmen appointed during the year: — For the half-year ending 25th December, 1898. — G. Carr, Smith. E. Walling, Oilman. J. Tolman, Carpenter, A. G. 0. Higgins, Ironmonger. Mrs. Walling, Plumber. G. Lawrence, Wheelwright. J. Daly, Supply of Bedding. 135 For the half-year ending- 24th Tune, 1889: — H. E. Tudor, Smith. R. Thornton, Oilman. F. J. Rooney, Carpenter, W. M. and A. Quiney, Ironmongers W. Durrant and Son., Plumbers. G. Lawrence, Wheelwright. C. Keane, Supply of Bedding. Water Supply. On 20th September, 1898, the Town Hall Management Committee reported with reference to the following report of the Clerk:— I heave been for some time past in communication with the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company upon the question of the basis of the charge for the supply of water to thy Town Hall with the view of obtaining a supply by meter, but up to the present without result. The charge made by the Company is over £40 per annum, which is out of all proportion to the amount consumed. I have found upon enquiry that the company have already granted a supply by meter in respect to the Bermondsey Town Hall, and I think if you will authorise me to continue to press this matter upon the company a like result may be obtained. The Vestry Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the action of the Clerk be approved, and that he be instructed to press the granting of a supply of water by meter to the Town Hall upon the Company. On 18th October, 1898, the Committee reported with reference to the following further report of the Clerk:— Since your last meeting I have been in further correspondence with the Secretary of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, upon the question of the basis of the charge for the water supplied to the Town Hall, and am pleased to say I am in receipt of a letter stating that, in deference to the wishes of the Vestry, the Directors are willing to grant a meter 136 supply on the Parliamentary scale, with a minimum rental of £3 15s.,—100,000 gallons at 9d., the matter to be reconsidered at the end of twelve months. These are the same terms as granted to Bermondsey, but I do not think the Company will re-open the question. The Vestry will, of course, have to pay for a domestic supply in respect to the Caretaker's apartments, which will have to be assessed for the purpose. I have already asked the Overseers to do this. The charge for the latter supply will not exceed £l, and therefore the granting of a meter supply to the other parts of the building means a saving to the Yestry of about £30 per annum. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the terms of the Company be accepted with thanks, and that the action taken by the Clerk in the matter be approved. On 15th November, 1898, the Committee reported with reference to the following further report of the Clerk:— Referring to the Town Hall water agreed to be supplied by meter, I have received, through the Surveyor, two agreements to be signed in respect thereto—one m respect to a meter in Neptune Street, which supplies the front part of the buildings, including stage, and the other in respect to a meter in Moodkee Street, which supplies the remainder, from which it appears that the Company, in consequence of the supply coming unrough two meters, looked upon it as two separate supplies, whereby a minimum charge of £7 10s. was proposed to be made, instead of £3 15s. I therefore wrote to the Secretary of the Company, drawing his attention to the fact that the Company had agreed to give a supply of water by meter for a minimum charge of £3 15s., and that now he proposed to charge double, to which he replied that the Company were quite prepared to adhere to their agreement in the matter and give a supply through one meter, but it appeared that the supply coming through two meters was to suit the convenience of the Vestry, and should be paid for accordingly. To enable the supply to come through one meter the Surveyor informed me would necessitate pulling up the yard. I therefore had an interview with the Company's Secretary, who, after some demur, agreed to look upon the supply as one although coming through two meters, and upon that understanding I have signed an agreement for twelve months on behalf of the Vestry. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the action of the Clerk be approved. 137 Water Troughs. On 21st February, 1899, the General Purposes and Works Committee reported with reference to the letter from the Secretary, Metropolitan Drinking- Fountain and Cattle Trough Association, asking, on behalf of the Committee of the Association, that the Vestry would kindly take over and maintain the trough situate in the parish. Resolved, upon the recommendation of the Committee, that the Vestry, in order to meet them, undertake the cleansing and repair of the trough in question during pleasure. 138 ROTHERHITHE, LONDON.

Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Report upon the work of my department for the year ending 25th March, 1899. Licenses. Sixty-six licenses were granted to erect scaffolds and hoardings in the public footpaths and carriageways for new buildings, alterations, additions or repairs; being an increase of nineteen upon the number granted last year. Road and Footways. In addition to general repairs, special works have been executed as enumerated below: — RED LION CORNER.—For a number of years past the condition of the footway at the "Red Lion" Corner, Lower Road, had been a source of danger to pedestrians owing to the excessive crossfall; the rebuilding of the premises, the erection of new shops at the corner of Bush Road and the giving up of the forecourt of the "Red Lion" and the projecting piece of ground in front of the shops, enabled the work of relaying the whole of the footway to be undertaken and the levels to be improved. The difference in level of the floors (about 15 ins.) of the "Red Lion" P.H. and the first shop made this a matter of great difficulty, 148 owing' to the owners of the P.H. naturally objecting to a second step or kerb in front of their premises. To obviate this it became necessary to also relay a considerable area of the sett roadway at the corner, towards the cost of which the owners contributed a sum of £25. New kerb was laid around the whole of the premises, the existing flagging utilised as far as possible, new flags laid to the extent of 1,241 square feet, which area includes a sample truck of artificial flags called "Non-slip York," made from ground Yorkshire stone and Portland cement, thoroughly well mixed and compressed into slabs of uniform size and thickness by hydraulic pressure. As far as can be judged up to the present time these flags have advantages over other artificial ones made from crushed granite and Portland cement. ADAMS GARDENS.—The unpaved footpath at the side of 45 Adams Gardens and in front of the houses at right angles thereto has been paved in tar paving, with blue brick channels on either side; the cost of this work was apportioned amongst the owners previous to the execution of the work. LOWER ROAD, by TOWN HALL.—The roadway in front of the Town Hall has been paved with Jarrahdale Jarrah hard wood blocks upon a concrete foundation. Previous to the execution of the work the Tramway Company inserted new heavy flanged rails, and, by arrangement, the Vestry paved up to the rails without cost to the Company, the Company agreeing to afterwards maintain and renew, when required, the statutory widths of 3 ft. on either side of the rails. This work consists of an area of 350 yards, 22,188 blocks were used, and the cost, without deducting the value of the old setts, amounted to 15s. 5d. per square yard. In addition to the work enumerated above, numerous other streets have received attention, the following tabulated statement giving the work done in the important ones, in addition to which a large quantity of work has been executed in patching: — 149 street.

The steam roller has been fully employed during the year. The cost of working has been as follows: — £ s. d. Driving, 155 days 41 1 1 Cleaning, Oil, Packing, Coke, Repairs,etc. 47 12 10 88 13 11 10 per cent, depreciation 39 0 0 £127 13 11 The total working days were 155, a decrease of 16 upon last year. The cost per day equals 16s. 6d., against 15s, l½d. last year, and 14s. 11d. for 1896-7, but this is accounted for by reason of the extensive repairs which have been carried out to maintain the roller in a high state of efficiency, and which included the entire re-tubing of the boiler. The saving upon the year's work by having our own roller amounts to £135 16s. 1d., or a total since its delivery in May, 1895, of £586 5s. 4d., this amount being £178 5s. 4d. in excess of the purchase price of the roller which has been at work a total of 644 days. Sewers. No additional sewers have been constructed during the year, but the following lengths of existing sewers have been relaid, laid on and surrounded with 6 in. of cement concrete, the pipes jointed in cement, laid in straight lines between the points of inspection and provided with manholes and flushing hafts: — Arica Place 9 in. pipe 120 feet Aspinden Road 15 in. ,, 465 ,, Chilton Street (north side) between Nos. 1 to 49 9 in. ,, 485 ,, Old Road 12 in. ,, 100 ,, Manor Lane 12 in. „ B25 ,, 9 in. „ 85 „ 157 Penstocks so as to enable the sewers to be thoroughly and efficiently flushed have been fixed as follows : — Aspinden Road 1 Chilton Street 2 Manor Lane 1 The quantity of silt removed from the sewers owing to the constant flushing shews a marked decrease, being only 49 cubic yards against 213½ cubic yards last year. The van or cart has been engaged flushing 161¼ days, against 137 last year, the whole of the water used being taken from the Company's mains, amounting to 600 loads for the cart and 779 loads for the van, or 530,550 galls. Gullies• The gullies now number 844, being an increase of two during the year, fixed in Hadland Street; 278¼ cubic yards of silt has been removed from them, a horse and van being engaged flushing them on 122½ days, using 1,978 van loads, or 890,100 galls. of water from the Company's mains. Pour new connections have been made to the sewers for existing gullies by reason of their defective condition or alteration of position: — Bush Road 1 Lower Road 1 Hickling Street 2 The new gullies fixed in Hadland Street consist of cast iron ones, with removable dirt boxes, which are emptied by the sweepers once every week. The following defective pits of gullies have been replaced: — Lower Road (earthenware). 1 Bush Road do. 1 Abbeyfield Road do. 1 158 Church. Passage (east iron gully). 1 Hobman Street do. 1 Rotherhithe Street do. 1 And five cast iron gullies have been fixed at the wharf in connection with the paving works and destructor buildings. New cast iron gulley grids and frames have been fixed as under: — Lower Road 2 Rotherhithe Street 3 Bush Road 1 Clarence Street 1 St. Mary Church Street 1 Union Road 1 Ainsty Street 1 Fifteen of the existing gullies have had new syphons fixed to them: — Elephant Lane 1 Gataker Street 1 Aspinden Road 1 Hickling Street 1 Silwood Street 1 Littlington Street 1 Dilston Grove 3 Union Road 1 Slippers Place 2 Manor Place 1 Hawkstone Road 2 Manholes. Nine new manholes have been constructed upon the sewers during the past year :•— Prospect Street 1 Old Road 1 Aspinden Road 1 Manor Lane 1 Chilton Street 3 Wharf 2 Nineteen existing manholes have had new covers and frames fixed: — Hatteraick Street 1 Trinity Road 1 Temeraire Street 1 Wharf 1 St. Mary Church Street 2 Rotherhithe Street 2 Arica Place 1 Pedworth Road 1 Aspinden Road 1 Manor Lane 4 160 Chilton Street 3 Hadland Street 1 Five new frames and covers have been fixed upon the lamphole and flushing shafts : — Arica Place 1 Hadland Street 1 Manor Lane 1 Rotherhithe Street 1 Paradise Street 1 Drainage Works.

The cost charged to the owners for the connections and for the necessary interceptor and inspection chamber under the footway where no forecourt existed amounted to £206 9s. 2d. This total includes the insertion of five inspection chambers upon existing connections. 160 Street Watering. The number of standposts remain the same as last year, but the position of the one at the corner of Bush Road has been altered slightly to suit the new kerb line. The total cost of street watering amounted to £471 7s. 7d., and is divided as follows: — £ s. d. £ s. d. Standposts.

Previous to the commencement of the season the vans were overhauled and repaired at a cost of £27 7s. 6d., and sundry repairs were executed during the season amounting to £11 4s. Urinals. No additional urinal has been erected during the year, but the one at the junction of Southwark Park Road and Union Road, hitherto in conjunction with the one at the junction of Southwark Park Road and Galleywall Road, jointly maintained by the Vestries of Bermondsey and Rothernithe, has been maintained by us, making the number 12, with accommodation for 48 persons at one time. 161 The total cost of maintenance of the 12 for the year being as follows: — £ s. d. £ s. d.

Average cost per unit of accommodation per annum, £3 7s. 10d. Total water used as registered by the meters, 1,357,000 gallons. It will thus be seen when compared with last year's report that a saving of £30 13s. 6d. has been effected, although one additional urinal has been maintained, increased to £75 162 5s. 4d. if the amount paid to Bermondsey last year is included, of which sum £23 10s. is accounted for in the item "Cleaning and repairing urinals," which is only done every alternate year. The saving per annum in terminating the joint maintenance of the two before-mentioned urinals amounts to £24 4s. 10d., as against £15 estimated by me. Lighting. At the commencement of the year the Public Lamps in the Parish numbered as follows: — Ordinary Street Lamps 502 Sugg's Patent 6 10 ft. and 7 ft. per hour 3 Large Lanters 11 522 Seven new lamps have been erected and two discontinued, as under: — NEW LAMPS.

During the past year the days of collection for the respective districts have been altered so as to admit of the men finishing work as near as possible to 1 p.m. on Saturdays. The district hitherto collected on Wednesday and Saturday which was farthest from the wharf has been altered to Monday and Thursday. The Monday and Thursday collection, which was Albion Street and nearest the wharf, is now Wednesday and Saturday. The change has worked admirably, without inconvenience to the public, and given satisfaction to the men. The quantity collected during the year has amounted to 3,410 loads, with a total weight of 5,858 tons 4 cwts., an increase of 168 loads and 107 tons 3 cwts. when compared with last year's collection. The quarterly collection has been as follows: — Loads. Tons. Cwt.

Thirty-three pails have been repaired during the year at a cost of £1 4s. 9d., and 500 new ones supplied in May by Mr. Phillip Hound, of Lye, near Stourbridge, at a cost of £54 3s. 4d. Bull Head Wharf and Dock. Considerable progress has been made during the year in adapting the premises at Bull Head Dock and Victoria Oil Mills for the use of the Vestry as a wharf and depot. The chimney shaft was completed upon the 1st July, 1898; the work cost £2556 15s. 7d., this being an increase of £128 12s. 7d., entirely due to the extra depth of the foundations mentioned in last year's report. The contract for the Destructor Buildings, after advertisements had been issued, was let to Messrs. Henry Knight and Co., of Tottenham, who commenced operations on the 1st July, 1898, the amount of the contract being £3,933 10s. 6d., and the works are now practically completed. They consist of Destructor House and Tipping Shed, 63 ft. 10 in. long by 29 ft. 10½ in. wide, built in stock brickwork. The principals of the roof consist entirely of wrought iron, covered with tongued and grooved boarding and slating. At the river end is placed the Tipping Shed, 20 ft. 4 in. wide, approached by an inclined roadway with a gradient of 1ft. in 20ft., and varying in width from 12 ft. 6 in. to 10 ft. This roadway is constructed of steel joists fixed about 7 ft. apart, the intervening spaces being covered with steel arched plates rivetted to the joists, filled in with concrete and paved with granite setts. Beneath the Tipping Shed is placed the Engine House and Mortar Mill, entirely separated by a division wall. The former is approached from a door in the passageway 167 leading to the wharf and the cells; the latter from the inclined roadway down to the clinkering floor, which is 9 ft. 6 in. below the level of the tipping floor. The Destructor Building upon the dock face is carried for a height of 12 ft. 3 in. by steel joists, supported upon blue brick piers built in cement, 2 ft. 3 in. wide by 1 ft. 6 in. in depth, the clear span between each being 12 ft. Carried out from the before-mentioned joists and supported by corbels from the piers is a lean-to roof to screen the men from the weather when clinkering the furnaces upon that face. At the south end of the building- is placed the Disinfector House, divided into two portions by a wall extending from the floor to the roof. The side of the room for "infected" goods is 18 ft. by 15 ft., that for the "disinfected" goods 12 ft. by 15 ft. Within this building has been placed one of Washington Lyon's most improved full size steam disinfectors, erected by Messrs. Manlove, Alliot and Co., Ltd., of Nottingham, at a cost of £317 10s. This building also has a wrought iron roof covered with the same materials as the Destructor Building. Every possible consideration has been given to the question of ventilation, windows being fixed upon every side, as large as possible, with semi-circular heads, which have been made to open. In addition to this, skylights to open have also been placed in the roofs. Beneath the inclined roadway space has been left for a very large store. The contract for the cells, boilers and machinery has been let to the Beaman and Deas Syndicate, but, except as regards the boilers, which have been made by Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox, of Renfrew, Glasgow, and tested by me at their works, very little progress at present has been made with this contract, it being impossible to do much until the contractors for the buildings were out of the way. The Furnaces will comprise one Patent Double Cell Destructor, consisting of two cells, two drying hearths and one combustion chamber, arranged so that each cell acts literally as a cremator to the other. They will be capable of destroying 30 tons of house refuse per day of 24 hours by burning under forced draught to a hard clinker. 168 They will be built upon a foundation of cement concrete, faced with red pressed Tunbridge Wells bricks; the whole of the internal parts exposed to a direct or radiated action of flame being lined with special fire bricks laid on and jointed in pure fire clay. The engine will be of the horizontal type, capable of indicating 20 h.p., fixed upon a strong cast iron bed plate. The cylinder, cast with valve chest, in one piece. The piston will have spring rings and steel piston rod. The whole of the bearings will be of gun metal. The fan will be of the high pressure type, fitted with steel shaft and disc of wrought iron. There will be two boilers of the water tube type, each with 735 square feet of heatingsurface. The working pressure will be 120 lbs. to the square inch. The tubes will be lapwelded of the best wrought iron, having hand-holes for cleaning opposite each end, and the steam and water drums will be of best mild steel plate. They will be supported on wrought iron columns by expansion bars to overhead wrought iron girders. The fronts will be ornamental above the combustion chamber of the furnace, with a large door giving access to the tubes for cleaning. The tube sections and mud drums have been tested by me at the makers' works by hydraulic pressure of 300 lbs. to the square inch, and the steam and water drums by the same pressure to 200 lbs. per square inch. The completed boilers, when fixed, will be further tested to the same pressure. Two feed tanks and one direct acting feed pump will be fixed to supply the boilers with water. They will also be fitted with hand firing doors at the side for use if at any time they are to be worked when refuse is not available. The boiler fittings will be supplied by Messrs. J. Hopkinson and Co., of huddersfield. The flue, which is 5 ft. high and 3 ft. wide, between the south end of the boilers and the shaft was a portion of the contract for the buildings, and has been built entirely 109 neath the surface, and passes under the Instructor House. The connection to this will consist of a cross main flue, to he built at the back of the furnaces and connected with both boilers. There will also be a bye-pass flue built between the two boilers, which latter will connect at the end by a down-take, with a transverse flue joining to the beforementioned underground flue just outside the main building. The whole of these flues have or will be lined entirely upon the inner face with fire bricks. Each boiler and the bye-pass will be provided with a damper, allowing either boiler to be worked by itself or the gases to pass direct to the chimney. The contract for the work undertaken by the Beaman and Deas Syndicate amounts to £2,200, and the whole has to be maintained for a period of six months after completion. Town Hall. During the past year extensive alterations and additions have been effected at the Town Hall. Following the report of the Medical Officer and myself, and upon the recommendation of a Special Committee, the Vestry agreed to remedy the defective ventilation of the Council Chamber in accordance with the report. All the ceiling openings have been connected up to the central main shaft, and an electrically direct driven exhaust fan has been fixed therein of a size capable of changing the whole of the air in the room every fifteen minutes. The inlet openings have been considerably increased, and an arrangement of copper cones fixed all round the room, so that the air is completely diffused and no inconvenience felt. The contract for this work was executed by Messrs. J. H. Pickup and Co., Bury, the price being £79 17s. 6d. The electric light has been installed in the whole of the building, but owing to the defective condition and undersizing of the wires when the building was erected some, difficulty was experienced with the Insurance Co. and with the London County Council, 170 the wiring of the Public Hall not being in accordance with their regulations, necessitating practically rewiring and a separation or circuits, switch and fuse boards and transformers. The tender was let to Messrs. Pickup at £128. A new open balustraded oak gallery front has been fixed to the public gallery of the Council Chamber in lieu of the original panelled front, and the seating has been rearranged. This work was executed by Mr. William Harbrow, South Bermondsey Works, the contract amount being £59 10s. It having been found that no accommodation had been provided for the serving of refreshments in connection with the letting of the Public Hall, in accordance with instructions plans were prepared for covering over a portion of the yard. These plans, after slight amendments and additions, received the approval of the London County Council. The building was constructed by Mr. William Nash, of New Cross, and the roof work, which is practically all of wrought iron, with "Mellowes's" patent bars glazed with ¼.n. rough plate, was constructed by Messrs. Mellowes and Co., the cost of the whole of the work amounting to just over £250. The London County Council having raised objections to the use of combination, fittings When the installation of the electric light was completed in the Public Hall, as a necessary precaution in case of failure of the light a sun burner of 600 c.p. has been fixed in the centre of the ceiling, with a galvanized iron exhaust shaft carried up through the roof.

M. Inst. C.E. Engineer and Surveyor. Gentlemen, Since writing the above, having been appointed Chief Surveyor to the Vestry of Hackney, and my resignation having been accepted of the appointment I have had the honour of holding from you for the past five and a half years, I cannot sever my official connection without desiring to thank every member of the Vestry for the kindness, consideration and support I have always received during the whole period, and to assure you that my services will always be available to my successor should he desire any assistance which it is in my power to give. Yours obediently, NORMAN SCORGIE. Town Hall, 24th June, 1899. THE! ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH From January 1st to December 31st, 1898. To the Chairman and Members of the Rotherhithe Vestry:— Gentlemen, I have the pleasure herewith of offering to your notice my Annual Report, compiled from the various Reports that have been submitted to you at the regular half-monthly meetings during the year. N.B. —All the calculations of Birth and Death Rates are based on the Census return, giving the corrected population as 40,400 for the year. Owing to the demolition of houses in Osprey Street and Yeoman Street on account of the Dock Extension; and Silwood Street, Debnam's Row, New Road, and Raymouth Road, owing to S.E.R. Co. requiring these properties, and the consequent exodus of population from the parish, I have allowed the number of inhabitants to remain the same as last year. Number of Births registered:— Males.
