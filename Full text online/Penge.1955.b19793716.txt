To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1955, which has been compiled in accordance with Circulars 3/56 and 17/55 of the Ministry of Health. The Vital Statistics show little change from the previous year and compare favourably with those for England and Wales. The Birth Rate for the District is above the average for the country and is slightly higher than last year, while the adjusted death rate remains the same. It is pleasing to note that the number of stillbirths was nearly half that of the previous year. Again, the number of deaths from cancer shows a small increase, but there was only one death from tuberculosis. Infectious diseases have been few save for an epidemic of measles which was of a mild type and produced fewer cases than in some previous years. It is gratifying to record that there has been only one case of Sonne Dysentery notified during the year. To what extent the poster and leaflet campaign inaugurated last year and carried on for the first six months of this year is responsible is pure conjecture. One hopes, however, that by constant reiteration of the fact that regular washing of the hands after the use of the toilet and before handling any food this disease may be prevented. In this way loss of schooling for the children and possibly of work by the wage earner and a large amount of extra work for this already busy department can be avoided. There has for the eighth successive year been no case of diphtheria in the district, but in spite of this any relaxation in the immunisation procedure is fraught with danger. There are still too many children who have received no protective inoculations and among these it is quite possible for an outbreak to occur with possibly some fatal cases. Whilst immunisation will not entirely prevent any child catching the disease, the chances of any serious development are remote. The welfare of the old people in the district has been well looked after by various voluntary bodies who receive very little publicity for the large amount of hard work which is undertaken by them in the provision of meals at home, clubs and a residential home. They deserve the thanks and support of the district whose older members would have a very much more difficult life without their help and encouragement. There were a few cases of food poisoning all unconnected with one another. Further progress was made during the year with housing projects, but there still remain a number of families who for various reasons need re-housing. Each year the number of available sites diminish and the difficulty of rehousing becomes more acute. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-Year 1955 (estimated by Registrar General) 25,470 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1955 £212,155 Sum represented by Id. rate £850 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33.0, this being the highest in the County of Kent. The remains of the Crystal Palace and the greater part of the grounds occupying 127 acres, are within the district and provide a much needed "lung " for the area. The district is mainly residential, although there is an amount of light industrial work in the district, the chief industries being engineering, button making, printing and laundry work. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were approximately 84 men and 27 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Crude Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 20.41 Adjusted Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home Population 18.37 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 0.39 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still births) 17.0 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 10.24 Adjusted Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 9.64 Death Rates of Infants under One Year of Age All infants per 1,000 live births 26.92 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 26.31 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 1.92 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 520, compared with 485 in 1954. This gives a crude live birth rate of 20.41 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 19.05 for 1954. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local birth rates is 0.90. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 18.37 compared with 17.14 in 1954. The birth rate for England and Wales was 15.0. 5 Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 9, equal to a rate of 17.00 per 1,000 total births, compared with 31.93 for 1954. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 261, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 10.24 per 1,000 Home population, compared with 10.37 in 1954. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.93. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 9.64, the same rate as for 1954. The Death Rate for England and Wales was 11.7. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 14. A large proportion of the deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths 179 or 68.2% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 71.9% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 45.6% of the total deaths, compared with 42.4% in 1954. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 49, giving a death rate per 1,000 Home population of 1.90 compared with 1.61 in 1954. The rate for England and Wales was 2.05. Tuberculosis The death rate per 1,000 Home population was 0.039 against 0.23 in 1954. The rate for England and Wales was 0.13. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year, compared with a rate of 1.99 per 1,000 (live and still) births for 1954. The rate for England and Wales was 0.54 compared with 0.69 in 1954. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 14, corresponding to a rate of 26.92 per 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 26.80 for 1954. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 24.9. Eleven of the fourteen infants died under the age of four weeks, six of whom died from congenital malformations Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1955:— Rate per 1,000Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 18.37 17.0 9.64 26.92 England and Wales 15.0 23.1 11.7 24.9 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the district being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The County Pathologist reports that the samples of water submitted to him quarterly were good. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Two storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Additional manholes were constructed in the Council's sewers during the year. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse was collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. HOUSING The erection of 83 flats by the local authority was completed during the year. Private builders erected 19 dwelling houses and 41 flats, and provided three flats by converting existing houses. 1.

PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria For the 8th year in succession no cases of diphtheria occurred in the district. 8 Diphtheria Immunisation The following is a return of the number of children resident in the district who were immunised against diphtheria during the year:— Children born 1951-1955 Children born 1941-1950 Totals Primary inoculations 378 43 421 Reinforcing „ 37 249 286 Penge children under the age of 15 years on the 31st December, 1955, who had completed a course of immunisation at any time before that date were as follows:— Aged 0-4 years inclusive 1,125 „ 5-14 „ „ 3,580 Smallpox No case was notified and one Penge contact of a case occurring elsewhere was reported. The following shows the number of Penge residents who were vaccinated against smallpox during the year:— Age at 31/12/55 Under 1 1 to 4 5 to 14 15 or over Total Vaccinated 240 130 16 7 393 Re-vaccinated — 1 5 7 13 Scarlet Fever There were 17 cases of scarlet fever notified (as against 79 in 1954) and 8 cases were removed to hospital.

Poliomyelitis Four cases occurred during the year, two being non-paralytic and two paralytic. Sonne Dysentery There was only one case of Sonne Dysentery during 1955, this being contracted abroad. 9 Measles A total of 584 cases was notified during the year compared with 11 in the previous year. There were no deaths. Whooping Cough Cases were notified throughout the year and totalled 35, compared with 45 cases in 1954. There were no deaths. It is to be hoped that with the increased use of vaccine against this disease it will continue to decline. Disinfection Verminous rooms disinfested 123 Rooms fumigated 13 Mattresses disinfected 19 Blankets disinfected 29 Pillows disinfected 17 Miscellaneous articles disinfected 22 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (Other than Tuberculosis) during the year 1955 Diseases Total cases notified Cases admitted to Hospitals Total Deaths Scarlet Fever 17 8 — Pneumonia 12 1 11 (all forms) Poliomyelitis (Non-paralytic) 2 2 — „ (Paralytic) 2 2 — Erysipelas 2 — — Measles 584 3 — Whooping Cough 35 — — Dysentery 1 — — Food poisoning 5 — — Paratyphoid 2 2 — 10 Tuberculosis No action was necessary under the Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations 1925, or under section 172, Public Health Act 1936.

During the year two bodies were dealt with by the Council under these provisions. FOOD Under section 16, Food and Drug Act 1955, 83 premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream and 39 premises for the manufacture or preparation of preserved food. Four of the dairies are registered under the Milk & Dairies Regulations, 1949. Regular inspections of food shops, restaurants and stores have been made and advice given in hygienic food preparation and handling, particular stress being paid to the importance of personal hygiene. The hygienic storage and handling of food continued to show improvement. As will be seen in the Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report, a considerable amount of food has been surrended by the food traders and their applications for examinations to be made of foodstuffs of which they are doubtful as to the fitness, helps to safeguard the purity of the food supply. No animals were slaughtered in the district. Food Poisoning. Five isolated cases, 4 due to salmonella organisms and one unknown, were reported, but it was not possible to obtain specimens of food eaten to identify the cause. Special posters illustrating the causes of and advice on how to prevent food poisoning were exhibited in a prominent position in the Public Library, and the School and Maternity & Child Welfare Clinics. The posters were also displayed on notice boards and other sites in the district and at school canteens. The great importance of thoroughly washing their hands after using the watercloset cannot be too strongly emphasised to all persons before handling food, whether it be in the factory, shop, canteen or the home. 12 MORTUARY During the year 17 bodies were brought to the Mortuary where post mortem examinations were conducted by a Home Office Pathologist. A refrigerating chamber is installed in the mortuary. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation at all times. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B. E. HAWKINS, Medical Officer of Health.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, In the absence of the Chief Sanitary Inspector on account of illness, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1955. During the year 761 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints were investigated and appropriate action taken when found necessary. Applications for certificates of disrepair were received and granted in respect of 14 premises, and 28 applications for revocation certificates were received and granted. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 479 written informal notices and 86 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. 438 intimation notices and 81 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority, in default of the owners, had carried out works required by four statutory notices under section 94, Public Health Act 1936, and two notices served under section 75. The Council also did the work required by 9 notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains) at 8 premises. The amount of repair work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. In twenty-six premises, however, repairs were not executed until legal proceedings against the owners or agents were either threatened or taken. The present cost of carrying out repairs, particularly in older properties, subject to controlled rents, is frequently the reason of the department being required to take action by the tenants, whereas previously in many cases the repairs would be undertaken by the landlord without the occupier needing to seek the assistance of the department. 16 It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against the owners or agents of 12 properties in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects, with the following results:— case no. result 1 Nuisance Order made to do work within three months. 2 Nuisance Order made to do work within six weeks. 3 (a) Nuisance Order made to do work within 14 days. (b) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £2. 0. 0. 4 and 5 Summons adjourned as a contractor was instructed to carry out the work between the taking out of the summons and the date fixed for the hearing. 6 Summons issued and hearing adjourned sine die, the owners undertaking to carry out the work. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 .. Summons adjourned as a contractor was instructed to carry out the work between the taking out of the summons and the date fixed for the hearing. The work was subsequently carried out. 12 Nuisance Order made to do work within 28 days. Orders for the payment of Court costs by the defendants were made in each case where a nuisance order was made. Demolition Orders were made under Section 11, Housing Act, 1936, in respect of two houses. A Closing Order was made under Section 10, Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953, in lieu of a Demolition Order, in respect of one semi-detached house. Closing Orders were made under Section 12, Housing Act, 1936, respecting seven basement flats and one basement room which did not comply with the regulations as to underground rooms and could not be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 35 premises were relaid or partially relaid and 61 cleared of obstruction. Disinfestation of 123 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Five licences to deal in game were issued during the year. Mr. A. I. Bell took up appointment as Sanitary Inspector on the 11th February, 1955. 17 SUMMARY OF INSPECTIONS AND VISITS The following summary shows the number of visits and inspections made:— Inspections through complaints received 657 Housing Act 263 Overcrowding and measurement of rooms 10 Infectious diseases 74 Houses-let-in-Lodgings and Common lodging houses 111 Bakehouses 85 Dairies and milk distributors 91 Meat shops 170 Fish frying shops 40 Ice cream shops 76 Cafes and restaurants 158 Food factories 144 Other food shops, stores and stalls 605 Public conveniences 81 Stables 20 Rats and mice 350 Factories 234 Outworkers 51 Schools 8 Smoke observation 23 Drain tests 150 Keeping of animals 21 Food and water sampling 137 Movable dwellings 20 Rag Flock and Pet Animals Acts 16 Transferable deaths 97 Revisits and inspections of works in hand 3,576 Miscellaneous visits 251 Shops Act inspections and patrols 372 Heating Appliances Act 5 SUMMARY OF WORK EXECUTED DURING THE YEAR Water Supply:— Water supply reinstated to houses 6 Water service pipes repaired 19 Cisterns cleansed, covered or covers repaired 2 Water Closets:— New pans and traps fixed 15 Flushing apparatus renewed or repaired 28 Foul pans and traps cleansed 9 Connection of flushing pipes to pans made good 3 Seats and doors provided or repaired 16 Ventilation provided or improved 5 Walls repaired 4 Flooring or paving repaired 6 18 Drainage:— Drains tested with smoke, water or colour 150 Drains cleared 61 Houses with drains relaid or partially relaid 35 Inspection chambers constructed or improved 12 Soil and ventilation pipes fixed or repaired 5 Sinks, lavatory basins and baths provided 2 Sink fillets repaired 7 Waste pipes renewed or provided 10 Waste pipes repaired or trapped 6 Waste pipes cleared 6 Fresh-air-inlets provided or repaired 4 Dampness—Houses with:— Walls repointed or rendered 11 Dampness in ground floor rooms remedied 54 Roofs repaired 138 Gutters repaired or renewed 37 Rainwater pipes repaired or renewed 15 Ventilation under floors provided or improved 3 Water service pipes repaired 19 Window sills repaired 11 Cleanliness:— Dirty rooms etc. cleansed 62 Verminous rooms disinfested 123 Miscellaneous:— Houses with floors, joists, etc., repaired 70 Houses with skirtings repaired 8 Houses with plaster repaired 57 Houses with new sashlines provided to windows 31 Houses with window frames etc. repaired 26 Houses with yard or forecourt paved or repaired 20 Houses with scullery paving repaired 2 Houses with chimneys repaired 25 Houses with airbricks renewed 3 Houses with stairs repaired 14 Houses with front and back steps repaired 6 Houses with fireplace jambs and mantels repaired 11 Houses with brickwork repaired 15 Kitchen stoves repaired or renewed 12 Other stoves repaired or renewed 32 Hearths renewed or repaired 4 Doors and frames repaired or renewed 12 Ventilation and lighting of rooms improved 3 New dustbins provided 61 Premises with miscellaneous defects repaired 23 Accumulations removed 13 Animal nuisances abated 1 Ventilated food stores provided 11 19 HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954 This Act, which came into force on the 30th August, 1954, enables a landlord whose property is in good condition to claim a repairs increase on the rent, provided he serves the necessary notices declaring that he has satisfied the expenditure test etc. If the tenant is dissatisfied with the condition of his house he can apply to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair. If this is granted the increase in the rent can be withheld until such time as the landlord remedies the items of disrepair enumerated in the certificate and obtains from the local authority a certificate of revocation. Little use was made of this Act. Applications for certificates of disrepair received were 14, which were granted. Applications for revocation certificates received and granted were 28, compared with 36 applications for disrepair certificates and one for a revocation certificate dealt with during the last four months of 1954. The high cost of repairs and the low permitted increase of rent is doubtless the reason for little use of the provisions of the Act being made by landlords. HOUSING—CLEARANCE OF UNFIT HOUSES A preliminary survey was made during the year of the district as required by the Act. As a result of this survey a clearance scheme involving forty houses was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out, 1,369 visits being made in this connection. On a few occasions the attention of the persons concerned was called to contraventions of the byelaws made under Section 15, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, but in one of these cases was it considered necessary to take statutory action. Legal proceedings were taken against a butcher in respect of two offences under Section 9, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for having in his possession for sale food which was unfit for human consumption. Fines of £5 were imposed in respect of each offence. Legal proceedings were also taken against a baker under Section 3, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, in respect of a loaf of bread containing foreign matter. The Magistrates imposed a fine of £5 and ordered the payment of £3. 3. 0. costs.

There are four dairies on the register and 27 persons are registered as distributors.

Eight samples of sterilised milk were examined and satisfied the Turbidity Test. Ice-Cream There are no manufacturers in the district, but 81 premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream, the shopkeepers obtaining their supplies from wellknown manufacturers. In the great majority of cases the ice-cream is delivered to the premises and sold in cartons or wrapped. Twenty-four samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the methylene blue test with the following results:— Grade 1—19; Grade 2—3; Grade 3—2 In no case was ice cream found to be stored at a temperature exceeding 28° Farenheit.

These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 36 Penge residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes, but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. SMOKE ABATEMENT During the year complaints were received of a smoke nuisance from a factory in the district. Observations made confirmed the complaint, and as a result the co-operation of the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service was enlisted. It was found that the nuisance arose from the mal-adjustment of the automatic stoking apparatus whereby excessive quantities of fuel were fed into the furnaces. The stoking apparatus was adjusted so that without any loss of boiler efficiency the nuisance was abated. Further, as a result of this action the firm's fuel consumption was considerably reduced. At one factory laundry in the district plans have been made to convert the boilers from coal to oil fuel during the year 1956. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 313 regarding rats and mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. The constant action which has been taken to destroy rodents during recent years has caused a diminution in the severity of the infestations found in the district and in no case was a major infestation discovered. Rats are such prolific breeders, however, that it is in the public's interest to report to the public health department as soon as they suspect the presence of rodents in or about their premises. A free service is provided for the destruction of rodents in private dwellings. In several cases it was found that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of infestations. When considered necessary the drainage systems of premises were tested with smoke and colour and all defects made good. As in previous years, the foul-water sewers were treated on two occasions, prebait and poisoned bait being laid in the manholes and side entrances. In June 328 manholes were baited and pre-bait takes recorded in 80. The figures for the December treatment were 329 manholes baited and prebait takes recorded in 120. 23 One full time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of the work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and reinspections made 3,347 Premises treated for rats 337 Premises where rat poison bait taken 237 Premises re-treated for rats 308 Estimated number of rats poisoned 688 Premises treated for mice 141 Premises re-treated for mice 81 It was necessary to treat some premises on three or more occasions and the total treatments for the destruction of rodents numbered 867. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 The object of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Three premises are registered in connection therewith. Samples of materials used at each of the registered premises were obtained and the prescribed Analyst under the Act reported the tests showed the samples to be satisfactory and complied with the requirements of the regulations. MOVABLE DWELLINGS The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds established in 1951 continues to be occupied. Suites of waterclosets and lavatory basins are provided in a brick building on the site, and there are suitable arrangements for the collection and disposal of refuse. Periodic inspections were made of the camp and it was found on all visits to be satisfactory. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act came into force on the 1st April, 1952, and regulates the sale of pet animals. Licences were granted to three applicants and subject to conditions laid down by the Council, these conditions being based on those recommended by the R.S.P.C.A. No contraventions were observed. SHOPS ACT, 1950 YOUNG PERSONS (EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1938 Mr. E. G. Thomas, Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector and Shops Act Inspector, reports as follows:— Number of visits made 305 Number of evening patrols carried out 59 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 23 Number of premises where young persons employed 33 Number of premises where official forms relating to staff not posted up 17 24 Number of "mixed shops" where poster relating to Sunday trading not exhibited 4 Number of shops where heating facilities were provided following service of intimation notice 1 Letters of warning were sent with reference to contravention of the Acts relative to the non-exhibition of forms relating to "mixed shops" when open for Sunday trading, and for failing to post up official forms regarding employment of shop assistants and young persons. A letter of warning was sent to one trader who was detected selling articles on Sunday in contravention of the Act. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 and HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953 These regulations made it an offence to sell or expose for sale certain heating appliances, unless fitted with an effective fireguard as prescribed in the regulations. As a result of this enactment and statutory instrument the tests prescribed on heating appliances exposed for sale in the district were made. Number of premises where tests carried out 5 Number of premises where appliances failed to pass the prescribed tests 2 Letters were sent to the proprietors of these shops, who immediately withdrew the appliances from sale. I should like to express my thanks and those of the Chief Sanitary Inspector, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and assistance and to the Staff for their great help and efficient service during the year.
