REPORT OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD FOR THE YEAR 1876-77, AND REPORTS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER, ANALYST, AND SURVEYOR; Also Accounts in Abstract of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board during the same period. Printed in accordance with section 198 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, (18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120,) and ordered to be circulated among the Inhabitants of the District. In accordance with notice given in November last, the Metro- Thames Ri??? (Preventi of Floods Bill. politan Board of "Works introduced into Parliament a Bill for preventing inundations, shortly intituled "The Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill." It was described as one to amend the Metropolis Local Management Act, so far as related to the protection of the Metropolis from floods and inundations caused by the overflow of the River Thames; and proposed to empower the Metropolitan Board of Works, by any general or special order issued by them, to require the Vestry of any parish, or the Board of "Works for any district within the limits of the Metropolis, to execute any works which the Metropolitan Board might deem necessary or expedient for effectually protecting such parish or district from floods or inundations caused by overflow of the river. a 2 4 and thereupon such Vestry or District Board was to proceed to execute such works, under the authority and with the powers con ferred upon them by the above-mentioned Act, as amended by the intended Act; and the cost of the necessary works was to be made a charge—general or special, as the Metropolitan Board might determine—upon the ratepayers and owners of riverside property in the neighbourhoods affected by inundations. Shortly after the introduction of the Bill into Parliament, this Board proceeded to consider its provisions; and, at the solicitation of the Vestry of Lambeth, appointed delegates—viz., Messrs Thorn, Cozens, and Goodwin—to attend at the Lambeth Vestry Hall, and confer with that Vestry and other riparian parishes and districts whose interests were affected by the proposed measure After several conferences had been held, it was resolved by the assembled delegates to oppose the Bill, on the ground that the necessary works for preventing inundations would constitute a metropolitan improvement, and as such should be paid for out of the funds of the Metropolis at large. This Board concurred in the above-mentioned resolution, considering that it would be unjust to the ratepayers and inhabitants of waterside districts to charge them with the entire cost of the works as proposed by the Bill; they being the principal sufferers by the inundations, and having contributed a rateable proportion of the cost of the northern and other embankments of the Thames, besides other extensive works in various parts of London: but as the interests of the several parishes and districts represented at the conference were not absolutely identical upon all points, this Board resolved to take separate action in opposing the Bill. A petition was accordingly prepared on behalf of this Board and presented to Parliament, praying that such Bill might not pass into a law as it then stood, and that the petitioners might be heard by themselves, their counsel, agents, and witnesses, against the preamble and clauses thereof; and, if need were, in support of amendments and provisions for the protection of the district under the care of this Board. The Bill was read for the second time on the 7th March last, and referred to a Selcct Committee of the House of Commons, before 5 which this Board and various other District Boards and Vestries, wharfingers, owners of docks and other properties affected by the Bill were represented by counsel; G. P. Bidder, Esq., Q.C., being the counsel retained on behalf of this Board. The Committee sat on the 8th May, and from time to time held as many as ten sittings, bestowing great care and attention to the evidence laid before them, and to the arguments of counsel on either side. Ultimately, on Friday, the 15th June instant, their Chairman, M. E. Grant Duff, Esq., M.P., announced that the Committee had come to the following resolution, viz.:—"That the most equitable mode of charging and meeting expenses to be incurred for the prevention of floods within the metropolitan district, would be that the works should be carried into effect by the Metropolitan Board of "Works, and the expenses paid out of a rate levied over the whole metropolitan area." The Committee thereupon adjourned until the following Wednesday, the 20th June, to enable the Metropolitan Board, as the promoter of the Bill, to consider the course it would adopt; and that Board, at a Special Meeting held for the purpose, has resolved, by a majority of six, not to take any further proceedings with the Bill during the present Session. The Bill, therefore, falls to the ground for the present Session; a result to be regretted in view of the danger of a recurrence of flood tides, and the unprotected state of the district, but satisfactory in having elicited the above expression of opinion from a Parliamentary Committee, whose views will doubtless shape the course of future legislation upon the subject. The Metropolitan Board of "Works has further promoted a Bill Toll Bridge intituled "The Toll Bridges (River Thames) Bill," having for its object the freeing from toll of the remaining toll bridges over the River Thames; and this Board has again petitioned Parliament in support of the measure, and has reason to believe that it will be passed during the present Session. On receipt of a circular-letter from the Managers of the Metro- Hospitals f??? Infection Disorders. politan Asylum District, dated the 26th February last, forwarding Extract from a Report of a Committee of the Managers relative to hospital accommodation for small-pox patients, stating that a large 6 proportion of the patients received into the Hospitals of the Managers belonged to a class above that of paupers, and that adequate accommodation for the isolation and treatment of epidemic infectious diseases in the Metropolis did not exist, only five out of thirty of the various Vestries and District Boards, who are the authorities at present charged with the duty, having been able to make the necessary provision, and suggesting that such provision could be best made by one central authority for the whole of London; this Board, acting under the advice of its Sanitary Committee and Medical Officer, resolved, that having regard to the disadvantages and difficulties in the way of providing adequate local accommodation of the kind referred to, separately for each Parish or District, the Metropolitan Asylum Board should, in the opinion of this Board, be constituted the central and sole authority to make provision for the reception and treatment from all classes of the population of persons suffering from infectious disease, and that the present law should be amended accordingly. posed New street. A Parliamentary Plan and Notices were, in November last, deposited of the "Southwark Bridge Road and Great Dover Street Communication," described as follows:—"A New Street commencing in the Southwark Bridge Road near its junction with Peter Street, in the Parishes of St. Saviour and St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, or one of them, a,nd continued thence across Queen Street and Duke Street to Red Cross Street, and further extended by the widening of Mint Street, partly on its north-east and partly on its south-west sides, and terminating in Blackman Street at its junction with Mint Street, in the Parish of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, all in the Parishes of St. Saviour and St. George-theMartyr, Southwark, in the County of Surrey." This Board, as stated in its last Annual Report, has cordially approved of the project, considering that the formation of such a thoroughfare would tend to the relief of London Bridge by diverting a portion of the traffic in a new direction, and supply a means of communication with the Borough, at present greatly needed. A Bill for authorizing the same is now before Parliament, and is expected shortly to receive the roval assent. 7 A Contract has been entered into by Mr. Reddin for Watering Watering. during the present season, as will be seen on reference to the list of Contracts at page 39.

Gentlemen, I have this evening the pleasure of presenting to you my Twenty-first Annual Report on the Sanitary transactions of the year, together with such remarks as have suggested themselves to me in reference to the causes of disease and the best and surest method of counteracting them. During the past year there were 658 deaths in the district,— 368 persons died in Christchurch and 290 in St. Saviour's. Of those who died in Christchurch 110 died in the workhouse, a large proportion of them having previously resided in other parts of the district. There were 496 births in Christchurch and 580 in St. Saviour's. It will probably be observed that Christchurch, although the smaller parish, presents a larger list of deaths than St. Saviour's. This is explained by the fact that Christchurch Workhouse receives a large proportion of aged men from the entire Union, which is comprised of Christchurch, St. Saviour's, St. George's, and Newington. It is encouraging to find a comparison with the RegistrarGeneral's Report, just issued shows the death rate of mortality per 1000 of persons at all ages living in London was 22.3, while in St. Saviour's District it was 21.5, or nearly one death per 1000 in our favour; but by far the most gratifying feature in the Report is the extraordinary reduction of deaths from epidemic diseases as compared with my last Report. In 1875, 78 deaths occurred in Christchurch and 104 in St. Saviour's from zymotic diseases, making a total of 182. Last year there were 38 deaths in Christchurch and an exact number in St. Saviour's, making a total of 76, and the marvellous reduction of 106 during the year. The 9 chief reduction has been in measles, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, and diarrhoea. In 1875, of the two former diseases, there were respectively 43 and 55. In the past year, only 14 fatal cases in both parishes. I have appended a table showing the exact reduction in each class of these diseases. general statement—epidemic diseases. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diptheria. Hooping Cough. Enteric or Typhoid. Simple or Continued Fever. Diarrhoea.

Although it may be considered somewhat irregular in a Report for last year to anticipate the results of the present, yet, as it is notorious that small-pox is now more prevalent in London than it has been for many years, I take this opportunity of repeating words of warning and advice. It is incontestable that in vaccination and re-vaccination we possess a safeguard against both its virulence and its approach, and that it is due to the neglect of one or other of these precautions that we are periodically visited with outbreaks of this disease in an epidemic form. On a former occasion I directed attention to the conclusive fact that the statistics of the Small-pox Hospital for 10 years, prove that, of vaccinated persons, 7 per cent. die, while of those not vaccinated the percentage of deaths is 36. lie-vaccination should, in all cases, be performed at the age of puberty; and it is my firm 10 conviction, that, if these measures are properly observed, small-pox will become extinct amongst us. I am glad to observe that the Guardians have appointed a most able and energetic officer whose sole duty is to take care that every child bom in the Districts is properly vaccinated. The following is a statement of all the deaths from various causes which occurred during the year. CHRIST CHURCH. ST. SAVIOUR'S.

Water Supply. In ray Monthly Reports I have drawn your attention to the Water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall and Lambeth Companies to this District. I now quote Dr. Frankland, who states—"The deep-well water distributed by the Kent Company continues to be distinguished from the other supplies by containing a less proportion of organic matter, and, on this account, is again taken as the standard for comparison in the following table. Taking the amount of organic elements (organic carbon and organic nitrogen) found in it during the past year as unity, the maximum, minimum, and average pro- 11 portions in each of the other seven Metropolitan waters supplied during 1876 were as follows:— Sources. Maximum. Minimum. Average. Deep Wells Kent 1.0 1.0 1.0 River Lea New River 3.3 0.9 1.9 East London 4.0 1.7 2.8 Thames West Middlesex 6.7 1.8 3.3 Grand Junction 7.6 1.9 3.6 Chelsea 7.0 1.9 3.9 Lambeth 6.2 1.7 4.0 Southwark 9.5 2.0 4.4 This table shows that whilst all the river waters are, on the average, of a much lower quality than the deep-well water of the Kent Company, the degree of their impurity varies between wide limits; thus, the maximum proportion of organic impurity in the Southwark Company's water was nearly three times as great as that in the New River Company's supply. Gas Examination. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied by the Phoenix Company, as tested by Letheby's Photometer, according to the requirements of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, was equal to 14.4 sperm candles. The highest illuminating power was equal to 15.8, and the lowest 13.8 candles. The average illuminating power was rather higher than during the preceding year; occasionally traces of ammonia were present; sulphuretted hydrogen was never detected. I purpose to conclude this Report by referring to a matter which requires urgent attention, it relates to the necessity of stringent legislative measures to compel the public to act promptly in the interests of the whole community. As the Act now stands, a case of infectious disease is brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health circuitously, or, perhaps, not at all. The householder, in many cases, is anxious it should not be known that any occupant or servant in his house is suffering from a contagious disease, on account of injury to his business or otherwise, so that the malady is kept secret until either the disease spreads or death occurs, when it is too late to render efficient assistance. 12 The Medical Attendant should, in every case of infectious disease, be required to notify to the occupier of a house, that he must immediately (say within 24 hours) give notice to the Sanitary Authority of the existence of such disease. It is certain that diseases of an infectious character may be arrested and prevented from spreading by adopting proper precautions, but, in order to accomplish this, and to enable the Medical Officer of Health to put in operation the measures which sanitary science has discovered, it is of the utmost importance that he should be informed of their existence at the first onset. Of course there are certain details which would necessarily follow in the operation of this enactment, such as penalties for concealing the existence of infectious diseases, the means to be provided by sanitary authorities for the removal of patients, and other matters of minor importance. I have appended a table of Inspections and Sanitary Work done in the District, whereby it will be seen your Inspector of Nuisances has displayed his usual intelligence and activity.

Gentlemen, In continuation of the Annual Reports hitherto furnished, I have again put together the results of the work done between 1st April, 1876, and the end of March, 1877. The number of Analyses which I have made is 105, besides 17 in duplicate, or 122 in all. In every case of adulteration, or even suspicion of adulteration, the analysis has been repeated. Milk Analysis has been systematically carried on. Out of 54 samples, eight were magisterially decided; but the number of convictions does not represent the number of adulterations. One of the grossest cases, No. 111, was not prosecuted, and several vendors were only warned. Although the labour of the analysis is considerably increased thereby, I have always adopted the plan of estimating the amount of ash in a milk, and of the salt in the ash. Unless this is done, the judgment of the quality of the so-called "solids not fat," which term includes the sugar as well as the casein of milk, is unfair. The general result is a decrease in the amount of adulteration of milk, and a proof, if proof were wanted, that water is the only common adulteration. But how important it is to follow up the system of analysis is seen by the mischief that can be occasioned by poisoned water! The admixture of tap-water from known London water-companies, even when the supply is good, is always liable to contamination by sewer-gas, owing to the intermittent water supply and the position of the cisterns; but water from country farms is often proved to be the more dangerous addition. As to the abstraction of Cream, whether of intention or not, the difficulty of proof is very great. In all cases of doubt I have given the vendor the benefit. 18 In spite of adulteration then, there is very much milk of firstrate quality sold in the district of St. Saviour's, and the improvement can be testified to by Mr. Bianchi as well as by myself. As to Bread and Flour, only two specimens of each have been examined; they were found to be of excellent quality, and free from admixture of foreign materials. The same may be said of a sample of Oatmeal. Of eight Arrowroots, six were genuine and two admixed. With reference to the taking of samples I may mention a case in which portions taken from the same canister may be genuine and spurious, in distinct patches. Such a sample we had in the Midsummer quarter, as I was able to convince a wholesale dealer. Butters, four in number, have been submitted to analysis, and the results shewed them to be of the nature and quality demanded by the Act. But I must repeat what I have said in some former Report, that a butter is often genuine when it is so nasty that one wonders at people's want of taste. I am quite pleased that I am not called upon to condemn some of the so-called "butters" which are largely sold, as they are incomparably superior to much of the genuine article as regards wholesomeness, taste, smell, and appearance. The only part of the business that is bad is the sale of such fats at an unfair price as butter. Let them be sold as imitations, and the price might be lowered some 30 per cent. at once. Of Coffees, two samples were taken. One was genuine and the other contained only a suspicion of chicory. Considering how large is the quantity of chicory contained in some mixtures sold as coffees, I would strongly advise the community to mix for themselves. Of a sample of Tea I have nothing to report, nor of a Pepper, a Vinegar, and four Mustards, except that they were all good. Of Preserves I have had no specimens. The Preserved Peas which have created so great a sensation, I only know about through the application of one of the wholesale vendors who wished me to defend the sale of them. I may be allowed to mention that no salt of copper, however small the quantity, should be passed over, 19 when admittedly introduced for the sake of colour. The Lancet did good work in this direction many years since, and it is owing to the labours of Dr. Hassall and others that Pickles and Preserves are now generally sold without the green colouring matter communicated by copper salts. The effects of copper upon the system are cumulative like those of lead, and a very interesting illustration of the influence of the latter is furnished by the following case. A man was brought into a London Hospital afflicted with some of the worst symptoms of lead-paralysis. For some time the physician in attendance could not in any way account for the man's illness, as he was not connected with painters' or any other work in which lead or lead-salts Were employed. At length it oozed out that the man, in going to his daily work, stopped every morning early at the same publichouse, and had a draught of "dog's-nose," a mixture of ale and gin. The latter, having been in the pipes all night, was just sufficiently poisoned by a minute trace of lead, as, in time, by its cumulative effects, to produce paralysis. The moral is obvious. It shows too, among other things, that the fittings of a publichouse are not unimportant, and that the mention of traces of lead in a gin or rum should not be disregarded. "With regard to Spirits, I have examined five specimens of Gins, and three of Whiskeys. I have not met with any of the adulterations which were said to be so common. There is often an admixture of water which I should only condemn when the amount of proof spirit was supposed to be a fixed quantity. How great the variations in alcohol, reckoned as proof spirit, may be, the following statements will prove:— No. 61 Whiskey 77.52 per cent. No. 59 „ 71.39 „ No. 3 „ 61.50 „ No. 62 Gin 62.05 „ No. 2 „ 60.09 No. 97 „ 57.59 „ No. 96 „ 52.49 „ No. 60 „ 51.91 „ 20 The sweetening of the Gins is often very misleading, covering as it does the alcoholic contents; but I find the sugar added always of first-rate quality. The alcohol of the Whiskeys is not so pure as that from the Gins. And now a word as to Drugs. At my request Mr. Errington has taken several samples. A specimen of Sulphate of Quinine, one of Carbonate of Magnesia, and one of Dilute Sulphuric Acid were excellent of their kind. With reference to Milk of Sulphur, the sample was found to contain 10 per cent. of sulphate of lime; but as there was no suspicion that this substance had been added, the vendor was informed of its presence, so that he might guide himself as to future purchases. In this drug there is a great improvement since the Act came into force, in my experience the Sulphate of Lime having been reduced from 60 to 10 percent.; it may be reasonably expected soon to be a matter of history, as is the case with so many adulterations. In another case, No. 121, I found the so-called Trisnitrate of Bismuth containing some Basic Carbonate of Bismuth, and that it had been so dried by overheating, as to be very little use as a drug. It would not be likely to be absorbed into the system, and would therefore disappoint the administrator. Of course the carbonate ought not to have been present; but as the actual amount of Bismuth was greater than usual, and the Bismuth itself was of perfect purity, I recommended that the fact should be mentioned to the salesman. From my own experience as to drugs and chemicals, I know how difficult it is to obtain them pure, even when the best price is paid, unless one has direct dealings with the manufacturers; and I must express the great satisfaction I feel in your permission that I should exercise my judgment as to whether an article be of the nature and quality demanded. Of Confectionery I have analyzed three samples, Spanish Juice, Conversation Lozenges, and Sugared Almonds. The Licorice was 21 much improved in quality. The Sugared Almonds alone arc worthy of remark, as affording an illustration of the want of discrimination or the poverty of choice on the part of the purchasers. The Almonds were broken, dirty, musty, but richly tinted with carmine, and thus rendered tempting to the eyes of children. On the whole, however, I have the satisfaction to report progress, and I trust that you yourselves will consider the working of the Act as satisfactory as could be, at present, expected.
