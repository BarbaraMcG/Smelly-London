(6) WATER SUPPLY. > The water for the district is supplied by the Barnet District Gas and Water Company and the Colne Valley Water Company. With regard to the Barnet District Gas and Water Company, all the water is chlorinated, ana a pathological staff is maintained. The water, in bulk, is examined daily and each pumping station once a week. 1,501 examinations of the water were made during the year, i.e. 207 Chemical and 1,294 Bacteriological. Of the Bacteriological samples, 1,206 were representative of supply and the percentage of first class (i.e. B. Coli absent in 100 millilitres), was 98.7. In addition to the above 32 Chemical and 60 Bacteriological examinations were made by Dr. Suckling of the Counties Public Health Laboratories and all samples were reported free of B. Coli in 100 millilitres. The Colne Valley Water Company exercises constant supervision and members of the staff are on duty day and night throughout the year, examining samples. All the water supplied by this Company is chlorinated. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE. The Town is drained and sewered on the separate system, excepting the older portions of the district where a combined system obtains. The sewage is conveyed to an Irrigation Farm of 56 acres, but before it is turned on the land it is screened and treated by means of detritus and sedimentation tanks, and three rotary filters. Pumping is necessary for three sewers which have their outlets at a low point on the farm. A few outlying properties are drained to cesspools, and part of Totteridge to the Finchley Borough Sewers, There are only a few earth closets in remote parts of the district. SANITARY CONDITIONS AND WATER SUPPLY OF SCHOOLS. There are eight public elementary schools in the district, viz:- Arkley Church of England Infants School; Byng Road County Council School (Junior Mixed and Infants and Senior Mixed Departments); Christ Church School, with Boys, Girls and Infants Departments; Barnet Church of England School (Senior Mixed Department) Totteridge Church of England School, (Boys, Girls and Infants); Grasvenor Avenue, (Infants); St. Catherine's Roman Catholic Mixed School; and Underbill County Council School, (Junior Mixed Department and Infants Department). The Assistant School Medical Officer resides in the district and visits each School at least once each term. He is in constant touch with the teachers, and all doubtful cases of illness are at once referred to him. Infectious cases and contacts are excluded from the Schools and disinfections are carried out when necessary. (7) DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The house refuse is collected weekly in covered mechanical conveyances and conveyed to the Farm and disposed of by the controlled tipping system. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER.

CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT. Public Health Department, 10 Wood Street, Barnet. To the Chairman and Members of the Barnet Urban District Council. Mrs. Strugnell and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report giving particulars of the measures carried out in my Department during the year 1940, in administering the Health Acts and Bye-Lars in force in the District. Owing to reduction in Staff, and to the large amount of work the Department is responsible for in connection with the Civil Defence Casualty Services, it has not been possible to do more than submit my report in a very condensed form, as compared with those of previous years. It is, therefore, in the main a statistical report. INSPECTION OF DISTRICT. General Inspections of the District have been carried out from time to time and all complaints investigated. The course of serving a preliminary or intimation notice upon the person in default, specifying the works necessary to abate the nuisance, continues to be followed, and only if a person fails to comply with this preliminary notice, or strict legal procedure is necessary in the first instance, is the matter reported to the Council and a statutory notice asked for. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936. INFECTIOUS DISEASES - INVESTIGATIONS AND DISINFECTIONS. The Infectious Diseases enumerated below have been investigated and reported upon to your Medical Officer of Health:- Scarlet Fever 50; Diphtheria 6; Erysipelas 13; and Pulmonary Tuberculosis 19. Fifty-three houses were disinfected wherein cases of Notifiable Infectious Diseases occurred, and bedding sent to be steam disinfected in certain cases. In addition one house was disinfected on request, after a case of nonnotifiable diseo.se. In such a case a charge of 5/- is made to cover labour and material. One hundred and. fifty-six library books from infectious houses were disinfected or destroyed. DAIRIESCOWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. The number of persons registered to sell milk is twenty-seven, viz;10 Dairies and Cowsheds. 17 Milkshops and Purveyors of Milk. Thirty-one inspections were made, and particular attention paid to the hygienic essentials necessary for a pure milk production and distribution. Eleven Licences were granted to sell milk under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936, viz:- Tuberculin Tested 5 Accredited 1 Pasteurised 5 SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS ACT. 1933. There are twenty persons licensed by the Council as fit persons to slaughter animals in the district as compared with nineteen in the previous year. No complaint was received concerning the conduct of any of these men. Slaughter houses are also visited by an Inspector of the R.S.P.C.A., who holds an honorary appointment under the Council, thus giving him power to enter slaughter houses in order to see that animals are humanely slaughtered. MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION. In the early part of the year the four slaughter houses in the district were closed for the duration of the war and centralised slaughtering centres set up by the Ministry of Food as part of the scheme for meat rationing. Up to the time the slaughter houses were closed, 45 cattle, 77 calves, 79 sheep and lambs, and 52 pigs were inspected. The carcase of one pig was found to be slightly affected with Tuberculosis, The affected parts were destroyed. In addition 6 lbs. of Pork and 60 lbs. of frozen rabbits were destroyed as being unfit for human consumption. Particulars of foodstuffs condemned as unfit for food due to enemy action will be the subject of report at a later date. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 1938. The above Act is enforced by the County Authority in this district. The following table shows the number and nature of the samples taken in the Urban District of Barnet, with the results of the analyses.

Three "Appeal to Cow" samples were taken from the producer concerned and as these were found to be low in fat no legal action was taken. DRAINAGE AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The drains or sanitary fittings of 98 premises were found to be in some respect defective. In 3 cases it was found necessary to take up and entirely relay the drains. In 60 cases drains were found to be stopped up. 52 water closets, 1 sink, 63 water closet cisterns, 31 inspection chambers and 5 soil pipes were renewed or repaired. 1 cesspool was abolished. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT. 1936. SECTION 75. Twenty-eight dustbins were provided after intimation to replace worn out receptacles, or absence of same. The provision of a proper sanitary dustbin is a very useful health measure. It also secures uniformity of receptacle and makes the task of the dustmen cleaner and easier. WATER SUPPLY. 385 cases of burst pipes occurred at the commencement of the year and repairs were carried out to same. In 8 cases the water was cut off owing to the non-payment of rates. This department was notified by the Barnet District Gas and Water Company, and steps were taken which resulted in the early reconnection of the supply. (5) FACTORIES ACT. 1937. 32 inspections of factories with mechanical power and 12 inspections of factories without mechanical power were made during the year, including bake-houses. Two notices were served on the occupiers of bake-houses for defects contravening the special sanitary sections of the Act. Three Certificates of adequate means of escape in case of fire were issued by the Council under Section 34 of the Act. INSANITARY PROPERTY. The Potteries. and Nos. 1, 2 and 3 Potteries Cottages. These premises were condemned as unfit for human habitation. As the Council had previously purchased the above property, steps were then taken to have the premises vacated. On vacation of the property the houses were demolished by the Council. HOUSING ACT 1935 - OVERCROWDING. As a result of the war it has been difficult to administer the provisions of the above Act with regard to overcrowding. An effort has, however, been made to prevent any serious overcrowding. Surveys have been carried out in respect of 62 houses, and these, together with those surveyed in previous years, make a total 3,590 on the files of the department, from which a new start can be made after the war. APPLICATIONS FOR COUNCIL HOUSES, These numbered 157 at the end of the year, 44 applicants from this list were provided with houses. In addition, 16 local bombed families were given tenancies and arrangements were made whereby two further such families became sub-tenants for the period of the war in the absence of the proper tenants. PETROLEUM CONSOLIDATION ACT 1928. There are thirty-three persons licensed to store petroleum upon the Register, as against thirty-four last year. The licences are for varying quantities from 100 gallons to 6,000 gallons. The total quantity of petroleum spirit which may be kept in the various stores is 29,248 gallons, as against 32,450 gallons last year. Thirty-nine inspections were made, but there was no serious breach of Regulations to report. (6) Tanks placed underground and supplying by means of pumps have practically taken the place of cans, and are much safer. These tanks and pumps now number 51. One licence was issued for storage of 112 lbs. of Carbide of Calcium. The scale of fees for licences to store petroleum ranges from 5/- for a quantity not exceeding 100 gallons., to £1 for a 1,000 - 5,000 gallons. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS.

(3) Where there is reason bo believe that the incoming tenant of a Council house is not too clean, and that the furniture is likely to be infested, an inspection is made and the furniture disinfested if necessary. (4) The work of disinfeetation of houses belonging to the Council is carried cut by the Housing Department Repairs Staff under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector. The Council do not undertake the work of disinfestation for private house owners, but give all facilities they can to help them. I am, Yours obediently, CHARLES WILLIAM HILL, M.S.I.A.
