Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you for your consideration a report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1960. Having taken over duties as Medical Officer of Health on 1st July 1960, I am privileged to submit my first Annual Report. You will realise, of course, that during the first half of 1960 Dr. W. Stott was Acting Medical Officer and I must acknowledge that the work of the Public Health Department was under his wise direction during this period and that in September 1960 he was appointed Deputy Medical Officer. The report follows the pattern of previous years and this facilitates easy reference and comparison. From the various sections you will be able to see the work that was carried on by your Health Department. May I extend my thanks to members of the Council and to the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year, also to all members of the staff for their help and loyal support. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. E. EPSOM. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA The area of the borough (exclusive of area covered by water) is 1,336 acres.

The National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951 also provides for a magistrate to order the emergency removal of such persons to a hospital or institution for a period not exceeding twenty one days, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and a general medical practitioner. Fortunately, it is only in exceptional cases that such action is necessary and then only when persuasive efforts have failed. During the year under report the Council made application for committal orders in respect of three persons whose condition had had been giving cause for concern and none of whom was prepared to enter a hospital or home for the elderly on a voluntary basis. Details are given below. Mrs. E. T., aged 85, had been visited regularly since December 1957 and it was noted that her confused mental state had resulted in a marked deterioration in her personal cleanliness. It was subsequently reported by the warden of the home to which she was committed that her condition had warranted her transfer to a mental hospital for treatment. Mrs. A. G., aged 58, occupied two top floor rooms in a terrace house and her accommodation was found to be in a filthy condition. The death of her son in a Japanese prison camp and unhappy family associations had contributed to a confused mental state which had necessitated treatment in a mental hospital. Her condition had not improved despite efforts by her daughter to induce her mother to take an interest in life, and it was considered there was no alternative but to apply for a committal order in view of her unwillingness to enter a home voluntarily and her apparent refusal to reside with her daughter. On expiry of the statutory period of twenty one days it was reported by the warden of the home that Mrs. G had been admitted to a mental hospital for treatment. She has since discharged herself and is living with her daughter. Mrs. F. H., aged 86, was visited at the request of relatives who were concerned about her physical condition. Apart from the insanitary state of her accommodation and her lack of personal cleanliness, it was observed that she was mentally confused and evidently incapable of caring for herself adequately. It was discovered that she has never been registered with a doctor and after a local practitioner was contacted he agreed to accept her as his patient. He diagnosed senile dementia and cerebral arterio sclerosis and agreed to countersign the necessary application for a committal order. It was afterwards reported by the Welfare Officer at the home to which she had been admitted that Mrs. H. had settled in well and had agreed to reside there permanently. During the course of the year, ten old people agreed voluntarily to be admitted to hospital or homes for the elderly, and the necessary arrangements were made. One of these cases was that of an old man, aged 78, whose living conditions were drawn to the attention of the department by a general practitioner. The patient was living alone in a three room flat which was in a very dirty condition, the furniture having been heaped together in the corners of rooms, and his physical condition was such that he was persuaded to enter hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the patient was so ill that he died the following day. Section 50 It is the responsibility of the Council, under this section of the Act, to arrange for the burial or cremation of a person dying in the Borough where there are no relatives, or others, who would be prepared to make the funeral arrangements. The Council's expenses in such cases, inclusive of an administrative charge, are recoverable from the deceased's estate, where appropriate. During the course of the year, three burials were arranged at the request of the Coroner's Officer and particulars of these cases are given hereunder: Mr. J. L. died in a Common Lodging House and it was not possible to trace any relatives. There were no effects, apart from the sum of £3 found on the body, and the Council's costs, less this amount were written off as irrecoverable. Mr. H. D. A., who had had no regular employment or permanent address, was found dead in disused stables. His wife, from whom he had been separated for some 25 years, was traced by the police and she informed the Coroner's Officer that she was financially incapable of meeting the funeral expenses. She subsequently intimated, however, that she would be able to contribute £5 towards the Council's costs and this offer was accepted. Mr. R. G. L. was accidentally gassed in his flat and funeral arrangements were made in the absence of known relatives. The Council's costs were recovered from the estate. Apart from these cases, the body of a male person was conveyed to the mortuary after recovery from the Thames. Funeral arrangements were made by relatives. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT 1936, SECTION 122 The Council are authorised to remove and cleanse personal effects where the Medical Officer considers that the condition of such articles is likely to cause the spread of infectious disease. During the year, the Medical Officer visited the homes of 41 old people who were seriously ill or senile. Quantities of soiled bedding and personal clothing were found in each case and it was necessary for these articles to be regularly collected for cleansing in the Disinfecting Station and returned to the owners. REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE SURVEY OF OLD PEOPLE During 1960 details required by the survey have been obtained from 1,374 elderly people, which again shows an increase over those for the previous year (1,014 in 1959) and brings the total number of cases registered during the four years of the survey to 4,095 as follows:- Table 1—Age and sex distribution Living Deceased Age Male Female (or age at death) Male Female 50—60 27 70 3 7 61—65 58 253 9 9 520 25 29 66—70 219 71—75 300 621 43 66 76—80 259 544 62 77 81—90 169 411 80 125 27 4 19 91 plus 12 1,044 2,446 226 332 Totals: Total (all columns) 4,048 Plus cases moved away or entered homes 47 4,095 of the 558 deaths, 386 occurred in hospital. The figures, in the main, seem to be following the previous pattern, although the proportion of men to women shows a slight increase. The Public Health Assistants are experiencing some difficulty in finding the occupiers at home at numerous addresses and have to rely on information from neighbours, which sometimes inadvertently proves to be false, as there are still many elderly persons living in houses and flats whose existence is unknown to their neighbours. There are, too, the females who will not admit to themselves that they are 60, and would certainly not let other people know. A few of both sexes refuse information altogether. Apart from these difficulties, there is no reason why, ultimately, the survey should not produce realistic figures on which the Committee can plan for the future. Table II —Mobility The importance of mobility cannot be over-emphasized and there is no doubt that the many and varied social activities arranged for the elderly in Bermondsey by voluntary clubs and otherwise does much to encourage them to be "out and about". In the Municipal Club members are often heard to say "I wasn't coming out to-day but I didn't want to miss the whist drive, Old Time Dancing Class (or some other activity)". The Workrooms have done a great deal to keep many old people mobile who would almost certainly have hibernated and in a very short-time become bedbound, which is inevitably followed by hospitalisation. Male Female Housebound Bedbound Housebound Bedbound Age Mobile Mobile 50 — 60 20 5 2 47 20 3 61—65 52 6 240 - 13 - 66—70 204 14 1 488 31 1 71—75 278 22 - 560 59 2 76—80 239 17 3 460 79 5 81—90 139 29 1 295 107 9 91+ 11 1 - 11 16 - 943 94 7 2,101 325 20 Total The house-bound and bed-bound categories, although small in number, demand a considerable amount of attention and it is essential continually to ensure that the services necessary in many cases; nursing, home help, meals service, incontinent laundry service, library service and others, function satisfactorily. Table III—Isolation The problem of the elderly who live alone is one which calls for priority in our work. This class often feel that they are no longer wanted and lose interest in their homes and personal cleanliness, and cease to prepare proper food for themselves. They are often unaware of their deterioration and it is difficult in some cases to bring it to their notice. Others are aware and try to hide behind closed doors. Both types need very careful handling and constant visiting so that their personal confidence can be regained. Here, too, the clubs are a great blessing.

Table IV—Utilisation of Welfare Services Throughout the year an average of 90 meals a day has been supplied to elderly, homebound people by the Meals on Wheels Service. Approximately 42 old people per week have been bathed, either in their own homes or at the Disinfecting Station, and an average of 60 old people per week have had bedding and personal clothing cleansed by the Laundry Service. The persons availing themselves of these services are often in need for only short periods; they are, therefore, ever-changing, and it would be of little value to show them in age groups.

Bishop (has also performed relief duties at Municipal Club) 1,448 Mrs. N. Witherden 734 Mr. W. White 2,864 7.046 Conclusions The number of house-bound and bed-bound is very small and every effort is being made, by utilising the services available, to keep these unfortunates out of the chronic sick wards of the hospitals. The voluntary clubs are doing excellent work in giving their members many and varied interests and are most helpful in letting me know when one of their number has not been seen around for a time, or if deterioration is evident. The Municipal Club, likewise, is most useful in this direction but, alas, is now getting so overcrowded that some members are staying away. The success of this venture makes it imperative that the Committee should consider planning not only for an extension of the existing Club, but also for a similar project in another part of the Borough, for the future. The final phase of the survey may take some time as those at present "outside the net" may be the most difficult to find. The three Public Health Assistants can now plan periodic visits to all known cases, the frequency of the visits being determined by the need. By this means it is hoped to cut down the number of elderly people found dead or seriously ill in their homes. Municipal Club Now that the Club has entered its third year, it is gratifying to note that enrolled membership has continued to rise and is now 390, the average weekly attendance being 360. The normal weekly programme of whist drives, Old Time Dancing Classes and film shows was extended in the Autumn by the formation of an Arts and Crafts Class, which embraces basketry, embroidery, and the making of soft toys, calendars and Christmas Cards. This class has proved extremely popular with the old people. With the co-operation of the Libraries Committee, since the beginning of the year the services of a mobile library have been made available to members, and this service has been greatly appreciated by them. As an experiment, monthly evening socials were held during the early months of the year, and these were very popular. Many trips to West End theatres and cinemas were organised throughout the year, for which members were able to take advantage of specially reduced seating prices. Amongst the various games played by members, darts is one which hitherto has been mostly confined to the men, but lately, the ladies, too, have started playing, and friendly matches are arranged between them. A dartboard surround with scoring panels was kindly donated to the Club by a firm of brewers. A local trader generously undertook to loan the Club a television set on those occasions when items of general interest were being televised, such as the Royal Wedding earlier in the year, and members have been very pleased to take advantage of this. The Annual Outing of the Club and Workrooms, which this year was to Southsea, took place on Monday, 27th June, 145 members attending. The coaches left the Public Health Centre at 8.30 a.m., arriving at Southsea just before lunch at 1 p.m., which was provided in the Castle Restaurant. The meal was very good indeed and was greatly enjoyed. The cost was 5/9d. per head but it was possible to provide it free of charge to members, and also to give them 2/6d. towards the cost of tea, for which they made their own arrangements. Members rejoined the coaches at 6 p.m. for the return journey, after a very enjoyable day. Music on the coaches was provided by a member of the staff. Many outings were arranged during the spring and summer, which included a day trip to Southend on one of the Eagle Steamers, a conducted tour of the Guinness Brewery at Park Royal and also Huntley & Palmer's factory at Reading. Hopfields tours were arranged during the season and also a trip to Southend to see the illuminations. Visits have been made to several Women's Institutes in the country and, on one of these to Bolney, Sussex, members were conducted over a local farm where pedigree cattle are reared and were able to see some of the general running of the farm, which they found very interesting. Return visits to the Club were made by parties from the Women's Institutes, all of whom showed great interest in the activities of the Club and the welfare of the members. Club members have always shown great interest in the Annual Flower Show organised by the Gardens Section, and it is gratifying to report that Club entries were awarded first prize in the Floral Decorations section and third prizes in each of the sections for Cage Birds and Special Plants. Towards the end of the year a Bring and Buy Sale was organised to raise funds for the Annual Christmas Party, which was held on 21st December in the large Libraries Hall. The Mayor and Mayoress very kindly accepted an invitation and attended with the Vice- Chairman of the Council for the Welfare of Old People. Carols were sung during tea by girls from the Aylwin School, and entertainments during the evening included a concert party, Old Time Dancing, a sing-song, and games, for which prizes were given. Each old person received a gift, and also a bag of fruit and sweets on leaving. The evening was a great success and was thoroughly enjoyed by all concerened. During ihe year, the Workrooms have undertaken many and varied contracts, which have included the production of various types of folders, postcard albums and braids for braces, the assembly and packing of nose-pieces for skin diving apparatus, and the packing of fancy goods, etc., for various companies according to seasonal demand. It must be stated that the value of the Workrooms is twofold, insofar as it not only enables the old people to add their modest incomes but affords them the reassurance of knowing that they are continuing to lead a purposeful and active life in the community. It would not be practicable to record individually all the acts of generosity and donations of money and services made to the Club by various individuals and organisations during the past year, but for all these the gratitude and appreciation of Club members is recorded, and also for the continued interest in the activities of their Club. The Council continued to act as agents for the Council for the Welfare of Old People in the operation of the Meals on Wheels Service and the Meals Service provided for the Municipal Club. The following table sets out the number of meals supplied monthly during the year.

Special aids and fireguards have also been obtained from the London County Council for the use of the physically handicapped. During the year wireless sets for the use of 21 homebound persons were obtained from the Society for the Provision of Wireless for the Homebound, and, through the generosity of a local trader, television sets were made available to three homebound, old people, for which the costs of the licenses have also been kindly met by the Society. Clothing, also, was provided for many old people throughout the year by the Women's Voluntary Service on the recommendation of the Department's Public Health Assistants.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH The Borough Council completed 172 flats, 529 were in course of erection at the end of the year and plans for 447 were prepared or in course of preparation. 261 families from the waiting list, clearance areas etc. have been rehoused and 182 transfers and exchanges were arranged. This has resulted in 443 families being provided with improved accommodation by the Borough Council. 402 families were rehoused by the London County Council and 18 families were accommodated in new towns. 3 E.F.M. Bungalows were demolished during the year and 137 remain.

Where a consignment showed a plate count of between 250,000 and 2,000,000 the importer was warned that the prawns must be used immediately after defrosting. No organisms of the Salmonella or Dysentery groups were found in any of the samples taken. DESICCATED COCONUT 409 samples of Desiccated Coconut were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, 407 being from consignments from Ceylon and the remaining 2 from a consignment from the Phillipines. Salmonella organisms were found in 13 of the samples of Ceylonese coconut examined and the types of contamination were as follows:- Salmonella senftenberg 1 Salmonella waycross 3 Salmonella nchanga 5 Salmonella ferlac 4 D1 (42) SAMPLING OF EGG PRODUCTS 1960 Sampling of egg products to determine possible contamination by Salmonella organisms was continued during 1960. In order to obtain a punctual examination and rapid decision, the importers paid for a considerable number of samples to be examined. The method of sampling was by batch numbers (signifying packing dates and factories). Where a sample showed evidence of contamination the whole batch was placed under detention and later either re-exported or released for pasteurisation and high temperature baking. The main importations were of frozen whole egg of which the chief exporters were Australia, China and South Africa and laboratory results showed that 9·2% of the samples taken from these consignments contained Salmonellae. The total number of samples from all egg products found to be contaminated was 440 and the following table shows the type of contamination:- No.of samples Salmonella aberdeen 21 Salmonella anatum 9 Salmonella bareilly 37 Salmonella bloemfontein 1 Salmonella bovis morbificans 4 Salmonella Cambridge 1 Salmonella derby 2 Salmonella dublin 1 Salmonella enteritidis 1 Salmonella heidelberg 1 Salmonella hessarek 1 Salmonella meleagridis 1 Salmonella meleagridis and potsdam 1 Salmonella mikawasima 7 Salmonella mississippi 1 Salmonella montevideo 2 Salmonella muenchen 1 Salmonella newport 7 Salmonella norwich 1 Salmonella nyborg 2 Salmonella paratyphi B. 75 Salmonella potsdam 30 Salmonella st.
