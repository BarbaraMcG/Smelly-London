TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OP THE VESTRY of tiie parish of ST, JAMES AND ST, JOHN, CLKHKENWELL, FOR TIIE YEAR 1880-1. Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18th and 19th Vict., cap. ll>0. LONDON: W. J. GOODE, PRINTER, 23, ST. JOHN'S LANE, CLERKENWELL. 1881. REPORT OF THE VESTRY For the Year ending 25th March, 1881. The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell beg to present the following Report of the principal matters which have formed their proceedings under the Metropolis local Management Act, and other Acts which are administered by them during the year ending on the 25th March, 1881. Rates.— During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows: — For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1880. A Poor Rate of 1s. 7d.in the £ estimated to realize £21,850 A Sewer ,, 4d. ,, „ 4,600 A Lighting,, 1d. „ „ „ 1,150 A General „ l1d. „ „ „ 12,650 2/11 £40,250 For the half year to Lady-day, 1881. A Poor Rate of 1s. 3d. in the £ estimated to realize £17,550 A Main drainage Rate of 1d. „ „ „ 1,170 A Lighting „ 1d. „ „ „ 1,170 A General „ l/l „ „ „ 15,210 2/6 £35,100 The Rates made in April for the half-year to Michaelmas were based upon a rateable value of £296,824, and those for the half-year to Lady-day, 1881, on a rateable value of £298,616. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £23,161 in the first, and £18,660 in the second halfyear, towards which the Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £2,605 6s. 6d., and £4,566 17a. 8d. in the first and second half-years respectively. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year amounted to £7,581 2s. 10d„ and that of the School Board to £7,436 9s. 8d. 4 The Police precepts for the year amounted to £5,880. It will thus be seen that, of the £75,350 raised during the year, the sum of £44,058, or considerably more than half, was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. Assessment —The year was marked by the general quinquennial valuation of the Metropolis, under the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. The Assessment Committee sat 18 days from the 6th of April to the 21st of May for some six hours each day, and completed the re-assessment on the latter date. A special feature of the assessment was the action taken with regard to the rating of public-houses. It was considered that the premiums paid for public-houses were, in part, only another name for rent paid in advance, and therefore one-third of the premium, ascertained or estimated, was in all cases assessed at five per cent, and added to the rental, &c., to make up the gross assessment. This principle of including a portion of the premium value had already been adopted elsewhere, and was upheld at the Union Assessment Committee, although many of the assessments were reduced on appeal; but in the case of the " Clown" Public-house, St. John Street Road, where the Union Assessment Committee had reduced the gross value from £205 to £166, the Vestry appealed to the Special Sessions against such decision, and succeeded in getting the original value restored. The works of the Metropolitan Railway Company, the New River Company, the Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Alexandra Palace Railway Company, were placed in the hands of Messrs. Castle & Son for re-valuation, and their valuations were as follows :— Metropolitan Railway Gross. Rateable. Gross. Rateable Company, raised from £17,000 12,750 to £28,356 25,460 New River Coy ,, 10,200 8,500 12,917 11,116 Gas Light and Coke Coy- ,, 3,300 2,750 10,048 9,477 Alexandra Palace Railway, New assessment 80 56 These valuations were confirmed by the Assessment Committee of the Union, and were accepted by the Companies, with 5 the exception of the Metropolitan Railway Co., who appealed to the Assessment Sessions, where a reduction was made, by consent, to £24,500 gross and £22,000 rateable value, the Company paying costs. Some 400 appeals were made to the Union Assessment Committee against the smaller assessments, but the large majority of these were dismissed, and the valuations sustained. The scale of assessment of weekly property became a question at the Union Assessment Committee, the Surveyor of Taxes having taken exception to the mode adoptedin some other Parishes in the Union as compared with that of Clerkenwell, which he appeared to approve. Thereupon the Committee asked for Returns from the various parishes as to the mode adopted by the Overseers (otherwise the Vestries,) in regard to this class of property ; which having been furnished, they considered the scale, which had been adopted and acted upon by this Vestry for some years past, to be so fair and correct, that they adopted itas the standard for the whole of the Union for the future, and revised the assessments of the other parishes accordingly. The final totals of the Valuation List of the Parish are £392,869 gross, and £327,604 rateable value. The gross and rateable values in the parish, were:— gross. rateable. In 1856 £244,527 £196,480 1869 291,793 235,657 1871 (Under New Valuation Act of 1869) 311 997 255,347 1876 Do. Do. 338,518 277,655 1881 Do. Do. 392,869 327,604 Thus showing that the gross annual rental value of the rateable property in the parish had increased by £47,266 from 1856 to 1869 (before the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, came into operation); and since 1869 to the present time by £101,076, or a total increase from 1856 (the year in which the Vestry was first established) to the present time of no less a sum thau £148,342, notwithstanding the very large amount of property removed in the course of the formation of the new street, called " Clerkenwell Road." In addition to the above, three Provisional Valuation Lists havebeenmade out and revised, comprising about 130 assessments. Assessed Rates Act, 1889 (Operation of).— In 6 January, 1879, the Vestry Clerk called the attention of the Vestry to the operation of Clause 4 of the Assessed Rates Act, 1869, which the Vestry had adopted shortly after the passing of the Act, by which the owners were compelled to pay the rates for property of a rateable value of not exceeding £20, upon receiving an allowance of 30 per cent, upon the amount of such rates; and he pointed out that in Clerkenwell, where large blocks of model dwellings are erected, lor which the rents are paid in advance, and on which the losses from non-payment of rent, and empties, are almost nil, a readjustment might well be made very favourable to the general body of ratepayers. The matter was referred to the Assessment Committee, and the result was that the resolution of the Vestry adopting the compulsory Clause 4 was rescinded, and the optional Clause 3 adopted in its stead. Under this Clause 25 per cent, is now allowed to the general body of owners of small tenements, on their agreeing to pay "full or empty," and 20 per cent, is allowed to the owners of the model dwellings. As the operation of this amendment could not take effect until after Michaelmas, 1879, the effect has only been felt since March 1880, and it has resulted in a saving of some £400 per annum, £250 more being fairly obtained from the Companies, which they objected to at first, but ultimately agreed to, and £150 from the other owners of small properties. Tramway Scheme.— The only Scheme before the Vestry in the past year was the Islington and Holborn Tramways Scheme, which proposed to commence near the west-end of Theobalds Road, passing thence along Clerkenwell Road, and joining the system of the North Metropolitan Tramway Company at Old Street, also to join the North Metropolitan system at the Angel, and to run down St. John Street Road and St. John Street to near Charterhouse Street. After several interviews between Mr. Chamberlain, the Solicitor to the Bill and the Committee of Works, the promoters agreed to pay to the Vestry, before commencing their works, the sum of £10,000, £7,000 to be the agreed value at 12/- per yard 7 super, of the almost new paving to be taken to ; and the remaining £3,000 to be a contribution towards the expense of the proposed widening of the narrow part of St. John Street, provided such improvement be proceeded with by the Vestry within 5 years; and the Vestry then gave their consent to the scheme, but the Metropolitan Board of Works, some of the adjoining Parishes, and many of the large ratepayers of this Parish opposed it, and it was consequently withdrawn. Dusting, Slopping, &C.—The most important feature of the year in relation to the Vestry's work is the inauguration of the new system of doing the dusting, slopping, &c., of the Parish by the Vestry's own plant and staff. This work had heretofore been done by contract, except that the Vestry had for many years employed its own staff of sweepers for street cleansing, contracting for the removal of the sweepings at per load. The question of the desirability of undertaking the whole of the work, as a matter of efficiency if not of economy, had been mooted from time to time, but had as often been deferred owing to the insulated position of the Parish, and the consequent difficulty of obtaining the necessary outlet for the parochial refuse by rail or river. The question, however, received tangible shape by a resolution proposed by Mr. Brailey, on the 20th November, 1879, that information as to results be obtained from other Parishes who had adopted the system. In consequence of this information these operations "were commenced by a reference to the Committee of Works to endeavour to obtain suitable premises as a Wharf and Stabling, and to report on the details of the requirements. A portion of Phoenix Wharf, Commercial Road, Lambeth, was ultimately taken on lease from Mr. W. Stubbs for 29 years from the 25th of March, 1880, at a rental of £615 per annum, with a premium of £500, and stabling and sifting sheds were erected, but the work was not commenced until the last days of May, and was not in full operation until the middle of July, and it is therefore only to be expected that the cost in the first year should somewhat exceed an average year's expenses in 8 this department. Further and fuller details will be found on page 25. Colney Hatch Lane.—In June, 1880, in consequence of the distance of this outlying portion of the Parish, the Ve9try entered into an agreement with the Hornsey Local Board for the latter to repair, light, water, and cleanse the whole of Colney Hatch Lane, charging Clerkenwell the half of the cost, with 10 per cent, for supervision, wear and tear of tools, &c., the boundary line dividing the two parishes running down the centre of the roadway as far as that portion of Clerkenwell extends. At the same time the Vestry also assented to a road being made 40 feet wide on the Muswell Hill estate, new building operations being in contemplation in this portion of the parish. Renaming Streets.— John Street, Pentonville, has been lenamed Risinghill Street, and King Street has been renamed Cyrus Street, and the houses in each street have been renumbered. Plane Trees.— J. Noble, Esq., of Park Place, Henley-onThames, having in 1878 presented this Parish, among several others, with the sum of £100 for planting and maintaining plane trees in the roads of the Parish, the Vestry planted about 50 early in the year 1880, in the most suitable roads and places in the Parish, but many having died or been destroyed, twentyfour fresh plane trees were planted during the year to replace same. Surveyor.— On the 18th November Mr. G. J. Cox, Surveyor, resigned his appointment, and on the 16th December Mr. W. Iron was elected in his stead. Reduction in the Price of Gas.— On the 1st January, 1881, the Gas Light and Coke Co. reduced the price of Gas from 3s. 4d. to 3s. 2d. per 1,000 feet. Bill Posting in Urinals. —During the year 15 prosecutions and convictions took place lor sticking bills in the Urinal of the Parish, and the sum of £14 10s. was paid in rewards to informants. 9 Metropolis Water Supply—This subject engaged the attention of the Vestry, and Messrs. Leaver and Brighty were appointed delegates to a conference of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, held at the Vestry Hall of St Martin'sin-the-fields, this Vestry contributing £10 towards the expenses connected with the matter. Summary Jurisdiction Act.— The question was raised by the Middlesex Magistrates as to their powers to hear rate summonses under this Act, and a friendly action to compel them to do so was successfully prosecuted by the Vestry of Islington, towards the cost of which this Vestry contributed £3 12s. 6d. Proposed NewStreet from Grays Inn Road to the Angel.— On the 25th of June, 1880, this Vestry with the Vestry of Islington and the Holborn District Board of Works, attended as a Deputation upon the Metropolitan Board of Works, and presented Memorial, urging the desirability of the formation of a new street from Gray's Inn Road at the corner of Clerkenwell Road to the Angel, but in consequence of the magnitude of the schemes already in hand, the Metropolitan Board of Works were unable to take steps in the matter at present. Charges to Companies for repair of Roads.— Being of opinion that the charges made to the Gas and Water Companies did not properly recoup the cost of the repair of the road and footways after trench work, the Vestry considerably raised the charges for same, which took effect from Christmas, 1880. Vacant land at junction of Cyrus Street and Percival Street.—The Vestry Clerk in March last called the attention of the Board to the dirty and unsightly piece of vacant ground at the junction of Percival Street and Cyrus Street next Goswell Road, as to whether the Vestry would be disposed to accept same and throw it into the roadway, should the Marquis Northampton be willing to give up for the purpose; and the matter was referred to the Committee of Works for consideration and report. Accident to Sewerman.—Joseph Barry, one of the sewermen in the employ of the Vestry, was scalded to death in 10 the sewer in St. John Street on the 6th July, in consequence of hot water being let into the sewer from Messrs. Nicholson's Distillery. An inquest was held, and it appeared that the hot water was turned into the sewer at certain fixed and well-known periods, and that the man himself indiscreetly incurred a risk by entering and remaining in the sewer at the time. A verdict was given of accidental death, and acquitting the Engineer of Messrs. Nicholson and Co. of any blame in the matter. Meetings. —The following is the number of meetings of the Vestry, and the various Committees held during the year:— Board 37 Committee of Works, including Sub-committees 86 Sanitary Committee 11 Assessment ,, 27 Finance ,, 15 Parliamentary,, 2 Special „ 5 ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell. July, 1881. SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM. Tramway Schemes.— With reference to two of the Tramway Schemes brought before the Vestry in November, 1879, it will also be necessary to say a few words, the consideration of the subject having extendi d into the present year. Two separate projects were introduced to lay Tramways down St. John Street Road and St. John Street to Charterhouse Street, one called the North East Metropolitan Tramways Scheme, and the other being an extension of the system of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company. Upon the promoters of the former scheme agreeing to pay for the paving proposed to be taken to, and also undertaking not to lay down any line through the narrow portion of St. John Street until same be widened, and also obtaining powers to contribute towards such widening, the Vestry gave their consent to the Scheme. In the case of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, consent was deferred for the arrangement of terms, more particularly in reference to their proposed siding in Goswell Road, opposite Compton Street, and eventually a cheque for £1,200 was obtained by the Clerk (although no legal claim existed), nominally in return for the concession of a portion of the footway necessary to make such piding, but in reality as satisfaction for the paving in Goswell Road used by the Company n 1872 without payment (payment for such not having then become customary), and in consequence of which a certain feeling of dissatisfaction existed against the. Company. They also agreed to pay 12s. per yard super for the paving which they would now take to, and the Clerk then informed the Company that the Vestry, having obtained satisfactory terms, would withdraw their opposition. When, however, this was reported 10b to the Vestry on the 18th March, 1880, a resolution was carried, "That this Vestry accepts the £1,200 offered by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company in respect of the Goswell Road Tramway; but having already signified its approval of the projected line of the North East Metropolitan Tramway Company along St. John Street and St. John Street Road, does not think it advisable to give its consent to any other line through those thoroughfares." In consequence of this resolution, the North Metropolitan Tramways Company considered that they were not fairly treated in the matter, and stopped payment of the cheque for £1,200. On the 15th April, 1880, the above resolution was rescinded, and on the 22nd a resolution was carried as follows :—"That, subject to the North Metropolitan Tramways Company agreeing to insert in their Bill a clause similar to that inserted in the Bill of the North East Metropolitan Tramways Company with reference to the widening of St. John Street from Albemarle Street northward, and also subject to their agreeing to insert a clause granting running powers to the North East Metropolitan Tramways Company over the proposed line down St. John Street Road and St. John Street, and on payment of the cheque for £1,200 fer the siding in Goswell Road, assent be given to their Scheme by the Vestry.'' The Company, however, would not accept the condition of granting running powers to another Company, and consequently the Bill was withdrawn, as was also the North East Metropolitan Tramway Scheme, in consequence of opposition from some other districts through which it proposed to pass,the promoters failing to fulfil the promises made by them as to terms for paving, &c., upon which they sought the consent of the local authorities. The whole of the proceedings in this matter have been printed in a separate form by order of the Vestry. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT.

As a year has now elapsed since the Vestry undertook the work of doing its own dusting, slopping, &c., we beg to submit a brief report upon the matter since the commencement of the undertaking to the 25th March, 1881. On the 20th November, 1879, a resolution was passed at the Yestry that information should be obtained from the Parishes who do their own work as to the practicability and economy of the system. On the 24th December the replies were laid before the Committee of Works, and on the 14th January, 1880, a Sub-Committee was appointed to make enquiries as to the practicability of obtaining a Wharf and Stabling sufficient for the requirements of the Vestry. The Committee having reported on the eligibility of a Wharf on the Regent's Canal in Macclesfield Street, the Board, on the 5th February, 1880, resolved that they would in future do their own work, and it was referred to the Committee of Works to consider as to the details of the work ; and on the 23rd February the tender of Messrs. Hayes & Son for eight Vans at £49 10s. each, and of Messrs. Bayley & Co. for four Carts at £30 each was accepted. 26 In the meantime information reached the Committee that a portion of Dowson's Wharf in the Commercial Road was vacant, and negociations were opened with the view to its acquirement by the Vestry, but eventually the owners declined to accept the Vestry as tenants, in consequence of the possible offensive nature of the deposits which would be made. On the 3rd March Mr. Stubb's "Wharf was first introduced to the notice of the Committee, and on the 8th March it was agreed that a portion of this Wharf should be taken at a premium of £500 and a rental of £550. Tenders for certain alterations were immediately advertised for, and on the 18th March Mr. Sharman's tender at £435 for finishing the stables, &c. was accepted. On the 15th April an additional 30 feet of the Wharf was agreed to be taken at a farther rent of £65. On the 22nd April five horses were purchased of Mr. Russell for £375, and on the 27th four more of Mr. Pain for £296 and four of Mr. Paris for £295. About this time a difficulty arose with Mr. Stubbs, it being discovered that he had reserved on the agreement plan a piece of land on the Vestry's portion of the Wharf near the jetty, but it was ultimately agreed that the Vestry should have a right of way over such piece of land, and that Mr. Stubbs should only deposit there temporarily while loading or unloading barges. On the 13th May Mr. Sharman's tender to erect a Sifting Shed, Furnace, &c., for £553 10s. was accepted. On the 15th two more carts were ordered of Messrs. E. H. Bayley & Co. On the 19th May the new regime was formally commenced by a procession of the Horses, Carts and Vans throughout the principal thoroughfares of the Parish, but, in consequence of the illness of the new horses, the work was not entirely out of the hands of the Contractors, who had been temporarily engaged on day work, until the 10th July. On the 30th June an intimation was received from the Solicitors to the General Ice Company, the adjoining occupiers, of a nuisance arising from the Wharf. The Vestry did all in its power to prevent any cause of complaint, but on the 21st 27 September an injunction was sought to be obtained by the Company restraining the “Vestry and Mr. Stubbs from carrying on their work on the ground that it was injurious to health. They were, however, unsuccessful, and on the 25th November they abandoned the action. On the 7th October another horse was bought at a farm-sale at Enfield for 52 guineas. On the 21st October a Code of Eegulations as to the payment by Costermongers and Tradesmen for removal of refuse was adopted. On the 16th December another horse was purchased of Mr. Paris for £75. On the 23rd December two more Vans were ordered of Messrs. Hayes & Son at £52 each. On the 12th January, 1881, two more carts were ordered of Messrs. Hayes & Son at £25 each; but these were not delivered and brought into use until close upon the expiration of the year. They are, therefore, not included in the expenditure of the first year. On the 3rd February, 1881, a horse, which had been used by the Vestry on trial for some time, was bought of Mr. Paris for £45. When the Surveyor, Mr. Cox, resigned in November, 1880, Mr. W. P. Griffith, of 16, Guildford Street, Russell Square, was appointed to measure up the works at the Wharf executed by Mr. Sharman, and having done so, he reported on the 13th January that £15 10s. 1d. was due to Mr. Sharman, while Mr. Sharman claimed £151 8s. 3d. The matter was by consent referred to an arbitrator, each party to bear a moiety of the cost, and Mr. Porter was appointed to that position. In consequence of the illness of the Surveyor acting for Mr. Sharman no further action has yet been taken in the matter. Owing to the constant complaints of Mr. Stubbs blocking the piece of land above referred to, the Board, on the 17th February, 18 81, passed a resolution authorising the Chairman of the 28 mittee of Works to proceed against Mr. Stubbs in the matter at any time be may think necessary. The attention of the Vestry having been drawn by the General Ice Company to an apparent percolation of water from the slop-shoot to their boiler room, a damp-course was laid by Messrs. Mowlem & Co. for the purpose of remedying this defect in future. The subject of establishing telephonic communication between the Vestry Hall and the Wharf was considered, but abandoned on account of inutility and cost. The foregoing statement embraces the leading features of the inauguration of the work of dusting and slopping by the Vestry's own staff. The actual amount of work done will be shown by the following figures. The first loads were removed by the Vestry's staff on the 31st May, but, as before stated, the whole of the dusting and slopping work was not undertaken till the 10th July, and, since the 4th October, the other cartage required has been done by the Vestry's carts. Since the 31st May, 5,870 loads of dust and 2,410 of street sweepings have been removed. 5,837 chaldrons of ashes have been delivered to purchasers in 85 barges. 60 freights of street sweepings and 14 of hard core have been removed from the Wharf. It is, of course, only to be expected that the first year's trial would not be altogether satisfactory, but the great number of dust complaints at the last part of the year was attributable entirely to the great snow storm of the 18th January last, which engaged the entire out-door staff for a fortnight in clearing the thoroughfares, and this loss of time was only regained by the employment of extra strength hired from Contractors. The entire cost of buildings, plant, and preliminary expenses incurred during the year amounted to about £4,660, divided as follows: — 29 BUILDINGS, PLANT, AND PEELIMINARY EXPENSES. Towards which £4,000 has been borrowed at 4 per cent., repayable over a period of five years. Dividing these charges as follows :— Buildings, premium, and legal charges, £2,526, over whole term of 29 years £87 per annum Remainder, £2,136, over 10 years £214 ,, Gives a depreciation of £301 per annum. 28 mittee of Works to proceed against Mr. Stubbs in the matter at any time he may think necessary.

It is hoped and confidently expected that at the end of the second year a much more favourable balance sheet will be able to be presented. It will be noticed in the above that a sum of £1,740 was paid to Contractors for work done while the buildings were being finished and the plant acquired. The item for Veterinary Surgeons will be considerably reduced now that the horses are purchased, and the Committee expenses will also show a large reduction now that the establishment is in working order.

October, 1881, REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOE 1880. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwel during the year 1880, was 1313. The annual average of the last ten years was 1400, so that the deaths were 87 less than the average. The deaths in 1879 having been 1456, those in 1880 were 143 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying Table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last 10 years; the births in each year being placed opposite :– 36  DEATHS. BIRTHS. 1871 1417 2274 1872 1323 2353 1873 1513 2664 1874 1417 2565 1875 1539 2505 1876 1342 2559 1877 1385 2522 1878 1303 2590 1879 1456 2667 1880 1313 2430 The births were thus 237 less than in the preceding year, and 82 less than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus :— According to the Registrar-Greneral s sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus :— DEATHS.

St. James 350 665 315 Amwell 331 621 290 Pentonville 298 493 195 Groswell 334 651 317 In each year a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in General an:l Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums, situated in other parishes. The estimated number of these for 1880 is 98. The number of births having been 2430, and of deaths 1313, the excess or the natural increase of population, is 1117. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1880 was 245 ; being 14 more than in the preceding year. The number and causes of deaths taking place from these principal zymotic diseases during the last 10 years, are exhibited in the subjoined table 37  SMALL POX. MEASLES. SCARLET FEVER. HOOPING COUGH.

The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age was 425 ; 13 more than in the preceding year. 227 deaths occurred at and above 60 ; being 24 less than in the preceding year. 107 Inquest-deaths were registered in the year; being 21 less than in the preceding year. 38 8 deaths took place in the House of Correction ; 3 in the House of Detention. 38 deaths arose from violence ; the number for 1879 being 43. Hence the mortality of the year has been below the average. The mortality amounted to 1 per 1000 ; if the persons dying in Hospitals &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 20 per 1000. In 20 large English towns, the mortality per 1,000 in 1880 was:—London, 22.2; Brighton, 19.6; Portsmouth, 18.7; Norwich, 23.7 ; Plymouth, 24.6 ; Bristol, 20.1 ; Wolverhampton, 21.1 ; Birmingham, 20.8; Leicester, 23.1 ; Nottingham, 25.1 ; Liverpool, 27.3 ; Manchester, 25.4 ; Salford, 25.8 ; Oldham, 23.3 ; Bradford, 21.9 ; Leeds, 21 ; Sheffield, 21.1 ; Hull, 23.7 ; Sunderland, 24.6 ; Newcastle-on-Tyne, 22. The mortality in all London was 22.2 ; that of the West districts, 19.9 ; of the North districts, 21.2 ; of the Central districts, 23.2 ; of the East districts, 24.3 ; and of the South districts, 22.8. The mortality has thus been considerably below the average ; exactly the same as it was in 1856. But the recent census has shown us that the population has augmented to 69,019. It may be interesting to note that in 1801, it was 23,396; in 1831, 47,634; in 1841, 56,799; in 1851, 64,778; in 1861, 65,681; in 1871, 65,380; and in 1881, 69,019. The number of deaths from zymotic diseases has been somewhat more than last year, but less than the average. The increase will be seen at once by reference to the table to arise from Hooping Cough, over which sanitary proceedings have perhaps the least control. At present there are no hooping cough 39 pitals, and if there were, most of the subjects are too young to be removed to them; and parents take no care to avoid infection, so that the little sufferers have to “ take their chance." Small Pox prevailed to some extent in the year, 42 cases having come to our knowledge ; about half of these were removed by the Union authorities. 6 of the deaths included under Scarlet Fever, were returned as arising from Diphtheria. Of the 14 deaths referred to Typhus, none arose from Typhus proper, 11 from Typhoid, and 3 from simple continued fever . Slaughter-Houses.—These were inspected in November. They were 7 in the upper wards ; and 9 in the lower. The defects in paving, lime-whiting of the walls, and the dirty cattlepens were ordered, and were seen to be remedied. Cow-Houses.—These were also inspected in November. They were 14 in the upper wards and 7 in the lower. The number of cows kept was 287. The cows were in fine condition. Bake-Houses.—These were not inspected during the year. Mortuary.—'The Mortuary-keeper's return shows that 304 bodies were received at the Mortuary during the year. 7 of these came from the Workhouse ; 94 were removed from dwellings for inquest purposes; and 203 were received from houses of the parishioners. The numbers last year were :—94, 96 and 129. As the Workhouse does not now receive paupers, the small number sent is accounted for. It is satisfactory to find that the parishioners appreciate and make use of the sanitary advantages offered by the Mortuary, iu a greater degree than heretofore. 40 The Meteorology of the year was as follows :— 1880. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 109 years. Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation =100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 65 years.

At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18th December, 1873. "The Clerk called attention to the fact that since "the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor Rate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of "the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had "been revived for the purpose in November, 1871, "there was no Poor-rate Account published, except "the remainder of those in collection by the Vestry "previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both "Boards, to publish the Poor Rate Account of the "Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Reports of the Vestry, in which case there would be "one and a half years' Poor Rate Account to be "appended to the Report about to be issued for the "year ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved and "adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. The Poor Rate Account of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor for the year ending Lady-day, 1881, is annexed hereto accordingly.
