Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1953. The District is divided into three Wards: Bedfont. Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4,925. The Home population (mid year) as estimated by the Registrar General is 47,090. This is an increase compared with the 1952 figure of 46,560. The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops, but a large number of residents work outside the district, particularly in London. Only a very small number continue to work in agriculture. The sum represented by a penny rate is £1,436 3s. 3d.

When it is considered that in those twenty-four years the population has increased from just under 14,000 to over 47,000 the improvement which has taken place is even more remarkable. It is to be hoped that the position will be maintained and in fact improved upon by a continued reduction in the number of new cases of tuberculosis. The mass X-ray Unit of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board visited a local factory during the year when 367 persons were examined. Maternal Mortality Two maternal deaths occurred during the year. These are the first such deaths since 1950. 7 Housing There are still many families sharing accommodation or living in one or two rooms. They are mostly young couples, often living with their parents, and in many cases trying to raise a young family under most difficult and trying conditions. There is still a need for more houses although in the post-war years the Housing Committee have built 1,390 permanent houses and 150 temporary bungalows. This is a magnificent achievement which will bear comparison with that of any other authority of similar size. Quality has not been sacrificed to the need for numbers, and the Committee is to be congratulated upon the fine houses which have been provided, both for their pleasing appearance and layout and the amenities afforded. In addition. 397 privately built houses have been completed. Diphtheria Immunisation Facilities for immunisation against diphtheria are provided by the Middlesex County Council at their clinics or through the local medical practitioners. The Department has co-operated with the Area Medical Officer of the County with regard to the publicity campaigns which have been undertaken. Water Analysis 1. The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District are supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co., and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South West Suburban Water Co. is taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is derived from the River Thames purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines and Walton, and is filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. A contact period of over an hour is given at the works for the completion of chlorination. The water supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. 2. Samples for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis are taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least five times each week. Weekly samples have been taken by the South West Suburban Water Co. In addition five samples were taken by my department. Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board 8 Supply.

No action has been required in respect of contamination of the water. All water is chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use. 5. With the exception of a very few outlying cottages, all the houses in the area are supplied from the public water mains. Only a very limited number of houses are supplied by standpipes common to two or more houses, the vast majority being supplied direct. Population supplied with water from standpipes is approximately 25. Food Poisoning Eight unrelated cases of food poisoning have been notified during the year. Investigations, which in some instances were hampered by delayed notification, were made in each case, but the causes were not ascertained. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355-357 of the Middlesex County Council Act. 1944. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to thank the members of the Committee for the support which they have given me during the year and also Mr. Bell and the staff of the department for their able and willing assistance. F. H. WOODS. Medical Officer of Health. 10 CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure In the post war era the first demolition order was made in 1946. This was followed by eight more in 1948 and in 1950 a definite programme was commenced, thirty houses a year being allocated for the rehousing of persons displaced from unfit houses. In accordance with this programme, 109 houses have been dealt with during the years 1946 to 1953 (inclusive) as follows:— Demolition Orders made 98 Agreements entered into with owners to " close " or repair 9 Houses demolished 58 Houses demolished as a result of informal action 2 Persons who have been or will be displaced 318 Action taken during 1953 is as follows:— Housing Act, 1936 No. of Houses No. of Persons displaced Houses represented to Public Health Committee 34 — Demolition orders made 34 — Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 11 26 91 Houses closed in pursuance of an undertaking given by the owners under Section 11, and still in force 1 1 Parts of buildings closed (Section 12) — — Housing Act, 1949 Closing Orders made under Section 3 (1) — — Demolition orders determined and closing Orders substituted under Section 3 (2) — — 11 Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 Closing Orders made under Section 10(1) — Housing—Repairs Action to secure the execution of repairs continued as necessary and is summarised below. The "reasonable cost" provision of the Housing Act, 1936, limited the effective repair, by notice, of the older houses let at low rents. Informal Action No. of Houses No. of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local authority under the Public Health or Housing Acts 211 Action under Statutory Powers Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:— No. of Houses (a) by owners 2 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 Housing Act, 1936 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Sections 9, 10, 11 and 16):— (a) by owners 6 (b) by local authority in default of owners 0 The survey of all the pre 1918 houses authorised by the Public Health Committee in 1952 was almost completed at the end of the year, and it is hoped that during 1954 a comprehensive plan of action both with regard to demolitions and repairs will be formulated. 12 Overcrowding The Council's building programme has considerably alleviated the overcrowding which existed a few years ago, but there still remain many houses shared by two families, the second family often married sons or daughters. The conditions under which some of these families are living are unsatisfactory and not conducive to their health and well being. In a minority of cases statutory overcrowding exists. Moveable Dwellings Public health control of moveable dwellings in the area is effected by means of Section 345 of the Middlesex County Council Act as amended by the 1950 Act and by byelaws. The consent of the Council is required to the stationing and use of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. During the year seven applications for consent were received, four were refused and limited consents given in the other three cases. An application was received from an industrial occupier of land for consent to use two caravans on the land and a limited consent was given in this case. Very little trouble was experienced with the wandering gypsy. Much of the land previously camped upon by these people has now either been built upon or enclosed and is no longer available to them. Shops All shops are regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. Arising out of these inspections one certificate of exemption from the provision on the premises of sanitary accommodation was granted. Satisfactory alternative arrangements were made. Licences for the keeping of pet shops were granted in two instances. Three shops were licensed to deal in game. The " late day " for the general closing hours of shops in the area is Friday, but shopkeepers remain free to fix 13 their own half day closing subject to the provision of the Shops Act. Food Premises All types of food premises were inspected regularly and as frequently as possible, special attention being given to catering establishments, premises registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, bakehouses and other places where food is actually prepared. Regular periodic inspection has now been carried out with few breaks for approximately two years and there have been very definite improvements in the standards of many of the premises. There is still need for considerable further improvement and at the end of the year special efforts were being made with regard to the protection of foodstuffs exposed for sale in food shops. In most cases the occupiers of shops co-operated and were anxious to achieve a higher standard but in one case legal proceedings had to be instituted in respect of a greengrocer's shop for nine offences in all under Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, Section 57 of the Shops Act,1950 and the Byelaws with regard to the handling, wrapping and delivery of food. Legal proceedings were also instituted under Section 3 of the Food and Drugs Act. 1938. against a firm of bakers in respect of foreign material found in a loaf of bread. Catering establishments including factory canteens and school kitchens 91 Fruit canning factory 1 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 60 Greengrocers' shops 30 Butchers' shops 23 Bakers' shops 15 Milk shops 5 Fishmongers' shops 13 Sweet and confectionery shops 44 Food Preparing Premises Four premises were registered under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act. 1938 as premises where food was to be preserved. In each case it was a groceries and provisions shop and was registered for the purpose of cooking bacon. 14 At the end of the year there were 29 premises which had been registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc 11 Premises used for the cooking of fish 9 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle, etc., who are not the occupiers of an open shop for the sale of foodstuffs require to be registered with the local authority and the foodstores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered. Attention is constantly given to traders in foodstuffs elsewhere than at shops with a view to enforcement of the above-mentioned Section and it is found that many of the businesses set up by these people are comparatively shortlived so that new hawkers of foodstuffs are constantly being registered and at the same time previously registered hawkers discontinue their businesses. During the year five hawkers of foodstuffs were registered and a further application for registration was refused. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from a fixed site in any public street are required to hold a licence under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944 and issued by the local authority. During the year two such licences were granted.

Foodstuffs which are not suitable for such disposal are buried at the Council's refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1938—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the district. During the year the results of the 1951 census of population were published and showed the population of the area to be over 40,000. This would have entitled the local authority to become the Food and Drugs Authority for its district but the County Council made application to the Minister of Health for an extension of the direction already made in respect of other authorities in the County to be extended to cover Feltham and other districts which, as a result of the level of population, would have been entitled to become Food and Drugs Authorities. This application was opposed by the local authority but after consideration the Minister decided to grant the County Council's application. The Public Control Department of the County Council carry out the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 operated by the County Council and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of that Department for the following figures of samples taken in this district:— Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 197 32 Arrowroot 2 — Cakes 16 — Chops 1 — Coffee and Chicory Essence 1 — Cooked Meat 7 — Cornflour 2 — Cream 2 — Drugs 3 — Evaporated Milk 1 — Fish (various) 9 — Fish Paste 1 — Flour, Self Raising 1 — Flour, White 2 — 18 Jelly 4 — Lamb 1 — Lemon Curd 1 — Meat Paste 3 — Meat Pie 1 — Minced Meat 9 — Mincemeat 1 — Non-brewed Condiment 6 2 Olive Oil 1 — Peanut Butter 1 — Salad Cream 1 — Sausage and Sausage Meat 21 — Suet 2 — Tomato Ketchup 1 — Victoria Plums (Canned) 3 — Vinegar 9 — White Pepper 1 — Wines and Spirits 12 — Totals 323 34 Action was taken upon the unsatisfactory samples but prosecutions were not necessitated. The Public Control Department licensed one dealer/processor of pasteurised milk and during the year 11 inspections were made of the premises and 52 samples of milk procured. 181 premises were visited in connection with the Department's duties under the Merchandise Marks Acts. 1887—1927 and 69 premises in connection with the Labelling of Food Order. 1953. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk) and (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 The number of licences granted to sell graded milks is as follows :— Tuberculin Tested 9 Accredited — Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 21 Supplementary Licences :— Tuberculin Tested 12 Accredited — Pasteurised 12 Sterilised 11 19 102 Samples of graded milks were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. One sample only was unsatisfactory. Two new milk distributors were registered during the year. There are two registered dairies in the area. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continue to receive attention. There were no manufacturers of ice cream in the area. 62 Samples were procured and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. Only two failed to be graded provisional group I, these were placed in group III. The position is very much improved on that of a year or two ago. Seven premises were registered, under Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act. 1938, for the sale of ice cream. Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was continued. The annual test baiting of the Council's sewers showed that one sewer was slightly infested and this was treated. The Council's refuse tip was kept under observation and any sign of rat activity dealt with immediately. During the fifteen months ended on the 31st March. 1954, the complaints received of infestations numbered 185, and these together with cases discovered by members of the staff involved the inspection of 1,099 premises. Rat infestations were found at 141 premises and mice infestations at 60 premises. Of these 160 treatments were undertaken by the department, the remaining 41 being carried out by the occupiers. When treatments are carried out by this department on behalf of the occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings is made in the case of private dwellings, and the full cost of the treatment in the case of business premises. Where the occupiers elect to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision is given to ensure that the treatment is effective. 20 Arrangements were made with the Middlesex County Council for this department to carry out any rodent control works necessary on the portions of the Duke of Northumberland's River and the River Crane in this area. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 There are two premises registered under this Act, where filling materials are used. Disinfestation Four premises were found to be infested with bed bugs and were disinfested: Council houses infested 4 Other houses infested — The method of disinfestation normally employed was spraying with contact insecticides incorporating D.D.T., and this work was carried out by the department. The furniture, etc., of prospective Council house tenants is inspected before removal to the Council's houses and if necessary is treated for tha eradication of bugs. Disinfestation for the eradication of the following vermin was carried out at the numbers of premises stated :— Mites 1. cockroaches 5. fleas 3. woodworm 2. In addition 7 wasps' nests were destroyed. Infectious Diseases—Disinfection The following numbers of premises have been disinfected after cases (or suspected cases) of infectious disease :— Tuberculosis 24 Scarlet Fever 35 Poliomyelitis 6 Diphtheria 3 Cerebro Spinal Fever 1 Cancer 2 Total 71 Administration of the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948 Part 1 of the Act 21 1.
