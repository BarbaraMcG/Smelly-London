PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TOWN HALL, SPA ROAD, S.E. Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Twelfth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year 1912. The report deals with the 52 weeks beginning December 31st, 1911, and ending December 28th, 1912. The death-rate was 16.9, compared with 18.4 in 1911, and 17.6 in 1910. This is the lowest death-rate recorded since the formation of the Borough, but is still the third highest rate in the Metropolitan area. No serious outbreaks of infectious disease occurred during the year, but the mild type of scarlet fever mentioned in the last three reports was more prevalent. There was a large decrease in diarrhœal diseases, a decrease in diphtheria, and a considerable increase in measles. The sections of the report are, as usual, divided into : — I.—Vital Statistics. II.—Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.—Sanitary Administration. IV.—Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. Again, I may record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordiality and co-operation throughout the year. Thanks are also due to the members of the staff for their hearty co-operation in carrying out the various duties devolving on the Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. KING BROWN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The populations of the Borough of BerMondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1901 and 1911, and the estimate for the year under report, are as follows:— 9 1901. Estimated to June 30th, 1912. 1911. Bermondsey Rotherhithe St. Olave 82,483 82,119 82,073 38,460 34,747 35,142 9,817 8,699 8,568 Borough 130,760 125,960 125,388 As the Census is taken in April, it is usual to calculate the various rates on the mean population, which is assumed to be that existing at the end of June or the middle of the year under report. To arrive at this it is therefore necessary to estimate for a further three months, which in Bermondsey is assumed to be a decrease. The decrease is partly due to the increased facilities of transit, leading to a tendency on the part of the population of this, as well as other central boroughs, to seek residence further out. This is an object to be desired, since it is beneficial alike to those going and those remaining, for only in this way can sufficient space be provided round houses and overcrowding on large areas be avoided. If the demand for slum property ceased it would soon lead to its abolition. Another cause of decrease is the replacement of small house property by factories and warehouses as soon as the leases fail in. This cause is slow but steady and will gradually displace the population towards the periphery of the metropolis. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended December 28th, 1912, was 3,799, consisting of 1,913 males and 1,886 females. This is 311 below the average for the last 10 years, and 43 below the figure for 1911. This total includes 2,502 for Bermondsey, being 26 below that for 1911, and below the average for the last 10 years ; 1,065 for Rotherhithe, being 2 below the number for 1911 and 35 below the average for the last 10 years ; and 232 for St. Olave, being 15 below the number for 1911, and 41 below the average for the last 10 years. In Table II. of the appendix will be seen the figures for the last 10 years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth-rate, for 1912 was 30.3 per thousand persons living, which is 0.2 below that for 1911 and 1.7 below the average for the last 10 years. Particulars of rates will be found in annexed Table A. London is included for comparison. A new departure with regard to births was made by the Registrar-General in 1906. The births are corrected by distributing those which occurred in the chief lying-in hospitals of the Metropolis to the Boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission. Those allocated to Bermondsey in 1912 number 49, and if they are added to the above total the rate would be 30.7 Table A —Birth-rates. Year. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave. Whole Borough.

Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1912 was 1,182, being 52 above the number for 1911, and 64 above the average for the last 10 years. In Table VIII. of the Appendix will be found particulars of numbers and rates in the three Registration Sub-districts. The numbers have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. Deaths. In Table IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. The extended table of causes of death initiated m 1904 will also be found in the Appendix.* The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the 52 weeks ended December 28th, 1912, was 1,601, which is 181 less than in 1911, and 357 less than the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of non-parishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2,119. This is 201 less than in 1911, and 319 less than the average for the last 10 years. The annexed table shows the distribution of deaths in quarters, together with the corresponding quarters of 1911. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year. * This has had to be considerably altered and extended so as to embody the recommendations of the International Commission as published in the Manual of the International List of Causes of Death, the second decennial revision of which was issued in 1912.

If the Census population be taken as the basis of calculation of the rate, it works out at 16.8, which is 0.9 below that for 1911. Table C.—Death-Rates. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. Year. St. Olave.

Bronchitis, measles and cancer are chiefly accountable for the increase, whereas the principal cause of the decrease is the diminished number of deaths from diarrhoea and pneumonia. In column 1, foot of Table I. of the Appendix, will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the district. There were 20 such deaths in all, against 22 in 1911, and 30 in 1910. 3 such deaths occurred in the infirmary; 10 in River Thames and Docks; 5 on the Railway; and 2 in the street. 538 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 560 in 1911, and 542 in 1910. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred will be found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix.

"The age and sex distribution of the population of England and Wales being taken as a standard to all communities within their borders, the death-rates of different localities can be calculated on the assumption that they have the same proportions of children under 5, old people, and women as have the population of England and Wales. By thus eliminating this disturbing factor of age and sex distribution different communities can be brought into strict comparison with one another. "In 1883 the Registrar-General commenced a method of correcting the death-rates of the great towns of England and Wales. Taking account of the differences of age and sex distribution between these and the latter, he has calculated a factor for each great town by which the recorded death-rate must be multiplied so as to allow for the differences of age and sex, and thus places them as regards these matters on an equal footing. You thus get death-rates the difference in which we can put down to general sanitary conditions alone. In illustration of this I have taken the above figures from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for 1912 to form Table E. "It will be seen from this that in London and the Boroughs the correction raises the death-rate, showing that there is in them a preponderance of people living at ages when the death-rate is low (viz., between 5 and 50), and also of women, sufficient to keep the recorded death-rate down, notwithstanding the great number of children under 5."

The reduction in the infantile mortality for 1912 is almost entirely due to the small amount of summer diarrhoea, and this m turn is accounted for by the unusually wet and cold summer, in fact it can scarcely be said that we had any summer at all, with the exception of a couple of weeks at the latter end of July. Heat is very pleasant for those who have nothing to do and can keep themselves cool, but it is one Oi the greatest enemies that infants have to contend with. Table G. Whooping Cough.

This gives a zymotic death-rate of 1.21. The total number of deaths from notifiable diseases, viz., scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus fever, and enteric fever, was 31, compared with 27 in 1911, and for the non-notifiable, viz., measles, whooping cough, and diarrhoea, 221, compared with 325 in the previous year. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths over 65 years of age in 1912 was 516, compared with 467 in 1911. Death Certification. There were no uncertified deaths in 1912. Small-pox. There were no deaths from this cause in 1912. Measles. There were 101 deaths due to this disease, which is 3 below the average for the last ten years, and 50 above the number for 1911. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows, viz. :—l4, 49, 25, 13. Diarrhœa. Table H shows the connection between the meteorological conditions and deaths from this disease. The most important factor in the prevention of diarrhoea is undoubtedly breast-feeding. If young children are breast-fed and given reasonable care, their chances of life are four or five times, and according to some authorities ten times, as great as children artificially fed, even when this is done under favourable conditions.

The deaths occurred in quarters as follows : —9, 17, 5, 5. Typhus Fever. One death occurred from this disease. The history of this case is given under Notification of the disease. Enteric Fever. 5 deaths were due to this cause, 3 in Bermondsey, 1 in Rotherhithe, and 1 in St. Olave. The corresponding figures for 1911 were 6 for the Borough, viz, 4 in Bermondsey, 1 in Rotherhithe, and 1 in St. Olave. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular disease in 1912 was 299, against 305 in 1911. This figure comprises 195 for Bermondsey, 80 for Rotherhithe, and 24 for St. Olave. Of these, 212 were due to phthisis and 87 to the other tubercrdar diseases. 1.27 56.2 69.4 0.58 6 0.23 60.48 67.06 18 Phthisis.

The figures for London show a slow but steady fall. It is probable that specially wet or cold winters, by killing off a number of chronic cases, may account for the fluctuations. Further account of the work done in connection with tuberculosis will be found under notification of the disease. Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver. 20 deaths were attributed to this cause in 1912, against 21 in 1911. This number gives a very small idea of the deaths caused by these diseases, since they are often the remote causes of death and are not always mentioned on the certificate for various reasons. Cancer. 155 deaths were attributed to this cause. The Cancer Research Commission have not yet ssued their final report on the subject. Heart Diseases. 174 deaths were due to this cause, which number is 8 above that for the previous year. This refers to organic or valvular disease of the heart. Suicides. 15 persons committed suicide in 1912, viz., 4 by poison, 2 by asphyxia, 3 by hanging, 1 by drowning, 4 by cutting or piercing instruments, and 1 by jumping from high place. Accidents. 96 deaths were due to accidents, against 89 in the previous year. Particulars will be found in the extended table of the Causes of Death in the Appendix. Other Violent Causes. There was 1 death by homicide during the year under report. DIPHTHERIA. Notifications, 1912. marked Red. Average 10 years, 1902-1911, marked Green. IL—NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In Table 111. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified exclusive of notification of phthisis which numbered 779 was 896, compared with 943* in 1911, and 746 in 1910. The disease which shows a decrease on the number for the previous year is diphtheria (49), while those showing an increase are scarlet fever (106), puerperal fever (6), cerebro-spinal meningitis (2), ophthalmia neonatorum (6), typhus fever (1), enteric fever (5), membranous croup (1), acute poliomyelitis or acute polio-encephalitis (5). The number of cases notified in the registration sub-districts was 598 in Bermondsey against 655 in 1911, 238 in Rotherhithe against 242, and 60 in St. Olave against 46 in 1911. The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 7.1, the rate for the sub-districts being 7.3 for Bermondsey, 6-9 for Rotherhithe, and 7.0 for St. Olave. The corresponding rates in the previous year were 7.5 for the Borough, 8.0 for Bermondsey, 6.9 for Rotherhithe, and 5.3 for St. Olave. 32 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, but if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of cases. Small-pox. No cases were notified during the year under report. Typhus Fever. One case of typhus fever was notified during the year under report. This case was seen by me on October 3rd in company with the medical attendant. The rash was fairly typical of typhus and the man seemed very ill and subsequently died. His mental condition, however, was clear and there was a total absence of the usual concomitants of the disease, viz., poverty, dirt and overcrowding, etc. The man was a lighterman earning good wages and had a very good home. As no other case occurred in the house it is difficult to be absolutely certain whether the case was a genuine one, but arguing by the process of exclusion it was impossible to come to any other diagnosis. Diphtheria. There were 211 cases of diphtheria notified in 1912, of which 137 occurred in Bermondsey, 65 in Rotherhithe, and 9 in St. Olave. This is a decrease on 1911, for which the figures were :— Borough, 260 ; Bermondsey, 184 ; Rotherhithe, 60 ; and St. Olave, 16. From the following table it will be seen that a slight decrease has taken place throughout London. Cases of Diphtheria Notified. Year. London.

The case mortality was 8.1 per cent., against 5.0 per cent, in 1911 and 8.7 per cent, in 1910. 10 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. 223 specimens were sent in by medical practitioners for bacteriological examination, against 176 in 1911 and 122 in 1910. Of these 49 were found to contain diphtheria bacilli, all of which were notified. In 14 cases of diphtheria the source of infection was attributed to previous cases in the house or family. The following appeared in the report last year and gives an explanation of the method adopted in this Borough to prevent the spread of this disease. Diphtheria is a disease caused by a characteristic bacillus known as the Klebs-Loeffter Bacillus, which occurs in the throats of persons attacked by the disease. It seems to be conveyed from person to person by direct contact, and there is no virulent disease which will spread more rapidly under certain circumstances than this will among school children. It is more or less directly conveyed * This number included 142 cases of chicken-pox. from throat to throat by children passing sweets, slate pencils, and other articles which they are liable to put in their mouths, from one child to another. Kissing an affected person on the mouth will also frequently give rise to the disease, and an infected child coughing in the neighbourhood of non-infected ones will also often transmit the disease to them. Sometimes the bacilli will exist in the throat for a long time without producing any symptoms, but such children, while not suffering themselves, will be liable to convey the infection to others. For this reason they have been called " carrier " cases, and, as expressed in previous reports, my belief is that a large part of the spread of the disease is due to such cases. Since 1902 an endeavour has been made in this Borough to prevent any of these " carrier " cases returning to school, and each Annual Report has contained some account of the working of the plan. This consists in getting the parents of a child which is notified as suffering from diphtheria to bring up the other members of the family within a week or so after the removal or recovery of the case to the municipal laboratory at the Town Hall for examination. If diphtheria bacilli are found in the throats they are excluded from school for a fortnight, and if then found to be free, are allowed to return to school. The number of children thus examined in 1912 was 356, belonging to 157 families. Out of this number 2 had diphtheria bacilli in their throats or noses, and both developed the clinical symptoms of diphtheria, and were therefore notified. Scarlet Fever. The numbers for scarlet fever have been low for many years, but it is showing a tendency to increase again. The form of the disease is very mild and it is possible that this is one of the causes of the increase. Many cases seem to have no rash or if one occurs it is so slight that it is liable to be missed. This I have no doubt tends to facilitate its spread. There were 411 cases notified —265 for Bermondsey, 118 for Rotherhithe, and 28 for St. Olave. This is an increase of 106 for the Borough on the total for 1911. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table 111. of Appendix, was fairly uniform. 19 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scarlet fever. The accompanying chart shows the prevalence of the disease in each of the 52 weeks under report. The average notifications for the past ten years are shown in green. There were 8 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 1.9 per cent., against 2.o per cent, in 1911. The disease, as in recent years, was of a mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 3-3, against 2-4 in 1911. In 43 cases the source of infection was attributed as follow : — Previous cases in house or family or neighbouring houses ... 29 School infection 11 "Return" cases 3 In the 3 cases classified as "return" cases the source of infection was some other member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attack of scarlet fever within a fortnight previous to the second case occurring. In this case the source of infection in the second case is presumed to be the child recently returned from hospital. The following statement on the subject is reprinted from my Annual Report for 1907 : —" A good deal of attention has been given to these so-called ' return ' cases on the part of the laity, and also by medical authorities, the former generally being inclined to attribute it to premature discharge from the infectious disease hospital. As stated, however, in previous reports, facts do not support this view, because in the first place the cases are very few compared with the number discharged, and in the second case it is sometimes those children who are detained months over the usual time and that cannot be considered to have been prematurely discharged who produce the disease. "The micro-organism which produces scarlet fever has yet to be discovered, and the probability is that when this is made it will be found it behaves in a somewhat similar manner to diphtheria, and will be found to exist in the noses and throats of the patients who either have not got the disease at all, or who have recovered from an attack some considerable time previously. Those patients who have suffered from complications leading to pathological discharges from nose, throat and ears are more liable to spread the disease than simple, uncomplicated cases." Measles. The number of deaths for 1912 was 101, against 51 in 1911, 143 in 1910 and 196 in 1909. The annexed table gives the number of notifications received from schools, the number of " contacts " excluded. In the first quarter there were 14 deaths, in the second 49, in the third 25, and in the fourth 13. This disease is subject to considerable fluctuations, and as practically every child gets it it depends largely on the number of foci in a district which start the infection. As remarked in my previous report, there is no doubt that the infants' departments of the schools are very largely responsible for the spread of this disease, though the London County Council's regulations, of which the following is a copy, are strictly carried out: — (1) Senior Departments— (a) If a child has had measles it need not be excluded from attendance at school. (b) If a child has not had measles it should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. (2) Infants' Departments— All children should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. Enteric Fever. 34 cases of enteric fever were notified, being 23 for Bermondsey, 6 for Rotherhithe, and 5 for St. Olave. 3 cases were returned as not suffering, making an actual total of 31. The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 29. SCARLET FEVER. Average 10 years, 1902-1911, marked Green. Notifications, 1912. marked Red. ENTERIC FEVER. Notifications, 1912. marked Red. Average 10 years, 1902-1911, marked Green. There were two small outbreaks of enteric fever which illustrate very well the way it spreads from person to person and also the mischief which a single case not properly diagnosed may cause. Some of them occurred in the end of 1911 and stretched on into the beginning of 1912. No. of case. Date of beginning of illness. Initials. Age. Sex. Remarks. 1 M.C.

Brother of No. 2 7 P.H.C. 10 years M 5th January, 1912 All these cases apparently arose from No. 1 which was not isolated in any way as the disease was supposed to be rheumatic fever ; however, no doubt it was a case of undiagnosed enteric. Cases 3, 4 and 5 were also probably enteric. A small outbreak occurred in a family in Weston-place but they could all be traced to two cases on August 4th, the origin of which could not be traced. These were followed by cases on 27th August and 11th and 31st September. The outbreak stopped at these. With these exceptions the cases of enteric fever which have occurred during the year were what is known as sporadic or isolated cases. The same applies to the outbreaks above mentioned. It is frequently impossible to trace the source of infection. In 10 cases the source of infection was attributed to previous cases. Puerperal Fever. 19 case of puerperal fever were notified. There were 4 deaths. Membranous Croup. 3 patients were notified as suffering from membranous croup. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. There were 42 cases of this disease notified during the year. Under this heading is included every kind of " sore eyes " occurring in the newly born. They were all visited by the Health Visitors, who instructed them to immediately seek medical advice. Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Three cases of this disease were notified. Most of the cases diagnosed under this heading in London are cases of meningitis occurring in children and have been long known as " post-basic meningitis "or " Still's disease." They have always been with us, but as they are caused by a micro-organism which resembles that causing the disease known as cerebro-spinal fever, which occurs in outbreaks, it was thought advisible by the London County Council to include them under the term " cerebro-spinal fever." Dr. T. Houston, of Belfast, who has had an opportunity of investigating a large outbreak which occurred there in 1911 and 1912, is of opinion that the micro-organisms of the two diseases, although belonging to the same group, are fundamentally different and give rise to different diseases, and with this view, on present evidence, I am inclined to agree. The cases notified in Bermondsey gave rise to no other cases, but disinfection and isolation were carried out. 14 Sanatorium Patients. Age. Date of leaving Sanatorium. Time in Sanatorium.

This must be considered a very satisfactory result considering that we were not able to get hold of the best cases from a sanatorium point of view. The majority of suitable cases were unwilling to leave their work as they had no method of supporting their families, but I am hoping under the Insurance Act, which came into force on the 15th July in the year under report, it will be possible to get cases away in the very early period when it is possible to completely cure many of them. The greatest difficulty one has to deal with is the after care of consumptives, and until there is some organisation whereby suitable work can be found for patients on leaving the sanatorium a great deal of the money spent on this treatment will be wasted. Consultations. I was called in by a medical practitioner to assist in the diagnosis of a doubtful case of infectious disease. 9 patients were also examined at the request of school teachers, school nurses, parents, etc. I examined at the Town Hall 36 phthisis patients.

Infants Milk Depots. I was requested by the Public Health Committee to make a report on the advisibility of having a milk depot, and for "this purpose I visited in London the Lambeth and Battersea Municipal Depots and in Leicester the Municipal Dried Milk Depot. The following reports were given to the Committee. The matter was referred to the new Council and adjourned sini die. " When the question of the prevention of infantile mortality first became prominent some ten or twelve years ago, one of the remedies which received a great deal of attention was the provision of sterilized or pasteurized cow's milk through the medium of infant milk depots. Discretion, however, was not always used in choosing recipients for the milk, and a tendency to indiscriminate distribution took place, the result being that the depots fell into disrepute with municipal bodies on account of their expense, with the milk trade on account of the competition, and with the medical profession because it was felt that they were encouraging the discontinuance of breast-feeding, to the detriment of the infantile population. Similar, however, is the history of almost every new remedy which has found a permanent place in our pharmacopoeia. When first discovered enthusiasts make extravagant claims, then they fall into disrepute, are rejected by everyone, and when they have lain dormant for a while someone discovers that there is some good to be obtained from the remedies, and they finally find suitable places in our armamentarium. The same may be said of milk depots, which, now that the early extravagant claims have been given up, have now come to their proper position, and the next consideration is : What is that position ? There is no question whatever that the best food for infants is their mother's milk, and any advice or system which tends to depreciate the value of it in the mother's eyes cannot be too strongly deprecated, but we live in an artificial age, and even if every mother desired to adopt and continue breast feeding, there will always remain a certain percentage who cannot commence, or, having started, cannot continue breast feeding. The causes of this are various, and are attributable sometimes to the mother and sometimes to the infant. The mother may be poor and badly nourished, in which case the breast milk wall suffer ; she may be delicate or actually ill, or, if healthy, may lose her milk from some unknown cause. On the other hand, she may start breast feeding, but for economic reasons find it necessary to go to work at the end of the first three or four weeks of her infant's life. Sometimes her infant is too weak to suck or has some congenital defect of the mouth, or the milk may disagree with the infant, or the child may be too ill. All the possible causes are not stated here, but the commonest have been mentioned. Now, if the baby for any reason cannot be breastfed, the question comes to be what form of artificial food is the best, and this generally resolves itself into what form of milk is best. Among the upper classes there is as a general rule little difficulty, for with the help of their medical adviser a cow's milk suitably modified can easily be obtained, but it costs money and it will be found that all forms of commercial modified milk are much dearer than ordinary commercial milk. With the working classes in Bermondsey, however, the matter is quite different. A cow's milk, really reliable, and safe for infants, cannot be obtained here at prices within the reach of the poorest class, the result being that they fly to the cheapest forms of skimmed milk, either fresh or tinned, which means starvation for their infants. Such milk is often supplemented with all sorts of bits and scraps from the parents' food, or else some form of biscuit. It is against this sort of thing that the Health Visitors have been fighting for the last two years, but only too often, on telling the mother the injury she is doing to her infant by giving skimmed milk, we get the reply that she cannot afford anything else. We are constantly meeting cases of this sort in our mothers' class, and have many a time been at our wits' end to get food for the infants. In a few of the extreme cases the guardians have supplied milk for a short time, but this is not modified in any way to suit the infant, and when given out at their offices there is not always a guarantee that the whole of it is used for the infant. A class of case we meet with often is where the child is in delicate health, though not ill enough to be attended by a doctor, and all it requires is a better milk suitably modified to meet its case; but we can do nothing except recommend the mother, if she can afford it, to get some milk and dilute it with water or barley-water. Guy's" Hospital has recently started a special out-patient department for infants, and not infrequently we get requests from the physician to try and get milk for some special case where this is the only admissible diet and the parents seem too poor to supply it. The general practitioners in the Borough would also welcome a depot where they could send infants under their care who require a good modified milk. I often receive inquiries for them where such a thing can be got. I think I have given enough detail to show that there is plenty of work for a depot in Bermondsey, and if certain conditions were laid down under which milk will be supplied, I think there is little danger of the depot being abused. Such conditions would be (1) that the mother cannot breast feed, (2) that she must bring the infant to the depot at stated intervals for weighing and examination, and submit to a certain amount of supervision at the home. A good plan is to sell milk only to those who come with a recommendation from a medical man. To ascertain the present position of milk depôts in London, I visited the municipal depots of Battersea and Lambeth. In both of these good milk is got from farms which are under strict sanitary supervision. It is then modified to resemble the composition of human milk, boiled, sterilized or pasteurized, and sold to poor mothers at a cheap rate for the purpose of feeding their infants ; or if the mothers are nursing, then they can have good milk for themselves. The usual price for infants under six months old is Is. 6d. per week, and for those over that age 2s. and 2s. 6d. per week. In neither case does the sale of the milk cover the cost of the depot, the deficit being, in round numbers, £500 and £300 per annum respectively. In Battersea the average number of infants at present receiving is 150 and in Lambeth about 90. The cost of apparatus, etc., for starting the depot in Battersea was £167 14s. lid. and in Lambeth about £200. In each place an ordinary dwellinghouse was taken, and altered to suit the purpose of a milk depot. Besides accommodation for waitingroom, apparatus, &c., two or three rooms are occupied as a dwelling-house by the manageress. In dispensing milk for infants one feed of modified milk is placed in each bottle, so that the mother has nothing to do but to place the bottle in a bowl of warm water, remove the stopper and replace it by a rubber teat which is supplied at cost price. The number of feeds given daily varies from 9 for young infants to 6 for older ones. The mother must call daily for the milk, and on Saturdays get a double supply. The staff required consists of a manageress and a couple of assistants, and a man to spend about half a day attending to the boiler, &c., during the time of sterilizing and washing the bottles. As to the benefits derived from the depots, the Medical Officers of Health for Battersea and Lambeth are absolutely convinced of their utility, for in spite of the fact that the large majority of infants coming to the depot are actually ill or below par, the infantile mortality among them varies from one-third to one-half of the mortality among a similar population in the Borough not using the milk. As, however, many persons are suspicious and often justifiably so about statistics, I will quote a paragraph from the latest report of the Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth, Dr. Priestly. " The most conclusive proof of he value of a milk depot, in so far as the children fed are concerned, is to be found in the medical histories of individual cases, which show again and again that infants who appear to be seriously ill and wasting, if not moribund, as a result of improper or irregular feeding, at the time of commencing the milk, actually recover and become strong and healthy children. " The educational value, too, of a milk depot must not be lost sight of." To start a depot on a small scale the apparatus will cost about £150, and the alteration to a house to carry on the work £200 or £300, and the net cost to the Borough about £300 per annum. Since preparing this report I have heard that there is a municipal milk depot in Leicester in which dried modified milk is supplied, and that its operations have been most successful, not only in preserving infant life but as regards expense, for it is said to be carried on without any financial loss whatever. I hope next week to have an opportunity of visiting it and shall make a further report at an early date." Injant Milk Depot. (Dried Milk.) " As intimated in my previous report, I have made local inquiries in Leicester as to their experience of the use of dried milk in their infant milk depot, and find the results, both medically and financially, entirely satisfactory. The County Borough of Leicester has a population of 227,000 inhabitants, a large proportion of which consists of the working classes. Owing to the difficulty of getting suitable milk for infants a depot on the lines of those in Battersea and Lambeth was started in July, 1906. As, however, it soon became evident that it was a great expense, and in addition only served the position of the inhabitants in its immediate neighbourhood, chiefly owing to the inconvenience of sending for the milk every day, the medical officer began to experiment cautiously with dried milk in the latter end of 1907. During the following two and a half years liquid and dried cow's milk were both used, the latter in ever-increasing amount, until about two years ago the use of the liquid milk was finally abandoned. In the first year of dried milk alone the net cost of the depot was £43, and in the second year the receipts were in excess of the payments £41 3s. 7d. ; but since it is not the intention of the borough to make money out of the depot, the surplus will be probably used to reduce the price of milk to some of the most needy of the clientele. Here is what Dr. Killick Millard says on their first experiment in his Annual Report for 1910 :— "At first only infants were put on to this who were not thriving, or who were unable to retain the humanised milk. The results in most cases were so encouraging that its use was gradually extended. Mothers began to ask that their babies might be changed on to the dried milk, and it was practically unknown for a mother whose baby had once been placed on dried milk to ask to go back to the humanised. The medical men in the town also began to appreciate the virtues of dried milk, and quite a number of infants were sent by medical men with a request that they should be placed on it. " At first, and for a considerable time, it was thought desirable to advance cautiously, lest it should be found that the prolonged use of the dried milk might be accompanied by certain dangers, such as the development of infantile scurvy, supposed to be caused by the use of sterilised milk. Careful watch was kept for any untoward symptoms, and inquiries were made as to the subsequent health of infants several months after they had discontinued having the milk. An inquiry was also addressed to the medical men to ascertain if they had any reason to suspect injurious effects. The inquiry was very reassuring, for no bad results could be discovered as a set-off against the obvious immediate good results. Indeed, I may say that we have quite come to believe, with certain eminent authorities, that the fear of infantile scurvy or rickets from the use of dried milk is a bogie which need no longer alarm us." In his Annual Report for 1911, and up to the present date, the experience of the medical officer amply confirms the statement I have quoted above. In 1907 the average number of infants receiving the weekly supplies of milk was 102, and from that date till now its popularity has steadily increased till now nearly 400 are using the milk. When at the depot I saw many infants at present being fed on dried milk, and also saw some who had been fed on it some years before, and all seemed to be thriving. The depôt consists of an ordinary small shop in a poor part of the town. This is fitted up with shelves and a couple of large zinc-lined receptacles where the dried milk is stored. From these it is weighed and put into pound tins and a suitable label is affixed explaining the method of using the milk. Three sorts of milk are supplied by the wholesale dealers, viz. : (1) " Full milk," i.e., with all its fat, (2) three-quarter milk, and (3) half milk, each with three-quarters and half of its original fat respectively ; a certain amount of sugar is also mixed with it. Each mother is supplied with a small ladle, and so many fills of this are added to a certain quantity of hot water. If the infant is under three months it gets half milk, from three to six months three-quarter milk, and from six months upwards full milk. The milk is very digestible and as it is mixed fresh for each meal it is impossible for it to go bad during keeping in the home. This dried milk will keep wholesome an indefinite time, and herein lies an inestimable advantage, for one of the most fruitful causes of infantile diarrhoea is the decomposition of ordinary milk, which inevitably takes place a few hours after its arrival in the home especially during the summer months. In the process of drying the milk is sterilized, and is therefore incapable of transmitting bovine tuberculosis or other infectious diseases. In a letter to the “ British Medical Journal," in January, 1910, Dr. Killick Millard sums up the advantages of dried milk as food for infants as follows : — 1. Ease of digestion.—Milk not " sicked up," as is often the case -with fresh milk, however modified. 2. Bacterial purity. —Freedom from tubercle baccilli or contamination by flies. 3. Conservability.—No “ souring ” in hot weather. 4. Cheapness.—No waste. 5. Convenience. —Always ready for use, no waiting for the milkman. 6. Palatableness.—Babies love it. In Sheffield, where dried milk has been in use also, the Medical Officer, Dr. Scurfield, states : “ We have more than two hundred babies constantly on the dried milk. Our experience is that dried milk is much more easily digested than raw or boiled cow's milk, and that no ill consequences, such as scurvv or rickets, follow its use. It is, of course, only an inferior substitute for mother's milk.” And, lastly, Dr. Robert Hutchison, Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, and a well-known authority on dietetics, states in his book on “Food and the Principles of Dietetics ” : “ The powder (i.e., dried milk) so prepared contains all the solids of the original milk in a sterile and soluble form, and is therefore of the highest nutritive value. There can be doubt that desiccated milk will come into large use in the immediate future.” The cost of starting a depôt for dried milk is trifling compared with an ordinary one. There is no sterilizing or bottle washing apparatus required, and the only staff necessary is a manageress to give out the milk. The mothers buy one or two pound tins at a time, and this is suitably labelled and she returns when it is done. In Leicester they have only a part-time health visitor, so that the supervision of those taking the milk is not so good as it would be with us. Accurate registers are kept of all babies getting the milk, and accounts are kept in accordance with business principles and audited every year by the Borough Treasurer. The rule is with very few exceptions that all milk is paid for by someone. If the mother cannot afford it help is received from the Charity Organisation Society, guardians, or some philanthropic persons, and this system is found to work very well. lam convinced that if a similar depot were started here in a small way that it would very soon pay its way, and give the Health Visitors an immense hold over the rearing of infants who from any cause cannot have their mother's milk.” Cowsheds. There were 3 cowsheds in the Borough. These received regular visits, the total number of inspections for 1912 being 18. One notice was served. Unsound Food and Foreign Meat Regulations.

Ashdown. Unsound Food and Foreign Meat Regulations. " In reviewing the operations under the above in this district during the year 1912 I find that the quantities of goods received are in some cases smaller than in the previous year, but the decrease was probably not due to slackness in trade but to labour trouble. During the strike here, work at the water-side was at a standstill, and considerable trade drifted to other ports. In the past, want of uniformity of inspection has been blamed for the diversion of certain lines of goods, but complaints of that kind have not been so numerous during the period under report. At the present, comment is made rather frequently that Continental fruit, etc., arriving on “ through rates " by the Southern Counti Railways, reaches the London Market without inspection. Pig Carcases. None have been landed in the district during the year. Bacon. Principally Siberian or Russian, the number of bales was about 73,000, and is below the number for last year, I think, entirely through the labour trouble, otherwise there would have been a considerable increase. The quality continues to improve especially compared with the early consignments of pig carcases. Beef. Queensland frozen beef in quarters. The quantity received, unexamined, in this district has been smaller than in recent years, and of that received considerable quantities were intended for export so that it went unexamined into cold store pending re-shipment. In those examined a much smaller number, than formerly, was found infested with the beef worm (Onchocerciasis). More care has evidently been exercised by exporters. Beef Tongues. (Commented upon in last year's survey.) The regulations with regard to these and the method of inspection had not been altered at the end of the year under report. More stringent measures are evidently necessary. The principal portion of those brought to this district in ships now go into barge direct and are landed in the City. Beef Offal. With one exception, that passing through wharves in this district had been cleared at the Docks. Butter Milk Blended. The Regulations have only been applied to one parcel of 502 boxes at half cwt. each, during the year. These were injured by a fire in the ship's hold and were stopped on landing as being unfit for human food. Canned Meats. One new line of beef from Madagascar caused considerable trouble during the early portion of the year, upwards of 13 tons from different consignments were seized after which a representative of the firm visited this country and here upon the matter, apparently with good results. Eggs. Have again received considerable attention, and although a large number of unsound undoubtedly still reach the consumer, great improvement has taken place. In dealing with unsound parcels at the Wharves we have followed the practice of the past few years and insisted that when sorting and re-packing is necessary from our point of view, the same be done in this district, to which there is now seldom an objection raised. The result of this action, is to some extent shown by the item of about 81 tons mentioned in the table attached as destroyed. This is a larger amount destroyed out of a smaller quantity landed. Soft Fruit and Vegetables. Considerable quantities of these goods have as usual been landed, but the proportion seized or stopped has been small. Continued improvement in packing and transit no doubt account for this. For the seoond year no German plums have been seized. In presenting this Summary I desire to put on record the ready and valuable assistance rendered me in the execution of the duties under these regulations by the Customs Officers attached to the various stations within my district.” Food Inspectors.

Food and Drugs. In Tables XIII. and XIV. of Appendix will be found a list of the samples taken in 1912, and the action taken ; 1,175 samples were taken, compared with 1,214 in 1911 and 1,172 in 1910. Of these 8.1 per cent, were found adulterated, compared with 11.4 per cent, in the previous year and 9.6 per cent, in 1910. The most notable feature of the analysis of samples of this and recent years is the number of adulterations of milk which show the addition of small percentages of water, ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 per cent. This is due to the present standard which requires 3 per cent, of fat and 8.5 per cent, of non-fatty solids. Magistrates and others are liable to forget that this so-called " standard " represents the lowest limit below which milk must not go. The vast majority of natural milks show considerably higher figures, and the result is that the samples are watered down so as to be as near as possible this " standard " and the small percentages show that they occasionally overstep the mark. Sixteen per cent, is the amount of water allowed in butter, and it is astonishing how closely manufacturers keep to this amount, but occasionally they also overstep the mark, but even this small percentage beyond the legal limit is very beneficial to the trader if undetected, since he can make a very large profit out of 1 per cent. In the accompanying table will be seen the percentages of milk fat in the various samples of milk. Milk Fat. Under 3 per cent. Year.

There were 139 premises where ice cream is manufactured on the Register at the end of 1911, 19 were removed during the year under report, making a total of 120. 117 inspections were made and 11 notices served. Hairdressers and Barbers. At the end of 1912 eleven barbers were in possession of certificates. Inspections. In Table XII. of Appendix will be found particulars of the general sanitary work by the District Inspectors during 1912, and in Table IX. the number of premises on the Registers to which special attention has been paid. The house-to-house inspections number 4,220. This is 2,145 above the total for the previous year, and is an average of 528 per Inspector, against 259 in 1911. 4,592 intimation notices were served, compared with 3,403 and 1,160 statutories, against 909 previous year.

It was found that the method of measuring up all the sleeping accommodation of houses visited entailed a very large amount of work and did not yield advantages commensurate with the labour involved. It was therefore decided to stop all measuring except in special cases where overcrowding was suspected or where houses were about to be reported for Closing Orders under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, with the result that the Inspectors have been able to visit many more houses and there is a prospect of them getting over the district in a reasonable time.

On account of complaints received the following report was submitted to the Public Health Committee, (a) As a result several improvements were effected in the working of the destructor and the height of the chimneys considerably increased, since which there have been very few complaints from the school, though the inhabitants of the surrounding houses do not think there has been much, if any improvement. "An examination of the complaints from the Neckinger school enumerated in the letter of the London County Council, dated 27th June, 1912, and in the correspondence referred to in it, shows that they have their origin in three distinct sources, and as such I shall consider them separately. These are (1) the dust destructor, (2) the electric fight undertaking, and (3) Ellis' tannery. In my opinion there is ample justification for these complaints, but before coming to the question of the remedies I shall endeavour to estimate the amount and seriousness of the nuisances. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, certain matters can be dealt with as a " nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health," and although these alleged nuisances would all come under the designation of " nuisance," it is not so easy to bring them all under the designation of " injurious " or " dangerous to health." An unpleasant smell may be a nuisance, but if no special form of disease is conveyed, and the presence of a poisonous gas in sufficient quantities to be a presumptive cause ill health cannot be ascertained, a nuisance order in a court of law would be difficult to obtain, unless the effluvium complained of were concentrated or some evidence of actual injury to health could be produced. If, on the other hand, evidence of the presence of an injurious gas or gases in measurable quantities can be offered, the nuisance is much more serious and calls for immediate steps to be taken for its abatement. The fumes and smells from the dust destructor, ever since its inception, have caused more or less nuisance to the occupants of the surrounding houses, and with each extension of the electric light undertaking these have become worse. At first the chief nuisance was caused by the cooling of the clinker in the yard, and later by the emanation of smoke and other noxious fumes from the building itself. The first mentioned has been remedied to some extent, but the second is worse, and the causes are not far to seek. The primary object of a dust destructor is to get rid of the household refuse of the district as quickly and effectually as possible, and for this purpose it should be collected from the houses at frequent intervals, in a cleanly manner, brought to the destructor and tipped into the furnaces and completely burnt. There should be no accumulation of refuse about the tipping platform and no escape of noxious fumes anywhere except up the tall chimney. Owing however, to the endeavour to unite the functions of a dust destructor and a generating station for electricity in one undertaking the result is favourable neither to the quick and hygienic disposal of refuse, nor the economic generation of electricity. In order to get sufficient heat, trade refuse from other boroughs in London is accepted, mixed with our own refuse, allowed to accumulate on top of the hoppers, rushed through the furnaces, and raked out half consumed. The consequence is you have nuisance from the carting in of refuse in very large quantities by dust vans, which are ill packed and overloaded, and have to wait their turn for hours in the Neckinger ; accumulation of filth and garbage, &c., in the building, fermenting, giving off fumes and dust, attracting flies, and smelling from incomplete combustion when it emerges again from the furnaces. Complaints are received from time to time from the houses in the Neckinger, the Town Hall offices, and the Neckinger school, all of which can be traced to the above causes. The next complaint concerns the electric light undertaking. As additional electricity is demanded, it is necessary to put up new plant, but the dust destructor, no matter how loaded, cannot supply sufficient heat, and additional boilers have to be erected. As the tall chimney is now taking its full complement of furnaces it has been found necessary to erect three iron chimneys for the new boilers, and these I submit have put the climax on the nuisances caused since the erection of the destructor. These chimneys, though short, have a very large diameter, and the furnaces they relieve bum coal alone and are fed by a forced draught. The result is that though combustion is fairly complete and black smoke the exception, they emit enormous quantities of light coloured smoke containing a very high percentage of sulphur compounds. The chief of these is sulphur dioxide, a gas obtained by burning pure sulphur, and extremely irritating to the nose, throat and bronchi of persons breathing it. It is the gas we use for disinfection of rooms and in sufficient concentration is deadly to all forms of animal or vegetable life. Now, owing to the lowness of the new chimneys, this gas finds its way into all the buildings round the depot in turn according to the direction of the wind, but as the west and south-west winds are most prevalent the Neckinger school suffers most frequently. I have been in there on several occasions and find that the school rooms and passages, especially those situated on the side next to the depot, are frequently filled with these sulphurous fumes to the detriment of the teachers and scholars. As there are about 800 of the latter it is obvious that such a nuisance may have very serious and widespread consequences. As regards the third complaint, I do not think Ellis's tannery is the sole one that causes unpleasant odours. There are several tanneries in the neighbourhood, and it is very difficult to pick out one specially. As long as you have tanneries you will have smells, but a great deal can be done by enforcing general cleanliness. Unfortunately the tanning trade does not come under any bye-laws for offensive trades. Some of the sewers in the neighbourhood also occasionally cause offensive smells. The nuisances, however, from the tanneries and sewers in this part of the borough are, in my opinion, much less serious than that due to the dust destructor and the electric light chimneys. To remedy these nuisances I am of opinion that the dust destructor and electric light undertakings should be separated and the former moved down to its old place in Rotherhithe. The buildings are still there and the neighbourhood is much more suitable. Ido not believe that adding a few feet to the present iron chimneys will remedy the sulphur nuisance or touch the nuisances from the destructor. The smoke from large coal-fed furnaces should be discharged into the atmosphere at a height of 150 to 200 feet, otherwise it cannot be sufficiently diluted, and will be a source of danger to the immediate surroundings." . Overcrowding. The following cases of overcrowding were visited by the Medical Officer of Health during the year under report:— Occupants of overcrowded portion of house. Cubic feet space required. Rooms occupied and cubic space. Deficiency State of Premises and Family. cubic feet 323 Man, wife and girls 8 and 5 years. Living and sleeping, 1,200 Front room, first floor, 897 The husband is a dock labourer whose work is very uncertain at present .

The youngest child is now sleeping in another room in the house, but the room is still badly overcrowded. The rent is 6s. 6d. per week, and they Say if the father could get work they would take another room. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Several houses which had been closed in 1911 were finally demolished under Demolition Oideis in 1912, viz. : 1-20, Bell Court; 1-9, Medley Place. One house in Medley Place and two in Lamb Alley (Nos. 4 and 5) were demolished voluntarily. The notices which had been served in 1911 on Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Port Passage, under Section IS were complied with in 1912. No notices under Section 15 were served during 1912 The notices under Section 17 which were served on 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 70, 71, id, 74, 75 and 78, Snowsfields, have all been complied with at the time of writing (July), with the exception of those on 59 and 60 which houses the owner has decided to pull down. The following houses were rendered fit for human habitation and orders determining the Closing Orders were passed and the houses are inhabited again—Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, St. Marys Place ; and 74, 76, 78 and 80, St. Marychurch Street. The following are the improvements which were effected : — St. Mary's Place. Reconstruction of drainage in accordance with the London County Council bye-laws ; provision of windows to the second flight of staircases ; new dormer windows in the attic and a window in the back of the first floor room in those cases in which there was not one already. The brickwork of the back walls of Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 17, 18 and 19 has been rendered in cement, and the front walls of all the houses pointed. The houses have been cleansed and redecorated from ground floor to attic. St. Marychurch Street. The drainage and various appliances connected with it have been completely reconstructed and renewed respectively ; the external walls repointed and repaired, and the houses cleansed and redecorated throughout. In No. 74 the flank wall next to the vicarage, as well as the roof and most of the top storey, have been rebuilt. The staircase has been lighted, and the internal parts of the house repaired where required. ,v In Nos. 76, 78 and 80 the staircases have been lighted, No. 78 by a special wondow in the flank wall, and the internal parts, including the woodwork, repaired and painted. As a result of a representation Nos. 1-13, Turners Retreat were closed. The following is the report made to the Committee : — Nos. 1 to 13, Turner's Retreat. " The above thirteen houses have been inspected under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, and I am of opinion they should be closed under Section 17 as being unfit for human habitation for the following reasons. XXCL KIl UOl xvx o . i • • Full particulars of the insanitary condition rendering this action necessary are m my possession, but the following summary mil give a good idea of their condition : Nos. Ito 11 inclusive are similar in size and structure, and consist of two storeys, with one room on each floor and a basement intended to be used as a wash-house, but just as often used as a lumber room. The yards are small and the paving mostly defective, the surrounding walls dirty and. dilapidated. The w.c.s situated in the yards, are all more or less dirty and dilapidated and the drains defective. The walls of the houses are built of brick, are very old, more or less dilapidated, and many of them are bulging and dangerous. The cellars, which are intended to be used as wash-houses, are very foul smelling and dirty, and being open front and back form a harbour for stray cats and a receptacle for all sorts of filth. The walls and floors are damp and in one or two instances the walls fell in through dilapidation and have been repaired. They are difficult of access, the approach being down a narrow, rickety and dangerous staircase. X A ° 1 f j _ _ J il._ vktfvf- W/Sll The ground floor rooms are all more or less dirty and the staircases are unlit and not well ventilated, while the upper rooms are dirty and have no through ventilation. The woodwork throughout the whole of the houses is more or less old, dirty and dilapidated, and many of the rooms are verminous. The roofs are old, but do not appear to be leaking, except in one case. Nos. 12 and 13 are back-to-back houses, and consist of three storeys, with one room on the ground floor, two on the first floor, and an attic on the second floor. They have no basements. No. 12 is much the worse of the two. The rooms are all dirty and dilapidated. The woodwork, including the floors, is old, dirty, and dilapidated, and some of the rooms are "verminous. The ventilation generally is bad, but an attempt to improve this has been made by placing a skylight over the first landing of the stairs. This is at present leaking, and lias broken panes. The attic is one of the dirtiest and most dilapidated rooms of this kind I have come across. . aV/X VJDD . No. 13 is not quite so bad as the last, but is similar structurally. The tenants are very clean, and have succeeded under adverse circumstances in maintaining a superficial appearance of cleanliness, but the woodwork is very old and out of repair throughout. The front wall of this house is bulging, and has been tied near the junction of the two houses to prevent its falling. There are two w.c.s to these houses situated on the opposite side of the court, and owing to frequently broken locks and doors are generally accessible to and apparently used by the public. They are old, dirty and dilapidated, and the drains are defective." Closing Orders were also served on Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Walkers Place ; Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18, Upper Russell Street; and Nos. 4 and 5, Lamb Alley ; and the following is the report made to the Committee. The owner has a scheme under contemplation but is not sure yet whether he will pull them down. Nos. 1, 2 and 3, Walkers Place ; Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18, Upper Russell Street, AND Nos. 4 AND 5, LaMB ALLEY. " I beg to represent the above houses, under Section 17 (1) of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, as being in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. . . I have carefully inspected them, and beg to report that the following conditions apply to them all. The brickwork is old and in many places perished, especially at the backs of the houses. The whole of the woodwork without exception is old, dirty and dilapidated, and in many places very defective. The walk and ceilings of the rooms, passages and staircases are with one or two exceptions very dirty and out of repair, and the bedrooms of all the houses and the living rooms of many of them are in a very verminous condition. The staircases in most cases are dark, steep, winding and dangerous, and the treads are worn. The ground floors are more or less under the street level, and some rooms or portions of each house show very defective light and ventilation. The following defects will be found in subsidiary groups : — Walkers Place, Nos. 1, 2 and 3. —These have no back yards but the fronts abut on a small, much closed-in court. There are three w.c.s situated in a very narrow passage off this court. They all ventilate into one another and are all in a dirty and dilapidated condition, and two of them are so small that I am sure it is impossible to use them with the door closed. Upper Russell Street, Nos. 10 and 12.—Have no back yards but the back door of the scullery opens out into the court of Walkers Place. There is one w.c. situated in this court for these two houses, and it is small, badly lit and ventilated, dilapidated and in a somewhat exposed position. Nos. 14 and 16 have small back yards with one w.c. each. They are much closed in by high buildings. No. 18 has no back yard, but situated at the back of the ground floor rooms is a room now used as a scullery which seems as if it had been a yard at one time. There is a w.c. situated in it which ventilates into the ground floor room through this scullery. Lamb Alley, Nos. 4 and 5, are in an advanced stage of dilapidation. The house next to No. 4 has been pulled down and has left the flank walls exposed and dangerous. There are many other defects besides those mentioned, the details of which are in my possession."

Children put out to nurse —nil. The total number of births which took place in Bermondsey last year was 3,799, and of these 3,737 were notified under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. The difficulty referred to in the last report of getting the whole of the cases notified has to a large extent been overcome by the sending out to parents and doctors the special letters mentioned in my comments on this table for 1911. lam still of opinion that it would have been better had the time allowed for registration been shortened from six weeks to one, instead of having a special Act. An endeavour is now been made to hunt up delinquents, and a letter is being sent to the medical practitioners pointing out to them that it is their duty to inform the father of his duty under the Act, and that the medical man in attendance is not exempt unless he has reason to believe that someone else has notified. Of the 3,737 births notified, 2,860 received primary visits from the Health Visitors. The number of secondary visits was 585. Of this number 2784 were breast fed, so that, with very few exceptions, breast feeding among the working classes in Bermondsey is the rule. This, however, only continues for a period of a month, or six weeks at furthest, after which period working mothers here find it necessary to supplement the meagre income by work of some description. Their infants are then left in charge of a stranger or some inexperienced member of the family, the result being they are artificially fed, and the wonder is that the infantile mortality is not much greater. It speaks well for the vitality of the infantile population that they survive the extraordinary methods of feeding to which some of them are subjected. Any enquiries into the subject of breast feeding and the best methods of ensuring its continuance will be incomplete if the ceconomic conditions of the mothers is not taken into account. Voluntary Tuberculosis Dispensary. The report for 1912 of the Voluntary Tuberculosis Dispensary which was established in June, 1911, shows a great increase of work which necessitated the appointment of an additional doctor and nurse. They are also contemplating taking new premises. During the year there were 944 new patients examined. 721 or 76.4 per cent Bermondsey Rotherhithe 108 or 114 „ 75 or 8 „ St. Olave's South wark 19 or 2 „ 3 or 0.3 „ Camberwell Elsewhere 18 or 1.9 „ Total 944 Of these 324 or 34-3 per cent, showed definite signs of pulmonary tuberculosis and 121 or 12.8 per cent, were suspected but not definitely proved to be suffering fiom pulmonary tuberculosis, while 26 or 2.8 per cent, had other forms of tuberculosis than pulmonary and 473 or 50 per cent, had no symptons of tuberculosis. Included in the total number of 944 were 281 patients who had been living and associated with tubercular patients under the care of the dispensary and were what are known as " Contacts." Of these, 85 showed definite signs of pulmonary tuberculosis and 42 were suspected of early disease while 154 had no symptons of tuberculosis. This latter is part of the most useful work of the dispensary since these 127 cases probably would not have seen a doctor until the signs were very much more advanced in which case it is likely they would either have been incurable or very difficult to treat. The dispensary is carried out on the lines of what is known as the Edinburgh system and works with cordial co-operation with the Public Health Department and the various philanthrophic agencies. For these figures I am indebted to the Superintendent of the dispensary, Dr. Robert Govan, who has taken a great deal of interest in its working, and has rendered valuable assistance in looking out for patients for our sanatorium beds, diagnosing cases and in other ways in prevention of pulmonary and other forms of tuberculosis in Bermondsey.
