Gentlemen, I beg to present to you my Report on the health of the Borough of Hornsey for the year 1905. The birth-rate, which has been steadily falling for more than twenty years, is 18.38, a lower figure than ever before recorded. In 1894 the birth-rate was 33.6. The death-rate is again an extremely low one, and is, in fact, the lowest on record for Hornsey and, I imagine, for any large town. Even more gratifying is the very low Infantile mortality, viz., 67, as against 86 last year and an average yearly rate for the last 10 years of 99. Here again the rate is the lowest ever recorded. The number of cases of infectious disease notified is higher than in the previous year, but is well under the average yearly number for the last 10 years. The statistics relating to deaths from Cancer and Tuberculosis are set out in considerable detail in the report. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HAROLD COATES, M.D., D P.H., 3 BOROUGH OF HORNSEY. Summary of Statistics.

Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Part 3, adopted July, 1896. Population.—The estimate of the population of the Borough at the middle of 1905 is based upon the number of occupied houses as ascertained from the rate books, and upon the average number of persons per house as shown by the last census returns. Calculated in this way, the estimated population of Hornsey at the middle of 1905 was 85,213 persons. The estimated population in 1904 was 84,227 persons, so that in the twelve months it is estimated that the population of the Borough has increased by 986 persons. During this period the number of births in the Borough has been 1,567, and the number of deaths 696, or an excess of births over deaths of 871. 4 The increase of population has, therefore, been largely a natural increase, and comparatively little is due to excess of immigration over emigration as regards this district. The increase of population is this year much smaller than in previous years. The following table shows the estimated population for each Ward in 1904 and 1905, with the increase or decrease which has taken place in the interval:— Ward. Estimated population, 1904. Estimated population, 1905. Variation during the year, 30th June, 1904, to 30th June, 1905. Increase. Decrease.

There were about 160 fewer occupied houses at the middle of 1905 than at the corresponding period of 1904. Towards the end of the year, however, many of these houses were again becoming occupied. The rate of growth in the West Hornsey Ward is maintained at about the same level as in the previous year, and it now appears to be the most populous ward in the Borough. In Finsbury Park, North and South Haringey, and East Hornsey Wards there is no room for expansion by the erection of new houses, and, if the population increases at all, it can only be by an increase of the number of inhabitants per house. Probably in some parts such a change is going on. Density of Population.—The density of the population is, for 1905, equal to 29.6 persons per acre, as compared with 29.4 persons per acre in 1904. 5 The following table shows the density of population for each Ward:— Ward. Area in acres. Population. Number of persons per acre. Highgate 709.5 12,101 17 Muswell Hill 663.5 10,613 16 Crouch End 376 5,362 14 West Hornsey 227.5 12,131 53 East Hornsey 195.5 12,125 62 North Haringey 125 10,186 81 South Haringey 109 5,938 51 Stroud Green 269 9,518 35 Finsbury Park 199 7,239 36 2,874 85,213 29.6 The following table shows the Ward populations at the census, the estimated population 1905, and the increase in 4¼ years:— Ward.

In the combined West and East Hornsey Ward (what was in 1901 the Hornsey Ward), the increase of population during the same period is equal to 30 per cent. of the original population. In Highgate the increase has been nearly 16 per cent., and in Crouch End 11 per cent., and in the other Wards the increase has been trifling. Births.—The number of births recorded during 1905 was 1,567. This is a decrease in the number of births, as compared with 1904, of 92. Ten of the births occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse. The birth-rate for the year was 18.38, and that for 1904 was 19.69, a considerable fall in a birth-rate, already very low. Of the 1,567 recorded births 25 were illegitimate. The number of births and the birth-rate for each quarter of the year is as follows:— 1905. HORNSEY. ENGLAND AND WALES. No. of Births. Birth-rate.

East Hornsey and North Haringey show a fairly high birth-rate, but in the remaining wards, noticeably in Stroud Green, the rate is extremely low. There were 25 illegitimate births, forming 1.5 per cent. of the total births, a very small percentage. Eight of the 25 illegitimate births occurred in the Edmonton Workhouse, but, when these are allocated to the wards in which the mothers lived before entering the Workhouse, we get the following distribution:— 8 Ward.

The death-rate, calculated on the number of deaths registered in the district (607), may be termed the General or Crude deathrate, and this rate for the year 1905 is equal to 7.12 deaths per thousand of the mean population for the year. This is an extremely low death-rate, and is, in fact, the lowest ever recorded in Hornsey. The next lowest have been 7.51 in 1903, and 7.81 in 1904. Now, although this General death-rate does not indicate the true mortality of the Borough, and cannot be used without correction for comparing the mortality of Hornsey with other districts, it is a trustworthy basis of comparison (and for special reasons it is in Hornsey the best) between the mortality of 1905 and that of previous years in Hornsey. As shown in the table (page 15), the General death-rate for 1905 is a very favourable one, the average death-rate for the preceeding 23 years being 10.09. In order to arrive at a true bill of mortality, we must exclude from our registered deaths those of persons who have happened to die in our district, but who belong to other districts, e.g., patients who have been admitted into our Isolation Hospital from outside districts and who have died; these number 3. There are 9 other persons belonging to outside districts who have died in other places in Hornsey. Altogether there are 12 deaths to be deducted as not oelonging to Hornsey. On the other side there are to be added the deaths of Hornsey people which have taken place outside the Borough. The death-rate so corrected is called the Recorded Death-rate. This year, for the first time, we have what is probably a nearly complete list of such deaths. The following table gives the number of deaths of Hornsey people in various institutions outside the Borough:— Edmonton Workhouse 24 Great Northern Central Hospital 28 Other general and special Hospitals 30 Lunatic Asylums 9 Various other places 10 101 11 Taking the registered number of deaths, viz., 607, deducting 12, and adding 101, gives the corrected number of deaths as 696. The greater part of the information as to the deaths outside the Borough has been supplied to me by the Middlesex County Medical Officer of Health, who has obtained from the Registrar General particulars of the deaths of Middlesex people in the Hospitals, etc., in and about London, and has apportioned these deaths to their respective districts. Before last year this correction for residents and non-residents had never been applied, and, although I then from the means at my disposal partly corrected the returns for several years back, I could only do it very imperfectly for want of the necessary information. Therefore, while the recorded death-rate for 1905 is a true statement of the mortality of the district, it is not comparable with the figures for previous years, because for these years a proper correction cannot now be applied. The effect of these corrections is to give Hornsey a recorded death-rate of 8.16. As I explained in my last report, before we can make a true comparison with other districts, a correction for age and sex distribution must be applied. This is done by multiplying the recorded death-rate, i.e., the death-rate corrected for residents and non-residents, by a factor for age and sex distribution, which has the effect of putting all districts on the same footing in this respect. In Hornsey, the age and sex distribution is more favourable than in the country generally, and we have accordingly a high factor. The rate obtained by this method is the Corrected Deathrate, and is the proper rate to use in comparing different districts. 12 The following table gives the corrected death-rates in a number of the great towns:— Hornsey 9.30 Halifax 16.57 Handsworth 11.16 West Ham 16.57 King's Norton 11.48 Bradford 16.94 Hastings 11.73 West Bromwich 16.94 Burton-on-Trent 12.52 Preston 17.91 East Ham 13.20 South Shields 18.08 Willesden 13.3 Leeds 18.10 Croydon 13.32 Nottingham 18.42 Tottenham 13.48 Birmingham 18.61 Northampton 13.52 Stockport 18.64 Reading 13.52 Swansea 18.98 Leicester 14.32 Stockton 19.56 Southampton 14.41 Bolton 19.67 Coventry 14.69 Sheffield 19.82 Wallasey 14.81 St. Helens 19.98 York 15.05 Bootle 20.16 Derby 15.41 Wigan 20.60 Bristol 15.53 Warrington 20.89 Cardiff 15.59 Blackburn 20.91 Norwich 15.77 Salford 20.98 Wolverhampton 15.82 Oldham 21.20 West Hartlepool 16.36 Liverpool 22.08 Smethwick 16.38 Middlesborough 23.06 Hull 16.50 Rhondda 23.21 13 Death-rates per 1,000 persons living 1887-1905. 14 1905. 1904.

The principal causes of Death were as follows:— Deaths attributed to Cancer 65 „ Heart diseases 64 „ Phthisis 58 ,, Old Age 56 ,, Bronchitis 50 „ Pneumonia 43 „ Apoplexy 36 ,, Premature Birth 22 ,, Brights disease 21 ,, Forms of Tuberculosis other than Phthisis 16 ,, Influenza 14 „ Marasmus 14 „ Convulsions 14 „ Accident 11 ,, Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of Liver 10 ,, Whooping Cough 10 ,, Obstruction of Intestine 10 „ Measles 9 ,, Diphtheria 8 ,, Pyaemia 8 „ Suicide 7 „ Epidemic diarrhœa 6 „ Scarlet Fever 3 ,, Enteric Fever 2 Fewer deaths occurred from the following causes, as compared with 1904:— 1905. 1904. Decrease Measles 9 18 9 Whooping Cough 10 17 7 Epidemic Enteritis 6 24 18 Phthisis and other Tubercular diseases 74 77 3 Premature birth 22 24 2 Bronchitis and Pneumonia 93 109 16 Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of Liver 10 15 5 17 From the following causes there were more deaths than in 1904:— 1905. 1904. Increase Scarlet Fever 3 1 2 Diphtheria 8 7 1 Cancer 65 49 16 Accidents and Suicides 18 14 4 From Heart Diseases (64), Enteric Fever (2), and Puerperal Fever (1), the number of deaths was the same as in 1904. Curiously enough, the number of deaths from Influenza (14) is the same as in 1904 and in 1903. The most serious increase in the number of deaths from any one cause is in the case of Cancer, an increase of 16. The yearly average number of deaths from this cause during the past 6 years has been 52. The subject is further referred to in another part of this report. From Epidemic Enteritis there have been 18 fewer deaths as compared with the previous year. This is due to some extent to the fact that climatic conditions did not favour the development of the disease so much as in the previous year. A good deal of work has been done in the districts where epidemic diarrhoea is most common, both in the way of discovering and causing to be remedied insanitary conditions, and by the distribution of leaflets containing information as to the proper feeding of infants. The courts, passages, etc., in the poorer districts have been regularly and frequently inspected, especially during the hot weather, so that no offensive conditions should remain long undetected. Measles and Whooping Cough caused 19 deaths, as compared with 35 in the previous year. Sixteen of the 19 deaths were those of children under 5 years of age. The relative importance of the various diseases, as causes of death, is shown graphically below:— 18 19 Tuberculosis.—Fifty-eight deaths occurred from consumption of the lungs, and 16 from other forms of tuberculosis, or 74 deaths from all forms of tuberculosis. Last year the figures were: Consumption of the lungs 54, other forms of tuberculosis 23; total for all forms of tuberculous disease 77. Year. Number of deaths from consumption of the lungs.

The thick horizontal line indicates the mean annual death-rate for these years. 21 The average annual death-rate from consumption of the lungs during the 13 years 1893-1905 has been 0.653 per 1,000 persons living. During this period the district has changed very considerably, parts that were quite rural 13 years ago now being covered with houses. Now, density of population has an important bearing on the mortality from consumption, and, when we consider that in 1891 Hornsey contained only 8 persons per acre, and these had increased by 1901 to 25 persons per acre, and in 1905 to nearly 30 persons per acre, we get some idea of the changes that have transformed a district once largely rural into one now entirely urban in character. The case of Muswell Hill is an extreme one, but in this Ward the number of persons per acre has increased from 5 persons per acre in 1898 to 16 persons per acre in 1905, i.e., in 7 years the population has become more than treble what it was. The following table gives the death-rates from all forms of tuberculosis in a number of towns where the population is approximately equal in number to that of Hornsey:— London Hornsey 0.868 Stockport 1.29 Finsbury 2.2 Northampton 1.33 Croydon 1.5 Middlesborough 2.32 Wolverhampton 1.31 Hastings 1.72 Coventry 1.34 Yarmouth 1.33 St. Helens 1.84 Preston 1.90 Huddersfield 1.75 Reading 1.45 York 1.65 Norwich 1.92 Swansea 2.13 The following table shows the deaths from phthisis and from all forms of tuberculosis in each of the Wards of the Borough:— WARD.

For early cases treatment for a period in a sanatorium would be of the greatest value, both from the curative and educational standpoint. I think there is a distinct need for both classes of accommodation in Hornsey, and it is to be hoped that in the near future something will be done to meet this want. In many cases disinfection has been carried out at houses where deaths from tuberculosis have occurred, and we are ready to do this in every case when allowed. Cancer.—The deaths attributed to this cause during 1905 numbered 65, a larger number than in any previous year. The number of deaths from cancer last year was 49, and the yearly average number of deaths during the 15 years 1890-1904, after the necessary correction has been applied owing to the great increase of population, is 50 deaths, so that in 1905 the deaths from cancer were 16 more than in the previous year, and 15 more than the average number of deaths for the past fifteen years. The following table gives the number of deaths from cancer with the death-rates for 16 years:— Year. Number of deaths from Cancer. Death-rate due to Cancer per 1,000 persons living. 1890 18 0.428 1891 22 0.492 1892 24 0.517 1893 37 0.762 1894 31 0.585 1895 22 0.393 1896 31 0.527 1897 30 0.485 1898 31 0.479 1899 43 0.635 1900 41 0.581 1901 47 0.653 1902 51 0.674 1903 62 0.790 1904 49 0.581 1905 65 0.762 23 The mean annual death-rate from Cancer for the sixteen years 1890-1905 was 0.590, and the average number of deaths per year from this cause has been 38, or, after allowing for increase of population, 50 deaths. The accompanying chart shows graphically the death-rates from cancer. It is seen that during the first nine years the rate was only once above the mean death-rate for the whole period, while during the last 7 years on only two occasions has the rate been as low as the mean. There is clearly a greatly increased mortality from cancer in the later years. Probably part of this increase is more apparent than real, and something must be allowed for a better classification of causes of death in more recent years. It is probable that, owing to advances in medical knowledge, many deaths are now correctly attributed to cancer which were formerly put down to other causes. The deaths from Cancer at different ages were as follows:— Age. Below 20 0 20-34 1 35-44 5 45-54 11 55-64 20 65-74 20 75 and over 8 Total 65 Ninety per cent. or the deaths occurred in persons over 45 years of age. The death-rates from Cancer for each Ward of the Borough are not given here. Cancer as a cause of death is, practically, only operative among that portion of the population over 40 years of age, and the death-rate from this cause ought to be calculated on the number of persons over 40 years of age, and not on the total population. Unfortunately the census returns do not give the number of persons at various ages for the separate wards, and as the proportion of persons over 40 years of age probably varies considerably in different wards any calculation that did not allow for this would be misleading. 24 Annual death-rates from Cancer per thousand persons living for 16 years 1890-1905. The thick line represents the mean annual death-rate for these years. The following table shows the Wards in which deaths from Cancer have occurred during the last 6 years: — Year. Highgate.

No light is thrown on the question of the possibility of house infection, but the figures are too small to allow of a reliable conclusion being drawn. There were only 3 cases out of 274 where 2 deaths had occurred in the same house, and this small number could be accounted for by mere coincidence. There has been no new evidence brought forward in favour of the theory of the infectious character of the disease, and it cannot be said that we know anything further as to its causation. As a possible preventive measure, disinfection is carried out at houses where a death from Cancer has occurred, whenever a request is received that this should be done. Deaths from Zymotic Diseases.—The Zymotic death-rate is the total number of deaths per 1,000 persons living from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz.:—Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Whooping Cough and Diarrhoea. The following table gives the deaths from these causes during 1905 and preceding years:-- 25 20  1905 1904 1903 1902 1901 1900 1899 1898 1897 1896 1895 1894 Small-pox 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Measles 9 18 15 7 8 4 6 14 7 6 13 5 Scarlet Fever 3 1 1 2 0 1 3 0 2 8 3 1 Diphtheria 8 7 12 9 10 14 4 11 16 12 21 23 Enteric Fever 2 2 0 5 2 6 0 4 0 6 5 6 Whooping Cough 10 17 19 9 14 18 20 8 10 17 10 22 Diarrhœa 6 24 1 1 6 9 32 15 29 9 8 1 Totals 38 69 48 35 40 52 05 52 64 58 60 58 The Zymotic death-rates in Hornsey and in England and Wales for the past years are as follows: — Zymotic death rate Hornsey.

Almost all the diseases are below the average of previous years as causes of mortality. Epidemic Diarrhœa has caused only 6 deaths, 5 of these being of infants under 1 year of age. Last year 24 deaths were attributed to this cause. Three of the deaths were in North Haringey, and 1 each in Crouch End, West llornsey and Stroud Green. This is equal to a Diarrhoea mortality of 3.82 per 1,000 birth?, or of 0.071 per 1,000 persons living at all ages. Diphtheria caused 8 deaths, out of 153 cases notified. This is one death more than last year. The case mortality is equal to 5.2 per cent. Of the 105 cases removed to Hospital, 3 proved fatal, equal to a case mortality of 2.85 per cent. Of the 48 cases not removed to Hospital 5 died, equal to a case mortality of 10.41 per cent. Enteric Fever caused 2 deaths out of 20 cases notified, equal to a case mortality of 10 per cent. Seven of the cases were removed to our Hospital, all of which recovered. Scarlet Fever caused 3 deaths, out of 261 cases notified, a case mortality of 1.14 per cent. Two of the deaths occurred in the Hospital, out of 177 cases removed from Hornsey, a case mortality of 1.12 per cent. Of the 84 cases not removed to our Hospital, most of which were treated at home, a few going to other Hospitals than ours, one died, equal to a case mortality of 1.19 per cent. Erysipelas caused 3 deaths out of 39 cases notified, and Puerperal Fever 1 death out of 3 cases notified. From Small Pox there were no deaths, one case only being notified. Ages at Death.—The ages at which deaths occurred are as follows: 28  1905. 1904. 1903. Under 1 year 106 145 132 1 year and under 5 years 43 66 53 5 years and under 15 „ 16 24 17 15 „ 25 „ 24 28 19 25 „ 65 „ 272 203 216 65 years and over 235 224 167 Total deaths 696 690 604 Nearly half the number of deaths were those of persons at the extreme ages, i.e., below 1 year or 65 years and over. Just over half the deaths were of persons of 65 years and over.

The infantile deaths amount to less than one-sixth of the total deaths. If we examine the causes of death among infants, we find that 34 were due to premature birth or congenital defects and 2 to accident, leaving 70 deaths attributable to disease arising from post-natal causes. Probably many of these deaths are in great part due to ante-natal conditions, leading to feeble vitality in the infants, for which in this country at least no remedy in the shape of municipal action has been adopted. The following table shows the infantile mortality for each Ward : — Number of deaths under 1 year.

Particulars, with the figures for previous years, appear in the following table: — Table showing the cases of infectious disease notified during 1905 and the ten preceding years: — Disease. 1905 1904 1903 1902 1901 1900 1899 1898 1897 1896 1895 Scarlet Fever 261 197 203 261 501 186 349 168 264 530 420 Diphtheria 153 101 62 99 134 107 101 99 87 96 93 Enteric Fever 20 16 15 38 35 32 22 31 31 35 48 Puerperal Fever 3 5 2 0 5 2 1 0 2 5 4 Erysipelas 39 40 25 33 40 45 42 51 39 39 45 Small Pox. 1 0 2 35 10 0 2 0 0 4 5 Total 477 359 309 639 725 372 517 349 423 709 615 The yearly average number of cases of infectious disease for the years 1895-1904, making the necessary correction for the great increase of population, is 615. The number of cases notified is 118 greater than in the previous year, but is 138 below the corrected average for the 10 years 1895-1904. Quarterly returns of cases of Infectious Disease : — 132 cases of infectious disease were reported during the first quarter of the year. (Corresponding quarter 1904, 62 cases). 108 cases of infectious disease were reported during the second quarter of the year. (Corresponding quarter 1904, 60 cases). 84 cases of infectious disease were reported during the third quarter of the year. (Corresponding quarter 1904, 97 cases). 153 cases of infectious disease were reported during the fourth quarter of the year. (Corresponding quarter 1904, 140 cases). The increase in the number of notified cases is really an increased prevalence of both Scarlatina and Diphtheria in the first and second quarters of the year. In the third and fourth quarters both diseases approached, or fell below, the level of the previous years. 35 1905. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria Enteric Fever. Erysipelas SmallPox. Pueperal Fever.

The attack rate per 1,000 of the population was 1.79, that for the previous year being 1.19, and the average attack rate for the years 1894-1904 being 1.50. There were fewer cases notified in Finsbury Park, North Haringey, and Highgate Wards as compared with the previous year, but a larger number in each of the other Wards. School infection played an important part in the causation of the disease. Enteric Fever.—Twenty cases were notified, as against 16 in the previous year. The number is well below the yearly average number of cases. Three of the cases were imported cases, the patients having been infected outside the Borough. In four cases the source of the disease was traced to direct infection from previous cases; in three cases there is some evidence that the consumption of shell fish was the cause, and in the remaining cases the cause of the disease is not known. 37 Isolation Hospital. 1905 1904. 1903.

In addition to the 177 cases of Scarlet Fever admitted from Hornsey, there were 54 cases of this disease admitted from Finchley, and 46 from Wood Green, making a total of 277 cases of Scarlet Fever admitted during the year. There were 2 deaths from Scarlet Fever during the year, both being Hornsey patients, the case mortality thus being 0.71 per cent. Diphtheria. Number of cases notified in Hornsey 153 „ removed to Borough Hospital from Hornsey 95 The proportion of cases removed to the Borough Hospital was 62 per cent. of the cases notified.

Of these, 7 patients died, three of the fatal cases being from Hornsey, 2 from Finchley, and 2 from Wood Green. The case mortality was 5.3 per cent. Several of the cases were in extremis on admission, and in 3 cases tracheotomy was necessary. The following table gives the number of cases of Diphtheria notified in Hornsey, with the death-rate; the total number of cases of Diphtheria admitted to the Hospital (including both Hornsey eases and others), with the mortality per cent. of the cases treated in the Hospital: — 40  1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 1902 1903 1904 1905 Number of cases of Diphtheria notified in Hornsey 50 63 43 138 117 89 95 87 99 101 107 134 99 62 101 153 Death rate per 1,000 of the population from Diphtheria — — — — — 043 0.37 0.20 0.25 0.17 0.05 0.19 0.10 0.11 0.10 0.08 0. 09 Number of oases of Diphtheria admitted to the Isolation Hospital 3 1 20 2 15 29 8 24 15 45 37* 45* 30* 50* 71* 92* 127* Mortality per cent. of cases treated in the Hospital 0 0 15% 50% 20% 24% 25% 4% 20% 13% 13% 11% 16% 14% 11% 4% 5% Cases admitted to Hospital from districts outside the Borough are included in these figures. 41 The number of outside cases of Diphtheria was for each year : 1899 1 case from outside the Hornsey Borough (or Urban District) 1900 8 cases do. 1901 2 „ do. 1902 15 „ do. 1903 36 „ do. 1904 36 „ do. 1905 32 „ do. During 1905, out of 153 cases of Diphtheria notified in Hornsey, 95 (or 62 per cent.) were admitted to Hospital. Practically all the patients were treated with antitoxin. Enteric Fever.—Fifteen cases of Enteric Fever were removed to the Hospital during the year, 7 being from Hornsey (out of 20 cases notified), 5 from Finchley, and 3 from Wood Green. Of the fifteen cases, 1 proved fatal (a Wood Green case), giving a case mortality of 6.6 per cent.

Mr. A. L. Bridge is the Inspector appointed under these Acts. His report for 1905 is as follows: — 44 SHOP HOURS ACTS. "During the year under review all the premises where young persons are employed in the Borough of Hornsey have been visited periodically. The number of visits paid to shops, etc., under the Acts is 850. The number of cards for exhibition left or sent amounts to 300. For the most part a change seems to have come over the lot of persons employed in shops, the old order changing and yielding place to new as contrasted with ten or a dozen years ago. To-day the more respectable traders give their assistants a weekly halfholiday. But the life of a London shopman or woman is not so favourable as in the provinces. The hours of drapers, etc., in provincial towns being on the average from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in winter and 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. in summer, with the usual weekly half holiday. Of course, conditions of city life are far different, the shopping hours in London being, in the suburbs, in the evening. So far as my experience goes, the weekly half holiday has not been prejudicial in any degree to the interests, either financial or physical, of employers or employed. As a rule shops are known in one area to close on Wednesday, and another area close by on Thursday, so that purchasers are never at a loss as to how to obtain household requirements suddenly. SEATS FOR SHOP, ETC., ASSISTANTS. This statute has had full attention. Seats are now for the most part provided. It is a matter of no small importance to young girls employed in shops for comparatively long hours that they should have ample opportunity for rest. I have often been struck by the courage shown by waitresses in busy tea rooms, etc., in the endeavour to hide the painful condition of their feet, due to long weary tramps from table to table. Seats in such cases are absolutely necessary. So far as Hornsey is concerned I find full attention is paid by employers to these matters. Only one complaint has been received during the past year, which had due attention." Employment of Children Act, 1903.—Mr. F. J. Pateman is the Inspector appointed under this Act. His report is as follows ; — 45 "This Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1904, and, after due inquiry, Bye-laws were framed and became operative in the Borough on the 17th January, 1905. With only 12 months' experience in the administration of this Act, any discussion as to its value from an educational and physical standpoint may appear premature. It is obvious, however, that where the condition of labour is detrimental to the educational and physical development of the child, any limitations provided by the Statute must prove beneficial to the community at large. A return submitted to the local authority in 1904 showed that there were within the Borough 570 children between the ages of 7 and 14 employed for wages out of school hours, their occupations being as follows : — Newspaper delivery 67, milk delivery 107, shop and errand boys 236, domestic work for wages 88, laundry work 33, street trading 6, other employments 33. The immediate effect of the Bye-laws was to— (a) release 185 children who were under 11 years of age from premature toil: (b) curtail in 96 cases the employment of children who were working more than 25 hours per week : (c) Abolish step-cleaning and street trading by children : and (d) indirectly to secure a more regular and punctual attendance at school. There are now about 450 children residing within the Borough employed within the limitations provided by the Bye-laws. During the year 116 children have been detected working contrary to the Bye-laws, and in each case notices have been issued to the defaulter. In 2 cases, however, where the employment was of a gross nature legal proceedings were instituted against the employers, and fines were imposed. The Officer's report book shows that— 30 children were engaged in street-trading. 31 „ „ „ in delivering milk. 6 ,, ,, „ in delivering bread. 2 „ „ „ in delivering newspapers. 29 „ „ „ as shop and errand boys. 11 „ „ „ as step-cleaners. 3 „ „ „ in laundry work. 4 „ „ „ in other occupations. 46 A notice was served upon the Acting Manager of a theatre for failing to send to the Local Authority, as prescribed by the Act, a Magistrate's licence authorizing him to engage 2 children in a series of entertainments. The following table will show the nature of the offences under the Act during the year : — Employed between 9 p.m. and 6.30 a.m. Employed between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Employed in prohibited occupations. Under 11 years of age. 39 31 38 8 The difficulty in administering this Act has been greatly increased by the influx of children from the adjoining parishes where Bye-laws are not in operation. These children are for the most part engaged as hawkers, step-cleaners, and milk-sellers. A return shows that of the 116 children illegally employed 41 reside within the Borough of Hornsey, 30 in London, 31 in Tottenham, 8 in Wood Green, 4 in Edmonton, 1 in Finchley, and 1 in Friern Barnet. There is a point on the economic side of the question of child employment to which I have directed my inquiries, viz., the alleged justification of sacrificing children to premature toil upon the ground of monetary needs of the parents. Taking the occupations of the parents of the children reported, I find that 37 were labourers, 4 hawkers, 1 horsekeeper, 4 railway porters, 5 bakers, 2 confectioners, 2 stokers, 2 engine drivers, 9 milkmen, 3 masons, 4 clerks, 8 painters, 3 bricklayers, 7 shoemakers, 2 coachmen, 2 newsagents, 4 carpenters, 2 carriers, 1 malster, 1 gardener, 1 wood-dealer, 1 dustman, 2 laundrymen, 2 messengers, 1 cat's meat purveyor, 3 widows. Now in some cases the system is part of the deeper problem of poverty where the child's earnings add to the small income of the family and bring relief; but from careful observation I am convinced that in the majority of cases no attempt could be made to justify the employment on the ground of poverty of the parents. The child's earnings are necessarily small, and cannot balance the disadvantage of an excessive use of their small working powers. I have failed to trace any case of hardship arising from the administration of this Act, and I am fully convinced that when the parents can be persuaded to form a right conception of their 47 duty they will consider the children's future rather than any present possible needs." Diseases of Animals Acts.—The Veterinary Inspector under these Acts is Mr. W. Lewis. The following table is a summary of the work done under the Diseases of Animals Acts : — DOGS. GLANDERS. Sidings at Hornsey Station. No. of times inspected. Seized. Owned. Destroyed. Outbreaks. Horses destroyed. 1st Quarter 136 4 132 3 10 3 2nd ,, 86 3 83 4 4 3 3rd ,, 81 1 80 2 3 3 4th 97 5 92 1 1 3 Totals for the year 400 13 387 10 18 12 The 10 outbreaks of Glanders occurred at the following places: 5 at the North Metropolitan Tramway Co.'s Stables, Finsburv Park, and 1 each at Osborne Stables, Stroud Green Road, Stables Scarborough Road, Stables Park Road, Stables Clarendon Road, and Stables Cross Lane. There have been fewer outbreaks of Glanders than in 1904 (10 against 12), but more horses have been destroyed in connection with these outbreaks (18 against 12). The number of dogs seized under the Rabies Order of 1897 is considerably greater than in 1904, viz., 400 against 277. A very insignificant proportion of the dogs seized is claimed by owners, by far the greater number being kept the requisite time and then destroyed. The sidings, gangways, etc., at the Hornsey Station have been in a satisfactory condition at each inspection. Movement of Swine.—Nineteen Certificates for the movement of swine into the Borough have been issued by the Medical Officer of Health, and 13 by the Veterinary Inspector. House to House Inspections in Campsbourne, Churchyard Bottom, and other areas of similar class property. 48 In these inspections 167 houses have been examined, with the following result: — Defective drainage re-constructed in 56 houses Defective water-closets repaired or replaced in 38 „ Defective check cisterns do. 8 ,, Water laid on for flushing purposes to water closets which had no water supply laid on 23 „ Defective drain inlets replaced 31 „ Defective soil pipes repaired 8 „ Defective paving repaired at 56 „ Defective or dirty drinking water cisterns attended to 23 Dust bins provided 25 Cesspools filled in 3 Dirty houses cleansed 31 Other nuisances abated 26 Certificates have been given by the Medical Officer of Health where exemption from Inhabited House Duty was claimed, in rcspect of 217 flats. In many cases the certificates were withheld for a time until various sanitary defects had been remedied. Water Supply.—Eight samples of water have been sent to Professor Kenwood for analysis, and in each case a satisfactory report was made. In a few cases houses have been found where the water supply was derived from a well sunk on the premises. Four wells have been found and closed during the year. Diseased and Unsound Food.—The following articles have been destroyed at the instance of the Local Authority during the year: — Fish 85 lbs. Fruit 50 lbs. Beef and Pork 18 cwt. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.—A comparison of the record of work done under this Act during 1905 and previous years shows a large increase in the work done during 1905. The number of inspections of premises made was 679 in 1905 and 570 in 1904. 49 The number of written notices served was 147 in 1905 and 67 in 1904. The number of sanitary defects discovered and remedied was 214 in 1905 and 124 in 1904. Register of Workshops.—The number of Workshops on the Register at the end of 1905 was 297, an increase of 66 as compared with the previous year. The Register now includes the following Workshops: — Dressmakers 65 Milliners 20 Bootmakers and repairers 44 Cycle makers and repairers 6 Farriers 5 Picture Frame Makers 4 Children's Outfitters 3 Tailors 11 Laundries 27 Restaurant Kitchens 25 Bakers 40 Miscellaneous 47 Sanitary Condition of Workshops and Workplaces.— The most common defect found on inspection was want of cleanliness. In 102 instances it was necessary to call the attention of the occupier to the dirty condition of the premises, but in no case was further action necessary, as the matter was promptly attended to. In 30 cases the arrangements made for ventilation of the workrooms were inadequate. In each case sufficient means of ventilation were provided without unreasonable delay. No cases of overcrowding of workrooms were discovered. In 5 of the 27 laundries the means provided for draining off the wet from the floors were insufficient. In each case the defective arrangements were remedied. Home Work.—There are 83 persons on the list of Homeworkers. Only 1 case of infectious disease has occurred in a house occupied by a home-worker. In this case the nature of the work and other circumstances rendered it necessary to prohibit the carrying on of the occupation for a time. 50 Bakehouses.—There are 40 Bakehouses in the Borough. One bakehouse has been added to the list during the year, and at one bakehouse the business has been discontinued, leaving the total the same as last year. Six of the bakehouses are underground bakehouses. Frequent inspections have been made, and, speaking generally, the condition of the bakehouses has been satisfactory. The Dairies and Milkshops, numbering 70, and the 3 Cowsheds have been frequently visited. In 25 instances the attention of the occupier has been called to contraventions of the bye-laws and regulations, and the matter has received proper attention. The number of premises now on the list for periodical inspection is 495, as compared with 412 last year and with 152 two years ago. The preliminary notices issued numbered 921, as against 901 in 1904, and 340 in 1903. The statutory notices served were 390, as against 138 in 1904 and 73 in 1903.
