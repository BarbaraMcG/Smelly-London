LEWIS 5 TOWN HALL, BARKING, ESSEX. September 1965. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barking. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In presenting my Annual Report for 1964 I wish to express my appreciation to the Members of the Council for their consideration and help throughout the year. In addition I should like to mention how appreciative I am of the loyal support given to me by my colleagues throughout 1964. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health 6 GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH EDUCATION During the year our Health Education programme has expanded considerably with more of our younger Health Visitors taking an interest in this subject and forming discussion groups among the mothers attending our clinics. Informality has been the keynote of such meetings and a great deal of stimulating 'talk' has resulted. The success of 'To Janet a Son' shown the previous year in the Small Hall, Barking Town Hall encouraged us to make further arrangements for the showing of this film in Woodward Hall on 26th October 1964 and we were gratified to find that on this occasion the hall was packed with an audience of over 150 and as one observer was heard to remark, "There were more fathers than mothers present". Much ore interest has been shown during 1964 by the Head Teachers Health Education and in fact it has been difficult to supply the appropriate personnel to meet the demand for talks to the children. I am delighted with this response and the amount of co-operation I have received in any arrangements made and in some schools Health Education has been included in the curriculum. Miss Benfield, our Superintendent Health Visitor has spent |much time, including many hours of her off duty spreading the cos pel of Health Education among voluntary groups throughout the town. These talks are summarised below:- Number of Lectures Type of Audience Number who Given attended 28 School Children 2,628 Nurses in Training 123 79 General Adult Groups 871 45 Youth Groups 646 HOME SAFETY The Home Safety campaign continued with press advertising and Posters as appropriate to the national theme suggested by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. All the opticians in the borough co-operated in a Sight Protection campaign by showing special posters on their premises and distributing leaflets to patients. Another special campaign related to the dangers of fireworks and members of the Junior Accident Prevention Council themselves distributed 500 leaflets and arranged for the display of 60 posters. The Junior Accident Prevention Council also organised to Quiz competition which attracted 163 entries. 1,500 copies of a booklet "Do It Yourself With Safety" were distributed with the aid of appropriate shops and several senior schools accepted supplies for use at woodwork classes. During the Christmas season 40 gross pencils, 100 dozen handkerchiefs and 1,000 booklets were issued to organisations holding children's parties. Talks and lectures were given to various local organisations. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 I am pleased to report that for the fourth consecutive year it was not necessary to take formal action to secure the removal of any persons from their own homes because they could no longer care for themselves. WELFARE SERVICE The Occupational Centre, situated in Eastbury House has provided for many of the Physically Handicapped a much needed social club and they have benefitted both in health and mental outlook. The table (on page 9 ) indicates the extent to which the various services provided by the County Council under the provisions of the National Assistance Act, 1948, have been afforded to persons having residence in the Borough of Barking during 1964. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1961-SECTION 41 It was not necessary to take action under this Section of the Act during the year. The Section provides for compensatory payments to persons excluded from work at the request of the Medical Officer of Health in the interests of public health.

CARE OF THE AGED Our Domiciliary services for looking after the aged are good in comparison with other areas in the country but there are still many gap . Though provision is made for meal vouchers, meals on wheels, home helps and visiting by our Health Visitors we need a Good Neighbour Scheme and Emergency Help Service for these old folk especially at weekends when they feel abandoned. Hospital Care is completely inadeguate, but in many cases when 'off colour' all these old folk need is to be kept warm, a comfortable bed and to be fed regularly. The more we can keep them among us in the community the happier they will be, so perhaps the answer to this problem might be a 'sick bay' in association with the old people's flats. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Licences were issued during the year in respect of four establishments which are governed by the Borough's bye-laws. In accordance with our requirements a hot water supply is available in each surgery. LAUNDRY SERVICE Our Minibus with its expert driver has continued to collect and deliver the laundry, mainly bed linen for 58 old people in the Borough and the number of articles dealt with in this way has increased from 13,135 in 1963 to 14,224 in 1964. 15 PATHOLOGICAL SERVICES Pathological Services are carried out for us by the Ilford and District Group of Hospitals, mainly at the Barking Hospital Laboratory. As previously recorded the staff are most obliging, and helpful and never grumble when given extra investigations to do for us. It is hoped that early in the new year the staff will be examining cervical smears for us, and assisting us in trying to prevent the development of Cancer of the Cervix. BARKING CHEST CLINIC During 1964, the work of Dr. J.T. Paterson and his staff has been considerably increased by the extra x-rays requiring to be taken in connection with the Ministry of Education Research project, and I do thank them most sincerely for their help. Statistics relating to the notification of cases are given below:- Respiratory Meninges & C.N.S. Other Total Transfers Into the area Total M. F. M. F. M.

The nursing attendance at the clinic sessions and the home visiting is done by two members of your nursing staff. 14 9 home visits were made during the year. 18 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES This section deals with those services which come under the control of the Barking Health Area Sub-Committee of the Health Committee of the Essex County Council. CLINIC PREMISES Woodward Clinic (now known as the Julia Engwell Clinic) During 1964 the re-building of this clinic continued, and the spacious accommodation provided, e.g. several consulting rooms, minor ailment rooms, sick-room cleansing unit, double dental suite, double chiropody suite, plus facilities for the teaching of Health Education, has been a source of great satisfaction. It is hoped that with the expansion of the services this clinic, or perhaps I should say Health Centre, will be in use, morning, afternoon and evening, and so be used to the maximum of its capacity. These new premises were actually occupied on 17.11.64 and the an enities provided are greatly appreciated both by patients and staff. (See Plate 2) Upney Clinic Our services in this part of the town have been greatly hampered by inadequate space. As a temporary measure we have the use of part of a pre-constructed building and though we have the right to occupy these premises till 1969, it is hoped that long before that year our new Upney Clinic will be in use. Blake Avenue Nursery The building of this Nursery was commenced during the year and we hope to take possession of the completed building sometime during the early part of 1965. Central Clinic This Clinic is hopelessly inadequate for the amount of 'traffic' it deals with. Our original plan for an extension will require to be altered and a much more ambitious scheme envisaged, either a much larger clinic to be rebuilt on the same site, or even on a new more suitable site, in the vicinity. 19 CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN Maternity Service Ante-Natal Care. This was given as follows:- Clinics 664 Hospitals (excluding Barking Hospital) 112 General Practitioners 282 Total 1058 Confinements. During the year 1059 mothers were confined, giving birth to 1073 infants (including 14 sets of twins). These were born as follows:- Barking Hospital 667 Other Hospitals 114 At Home 292 At Private Nursing Homes Total 1073 One patient failed to ask for ante-natal advice and ignored her condition. The first intimation of the pregnancy was when a midwife was called in for the actual delivery. Post-natal care. 534 Barking mothers attended the Post-Natal Clinic, making a total of 743 attendances. In addition 282 mothers were under the care of their family doctors and 112 attended the hospitals outside the district. Infant Welfare Attendances at Infant Welfare Clinics 1963 and 1964 1963 1964 Number of children born in year who attended 949 1,038 Total number of children who attended 3,361 3,457 Total attendances 20,132 20,672 Distribution of Welfare Foods.

Our Nursery Nurses who staff these sessions are expert in assessing the problem and assisting the adjustment of these children. During 1964 41 children attended for varying periods of time and their parents seem extremely grateful for the help they have received. Gale Street Nursery This Nursery continues to be a 2 year training school for nursery nurses. During 1964 we hud eight girls in training, three of whom sat the Final examination all successfully. The table below shows the attendances at Gale Street Day Nursery during 1964:- Number on Register Average daily attendances January 47 21.2 February 49 38.4 March 51 42.9 April 50 39.8 May 48 37.8 June 49 39.6 July 49 33.5 August 48 33.8 September 45 33.2 October 50 34.0 November 50 39.8 December 48 37.0 22 Nursery and Child Minders' Regulation Act There are two registered child minders in the Borouah. Women's Welfare Clinic Special sessions staffed by a medical officer and nurse trained in contraceptive techniques are held for women who are referred for medical reasons. During the year 262 patients made 572 attendances. Midwifery During 1964-5 Midwives were employed in the Barking area Twenty pupils did their district training and a total of 287 women were confined, which represents 27% of the births occurring in the Borough. Barking Hospital is a Part II Training Hospital for midwifery. Your Medical Officer of Health is approved by the Central Midwives Board to give the requisite public health lectures at the Barking Hospital Requests have been made by several G.P.'s for a midwife to attend ante-natal sessions at their surgeries. I am only too happy to encourage this co-operation. Supervision of Midwifes Miss E. O'Connor, Superintendent of the Lady Rayleigh Training Home, has continued to undertake the non-medical supervision of midwives. Health Visiting In 1964 our Health Visiting staff was further depleted by 2 retirements plus one Health Visitor moving to Gloucestershire. In spite of numerous advertisements none of these have been replaced This places an even greater burden of work on the others and prevents expansion of the work in this field. Selective home visits are now the 'rule' and more time is spent by the Health Visitor with the families who appear to need their help. During 1964 we have again received nursing students from various training centres for observation visits. The Superintendent Health Visitor has continued to give lectures to Student Nurses at Rush Green Hospital and to the Student District Nurses/Midwives from the Lady Rayleigh Training Home. The part time state registered nurses employed in clinic duties 24 assist the doctors and health visitors in carrying out treatment in all our clinics, and also help with school nursing duties. Their work contributes largely to the many services which are conducted from our Welfare Centres. Home Nursing This service, together with approximately half of the domiciliary midwifery service, is still administered from the County Training Home at Leytonstone. During 1964 because of the shortage of hospital beds an increasing proportion of acute medical cases were cared for in their own homes.

Chiropody treatment of school children is also done and 332 treatments were given. 26 Domiciliary Occupational Therapy-Tuberculous Patients Miss Z. Mercer, our Occupational Therapist, is still with us and continues to have a stimulating effect on all patients with whom she comes in contact. In addition to her normal duties she also visits the Physically Handicapped Club held at Eastbury House and we do appreciate her help. Patients are referred from the Chest Clinic by the Chest Physician, who is always available for consultation and to give advice when requested. First Visits 4 Re-visits 74 Visits to Clinic 5 Total Visits 83 No. of patients on Register 7 Sickroom Equipment Loan Scheme Over 1,700 articles have been loaned during the year and 1,482 were on loan at the year end. The standard of equipment available is steadily improving. Wheelchairs of the standard type are being replaced by and easy folding types which can be easily stored in small flats, carried upstairs and put in the boot of a car. The demand for wheelchairs would be even higher, but for the fact that so often the only person available to wheel the patient is the wife or husband who is seldom physically fitter than the patient. Bed pans are now made in a plastic material which is easy to sterilise. Rubber sheeting is giving way to plastic sheeting disposable incontinence pads are being used in increasing quantities. This has given rise to another problem - how to dispose of disposables' in a smokeless zone. The management of heavy patients in the home still constitutes a problem. Self-lift poles are available to those patients who, to some extent, can help themselves. In other cases hydraulic hoists are a great aid to the home nurse and the patients relatives who can manage to manipulate them, although they take up a great deal of space which can be ill-afforded in a small home. Domestic Help Service The Domestic Help Service has given valuable service in 920 cases and the following table shows the help given to the various categories of case during 1964: 27 Category No. of cases helped Hours of Service Aged 752 110,081 Maternity 31 1,406 Chronic Sick 125 22.945 (under 65 yrs.) Others (under 65 yrs.) 12 1,263 Totals 920 135,695 At the close of the year, 120 domestic helps were employed. The area Domestic Help Organiser has made 1,189 home visits, primarily of initial investigation, but having regard to the other time-absorbing aspects of her work, routine visiting lags far behind the desired standards and we hope in the near future to have an Assistant Organiser. During the year a further local training course was provided, the theme being "Home Help for the Expectant Mother". These courses are valuable, informative and they stimulated great interest amongst the Domestic Helps, It is hoped to develop and further the training of Domestic Helps during 1965. The "lighter side of life" for Domestic Helps has also progressed during the past year. Two socials, a theatre outing and the second Annual Dinner and Dance have been held. These functions were well attended and the Social Club is an outstanding success and the envy of home helps in surrounding areas. Night Attendance Service Allied to the Domestic Help Service, is the Night Attendance Service, which provides attendants to sit in at night with sick, elderly persons being nursed at home. During 1964, 1,378 hours of attendance were provided. Two Night Attendants were employed at the end of the year. Voluntary Associations Barking House, Clacton The holiday 'home from home' provided by the Barking Physically Handicapped Association has allowed many disabled people and their families to have a holiday and do 'just as they like' at the seaside. The 'Maintenance Department' comprising many willing helpers have several ambitious ideas for making this house even more suitable for its special visitors and if money is available these improvements should soon be effected 28 The Bungalow belonging to the Happy Go Lucky Club (situated Holland-on-Sea) is always fully booked as a holiday home for the mentally handicapped child plus the parents. These children who otherwise would never have been able to have a holiday withembarrassment, have happy holiday memories, just like their are fortunate friends, and so the 'workers' who include their rents, are amply repaid. Barking Junior Training Centre-Rippleside The staff of this centre have continued their social activities with the children throughout the year. These included swimming, Physical training, and netball matches with other centres and sits have again been arranged to places of interest. There were 92 children on the roll of the Centre at the end 1964. 29 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE 1964 REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN OF BARKING The information in this Section is given in my capacity as Divisional School Medical Officer of the Essex County Council. I wish to express my thanks here to Members of the Council and to all my colleagues in the Education and School Health Services for their help and co-operation during the year. 30 MEDICAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT The statistical return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found and the treatment thereof. Minor Ailment Clinics The attendances during the year at these clinics are as follows:- Cases Treated at Minor Ailment Centres EYES: (External and other-excluding errors of refraction and squint) 193 EARS, NOSE AND THROAT DEFECTS: (other than operative) 307 SKIN: Ringworm (scalp) " (body) 1 Scabies Impetigo 58 Other 1,541 Other minor ailments (e.g. minor injuries, bruises, sores, chilblains, etc.) 851 Total attendances 9,194 Speech Therapy Following the resignation of our one (only) Speech Therapist in August 1964 no treatment could be given until mid-October when Speech Therapists from Dagenham Health Department helped by covering three sessions per week at Central Clinic. Our grateful thanks goes to Dr. Gillet for his help. During the year, 904 attendances for treatment of speech defects were made at the Central Clinics, or during weekly visits to other centres. 152 children attended either regularly for ment or less frequently for observation. DENTAL SERVICES During 1964 we have been fortunate in increasing our dental staff and so it has been possible to carry out many more School dental inspections, do more dental health education and persuade the children that dental treatment of whatever kind can be painless. A Dental Health Exhibition week was held at Faircross School from the 16th March 1964 when we had the benefit of all the elaborate equipment of Essex County Council to assist us. From 1stJuly 1964 Mr. J. Whitelaw, our Area Dental Officer 31 was allowed to spend a proportion of his time in Dagenham with a view to trying to amalgamate the dental services with those in Barking. | This has proved a very profitable move and under his guardianship a first-class service should result. PROTECTION AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS B.C.G. Vaccination Our B.C.G. vaccination scheme continued during 1964 and the gratifying total of 629 tests undertaken by your doctors illustrates the co-operation of parents. The Chest Physician and his staff at the Barking Hospital have assisted us in all doubtful cases and their co-operation has been invaluable. The statistics regarding this service are as follows:- Number to whom offered 806 Number tuberculin tested after parents' consent had been received 629 Positive result 147 Negative result 482 Tuberculosis "Follow-up" Arising from the tuberculin testing survey, a child at a local school was notified us suffering from pulmonary tuberclosis, and all the children in his class together with the school staff were offered a check-up. The results of the tests were satisfactory, and the diagnosis of the child's illness was later amended to the of broncho-pneumonia. At another school, a child was found to be suffering from active tuberculosis, and again the staff and child contacts were offered a check-up. I am pleased to say that all the results were satisfactory. TYPHOID FEVER Protection against Typhoid was offered to pupils and teachers participating in school journeys abroad, and a total of 108 completd the course of inoculation. SPECIALIST SERVICES Eye Clinics Dr. R.F. Jamieson, M.B., Ch.B., D.O.M.S., is in attendance at Central and Porters Avenue Clinics. Appointments are made its far as possible to suit patients and parents. Cases dealt with were as follows:- External and other diseases (excluding errors of refraction and squint 49 Errors of refraction (including squint) 1,131 Total 1,180 The number of pupils for whom spectacles were prescribed was 752. Miss Lewis, Orthoptist (whose sanctum is at present in Upney Clinic), treated 108 schoolchildren during 1964. Pediatric Clinic Dr. T. Savage, Consultant Paediatrician, continued to hold aportnightly sessions at Upney Clinic till end of December 1964. from the following table it will be noted that the majority of Children seen by him are under school age:- New Cases Reexaminations Total Attendances School children 30 44 74 Under school age 179 297 476 Totals 209 341 550 Enuresis Clinic For the third year, a regular enuresis session has been held the Upney Clinic at fortnightly intervals; the Deputy Medical Officer of Health acting as Clinical Assistant to the Consultant paediatrician. During the year 147 children attended and 67 buzzers were issued. Ear,Nose and Throat Clinics Miss M. Mason, F.R.C.S., continues as the Consultant Ear, 33 Nose and Throat Specialist. Figures for treatment are:- Operative treatment (cases):- (a) For diseases of the ear 1 (b) For adenoids and chronic tonsillitis 94 (c) For other nose and throat conditions 20 Other forms of treatment (cases)184 Child Guidance I wish to thank Miss C. Helen Watt, Educational Psychologist, Ilford Child Guidance Clinic, for the following report on "The School Psychological Service in Barking":- "During the year, the remedial class at Monteagle Junior School has taken in more children and reached the maximum size which was envisaged for the class. In September one or two children had made enough progress to return to an ordinary class and one had reached Secondary School age so left for that reason; he had benefitted a great deal from the help he was given in the class and had reached a stage where he could read well enough to manage class work in a Secondary School. This left vacancies for more children to be admitted to the class from neighbouring schools. Both the remedial classes; the class at Roding Junior School and that at Monteagle School are providing a very valuable service for children who have fallen behind in their school work and who need intensive remedial teaching to enable them to work up to the level of their intelligence. There is still a need for one or two classes of this kind for children of Secondary School age. The Secondary Schools are we aware of the problem and are doing a lot to provide extra help within the ordinary schools for children who have learning difficulties. There are however a few very difficult cases who would make better progress if they were taken out of the Secondary Schools temporarily and given full-time or part-time remedial in a smaller unit with a view to returning them to the Secondary Schools when they had made sufficient progress. This would be of particular value to children who, besides being behind with their school work are emotionally too immature or too disturbed to cope adeguately with the social adjustment needed to fit in to the large community of a Secondary School. For these children, help in adjusting their attitudes to school life in a small school community can make it easier for them to learn to adjust later to a larger school. Plans have been made during the year for the new Greater London borough of Barking, which will include the present borough of Dagenham, to have its own School Psychological Service. Mr. Sheridan was appointed in August to take over 34 in the Dagenham school psychological area. We very much hope that the new borough will have its own Child Guidance Clinic and that it will be possible for Mr. Sheridan to commence work in the Barking Schools at the same time as provision being made for the new Child Guidance Clinic. From the point of view of liaison within the new borough of Barking, it would be of great value to have these services provided specifically for the new borough and to keep a close link between the School psychological and Child Guidance Services. " New Cases tested 65 Follow ups for schools 35 Follow ups for Clinic 23 Remedial education cases 11 Children referred to C.G.C. 5 Orthopaedic Clinic Mr. A.P. Bryson, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon succeeded Mr. Whitchurch Howell in July 1964 Mr. T. Hynd the Superintendent Physiotherapist does a wonderful job almost unaided. During 1964 11,033 treatments were carried out at this Clinic. Skin Clinic Dr. P.M. Deville, Consultant Dermatologist continues to attend once a fartnight for the treatment of various skin conditions. In addition one of our assistant medical officers acts as his clinical assistant and deals with cases of athletes foot and warts. 35 HANDICAPPED PUPILS A summary is given below of the ascertainment and placement of handicapped pupils during the year.

This school accepts three categories of handipupil - Delicate, Physically Handicapped and Educationally SubNormal - but the school is only divided into two Sections as the Delicate and Physically Handicapped children are educated together. Children are admitted from Dagenham, East Ham, Ilford South Essex and Romford, as well as from Barking. This schoo is scheduled for replacement and in fact the plans for this are airedy under way. E.S.N. Section Number on roll at the end of 1964 31 (includes 34 children from Dagenham, IIford, Romford and South-Essex).

TERRY 41 Section 2 - GENERAL ADMINISTRATION The routine work of administering the various Acts to premises of all types has continued throughout the year with regular visits bein made by inspectors. The statistics relating to this work will be found Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4. 1. Service of Notices During the year two thousand, two hundred and ten preliminary notices were served in respect of nuisances under various Acts and as a result of this informal action 2,177 of the notices were complied wil In the remaining 33 cases the Council authorised the service of formal notices. It was not necessary to institute legal proceedings for non- compliance with any formal notice. In certain cases the Local Authority is empowered to carry out work where the person responsible fails to do so. During the year suct action was necessary in only 2 cases. 2. Houses in Multiple Occupation Frequent routine visits were made to houses in multiple occupatic during the year and where necessary special visits at night have been undertaken to ensure that the number of persons occupying the premis did not exceed the prescribed limit. One hundred and sixty six inspetions were made at 42 houses and 9 notices were served to secure the amen ities necessary in such dwellings. Section 3 - HOUSING ACTS Clearance Areas Further progress was made during the year in accordance with the Council's scheme to re-develop the Gascoigne Area. On the 7th July a Public Enquiry was held to consider Objections to the proposed compulsory purchase of 152 properties in the Clearand Area known as Gascoigne Road (Area No.3). Objections were received on behalf of 7 premises and there were 14 claims for payments under Section 60 of the Housing Act 1957. Each objector maintained that the dwellings were net unfit for human habitation; if defects did exist they could be remedied at reoson able cost. The following extract from the official representation outlines the case presented for the Council. "The properties in the area were mainly constructed between 1891 and 1903. The bad internal arrangement, inherent defects, together with general disrepair and lack of amenities makes them inadequate for modern family life, and renders them unfit for human habitation. The efforts of some owners and occupiers to remedy the rapid decay of the properties have effected only a temporary improvement. The properties are generally old, decayed, obsolescent and worn out, without reasonable modern fitments or amenities. Roof slates are generally loose and perished, brickwork is soft, perished and porous. Such damp proof courses as exist have perished or fractured and there is considerable rising dampness in main walls. The sculleries are damp and dark. The staircases and w.c. apartments are badly lighted and ventilated. The wood floors are worn, uneven and show signs of settlement. Joinery is generally of light construction which is perished or damaged. The standard of decoration thioughout the area varies, but in many cases walls are stained and uneven as a result of dampness. Of the 152 premises in the area there are 64 with unsatisfactory ugly temporary back addition structures which have enclosed the w.c. apartment, drains and sink waste gully. These additions have become principal rooms where food is prepared and eaten. They are poorly lighted and ventilated and obstructive to the natural lighting and ventilation of the remaining ground floor rooms. The nature of the lean-to construction promotes condensation which supplements and aggravates the rising dampness in the roain structure. The entrance to the staircase is mainly either direct out of the living room or between the ground floor rooms, so that waste from the bedrooms must be transported through the living room and the scullery where food is prepared. This practice is prejudicial to health, especially in times of sickness. These staircases are steep, dark and dangerous. The w.c. apartments with few exceptions are external and without screened approaches. There are 130 houses without entrance passages, and in houses an entrance passage has been formed by the erection of a partition of light construction, whilst the remaining 17 houses have proper entrance passages. 43 The secondary access to the dwellings is along narrow, unpaved, unlighted passageways, through pools of water in bad weather. Because of the long terrace type of construction the length of carry for the removal of refuse and delivery of fuel is in excess of accepted standards. Bathing facilities exist in 29 properties as follows:- There are 5 dwellings with separate bathrooms in the main building, and 9 dwellings with a bath fixed in the scullery. In 12 cases baths have been fitted in a temporary structure; in one house a bath has been installed in the roof space and in another the bath is fitted in a living room. One shower bath is fitted in a scullery. Hot and cold water is provided to 7 baths; cold water only to 5 baths and in 2 cases the bath is served by a geyser only. The remaining 14 baths are not provided with water supply." The inspector conducting the Public Enquiry on behalf of the Minister of Housing and Local Government found that all the houses J in the clearance area were unfit for human habitation and the best ml of dealing with conditions in the area was by demolition of all the 1 properties. The Compulsory Purchase Order was confirmed by the Minister! without amendment. During the year three further Clearance Areas were represented! the Council who declared as unfit dwellings the following:-® Premises Families Crispe Road Clearance Are 27 28 St. Pauls Road (No.5) Clearance Area 71 72 Gascoigne Road (No.4) Clearance Area 99 111 Section 4 - FOOD SUPPLIES (a) Food Premises A total of 782 premises in the Borough are used for the sale and storage of food and the number of visits made to these premises during the year was 2,722. The tendency is for more and more of the trade to concentrated into the hands of multiple and self-service stores with large turnovers. Problems arise from inadequate provision being mode for storage in shops where the increased sales are over estimated. (b) Food Sampling Your officers took 218 samples for analysis by the Public Analys during the year. In 16 cases where the food was considered not to be 44 enuine the action taken is set out in the schedule on table 18. Complaints of Unfit Food During the summer months there was a slight increase in the number of food complaints received from the public. In cases where legal proceedings were considered to be unwarranted, informal action resulted satisfactory conclusions. The action taken in the other cases is sted in table 10. Corned Beef The outbreak of typhoid fever at Aberdeen had repercussions troughout the country. In June, information was received indicating the embossed inscriptions of 6-1 b cans where unchlorinated river water ed been used for cooling the tins after cooking. All routine inspections by the Borough's Public Health Inspectors vere suspended for a short period of time and the entire staff concentreted on an all-out effort to trace any such tins of corned beef. Five hundred and twenty two visits were made to cooked meat thops, butchers, grocers, cafes, restaurants, schools and canteens and stocks of 6-1 b tins examined. This mammoth task was greatly helped by the eager co-operation tiven by the trade and as a result 79 tins were located and withdrawn om sale. During this period all occupiers of food premises were sent a letter emphasising those sections of the Food Hygiene Regulations which should be strictly observed by all food handlers and having articular reference to personal cleanliness. Section 5 - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 Domestic Smoke Control In accordance with the Council's plan to control domestic smoke troughout the Borough by 1965, three further Smoke Control Orders become operative during the year. The remaining three areas were -Yed and reported to the Council: it is hoped that they will come operation on 1st November, 1965, when the whole Borough will be nubject to smoke control The following table shows the situation at the end of 1964:- 45 Co-operation by the public continues to be good but it was necess to send 36 warning letters to residents in existing Smoke Control Arereminding them that the emission of smoke from unauthorised fuels is an offence. (b) Industrial Smoke Thirteen notifications of intention to install new furnaces were received during the year. Of these, ten were oil fired furnaces, one was a gas fired oven and two were gas fired incinerators. It will be observed that the tendency for new installations to be oil fired continues. This change over from solid fuel shcu Id reduce smoke emission to a minimum Observations continue to be made on chimneys from large indus- trial boilers. One hundred and eighty such observations were made and there were eleven contraventions of the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periool Regulations 1958. In most of these cases warning letters were sent to the firms concerned. considerable nuisance has been caused over a long period by the emission of smoke from a furnace used for the recovery of metal by burning scrap cable. This is a registerable process under the Alkali & Works Regulations Act, 1906 and is under the jurisdiction of the Alkali Works Inspector to whom the matter has been reported. The Minister of Housing and Local Government was also approached, but it appears that this problem is nation-wide and of considerable magnitude. In this case a new furnace is to be installed fitted with a suitable after burner, which should reduce the emission of smoke. (c) Measurement of Pollution The two volumetric filters at Eastbury House and Rosslyn Road School have been working throughout the year, with the exceptjion of the month of April when the apparatus at Eastbury House was out of commission. A third filter was installed at Thames View Clinic and commenced operation in November. These filters measure the smoke 46 Area No. Date of Operation No. of Dwellings Dwelling converted for burning smokeless fuel 1 1st January, 1962 4,550 2,650 2 1 st November 1962 1,864 1,315 3 1st November, 1962 2,365 1,113 4 1st November, 1963 1,728 1,235 5 1st November, 1963 2,949 1,223 6 1st November, 1964 1,421 848 7 1st November, 1964 1,569 326 8 1st November, 1964 2,446 135 9 1st November, 1965 589 10 1st November, 1965 1,337 Awaltinq Confirmation 11 1st November, 1965 1,077 and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and the results are shown in Graphs Nos. 1 and 2. D Co-operation with other Authorities The Council are represented at the Standing Conference of Cooperating Bodies for atmospheric pollution which meets under the cuspices of the Departmen t of Scientific and Industrial Research. The Conference co-ordinates the activities of all authorities and organisations carrying out atmospheric pollution measurements. Council represen tatives continue to take part in discussions with bouring authorities in connection with the administration of the Clean Air Act. The discussions mainly concern Smoke Control Areas the problems that arise in connection with them. Supplies of smokeless fuels and extensions of the grant scheme have been fully investigated and have been the subject of correspondence the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The problem of tiese fumes from motor vehicles has also received attention. Recen Legislation Section 95 of the Ho using Act 1964 made some important amendto the Clean Air Act, 1956. Grants can now be paid for to places in houses built before 16th August, 1964. If there shortar e of a certain type of smokeless fuel, the local authority by resolution, declare certain types of heating appliances to be gible for grant. Circular 60/64 provides that grant cannot be paid fu ture for direct acting electric space-heaters. Grants can now be on work carried out without approval, between the date the Smoke on trol Ord r was made and the date of confirmation. Another change at appnval can be given to expenditure incurred in providing tion onl; to a heating appliance. Section 6 - PEST INFESTATION CONTROL Rodent Control The systematic treatmen t of sewers in accordance with the commendations of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as carried out twice during the year. Baiting was carried out by a specialist firm using Sodium cetate (1081). It is encouraging to note that the number of man- showing pre-bait take has shown a marked reduction. The regular treatment of industrial premises maintained an tive control of surfa ce infestations. The following extract from the Annual Report submitted to the of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the year 1964 indicates the incidence of Rodent Infestation, in the Borough, dealt with by your officers. 1 2 3 4 Local Authority Dwelling Mouses including Council Houses All Other including business premises Totals of Columns 1, 2, 3 Number of properites in Local Authority's District. 42 22,764 3,504 26,310 Total number of properties inspected as a result of notification. 6 155 46 207 Number of such properties found to be infested by:Common Rat - Minor 2 69 15 86 House Mouse - Minor 4 86 31 121 Total number of properties inspected in the course of survey under the Act. 16 217 233 Number of properties found to be infested by:Common Rat - Minor 16 198 214 Number of infested properties in Sections 2,3,4, treated by L.A. 22 155 244 421 Total treatments carried out including retreatments. 22 155 244 421 (b) Mosquitoes , During the summer months six inhabitants in the neighbour hood of Thames View Estate complained of nuisance from gnats and mosquitoes in the area. An extensive search was carried out for all possible breeding grounds. The insects were found to be breeding in water butts, variours ditches and pools of water on vacant land to the South and East of the Estate. The larvae in these breeding grounds were destroyed by spraying. 48 A reduction in the numbers of adult gnats, and mosquitoes resulted rom this action. Fly Control Vacant sites and the yards of food premises were regularly sprayed th a suitable insecticide to control flies of all types which breed in and infest such areas. Disinfestation of Verminous Premises During the year we received complaints of vermin infestation from residents. Most of the infestations were minor and were resolved by simple tment with insecticidal spray. The total premises comprised:- Barking Council dwellings 8 London County Council dwellings 6 Privately Owned dwellings 9 Section 7 - OFFICES, SHOPS & RAILWAY PREMISES ACT 1963 This Act, which came into operation during the year placed much ditional responsibility on the Public Health Inspector. The scope the Act and the many detailed items of equipment required to satisfy various regulations necessitated thorough inspections of premises therto administered under the provisions of the Shops Act and mises where no standard of amenities had previously been laid down. In order to expedite registration, notification forms (0.S.R.I) were patched to all premises in the Borough, likely to come within the cope of the Act. By the end of the year 594 registration forms had been received and the task of carrying out general inspections was undertaken by the blic Health In spentors. A breakdown of the premises registered and general inspections led out is as follows:- Number of Premises Registered during the year. Number of Premises receiving General Inspection under the Act.
