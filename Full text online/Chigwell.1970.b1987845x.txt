(a) (b) (c). -2- To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS, I have pleasure in presenting the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1970, which includes the Annual Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector. This Report is compiled in accordance with the Public Health Regulations. 1970 was the year in which much was said and written about the shortcomings of our social and physical environment: Our social surroundings are said to be characterised by increasing crime and delinquency, addiction to alcohol, tobacco and other more harmful drugs; our physical environment to be poisoned by polluted air and water, intolerable noise, tasteless and adulterated food - all endured in "an urban wilderness of grey concrete blocks, devoid of community." It is well that we should be kept constantly aware of these hazards to our well-being; but it is also incumbent upon each and every individual to play his part on the side of the angels by adopting and encouraging higher standards of personal conduct and effort rather than indulging in futile protests and demonstrations against "the Authorities". The environment and "the Authorities" are, in fact, ourselves, and can only be influenced by the efforts of individual people. Although much remains to be done, and new problems are continually arising, much has already been achieved: Deaths from infectious disease are almost a thing of the past; we have abundant clean, safe water to drink; fog is rare, and the beauty of London's buildings can be seen again; our own local records of atmospheric pollution show a decrease in the amount of smoke by two-thirds and the amount of sulphur dioxide by one half, over the past 10 years; our clearance of slums is almost complete. All this has been achieved by the determination, encouragement and civilised behaviour of people in general during their everyday work and lives. To my mind, conservation means nothing more than the continuation, or the revival, of these standards. The government's proposals for the future Reorganisation of Local Government and of the National Health Service, were the subject of much study and thought during the year, and the implications were widely discussed, A further review, which is still in progress, followed the change of government in June, 1970, and I find it pleasing to note the changed tendency in favour of smaller though viable areas of local government, and towards a unification of the National Health Services. VITAL STATISTICS The steady fall in the birth-rate observed in recent years appears to have been arrested, but the present rate for the District (after adjustment for age/sex differences) at 12.3 per 1,000 of the population is still well below the national average, which is 16.0. The death rate (adjusted) has fallen from 9.3 per 1,000 to 7.9, mainly due to less deaths from cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic bronchitis. (The average comparable rate for England and Wales remains virtually unchanged at 11.7). The death rate of infants under 1 year was 13 per 1,000 live births, compared with the national average figure of 18 for England and Wales. -3- /On On the whole, therefore, we can say that the health of the District has continued to be satisfactory. CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Again there were no major outbreaks and no deaths from any of the notifiable infectious diseases, but several incidents of a minor nature may be of some interest. 1. 2 cases of infective jaundice occurred at High View Residential School just before the Christmas holidays. While the school was closed for the ensuing holidays and the children were living at home with their families, a further 3 cases arose; 1 of these returned to school before recovery, and was immediately isolated until sent back home a few hours later. Despite special attention to personal hygiene and food hygiene at the school a further 2 cases occurred. I therefore decided to offer an injection of immune gamma-globulin to all the children and staff. 83 children and 32 staff were so inoculated, and I am happy to report that no further cases occurred. 2. During the national scare and controversy over rabies (March 1970), a local veterinary surgeon reported being bitten while destroying a dog which was seriously ill with an unidentified disease. The premises were immediately disinfected and the contact put under surveillance. Full detailed examination of the dog's head was arranged through the Divisional Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but in consultation with the Central Virus Laboratory, it was decided not to vaccinate anyone against rabies pending the results of the examination, as the dog had never been abroad or in remotest contact with that disease. Fortunately, all the tests, as expected, proved conclusively negative. 3. A local veterinary surgeon reported suspected tuberculosis in a cat whose owner was also known to be suffering from this disease, and requested my assistance in obtaining materials for a diagnostic test. After studying the general literature on the subject of tuberculosis in domestic animals, and some correspondence with one of the authors, I reported to the Society of Medical Officers of Health my opinion that whenever tuberculosis is diagnosed either in man or domestic animal the Medical Officer of Health should be informed and all members of the domestic circle, human and animal, should be examined. The Society is seeking further advice with a view to implementing this proposal. It is now apparent that measles vaccination reduces the risk of the disease in the year immediately following the administration of the vaccine, but not in subsequent years. It is estimated that a vaccination rate of 40 to 50% of the children born each year would be necessary to prevent the regular biennial epidemics of measles experienced in Britain up till now. A continuing rate of 80 to 90% would however be necessary to lead to the total disappearance of the disease from this country. German measles (rubella) vaccination introduced last year, has continued to make progress under new arrangements between the Essex County Council and the local general practitioners. The purpose of the scheme is to give protection against the disease during the first few weeks of pregnancy, which can result in severely handicapped babies. It must therefore be given well before a pregnancy is likely to have started and is accordingly offered to girls in the 11 to 14 age group. —4— /SECTION SECTION 47, NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951 AND 1962 7 cases in possible need of care and attention were investigated during the year and kept under observation with the services of the district nurse, home help, meals-on-wheels, as necessary. Subsequently, 1 case was admitted to hospital under the provision of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951; 1 case was voluntarily removed to hospital. MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF STAFF In connection with their appointment for duties with this Council, 50 officers and staff completed Personal Report forms which were duly assessed; 16 received a medical examination. 5 employees were re-assessed and reported on for sick-pay and superannuation purposes, following prolonged periods of sick-leave or retirement. 2 employees were examined in connection with their employment as heavy vehicle drivers. RE-HOUSING PRIORITY ON MEDICAL GROUNDS 117 requests for priority for re-housing on medical grounds were referred to me for assessment, usually supported by a doctor's written certificate. Each case was fully investigated and my recommendations were as follows:- Diseases or Conditions Total Applicants Priority Recommended Priority Not recommended Asthma, bronchitis, catarrhal diseases etc. 17 10 7 Blood pressure 4 2 2 Heart disease 6 6 - Nervous disease (anxiety states, neurasthenia, neurosis etc.) 45 20 25 Rheumatism 8 5 3 Tuberculosis 4 1 3 Other diseases 4 1 3 Other conditions 29 11 18 117 56 61 The 61 applicants not recommended for medical priority include (1) Illness not aggravated by housing conditions; (2) Temporary indispositions; (3) Those pleading the discomforts of overcrowding and structural defects (i.e. grounds other than medical); (4) Repeated requests already assessed. As this report is being prepared, Mr. R. Roper completes a life-time of service to Local Government on reaching the age of retirement, and is succeeded as Chief Public Health Inspector by Mr. Peter Riley, who comes from a similar post with Waltham Holy Cross Urban District Council. All will wish Mr. Roper good health and contentment in his retirement, and good fortune and fulfillment to Mr. Riley in his new appointment. Finally, I would again like to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support, and to the staff of the Department for their continued enthusiasm and loyalty. To all who have provided me with statistical and other information for inclusion in this report, my grateful acknowledgements are also made. H. FRANKS,M.B.,B.S.,B.Hy.,D.P.H.

Windle Taylor, the Director of the Water Examination Department of the Metropolitan Water Board, has kindly supplied the following information regarding the water supply for the district:- "1. (a) The supply was satisfactory both as to (i) quality, and (ii) quantity throughout 1970. (b) All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains; and the mains are returned to service only after the analytical results are found to be satisfactory. The quality control of these laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from sources of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system, and through to the consumer. Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated. (c) (i) The Board has no record of the number of structurally separate dwelling supplied in your area, but the population supplied direct according to the Registrar-General's estimates at 30th June 1970, was 56,500. (ii) No houses were permanently supplied by standpipe. (d) No artificial fluoride is being added, and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water. 2. (a) The supply was derived from the following works and pumping stations:- Lee Bridge Works and between May and September from Coppermills Works. Well water occasionally from Chingford Mill and Waltham Abbey pumping stations. No new sources of supply were instituted and there were no changes to the general scheme of supply in your area. The number of samples collected and the bacteriological and chemical analyses of the supply from the above sources after treatment are shown on the attached sheets. (b) On account of their hardness content and alkaline reaction the Board's river and well water supplies are shown to be not plumbo-solvent. It should, however, be appreciated that all types of water pick up varying amounts of metal from the material of water piping particularly when it is /newly -1.7- newly installed; this applies to copper, zinc, iron and also to lead.

Edwards, C.Eng.M.I.C.E.,M.I.Mun.E.,A.M.B.I.M., Engineer and Surveyor, has kindly supplied the following information - (a) Drainage and Sewerage; The soil drainage from the greater part of the District gravitates to the main disposal works at Luxborough which was improved in 1938, was extended after the war and recently has been further improved with the addition of final effluent and storm water treatment lagoons. A scheme for a further extension has now been approved by the Ministry consisting of more filters and humus tanks and is expected to start soon. A small part of the District drains to the Millers Lane Sewage Disposal Works from whence the Council has now decided to lay a trunk sewer to take the flow to the Luxborough Lane Works, thereby eliminating the need for a second Disposal Works at Millers Lane. -19- The The completion of these improvements is expected to result in a continued high standard of purity in the effluent to be discharged to the River Roding. As regards sewerage, the Council is faced not only with the increasing foul flows from the new development, but also with some ageing and unsatisfactory sewers which contribute to the flooding difficulties referred to below. Generally, there is a separate system of drainage in the District except in the older parts where combined sewers still exist. These combined sewers have caused flooding at various points in the District and work has started on the laying of new surface water sewers to remove part of the flow from the combined sewers in South Loughton and Buckhurst Hill and thus from the Sewage Treatment Works. Schemes costing a total of £250,000 have been completed but there is still more work to be done. A small area of Buckhurst Hill drains into the sewers of the London Borough of Redbridge at Woodford, thence via Chingford and to the East Middlesex Scheme. Part of Chigwell Row drains to the London Boroughs of Redbridge and Barking. There are 5 outlying pumping stations lifting the flow from low lying areas up to the main gravity sewers. (b) Public Cleansing: Domestic refuse is being collected once weekly throughout the District by the Council's vehicles and labour. A fleet of 7 compressing type refuse collection vehicles is constantly employed, supplemented by further vehicles for special collections, including a FREE service for removing bulky domestic articles (e.g. mattresses, bedsteads etc.) on request from householders. THIS FREE SERVICE CANNOT BE PUBLICISED TOO MUCH as it is provided to combat the other alternative of tipping old mattresses, etc. into ditches or onto forest land or roadside verges. The new Civic Amenities Act will also be of help in combatting this problem and refuse is received at the Luxborough Lane Depot on Saturdays and Sundays. Trade refuse also is collected, a charge related to actual cost being made only for refuse, the character of which is clearly not domestic. Until now, refuse has been disposed of by controlled tipping in Chigwell at a site leased to the Council. The refuse was covered with spoil, hardcore or other innocuous filling, and during tipping, only a very small surface of refuse remained uncovered. Measures were taken against flies etc., as necessary from time to time, but this rarely happened. As this tip is now full, further and more long term arrangements for refuse disposal have been made at great cost to the ratepayers because other possible controlled tip sites are not available within the District. Transportation of refuse in bulk to tips in outer Essex started in April, 1969 using 3 large bulk transporter vehicles and from the new Transfer Depot in Luxborough Lane. Salvage -20- Salvage of paper continued to produce sales during the year, Trailers have been purchased for attachment to the refuse vehicles so that salvage can be better pre-separated before tipping. Nearly 5,000 road gullies in County and District roads are emptied (and re-sealed with clean water) by machine regularly during the year by contract. (c) Swimming Pool: The Council's swimming pool has had another very successful year. It is a real asset to the District, particularly for Children and clubs, and the total number of users was 271,844 for the year's operation. A smaller teaching pool is proposed as the next stage and possibly a sauna bath later. 3. RIDING ESTABLISHMENTS ACT, 1964-1970 The riding establishments in the area have been inspected and Mr. H.E. Bywater,M.R.C.V.S.,F.R.S.H. reports as follows:- I have pleasure in submitting my report of visits made to the riding schools licensed by your Authority during the year 1970. Inspections were made at varying times in each quarter of the year, and often on varying days for the individual establishments. Conditions were, in general, satisfactory and no contraventions of the 1964 Act were observed. No complaints have been made to me during the whole time that I have acted for your Authority but a complaint was made to the police concerning one riding school in which an alleged infringement of the Protection of Animals Act of 1911 was reported. This complaint incidentally would have been more relevant to the Riding Establishment Act, however, the police thoroughly investigated the matter and found no grounds for further action. In January, 1971, the provisions of the 1970 Act come into force. The new Act strengthens some of the provisions of the 1964 Act regarding the fitness of a person to be licensed or in charge of a riding school and the well being of the horses used for hiring. It makes it illegal to leave in charge, or allow instruction to be given by, a person under the age of sixteen. A notice must now be displayed on the outside of the riding school concerning the action to be taken in the case of fire with the name, address and telephone number of the person or persons to be contacted. A current insurance policy must be held to cover injuries to riders. All the establishments in the area are very close to the managers' residences or other habitations, and all owners have had insurance cover for a number of years. The riding school at Chase Lane changed ownership during the year and the new owner-manager appears to be conducting the establishment in a very satisfactory manner. I -21- I attach a list of the licensed premises, the owners or managers and the average number of animals inspected:- Nightingale Riding School. Epping New Road. Buckhurst Hill: Owner-Manager: Mr. T.
