Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for 1958. Vital Statistics It is interesting to note that this year the Registrar General estimates the mid-year home population of the Borough as 115,700. This is a reduction of nearly 5,000 on his estimate for the previous year. From 1953 to 1957 there had been an estimated reduction of only 3,000. The decennial census of population will be held in 1961, and those figures will be available shortly afterwards. Infectious Disease I would like to draw your attention to the fact that although there were only five cases of poliomyelitis notified in the borough in 1958, they were all paralytic. No less than three terminated fatally, and all were adults of over 30 years. This underlines the importance of poliomyelitis immunisation, and the necessity of including the adult population in this respect. Smoke Control Areas Considerable attention continues to be paid by the department to this most important aspect of our work. Details are contained in the body of the report, and it is pleasing to record that it was possible to complete the preliminary and final survey during the year of the Hyde Park Ward. This important work will continue until the entire borough becomes a Smoke Control Area within the next ten years. Already plans are well advanced in respect of the Lancaster Gate East Ward. Slum Clearance On the 6th January, 1958, the Council made the Paddington Borough Council (Braithwaite Place and Adpar Street) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1958. On the 17th June, 1958, the Minister of Housing and Local Government held a Public Enquiry to hear objections to the Order, and at the end of the year the Minister's decision was being awaited. This was the largest Slum Clearance project ever undertaken by the Paddington Borough Council and I would like to express my admiration of the skill and care shewn by your Area Inspector, Mr. V. L. Ronchetti, in the detailed and extensive work associated with this slum clearance. Report of the Borough Analyst For the first time is included the Report of your Public Analyst (C. Harcourt Wordsworth, B.Sc., F.R.I.C.). Mr. Wordsworth has been your Analyst since 1949 and I felt you would wish to receive from him personally an account of the important duties he is undertaking on behalf of the Council. Mortuary On the 1st October, 1958, the Paddington Mortuary was closed jn anticipation of the development of the Hall Park area for housing 4 purposes. An arrangement was made with the St. Pancras Borough Council for Paddington cases to be accepted in their new mortuary. This new scheme has worked exceedingly smoothly and appreciation is expressed to our colleagues in St. Pancras for the help we have received from them. A considerable financial saving to the Borough has been effected by the new arrangement. Staff During the year Mr. A. C. Harrison was promoted to fill the vacancy of Chief Food Inspector, occasioned by the tragic death of his colleague Mr. F. J. Pallet. Miss Amor, who had previously divided her duties as between inspection of food shops and outworkers and the care of the elderly, became full-time assistant to the Chief Food Inspector. Mrs. Short, S.R.N., was appointed to undertake the duties in connection with the care of the elderly previously performed by Miss Amor, and also to undertake the investigation of infectious disease in the northern part of the borough. Conclusion I would like to express my gratitude for the help and co-operation I have received from the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H. LESLIE OLDERSHAW, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, 14-15, Park Place Villas, London, W.2. Tel.

In accordance with the directions contained in the Minister's Memorandum on Smoke Control Areas, consultations took place at officer level following the preliminary survey. On the advice of the officers of the Ministry it was agreed that the area referred to above should be the subject of two orders instead of one, mainly due to the large redevelopment which is proceeding in parts of the area concerned. The first Order it is anticipated will operate on the 1st October, 1959, and the second Order on the 1st October, 1969. At this stage I think it would be helpful to give a brief outline of the procedure which had to be followed for the preparation of the necessary information before submitting to the Minister the salient features of the project to which the Council is committed. In particular I wish to refer to the excellent work of Mr. G. S. Adams, the Area Public Health and Clean Air Inspector who, with the assistance of one clerical officer and the three student Inspectors (as and when their duties permitted) enabled me to submit my recommendation to the Council for the adoption of their first Smoke Control Area. The first Order designated " Hyde Park No. 1 Smoke Control Order, 1959 " comprises 11 industrial premises, 131 commercial premises and 2,658 dwellings, all of which had to be visited and the requisite information obtained as to the form of heating and the amount of fuel consumed; also particulars as to the installations which would require adaptation or replacement to comply with the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956. The estimated total cost involved is £2,054 made up as follows. New appliances of different types to be installed amount to 103 at an estimated total cost of £855; total cost of other works attributable to installation of new appliances is estimated at £762; adaptation costs and provision of gas or electric points is estimated at £437. Of this total cost of £2,054 the Council's share is three-tenths estimated at £616. The balance is met by a grant of £822 from the Minister, and the owners or occupiers contribution of three-tenths, estimated at £616. As the Council are aware this important work will continue until the whole of the borough has been covered. The question of providing adequate assistance has been a problem and is receiving my serious consideration. As will be appreciated no technical assistance can be provided and therefore the final survey had perforce to be undertaken by Mr. Adams in addition to his Area Public Health Inspector's work. However a start will be made early in 1959 on the preliminary survey on the Lancaster Gate East Ward, and it is hoped that the staff position will improve so that this important work can go on uninterrupted until the entire borough becomes a Smoke Control Area within the course of the next ten years. Clean Air Act, 1956, Section 3.—Up to the end of 1958 twenty-nine notifications had been given under section 3 (3) of intention to instal a furnace at premises within the Borough and sixteen applications for " prior approval " were made and granted. 15 FACTORIES.—Following are tables showing the work carried out during the year in connection with the factories in the Borough.

MORTUARY.—On the 1st October, 1958, the Paddington mortuary was closed in anticipation of the development of the Hall Park area for housing purposes. An arrangement was made with the St. Pancras Borough Council for Paddington cases to be accepted in their new mortuary, and for payment to be made to that Borough 19 of an amount per body calculated by reference to the actual cost incurred in the provision and maintenance of the St. Pancras mortuary. For the quarter ended 31st December, 1958, this was £4 10s. Od. per body. The number of bodies received in the Paddington mortuary up to the 30th September, 1958, was 181 and the number taken to the St. Pancras mortuary during the rest of the year was 79.

In many premises some of the requirements of the Regulations were not being observed, but in no case was legal action found necessary to enforce them. RENT ACT, 1957.—This Act came into force on the 6th July, 1957. Below is a table showing details of the applications during 1958 for certificates of disrepair under this Act together with the action taken thereon. The figures in brackets refer to the period 6th July to 31st December, 1957. Applications for certificates of disrepair— No. of applications for certificates 71 (93) No. of decisions not to issue certificates 10 (12) No. of decisions to issue certificates— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 52 (62) (b) in respect of all defects 11(16) No. of undertakings given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule 24(31) No. of undertakings refused by Council under proviso to paragraph 5 of the First Schedule — (—) No. of certificates issued 44 (39) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year 1 (3) Applications for cancellation of certificates— Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 37 (4) Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 17 (3) Decisions by Council to cancel in spite of tenants' objections 2 (—) Certificates cancelled by Council 21 (1) No. of applications awaiting report at end of year 1 (—) MASS X-RAY SURVEYS Dr. G. Z. Brett, the Physician-in-Charge, has kindly supplied e following details of surveys carried out by Mass Radiography nit 5B in Paddington during 1958. Survey No. examined Paddington Station staff 258 Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Transport staffs (Chepstow Place establishment) 308 General Post Office staff (Winsland Street) 320 Paddington Borough Council staff 355 Paddington Cleansing Department and St. Marylebone Cleansing Department staff 196 Selfridges staff (Irongate Wharf Road building) 238 Of the 1,675 people X-rayed three were found to have active pulmonary tuberculosis and two others were recommended for observation, 22 HOUSING Housing Act, 1957—Overcrowding (a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 210 (237) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 214 (244) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 932½(1,040½) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding ported during the year 54 (35) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding lieved during the year 81 (75) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 317 (327½) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding Nil The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1958 was 210. This shows a decrease of 27 on the figure for 1957 (237). There were 66 basement dwellings on the Register. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 28 (19) were rehoused by the London County Council, 40 (30) secured accommodation privately and 13 (19) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation. The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding of premises has been abated. Section 80 of the Housing Act, 1957, gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year, the Council issued 1 (9) licences under this section of the Act. During the year, a total of 580 (769) Paddington families were rehoused by the London County Council or provided with accommodation in New Towns under the Industrial Selection Scheme. Town Planning. One hundred and eighty-four (187) applications to the London County Council under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, for the conversion and alteration of premises, change of user or continuation of consent were referred to the Council for examination and comment. Housing Enquiries. Some 22 (80) communications were received during the year from other authorities, requesting information on the housing conditions of persons applying for rehousing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions or ill-health. Such information 23 enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Public Health Inspector and a report furnished. Slum Clearance Programme. On the 4th July, 1957, the Paddington Borough Council declared an area, to be known as the Braithwaite Place and Adpar Street Area, a clearance area. The area consists of 8-11 (consec.) Adpar Street, 32-38 (even) and 7-25 and 29-35 (odd) Hall Place, 1-9 (consec.) Hall Place West, 2-13 (consec.) Braithwaite Place and 168-174 (even) Church Street. The area is approximately 1.316 acres in extent and the properties comprise 45 dwelling houses and two shops with residential upper parts (one shop being derelict). On the 6th January, 1958, the Council made the Paddington Borough Council (Braithwaite Place and Adpar Street) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1958. The order included the lands in the clearance area and about 0.693 acres of adjoining lands to be acquired. In addition the Council already own some 0.362 acres in the area. It is anticipated that about 210 families will be displaced from the clearance area and adjoining lands and the London County Council have agreed to accept responsibility for the rehousing of fifty per cent, of these. On the 17th June, 1958, the Minister of Housing and Local Government held a Public Enquiry to hear objections to the Order and at the end of the year the Minister's decision was being awaited. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation. No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 1,300 (362) No. of upper rooms closed 110 (22) No. of mews premises closed 16 (7) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders (Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953) — (—) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted — (—) One hundred and thirty-six (93) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing Orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 55 (57) basement rooms. No (3) upper rooms and no (7) mews premises had Orders determined or undertakings cancelled. Fifty-eight (46) other basement rooms but no (2) mews premises were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Of the 1,300 basement rooms, 110 upper rooms and 16 mews premises closed, 1,227 basement rooms and 107 upper rooms were in premises de-requisitioned by the Council under the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955. During the time that the rooms were under the Council's control they were considered to be unfit for housing purposes and were not used for that purpose. The closing orders were made to ensure that the position was maintained. One mews premises was also closed on de-requisition by the Council. 24 New Accommodation. During the year the Council completed fifty new flats as set out below. Wheatfield House 8 flats Clifford Court 20 flats St. Luke's Court 10 flats Aldridge Court 12 flats Housing Accommodation: Preferential Treatment. During the year 216 (167) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for " pointing." Points are awarded for certified ill-health, and if the applicant's health is affected by his living conditions the Public Health Inspector investigates the adverse conditions and in many instances is able to get them remedied. Land Charges Act, 1925. This Act provides for the maintenance of a Register of Local Land Charges in which are registered statutory charges including closing and demolition orders made by the Council under the Housing Acts. Solicitors and others making a search in this Register almost invariably submit supplementary questions about various matters of concern to the Public Health Department. These include slum clearance areas, statutory notices under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and the Housing Acts, certificates of disrepair under the Rent Act, 1957, and the implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, in the Borough. Some 1,769 (1,530) enquiries on these matters received the attention of the Department during the year. SAFETY IN THE HOME.—Towards the end of 1957 matters relating to safety in the home were referred to the Public Health Committee. During 1958 pamphlets were distributed and posters exhibited drawing attention to the more common causes of accidents in the home and there was a Home Safety Campaign week in November for the public generally. Earlier in the year however leaflets were issued through Post Offices and by organisations such as the Women's Voluntary Services drawing the attention of old people in particular to dangers in the home. The North Thames Gas Board were also supplied with the names and addresses of about 350 elderly people from the department's records and these were visited by Gas Board officials who arranged if necessary for adjustments to be made to meters, gas taps and connections with a view to minimising the risk of accidents. The Public Health Department also keeps a small supply of fireguards and these are loaned to old people without charge on the recommendation of the Visitors. Both the Visitors and the Public Health Inspectors take the opportunities afforded by their work to make the public more home safety conscious by personal advice. 25 LEGISLATION Artificial Lighting of Common Staircases.—Ministerial approval was received to byelaws made by the Council under Sec. 63 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1956. These byelaws provide for the adequate artificial lighting of any common staircase in tenement houses or flats and came into operation on the 1st April, 1958. Drainage Work.—Section 30 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, enabled the Council to execute drainage work by agreement with the owners of premises in cases where the Council require such work. The Public Health Committee decided to charge interest when the repayment is by instalments and at present this is 5| per cent., subject to review in any particular case of an exceptional nature. CONTRIBUTIONS TO ORGANISATIONS.—Among the Organisations to which the Council make grants the following are closely connected with the work of the Public Health Department. Amount Organisation of Grant £ s. d. Family Welfare Association (Area 2) 100 0 0 Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee 825 0 0 Women's Voluntary Services (for meals-on-wheels service) 260 0 0 Salvation Army (for meals-on-wheels service) 50 0 0 Kensington and Paddington Family Service Unit 150 0 0 Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents 14 14 0 Central Council for Health Education 11 11 0 The Central Council for Health Education produces excellent pamphlets on subjects which are essential to public health such as food hygiene and the prevention of disease. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents covers a wide field but its Home Safety work is of most interest to the Department. The ageing population continues to make increasing demands on the Old People's Welfare Committee and the meals-on-wheels services. The Family Welfare Association, amongst other bodies, help with social difficulties which come to our notice; and the Family Service Unit by its work in dealing with families and their problems as a whole save the taxpayer an amount far exceeding the subscriptions to the Unit. CARE OF THE AGED Holiday Home.—Following are figures showing the guests accommodated during the year at " Kincardine." Guests stay for a fortnight during January, February and March and for a week during the remainder of the year. Number of applications received 873 Number of guests accommodated ,, ,, 591 26 Number of applicants refusing or unable to accept the holiday offered for the reasons given. (a) Date offered being too early or too late 86 (b) Private reasons 106 (c) Illness 61 (d) Death 21 Number of applicants not offered a holiday for the reasons given. (а) Removed from Borough 2 (б) Died 5 (c) Refused by Selection Committee 1 Of the 591 guests accommodated as shown above, 116 were having their first holiday at the Home. The Home was again open for a week at Christmas and a further sixteen guests (the maximum which can be catered for) were selected from forty-six applicants for this period. National Assistance Acts.—It was found necessary to apply to the Court for one compulsory removal order during the year. The patient (a man aged 76 years) was removed to a local general hospital and subsequently admitted to a mental institution. Home Bathing and Laundry Service.—Five hundred and sixty-nine (601) baths were given at home to forty-two persons during the year and the number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year by the laundry service was nine (10). Thirty-one (29) people received help from the laundry service during the year. General.—At the end of the year there were 135 (145) names on the register of old people maintained in the Department for regular visiting. In addition 135 other old people were visited but it was not found necessary to put them on the register. The female visitors made 1,575 (1,211) visits, and the male inspectors 50 (30) visits to old people during the year. 27 APPENDIX Report of the Public Analyst (C. Harcourt Wordsworth, B.Sc., F.R.I.C.S) for the year ended 31st December, 1958. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, During the year 1958, six hundred samples were purchased by your Inspectors for examination under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, twenty being taken formally and five hundred and eighty informally. A total of twenty-nine samples were reported as being either adulterated, irregular or abnormal. A summary of the number and types of samples is given below:— Formal Informal Total Drugs — 17 17 Meat and Meat Products — 39 39 Milk 20 255 275 Other Articles — 269 269 20 580 600 Nine of the samples of milk examined were found not to conform with the presumptive standards of composition for genuine milk but in each case the Hortvet Freezing Point showed that water had not been added and the samples were reported as abnormal. A sample of baking powder was shown to be deficient in carbon dioxide. The composition of this product is governed by a Food Standard and the efficacy of the article depends on the amount of carbon dioxide released when the powder is moistened. Samples packed in cardboard or paper frequently lose strength. A tin of Zinc and Castor Oil Cream was found to contain an excess of zinc oxide which was probably caused by poor mixing. A sample of orangeade was found to have a faulty label in that no trade mark or maker's name and address was disclosed. Two other soft drinks were submitted in connection with a complaint and although one was found to have an unpleasant smell nothing toxic was found in either. During the year some consignments of foreign apples were found to have been imported into this country containing residues from toxic sprays. Two samples submitted were found to contain excessive amounts of lead and arsenic and it was suggested that the fruit should be scrubbed before being eaten to remove all visible traces of spray residue. A sample of butter received following a complaint was found to contain a slight excess of water but was otherwise normal. 28 A complaint was received concerning foreign matter in bread and examination showed that the material was a small piece of general dirt and grease which might have come from a greased part of the machinery. A sample of ready cooked oats was examined and found to contain a mixture of sand and glass fragments. Some of the fragments were coloured and fused and this was perhaps one of the most unusual foreign bodies to be found in food during the year. Yet another sample of oats was found to have a smell of soap but otherwise was satisfactory. Another type of breakfast food examined was found to be infested with the larvae of a moth, and a sample submitted as a control was also found to be infested and the stock of the shop was dealt with accordingly. A sample of minced meat was found to contain sulphite preservative. Such addition is prohibited by regulation and the sample was reported against. Although not strictly within the Food and Drugs Act samples are checked for weight and in one case a sample of prepacked currants was found to be under weight. Bottles of milk were again submitted for examination following complaints of deposits and contamination. In one instance paint was found, in another a growth of algae showed that the washing process was at fault whilst a third sample was found to contain a gelatinous mass derived from the protein of the milk by the action of organisms. Although unsightly it was not considered harmful. Other samples calling for comment included fermenting tomato juice cocktail and whole rice of a rather unusual brown colour. A few samples were found to have labels which, although not misleading, were considered to be ambiguous and attention was drawn to these in the reports This report will, it is hoped, give some brief indication of the variety of foods and drugs examined in the Borough and although the faulty samples are naturally the most interesting, it should be pointed out that the majority of the articles analysed are quite satisfactory. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. Harcourt Wordsworth, Public Analyst. vail and co. ltd., leeke street, w.c.i.
