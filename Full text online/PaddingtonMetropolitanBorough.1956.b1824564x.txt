Vital Statistics Analysis of the causes of death shew that Coronary disease (212 deaths) continues to be the greatest killer. Unhappily malignant disease of the lung and bronchus continues to increase, and was responsible for no less than 68 deaths in the year, 80 per cent. of which were males. Conversely, only 15 deaths were attributed to Pulmonary Tuberculosis as compared with 100 deaths only ten years ago. Accidents accounted for 62 deaths, most of which were in the home and 17 as a result of motor vehicles. In addition there were no less than 26 suicides during the year. Food and Drugs Act, 1955 and Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 The Food and Drugs Act 1955 together with the Food Hygiene Regulations made under the Act came into force during the year. Detailed reference to these important and far reaching public health measures are made in the body of the report. Basement Rooms It will be noted that 270 basement rooms were closed during the year as compared to 35 in the previous year. This was occasioned entirely by official closing orders being placed on basements of de-requisitioned property which had not been in occupation for many years. What, in my opinion, is of greater import is that, as the result of the negotiations and persuasions of your Public Health Inspectors, over 70 basement rooms were made habitable by their owners. Clean Air Act, 1956 This Act, which makes provision for abating the pollution of the air is considered in detail in the body of the report. The Minister of Housing and Local Government fixed the appointed day for the coming into operation of the Clean Air Act (except for certain sections) as the 31st December, 1956. Further reference as to the action taken by this department as a consequence of the passing of this Act will be given in my report next year. 3 Poliomyelitis Vaccination During the year sufficient vaccine had been received by the London County Council Divisional Medical Officer to immunise over 400 Paddington children against Poliomyelitis. Next year, when larger supplies of vaccine become available, very many more children in Paddington will be rendered immune to this dread disease. The Public Health Inspectors are four below establishment. This necessarily has had its consequential repercussion on the work of the Department. In conclusion, I express my gratitude for the help and cooperation I have received from the Public Health Committee, the Chief Officers of the Council, and especially to all the staff of the Public Health Department. Staff I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health. 4 5 PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE (at 31st December, 1956).— Clr. Mrs. E. G.

Public Health (London) Act, 1936:— Anthrax Membranous croup Cholera Relapsing Fever Diphtheria Scarlet Fever Enteric Fever Smallpox Erysipelas Typhoid Fever Glanders Typhus Fever Hydrophobia Public Health Regulations:— Dysentery Pneumonia Acute Encephalitis (primary and influenzal) Leprosy Poliomyelitis Malaria Tuberculosis Meningococcal infection Puerperal pyrexia Ophthalmia neonatorum Local Government Order:— County of London Regulations:— Plague Measles Food and Drugs Act:— Scabies Food poisoning Whooping cough Bacteriological examinations.—The number of examinations made in connection with infectious disease was 351 (218) most of which were in respect of outbreaks of food poisoning. Routine examinations were also made of the water from the Council's swimming baths. Visiting.—Puerperal pyrexia, Tuberculosis, Ophthalmia Neonatorum and Infective Enteritis cases are visited by the London County Council's Health Visitors. Smallpox case enquiries are made by the male Public Health Inspectors and food poisoning investigations by the Food Inspectors. Cases of other diseases and associated enquiries are made by the Borough Council's women Visitors who made 1,189 (2,414) calls in connection with this work. International certificates.—During the year 1,718 (1,740) certificates of inoculation or vaccination were submitted for the authentication of the signature of the medical practitioner concerned. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Notifications.—Following is a table showing the numbers of cases of infectious disease notified. The number of cases after allowing for corrections of diagnosis is shown in brackets. 11 Notifications.—Following is a table showing the numbers of cases of infectious disease notified.

The present policy of the Unit is to cover the territory as frequently as possible, X-raying firms and offices as near as possible to their doorstep ... It has now been found practical for the Unit to move three or four times a day comfortably and X-ray 300 people: twice a day and X-ray 450, and once a day and X-ray 540 . . . The mobile Mass X-ray Unit is purely a diagnostic centre for non-symptomatic individuals. The mobile mass X-ray Unit should concentrate on those groups of people who would not, or could not, easily avail themselves of any other form of free chest X-ray . . . Very little time was spent by the Unit in Paddington during the year, except for special request surveys. It is proposed to try and cover this area much more extensively during the next year: with special reference to some open general public sessions which have not been previously held in the borough." During the year 1955, 4,012 persons were X-rayed in Paddington. The analysis of significant tuberculosis discovered was as follows:— Active tuberculosis 3 Occasional supervision 9 During 1956, 4,326 people were X-rayed.

The Council's attention was drawn to the possible dangers to public health from increased exhaust fumes from any additional diesel engined omnibuses which the London Transport Executive were proposing to operate in their programme for full scale replacement of trolley-buses to commence in 1958. The Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee sought the Council's observations on this possible additional pollution in view of the debate which was then taking place in Parliament on the Clean Air Bill. The Council on the 26th January, 1956 informed the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee that they fully concurred in the proposal to reconsider the general question of air pollution by diesel engined vehicles and, in the light of certain enquiries in connection with lung cancer, recommended that the attention of the London Transport Executive be drawn to the fact that the introduction of additional diesel engined omnibuses may 17 well prove detrimental to the health of the general public. In view of the concensus of opinion in favour, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee agreed to support the invitation to invite the London Transport Executive to reconsider their decision to introduce additional diesel engined omnibuses and also to urge Government Departments to consider the need for research to be made into the whole question of air pollution by both diesel and petrol engined vehicles. The Minister of Housing and Local Government fixed the appointed day for the operation of the Clean Air Act, 1956 for the 31st December, 1956 with the exception of certain provisions of that Act, the principal of which are as follows:— Section Subject 1 Prohibition of dark smoke from chimneys. 2 Temporary exemptions from Section 1. 5 Requirement that grit and dust from furnaces shall be minimised. 6 Requirement that new furnaces shall be fitted with plant to arrest grit and dust. 7 Require measurements of grit and dust emitted from furnaces. 8 Information about furnace and fuel consumption. 9 Similar information as required under Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 in respect of outdoor furnaces, etc. Section 2 of the Clean Air Act", the appointed day for which the Minister has yet to fix, states it shall be a defence to prove (a) that contravention of Section 1 was due to the nature of the building or its equipment and was not due to any failure properly to maintain the building or properly to maintain and use the equipment of the building; and (b) that it had not been practicable to alter or equip the building so as to enable it to be used or fully used for the purpose for which it was intended without the likelihood of contravening the provisions of Section 1. Section 3 (1) of the Act requires that no furnace shall be installed in a building or in any boiler or industrial plant attached to a building or for the time being fixed to or installed on any land unless it is so far as practicable, capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of a type for which the furnace was designed and any person who instals a furnace in contravention of this subsection or on whose instructions a furnace is so installed shall be guilty of an offence provided that this subsection shall not apply to a furnace the installation of which had begun or an agreement for the purchase or installation of which had been entered into before the appointed day. Further any furnace installed in accordance with plans and specifications submitted to and approved for the purposes of this Section by the local authority shall be deemed to have complied with the provisions of subsection (1) of this Section. 18 19 It is further laid down that a furnace to which Section 3 (1) applies shall not be installed in a building or in any such boiler or plant as is mentioned in subsection (1) unless notice of the proposal to instal it has been given to the local authority and any person who fails to give such notice shall be guilty of an offence. This Section does not apply to furnaces designed solely or mainly for use for domestic purposes, not being furnaces of boilers with a maximum heating capacity of 55,000 or more British thermal units per hour. Section 3 of the Act is of importance as this is the Section whereby the local authority can take action where contraventions are committed and where plans and specifications can be submitted for approval, such approval when given signifying that the installation complies with the provisions of subsection (1) of Section 3 of the Act. Close liaison with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor has been arranged so that the Public Health Department can be advised promptly of new buildings where furnaces are to be installed which will enable my Public Health Smoke Inspector to give every possible assistance. The provisions of this Act are to some extent based on a long term policy in view of the necessity, maybe, for the conversion of plant which cannot be operated satisfactorily to comply therewith ; but I shall be in a better position to report more fully on the administration of the provisions now in force in my next annual report.

The Borough in which the employing firm had their premises was asked to take the matter up and the work was stopped.

In addition to the above, 36(17) summonses were withdrawn; and 54(15) guineas costs were received in connection therewith. SHOPS ACTS.—The Shops Acts Inspectors made 1,856 (1,500) inspections during the year. No statutory action was necessary, any contraventions found being dealt with informally. PET ANIMALS ACT.—Six (6) licences were applied for and granted during the year. Routine inspections are made to ensure that the conditions attaching to the licences are being maintained. BURIALS.—During the year 44 (45) burials and 2(—) cremations were arranged under the National Assistance Act, 1948. MORTUARY.—The number of bodies received at the mortuary was 258(379) and 237(319) post mortem examinations were made there. The decrease is due to the practice, since April, of holding post mortem examinations at hospitals in cases where patients have died in hospital. 23 CANAL BOATS.—During the year the Paddington Basin and its vicinity were visited on a number of occasions and ten boats were inspected. It was not found necessary to serve any formal notices. Only one child of school age was found to be living on the boats inspected. RODENT CONTROL.—The following table gives details of the work carried out under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 and at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, relates to the year ended 31st March, 1957. Dwelling Houses All other property Total Total number of properties in district 31,444 (24,685) 7,803 (4,737) 39,247 (29,422) Number of properties inspected as a result of— (a) Notifications 516 (528) 100 (101) 616 (629) (b) Otherwise 164 (156) 29 (36) 193 (192) Number of properties found to be infested by rats— (a) Major infestation 2 (1) - (-) 2 (1) (b) Minor infestation 207 (210) 38 (50) 245 (260) Number of properties found to be infested by mice 249 (234) 58 (48) 307 (282) Number of infested properties treated by Council 451 (440) 95 (97) 546 (537) It was not found necessary to serve any notices. Two (4) "block control" schemes were carried out. The variation in the number of properties is due to the revaluation of the Borough. Sewer Treatment:— During the year the normal treatments of the sewers were carried out in January and June. While it is not suggested that rats will be completely eradicated from sewers, these twice yearly treatments do prevent an increase in the rat population and, to a limited extent, reduce it. A measure of the success of the treatments is the fact that the filtering screens at the pumping stations have to be cleared of rat carcasses during and immediately after sewer treatments. It follows, therefore, that sewer treatments can never eliminate surface infestations. One litter of rats born near a disused or defective drain can cause a serious surface infestation. Unfortunately, as far as Paddington is concerned, there are many old. disused and defective drains which the rats may use and constant surveillance and treatment by the Council's Rodent staff is required to keep infestations under control. 24 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act:— The charge for the services rendered under the provisions of this Act was increased from 6/3d. to 7/6d. per man hour to meet the additional cost of labour and materials which has arisen since the 1st April, 1954, when the charge for this service was last reviewed. PIGEONS.—No complaint about pigeons was received during the year. RAG FLOCK ACT.—Four (4) premises where filling material was being used were on the register at the end of the year. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock is manufactured or stored. Two (7) samples were taken, both of which were satisfactory. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACTS.—At the end of the year the register contained the names of 111 (115) persons entitled to sell the poisons scheduled in Part II of the Poisons List. DRAINAGE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS.—During the year 189 (225) plans were deposited for drainage work in existing buildings. Prosecutions in connection with drainage work are reported under " Legal Proceedings ". COMMON LODGING HOUSES.—There is one common lodging house in the Borough which provides sixty-six beds for women. WATER SUPPLY.—All drinking water in the Borough is supplied from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains and has been satisfactory. Two (2) water supply certificates were issued under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT.—The following table gives details of the applications made under this Act. At the request of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, it relates to the year ended 31st March, 1957. Dwelling houses which have been the subject of a notice under Part II of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Dwelling houses which have been the subject of a notice under the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920 No. of applications for certificates 11 (20) 2 (6) No. granted 6 (13) 2 (4) No. refused 5 (7) - (2) No. of applications for revocations of certificates 10 (25) 4 (-) No. granted 8 (21) 1 (—) No. refused 2 (4) 3 (-) 25 In my annual report for last year, the Council were informed that the effect of the repeal of the bye-laws made under Section 6 of the Housing Act, 1936 was being kept under constant review, and that already the bye-law requiring the lighting of common staircases was being resuscitated in a London County Council (General Powers) Bill. The London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1956, has since been enacted. Section 63 of which empowers the Borough Council to make bye-laws with respect to tenement houses and flats for the adequate artificial lighting of any common staircase in such premises. Loss of the Council's powers suffered by the repeal of the London County Council bye-laws, and the attendant complications of invoking Section 11 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, has continued to be a problem. As a consequence, representations were made by the Council, through the medium of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, that this Council was of the opinion that the powers to enforce cleaning of rooms in tenement houses should be replaced. Arising from the Council's representations, the London County Council subsequently suggested that, whilst reviewing such powers relating to the periodical cleaning of common parts of tenement dwellings, it might be worthwhile to consider other repealed powers. The repeal of the bye-laws in question has no doubt been a handicap to the work of the Public Health Inspectors, as Section 11 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act did not, in my view, answer the same purpose as the bye-laws which when in force enabled many defects to be remedied to the satisfaction of the tenants and to the' general wellbeing of that section of the public living in the type of houses covered by the bye-laws. It was therefore very heartening that the Council had a further opportunity of pressing for the re-introduction of the lost powers through the medium of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, and that the Council on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee submitted the following bye-laws to the London County Council recommending their replacement: Bye-law No. Subject 13. (a) Efficient means for carrying off any waste water from every tap from which water may be drawn. 14. (a) Cleansing yard, area, staircase, landing, etc., used in common. (b) Provision of bedding, etc., in a clean and some condition. (c) Not let any room unless the room and the fittings and appliances therein are clean and free from vermin. (d) Maintain in good order, etc., every receptacle for dust and refuse used in common. (e) Keep in order and repair all window cords and fittings. 26 15. Every lodger in a lodging-house shall:— (a) At least once in every day remove or cause to be removed all filth and refuse from every room which has been let to him and thoroughly cleanse or cause to be cleansed every receptacle belonging to him or to the exclusive use of which he is entitled which has been used for filth or refuse. (b) Keep thoroughly clean and wholesome every yard, area, staircase, landing, passage, water-closet, sink and bath to the exclusive use of which he is entitled, and every receptacle to the exclusive use to which he is entitled, provided for the deposit of dust, ashes or house refuse. (c) Keep thoroughly clean every window, fixture or fitting, the interior surface of every wall and all paintwork in every room let to him. (d) Keep thoroughly clean and wholesome and free from vermin, all the contents of every room let to him including the beds, bedclothes and bedding belonging to and used by him or any member of his family. (e) Keep thoroughly clean and wholesome and free from vermin the floor of every room let to him. 16. A lodger in a lodging house shall not:— (a) Keep or permit to be kept any animal in any room let to him or elsewhere upon the premises in such manner as to render the room or premises filthy or unwholesome. (b) Deposit or cause or knowingly permit to be deposited by any member of his family any filth or liquid refuse in any receptacle provided for the deposit of dust, ashes or house refuse to be removed by the Council. (c) Deposit or permit to be deposited any filth or refuse upon any fixture or part of the premises which he is entitled to use in conjunction with other persons. 20/21. Prevention of and safety from fire. (Advisability of re-introduction by the London County Council.) 25. Provision of handrails where necessary for all staircases. I am confident that much good will result when these bye-laws are re-introduced, and moreover by the improvement of the living conditions in the properties concerned, the public generally will benefit thereby. Due to the scarcity of new accommodation, the preservation of the existing accommodation in a reasonable state of repair is more than ever necessary at this time. BAKEHOUSES.—At the end of the year there were 18 (16) "Level" and 1 (2) "underground " bakehouses in operation. One underground bakehouse was out of use temporarily. 27 CARE OF THE AGED.—In my last annual report I emphasised the need for continued publicity for the purpose of avoiding accidents in the home. A simply worded leaflet comprising information of the services available, and how to apply for them, as well as advice on how to prevent danger to health and limb, was distributed through the post offices. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all those who so willingly co-operated and thus ensured a wide circulation of this leaflet to the old folk in Paddington. There were 168 (159) current cases on the records of the Department at the end of the year. One hundred (100) cases were brought to notice during 1956. The women visitors made 1,257 (1,302) visits and male inspectors 61 (66) visits during the year. National Assistance Acts.—It was unhappily found necessary to apply to the Court for a compulsory removal order in respect of one aged and infirm person during the year. The lady concerned was taken into Paddington General Hospital, and subsequently admitted to Horton Hospital, where she died. Her husband agreed, at the time of his wife's removal, to enter a London County Council Institution and is still in good health. Holiday Home.—During the year 937(962) applications for holidays were received and 613(654) guests were accommodated. Two hundred and eighty-eight applicants refused the holiday offered (mainly on account of illness or because the dates allocated were too early or too late). In the remaining 36 cases no allocation was made due to death, removal from the Borough, unfitness or to single rooms or specific dates not being available. Home bathing and laundry service.—I am pleased to report that by re-organisation of staff due to the low incidence of scabies, etc. I have been able to arrange for the female medicinal baths attendant to concentrate more fully on home bathing. Four hundred and forty-two (359) baths were given during the year. This is a service very much appreciated by the old folk, and I am optimistic that this service will extend to many who heretofore we have been unable to help. Close liaison is maintained with the Home Help service administered by the London County Council through their Divisional Office, and I feel that the increased assistance we are now able to offer will contribute to the well being of the aged. The laundry service continues to function satisfactorily, and with the co-operation of the District Nursing Association deserving cases are helped. The number of cases being dealt with at the end of the year was nine (9). Twenty-five (10) people received help from this service during the year. Finally I would emphasise the loneliness suffered by many of the old folk. Mrs. Thomas, the Organiser of the Paddington Old People's Welfare Committee, has obtained the services of several volunteers who visit regularly some of the old people in their homes, but this voluntary organisation is most anxious to enlist the help of more helpers for this all important work. 28 FOOD SUPERVISION.— Unsound food.—Approximately 8½ (13½) tons of diseased or unsound food were surrendered for destruction. Diseased meat is incinerated, and other condemned food disposed of through the normal refuse channels. Bacteriological examinations.—The samples of milk submitted, 95 (100) were all satisfactory. Samples of ice cream examined under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations were graded as follows: — Grade 1—11 (10) : Grade 3—3 (6) Grade 2— 8 (9) : Grade 4—2 (8) Registrations.—The following registrations were in force at the end of the year under the Milk and Dairies Regulations or the Food and Drugs Acts: — Distributors of milk 127 (124) Dairies 1 (—) Ice cream premises 199 (198) Food premises 72 (75) Licences.—Licences to sell designated milk in force at the end of the year are given below:— Dealers' principal licences Dealers' supplementary licences Pasteurised 108 (90) Pasteurised 24 (24) Sterilised 122 (123) Sterilised 27 (28) Tuberculin tested 85 (67) Tuberculin tested 23 (24) Inspections:—During the year the two Food Inspectors paid 1,040 (720) visits to restaurants and cafes and 4,634 (5,402) visits to other food shops. Food premises:—Following are details of the food premises in the Borough at the end of the year:— Food shops:— Bakers 19 (20) Provision stores 124 (123) Cake shops 20 (23) Horsemeat shops 1 (2) Butchers 62 (61) Domestic stores 20 (20) Confectioners 148 (145) Corn chandlers 2 (2) Chemists 46 (48) Greengrocers 85 (86) Fishmongers 22 (22) Public houses 106 (106) Fried fish shops 11 (11) Cider houses 2 (2) Grocers 44 (45) Off licences 57 (57) General shops 36 (41) Restaurants, cafes 136 (137) Food factories:—There are 10 (9) food factories in the Borough including 2 (2) ice cream factories. Street traders:—Coffee stalls 6 (6); fruit and vegetable stalls 25 (28); ice cream stalls 2 (2). Sampling.—During the year 600 (600) samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, and appropriate action taken in respect of the informal samples incorrectly labelled or "adulterated". From the 1st May, 1956 the cost of samples examined, payable by the Council to the Public Analyst, was increased from one guinea to £1 8s. 0d. per sample of milk and from £1 15s. 0d. to £2 10s. 0d. for other samples. 29 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, came into operation on the 1st January, 1956 and introduced important changes in the law. Under this Act the Minister of Health, acting jointly with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has made the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, which modify and extend the hygiene requirements hitherto covered by Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938. The majority of the Regulations came into force on the 1st January, 1956, but certain of the provisions, which involve alterations to premises and equipment or substantial changes in established trade practices, were not enforceable until the 1st July, 1956. The Regulations deal with the structural condition of food premises, stalls and vehicles, the construction and cleanliness of articles and equipment with which food may come into contact, and the hygiene of food handlers themselves while they are handling or preparing food. They apply to clubs, schools, hospitals and institutions, staff canteens, and all other premises where food is handled. In respect of contravention of these Regulations, courts will be able to impose maximum penalties of £100 fine or three months' imprisonment, or both, with £5 for each day the offence continues after conviction. It is prohibited under the Regulations to carry on a food business in insanitary premises, stalls, or places where food is exposed to risk of contamination. Restriction is placed on the preparation and packing of food for commercial purposes in domestic premises. It is necessary for sinks and washbasins to be provided in food premises with a constant supply of hot water if reasonably practicable. There must also be some provision for hot water on stalls supplying food for immediate consumption. In both cases some exceptions may be made. Articles and equipment with which food may come into contact are to be so constructed and maintained that they can be thoroughly cleaned. Food handlers are required to keep all parts of their person or clothing, including overalls, as clean as may be reasonably practicable. Any open cut or abrasion must be kept covered with a suitable waterproof dressing. Smoking or the use of tobacco while handling unwrapped food is prohibited and spitting is forbidden. The Regulations prohibit the use of newspaper for wrapping food, other than uncooked vegetables, except as an outer wrapper. Certain foods on catering premises, notably made-up dishes and precooked foods, which provide a good medium for the transmission of disease organisms, must not be kept at the lukewarm temperature at which bacterial multiplication is greatest. Local authorities are authorised to grant certificates of exemption in certain cases where compliance cannot reasonably be required because of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances. An appeal may be made to magistrates against the refusal or withdrawal of a certificate. 30 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. On the passing of this Act in December, 1955, certain welcome legislation was introduced dealing with (a) Stopped up or defective drains, etc; (b) Re-instatement of water supply when cut off; and (c) Remedying of defective premises. With regard to (a) a notice can now be served upon the owner or occupier of the premises in respect of a stopped up drain, water closet or soil pipe, to remedy the defect within forty-eight hours from the service of the notice and if not complied with the Borough Council may themselves carry out the works necessary to remedy the defect and may recover the expenses incurred from the person upon whom the notice was served. In the case of a defective drain discovered following an inspection under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the cost of remedying which, in the opinion of the Council, would not exceed £100, the Borough Council may (in lieu of serving the required notice under Section 40), after giving not less than seven days' notice to the owner and occupier of the premises concerned, carry out such works and recover from such owner or occupier the expenses incurred so far as they do not exceed £100. Furthermore, where in any case the expenses incurred by the Borough Council in any of the provisions of the Section do not exceed £2 the Borough Council may if they think fit remit the payment thereof. With regard to (b) under the provisions of Section 26 of this Act, in cases where the Metropolitan Water Board by reason of the defective state of a supply pipe, etc., ceases to supply with water any building or part of a building occupied for human habitation or as a place where persons are employed, the Borough Council may, after giving notice to the owner of their intention so to do. execute such works, etc., as they may consider necessary to secure that the supply of water is re-instated and the expenses reasonably incurred in so doing are recoverable from the owner of the building or part of the building. With regard to (c) under the provisions of Section 27, where the Council are satisfied that any house is in such a state as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health and having regard to all the circumstances, unreasonable delay in remedying the defective state would be occasioned by following the procedure prescribed under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, instead of serving a Nuisance Notice, the Borough Council may serve upon the person responsible a notice to the effect that the Council themselves intend to remedy the defective state of the premises and such notice shall specify the defects which they intend to remedy. Subject to certain provisos, at any time after the expiration of nine days after the service of such notice, the Council may execute such works as may be necessary to remedy the defects referred to in the notice ; and subject to any appeal as to the justification of the action taken ; that the alleged defective state did not exist at the time of the service of the notice: or the urgency was not so great as to warrant the action taken, etc., may recover the expenses reasonably incurred from the person upon whom the notice was served. 31 HYGIENE IN BARBERS AND HAIRDRESSERS SHOPS:— London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 (Section 18) In my last annual report I reported that there were 83 hairdressers and barbers establishments in the Borough and that the appointed day for registration had been fixed for the 1st January, 1956. Arrangements for registration were completed satisfactorily early in the year, and at the 31st December, the establishments registered with the Council numbered 87. Inspections were made at the time of registration and so far as the present establishment of Public Health Inspectors will allow, periodical inspections are carried out.

(a) (1) Number of dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 277 (297) (2) Number of families dwelling therein 293 (302) (3) Number of persons dwelling therein 1,192 (1,236$) (Units) (b) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 73 (100) (c) (1) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 93 (91) (2) Number of persons concerned in such cases 368 (375$) (Units) (d) Particulars of any cases in which dwelling- houses have again become overcrowded after the Local Authority have taken steps for the abatement of overcrowding NIL The number of overcrowded dwellings on the Register of Overcrowding at the end of 1956 (277) shows a decrease of 20 on the figure for 1955 (297); 95 of these were basement dwellings. Of the cases of overcrowding relieved during the year, 2 (12) were provided with accommodation by the Borough Council, 7 (16) were rehoused by the London County Council, 54 (36) secured accommodation privately, 26 (23) were relieved by a natural reduction in the size of the family or on obtaining additional accommodation, and 4 (4) families were rehoused under the Industrial Selection Scheme for New Towns. The practice of sending warning letters to owners and landlords against permitting the premises to become again overcrowded has been continued in all known cases where overcrowding of premises has been abated. Section 61 of the Housing Act, 1936, gives a local authority power, where they are satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist which make it expedient to do so, to allow the temporary use of a house by persons in excess of the permitted number. During the year, the Council issued 8 (9) licences under this section of the Act. During the year, a total of 291 (292) families from Paddington were rehoused on London County Council Estates or provided with accommodation in New Towns under the Industrial Selection Scheme. Housing Act, 1949—Improvements and Conversions. Twenty-seven (nineteen) applications for grants in respect of proposed improvement or conversion of properties were referred to the Department for examination and report. The preparation of these reports involves consultation between the Public Health Inspectors and other technical officers of the Council, as well as interviews on the premises with the architects and owners concerned. 34 Town Planning. Two hundred and twenty-nine (two hundred and eight) applications to the London County Council under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, for the conversion and alteration of premises, change of user and continuation of consent were referred to the Council for examination and comment. As a result of the Council's observations, permission was refused for certain basement rooms to be used for human habitation where the rooms did not conform to the statutes and regulations in force in the Borough. Housing Accommodation: Preferential Treatment. During the year 274 (490) medical certificates were referred to me by the Borough Director of Housing for "pointing". This arrangement enables the necessary degree of preference to be given to each certificate as well as bringing to notice sanitary defects which might otherwise have escaped detection and in respect of which no previous complaint had been received. Land Charges Act, 1925. Under the above-mentioned Act it is incumbent on the local authority to keep a register of local land charges. Houses included in clearance, improvement and redevelopment areas must be registered, as well as houses subject to repair notices under Part II of the Housing Act, 1936, and houses on which closing or demolition orders have been made. Some 1,305 (1,514) enquiries were referred to the Public Health Department during the year asking for details of notices outstanding and orders in operation under the Housing Act. At the same time particulars were called for of sanitary or other notices outstanding on the properties concerned. Housing Enquiries. Some 200 (350) communications were received during the year from the Borough Director of Housing, the County Divisional Medical Officer, the County Director of Housing and from other authorities, requesting information on the housing conditions of persons applying for rehousing on grounds of overcrowding, insanitary conditions and ill-health. Such information enables the enquirer to assess the degree of priority to be given to the applicants concerned. In each case a visit was made by the Public Health Inspector and a report furnished. New Accommodation. During the year 82 flats were completed at Hallfield, and 24 at Sutherland Court, Marylands Road. The following is a list of Council-owned new accommodation :— Pre-war No. of flats Post-war No. of flats Brindley House 8 Fleming Court 48 Dudley House 50 Queen's Park Court 96 Artesian House 8 John Aird Court 228 35 Post-war—contd.

One notice (15) was served and complied with during the year under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936. Of the thirteen (14) notices served prior to 1956 which remained outstanding, the owners complied with three (8) and in seven (4) other cases the work was completed by the Council in default. Responsibility for compliance with three other notices was assumed by the London County Council. Slum Clearance Programme. On the 21st April, 1956, the Minister of Housing and Local Government approved the joint proposals made by the Borough Council and the London County Council under Section I of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. An approved copy of the proposals was duly placed on deposit at the Town Hall for inspection. These proposals provide for 279 unfit houses to be dealt with by the London County Council and for the Borough Council to deal with 54 unfit houses during the period 1956-1960. In addition, the Borough Council will give consideration to dealing with a further 83 unfit houses already covered by operative clearance or compulsory purchase orders and 6 individual unfit houses as and when decanting facilities become available. In addition to the Edensor Gardens and North Wharf Road Clearance Areas declared by the London County Council in 1955, the County Council have this year declared the Brindley Road Area to be a clearance area under Section 25 of the Housing Act, 1936, and have decided to acquire the areas for the purposes of Part III of the Housing Act, 1936, as amended, together with additional lands which in the opinion of the County Council are reasonably necessary for the satisfactory development or user of the areas. The Compulsory Purchase Order has been submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. Public Local Enquiries into the London County Council's Edensor Gardens and North Wharf Road Clearance Areas are to be held at the Town Hall early in the New Year. On the 18th April, 1956, the London County Council made a compulsory purchase order entitled The County of London (Clarendon Crescent, Paddington) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1956, authorising it to purchase compulsorily for the purpose of providing housing accommodation in accordance with Part V of the Housing Act, 1936, as amended by the Housing Act, 1949. the land described in the schedule attached thereto. Included in the schedule are certain lands in Harrow Road, Clarendon Crescent, Woodchester Street, Cirencester Street, Desborough Street, Oliver Mews, Dartington Terrace, Senior Street, Hasborough Street, Statham Street, Philip Terrace, Bourne Terrace, Westbury Terrace, Westbourne Park Crescent, Westbury Road, Lord Hills Road, Delamere Crescent, Delamere Terrace, Chichester Road and Chichester Place. The Compulsory Purchase Order has been submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. Fumigation. Associated Fumigators Limited, under an agreement with the Council, removed and treated the furniture and effects of 49 (51) families with hydrogen cyanide gas during the year. The cost of the work was £337 (£315). Up to the 31st May, 1956, the charge for this work was £10 10s. per van per day, towards which the person removed contributed £5 5s. Owing to increased operating costs the Contractors, as from the 1st June, 1956, increased their charge to £12 10s. per day in cases where two removals are effected in one van, and as from that date the change made by the Council to persons whose furniture and effects are dealt with under the terms of the Agreement was increased to £6 5s. Houses Unfit for Human Habitation. No. of basement rooms dealt with by closing orders 270 (35) No. of houses dealt with by closing orders (Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953) 4 (1) No. of houses dealt with by demolition orders or in respect of which undertakings were accepted — (—) Twelve (—) persons were displaced as a result of the Council's operations. Closing orders were determined or undertakings cancelled on 28 (30) basement rooms: and 43 (28) other basement rooms and two whole premises were made fit without recourse to formal proceedings. Closed premises. During the year the Public Health Inspectors carried out a survey of closed basements and upper parts of premises. Eight hundred and fifty-six premises were visited and 71 contraventions of the closing orders in operation were discovered. Warning letters were sent to the persons concerned calling upon them to cause such unlawful occupation to cease. H. J. Rowling & Sons Ltd. (T.U.). 36 York Road, Battersea. S.W.11.
