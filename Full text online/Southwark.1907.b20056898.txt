Public Health Office, Town Hall, Walworth Road. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my Twenty-First Annual Report on the vital statistics and general sanitary work of the Borough for the year 1907. There has been no epidemic of infectious disease of any magnitude. Scarlet Fever which was high in 1906, declined in the year under consideration. Several cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever, some of which were fatal, occurred. The year upon the whole has been a healthy one. The general coldness of the summer and autumn was unfavourable to the spread of infant diarrhœa, which in its lowness marked a record. All matters such as the visiting of infants, the examination of food stuffs, and the certifying of places where food is sold have been attended to as heretofore. The multifarious duties of the staff have been zealously performed. I have to thank the Council and the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. 5 SUMMARY OF STATISTICS.

The deaths of Infants under one year of age to 1,000 births were 142 during the year 1907. The deaths under one year of age to 1,000 births for the last 15 years were as follows : 1893 178 1901 168 1894 163 1902 166 1895 201 1903 148 1896 192 1904 174 1897 187 1905 148 1898 190 1906 144 1899 199 1907 142 1900 192 The average number of Infantile deaths for the last fifteen years is 173. POPULATION. The chief feature in the population of the Borough is the increasing reversion to nomadic instincts which in the last few years has taken such hold of all classes of the inhabitants. Although the exodus of the well-to-do portion is in many ways to be deplored, yet the splitting up or part removal of slum residents has had a highly educational effect upon those left behind. The Clandon Street area in regard to new buildings is approaching completion, but it can hardly be expected that the usual number of people housed there before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners cleared the site will be found resident again before the next census is taken. Our large property owners have found it very difficult to let their houses at the rents obtaining a few years ago, and in many cases a reduction of more than ten per cent. has been made. In the middle of the year it was estimated that five per cent. of the properties in the Borough were empty, and that three per cent. paid no rates, the difference being accounted for by "compounding." The old style of letting to one person of houses of three or more storeys is fast giving way, owing to the indisposition of tenants to undertake the responsibility of so large a rent, to floor or suite letting. There is evidence all over the Borough of shrinkage of incomes shown by the removal of families into more restricted house accommodation or to the 7 suburbs where rent is less. In the lower class of tenements there is beginning to be seen a great improvement in the way of cleanliness brought about by the careful application of the provisions of the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904. The cleansing of verminous school children has also brought home to parents in a very forcible manner the great inconvenience they are likely to suffer in having their rooms and contents disinfected, when the children are found to be verminous. The necessity of a supply of water and a sink on the several storeys of a tenemented house is a splendid piece of legislation, and in the few hundred cases already provided with such accommodation the gratitude of the tenants ha3 been loudly expressed. The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1841, and also the estimated population for 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906 and 1907— Newington. St. George's.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1907 was 6,023, of which 3,081 were males, and 2,942 females. This represents a birth-rate of 28.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births in the individual parishes was 3,613 in Newington, 1,815 in St. George the Martyr, 264 in Christchurch and 331 in St. Saviour's. In addition to the 6,023 births registered in the Borough I learn from the Registrar General that there were 209 births during the year in various lying-in institutions outside the Borough belonging to persons 9 resident in Southwark, and this number (209) must be added to the total as above, making the actual number of births for the year 6,232, which increases the birth.rate to 29.8 per 1,000. As the addresses in relation to these 209 birtbs have not been communicated to me I am unable to allot them to their respective wards.

Of the 3,066 deaths registered in the sub-districts of the Borough, 927 occurred in the Poor-Law institutions, the various hospitals, and other public places for the treatment of the sick found within our boundaries. These deaths in institutions comprised 338 belonging to Southwark, and 589 to other boroughs of the metropolis. The various localities in which the "outlying" deaths occurred are shown in the following table. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is, outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,294. Of this very large number as many as 761 died in the Southwark Infirmary at Champion Hill. The remainder, with but few exceptions, died at the large public hospitals. The percentage of persons dying away from home in relation to the total number o deaths occurring in the Borough was 343 TABLE 3. Outlying Deaths, with Localities. Males. Females. Total.

The death-rate when calculated on this "corrected" number is 18.0 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1907, which is a similar rate to that of 1906. 15 TABLE 4.

The coldness of the summer and autumn whilst lessening the number of fatal cases of diarrhæa increased considerably the number of those of pneunomia and bronchitis. The deaths from measles and whooping cough, most likely from the same cause, were much increased. Premature birth was the cause of death in about the same number of cases as in the preceding year of 1906. The percentage of those dying in the first week of life was 16.9 of the total for the year, whilst 30.2 per cent. died in the first month. So that of the deaths in the first month 56 per cent. died in the first week. The importance of regularly visiting and reporting on the progress of infants in the first year of their existence cannot well be over-estimated. The work, however, if well done takes a vast amount of time to accomplish. In Southwark a portion of the time of two lady inspectors is directed to this duty. The history in the case of 310 infants was collected and the progress followed during the first year, or as long as they remained in the borough. It was found that out of the 310 cases, 252 were entirely breastfed, 22 were artificially fed, and 36 were for the first month or more breastfed and subsequently artificially fed. The chief artificial food being cows milk. To show the migratory habits of our inhabitants it is only necessary to state that before the end of the year 172 of the total number of 310 infants had been removed into other boroughs. The removals took place principally about the 7th month, hardly any up to the 2nd month. The recorded deaths were 34, and the number that remained with us at the end of the year was 104. Although the removals from the borough numbered so many it could not be expected there would be any great mortality among them, as with very few exceptions they had all been weaned. This total number of infants systematically reported upon may be thought to be small, but still it appears to me to be a fair beginning, and I hope we shall improve upon it in years to come. At the present time it seems hardly possible that we shall ever be able to examine the whole of the children born in this populous district as the yearly births number between 6,000 and 7,000, but public opinion will probably demand that this work must be done. .. 27 TABLE 10 INFANTILE MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1907.

No case of this disease was notified during the year 1907. Deaths from Small-pox during the last ten years:— 1898 — 1903 — 1899 — 1904 1 1900 — 1905 — 1901 14 1906 — 1902 78 1907 — SCARLET FEVER. The deaths from Scarlet Fever in the borough were 35 during 1907, as against 45 for the year 1906, and 28 for 1905. In this borough Scarlet Fever of late appears to have had a cycle of five years. The disease reached its height of prevalency in 1897, 1901, and 1906 We may, therefore, expect to see the decline, which commenced in 1907, continuing for the next few years, until a fresh and more susceptible population has arisen. The increase in certain years of this and similar infectious diseases cannot be due to want of care in the removal of the sick from the healthy, nor from any failure in the way of disinfection, or other preventive measures. With our present knowledge it can simply be said that in certain years these complaints spread in spite of all sanitary activity, whilst at other times no amount of fostering, even if that were tried, would produce a fairly respectable epidemic. It has not yet been explained why we have these seasonal outbursts. It is the same in all similar complaints whether small-pox, measles, whooping cough, and the host of diseases we are accustomed to associate with infancy. I think it must be admitted that when epidemic disease breaks out in a family where the house accommodation is very limited it is a good and reasonable thing to remove the child affected to hospital so as to prevent contact with other and healthy members of the family. In this borough the removal of so many children suffering from Scarlet Fever to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board has certainly been coincident with the increasing mildness of the disease one has noticed for so many years. The malignant form of the disease pretty common twenty-five years ago, when few had other than home treatment, may be said to have disappeared. It has been stated that hospitals for Scarlet Fever have not quite fulfilled their mission, inasmuch as since their existence the number of cases of the disease has not materially diminished. Without admitting such to be 52 exactly the case, other advantages, such as the removal of the cases from the poorer homes, and the increasing mildness of the complaint which may ho reasonably put forward as a likely effect, must be taken as of considerable value. The total number of cases notified was 1,275 this year, as against 1,470 for 1906. The percentage of deaths to the total cases notified was 2.7. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.16. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In South wark. In London. 1898 1,007 16,920 1903 512 12,531 1899 837 18,094 1904 415 13,438 1900 689 13,809 1905 776 19,461 1901 1,301 18.390 1906 1,470 20,329 1902 1,098 18,394 1907 1,275 25,925 Number of deaths from Scarlet Fever during the last ten years:— In Southwark.

The deaths in the 1,232 cases sent to hospital numbered 34, a mortality of 2.7 per cent. as against 3.2 per cent. for last year. In the 43 cases treated at home, which evidently were very mild in character, there was one death, a mortality of 2.3 per cent. It is our practice to spray the room well with formalin and to strip the paper off the walls in the process of disinfection after Scarlet Fever. In the event of the room boing verminous it is afterwards fumigated with sulphur. The Wards moat affected were St. Michael's, All Saints', St. Mary's and Trinity. 53 DIPHTHERIA. The disease has very slightly increased both in the number of cases notified and in the number of deaths. Since 1904, when the disease had reached the lowest point on record, diphtheria has not shown anything like its former disposition to regain its usual level of severity in the borough. I hope some little portion of this is due to the lessened pollution of the subsoil after storms, which in the year under consideration has certainly been less than formerly. The large number of new houses which have recently been built without an underground basement must by reason of the dryness of the site assist in maintaining a better state of health in our inhabitants. We 3till have in the older portion of the borough a large number of houses standing on a damp and rotten site. Owners complain very much at times on being required to cover the surface with concrete, but such treatment is necessary to render the the houses fairly habitable. The deaths from the disease numbered 36 as against 31 for the year 1906. The total number of cases notified, including Membranous Croup, was 422, and 401 for the preceding year. The percentage of deaths to the total number of cases notified was 8 5. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0-17. The number of cases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— In Southwark. In London. In Southwark. In London. 1898 825 11,883 1903 354 7,738 1899 1,298 13,092 1904 281 7,220 1900 784 11,990 1905 304 6.482 1901 558 12.154 1906 401 8,045 1902 539 10,735 1907 422 8,771 Number of deaths from Diphtheria during the last ten years:— In Southwark.

The Wards most affected were St. George's, St. Mary's, St. Peter's and St. Michael's, in the order named. ENTERIC FEVER. The deaths from Enteric Fever during the year numbered 11, as against 12, 11 and 18 for the preceding three years. The total number of cases notified was 80 for the present year, and 111, 74 and 92 for the preceding three years. The percentage of deaths to the total number notified was 13.7. The annual mortality per 1,000 living was 0.05. The deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1898 20 1903 23 1899 32 1904 18 1900 39 1905 11 1901 18 1906 12 1902 23 1907 11 The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1898 144 1903 122 1899 178 1904 92 1900 307 1905 74 1901 135 1906 111 1902 193 1907 80 Of the 80 cases notified as many as 74 were removed to hospital, of which 7 died, a mortality of 9.4 per cent. In the 6 cases treated at home 4 died, a mortality of 66.6 per cent. The percentage of cases removed to hospital to the total number notified was 92.5. The history of every case of Enteric Fever has been carefully obtained. The exact cause of the complaint in each case has been very difficult to determine. In 3 cases Mussels were suspected, in 4 Oysters, in 3 Periwinkles, and in 5 other shell fish. 55 DIARRHEA. The deaths during the year from this disease numbered 101, as against 225 for the previous year. The continued coldness of the summer and early autumn contributed in a large measure to this result. There was a very marked diminution in the number of flies present with us during the summer. These are largely influenced by the foul accumulations of manure in stables and the filthy state of the contents of dustbins. The fly pest is responsible in all probability for not only much of the summer infant diarrhaea, but for a host of other diseases. London would be much improved in health if the boroughs would adopt the continental method of having the dustbins emptied once a day during the summer. With regard to the storage and removal of manure, I am compelled to say that there is a remarkable timidity on the part of sanitary officials in this borough to put in force the powers possessed by them for the removal of nuisance from foul manure which does so much harm to the comfort and health of our inhabitants. The annual death-rate from Diarrhaea per 1,000 living was 0.48. Deaths from diarrhæa during the last ten years:— 1898 306 1903 197 1899 260 1904 282 1900 233 1905 183 1901 222 1906 225 1902 169 1907 101 TYPHUS FEVER. No death occurred from this disease during the year, and no case was notified. MEASLES. The deaths from Measles during the year numbered 112, as against 95, 154 and 191 for the previous three years. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.53. Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1898 145 1903 83 1899 171 1904 191 1900 116 1905 154 1901 161 1906 95 1902 164 1907 112 The Wards mostly affected were St. John's, St. Michael's and St. Saviour's in the order named. 5G WHOOPING COUGH. The deaths from thin disease were 103 for this year and 54 for 1000. The Wards of St. Mary, St. John and All Saints were those most affected. The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.40. Deaths from Whooping Cough for the last ton years:— 1898 93 1908 68 1899 146 1904 118 1900 120 1905 80 1901 98 1906 54 1902 114 1907 103 CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. In the early months of the year several well pronounced case of this disease were brought to my notice. The disease was made notifiable for six months from the 12th March, and for a further period of eighteen months from the 13th September. Eleven cases were notified in the year under consideration two of which were suffering from other diseases. The nine cases were—male 7.½ years, female 8 years, female 8 years, male 8 years, male 8 months, female 5 years, female 7 months, female 1 year 9 months, and female 4 months. All but one case were removed to hospital and stated to bo suffering from the disease, confirmed by bacteriological examination. PHTHISIS. The deaths from this disease during the year numbered 425, whilst only 335 cases were notified to mo. This small number of notifications in a borough where between 3,000 and 4,000 cases are present, shows how utterly inadequate is the voluntary notification of the disease if any steps are to be taken either in the way of disinfection, or for the improvement of the surroundings of the patient, from a public health point of view. The cases notified are usually in the last stage of the disease and returned by the Poor-law medical officer. I can quite understand that the private practitioner cannot in the present state of things afford to give the information required by voluntary notification, which would bring upon him an amount of opprobrium and probably loss of his patient. All 57 that of course would be obviated if every medical man had to notify, or at least Phthisis would be placed on the same footing as the other notifiable diseases. An important Conference of representatives of City and Metropolitan Borough Councils on the question of taking measures to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) was held at the Paddington Town Hall, on June 6th, 1907, when the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— (1) That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary culosis (Consumption) should be compulsory. (2) That application be made to the Local Government Board for an order to be made— (i) To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and (ii.) To extend the provisions of the following Sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption)— Section 60.—Cleansing and disinfection of premises, &c. ,,61.—Disinfection of bedding, &c. ,,62.—Infectious rubbish thrown into ash pits, &c., to be disinfected. ,,63.—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging. ,,64.—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements as to infectious disease. „65.—Penalty on ceasing to occupy house without disinfection or notice to owner or making false answer. (3) That in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable, in order to limit the spread of Tuberculosis, that provision should be made for public inspection and control at its several sources, of the milk supply of England, and that the Local Government Board 58 be asked to take steps to secure the efficient adminstration of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885. and orders amending the same, by making compulsory regulations. (4) That application be made to the Local Goverment Board for an Order to be made to extend the provisions of Section 69 of the Public Health (London) Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis in so far as it relates to the milking of cows and to the sale and distribution of milk. (5) That the provision conferred by Section 7 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, viz.:—that in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation maintained, be rigidly enforced, and a similar provision extended to all places where people are assembled together for any lengthened period, with a view to restricting the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. (6) (a) That a Sanatorium is needed for the open-air treatment of poor persons suffering from Pulmonary Consumption, in the early stages of the disease, and should be provided by a Central Authority acting for the Metropolis as a whole. (b) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, by reason of their practical experience in the management of hospitals for infectious disease, being eminently qualified for the position of such authority, the Local Government Board be requested to confer on, or if necessary to obtain for. the said Managers power to act in that capacity. (c) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should also be empowered to use for sanatorium purposes the "Southern Hospital," recently erected by them at Carshalton, in the County of Surrey. (7) That this Conference appoint a deputation to wait upon the Government to urge the desirability of their providing a sum of money annually for the erection and maintenance of suitable Sanitoria for the treatment of early cases of consumption. The Southwark Borough Council, on a recommendation of its Public Health Committee, adopted resolutions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and G (c), and no action was taken on resolutions Nos. G (a) and (6) and 7. 59 TABLE 31. Age Groups of Cases of Phthisis notified during the Year ending December 28th, 1907. Ward. 0- 1- 5- 10- 15- 20- 25- 35- 45- 55- 65- 75- 85- Males. Females Total.

I have on many occasions reported on the insufficient accommodation afforded by the two stations for the careful and efficient disinfection of all the articles needing such treatment. The stations are placed one in the northern and the other in the southern portion of the borough. Each is provided with one of Manlove and Alliot's WashingtonLyon Apparatus which is the only equipment. There is no laundry or means of washing stained clothing, nor is there any room attached in which articles likely to be damaged by steam or hot air can be exposed to the vapor of formalin or other similar disinfectant. The floor space of the station, especially the one at Manor Place, is far too small under ordinary conditions of working. There is no provision for the men employed either for bathing or for the storing or changing of their personal clothing when work is over, nor for the taking of meals. Further, there is no accommodation for the disinfectors in regard to the same matters. The consequence is that all the men, intimately concerned with the disinfection of rooms and clothing, mix freely with the outside public under conditions likely to propagate infectious disease. Beyond this the clothing and bedding of our inhabitants is at times so damaged, by the stains being fixed and which could have been removed by suitable washing, that serious loss is sustained. The Public Health Committee has had this matter of damage to clothing under its consideration, but I hardly think it appreciates the extent to which the borough suffers. Complaints are often received by me with a request for compensation, but owing to the extreme poverty of many of the sufferers hardly a tithe of them do otherwise than accept the situation as inevitable and the natural accompaniment of an attack of infectious disease. The plea has hitherto been that on the grounds of economy an extension of one of the stations cannot be entertained. I believe the borough is losing much more by the delay in bringing the means of disinfection up to a state of efficiency. DISINFECTION AFTER INFECTIOUS DISEASE. The number of rooms disinfected during the year was 3,459, of which 872 were stripped; 3,238 rooms were disinfected, and 1,057 rooms were stripped in the year 1906. Disinfection has been carried out periodically in every instance where a case of Phthisis was notified. 63 TABLE 33. The Locality of Rooms Disinfected. St. Mary's Ward. St. Paul's Ward.

In reply to the circular letter received from the Clerk of the London County Council desiring to know what provision has been made for the cleansing of verminous persons I beg to report that a bath room with undressing and waiting rooms, together with a Washington-Lyon's disinfecting apparatus and rooms, have been provided adjoining the Reception House. We have ample equipment in regard to staff for the cleansing of any number of adults and children that may be sent on to us. Up to the present time, however, we have not received a sufficient number of persons to keep the staff, originally organised for the purpose, daily engaged. We have, therefore, for the sake of economy arranged for school children as far as possible to be sent to us on three days of the week, viz.:—Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. We have also arranged with the London County Council nurses for them to advise us on the day before the children are sent, of the number of children we are likely to have to deal with, so that we may be prepared to attend to them without delay on the bathing day. We are particularly careful that adults and children shall be kept separate, and be treated at different times in the day. We are also careful that the two sexes of children shall be bathed at different times, only children of different sexes under six years of age are allowed in the bath rooms at the same time. Cards admitting persons to the Bathing Station are put into the hands of the nurses for their use. On the same day as the school children are bathed and their clothes disinfected, the bedding upon which they have been sleeping is also collected, disinfected and returned home. The rooms are also fumigated, and when necessary, the paper is stripped off the walls. Cases of verminous casuals are received on any day of the week and attended to. A man and his wife are engaged for the bath rooms, the woman attending to the bathing and cleansing of the children and women, and the man to big boys and adult males. 66 Flannel gowns are provided for use whilst the verminous clothing is being disinfected. In order to ensure the smooth working of matters an officer visits early in the morning the cases of school children to be bathed during the day, so that the parents may be informed of our mode of procedure. Hitherto our practice of removing the bedding at the same time has been carried out without undue irritation. The following rules have been framed for the guidance of those engaged in bathing. G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. BATH HOUSE. Rules For Bathing. 1.—The temperature of the bath water shall not exceed 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) aud the heat of the water shall be ascertained by the attendant, by means of the thermometer provided, before each person enters the bath. 2. —On no account shall water of a temperature exceeding 100 degrees be run into the bath. If both the gas and water taps of the geyser be turned on full bore the water will enter the bath at a temperature below 100 degrees, and this practice shall always be observed. 3.— The bath filled to one-third of its capacity will be found sufficient for each person. 4.—One half of a 4 oz bottle of Izal disinfectant fluid shall be added to each bath. 5.—All portions of the body covered with hair shall be well washed with Izal soap. 6.—Each person shall be bathed separately and with fresh clean water. 7.—The two sexes shall not be allowed in the bath room at the same time. 8.—Children shall not be allowed to mix with adults, male or female, in the bathing station. 9.—Whilst persons are being bathed their clothing shall be disinfected. 10.—After the bathing and drying of the body and head, the hair of the head and other parts must be well combed and smeared with the ointment provided for that purpose. 67 11.—A flannel gown, as provided, shall be worn whilst waiting for the disinfection of clothing. 12.— A box of ointment, upon which are directions for use, shall be given to each person on leaving. 13.—In the case of children mothers shall be advised to cut the hair short and to use frequently a small-tooth comb. 14.—The room and contents belonging to persons being cleansed will be simultaneously cleansed and disinfected. 15.—The bathing attendant must keep the bath rooms and contents in a scrupulously clean condition and whilst attending to her duties must wear the overall provided. 16.—The hours of attendance at the bathing station shall be from 10 o'clock, a.m. to 12 noon, and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Adults and casuals at any time. Verminous Persons Cleansed during 1907. During the year 1907 there were cleansed at the Bathing Station 458 persons. of which number 22 were adults applying to be cleansed under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. The remainder were children sent from the London County Council Schools. TABLE 36. Verminous Bedding, &c., Disinfected at the Council's Stations during 1907. Articles. Disinfected. Destroyed.

Under Burial Act 20 and 21. Vic., Cap. 81., s. 25. In October whilst preparations were being made for the erection of a Gymnasium at the rear of the Mission Hall in Collier's Rents, which is the site of an old Burial Ground, certain brick vaults full of coffins were uncovered. The particulars were reported to the Home Secretary who directed that the coffins and human remains should be taken to Brookwood Cemetery and reburied. The following report was made to the Council:— Old Burial Ground in connection with the London Congregational Union's Chapel in Collier's Rents. During the extension and repair of this chapel the builder in digging foundations for the new structure came upon certain vaults containing coffins and human remains. The matter was reported to the Medical Officer of Health. On visiting the old burial ground I found two vaults containing several coffins, dated about 1780, which would have to be removed to make way for the new building. 70 I wrote to the Home Secretary explaining matters and obtained his licence to have the coffins removed and reburied in another part of the burial ground. The old Chapel, which is much out of repair, was built about 1766, and the foundations rest upon masses of bones, showing that the burial ground was in existence before the Chapel was built; indeed, it would appear from the human remains unearthed, that this burial ground must have existed for a long time prior to 1766. The foundation walls not being sufficiently substantial it was necessary to have them underpinned, and in carrying out this work a further discovery of coffins was made beneath the floor of the basement of the Chapel and in bricked-up alcoves on either side. These alcoves, which were six in number, on either side of the basement, contained 112 coflins together with a large quantity of loose human remains. The burials in this basement, which appears to have been excavated after the Chapel was built, commenced about 1813 and the last burial was in 1832. In consequence of the further discovery of human remains I wrote again to the Home Secretary informing him of the new discovery and stating that, in my opinion, the coffins were a danger to health and must be removed to a cemetery outside of London, and requesting, at the same time, that the Home Office Inspector might view the place with me. Dr. Branthwaite inspected the place with me and came to the conclusion that the conditions were a danger to health, and subsequently I received a letter from the Home Secretary informing me that the Inspector recommended:—"that the brick alcoves on either side of the hall in which remains are at present stored, should be totally removed, the outside walls lined with cement, and the floor over the whole site covered with a foot of concrete and cement,” and that the licence would be issued by the Home Secretary when arrangements had been made for the removal of the bodies. On the 3rd January the licence reached me, in which the following conditions were stated:— (1) That the removal be effected with due care and attention to decency, early in the morning. (2) That freshly made ground lime be freely sprinkled over the coffins, the soil, or any other matter that may be offensive; and 71 (3) That the remains be forthwith re-interred in the London Necropolis Company's Cemetery at Brookwood, Surrey, under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Southwark. The removal of the 112 coffins, together with a number of boxes of loose human remains, was carried out by the London Necropolis Co. to their cemetery at Brookwood on the 6th and 7th of January, and at the expense of the London Congregational Union, who are Lessees of the Chapel and Burial Ground from the City of London. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. The Council at a meeting held on November 27th, 1907, unanimously resolved to adopt the Notification of Births Act, 1907, in the area of the Borough. It was further resolved that a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded to the Local Government Board, and that they be requested to give their consent thereto, as from the 1st January, 1908. In the early part of March the Local Government Board notified their assent to the Act coming into force on March 16th, when the following notice was posted up and widely distributed throughout the Borough :— BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Publtc Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E., 12th March, 1908. Dear Sir (or Madam), Notification of Births Act, 1907. The Council of the Borough of Southwark have, by resolution, adopted in their area the above Act, which has for its object the early notification of births to Medical Officers of Health, and the Local Government Board have assented to such adoption taking effect as from 16th March, 1908. 72 The Act requires that the Council shall bring the provisions of this Act to the attention of all parents residing, and ail medical practitioners and midwives practising in their area. The Act provides that in the case of every child born it shall be the duty of the father of the child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of, or within six hours after the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the child was born. Notice is to be given by delivering or posting a prepaid letter or postcard addressed to the Medical Officer of Health at his office at the Town Hall, giving information of the birth within thirtysix hours after such birth. The Borough Council are required to supply, without chargeaddressed and stamped post or letter cards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife residing or practising in their area who applies for the same. Any person who fails to give notice of the birth within the period named, will be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings. This notice is to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the ordinary registration of births, and it applies to any child born, whether alive or dead, after the expiration of the twenty-eighth week of pregnancy. It is very desirable that the provisions of this Act be made widely known, and I shall be glad if everyone will assist me in this matter as far as possible. Forms for giving notice of births may be obtained on application at the Public Health Office. Yours faithfully, G. B. Millson, Medical Officer of Health. 73 SANITARY WORK, ST. MARY'S WARD.

Under the head of "Periodical inspection of the eating houses, stables, workshops, &c. and premises where homework is done" the following report was made to the Public Health Committee:— The practice of having a three-monthly examination of the eating houses of the Borough, which was ordered by the Public Health Committee some time ago to be made and a report of their condition to be submitted, has been attended by such excellent results that I think it is now advisable that such a periodical examination should be made of all factories, workshops, workplaces and premises where homework is done. Recently it has been said that the examination of these premises, and especially those of the homeworkers, has not been so regularly carried out as it should have been. I am afraid that there is much truth in this statement. I would therefore advise the Committee to insist upon a three-monthly examination being made of all factories, workshops, workplaces and the premises of homeworkers, and a report being submitted to the Committee. This three-monthly examination has been extended to bakehouses, slaughterhouses, knackers' yards, premises where offensive trades are carried on and stables. In my opinion it is very necessary that a formal report of all the places mentioned should be presented to the Committee as soon as possible after the examination has been made. The extension of the practice of giving a certificate would be attended by the best results. On the consideration of the above report the Public Health Committe ordered the following further report to be made. 16th December, 1907. OUTWORKERS. I have to report that during the year the number of outworkers' addresses received officially was 799. On the Register there are 1342 outworkers, and 133 women's workshops which are also outworkers' premises, making a total of 90 1475. These include the outworkers supervised by both the male and female inspectors. The number of female outworkers far exceeds that of the males. The total visits paid to the outworkers premises during 1905 was 682, in 1906, 829, and in 1907 (11 months of the year) 850. I submit a table (Table 44.) of the number on the register and the individual visits for each ward of the Borough. I have also had taken out every visit made to an outworker, with the month in which the visits were made. It will be seen that the visiting has not been carried on in a regular and systematic manner. On looking through the the lists of the premises it will be readily seen that many of those on the register have not been visited for two or three years, and it is only fair to assume that some of them have ceased to be outworkers for some time, or have gone away, as their names do not appear on the official lists. In my opinion it is essential that there should be a report made from time to time by the officers in charge of this work, whether that time should be every three or six months is a matter for consideration. The gross number of outworkers, 1475, now found on the register would be, I am sure, materially diminished by such regular inspection. The visiting of outworkers is a very important matter and ought to be conducted in a more systematic manner. Some of these outworkers, especially those making clothing, might be the means, if the work is conducted under insanitary conditions, of propagating disease. It has been suggested that the Home Office should take over this work of supervision, and that a certificate should be given once a year when the premises are in a healthy condition. I think our Council should aim at something Iike this method, a certificate to be given once a year and a report made, either every three, or six months, to the Committee on the state of these places. 91 With regard to the workshops, I may also state that the visiting and inspection are open to much inprovement, many of those now on the register show that they have been visited in a very irregular manner. G. B. MILLSON. Medical Officer of Health. On the 11th May, 1908, The Public Health Committee directed (a) That Miss Elliott, the chief woman inspector, be requested to make all original inspections of outworkers. (b) That all reinspections be made by the other two women inspectors. (c) That the chief woman inspector report to the Committee, through the medical officer of health, once in every six months the result of all original inspections and reinspections of outworkers and the number on the register. 92 TABLE 44.

The sanitary inspector charged with the inspection of food landed at the river bank and stored in the warehouses adjoining, has had up to last year to inspect besides about a thousand houses lying to the north of Southwark street. This house inspection took up considerable time and hindered him very much in carrying out the more important part of his duty, viz.:—the watching of food about to be landed at the wharves. On the appointment of a new food inspector, which took place towards the end of the year, the Council decided to remove ordinary house inspection from his duties, and to make him responsible for food landed at the wharves and stored in any part of the borough, together with the sanitary condition of the wharves and warehouses on the river bank. Although the food inspector is charged with the duty of searching for unsound food in any part of the borough, the ordinary ward inspector is not in any way relieved of a similar duty in his ward; the two officers in that respect being expected to work together. It is thought that by so doing the valuable information obtained by the food inspector at the wharves may be of great service to the ward inspectors in the prevention of the sale of unsound food in the borough. I am glad to be able to report that this new arrangement is working very satisfactorily. During the year it will be seen that immense quantities of foodstuffs have been dealt with, and a considerable quantity of unsound food has been destroyed. Important seizures have been made and heavy fines have been inflicted. The powers now being sought by the London County Conncil in their General Powers Bill of this year, in regard to the surrender of acknowledged unsound food and the payment for removal, will be useful when they come into force. They will prevent food admitted to be unsound being removed by unsound food dealers, ostensibly for the purpose of feeding chickens and such like, but really to be offered again for human consumption. They will not help us, however, in regard to food in dispute as to unsoundness. Nor can I see that they will in any way remove the difficulty of entry, or the vexed question of the goods being in transit. Although as a matter of fact we are allowed by the wharfingers to enter wharves and seize unsound food, which the magistrate afterwards condemns, we should be unable to do so if resisted. In a case of seizure of a large quantity of tinned salmon which took place some time ago in this borough, the summons was dismissed on the grounds (1) That the goods were in transit; (2) That the wharfingers were neither vendors nor owners; (3) That the goods were practically in bond. We have recently had 10,000 unsound rabbits seized at the Cold Stores (Hanbury's Wharf), also two cases of unsound oranges seized at St. Mary Overy Wharf, 94 and 125 bags of unsound onions seized at Universal Wharf, Bankaide. In all these cases the goods were condemned by the Magistrate, but he refused to convict either the consignee, the broker, or the wharfinger, as ho felt it was difficult to say how far either of these persons was aware of the unsound condition of the articles. The Council had to bear the cost of removal in each case as no conviction was obtained. It has been suggested that the boroughs should remove all unsound food free of charge. If the Council of Southwark were obliged to collect all unsound food, without remuneration, that is thrown aside in the process of sorting, and which is now taken away and paid for as trade refuse, the Council would be put to the expense of many hundreds of pounds a year. Wo are hoping that before long Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, will bo extended in the direction of (1) That there shall ho no restriction of the entry of an officer to premises upon which any article intended for the food of man is either stored, or being prepared or deposited, or in transit, and that a penalty shall accrue upon any refusal or hindrance to such entry. (2) That all unsound food, by virtue of its unsoundness, shall have become the property of the Council, and that it shall bo unlawful for any person upon whose premises such unsound food is deposited, to in any way permit, or allow it to bo removed, sold, or otherwise disposed of. Notice of the possession of unsound food shall be given forthwith by the owner of the premises, or the person in whose possession tho unsound food is found, to the local authority. A penalty in default. 95 TABLE 45. The undermentioned Foodstuffs have been examined by the Inspectors during the year 1907. Bacon, 15 tons 10 cwt. 2 qrs. 25 lbs.

The following case showed extensive dealings in unsound food by Eating House proprietors who advertise themselves as purveyors of cheap food for the people:— Canned Meat and Soup. Seizure and Prosecution (Mr. Long's Report). On the fourteenth of June last information was brought to the office by Inspector Langstone, of the Shoreditch Borough Council, that a quantity of meat and soup had been deposited in a lock-up shed in Montague Street, Borough, which food was bad and quite unfit for human consumption. I went at once to the shed and found that it was nearly filled with cases containing tins; and leaving them in charge of Mr. Howes and Mr. Jenkinson, I went to Tower Bridge Court and obtained a warrant to search the premises. Upon returning, we proceeded to examine the contents of the tins, and found that they contained beef in soup in a most foul and decomposing condition, and quite unfit for human food. Of this kind there were 25 cases and two sacks, containing altogether 330 tins, each tin containing about 10 lbs. In the other 35 cases there were 210 tins, each containing about 14 lbs. of minced meat in an equally unsound state, and unfit for food. I had the whole of them removed in two vans to the Manor Place Depot, and on the following morning I had them conveyed before the Magistrate and condemned. They were subsequently destroyed. The whole of this meat had been brought from 31, St. John's Road, Shoreditch, where it had been deposited in a shed at the rear of a common lodging house belonging to James Shuttleworth, the reputed owner of several large eating houses in various parts of London. On the 24th of July three summonses were taken out as follows: the first against James Shuttleworth, of 112, Pitfield Street, Hoxton, because the meat belonged to him at the time of the deposit; the second was against Edward Bowman, of 184, Kingsland Road, because the meat was in his possession at the time of the deposit; and the third was against Sarah Maney, of 317, Borough High Street, as the person to whom the premises belonged where the meat was found. This course being the only safe one to secure a conviction. In addition to the above five witnoss summonses were necessary against Mr. Bowman, Mrs. Maney, a man of the name of Ashton, another named Dodge, and Mr. Lamprell, of 227 Borough High Street, the landlord of the shed. A special witness summons was 103 also granted against Mr. John Thomas Long (a St. George in the East's Guardian), and a special officer sent from the Court to Ilford to serve the same, as it was alleged that he had sold the meat to Mr. Shuttleworth. The case came on for hearing on July 31st. Mr. Topham appearing for the Council, and Mr. Margetts for the defendant. Before any evidence was taken, their solicitor stated that Mr. Bowman was the owner of the meat and was prepared to take the whole responsibility if the other two summonses were withdrawn, and this course was agreed to, as we were then sure of a conviction. Evidence was given by Mr. Howes, Mr. Jenkmson and myself of all the particulars of the seizure, and of the condition of the meat, and it being entirely unfit for the food of man. In the cross-examination the defendant Shuttleworth appeared in a very bad light—as a large dealer in very questionable articles intended for the food of man, and the fact was mentioned that he had on the 19th of July been fined £50 and 25 guiueas costs at the Old Street Police Court for selling a very large quantity of unsound Condensed Milk. At the conclusion of the case the Magistrate, Mr. Cecil Chapman, inflicted a penalty of £50 and 5 guineas costs, which amount was immediately paid by Mr. Shuttleworth through Mr. Bowman. Kaloo Nuts The following case, heard at the Tower Bridge Court, showed gross carelessness on the part of the merchant in selling for food an article the properties of which he was totally ignorant of. In connection with the seizure of Kaloo nuts, the following is a report of the police court proceedings, taken from the " Daily Telegraph" of August 15th:— " Poisonous Nuts from China. " At the Tower Bridge Court, Benjamin Brinkley & Co., of Mitre Street, Aldgate, were summoned by Mr. Alfred Long, Chief Sanitary Inspector to the Borough of Southwark, for selling to a costermonger, named Ernest Taylor, a quantity of Kaloo nuts, which upon examination were found to be unwholesome and unfit for human food. Taylor, who lives at Blue Anchor Lane, Peckham, was summoned for exposing the nuts for sale at Great Dover Street and Borough High Street. 104 "Mr. Long said that on Saturday, August 3rd, several children were received at Guy's Hospital suffering from vegetable poisoning, and it was found that they had eaten Kaloo nuts purchased from the defendant Taylor. Information was given to the police, and the same day Taylor was traced and his barrowload of nuts seized. The nuts were found to be rancid and decomposed. He (Mr. Long) had made extensive enquiries concerning Kaloo nuts, and this was the first time that they had been introduced into this country. He had seen several wholesale fruit importers, and they all agreed that for the past fifty years certainly this kind of nut had never been upon the English market. He also visited the Kew Museum, and received every possible assistance. Information concerning the Kaloo nut was given in a bulletin issued from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in 1906. It seemed that the nuts grew in Central China. Two varieties of oil were obtained from the seeds. One, a yellow, transparent, thick oil, was used in Central China for varnishing lighting, purposes, and in the manufacture of oiled paper. The other was a thick, blackish liquid, and was used in coarser work. The bulletin added that the oil had poisonous properties. "Eliza Barber, aged sixteen, of 3 Little Britain, said she bought a pint of nuts from Taylor for 1d. Upon his barrow was a placard stating, ' The King of Nuts, Kaloo, from South America. First time sold in this country. Delicious flavour.' He said they were better than Brazils. She ate seven, and an hour afterwards became ill, and had to go to Guy's Hospital. Her young brother ate two, and he was also taken to the hospital. "Mr. Long : His case was looked upon as dangerous ? "Witness: Yes. They said that if he had been left an hour longer he would bave died. "Another girl named Annie Stevens, aged seventeen, stated that she likewise purchased a pennyworth, and after eating six was rendered ill. "Chief-Inspector Bonner, M Division, said that upon receiving information from Guy's Hospital he sent a message to all the London police stations. As a result Taylor was found at Blackheath, He gave every assistance, and seemed pleased that the police had taken action. "Dr. Millson, Medical Officer, observed that, apart from the question as to whether there were poisonous qualities in the oil of the 105 nuts, the physical condition of the nuts was such as to render them unfit for human food. They were rancid. "Taylor said he purchased the nuts from Mr. Brinkley for 7s. 6d. per cwt., and both he and Mr. Brinkley thought they were good. He and his children ate many without ill effects, and so did a man who was with him with the barrow. " Mr. Brinkley stated that the man who sold him the nuts was introduced to him by an old traveller. He ate several, and thought they were very good. He had been in the nut trade for sixteen years, and this was the first time he had heard that a nut was unfit for food. When he was informed that these were poisonous, he took all the necessary steps to prevent any more being sold. He believed the person who sold him the nuts was a ship's captain, and he would like to find him. He had spent five days trying in vain to do so. " Mr. Cecil Chapman : You did not know from whence they came?—I thought they came from South America. " And, as a matter of fact, they come from China?—Yes, we bought them as a novelty. "Mr. Cecil Chapman said that putting a novelty upon the public which was intended for food involved the responsibility of ascertaining whether it was wholesome and fit for human food. Brinkley would be fined £5 and two guineas costs, and the summons against Taylor would be withdrawn." AERATED WATERS FACTORIES. I have been asked by the owners of such factories in this borough to inspect them with the object of certifying that the premises are in a good sanitary state in regard to cleanliness, ventilation and the necessary convenience accommodation for the workpeople, also that the tanks, pipes and connections and the methods of working are such as to render contamination of the various drinks highly improbable. I know objection has been raised to the giving of certificates by a medical officer of health in such cases as it is thought it might lead to the certificate appearing in the form of an advertisement. The manufacturers have assured me that a certificate is not intended to be used for such a purpose. I have given a certificate in all cases I thought worthy of one, as the advantages of saying a kind word in favour of cleanly methods appeared to me to outweigh all anticipated troubles. 106 DECLARATION AND CERTIFICATES in connection with the export of meat foods to Argentina, as prescribed by the Local Government Board Memorandum, 1907.

For the purposes of section 48 (Provisions as to house without proper water supply) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a tenement house shall be deemed to be a house without a proper and sufficient supply of water unless there shall be provided on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes: Provided that with respect to any building existing and in use as a tenement house at the passing of this Act this Section shall not (A) come into operation until the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and eight, or (B) apply where the only storey or storeys on which a proper or sufficient supply of water is not provided is or are a storey or storeys (i) constructed at a height exceeding that to which the Metropolitan Water Board may for the time being be required to furnish a supply of water for domestic purposes, and (ii) to which a supply of water for such purposes is not at the passing of this Act being furnished by the said board by agreement: Provided also that this section shall not apply to any tenement house in respect of which it can be shown that any such provision for the supply of water as aforesaid is not reasonably necessary. 111 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890.

During the year complaints were received at the Public Health Office from persons other than the Council's Officers in regard to 125 nuisances from smoke occurring on different days. The undermentioned are premises in respect to which more than one complaint was so received:— Premises. No. of days on which nuisances were observed.

In submitting these particulars in regard to smoke complaints and subsequent proceedings, I may say that complaints received from outside sources must be substantiated by the health officers who are empowered with the carrying out of the Act, before any proceedings can be taken. The number of observations entered in our books, as having been made, has no relation to the actual amount of work done by the various inspectors in regard to the prevention of smoke nuisances, as it is one of the daily duties of every inspector to look round to see that no infringement of the smoke section of the Public Health Act is being made. 114 TABLE 51.
