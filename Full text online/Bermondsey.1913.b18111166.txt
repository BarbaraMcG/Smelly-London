Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OK THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Thirteenth Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Borough of Bermondsey during the year 1913, The death-rate was 17.98, compared with 16.9 in 1912 and 18.4 in 1911. The increase is entirely accounted for by the considerably larger number of deaths from non-tubercular pulmonary diseases and diarrœhal diseases. The sections of the report are, as usual, divided into:— I. —Vital Statistics. II. —Notification of Infectious Diseases. III.—Sanitary Administration. IV.—Factories and Workshops. In the Appendix will be found the Local Government Board Tables, including a special Table on Infantile Mortality. Again, I may record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordiality and co-operation throughout the year. Thanks are also due to the members of the staff for their hearty co-operation in carrying out the various duties devolving on the Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. KING BROWN. I.—VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The populations of the Borough of Bermondsey and its registration sub-districts, as enumerated in the Census of 1901 and 1911, and the estimate for the year under report, are as follows:— 1901. 1911. Estimated to June 30th, 1913. 82,483 81,833 81,959 Bermondsey Rotherhithe 38,460 34,477 35,247 9,817 8,429 St. Olave 8,697 130,760 124,739 Borough 125,903 As the Census is taken in April, it is usual to calculate the various rates on the mean population, which is assumed to be that existing at the end of June or the middle of the year under report. To arrive at this it is therefore necessary to estimate for a further three months, which in Bermondsey is assumed to be a decrease. The decrease is partly due to the increased facilities of transit, leading to a tendency on the part of the population of this, as well as other central boroughs, to seek residence further out. This is an object to be desired, since it is benefici0al alike to those going and those remaining, for only in this way can sufficient space be provided round houses and overcrowding on large areas be avoided. If the demand for slum property ceased it would soon lead to its abolition. Another cause of decrease is the replacement of small house property by factories and warehouses as soon as the leases fall in. This cause is slow but steady and will gradually displace the population towards the periphery of the metropolis. Births. The total number of births registered in the Borough for the 53 weeks ended January 3rd, 1914, was 3,842, consisting of 1,939 males and 1,903 females. This is 213 below the average for the last 10 years, and 43 above the figure for 1912. This total includes 2,548 for Bermondsey, being 46 above that for 1912, and 154 below the average for the last 10 years; 1,074 for Rotherhithe, being 9 above the number for 1912, and 16 below the average for the last 10 years; and 220 for St. Olave, being 12 below the number for 1912, and 44 below the average for the last 10 years. In Table 11. of the appendix will be seen the figures for the last 10 years in the three registration sub-districts, and in Table I. figures for the whole Borough. The birth-rate for 1913 was 30.8 per thousand persons living, which is 0.5 above that for 1912 and 0.9 below the average for the last 10 years. Particulars of rates will be found in annexed Table A. London is included for comparison. A new departure with regard to births was made by the Registrar-General in 1906. The births are corrected by distributing those which occurred in the chief lying-in hospitals of the Metropolis to the Boroughs in which the mothers had resided previous to admission. Those allocated to Bermondsey in 1913 number 23, and if they are added to the above total the rate would be 31 .0. TABLE A—BIRTH-RATES. Year. Bermondsey. Whole Borough. Rotherhithe. St. Olave.

Marriages. The total number of marriages in the Borough in 1913 was 1,203, being 21 above the number for 1912, and 89 above the average for the last 10 years. In Table VIII. of the Appendix will be found particulars of numbers and rates in the three Registration Sub-districts. The numbers have been supplied by the Superintendent Registrar. Deaths. In Table IV. of Appendix will be found the Local Government Board tables dealing with deaths in the Borough. The extended table of causes of death initiated in 1904 will also be found in the Appendix. The total number of deaths registered in the Borough for the year ended December 31st, 1913, was 1,730, which is 129 more than in 1912, and 156 less than the average for the last 10 years. When this figure is corrected by exclusion of deaths of nonparishioners occurring in the district, and the inclusion of deaths of parishioners occurring outside the district, the number is raised to 2,243. This is 124 more than in 1912, and 131 less than the average for the last 10 years. The annexed table shows the distribution of deaths in quarters, together with the corresponding quarters of 1912. The largest number of deaths occurred in the first quarter of the year. TABLE B.—DEATHS. Quarter. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave. Whole Borough. 1912. 1912. 1913. 1912. 1913. 1912. 1913. 1913.

If the Census population be taken as the basis of calculation of the rate, it works out at 17.8, which is 1.0 above that for 1912. TABLE C.—DEATH RATES. Year. Bermondsey. Rotherhithe. St. Olave.

Bronchitis, pneumonia and diarrhœa and enteritis are chiefly accountable for the increase. In column I, foot of Table I. of the appendix, will be found a list of places where deaths of non-parishioners occurred in the district. There were 21 such deaths in all, against 20 in 1912, and 22 in 1911. 6 such deaths occurred in the infirmary; 9 in River Thames and Docks; I in an office; and 5 in the street. 534 persons belonging to this Borough died in outlying institutions, against 538 in 1912, and 560 in 1911. The names of the various places where the deaths occurred will be found in columns 2 and 3 at foot of Table I. of Appendix.

"The age and sex distribution of the population of England and Wales being taken as a standard to all communities within their borders, the death-rates of different localities can be calculated on the assumption that they have the same proportion of children under 5, old people, and women as have the population of England and Wales. By thus eliminating this disturbing factor of age and sex distribution different communities can be brought into strict comparison with one another. "In 1883 the Registrar-General commenced a method of correcting the death-rates of the great towns of England and Wales. Taking account of the differences of age and sex distribution between these and the latter, he has calculated a factor for each great town by which the recorded death-rate must be multiplied so as to allow for the differences of age and sex, and thus places them as regards these matters on an equal footing. You thus get death-rates the difference in which we can put down to general sanitary conditions alone. In illustration of this I have taken the above figures from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary for 1912 to form Table E. "It will be seen from this that in London and the Boroughs the correction raises the death-rate, showing that there is in them a preponderance of people living at ages when the death-rate is low (viz., between 5 and 50), and also of women, sufficient to keep the recorded death-rate down, notwithstanding the great number of children under 5."

Although infants suffer considerably from pulmonary diseases in winter, there is no doubt that the warm season is much the most dangerous, and it is during this time of year that hundreds are swept away by diarrhœal diseases. If it were not for these the infantile mortality would soon fall to a minimum with little variation from year to year. An examination of the above table in conjunction with table H will illustrate my remarks. In the summer of 1912, the weekly average temperature of the air was 55.23 and in 1913 it was 58.2 and the weekly number of deaths from diarrhœa during the same period was double in 1913 to what it was in 1912. Diarrhœa is a disease which is liable to be conveyed from child to child, and is no doubt due to contamination of food. The opinion is now becoming prevalent that this contamination which is mostly in the shape of micro-organisms is bourne by flies. At the time of writing, the Council have issued a handbill which will be distributed to every house in the Borough on the importance of the destruction of flies and a detailed report will be given on the subject in the next annual report.

This gives a zymotic death-rate of 2.56. The total number of deaths from notifiable diseases, viz., scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhus fever, and enteric fever, was 23, compared with 31 in 1912, and for the non-notifiable, viz., measles, whooping cough, and diarrhœa, 297 compared with 221 in the previous year. Senile Mortality. The number of deaths over 65 years of age in 1913 was 504, compared with 516 in 1912. Death Certification. There were no uncertified deaths in 1913. Small-pox. There were no deaths from this cause in 1913. Measles. There were 88 deaths due to this disease, which is 11 below the average for the last ten years, and 13 below the number for 1912. The deaths occurred in quarters as follows, viz. :-29, 43,13, 3. Diarrhœa. Table H shows the connection between the meteorological conditions and deaths from this disease. The most important factor in the prevention of diarrhœa is undoubtedly breast-feeding. If young children are breast-fed and given reasonable care, their chances of life are four or five times, and according to some authorities ten times, as great as children artificially fed, even when this is done under favourable conditions. 17 TABLE H.

The deaths occurred in quarters as follows :—13, 29, 5, 0. Typhus Fever. No deaths occurred from this disease. Enteric Fever. 2 deaths were due to this cause, both in Rotherhithe. The corresponding figures for 1912 were 5 for the Borough, viz., 3 in Bermondsey, 1 in Rotherhithe, and 1 in St. Olave. Tubercular Diseases. The number of deaths from all forms of tubercular disease in 1913 was 277, against 299 in 1912. This figure comprises 180 for Bermondsey, 80 for Rotherhithe, and 17 for St. Olave. Of these, 201 were due to phthisis and 76 to the other tubercular diseases. B Phthisis. In Table J will be found particulars of deaths from phthisis since the year 1903. There were 201 deaths due to this cause, which is 11 less than the number recorded in the previous year. TABLE J.—PHTHISIS. Sub-District Bermondsey. Rotherhithe Whole Borough London. St. Olave.

There are two causes at work to produce this, first the immunity which is being acquired owing to the gradual elimination of unhealthy stocks, and second the various sanitary measures which have been recently put in force. How much is due to each it is impossible to say. Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver. 22 deaths were attributed to this cause in 1913, against 20 in 1912. This number gives a very small idea of the deaths caused by these diseases, since they are often the remote causes of death, and are not always mentioned on the certificate for various reasons. Cancer. 138 deaths were attributed to this cause. The Cancer Research Commission have not yet issued their final report on the subject. Heart Diseases. 178 deaths were due to this cause, which number is 4 above that for the previous year. This refers to organic or valvular disease of the heart. Suicides. 13 persons committed suicide in 1913, viz., 4 by poison, 6 by hanging or strangulation and 3 by drowning. Accidents. 78 deaths were due to accidents, against 96 in the previous year. Particulars will be found in the extended table of the Causes of Death in the Appendix. Other Violent Causes. There was no death by homicide during the year under report. B1 19 II.—NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In Table 111. of Appendix will be found particulars of infectious diseases notified during the year under report. The number of cases notified exclusive of notification of phthisis which numbered 760 was 1193, compared with 896 in 1912 and 943 in 191 1. The diseases which show a decrease on the number for the previous year are erysipelas (40), typhoid fever (8), ophthalmia neonatorum (18), puerperal fever (6), acute polio-myelitis or acute polio-encephalitis (6), membranous croup (3), while those showing an increase are scarlet fever (321), diphtheria (34). The number of cases notified in the registration sub-districts was 800 in Bermondsey against 598 in 1912, 339 in Rotherhithe against 238, and 54 in St. Olave against 60 in 1912. The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 9.6, the rate for the sub-districts being 9.8 for Bermondsey, 9.8 for Rotherhithe, and 6.2 for St. Olave. The corresponding rates in the previous year were 7.1 for the Borough, 7.3 for Bermondsey, 6.9 for Rotherhithe, and 7.0 for St. Olave. 33 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from the disease for which they were notified, but if allowance is made for mild unreported cases, the recorded notifications would, if anything, understate the actual number of cases. Small-pox. No cases were notified during the year under report. Typhus Fever. One case of typhus fever was notified during the year under report. H.L. female, 20 years, of No. 15, Woolf Street, was notified on May 24th as suffering from typhoid fever, but, on removal to hospital the same day was found to be suffering from typhus fever and notified from the hospital accordingly. This disease has no connection with typhoid fever and 40 or 50 years ago was very prevalent in many of the large towns. It has, however, practically died out with the exception of Liverpool, in England and one or two places in Scotland and Ireland. Almost every year a single case occurs in London, but it does not seem to spread any further. The only serious outbreak we have had in Bermondsey was in 1903. I visited the patient in the hospital and found that the rash and many of the symptoms were typical of typhus, but there were one or two symptoms of this disease apparently absent. The most noticeable deviation was in the mental condition of the patient which with the exception of one day, was bright and clear. She recovered, but this did not take place as it generally does by crisis, i.e., the sudden falling of the temperature and an improvement of the symptoms about the fifteenth day of the disease, but by a gradual falling of the temperature and return of appetite. The usual precautions were taken, viz., prompt isolation, disinfection and subsequent observation of the " contacts " for three weeks. Diphtheria. There were 245 cases of diphtheria notified in 1913, of which 164 occurred in Bermondsey, 68 in Rotherhithe, and 13 in St. Olave. This is an increase on 1912, for which the figures were :— Borough, 211 ; Bermondsey, 137 ; Rotherhithe, 65 ; and St. Olave, 9. From the following table it will be seen that an increase has taken place throughout London. Cases of Diphtheria Notified. Year. London.

The attack-rate per thousand inhabitants was 1.96, against 1.68 in 1912. The case mortality was 6.5 per cent., against 8.1 per cent, in 1912 and 5.0 per cent, in 1911. 3 cases were returned as not suffering from this disease. 250 specimens were sent in by medical practitioners for bacteriological examination, against 223 in 1912 and 176 in 1911. Of these 44 were found to contain diphtheria bacilli, all of which were notified. In 1 case of diphtheria the source of infection was attributed to a previous case in the family. The following appeared in the report last year and gives an explanation of the method adopted in this Borough to prevent the spread of this disease. Diphtheria is a disease caused by a characteristic bacillus known as the Klebs-Löeffler Bacillus, which occurs in the throats of persons attacked by the disease. It seems to be conveyed from person to person by direct contact, and there is no virulent disease which will spread more rapidly under certain circumstances than this will among school children. It is more or less directly conveyed from throat to throat by children passing sweets, slate pencils, and other articles which they are liable to put in their mouths, from one child to another. Kissing an affected person on the mouth will also frequently give rise to the disease, and an infected child coughing in the neighbourhood of non-infected ones will also often transmit the disease to them. Sometimes the bacilli will exist in the throat for a long time without producing any symptoms, but such children, while not suffering themselves, will be liable to convey the infection to others. For this reason they have been called " carrier " cases, and, as expressed in previous reports, my belief is that a large part of the spread of the disease is due to such cases. Since 1902 an endeavour has been made in this Borough to prevent any of these "carrier" cases returning to school, and each Annual Report has contained some account of the working of the plan. This consists in getting the parents of a child which is notified as suffering from diphtheria to bring up the other members of the family within Notifications 1913 marked Red. DIPHTHERIA. Average 10 years 1903-1912 marked Green Notifications 1313 marked Red ENTERIC FEVER. Avera ge 10 years 1903 1912 marked Green SCARLET FEVER. Notifications 1913 marked Reo. Average 10 years 1903-1912 marked Green. a week or so after the removal or recovery of the case to the municipal laboratory at the Town Hall for examination. If diphtheria bacilli are found in the throats they are excluded from school for a fortnight, and if then found to be free, are allowed to return to school. The number of children thus examined in 1913 was 352, belonging to 145 families. Out of this number 8 had diphtheria bacilli in their throats or noses, 4 of whom developed the clinical symptons of diphtheria, and were therefore notified. Scarlet Fever. The notifications of scarlet fever in 1913 were practically double those for 1912. This result is not altogether unanticipated, as reference to the report for 1912 will show. Scarlet fever like other infections diseases has a tendency to rise and fall at intervals of certain numbers of years and we are evidently on the upgrade again. The causes of these prevalences are not fully known but an increase of susceptible material among the population is probably the most potent cause. Fortunately the type is very mild and attended with a low death rate. This very mildness has no doubt conduced to some extent to the prevalence since cases are very liable to be overlooked. There were 732 cases notified—503 for Bermondsey, 206 for Rotherhithe, and 23 for St. Olave. This is an increase of 321 for the Borough on the total for 1912. The distribution of the disease in the various Wards, as shown in Table III. of Appendix, was fairly uniform. 25 cases were returned from hospital as not suffering from scarlet fever. The accompanying chart shows the prevalence of the disease in each of the 52 weeks under report. The average notifications for the past ten years are shown in green. There were 5 deaths, which gives a case mortality of 0.68 per cent., against 1.9 per cent, in 1912. The disease, as in recent years was of a mild type. The attack rate per thousand inhabitants was 5.9, against 3.3 in 1912. In 62 cases the source of infection was attributed as follow:— Previous cases in house or family or neighbouring houses 26 School infection 23 " Return " cases 13 In the 13 cases classified as " return " cases the source of infection was some other member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attck of scarlet fever within a fortnight previous to the second case occurring, in this case the source of infection in the second case is presumed to be the child recently returned from hospital. The following statement on the subject is reprinted from my Annual Report for 1 907 :- " A good deal of attention has been given to these so-called " return " cases on the part of the laity, and also by medical authorities, the former generally being inclined to attribute it to premature discharge from the infectious disease hospital. As stated, however, in previous reports, facts do not support this view, because in the first place the cases are very few compared with the number discharged, and it is second cases classified as " return " cases the source of infection was some other member of the family or occupant of the same house who had returned from hospital after an attck of scarlet fever within a fortnight previous to the second case occurring, in this case the source of infection in the second case is presumed to be the child recently returned from hospital. The following statement on the subject is reprinted from my Annual Report for 1 907 :- " A good deal of attention has been given to these so-called " return " cases on the part of the laity, and also by medical authorities, and in the second case it is sometimes those children who are detained months over the usual time and that cannot be considered to have been prematurely discharged who produce the disease. " The micro-organism which produces scarlet fever has yet to be discovered, and the probability is that when this is made it will be found it behaves in a somewhat similar manner to diphtheria, and will be found to exist in the noses and throats of the patients who either have not got the disease at all, or who have recovered from an attack some considerable time previously. Those patients who have suffered from complications leading to pathological discharges from nose, throat and ears are more liable to spread the disease than simple, uncomplicated cases." Measles. The number of deaths for 1913 was 88, against 101 in 1912, 51 in 1911 and 143 in 1910. The annexed table gives the number of notifications received from schools, the number of " contacts " excluded. In the first quarter there were 29 deaths, in the second 43, in the third 13, and in the fourth 3. This disease is subject to considerable fluctuations, and as practically every child gets it it depends largely on the number of susceptible children and the number of foci in a district which start the infection. As remarked in my previous report, there is no doubt that the infants' departments of the schools are very largely responsible for the spread of this disease, though the London County Council's regulations, of which the following is a copy, are strictly carried out : (1) Senior Departments — (a) If a child has had measles it need not be excluded from attendance at school. ( b) If a child has not had measles it should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. (2) Infants' Departments — All children should be excluded from attendance at school until Monday following 14 days from the commencement of the illness of the last case in the house. Enteric Fever. 26 cases of enteric fever were notified, being 13 for Bermondsey, 8 for Rotherhithe, and 5 for St. Olave. 5 cases were returned as not suffering, making an actual total of 21. The total number of cases notified in the previous year was 34. Puerperal Fever. 13 cases of puerperal fever were notified. There were 3 deaths. Membranous Croup. No notification of this disease was received during the year under report. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. There were 24 cases of this disease notified during the year. Under this heading is included every kind of " sore eyes " occuring in the newly born. They were all visited by the Health Visitors, who instructed them to immediately seek medical advice. Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. Three cases of this disease were notified. In the first case the patient recovered completely, in the next the patient died in hospital and the last removed out of the borough and we have been unable to obtain any further information. The following paragraph printed in last year's annual report represents my views at present. Most of the cases diagnosed under this heading in London are cases of meningitis occurring in children and have been long known as " post-basic meningitis "or " Still's disease." They have always been with us, but as they are caused by a micro-organism which resembles that causing the disease known as cerebro-spinal fever, which occurs in outbreaks, it was thought advisable by the London County Council to include them under the term " cerebro-spinal fever." Dr. T. Houston, of Belfast, who has had an opportunity of investing a large outbreak which occurred there in 1911 and 1912, is of opinion that the micro-organisms of the two diseases, although belonging to the same group, are fundamentally different and give rise to different diseases, and with this view, on present evidence I am inclined to agree. The cases notified in Bermondsey gave rise to no other cases, but disinfection and isolation were carried out. Acute Polio-Myelitis. Three cases of this disease were notified during the year under report. The disease is commonly known as infantile paralysis and is a very common cause of deformities of the arms or legs seen in adults. It frequently takes the form of an arm or leg ceasing to grow and on enquiry one finds it came on in childhood. The disease is an infection of parts of the interior of the spinal cord and exists in two forms, viz. : sporadic when odd cases occur about a district and do not spread and epidemic form when several cases occur together and seem to be connected with one another. The above three cases may be described as sporadic. It is not so fatal as cerebro-spinal meningitis, but it is more liable to leave paralytic conditions behind. All three cases recovered but there was some paralysis of the limbs left. The cases have been kept under observation but show no signs of spreading. The organism causing the disease is not known.

F „ 16th A.M. ,, 10th Married sister to first patient, helped to nurse him and mother, died at St. Thomas' Hospital. 30 years E.H.R.'s illness began with what was considered an ordinary attack of influenza, but on February 27th he developed acute pneumonia and was obliged to take to bed. He then gradually got worse and died on March 4th. During his illness he was nursed by his mother and sisters. The next person to be taken ill was the mother, but she had a weak chest and was undoubtedly a susceptible person, and the next two patients were probably rendered susceptible by want of proper rest while nursing the brother and mother. Pneumonia is caused by a micro-organism, and in the ordinary way is only slightly infectious ; but as in the above family the type seems from unknown causes to occasionally become virulent and spread to those in close contact with the patient especially if they are not careful to prevent spread of infection by means of drinking vessels, handkerchiefs, etc. That close contact and susceptibility both played a part in its spread is shown by the fact that some five other members of the family and two strangers were more or less constantly in attendance on the patients remained in good health. Four fatal cases of pneumonia occurred among a family belonging to the Borough, as follow : — Pneumonia Children excluded from School on account of Infectious Diseases. School. Total Exclusions.

This must be considered a very satisfactory result considering that we were not able to get hold of the best cases from a sanatorium point of view. The majority of suitable cases were unwilling to leave their work as they had no method of supporting their families. The greatest difficulty one has to deal with is the after care of consumptives, and until there is some organisation whereby suitable work can be found for patients on leaving the sanatorium a great deal of the money spent on this treatment will be wasted.

No summonses were taken out under the London County Council's bye-laws for carriage of offensive matter through streets in unsuitable receptacles and during prohibited hours, during the year under report.

Ashdown. Unsound Food and Foreign Meat Regulations. In reviewing the operations under the above, in this district, I find that in the majority of cases the quantity of goods landed is greater than in the previous year, consequently the labour of the department, both clerical and inspectorial, has been heavier. No alterations to the regulations have come into operation during the period under report, and no additional " Official Certificates," relative to foreign meats, have been declared admissible. The quality of the bacon, which is principally Siberian or Russian, is still improving. Landings of Siberian in this district have increased from about 73,000 parcels in 1912 to about 108,000 this year; the quantity seized has been small. Beef, Queensland Frozen. The quantity handled has been above the average, but only a very small percentage is now found infested with the worm nests. Beef tongues have again caused considerable trouble, as they come in ostensibly as "short cuts," some of which show glands and others completely without them. These are examined individually, and it will be seen that over 3,000 were found diseased, or unsound and seized. Once more I express regret the regulations have not been amended so as to deal more effectively with this line of goods. Beef Offal. Only a very small quantity reached this district unexamined by some other waterside authority. Butter. Only three lots, about 154 tons, have been dealt with under the regulations. Coffee. Some official decision as to what is unfit seems necessary, as it appears the prevailing view held by the trade is that coffee, no matter in what condition, can again be made fit, market value being almost the only consideration. Eggs. The imports have increased from about 300,000 cases in 1912 to about 377,000 cases this year. The same rules have been adhered to with regard to sorting, etc., and continue to work satisfactorily. It will be seen that, including seizures, collections from sorting places and warehouses, about go tons have been destroyed. Peels in Brine. An attempt has been made to deal more efficiently with this commodity. The waste on the imports is now large, principally caused by unsuitable packing, the casks used being too fragile for the weight they contain are easily damaged, and the brine escapes in transit. Pork. In carcase the quantity landed has been very small, but tongues continue to arrive from Siberia or Russia, and slill in a very unsatisfactory condition. A large percentage, on arrival, has no portion of the lymphatic glands left, others only small portions, and including these in the bulk, about 5 per cent. have been found diseased. I think it should be mentioned that these tongues come from the same ports, by the same ships, and to the same consignees as a fair quantity of the bacon. Soft Fruit and Vegetables. The quantities landed in the district have been considerably below the average, but the quality fair and the seizures and stoppages small. Customs Authority. The ever-ready and valuable assistance rendered by the Customs Officers is deserving of the warmest thanks. DESTRUCTION OF TINNED GOODS. The following report on the destruction of tinned goods was made to the Council and they decided to have all tins pricked and put into the destructor. "Owing to the alteration in the method of disposal of some of the refuse in Bermondsey, we find it very difficult to get rid of rejected tins of food, of which we receive a very large quantity for destruction. Up to quite recently these were pricked under the supervision of one of the wharves inspectors, soaked in disinfectant, and put into barges, by which they were transported out of reach of persons who rake over rubbish heaps. A few days ago a large quantity of tins were collected from a firm in this Borough by a van from the Surveyor's Department and deposited on a piece of vacant ground off Trundleys Road, Deptford. They were only covered with a light layer of earth, and no doubt would have been an attraction to a certain class as soon as their whereabouts was discovered. A man was sent down immediately it came to our knowledge, who pricked them so they could not be used again. It seems to me the proper way to destroy this stuff is to prick the tins and then put them in the destroyer, but as one of the principal functions of this is to raise steam there is an objection to putting them into the furnaces from an engineering point of view. There are two alternatives to putting them in the destructor, the first is to let them go to the new "tip" after they are thoroughly pricked and soaked in disinfectant. After deposit they should then be covered with two or three feet of earth; the other method would be to open the tins and empty out the contents. This is the next best method to burning, but both of these, especially the emptying of the tins, are going to cost considerably more than putting them in the destructor." Inspections. In Table XII. of Appendix will be found particulars of the general sanitary work by the District Inspectors during 1913, and in Table IX. the number of premises on the Registers to which special attention has been paid. The house-to-house inspections number 4,270. This is 50 above the total for the previous year, and is an average of 534 per Inspector, against 528 in 1912. 4,829 intimation notices were served, compared with 4,592 and 1,273 statutories, against 1,160 in the previous year.

Food and Drugs. In Tables XIII. and XIV. of Appendix will be found a list of the samples taken in 1913, and the action taken; 1,193 samples were taken, compared with 1,175 in 1912 and 1,214 in 1911. Of these 14.7 per cent. were found adulterated, compared with 8.1 per cent. in the previous year and 11.4 per cent. in 1911. The most notable feature of the analysis of samples of this and recent years is the number of adulterations of milk which show the addition of small percentages of water, ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 per cent. This is due to the present standard which requires 8 per cent, of fat and 8.5 per cent. of non-fatty solids. Magistrates and others are liable to forget that this so-called "standard" represents the lowest limit below which milk must not go. The vast majority of natural milks show considerably higher figures, and the result is that the samples are watered down so as to be as near as possible this "standard" and the small percentages show that they occasionally overstep the mark. Sixteen per cent. is the amount of water allowed in butter, and it is astonishing how closely manufacturers keep to this amount, but occasionally they also overstep the mark, but even this small percentage beyond the legal limit is very beneficial to the trader if undetected, since he can make a very large profit out of 1 percent. In the accompanying table will be seen the percentages of milk fat in the various samples of milk. Year. Milk Fat. Total Samples.

Ten were pulled down under the Housing and Town Planning Act, making a total of 218. These were visited quarterly in accordance with the instructions of the Public Health Committee. 117 notices were served, 10 of these being for overcrowding.

The following table shows the number of articles passed through the steam disinfector during the year under report: — Beds 1,0 66 Quilts 1,126 Blankets 1,350 Sheets 1,338 Bolsters 750 Books 514 Miscellaneous 5,897 Carpets 34 Verminous Clothing 22,734 Cushions 421 Mattresses 738 Overlays 447 Total 38,467 Pillows 1,902 19,242 new tabs were used to replace those taken off mattresses, palliases, and cushions before disinfection. Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. During the year under report 31 male adults, 4 female adults, 1,362 male and 1,287 female children used the Verminous Baths and had their clothing disinfected. The total number of articles disinfected for this purpose was 22,734. Smoke Nuisances. 45 chimneys were kept under observation and 14 notices served. House Refuse. The following table shows the amount of house and trade refuse disposed of during the year ended December, 1913 :— House Refuse — Bermondsey Destructor 11,143 loads. 17,162 19 0 Barged away 185 „ 284 19 0 Total 11,328 17,447 18 0 Trade Refuse — Bermondsey Destructor 1,470 loads. 1,365 16 0 Barged away 626 „ 581 12 0 Total 2,096 1,947 8 0 Offensive Trades. The offensive trades on the Register are as follow:— Tripe boiler 1 Glue and size makers 4 Fellmongers 3 Fat melters 4 Manure manufacturer 1 183 inspections were made, against 194 in 1912. 6 notices were served. The following report was made to the Public Health Committee and partly as a result of this and the report of their own Inspector, the L.C.C. successfully prosecuted the firm, getting an order that they must confine the business to the two arches originally registered. D I "Messrs. Freeland & Smith occupy nine railway arches which open on to a private road, the main entrance of which is in Southwark Park Road, in the neighbourhood of the "John Bull." Four of these arches belong to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, and five to the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. Two of the latter only, Nos. 13 and 14, are registered with the County Council for the manufacture of manure, which is an offensive trade. No. 13 is used as the main entrance of the business premises and also as an office, and No. 14 is intended to be a closed chamber as required by the by-laws for the carrying on of offensive processes. The remaining seven arches are mainly used for storing scutch (the residue from glue boiling), furriers' waste, feathers, "brown scum" (sugar waste), shoddy and various waste matters from maufactures. These are stated to be simply stored, bagged, and sent out just as received, that is, without undergoing any process which might be construed as the manufacture of manure. Some years ago the question was raised as to whether this firm had not established anew the business of a manure manufacturer within the meaning of the Act, inasmuch as they had increased their business by the storing of scutch in the large arch to be mixed with other matter in the closed chamber. The firm denied doing any mixing, and said the scutch was carted out as received. On January 16th, however, on visiting these premises in company with a London County Council Inspector, we made a complete inspection, and, among other things detailed below, found that the firm were actually mixing scutch along with other waste products in the closed chamber, and it was evident to us that the scutch stored in the large arch above referred to was being used for the purpose of the manufacture of manure. There were machines in some of the other arches apparently used for breaking up matter, but we could not say they were being used in the closed chamber. The closed chamber does not comply with the by-laws in the following respects: — (1) The paving was partly composed of stone setts, and not jointless. (2) There was no drainage and there was liquid lying about on the floor. (3) Walls were not of brickwork, but were partly of wood. (4) Chamber was not air-tight, but the smell could escape from the defects in the roof. (5) The window was not one-tenth of the floor area, and the glass did not appear to be one-eighth of an inch in thickness and was not properly protected. (6) The doors did not fit close and were not selfclosing. (7) There was no inlet fan, and the outlet fan, which is not a very good one, was not working. This latter is an offence which is punishable under the by-laws. (8) There was no cement rendering to a height of 6 ft. around the walls. As regards the arches generally, the paving was very defective and the floors in a filthy condition, and the arches generally dirty, some of them being worse than others. This firm are in the habit of standing carts for various periods, very often containing offensive matter, out in the road opposite the premises. I think they should be written to and formally requested to comply with the by-laws as to the structure of the premises. It is for the Committee to decide whether they should be prosecuted for the extension of the business above mentioned and for the breach of the by-laws in not having the extraction fan working. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. The following reports were submitted to the Council during the year under report and in each case Closing Orders under Section 17 of the above Act were made:- 2, 3 and 4, Clove Place. I beg to report the above houses for closing orders under Section 17 as being unfit for human habitation. The following are the main defects: Want of thorough ventilation on all floors; at present they are of the back-toback type. All the woodwork in the houses is old, dirty and dilapidated, the light and ventilation in the rooms and staircases defective, and dampness in the back walls, which are also dilapidated. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Cloyne Row. The above houses have been inspected in accordance with Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, to ascertain whether they are in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. The following is the result of the inspection:—They are small two-storied cottages, each containing 3 rooms and a wash-house. They abut on a pathway, 4 ft. 6 ins. wide, which leads from the bottom of New Church Street into Loftie Street. As, however, there are no high buildings opposite there is little obstruction to the light. The back walls of the washhouses and back rooms, first floor, are very close to the wall of a large warehouse, which completely blocks out light and ventilation. The yards, which are situated at the side of the washhouse, have a superficial area of about 8 sq. ft., but as half of this is taken up by the w.c's., the actual area of the open yard is about 4 sq. ft. The water-tap is placed here, with the result that the surrounding walls are in a chronic state of dampness owing to the splashing of the tap water. The w.c's. are very small, dark, damp, badly ventilated and dirty. The back ground floor rooms, used as wash-houses, are very dark, dirty, damp and dilapidated ; there is a small window in the back wall, but this is close to the wall of the opposite warehouse, so that very little light penetrates. The walls of the ground floor front rooms are in most cases match-boarded, probably to hide the damp. In four of the houses the walls showed dampness above this. The light of these rooms is fairly good, but the air, which comes from the yard and the damp dirty wash-houses, can neither be wholesome not sufficient. In the front rooms first floor the lighting is good and the ventilation is passable, but as the back rooms are in such bad condition they must interfere considerably with the purity of the air. The back rooms first floor are extremely small and have a cubic capacity of a little over 300 ft.; they are very dark, and dilapidated, and the damp, which is very bad, affects not only the back walls but also the ceilings in most of the cases. With one exception they are all used as bedrooms, and it would be difficult to conceive a more unsuitable room for the purpose. The cubic capacity is sufficient for one person only, but in many cases there were over this number. The staircases are narrow, winding, and dark, and as the treads themselves are very narrow they seem to me to be very dangerous. Several of the rooms are verminous. The general state of repair is bad, and in some cases the woodwork might be described as old, dirty, and dilapidated. In consideration of the general structure, position, and condition of the back portions of these houses, I consider they are at present unfit for human habitation, and recommend the Council to serve notices to that effect under Section 17 of the above specified Act. Nos. 1-10, and 15-35. Wood Place, Grange Road (31 Houses). I beg to make a representation that the above dwelling houses are in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and recommend the Council to make Closing Orders under Section 17 of the above Act. The following are the reasons:- The houses, which are two and four roomed cottages, are situated in a small court approached by a narrow passage from Grange Road. On the south and east sides this court is closed in by buildings, 50 and 60 ft. high respectively, which prevent the proper access of light and air. On the north side the buildings, which form the boundary are about 35 ft. high and prevent ventilation to some extent. As regards the dwelling houses in the area; on the east side there are 11 houses facing one of these high buildings, and they are situated in a cul-de-sac 15 ft. 9 in. wide; those on the west side and in the centre of the area abut on a court 19 ft. wide, and though this court is not a complete cul-de-sac, for practical purposes it is little better since it is shut in by four dwelling houses at the south end and the only exit is a narrow circuitous passage 6 ft. wide. All the houses are old, dilapidated and worn out; the woodwork is old, dirty and dilapidated; the plaster on the walls on the inside is in the last stage of dilapidation, and is only prevented in many cases from crumbling away by being covered by cheap wall paper; the rooms are very dirty and verminous, and the yards are small and badly paved. The light and ventilation are more or less deficient in all the rooms, which in many cases are overcrowded. The inhabitants consist mostly of hawkers, costermongers, casual labourers and others whose habits are not very cleanly. A considerable amount of the food which is sold on the barrows in Tower Bridge Road is stored over night in these houses and therefore exposed to all sorts of filth and contamination. The death rate for the area for the last 10 years is 36 per thousand living inhabitants, which is almost double that of Bermondsey for the same period and considerably more than double that of Bermondsey for 1912. This area has given a great deal of trouble to the department during the past 12 years, and the only remedy consists in the radical treatment of it as a whole. Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, Nolan Place, Rotherhithe. I beg to make a representation that the above dwelling houses are in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and recommend the Council to make Closing Orders under Sec. 17 of the above Act. The following are the reasons: — These houses are situated in a small court, approached by a narrow entrance which passes underneath the first floor of No. 13 at the bottom of Hatteraick Street, Rotherhithe. The width of the court is 13 feet and as the houses opposite are about 16 feet high, the lower portions of the houses under representation are very dark. The back yards are small, the net areas of Nos. 10,11, 12 and 13 average 33 square feet, while that for No. 9 is 82 square feet. Nos. 9 and 10 are backto-back houses and their whole condition may be described as one of extreme dirt and dilapidation from roof to ground floor. They are verminous, and the ground floor rooms are very dark ; the staircases are dark, winding, rickety and dangerous. No. 10 is unoccupied. No. 11 is also unoccupied and is the last stage of dilapidation; the floors are partially up and the back of the roof is falling in. I consider these empty houses are a menace to the court. The back wall of No. 12 is very dilapidated and partly weatherboard; the roof is tiled, old and more or less liable to leak; The ground floor room is approached from the yard by a low narrow door, which is broken ; the room itself is very dark and the floor is a foot and half below the yard level and 3 inches below the street level. The staircase is old, rickety and dangerous and the top rooms are dirty and the woodwork in them is old, dirty and dilipadated. No. 13, as stated above, is partly built over the entrance to the court. The front door opens from this entrance into a small, very dark and badly ventilated living room; the scullery is very small and dark and the staircase and rooms generally are in a dilapidated condition especially the flooring. The back wall of this house is very dilapidated and partly weatherboard. There is one w.c. for Nos. 12 and 13, one for Nos. 10 and ii, and No. 9 has its own. The structure of walls and roof of the w.c.'s is very defective and dilapidated. There are various other defects which could be enumerated, but enough has been said to indicate the nature. Nos. 2, 3, and 4, Clove Place, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, Cloyne Row were made fit for human habitation, and the Closing Orders were determined. Demolition Orders were served on 1—10,1 —10, and 15 —35, Woods Place, and 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, Nolan Place. RAG FLOCK ACT. 4 samples were taken under the above Act. One sample of jute showed a very high percentage of impurities but no action was taken as the Town Clerk decided on the strength of a previous High Court case that this did not come under the definition of rag flocks. It has now been decided by the High Court that this material is rag flock with the result that the trade in it has been practically given up. Health Visitors.

The total number of births which took place in Bermondsey last year was 3,842, and of these 3,777 were notified under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. The difficulty referred to in earlier reports of getting the whole of the cases notified has to a large extent been overcome by the sending out to parents and doctors the special letters mentioned in my comments on this table for 1911. lam still of opinion that it would have been better had the time allowed for registration been shortened from six weeks to one, instead of having a special Act. An endeavour is now being made to hunt up delinquents, and a letter is being sent to the medical practitioners pointing out to them that it is their duty to inform the father of his duty under the Act, and that the medical man in attendance is not exempt unless he has reason to believe that someone else has notified. Of the 3,777 births notified, 2,653 received primary visits from the Health Visitors. The number of secondary visits was 230. Of this number 2,564 were breast fed, so that, with very few exceptions, breast feeding among the working classes in Bermondsey is the rule. This, however, only continues for a period of a month, or six weeks at furthest, after which period working mothers here find it necessary to supplement the meagre income by work of some description. Their infants are then left in charge of a stranger or some inexperienced member of the family, the result being they are artificially fed, and the wonder is that the infantile mortality is not much greater. It speaks well for the vitality of the infantile population that they survive the extraordinary methods of feeding to which some of them are subjected. Any enquiries into the subject of breast feeding and the best methods of ensuring its continuance will be incomplete if the economic conditions of the mothers is not taken into account. BABIES' CLASS. One part of the Health Visitor's work requires special mention, viz. : —The Babies' Class which is held in the Town Hall every Tuesday afternoon from 2.30 to 4.30. Mothers are encouraged to bring their children every week until they are a year old. They are regularly weighed and if the infants fail to progress favourably they are examined by myself and the mother advised as to suitable measures. Should these extend beyond such simple remedies as suitable diet or an ordinary aperient, the mother is advised to consult her usual medical attendant. In the case of poor people, they are given a card for the Evelina Hospital or the Children's Department of Guy's Hospital. The mothers take a great interest in the class and especially in the weekly gain in weight of the infants. They greatly appreciate the advice as to food and clothing given by the Health Visitors and myself, but we find it very difficult to overcome old prejudices and customs. As an example, immediately a baby is born, practically every mother in London buys a stiff binder about 4 inches broad made of some stiff webbing material. This is often bound round the body so tightly so that the baby as far as the trunk is concerned is swathed like a small Egyptian mummy. The result, naturally, is that the lungs and abdomen cannot expand properly and bronchitis and bowel troubles are the result. When objection is made to it we are generally informed that the baby must have a support to its back and our assurance that it is not necessary is generally received with polite incredulity. I am told that in the north of England these binders are unknown. The average attendance is 15, and it is greatly to be regretted that owing to lack of room and also time on the part of the Health Visitors the work cannot be extended. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. The question of a voluntary versus a municipal dispensary was very acutely debated in the autumn of 1913 and the spring of 1914, and it was finally decided under special agreement to contribute a sum of £200 to the Voluntary Dispensary and incorporate it to some extent with the work of the Public Health Department. Next annual report will contain an account of the working of this arrangement. Consultations. I was called in by medical practitioners to assist in the diagnosis of 7 cases of doubtful infectious disease. 75 children were examined at the request of school teachers, school nurses, parents, etc. I examined at the Town Hall 32 phthisis patients, 7 members of the Council's Staff and 22 candidates for appointments. Hairdressers and Barbers. At the end of 1913 eleven barbers were in possession of certificates. IV.—FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. In Table X. of the Appendix will be found particulars of the inspections of factories and workshops, and in the following table particulars regarding the trades and persons employed in connection with workshops. There were 322 workshops on the Register in 1913. Including bakehouses, of which there were 74 in use, the total is 396. OUTWORKERS. There were 584 outworkers on the Register at the end of 1913. 96 lists were sent in by firms in this Borough employing outworkers. Table X. of the Appendix shows the various trades followed by outworkers in this district. APPENDIX. APPENDIX.
