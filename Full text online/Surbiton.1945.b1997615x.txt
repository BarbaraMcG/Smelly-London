October, 1946. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am submitting my 24th Annual Report concerning the health of the Borough of Surbiton during the year 1945, and attached thereto is the Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector dealing with the work carried out by ho and his assistants. As will be seen from the following vital statistics, there is a falling off in the number of births and deaths, the respective rates being 17.27 and 10.58 compared with 18.45 and 12.44 for 1944. There is, however, an increase in the Infantile Mortality Pate, this being 34.28 against 29.68 for 1944. The demand for houses is still very great and this shortage no doubt leads to overcrowding with its consequent ill effects. During the year four houses were built by private builders, and ninety prefabricated bungalows were erected by the Council. I wish to thank all the members of my staff for their assistance during the past year.

The coincidence of Scarlet Fever has declined considerably, but the notified cases of Measles show a marked increase compared with the previous year. -8- TOTAL CASES NOTEflED TOTAL DEATHS At ages.

The continual movement of cases from one district to another requires constant supervision so that particulars may be brought up to date and represent a true record. At the end of the year 416 persons were shown to be suffering from the disease and living within the districts- Pul. Non. Pul.

Overcrowding is, no doubt, a contributory factor to the spread of the disease. Many patients are living with relatives or in lodgings in very cramped and unsatisfactory conditions, and this state of affairs cannot be remedied until houses are built in sufficiently large numbers. -10- Of the 96 cases tabulated overleaf, 20 cases are transferred from other districts. The table shows an increase comoared with last year of 21 pulmonary cases of tuberculosis, and the non-pulmonary cases show an increase of 5. The deaths show an increase of 6. At the commencement of the year there were 390 cases of tuberculosis on the register, and at the end of the year this figure had increased to 416. During the year 6 cases were notified as recovered from the disease, 30 patients left the district, there were 31 deaths, and 3 cases were notified as being non-tuberculous.

MASS RADIOGRAPHY SCHEME In November, 1945, the Surrey County Council Installed their Mass Radiography Unit at the County Hall, Kingston-onThames, for a few weeks, and an invitation to have an X-Ray photograph of the chest taken, was extended to staff ard workmen of the Corporation. The object of this scheme is to detect illness (particularly tuberculosis) in its early stages when treatment is easiest and most effective. I communicated with all Chief Officers asking them to bring the matter to the notice of their staffs. The response was most encouraging, and some 150 members of the staff indicated their desire to be X-Rayed. Appointments were made at the County Hall over a period of two weeks for the persons concerned, and the kind co-operation of all heads of departments in releasing their staff for these appointments wa3 very much appreciated.

In view of previous difficulties which the dairyman had had with his wholesale suppliers, the matter was referred to the Surrey County Council in whose area the vendor s premises are situated. -21- ICE CREAM. This commodity again appeared for sale to the public after a long absence. Eleven persons are registered by the Corporation for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream and fifty-three for storage and sale but not manufacture. All premises were inspected and everything possible done to ensure that a clean and wholesome article was offered for sale. It is unfortunate that no proper standards have been set up either for quality or cleanliness, and it is apparent that the authorities will have to give this subject early consideration. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. There are fortythree persons registered in accordance with the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, as follows:- Vholesale Traders or Producers of milk 7 Retail purveyors of milk residing in the district 28 Retail purveyors residing outside the district but retailing in the district 8 In consequence of the Rationalisation Scheme only thirteen retailers are now selling milk in the Borough, but the others have expressed a wish not to be removed from the register. Eight dealers' licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk, five to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk, two supplementary licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk and two to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk were granted under the Li Ik (special Designations) Order, 1936. Fortyfive samples of milk were taken for phosphatase test to ascertain if pasteurisation had been properly carried out. Fortythree were found to be satisfactory and two were insufficiently heat treated or were mixed with raw milk. These two samples were both from the same dairy which was situated in another Borough. The matter was taken up with the Sanitary Inspector concerned, and investigation revealed a leakage on the pasteurising plant. This was rectified, and subsequent samples were satisfactory. Six samples of milk were taken at farms for Methylene Blue, Coliform and Tuberculosis tests, the latter including animal inoculation. All were reported upon as being satisfactory. DISINFECTION . During the year disinfection was carried out at 11 civilian Premises in which the following diseases occurred:- Measles 5 Tuberculosis 6 Disinfection was also carried out at 26 premises after cases of non-notifiable diseases, the occupiers in each case paying the cost. -22- The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Isolation Hospital or destroyed was:- Disinfected. Destroyed. Beds 3 — Blankets 36 — Blinds 1 — Bolsters 9 — Cushions 11 — Mattresses 78 — Mattress covers 2 — Palliasncs 2 — Pillows 88 — Pillow cases 5 — Sheets 8 — Wearing apparel 40 — Miscellaneous 14 — Total: 297 Nil Number of rooms disinfected 11 Number of library bocks disinfected 89 ERADICATION OP BED BUGS. 1.

During the year 62 bodies were received into the mortuary, 62 post mortem examinations were carried out and 19 inquests were held. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. During the year 1,091 visits were made in connection with complaints of rats and/or mice. Inspections disclosed that 198 premises wire infested, of which number 74 were treated by the Corporation on payment, and advice was given in regard to the remaining 124. All the infestations were of a minor type with the exception of two, which were major (both Corporation properties) out were subsequently reduced to minors. The responsibility for disinfestation rests, by law, upon the occupiers of the premises, and a charge is always made when the corporation undertakes work at the request of occupiers. -23- RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION (Contd.) The scale approved "by the Town Council is 2/6d. per servicing visit which includes labour, transport, traps, poisons and "baits. Special terms are quoted for cases requiring long-term treatment. No charge is made for inspections and advisory visits. No progress could "be made with the treatment of sewers, as it was found impossible to obtain labour for such work. CIVIL AMBULANCE. With the winding up of the Civil Defence Organisation, the Corporation decided to place the civil ambulance under my control, and I took over this duty on 1st July, 1945. The vehicle in use is a 1934, 18 h.p. Talbot and one of the ex-civil defence ambulances has been acquired as a relief vehicle. The personnel consists of 2 drivers and 2 attendants working 24 hour shifts. The St.John Ambulance Brigade arranges for one of its members to be in attendance each evening to assist the permanent staff, a service which is very much appreciated. During the six months to 31st December, 1945, 181 accident and 273 private cases were dealt with. BUILDING LICENCES. During the year 225 applications for building licences were dealt with in my Department. CONCLUSION. This year saw the victorious termination of the wars in Europe and Asia, and the beginning of a return to peacetime activities. During the Summer, the staff was engaged for several months on the Scheme for bringing home the evacuees. Towards the end of the year some of the personnel of the Department who had been away in the Services began to come back, but I was unfortunately absent on sick leave for several months. I feel that the foregoing report giving details of work carried out during a rather exacting year, indicates that the Department has coped successfully with the manifold duties it was called upon to perform, and I am confident that when the staff is again built up to full strength, it will be competent to neet all demands made in the difficult days which lie ahead. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing thanks not only to my own staff but to my colleagues ir all DepartmentS for th ir help and co-c eration. I am, ladies and gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEOFFREY McCLELLA D. Chief Sanitary Inspector. -21-
