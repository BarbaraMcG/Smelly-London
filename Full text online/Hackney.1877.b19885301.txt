Board of Works for the Hackney District. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE HACKNEY DISTRICT, For the year, 1877, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., L.R.C.P.E., ETC., Hon. Sec., of the Meteorological Society, &c. AUTHOR OF NUMEROUS ESSAYS ON SANITARY STATISTICS, AND OTHER SUBJECTS. Medical Officer of Health for the District LONDON: A. T. ROBERTS, SON, & CO., STEAM PRINTERS, 5, HACKNEY ROAD. 1878 HAC 57 SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1877. Sanitary Offices, Town Hall, hackney, 10th May, 1878. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The continued prevalence of Small Pox, not only in this district but in all London, is one of the most marked events of the year as regards our mortality statistics, for otherwise, the year 1877 would have been characterised by the smallest death-rate recorded in this district since 1845, indeed as it is, the mortality was unusually small, having been below the average of the 10 years 1861-70. If this district had not suffered to a greater extent than all London, there would not have been much cause for surprise, although there would have been for regret at this disease having again appeared in our midst, as its tendency to recur in an epidemic form once in four years in this metropolis is so marked as to have almost induced an expectation of a considerable mortality in 1875, when the number of deaths was very much below the usual minimum. Indeed, the severe epidemic of 1871-72 appears to have so modified the usual course of the disease as to have postponed the outbreak for two years, as is shown by the table of deaths in all London from 1840 to 1877 inclusive. It may be asked,—if the tendency of this disease to assume an epidemic form at regular intervals be so marked, what is the good of isolation, disinfection, and other sanitary measures for preventing its spread ? One answer is, that by diminishing the number of cases at a given place is to diminish the intensity of the virus, so that many who would contract the disease when the poison is of a given 4 intensity, escape when it is very much diluted with fresh air. It is also probable that the large proportionate number of deaths to attacks, and the frequent occurrence of the hemorrhagic form, which is very fatal, is due to the greater intensity of the virus at epidemic periods. These remarks apply not only to Small Pox, but to Measles, Scarlet Fever, and Whooping Cough. Table I. Mortality in London from Small Pox 1840-77. Years. Deaths. Years. Deaths. Years. Deaths. Years.

In my last report I dwelt at some length on the protection afforded against these epidemics by a second vaccination of every person above 15 years of age, and would strongly impress upon all the necessity for this trifling operation being repeated at that age, or if it should have been omitted, at whatever age the person may be up to 55 or 60 years of age. There is also another point which should receive attention, viz.: the re-vaccination of servants, as a large proportion of the adult cases removed to the Hospital from this district were servants. If heads of families would see that their servants are re-vaccinated as soon as they 5 enter upon their duties, a great check would be given to the extension of the disease. It is, however, much to be regretted that the Local Government Board has not taken some measures which would lead to a more general re-vaccination of adults. Thus, the present fee payable to the district vaccinators is so utterly inadequate to the trouble entailed by the re-vaccination of adults, that they can scarcely be expected to carry it out in an energetic manner. The comparative immunity of those who have four good vaccination marks shows that vaccination has not lost its protective power; but that the operation was performed at many of the public stations before 1872, and by some private medical practitioners in a comparatively ineffective manner. This is of course all the more reason for a general re-vaccination of all over 15 years of age, and of those between 7 and 15, who are not protected by a sufficient number of good marks. If this were done, I have but little doubt that cases of small pox would be comparatively rare, as the system of arm to arm vaccination is much more certain and effective than the old plan.

As soon as the cold weather set in the number of cases increased, although slowly, until November, when the cases and the deaths became much more numerous. The mortality in Hackney during the present *See my Annual Report for 1876 6 epidemic is nothing like that which happened in 1871-72, as there were 511 deaths in those years against 271 in 1876-77. It is true that the epidemic has not yet ceased, but I do not think it probable that anything near the mortality of 1871-72 will be reached before this one has passed away. The number of cases communicated to the Sanitary department is not to be taken as an absolute indication of the prevalence of the disease in different districts, as our information was chiefly obtained through the Relieving Officers, who kindly sent me notice of the cases removed to Hospitals, and for which I have to express my thanks; by weekly inspection of the books of the District Medical Officers; by applications at this office for the disinfection of rooms, bedding and clothing; and by the copies of Death Returns from the District Registrars. The number of cases in each of the different districts now given must not, therefore, be considered as anything more than an approximative statement of the deaths amongst all classes, and of the cases which recovered amongst servants and the poorer classes, but the table shows a singular exemption of the inhabitants of De Beauvoir Town, Stoke Newington, Kingsland, West Hackney, and Stamford Hill, in fact of the western half of the district. This is the more peculiar as parts of Islington which adjoins our western boundary suffered severely. The inhabitants of the eastern and especially of the poorer parts of our district have again suffered severely, including however those on the Priory Estate, Lower Clapton, and in other better class streets in South Hackney and Hackney proper. Why the inhabitants of the Priory should have suffered so severely I cannot tell, unless it be through the agency of the children attending the Board School, as a number of the children go there, although I should have thought they are of a class above that for which these schools were provided. 7 No. of Cases from Small Pox reported in the following Sub-Divisions, 1877.

Cases. 95 101 167 21 60 4 20 22 112 61 7 670 The record of the number of cases treated at home and in Hospitals is not quite complete, but our books show that out of a total of 670 cases as many as 322 were removed to Hospitals, almost entirely to those belonging to the District Asylum Board and that 295 were treated at home. The Sanitary department was called on to remove only a few cases, and we succeeded in all but one in inducing those who were without proper lodging and accommodation to go to a Hospital. We also assisted in the removal of several cases to the Highgate Hospital of persons whose friends paid for their admission and treatment. In the one case in which the friends of a patient prevented his removal under a Magistrate's order, we summoned the persons who resisted us, and obtained penalties amounting to £1 0s. 0d. from each person and costs. A table shewing the streets in which most of the cases occured will be found in the appendix to this report. The appended summary shows that the disinfection of infected clothing and houses has been actively carried out, as no less than 1001 houses, or rather the infected rooms in that number of houses, have been disinfected by the Officers of the Board with burning sulphur. There were also 6237 articles of clothing, bedding, &c., disinfected, viz.: 545 beds, 179 mattrasses, 86 palliasses, 383 bolsters, 925 pillows, 865 blankets, 555 sheets, 395 quilts, and 2304 other articles, including articles of wearing 8 apparel, carpets and curtains. The results of the disinfection were very satisfactory, as in no instance did a case occur in the same rooms after disinfection, with the exception of a few cases where a patient sickened within 14 days after the disinfected articles were returned, so that it is almost certain they were infected before the return of the articles, as Small Pox has an incubative period of from 12 to 14 days. In some houses let in separate tenements, other cases happened some time (months) afterwards, and in different rooms, from fresh infection. This return includes the disinfections done for Scarlet Fever and a few cases of Typhoid and all the cases of Typhus, for which I have not deemed it necessary to make a separate return.

The cost of labour was £127 13s. 6d., and would have been more if the men engaged had not been put to other work when not employed in disinfecting. The coal and coke cost £16 5s. 4d.; repairs to the disinfecting chamber, £17 10s. 0d.; new wheels and repairs at different times to the covered truck, &c. £5 14s. 6d.; for disinfectants, £85 14s. 0d., which, however, includes those used for disinfecting drains and gullies ; and £7 11s. 3d. for petty expenses, making a total of £132 15s. Id. Against this outlay we have to place a sum of £36 17s. 6d. paid by persons who were in a position to defray the cost of disinfecting their beds, bedding, and other articles, leaving a nett outlay of £95 17s. 7d. to be charged on the rates. 9 One groat use of having a disinfecting chamber is, that we receive notice after the recovery of a patient of the occurrence of infectious diseases in private families, when we should not otherwise be informed of them, for we scarcely ever hear of cases occurring in the private practice of Medical practitioners except by accident, from neighbours, or, as above stated, after recovery. This is much to be regretted, especially in cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid, as they so frequently arise from some imperfection in the drainage, whereby sewer gas is either brought into the house or conveyed into the cisterns. Having thus briefly discussed the statistics of the Small Pox epidemic, I shall now lay before you, as usual, the various statistics and other matters connected with the sanitary condition of the district. The next table being one which shows the estimated population for the 10 years 1868-77, the density of population per acre; the number of births, deaths, and marriages; as well as of births to each 1000 of the population.

The increase in the number of residents in Stoke Newington is still very large, as the fields are rapidly being built on, and the houses occupied almost as fast as built. The density of population per acre in the whole district is also increasing, and is really greater than represented in the table, as out of 3935 acres there are 467 acres of open spaces which cannot be built upon, and 101 acres of water; but it is an undoubted advantage to have open spaces in our midst which cannot be built on in future years. The density of population in some parts of the district is very high, for instance at Hackney "Wick, in 1876, there were above 2100 inhabitants residing on 10 acres of ground, which would give 210 persons per acre, and in some parts of the district the number per acre must be still greater. The mortality at Hackney Wick was very high in 1876 and 1877, partly from the number of deaths from Small Pox, but chiefly from other diseases, as in the former year the death rate was 37.3 per 1000 inhabitants, and in the latter year 32.9 per 1000, or excluding Small Pox it was 28.3 in 1876, and 26.9 in 1877. In Hackney district the death rate for 1876, including the deaths from Small Pox, was 18.5, and excluding these deaths 17.8, and for 1877 the death-rate from all causes was 19.4, and excluding small pox deaths was 18.2 per 1000 inhabitants. I do not attribute this large mortality to one cause, but believe it arose from several, such as the great density of population, the comparative poverty of the people and want of comforts, as well as to a great extent from the bad foundations and bad construction of a large number of the houses, the low level of the ground, and the habits of many of the inhabitants by which drains get choked, and the houses are kept in a dirty state. I trust, however, when all the 11 streets are dedicated to the parish, and properly paved and drained, that the death-rate will be lessened by a reduction in the number of deaths of children from inflammatory diseases of the lungs, and other diseases which result from taking cold through wet feet. The regular scavengering of the streets should also improve the sanitary condition of this locality. Table III. 1877.—Births in each Sub-District. Quarters. Stoke Newington Stamford Hill.

It is, however, worth notice that the birth-rate for 1876 was the largest known, as it was in excess of any other decennial average by nearly 0.9 per 1000 population. The increase in the number of births in Stoke Newington still continues, as in 1871 there were were only 316 births registered; in 1873, 417; in 1S75, 519; and in 1877, 623, or nearly double the number for 1871. The per centage of births has also increased, having been in 1871 only 7.6 per cent. of the total registered in the district, whilst it was as high as 11.2 per cent. in 1877. The number of births in Stamford Hill district have increased since 1871, although the per centage has diminished, as there were 204 12 births in 1871, against 243 this year. The number of births is greater in each of the other districts, as in 1871 there were 971 registered in West Hackney, against 1267 in 1877 ; 1583 in Hackney, against 2047, and 1074 in South Hackney against 1375 ; but in spite of this excess the percentages have diminished in all except Stoke Newington. There were 3092 deaths of inhabitants registered during the year, against the 5555 births, giving an increase of population from the exccss of births amounting to 2463 persons, or about one-and-a-half per cent, on the total population.

The difficulty in calculating the death rates for the sub-districts is so great, not only because the Workhouse, the German Hospital, the City of London Unions, and the Fever and Small Pox Hospitals are in Hackney subdistrict, that I have not attempted to carry it out, but also because the rate of increase in the population of the sub-districts is not at all uniform, and I have no means of ascertaining what the additional numbers in each district are, as the registration districts do not correspond with the wards or the collectors' districts. There were 295 deaths registered in Stoke Newington, 18 127 in Stamford Hill, 587 in West Hackney, 1436 in Hackney, and 647 in South Hackney; against 165 in Stoke Newington, 100 in Stamford Hill, 613 in West Hackney, 1313 in Hackney, and 605 in South Hackney, in 1871. It is somewhat singular that although the births in West Hackney have considerably increased since 1871, yet the deaths have actually diminished from 631 to 587. It is true that the deaths in West Hackney were enormously high in 1871, as only 500 were registered in 1870, and 56S in 1872 against the 631 in 1871. Table V.

We find that although there have been 179 deaths of residents from this disease yet the deaths from zymotic diseases, as compared with those from all other causes, are positively fewer than in the 15 years from 1856 to 1871 when the per-centage was 21.2 against 20.3 in 1877, 22.2 in 1872, and 28.4 in 1871. This low rate arose from the unusually small number of deaths from Scarlet Fever and Diarrhoea in 1877. The deaths from constitutional diseases which include consumption and other similar affections, cancer, gout, &c., are rather fewer than usual, whilst deaths from local causes such as inflammatory diseases of the lungs, affections of the heart, liver, kidneys, &c., were higher than usual, as inflammatory diseases of the lungs were especially fatal in the early part of the year. In 1870 there were only 479 deaths from these diseases, and 547 in 1877. There were 70 deaths from cancer, 31 from mortification and abscess, 82 from mesenteric disease, 55 from water on the brain, and 337 from consumption. There were also 100 deaths registered from inflammation of the brain (cephalitis), of which as many as 31 were under 1 year old, and were therefore most probably due to a great extent to constitutional causes or to improper feeding; for there is no doubt that many of the deaths from cephalitis in children under 1 year are not inflammatory at all. Diseases of the heart were unusually fatal, as there were 215 registered this year against 186 in 1876, and 187 in 1875. There were also 139 registered from affections of the abdominal organs against 123 in 1876, whilst under the headings of premature birth and atrophy there was a decided diminution, viz. : only 181 against 205. The mortality from accidents was considerably larger, viz. : 100 against 69, which arose from an excess of deaths by drowning, viz.: 21 (of which the greater part were non-parishioners), 23 from fractures and contusions, 12 from burns and scalds. The percentage was, however, not much higher, viz.: 3.2 against 2.9, in consequence of the small number of these deaths as compared with those from all causes. 15 The deaths returned as resulting from old age were also very numerous, as 152 were registered against 116 in 1876. The ages at death varied but little from the average for the 10 years 1866-75, except between 15 and 25, and 55 and 66, when the mortality was greater. The death rate under 1 year was decidedly satisfactory as compared with 1876, when it was as high as 27.4 per cent. of the total deaths. In 1877 the per centages were as follows, under 1 year 24.4 per cent. of all the deaths, at 1-5 years 14.8, which is below the average of 1866-75, and much below that for 1856-65. And at the age period of 5-15 years the same remark applies, so that the percentage of deaths below 15 years of age was 44.2 in 1877, 43.5 in 1856-65, and 45.1 in 1866-75, which is fairly satisfactory. At 15-25 years of age the mortality was 6.2 per cent.; at 25-32, 7.2 per cent.; at 35-45, 7.0 per cent.; at 45-55, 7.1 per cent.; at 55-65, 9.1 per cent.; at 65-75, 9.5 per cent., which is rather below the average of former years; at 75-85, 7.6 per cent., which is also rather low; and above 85 years, 2.l per cent. The number of deaths at different ages at 80 and above are as follows—18 at 80 years, 18 at 81-82 years, 17 at 82-83 years, 14 at 83-84 years, 9 at 84-85 years, 14 at 85-86 years, 7 at 86-87, 9 at 87-88 years, and 6 at 89-90 years, making a total of 120 deaths of inhabitants above 80 but under 90 years of age. The numbers above 90 at different ages were 9 between 90-91, 4 between 91-92, 3 between 92-93, 2 between 93-94, 1 between 94-95, 2 between 95-96, 1 between 98-99, 1 between 99-100, and 1 at the very advanced age of 100 years and 13 days. This person, a female, was born on the 10th of September, 1777, and died on September 23rd. 1877, so that this is another undoubted case of the extension of life for a period exceeding 100 years. The proportion of deaths at 80 years of age and above, has been slightly diminishing since 1856 ; as in the ten years 1856-65, they amounted to 2.29; in 1866-75, 2.20; and in 1877, 2.10 per ccnt. of the total deaths. 16 Table VI.

This group is rather heterogeneous, as it includes not only the eruptive fevers, but remittent fever, rheumatism, influenza and quinsy. As, however, the mortality from these is small they may be almost dis-regarded. The death-rate from tubercular diseases was nearly the same as usual, having been 2.90 against 2.91 in 1876, but from inflammatory diseases of the lungs was in excess, having been 3.42 against 3.25 per 1000 population. From convulsive and wasting diseases of infants the death-rate was rather smaller, viz. : 2.00 against 2.24 per 1000. The toll levied on the human race by these diseases varies but little in this district from year to year, although as the density of the population increases we might expect a larger death-rate from most of the diseases included in the above list, except perhaps from inflammatory diseases of the lungs. table VII. 1867-1877.– Deaths from the principal Infectious Diseases And Diarrhœa–52 Weeks in Each Year. 1867 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872 1873 1874 1875 1876 Mean Temperature for ) each year. 48°6 51°6 49°5 48°7 48°7 50° 7 49°1 49°4 49°4 50°1 Small Pox 27 6 6 16 400 111 9 5 2 92 Measles 15 35 64 40 25 59 28 68 61 15 Scarlet Fever 49 49 247 181 85 51 27 97 78 57 Diphtheria 16 14 16 9 8 7 21 10 21 23 Whooping Cough,. 72 44 102 39 76 97 81 52 113 126 Fever 63 54 60 51 34 50 53 45 58 44 Diarrhœa 75 120 97 115 123 115 161 102 116 136 Totals—Hackney 317 320 592 451 751 490 380 379 449 493 Totals for London 11,660 14,638 17,413 16,476 19,455 12,729 11,170 11,230 13,411 12.565 Hackney Annual Average No. of Deaths. 1867-1876.

The death-rate per 10,000 population being 11.2 from small pox, 57 from measles, 3.6 from scarlet fever, l.1 from diphtheria, 2.7 from whooping cough, 3.9 from fever, and 5.4 from diarrhcea, being an excess for small pox and measles, but less than usual from scarlet fever, whooping cough, fever, and diarrhcea. The reduction, as regards scarlet fever and diarrhcea, being nearly one-half. The number of deaths from small-pox was the largest for any of the 10 years, with the exception of 1871, whilst that from diarrhoea, after allowing for increase of population, was less than in any of the other years included in the table. The mean number of deaths from these diseases, in the ten years 1867-76, was 36.3 per 10,000 inhabitants, and in 1877, only 33.6 per 10,000, which shows how little effect is produced in the death-rate from these diseases by the prevalence of one zymotic disease only. It is true that if we had had a hot summer the mortality from diarrhoea would have been greater, and the deathrate from these causes have been about the usual average. The mortality from whooping cough has fortunately declined, after two years of unusual prevalence and it is to be hoped that some years will elapse before such an epidemic occurs again. 19 Table VIII.

As regards the next class, those of uncertain seat, the range in the death-rate is singularly small, and the same may be said as to the tubercular affections which, I am glad to say, are gradually declining in the district. In 1856-65 the mean percentage of deaths from the causes B 2 20 which include consumption, water on the brain, tubercular diseases of the bowels and scrofula, was 16.77; in 1866-75, 16 52, and during the last two years 15.55 in each 100 deaths. Diseases of the nervous system which include inflammation of the brain, apoplexy, paralysis, insanity, &c., are slightly on the increase, the rate having been 12.18 in 1856-65, 12.09 in 1866-75, and 12.51 in 1871-77. The low average for the ten years 1860-75 was due to a singularly small number of deaths from these causes in several of the years. Diseases of the heart, as shown by the deaths, have considerably increased of late, although perhaps this may be partly due to more careful and accurate diagnosis in late years, and therefore more apparent than real. The same remark applies to inflammatory affections of the lungs and air passages which have increased from 16.39 in the ten years, 1856-65, to 17.94 in the seven years, 1871-77. Deaths from premature birth and atrophy have varied rather considerably, and were a little above the mean of any of the decennial periods. This is probably due to deaths hitherto assigned to " old age," being now certified as having been caused by heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and other ailments whose averages have increased. The deaths from violence are as nearly as possible the same as in 1866-75. 21 Table IX.

The deaths have also increased *The Annual Summary for London was not published in time for this Report, so that there are some blanks in this Table. 22 very considerably, but not in so great a ratio as the births, as the mean for 1841-51 was 946, for 1851-61,1,391, for 1861-71, 2,182, and for the seven years 1871-77, 2794. The proportion of births to each 100 deaths has increased from 146 in 1841-51 to 172 in 1871-77, showing a considerable change in the social condition of the people, viz. : that a larger population of the inhabitants are married now than were during the former period. The rate has of course altered, more from the varying number of deaths than of births, as for instance in 1871 when small pox, scarlatina, whooping cough and diarrhoea were very prevalent, and the deathrate was 22.4 per 1,000. There were only 149 births in 1871 to each 100 deaths, against 193 in 1876, when the death-rate was only 18.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. The proportion of births to inhabitants was only 28.3 per 1,000 in 1841-51, against 34.3 in 1871-77, but the rate has not altered much since 1863 when it was 33.9 per 1,000. The deaths under 1 year to each 100 registered births, which is a good criterion of the social position of the inhabitants, as well as of their sanitary condition, are as might have been expected more numerous now than in 1841-51/ when a larger proportion of the children were born to persons in a good position of life. I need not insert any tables on this subject, but from statistics that have been compiled by the Registrar-General we find that 10.3 deaths under 1 year occurred amongst those living in the so called healthy districts, i. e., sparsely populated country districts. From returns collected by Mr. Ansell, Jun., of the National Life Assurance Society, from the clerical, medical, and legal professions, we find that only 8.05 of these deaths occurred, against 16.56 which is the average for all England. It is, therefore, evident that inherited weakness and disease, improper feeding, neglect, bad sanitary conditions, and other causes induce a mortality amongst infants of double what it ought to be, and that our death-rate of 14.5 which is 2.0 below that for all England is still too high. In 1877 the rate was only 13.6 which is lower than in any year 23 since 1862, when it was only 10.9. The comparatively cold July and September, and the high mean temperature of November and December, account almost entirely for this reduced rate. The death-rate from all causes in Hackney was only 19.3 per 1,000 which is below the average for the seven years 1871-77, and of the ten years 1861-71, so that considering how rife small-pox has been amongst our inhabitants, we may congratulate ourselves on this return. The next point to which I desire to draw your attention is the diphtheria outbreak at Clapton, which, although it did not occur until early in 1878, yet as it excited considerable attention and discussion, I think it advisable to insert the report whioh I presented to the Board on the 22nd of March, 1878. "The first notification that I had of the outbreak was contained in a letter which I received concerning some cases at Warwick Road, and on making an inspection of these and other houses in which they occurred, it was found that in almost every instance a direct communication existed between their interior and the sewer. Complaints were also made at the same time of the offensive smells from many of the Gullies in Clapton, as low down as Lea Bridge Road. I, therefore, requested Mr. Lovegrove to have them examined, which was done when some were found to be untrapped. I also had a circular letter sent to everyone of the medical practitioners of Upper Clapton and Stamford Hill, asking for information as to the existence of cases of diphtheria, but did not receive any reply whatever except from Messrs. Toulmin, who informed me that they had cases in their practice, but did not give any names or addresses, so that I am unable to state the number of cases, except as regards those in the 134 houses visited, to which reference will be made. There have not been, so far as I know, any fresh cases or deaths since March 8th, with one exception, 24 which however is in reality not a fresh case, as it had occurred, although I was unacquainted with it, on the 8th instant." " The history of the outbreak is as follows:—On February 16th three cases which terminated fatally occurred at Powell Road, Warwick Road, and Clapton Common. Powell Road is more than a mile away, Warwick Road half-a-mile, and the Clapton Common case about a quarter-of-a-mile from the accumulation at Craven Park; the only feature common to the three being the state of the drainage arrangements which allowed sewer gas to enter all the houses. On the 21st, another case that terminated fatally occurred at Lea Bridge Road, within a short distance of Powell Road. On February 28th, another case terminating fatally happened at Clapton Common, and a sixth on March 1st, at Warwick Road, which is the last case of which I have any notice. It is, therefore, very evident that the accumulation of house refuse at Craven's Park could not have been the cause, as was believed, of the outbreak, and we must, therefore, look elsewhere for it. I, therefore, directed one of the Sanitary Inspectors to call at every house which I had not visited, between the last house at Upper Clapton and Warwick Road, when it was found including the houses in the last-named road, and one other house in Downs Park Road, where a case occurred, that out of 134 houses examined as many as 120 had good drainage arrangements, whilst in 13 they were so imperfect as to have a direct communication with the cisterns or wash basins in the house, and in another house there was a water closet opening directly into a passage in the basement which smelt very badly, and was found to be imperfectly trapped. In the 120 houses with good arrangements only 1 case occurred, whilst in the 11 as many as 12 cases happened. A close examination of the facts connected with the 14 houses, in which defective arrangements were found, revealed this additional information, viz.: that 4 drained into a different system of sewers. No case occurred in the last-mentioned houses although 25 they are nearest to the dust accumulation, whilst in the 10 having defective arrangements which were connected with the ordinary sewers of Clapton, cases of disease occurred in all but one. I may mention here that nearly all the Clapton sewage is carried into the high level sewer, whilst the four houses abovenamed drained into a sewer which opens into a system of sewers connected with the low level sewer. I think that it is impossible to have stronger evidence that the infection was conveyed into the houses of the patients by the agency of the sewer gas. Why this gas should have had a peculiar infective power at a particular time, shown by the infection simultaneously of persons living a mile apart, I am unable to determine; but this is only in accordance with what has been observed in outbreaks of diphtheria elsewhere. The occurrence, almost simultaneously of very unpleasant smells from the sewer, which is very unusual at Clapton, and of the diphtheria outbreak, point to some unusual potency for evil in the sewer gas" After this outbreak the disease declined to about its usual level in the district, as one death occurred in April, at Grange Road, Clapton, and the other in Orchard Terrace, on the 1st of May. There were also some other cases in the Grange Road and at Dalston. The water supply and drainage arrangements were not satisfactory in either of the cases examined, as in one the air pipe from the closet opened into the cistern which was covered, and there was a rush of air through it when the handle of the closet was pulled; as regards the other the rain water pipe was untrapped and connected with the drain, so that sewer gas could enter the sleeping rooms from the hopper of the pipe which is close to it. During the year a very suspicious outbreak of typhoid occurred in some houses and large institutions in this district, and in Bethnal Green, which was supplied by the same milkman. The facts are briefly these:— In October a young man residing in a milkman's house was attacked with typhoid, and kept his 26 bed for four weeks. During the time he was worst his mother, who attended upon him, on one or two occasions measured out the milk, and in November, about 14 days afterwards, cases occurred in a large institution at Hackney and in another at Bethnal Green, the places being a mile-and-a-half from one another. Three private families were also attacked about the same time, all being supplied with milk from the said dairy. Five cases occurred almost simultaneously in one establishment and four in the other, although there were, so far as I could learn, no other cases near them. I did not obtain information until too late to trace out the number of other cases, if any. Other cases of typhoid occurred during the year in houses where the drains were defective, and two where old cesspools were found under the floor of the kitchen. During the year I attended at the Worship Street and Clerkenwell Police Courts to give evidence against 90 persons who had neglected to comply with the notices served on them for the abatement of nuisances. Some of these were of more than ordinary interest, amongst which I may mention the order obtained against the London General Omnibus Company, for neglect of their contractor to promptly remove the stable dung from their premises. The plan adopted was to throw down sawdust which absorbed the urine and was swept up along with the horse droppings. This was frequently allowed to remain unremoved for some days causing a disgusting nuisance, which was much complained of. The magistrate ordered the abatement of the nuisance. Another case was heard against a sausagemaker for having in his possession meat in prepartion for the food of man, which was unfit for that purpose. The animal had suffered from lung disease which rendered the flesh dark and wet, so that on my evidence, and that of the inspector, the person was convicted in a penalty of £10. In another case the magistrates made an order for the paving and drainage of a small undedicated street which formed a cul de sac, and was held 27 to be a yard for the use of the inhabitants, as they dried their clothes by suspending them on lines stretched across the street. There were also some summonses for overcrowding, one indecent, where father, mother and six children, two nearly grown up, occupied one room. We have had, I am glad to say, very few of these cases for several years past. I have attended 32 Ordinary Meetings and 3 Special Meetings of the Sanitary Committee, as well as 12 meetings of the View Committee, for considering various matters connected with the slaughter-houses and cow-sheds of the district, as well as for viewing the premises whereon these businesses were conducted. One view and two other meetings were held specially to consider the propriety of closing all the wells on the premises occupied by cowkeepers; when after submitting an analysis of the water from 9 pumps, all of which were found to be contaminated, the committee advised the applications for licenses to be opposed at the Sessions. At the Sessions held at Edmonton the renewal of two licenses were opposed for this cause, and one other for not doing necessary work, and the applications were adjourned to enable the applicants to remove the pumps and fill up the wells, which were done. At the Prescott Street Sessions the same course was decided upon as regards seven pumps, so that I am not aware of any pumps now existing in this district on premises occupied by a cow-keeper. The Committee also took into consideration the propriety of fixing the number of cubic feet to be allowed for each cow, but after several discussions have not decided what report they should bring up to you on the subject. I also attended several special sub-committees for making inspections of several courts which were not properly paved and drained; of deposits which had been made near the Grange Road, Clapton, near the Rectory Road and other places; and an inspection of the disinfecting chamber prior to certain alterations and repairs which were required to be done. I also visited places where houses were being built on refuse or on made ground, or with 28 improper materials, and submitted some specimens to the Building Act Committee of the Metropolitan Board. I also attended before a Committee of the House of Commons to give evidence as to the necessity for an amendment of the Metropolitan Buildings Act. The contracts for the removal of dust were carried out by the same parties as in 1876, and at the same price, Mr. Iszard removing from his district 9,633 loads, and Mr. Larter 8,990 loads, between the 25th of March, 1877, to the same day in 1878. The cost for cartage at the price per load agreed upon was £2,518 14s. 4d., the wages of the men (not including the drivers) employed in removing it from the houses to the carts was £480 10s., and the inspector's salary, £78, making a total of £3,077 4s. 4d., to which must be added the hire of carts, £117, and the cost of shovels and baskets, £20 14s., making £3,214 18s. 4d., from which there has to be deducted £179 16s. 3d., payable by Mr. Button in accordance with his agreement with the Board making a nett cost of £3,035 2s. \d. As the amount payable by Mr. Button would not be paid during the current year, the nett cost will not correspond with the sum returned in the accounts, as they show the sums actually paid and received. The number of nuisances abated are appended at the end of the report, and it will be seen that 1,380 nuisances arising from various defects in drainage, or from choked drains and privy pans were attended to. That there were 3,314 nuisances caused by defects in houses or the adjoining premises, exclusive of drainage, viz.: 323 from defective paving of the yards, 462 from the want of proper dust bins, 2,271 from defective, dirty, or dilapidated houses, and 254 from defective water supply apparatus. There were also 813 houses disinfected, 26 cases of overcrowding abated, 45 pigsties removed, 161 accumulations of manure and other similar refuse removed, 2791 requests to take away dust were attended to, as well as a number of nuisances of 29 various kinds. The total number of houses inspected, viz.: 6,726, including 6,191 which were examined without complaint, and 525 concerning which complaints were received, is satisfactory, and shows the necessity for periodical examination, as 3141 houses were defective in their sanitary arrangements out of the 6,191 houses examined without previous complaint. In addition to these there were 171 greengrocers', 91 fishmongers' and poulterers' yards examined, as well as 83 cow-sheds and other places, making an aggregate of 8,387 premises examined by the Inspectors, all of whom have carried out their work to my satisfaction. The 6,191 houses examined contained 28,702 living rooms, 9,481 families, and 42,175 inmates, which is a larger number than on former inspections. There were 400 cases of small pox reported from these houses, as well as 70 of scarlet fever, 28 of typhoid fever, 8 of typhus, and 10 of simple fever. The street lists of 1871 and 1877 giving the number of small pox cases reported at the offices show that the disease was very prevalent in some streets during 1871, which were not visited in 1877, whilst in other streets numerous cases occurred in both epidemics. Thus in Templar Road which is no great distance from the Homerton Hospital, 28 cases occurred in 1871, and 20 in 1877, whilst in Brooksby's Walk which is much nearer the Hospital, 8 cases occurred in 1871 and 11 in 1877. In Bartrip Street, which is more than half-a-mile away, there were 12 cases, and in Felstead Street (a newly built street surrounded, if not built on dust deposits), there were 14 cases; in Sedgwick Street, adjoining Felstead Street, there were 9 cases. In Goring Street, Duncan Street, Elizabeth Cottages, Church Terrace, Percy Road, Palace Road, and other streets in which there were very numerous cases in 1871, there were none or next to none in 1877. Indeed, with a few exceptions, the disease did not spread to anything like so many persons in a street as in 1871, owing to a more speedy removal of the affected persons. If we have suffered in this district, which is doubtful, from the presence of 30 the hospital, we have certainly derived a benefit from the short distance for which it was necessary to remove the patients. As regards the Priory Estate it will be seen by referring to the supplemental list how severely the disease raged in Clifden Road, and how many of the streets on this estate were infected to a greater or less extent. The meteorology for the year 1877 was somewhat unusual, as in the months of January and February the temperature was respectively 4.1 and 4.3 degrees above the average of the preceding 36 years, whilst in March it was 1.0 degree below the mean. The rainfall in January was large amounting to nearly 4½ inches, which is 2½ inches above the average. The rainfall in February and March was also in excess; the total for these months being 3.3 inches above the mean. The cold of March was continued into April and May when the mean temperature was below the average by 1.8 degrees and 3.9 respectively, and the excessive rainfall was also continued in April when 3.2 inches fell, or 1½ inches more than usual. The coldest days in these months occurred between May 1st and the 6th, when the deficiency averaged 11½ degrees. On May 4 the thermometer recorded 4 degrees below freezing point, and frosts occurred also on the 3rd, 6th and 7th. In July and September the mean temperature was again in defect to the extent 1.4 degrees in the former, and as much as 4.4 degrees in the latter, being however in excess in August to a small amount, viz. 0.2 degrees. The cold in September was so unusual that there is no record of so low a mean temperature for that month, viz. 52.9, since the year 1803. October was also a cold month, but November was almost as unusually warm as September was cold, the mean temperature being 45°5 or 1.9 degrees above the average of 36 years, which included a large number of warm Novembers. December was also warm, viz. 40°8 for the mean. The rainfall in October and December was in defect, but in November it amounted to 3.4 inches or 1.1 inches above the average. In nearly all the months of this year 31 the air was drier than usual. The rainfall in July and September was small, viz. 3.5 inches, but in August it was 2.9 inches, so that the deficiency for the summer was one inch for the three months. One result of this deficiency in the mean temperature of July and September was that the ordinary autumnal diarrhoea did not occur to the usual extent.
