The District, as a whole, affords one house to 1.6 families and 8.7 persons; whilst the a2 Offices of the BomMof Works for the Whitechapel District, Sanitary Department, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E. February yd, 1892. Gentlemen, I propose to commence my Eighth Annual Report by considering a few of the details connected with the Census Returns, so far as they concern the Whitechapel District. Although the particulars are sent from the Office of the Registrar-General as " unrevised," it is highly improbable that the results will be much affedted by subsequent revision. The total population has been computed at 74,261, divided unequally, beyond any surmise on my part, amongst the five sub-Registration Districts. First of all, I notice the increase in the birth-rate since the last census returns were issued—an increase which of course disarranged calculations which were based upon the former numbers during the inter-censal period. 4 Spitalfields Sub-District has 1.7 families to each house, and 9.3 persons. Mile End New Town has 1.8 families, and 10.1 persons to each house: Whitechapel Church Sub-District has 1.4 families, and 5.3 persons to each house. Goodman's Fields has 2.2 families, and 4.7 persons to each house : and Aldgate has 1.2 families and 4.7 persons to each house. We must look to the number of children belonging to the different families to account for these variations. The Census populations for 1871, 1881, and 1891, as recorded, were respectively 76,573, 71,363, and 74,261. Another evidence as regards the mixed population now contained within the Whitechapel District, is afforded by the fact that whereas the general birth-rate is 41.2 per 1000, that for each Sub-District is as under For the Spitalfields Sub-District 41.8 per 1000 ,, Mile End New Town 48.5 ,, ,, Whitechapel Church 39.5 ,, ,, Goodman's Fields 35.5 ,, Aldgate 31.0 Such differences as are here indicated explainbetterthe causes which operate in the result, than could any verbal description, however graphic. That this increase in the birth-rate was not unexpected is shown by a paragraph which I cull from my Report for the year 1890:— " It is probable that the birth-rate of the Whitechapel population " has increased. Such increase in the birth-rate is rendered more " probable by reason of the great addition it has received during " the last few years to the number of its model dwellings, where " the choice of selection, which is freely exercised, aggregates " persons of an age, eminently calculated to increase the number " of births."

The first Table of the Appendix as usual explains where these births were registered.* I have further dealt with the 127 births which took place in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, and distributed them amongst the several Sub-Districts where the mothers previously resided, so that correctly the births are as here stated0 Spitalfields. Mile End New Town. Whitechapel Church. Goodman's Fields. Aldgate. Total. 939 869 803 237 215 3063 The total deaths which were registered during the year amounted to 2,425. They were registered by the local registrars as set out in Table B.* Many of the persons included in the returns were non-residents, and of course some residents died in institutions, etc., outside the District. Tables C* and D* exhibit in detail these deaths. It will suffice now to explain that the correct number of District deaths is arrived at by deducting from the total, 778, that being the number of non-resident deaths, and then adding the 192 deaths of residents from outlying institutions. Thus the correift District mortality amounts to 1839. which is equal to a death-rate of 24.7 per 1000 calculated upon the enumerated population. The death-rate in the last Census year was 26.6 per 1000 ; there is here matter for congratulation—a reduction in the District death-rate of 2 per 1000. The natural increase of births over deaths was 1224. * Page 33, 6 Percentage of Deaths for each Age period:— 26.7 °/0 of the total deaths took place under the age of 1 year. 13.7 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5. 4.2 „ ,, „ „ 5 and 20. 13.3 „ „ „ „ 20 and 40. 21.5 „ ,, ,, ,, 40 and 60. iS'O ,, „ „ 60 and 80. 2.3 ,, ,, ,, over the age of 80. I have distributed in Table F* of the Appendix, the District deaths according to age selection. The deaths of infants under the age of one year, in London, equalled 23.0 per cent, of the total deaths, and 15.3 per cent, of the registered births: whilst in the Whitechapel District, those infants who died under the age of one year, equalled 26.7 per cent, of the total deaths, and 16.0 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 36.8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.6 per cent. of the registered births ; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 40.4 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.2 per cent. of the registered births. This branch of statistics compares most favorably with the record of former years. Table It of the Appendix contains under each class of disease, the percentage of deaths for that class to total deaths in the District. The Metropolitan deaths, and the Whitechapel District deaths, according to this arrangement, are contrasted in the manner I have adopted for several years. From the Zymotic class of diseases, the District deaths are seen to be fewer proportionately than are the Metropolitan deaths. On the other hand the Metropolitan statistics are more favorable than our own, when we contrast the deaths from Constitutional diseases, and diseases of the respiratory system. Small.pox has been absent from our Mortality Returns for another year : eight deaths were registered from this cause amongst Metropolitan Residents. The Royal Commission on Vaccination are still engaged in collecting evidence. Meantime it is gratifying to know that the Vaccination Officer, Mr. W. M. S. Sherman, as * Page 34. †Page 36 7 usual, produces an excellent record of useful work which in the form of a Table, * I have introduced into the Appendix. As the deaths from zymotic causes, as well as all others, are arranged in Table Mf I do not propose to individually deal with this Table now, but certain points arrest attention whilst looking over the figures. Notice first, that Measles and Whooping Cough together are responsible for the same number of deaths as all the zymotic diseases which are included in the Notification SeCtions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Next, that Diarrhcea (chiefly of infants) produced 45 deaths, whilst Influenza killed 50 persons. About this disease I have not much to say. It is now accepted as a maxim, that Influenza is both infectious and contagious. Whilst it respeCts generally no class of society, it appears to have expended its virulence more particularly upon the very poor in the Whitechapel District. In nearly all the deaths, a secondary cause was added, such being almost, universally, a bronchial or lung complication. I have extracted a few details from my notes of the year's work which I append without venturing to offer any explanation concerning them. The total deaths during the year from Influenza amounted to 50. Males were victims in 28 instances. Twenty-nine of the deaths occurred in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, and in all other parts of the District and in outlying Public Institutions there died twenty-one persons. Previous residence of Persons dying from Influenza : — Spitalfields Sub-District 22 Mile End New Town Sub-District 5 Whitechapel Church ,, 9 Goodman's Fields ,, 3 Aldgate ,, 7 Unknown 4 5o The registered common lodging-houses in Spitalfields contributed greatly to the above list. * Page 36. † Page 37. 8 Age at Death of the 50 Influenza Cases:— 1 died under the age of 1 year 3 ,, between the ages of 1 and 5 Nil „ „ „ 5 and 20 11 „ „ „ 20 and 40 17 „ „ „ 40 and 60 18 „ „ „ 60 and 80 The deaths were Registered as follows:— Week ending May gth 11 cases „ „ „ 16th 5„ „ „ „ 23rd 7 „ „ „ „ 30th 7„ ,, „ June 6th 3 „ „ „ „ 13th 3„ „ „ „ 20th 3 „ „ 27th 2 „ „ ,, July 18th 1 case „ „ „ 25th 1 ,, „ „ Aug. 1st 1 ,, ,, Sept. 26th 1 ,, ,, ,, Dec. 19th 5 cases Cases of Influenza attended by the District Medical Officers Week ending Feby. 21st 1 case ,, ,, April nth 1 ,, ,, ,, ,, 25th 2 cases ,, „ May 2nd 22 ,, „ „ „ 9th 29„ „ „ „ 16th 3„ „ „ „ 23rd 34 ,, „ „ „ 30th 41„ „ „ June 6th 20 „ „ „ „ 13th 15„ „ „ „ 20th 9 „ „ „ „ 27th 6 „ „ „ „ July 4th 4 „ „ „ „ 11th 2 ,, „ „ „ 18 th 4 „ „ „ 25th 1 case „ „ „ Aug. 1st 2 cases 9 Week ending Aug. 8th 2 cases ,, ,, ,, 29th 1 case ,, ,, Sept. 6th 3 cases „ „ „ 13th 2 ,, „ „ Oct. 17th 2 ,, ,, ,, ,, 24th 7 „ ,, ,, ,, 31st 1 case ,, ,, Nov. 7th 3 cases ,, ,, ,, 14th 2 ,, ,, ,, ,, 21st 4 „ ,, ,, ,, 28th 5 „ ,, ,, Dec. 5th 7 ,, „ „ „ 12th 7 „ ,, ,, ,, 19th 4 „ ,, ,, ,,26th 5 „ It is further manifest that the disease varied in intensity at different periods of the epidemic. In the first week during which deaths were registered, by far the greatest number of deaths took place than occurred in any subsequent week, whereas it was several weeks later before the epidemic was at its height as regards the number of cases as recorded by the District Medical Officers. It appears to me that the lesson to be derived from the behaviour of Influenza under its different manifestations is this : Negledt no febrile disease suddenly attacking a patient, however slight it may appear to be. Avoid exposure to change of temperature during the progress of, and for some time after, an attack. Adopt such system of isolation as can be arranged for the earliest cases which occur. I invite attention to Table O* which details the cases dealt with by your Inspectors during the year under the Notification Act. Nearly half of the total cases were admitted into the Asylums Board Hospitals. Although this particular department of work shows a decline, when contrasted with last year's return, it is not fair to assume that the Notification Act is responsible for such diminished number of cases, because there are seasons when certain diseases are prone to become epidemic, and other years when such diseases are comparatively absent. Scarlet Fever in 1890 appeared in * Page 40. B 10 237 cases, and in 1891 only 102 cases were reported. This Table and the following Table,* together with the Special Report on the year's work which I have included in the Appendix, represents an amount of patient, persevering, and intelligent interest on the part of your Inspectors, which demands warm recognition at my hands. The house-to-house inspection has been performed at such times as could be arranged, and a record is preserved of all such examinations. / Although the carrying out of the Food and Drugs Act does not come within my province, I have thought its work would be a fitting adjunct to my Report upon the District Health Work, and your Inspector has been asked to compile a brief record of his proceedings during the year. It is added to the Appendix. The extra Metropolitan Asylums' deaths are now included in the Returns of Deaths occurring in Outlying Public Institutions, because I now receive the details of both, v/eekly, from the Registrar-General's Office.

During the year the Coroners inquired into the cause of death Inquests in 354 cases. Only 183 of investigations had reference to Whitechapel District-residents. I am happy to be able to report the completion of the Public Mortuary. It remains only for details of administration to be arranged, and for regulations to be agreed to, before the building can be opened to supply the necessity which your Board has been until now unable to afford by reason of the difficulty in obtaining a suitable site. In my last year's Report, your Surveyor gave a description of the accommodation to be allowed, and I am now of opinion that much benefit will result to the District from the new Mortuary when it becomes generally known that so useful and excellent a building is available. I have nothing to add to the Reports which I have given annually in the past upon water supply. The Water Supply monthly returns from the Government, as well to the District, as those supplied from the offices of the Companies, indicate a proper distribution of water, both as regards quality and quantity. 13 REGISTERED COMMON LODGING HOUSES, 1891.

Whilst on this subject, it may not altogether be out of place if I allude to certain institutions which have latelj- appeared in the District; they are founded for philanthropic purposes, and they escape police supervision because they avoid registration under the Common Lodging-houses Acts. These so-called 'shelters' are open apparently to all comers, and the friends of the 'Associations' endeavour with great vigour to supply them with lodgers collected from all parts of the Metropolis and elsewhere. It might have been hoped that the principals of the ' shelters ' would draft their visitors into useful employment in London, the Country, or even in the Colonies—but a few particulars which I have been at the trouble to collect do not support the theory that such is the intention of the promoters of these refuges. At any rate, the result has not been in that direction. I find that the District Medical Officers have, during the year 15 1891, given admission orders into the Whitechapel Infirmary to lodgers from the following institutions:— Shelter. No. of Admission Orders given. Salvation Army Shelter for men, 272, Whitechapel-road 241 ,, „ women, 194, Hanbury-street 254 ,, ,, men, Quaker-street 80 „ ,, men, 53, Royal Mint-street (to be opened in January, 1892 Church Army Shelter for men, 83, Whitechapel-road 5 Tenter-street Shelter for Foreign Jews 24 Barnardo's Shelter for women, 12, Dock-street 18 622 I have no record of the admissions into the Infirmary without the orders from the Doctors, but the number given constitutes iy\ per cent. of the total admissions upon the usual orders. I do not propose at present to reflect further upon this subject, but I feel that a sentence in my Report for 1890, applies here with some force:—"If these figures have any value, they show the urgent " need for legislation which shall provide for the welfare of the " submerged tenth." A comparison with the Table of last year will show that still more Model Dwellings have been added to those therein contained. New apartments have been provided to the number Model of 337 ; accommodation has thus been found for Dwellings. 1868 more persons. The total deaths, however, are only 4 in excess of those of the previous year. The death-rate is 23.8 per 1000. It is of course apparent that some model dwellings are models of hygienic construction, and others ought rather to be chosen for models of what to avoid, in planning residences for the labouring classes. I have selected 6 of the buildings belonging to each class, and whilst the former has a death-rate of 15-5 per 1000, the latter has a record of 27'! per 1000. I append the entire list, and the necessary statistics, so that anyone who is acquainted with the District can prove these calculations to his own satisfaction. 16 MODEL DWELLINGS.

I regret to say that a careful study of all the circumstances, so far as I am able to appreciate them, in connection with the Model Dwellings in the Whitechapel District, has not enlisted me amongst the enthusiasts of this method of providing for the housing of the Working Classes. Under this Act, your Officers have been enabled to obtain some very important structural improvement during Housing of the the year. I cannot convey to your Board conWorking cisely a summary of the work thus performed, Classes Act, better, than by quoting from a letter which I 1890. sent to the Clerk to the London County Council at the end of the year. The letter was a reply to a request for information in the form of a report concerning certain representations which the Council is empowered to ask for:— " So that the Council may now have full information upon the " works carried out by the Whitechapel District Board under the " Act mentioned, I have appended a complete record up to date. " By such returns it will be seen that in two cases only have '' Courts of Law been invoked to aid the Board in carrying on "this part of its work. It is further to be noticed that the returns " indicate that through the action of the Board of Works for the " Whitechapel District, 46 houses have been closed and pulled "down; 16 are undergoing process of demolition; 53 have been " closed by consent of the owners, and 8 by Magistrates' orders; " 19 have been repaired and cleansed, and are re-occupied : and 28 " are now, under contract, being extensively repaired. Thus in " less than 10 months, 170 houses have been dealt with by the " Board." From a careful study of the New Public Health (London) Act, 1891, I am not sure, but in some cases, the modes of procedure introduced as well as the ultimate results to be derived from its operations, will prove it to be better than the Act of 1890. 18 With the year 1891 terminate some Acts of Parliament with which Local Boards and their Officers have Publ ic Health been for many years familiar. Such Acts as (London) "The Nuisances Removal Act, 1855" and its Act, 1891. Amendment Acts ; the various Sanitary Acts; the Diseases Prevention Act (Metropolis). &c.; have done good service in the past, and as they are all incorporated and amended in the new Act which becomes operative on the 1st day of January, 1892, a distinct gain will be generally felt by those who have to rely upon legal measures to obtain sanitary improvements. It will of course be obvious that some difficulties may present themselves at first on account of the altered law, and I have thought therefore that it would be of service to briefly draw attention to the chief changes that have taken place. In Sec. 2, there has been added "or dangerous to health" to the former words " a nuisance, or injurious," and some additions have been made to the list of nuisances. It is also provided that overcrowding renders a house unfit " whether the inmates are, or are not, members of the same family." The absence of certain water fittings are deemed to cause a nuisance, and this sedtion concludes by giving discretionary powers to a magistrate as regards overcrowding under certain circumstances. Sec. 3 renders it competent "for any person" to give notice to the Sanitary Authority of the existence of a nuisance. Every officer of a Sanitary Authority, as well as "every Relieving Officer," must also give information in accordance with regulations which each body is called upon to make; such Authority will also give directions that the existence of a nuisance shall be immediately brought to the notice of any person who may be required to abate it, and the officer shall do so by serving a written information. Sec 4 provides that in serving notice upon a person requiring the abatement of a nuisance, the Sanitary Authority may or not, at its discretion, specify the works to be executed. The offender may also be required to prevent the recurrence of the nuisance complained of, even though it may for the time have been abated. Where overcrowding exists, increased power is given by the addition of the words " or part of a house.". 19 Hitherto no adequate penalty was forthcoming even in cases of gross negletft by house owners. "A fine not exceeding ten pounds," now introduced, may cause a little more energy to be called forth when nuisances require abatement. Sec. 5 enacts that where such notice from the Sanitary Authority is disregarded, a magistrate may make an order, which at his discretion, may specify what works shall be executed. A closing order may also be made, and a fine of" not exceeding twenty pounds," may be inflicted. Sec. 6 provides for certain arrangements, should an appeal from the Magistrate's Order be made to a Court of Quarter Sessions against a prohibition or closing Order, or against an Order for the execution of structural works. In such an event, the Court has power to order that the works shall be executed by the Sanitary Authority, who may recover the costs in a summary manner. Sec. 7 enacts that a Petty Sessional Court, in the case of two convictions for overcrowding within a period of three months, may order the house to be closed for such period as the Court may deem necessary. This Order may be issued whether the persons convicted were or were not the same. Sec. g, in giving authority for the sale of things removed in carrying out works to abate a nuisance by the Sanitary Authority, includes the words " or doing what is necessary to prevent the recurrence of" the nuisance. Sec.11 does not provide that when expenses are sought to be recovered by the Sanitary Authority for abating a nuisance, it shall be necessary to prove that the house was unfit for human habitation. It is further said, " and in case of nuisances caused by the act or default of the owner of premises, such costs and expenses may be recovered from any person who is for the time being owner of such premises." It is also competent for the costs, expenses and fines to be recovered in the High Court, or in a summary manner, or in the County Court. Sec. 15 reads: "If a person causes any drain, water-closet, "earth-closet, privy, or ash-pit, to be a nuisance, or injurious, or " dangerous to health, by wilfully destroying or damaging the " same, or any water-supply, apparatus, pipe, or work connected " therewith, or by otherwise wilfully stopping up, or wilfully c2 20 "interfering with, or improperly using the same, or any such " water-supply, apparatus, pipe, or work, he shall be liable to " a fine not exceeding five pounds." Sec. 16 calls upon every Sanitary Authority to make bye-laws for certain purposes, including the prevention of nuisances arising from snow, ice, salt, dust, ashes, &c., &c., or other matter or thing in any street. This section is founded upon Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, as well as the Metropolitan Police Act, and the Metropolis Management A(ft. I find that the only Whitechapel street named in the Police Act, wherein refuse must not be collected between 10 a m. and 7 p.m., is Whitechapel High Street, up to Church Lane. A penalty not exceeding forty shillings is incurred by infringing this clause. Sec. 18 states: "Where it is proved to the satisfaction of a "Petty Sessional Court that any locality, premises, or place, are " or is, unfit for the keeping of any animal, the Court may by " summary order prohibit the using thereof for that purpose for the " future." Sec. 19 deals with offensive trades, with the addition of the words " or horses "after" slaughterer of cattle." Sub-Section 2 has a saving clause as regards the business of soap-boiler: " Provided that this enactment shall not render any person liable " to a fine for establishing anew with the sandlion of the County "Council, or carrying on, the business of soap-boiler, if and as " long as that business is a business in which tallow or any animal "fat or oil, other than olein, is not used by admixture with alkali " for the production of soap." The County Council are to give their sanction, after giving notice in the usual way, " and by " causing a copy of the notice to be affixed in a conspicuous " part of the said premises," so that objections may be heard and considered. Sec. 20, which deals with the licensing of cowhouses and slaughterhouses, is enlarged so as to include a "slaughterer of horses, or knacker," as well as a slaughterer of cattle or dairyman as of old. The following sub-sedlion (5) is altogether new: " Where a " Committee of the County Council determine to refuse, or to " recommend the Council to refuse, the renewal of any license 21 " under this section, the County Council shall, on written applica" tion made within seven days after such determination is made " known to the applicant, hear the applicant against such refusal." Sec. 21, provides for a fine where this part of the Act is contravened of a sum not exceeding fifty pounds, instead of as formerly five pounds for a first offence. Sec. 22, which consists of two sub-sections concerns Local Authorities only. It enacts as follows:— " The removal of house refuse and street refuse by a sanitary " authority when collected or deposited by that authority shall be " deemed to be a business carried on by that authority within the " meaning of the last preceding section,* and a complaint or " proceedings under that section in relation to any such business " may be made or taken by the County Council in like manner as" if the Council were a sanitary authority. " Any premises used by a Sanitary Authority for the treatment " or disposal of any street refuse or house refuse, as distinct from "the removal thereof, which are a nuisance or injurious, or " dangerous to health, shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with " summarily under this Act, and for the purpose of the application " thereto of the provision of this Act relating to such nuisances, " the County Council shall be deemed to be a Sanitary Authority." Sees. 23 and 24, contain a few unimportant amendments relating to " Smoke Consumption." Sees. 25 and 26, enact new Law as follows:— " Where, on the certificate of a Medical Officer of Health or " Sanitary Inspector, it appears to any Sanitary Authority that " the limewashing, cleansing, or purifying of any Workshops " workshop (other than a bakehouse,) or of any and " part thereof, is necessary for the health of the Bakehouses. " persons employed therein, the Sanitary Authority " shall serve notice in writing on the owner or " occupier of the workshop to limewash, cleanse, or purify the " workshop or part as the case requires, within the time specified "in the notice; and, if the person on whom notice is so served " fails to comply therewith, he shall be liable to a fine not * Sec. 21 provides for the aition to be taken before a Justice to abate any nuisance arising from offensive trade. 22 " exceeding five pounds and to a further fine not exceeding " ten shillings for every day during which he continues to make " default after conviction; and the Sanitary Authority may, if " they think fit, cause the workshop or part to be limewashed, " cleansed, or purified, and may recover in a summary manner " the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the person on " whom the notice was served. " This section shall apply to any factory which is not subject to " the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and the " Acts amending the same, and to any workplace, in like manner " as it applies to a workshop. "Sections thirty-four, thirty-five, and eighty-one of the Factory " and Workshop Act, 1878, and sections fifteen and sixteen of the " Factory and Workshop Act Amendment Act, 1883 (which relate " to cleanliness, ventilation, and other sanitary conditions), shall, " as respects every bakehouse which is a workshop, be enforced " by the Sanitary Authority of the district in which the bakehouse " is situate, and they shall be the Local Authority within the " meaning of those sections. " For the purposes of this section, the provisions of this Act " with respect to the admission of the Sanitary Authority and " their Officers into any premises for any purpose in relation to " nuisances shall apply in like manner as if they were herein " re-enacted, and in terms made applicable to this section ; and " every person refusing or failing to allow the Sanitary Authority " or their Officer to enter any premises in pursuance of those " provisions for the purposes of this section shall be subject to a " fine." Sec. 29 by sub-section 3, enacts that " so much of any Act as " requires the occupier or owner of any premises Removal " in London to cause the footways and waterof Refuse. "courses adjoining the premises to be swept "and cleansed is hereby repealed." Sec. 30 recites: " It shall be the duty of every Sanitary " Authority to secure the due removal at proper periods of house " refuse from premises, and the due cleansing out and emptying " at proper periods of ashpits, and of earth closets, privies, and " cesspools (if any), in their district, and the giving of sufficient 23 " notice of the times appointed for such removal, cleansing out, " and emptying, and where the house refuse is not removed from '• any premises in the district at the ordinary period, or any " ashpit, earth-closet, privy, or cesspool, in or under any building " in the district, is not cleansed out or emptied at the ordinary " period, and the occupier of the premises serves on the Authority " a written notice requiring the removal of such refuse, or the " cleansing out and emptying of the ashpit, earth-closet, privy, or " cesspool, as the case may be, to comply with such notice within " forty-eight hours after that service, exclusive of Sundays and " public holidays. . " If a Sanitary Authority fail without reasonable cause to comply " with this section, they shall be liable to a fine not exceeding " twenty pounds. " If any person in the employ of the Sanitary Authority, or of " any contractor with the Sanitary Authority, demands from an " occupier or his servant any fee or gratuity for removing any " house refuse from any premises, he shall be liable to a fine not " exceeding twenty shillings." Sec. 35 : " Where it appears to a Sanitary Inspector that any " accumulation of any obnoxious matter, whether manure, dung, " soil, filth, or other matter, ought to be removed, and it is not the " duty of the Sanitary Authority to remove the same, he shall " serve notice on the owner thereof, or on the occupier of the " premises on which it exists, requiring him to remove the same, " and if the notice is not complied with within forty-eight hours " from the service thereof, exclusive of Sundays and public holi" days, the matter referred to shall be the property of the Sanitary " Authority, and be removed and disposed of by them, and the " proceeds (if any) of such disposal shall be applied in payment of " the expenses incurred with reference to the matter removed, and " the surplus (if any) shall be paid on demand to the former owner " of the matter. " The expenses of such renewal and disposal, so far as not " covered by sych proceeds, may be recovered by the Sanitary " Authority in a summary manner from the former owner of the " matter removed, or from the occupier, or, where there is no " occupier, the owner of the premises." 24 Sec. 37, sub-section 4 (b.):—"Where a watercloset has before " the commencement of this Act, been and Regulations " is used in common by the inmates of two as to Water "or more houses, and in the opinion of the closets, &C. " Sanitary Authority may continue to be pro" perly so used, they need not require a water" closet to be provided for each house." Sec. 39 :—" The County Council shall make bye-laws with " respect to waterclosets, earth-closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, " and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof in " connexion with buildings, whether constructed before or after " the passing of this Act. " Every Sanitary Authority shall make bye-laws with respect " to the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for " their effective action. " It shall be the duty of every Sanitary Authority to observe " and enforce the bye-laws under this section ; and any directions "given by the Sanitary Authority under this Act shall be in " accordance with the said bye-laws, and so far as they are not so " in accordance shall be void." Sec. 40 which makes provision for the due care of water-closets, &c., now includes ' ash-pit.' Sec. 41 which forbids without the consent of the Sanitary Authority the re-construction of any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, or cesspool, which has been ordered by them either not to be made, or to be demolished, now excludes " sewer and drain " which were mentioned in former Acts. Sec. 42 recites : " If a water-closet or drain is so constructed or " repaired as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, " the person who undertook or executed such construction or " repair, shall, unless he shows that such construction or repair " was not due to any wilful act, neglect, or default, be liable to a " fine not exceeding twenty pounds. " Provided that where a person is charged with an offence under " this section, he shall be entitled upon information duly laid by " him, to have any other person, being his agent, servant, or " workman, whom he charges as the actual offender, brought before " the court at the time appointed for hearing the charge, and if he 25 " proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had used due " diligence to prevent the commission of the offence, and that the " said other person committed the offence without his knowledge, " consent, or connivance, he shall be exempt from any fine, and the " said other person may be summarily convicted of the offence." Sec. 44 is somewhat amended from former provisions, so that every Sanitary Authority may now provide and maintain " public "lavatories and ashpits," and " for the purpose of such provision " the subsoil of any road, exclusive of any footway adjoining any " building or the curtilage of a building, shall be vested in the " Sanitary Authority." Sec. 47, sub-section 3, provides : " Where it is shown that any " article liable to be seized under this section, Unsound "and found in the possession of any person was Food. " purchased by him from another person for the " food of man, and when so purchased was in " such a condition as to be liable to be seized and condemned " under this section, the person who so sold the same shall be " liable to the fine and imprisonment above-mentioned,t unless he " proves that at the time he sold the said article, he did not know, " and had no reason to believe that it was in such condition." " Where a person convicted of an offence under this section has " been within twelve months previously convicted of an offence " under this section, the Court may, if it thinks fit, and finds that " he knowingly and wilfully committed both such offences, order " that a notice of the facts be affixed, in such form and manner, " and for such period not exceeding twenty-one days, as the " Court may order, to any premises occupied by that person, and " that the person do pay the costs of such affixing; and if any " person obstructs the affixing of such notice, or removes, defaces " or conceals the notice while affixed during the said period, he "shall for each offence be liable to a fine not exceeding five " pounds. If the occupier of a licensed slaughter-house is convicted " of an offence under this section, the Court convicting him may "cancel the license for such slaughter-house.'' * Not exceeding fifty pounds for every animal, or article, or if the article consists of fruit, vegetables, corn, bread, or flour, for every parcel thereof so condemned, or, at the discretion of the Court, without the inflidtion of a fine, to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months with or without hard labour. 26 " Where a person has in his possession any article which is " unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, he may, " by written notice to the Sanitary Authority, specifying such " article, and containing a sufficient identification of it, request its " removal, and the Sanitary Authority shall cause it to be " removed as if it were trade refuse." Sec. 48 : "A house which after the commencement of this Act " is newly erefted, or is pulled down to or below Provisions as "the ground floor and rebuilt, shall not be to Water. " occupied as a dwelling house until the Sanitary " Authority have certified that it has a proper " and sufficient supply of water, either from a Water Company " or by some other means. If the Sanitary Authority refuse such "certificate, or fail to give it within one month after written " request for the same from the owner of the house, the owner " of the house may apply to a Petty Sessional Court, and that " Court, after hearing or giving the Sanitary Authority an " opportunity to be heard, may, if they think the certificate ought " to have been granted, make an order authorising the occupation " of the house; but, unless such order is made, an owner who " occupies, or permits to be occupied, the house as a dwelling" house without such certificate, shall be liable to a fine not " exceeding ten pounds, and to a fine not exceeding twenty "shillings for every day during which it is so occupied, until a " proper and sufficient supply of water is provided; but the "imposition of such a fine shall be without prejudice to any " proceedings for obtaining a closing order." Sec. 49 now requires Water Companies to do legally that which they always did, viz.: where they cut off the water supply from any house to notify the same within twenty-four hours to the Sanitary Authority. A breach of this clause is punishable by a fine of ten pounds. Sec. 50 enacts that: " Every Sanitary Authority shall make " bye-laws for securing the cleanliness and freedom from pollution " of tanks, cisterns, and other receptacles used for storing of water " used or likely to be used by man for drinking or domestic " purposes, or for manufacturing drink for the use of man." Sec. 54 is amended by the addition of the words " or for manu" facturing drink for the use of man " and " or is likely to be so 27 " polluted " and " or dangerous," all in 5th and the 6th lines of the section. ' Sec. 55 amends the former act by requiring the medical practitioner who notifies to the Sanitary Authority, to Infectious amplify the particulars, in accordance with the Diseases.— amended form. It also modifies the duties of Notification. Superintendents to the Asylums Board Hospitals so far as concerns notification to Sanitary Authorities. It further requires that the Medical Officer of Health shall, within twelve hours from the receipt of notification of an infectious disease, send a copy " to the head teacher of the school " attended by the patient (if a child), or by any child who is an " inmate of the same house as the patient." It is also enacted that the Metropolitan Asylum Managers shall send weekly " to " every Medical Officer of Health such return of the infectious " diseases of which they receive certificates in pursuance of this " section as the County Council require." Sec. 60 gives power to any legally qualified Medical Practitioner as well as to the Medical Officer of Health, to Infectious certify that the "destruction of such articles" Diseases: would tend to prevent or check any.dangerous Prevention, infectious disease. The Sanitary Authority shall then serve notice on the master, " or where the house or part is unoccupied on the owner." Then the Sanitary Authority must be responsible for the proper and efficient performance of this duty. Sees. 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67. and 68, are re-enactments of former law with some few <! enlargements " of meaning. Thus the " Master of any house or part of a house " is the person primarily responsible under this part of the ACt. Sees. 69 and 70 enact that " A person who knows himself to be " suffering from a dangerous infectious disease shall not milk any " animal or pick fruit, and shall not engage in any occupation " connected with food, or carry on any trade or business in such a " manner as to be likely to spread the infectious disease, and if he " does so he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. It " shall not be lawful for any owner or driver of a public con" veyance knowingly to convey, or for any other person knowingly " to place, in any public conveyance, a person suffering from any 28 " dangerous infectious disease, or for a person suffering from any " such disease to enter any public conveyance, and if he does so, " he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds; and, if any " person so suffering is conveyed in any public conveyance, the " owner or driver thereof, as soon as it comes to his knowledge, " shall give notice to the Sanitary Authority, and shall cause such " conveyance to be disinfected, and if he fails so to do, he shall be, " liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds, and the owner or " driver of such conveyance shall be entitled to recover in a " summary manner from the person so conveyed by him or from " the person causing that person to be so conveyed a sum sufficient " to cover any loss and expense incurred by him in connexion " with such disinfection. It shall be the duty of the Sanitary " Authority, when so requested by the owner or driver of such " public conveyance, to provide for the disinfection of the same, " and they may do so free of charge." The amendments contained in the next four sections are chiefly technical. Sec. 76 has little interest for our districft, but as the words are new, I will quote them : " Any expenses incurred Hospitals " by a Sanitary Authority in maintaining in a and " hospital (whether or not belonging to that Ambulances. " Authority) a patient who is not a pauper, and " is not suffering from an infectious disease, shall "be a simple contract debt due to the Sanitary Authority from " that patient, or from any person liable by law to maintain him, " but proceedings for its recovery shall not be commenced after " the expiration of six months from the discharge of the patient, " or if he dies in such hospital, from the date of his death." Sec. 80, sub-sees. 2 and 3 now provide that the patient and his friends are no longer liable for costs of maintenance incurred by the Metropolitan Asylum Managers. All such expenses '' shall be " paid by the Board of Guardians of the Poor Law Union from " which he is received." Sec. 81 declares that children sent by the London School Board to any industrial school outside London, shall be considered as belonging to London in the event of being admitted into any hospital belonging to the Metropolitan Asylum Managers. 29 Sec. 88, by the substitution of the word "shall" for "may" renders it compulsory for every Sanitary Authority Mortuaries, to provide a Mortuary, and they may make byelaws with respect to the management of the building. Sec. go gives power to the County Council to compel Sanitary Authorities to provide and maintain a proper building for the reception of dead bodies during the time required to conduct any post-mortem examination ordered by a coroner or other constituted authority. Sec. 91 : "Any Sanitary Authorities may, with the approval of " the County Council, execute their duty under this Act, with " respect to mortuaries and buildings for post-mortem examina" tions by combining for the purpose thereof, or by contracting for " the use by one of the contracting authorities of any such " mortuary or building provided by another of such contracting " authorities, and may so combine or contract upon such terms as " may be agreed upon.'' Sec. 92 : "The County Council shall provide and maintain " proper accommodation for the holding of inquests, and may by " agreement with a Sanitary Authority provide and maintain the " same in connexion with a mortuary or a building for post" mortem examinations provided by that Authority, or with any " building belonging to that Authority, and may do so on such "terms as may be agreed on with the Authority." Sec. 94 declares that " Every Sanitary Authority shall make " and enforce such bye-laws as are requisite Bye-laws as " for the following matters." This and the to Houses following several sections contain much that let in we are already familiar with, but in certain Lodgings. instances necessary amendments have been introduced. In the case of underground rooms, it is required that " every wall of the room " shall be "constructed " with a proper damp course, and, if in contact with the soil " it shall be " effectually secured against dampness from that soil." The area already provided for must be " properly paved." " Any drain passing under the room is to be properly constructed " of a gas-tight pipe." " The room must be effectually ventilated." 30 " For the purpose of this section, the expression ' underground " room ' includes any room of a house the surface of the floor " of which room is more than three feet below the surface of the " footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or " nearest to the room." Sec. 98 : " Where two convictions for an offence relating to the " occupation of an underground room as a dwelling, have taken " place within a period of three months (whether the persons "convicted were or were not the same), a petty sessional court " may direct the closing of the underground room for such period " as the court may deem necessary, or may empower the Sanitary " Authority of the district permanently to close the same, in such " manner as they think fit, at their own cost." Sec. 99. " Where a Sanitary Authority appoint a Committee " for the purposes of this Act, that Committee, subject to terms " of their appointment, may serve and receive notices, take pro" ceedings, and empower any officer of the Authority to make " complaints and take proceedings in their behalf, and otherwise " to execute this Act." Sec. 100. " The County Council, on it being proved to their " satisfaction that any Sanitary Authority have made default in " doing their duty under this Act with respect to the removal of " any nuisance, the institution of any proceedings, or the enforce" ment of any byelaw, may institute any proceedings and do any " atft which the Authority might have instituted or done for that " purpose, and shall be entitled to recover from the Sanitary " Authority, in default all such expenses in and about the said " proceeding or act as the County Council incur, and are not " recovered from any person, and have not been incurred in any " unsuccessful proceeding." Sec. 101 grants to the Local Government Board certain powers of direction should the Sanitary Authority be negligent in the performance of its duties. The remaining 43 sections are concerned chiefly with methods of procedure ; duties of Officers ; Byelaws, &c. In this synopsis of the New Law contained in the " Public " Health (London) Atft, 1891," I have kept close to the phraseology of the Act, and I hope the result will be of service to the Board. 31 It is clear from a perusal of these few pages that SanitaryAuthorities are now in possession of powers which properly administered will lead to great future improvements in their Districts, and which should not press with undue severity upon owners of property. In every District there are probably men known as " house sweaters." To such the new Act will be as it was intended—a terror. It is scarcely necessary to add that your Sanitary Staff will endeavour to keep pace with the great increase of work which must be the outcome of this most important enadtment. With the customary Tables recording the Meteorological Returns for the year, I conclude the statistical work contained in this Report. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH LOANE. 32 APPENDIX. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. WHITECHAPEL.

To Dr. Loane, Medical Officer pf Health for the Whitechapel District. Sir, During the year ended 31st December, 1891, 147 Samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, viz., 59 milks, 35 breads, 35 flours, 6 sugars, 2 coffees, 3 oatmeals, 1 butter, and 6 drugs. Ten of the milk samples were adulterated with water varying from 6 to 20 per cent., and one milk was deficient in cream to the extent of 22 per cent. The remainder of the articles were reported to be genuine. Two of the vendors who sold milk adulterated with 17 to 20 per cent, of water respectively, were summoned before Mr. Mead at the Thames Police Court, who dismissed both summonses. The only conviction was for milk adulterated with 15 per cent. of added water. Fine and costs together amounted to £3 8s. 8d. In the other cases the vendors were cautioned, it being their first offence. Yours obediently, RICHARD SKIDMORE WRACK, under Inspector appointecrthe Aft. 46 Board of Works—Whitechapel District, Sanitary Department. To Dr. Joseph Loane, Medical Officer of Health. Sir, According to the usual custom we have prepared a tabulated statement of the year's work, and which we hand you herewith. To give a detailed account of the whole of the work would take up a considerable deal of time. However it is necessary that we should make a few remarks upon some of the work included in such tabulated statement. During the year a large amount of entire reconstruction of drainage has been carried out, and for the purposes of record it is our practice now to make plans of all premises in which entire reconstruction of drainage is carried out under our supervision, shewing the course and the several details connected therewith. We have been enabled this year to commence a systematic house-to-house inspection, detailed reports of which have been submitted from time to time. We do not propose to touch upon the results of proceedings under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, as we understand it to be your intention to make some special comments thereon. It is gratifying to notice that there has been a considerable decrease in the number of cases of infectious diseases during the past year. The cases numbered in all 386, as against 570 in 1890, thus showing a decrease of 184. Disinfection was promptly carried out in every instance. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, RICHARD S. WRACK, THOS. P. WRACK, GEO. HARVEY, Sanitary Inspectors.
