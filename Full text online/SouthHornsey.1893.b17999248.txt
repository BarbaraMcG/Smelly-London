JACKMAN, L.R.C.P.L. the Medical Officer of Health to the District. FOR THE YEAR 1893. Printed by W. THOMPSON. ALLEN ROAD, SOUTH HORNSEY. Important Notice. Ratepayers are reminded that Licenses for Dogs, Guns, Carriages, Armorial Bearings, and Male Servants, may be taken out at Post Offices; and that under the Local Government Act of 1888, the proceeds belong to the County in which they are paid. The following is a list of the Post Offices where Ratepayers can obtain the Licenses above mentioned, viz 279, GREEN LANES. 72, ALLEN ROAD. 39, HIGH STREET, STOKE NEWINGTON. and your Board hopes that every Ratepayer taking out such Licenses will do so in their own County, so that Middlesex reaps the benefit of the payments. The Board Room is available for the use of the Ratepayers by the Board's sanction. 3 Report for the year 1893. Extent.—This District comprises that portion of the Parish of Hornsey, in the County of Middlesex, which lies between the Seven Sisters Road and the High Street, Stoke Newington, having an area of 230 acres. It adopted the Local Government Act and became an Urban Sanitary Authority in the year 1865 ; in which respect it preceded the remainder of the parish, which did not take this important step until 1867—two years later. Parks and Open Spaces.—This District is well provided for in the way of open spaces. Clissold Park, of which about 30 acres are situated in South Hornsey, is nearly central, and is of easy access to the whole of the inhabitants. To the acquisition of this Park in 1888, South Hornsey contributed £6,000, of which £5,771 is still owing. Finsbury Park, also in the Parish of Hornsey, although immediately beyond the boundary of the South Hornsey District, is also readily accessible from any portion of the District. Population and Rateable Value.—The population of the District, according to the census in 1891, was 16,892, and is now calculated to be 17,150. The density of the population is 74 to the acre; this by comparison with the other Urban Districts in Middlesex, appears to be high, and some have erroneously supposed that as a District, South Hornsey is overcrowded. This is not the case, but it is fully developed, there being no pasture or waste lands. That the District is not densely populated is seen at once by comparison with the adjoining Metropolitan District, Islington, where the density is 102 to the acre. The present rateable value is £90,179. Gas Supply.—The gas used in the District is supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company. There are 244 public lamps in the District, which were lighted at the cost of £724 5s. lld. for the twelve months. Gas to private consumers was supplied at the rate of 3s. ld. per 1000 cubic feet. A new refuge and lamp were fixed at the end of Queen's Eoad in Green Lanes, and an additional lamp was fixed and put into lighting in Henry Road. Water.—The water for street watering and house supply, &c., is supplied by the New River Company; the amount used for the first purpose during the past year (1893), was 4,172,000 gallons, which, at 8½d. the 1,000 gallons, cost £166, against 3,491,000 4 gallons used in 1892, and 2,657,000 gallons used in 1891. The water is supplied to private consumers according to assessment. Drainage.—The District is drained into the Metropolitan Bystem, for which £1,129 6s. l0d. was paid to the London County Council during the year, which is a pro rata contribution based upon the assessments of the contributory authorities, including the Metropohtan Vestries of London, the Local Boards for the Districts of South Hornsey, Hornsey, Beckenham, Tottenham, &c. Fire Brigade.—During 1893 the Fire Brigade received 65 calls to fires as follows— Chimney Fires 20 House Fires in District 9 ,, out of „ 15 False Alarms 21 65 The amount paid in wages for night firemen at the fire stations in Milton and Somerfield Roads was £145, and for repairs, maintenance, etc., £69, making a total of £214, not including the horsing of the engine; of this amount £33 was recovered. Materials.—The following road materials were used during the last financial year— main roads. other roads. Granite 140 31 Flints — 651 Hoggin 56 173 The Granite is supplied by contract at 16s. 6d. per cubic yard, the Flints at 7s. 6d., and the Hoggin at 5s. 9d. The High Street was channelled at a cost of £102. Dusting.—The dust and house refuse is removed by contract at an annual cost of £575. A system of weekly removal of the dust from houses is gradually being extended, so as, if possible, to include the whole District. In order to secure prompt removal of dust, particular attention should be given to page 16. The requests for removal received during the year numbered 997, as against 1,024 in 1892, and 1,833 in 1891, thus shewing a gradual improvement. Sanitary Work.—In order to enforce the notices issued by the Board to abate nuisances, five summonses were issued ; in three cases the summonses were afterwards withdrawn, the work being done previous to the day of hearing, and the costs paid ; in one cafe the 5 house was ordered by the Magistrate to be closed; in the other case a tine of £1 2a. 6d. was inflicted. As will be seen from the table on page 18, a large amount of Sanitary Work has been carried out, including the periodical inspection of the Bake Houses, Slaughter Houses and Private Schools. Infectious Disease.—During last year the negotiations for a joint Infectious Hospital with Enfield were abandoned, the terms submitted to this Board for acceptance having been withdrawn by the Enfield Local Board. Every effort has since been made to secure a suitable site, and at the present time there is good reason to believe that in the near future, the District will be well provided for in this respect. During the year £172 was spent in isolating cases of infectious disease, fumigating rooms, clothing, etc. • Health.—Considering that South Hornsey is the most densely populated Urban Sanitary District in Middlesex (being 74 to the acre, the next being Tottenham with 23.7 to the acre) it can claim to be a very healthy district; the death rate according to the last comparative statement, being seventh from the lowest of the 25 Urban Sanitary Districts in Middlesex, most of which are rural or semi-rural in character. Temperature.—The exceptional heat and drought of 1893 caused the items for watering, and paving to be excessive, the latter, owing to the irregular shrinkage of the ground. This also affected the house walls—the 27 notices having reference to dangerous structures, being chiefly from this cause. Proposed Annexation.—On the 16th May, 1893, the London County Council made a representation to the Local Government Board, that it would be advantageous that a portion of the Parish of Hornsey, including the whole District of South Hornsey, should be annexed to the County of London. Your Board, however, on considering the matter, came to the conclusion that the advantages of the proposed annexation would not benefit South Hornsey, and unanimously passed a resolution protesting against the proposal, appointing a Committee to resist the same. This view was endorsed by the Ratepayers themselves, first through a deputation which attended one of the meetings of the Board, and secondly by a petition, which, in a very limited space of time, was signed by 1585 Ratepayers. In the event, the London County Council withdrew their petition, but not until every preparation had been made to oppose their interference with this District. 6 Report of the Medoical Officer. To the South Hornsey Local Board of Health. Gentlemen,— The population at the present time of South Hornsey is 17,150; and the number of deaths registered as having taken place in the district during the past year was 226, consisting of 103 males and 123 females, this is equal to a death rate of 13.1 per 1000 persons living ; it is somewhat larger than the previous year, when the deaths were 214 and the death rate 12.5. In London the death rate was 21.3 and in the outer ring 15.4. The births during the same period were 407—viz: 209 males and 198 females, there were 18 more births than in the previous year. The birth rate was 23.7, in London it was 31.0 and in the outer ring 29.6. The Zymotic class of diseases was the cause of SO deaths. Of these 9 were from Diarrhoea, 9 Diphtheria, 3 Scarlet Fever, 2 Whooping Cough, 2 Measles, 2 Croup, and 1 from each of the following viz., Influenza, Fever and Erysipelas. The Zymotic death rate was 1.8 per 1000. In London it was 3.08 and in the outer ring 2.5. The Zymotic death rate was less than the preceeding year when it was 2.7. Eight deaths occurred from the Zymotic class of diseases during the last quarter ot the year, 2 were from Scarlet Fever, 2 Measles, 2 Diphtheria and 1 from Fever and Influenza. Sixty-three persons died during the year aged 60 years and upwards. It is about the average for many years. The number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 56 and the infantile mortality rate was 137 per 1000 births or 3.26 per 1000 persons living. The number of cases of Infectious Diseases notified during the year was 256, viz; 158 from Scarlet Fever, 65 Diphtheria, 20 Erysipelas, 7 Fever, 4 Membranous Croup, and 2 Small Pox. These cases were all visited and inquired into by your Sanitary Inspector and, when considered necessary, werealso visited by your Medical Officer of Health, and all precautions taken to prevent them spreading, and any sanitary defects discovered were remedied. On referring to Table No. 8, will be seen the amount of Sanitary work done during the year. 150 premises were cleansed and disinfected, and the number of houses inspected were 480. It is with pleasure that I am able to point out the highly satisfactory state of your District, the death rate still continues to be one of the lowest in or around London, and that, although it is the most densely populated District in the County. I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, THOS. S. H. JACKMAN. June, 1694. 7 TABLE 1.
