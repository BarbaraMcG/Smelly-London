DIPLOMATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS, LONDON. PAST PRESIDENT OF THE METROPOLITAN BRANCH OF THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY OF MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH. MEMBER OF THE SANITARY INSTITUTE. DEPUTY CORONER FOR NORTH EAST LONDON. LATE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE PARISH. LONDON: Thomas Bean & Son, Phcenix Works, Golden Lane, E.C. 1901. 3 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FIN SBUR Y. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my sixteenth Annual Report dealing with the Health, Sanitary condition, Vital and other Statistics of the Parish of St. Luke, Middlesex, now forming the greater portion of the Eastern Division of your Borough ; and it may interest you to know that this Report is the 44th, and last of the series, the first 28 having been furnished by my predecessor, Dr. F. W. Pavy, who was also the first Medical Officer of Health to the late Vestry, he having been elected to that position soon after the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855. The Sanitary District of St. Luke comprised an area of 240 acres, including Open Spaces, the Basin and Waterway of the Regent's Canal. The number of separate Assessments in the district were 6,538, of which 3,089 were occupied as dwellings. The Statistics of Marriages, Births and Deaths contained in this Report, relate to the fifty-two weeks ending December, 1900, and are calculated upon a population, estimated to the middle of the year, of 39,790, being a decrease upon the ascertained population at 1896 of 1,737 persons, and a rate of decrease which has been steadily maintained for the past 35 years as indicated by the following figures :— The population of the Parish at the Census of 1871 was 54,969 1881 „ 46,849 1891 „ 42,440 1896 „ 41,527° *Since this Report has been in course of preparation a preliminary return giving the result of the recent Census has been furnished, which shows a further reduction in the population as follows :— Census, 1901. City Road Sub-Registration District 25,404 Finsbury „ 9,970 Total for the Parish 35,374 4 For the purposes of the Registration of Births and Deaths, the Parish was formerly divided into four Sub-Districts until 1891, when upon the death of one of the District Registrars the Registrar-General availed himself of the opportunity to unite the two Sub-Registration Districts on the North side of Old Street under name of the City Road District. Towards the end of 1900 a the further opportunity was taken to unite the Sub-districts on the South side of Old Street under the name of the Finsbury District, so that the Parish is now divided into two, known respectively as the City Road and Finsbury Sub-Registration Districts.** The later change, however, only having taken place at the fourth quarter of the year, I propose for the purposes of this Report to deal with the Statistics in the same manner as during the past nine years, i.e., by continuing the old divisions, the population of which is estimated as under:— Estimated Population Population at at Midsummer, 1900. Census, 1896. City Eoad District 29,487 29,897 Whitecross Street District 6,818 7,595 Finsbury District 3,485 4,035 39,790 41,257 Upon the above figures it may be noted that the decrease in the population, which for several years affected the South side of Old Street only, is now making itself manifest in the Northern portion of the Parish also, but to a less extent. Marriages. The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Luke during the year was 233; the number of persons married being in proportion to 11 "7 per 1,000 of the population. The number of Marriages for the previous two years was 417 and 260 respectively. The Metropolitan Marriage rate for 1900 was 17'6 per 1,000 of the population. »<> The Registrar for the City Road Sub-Registration District having recently resigned, the Guardians of the Holborn Union, with the approval of the Registrar General, decided to unite the two Registration Districts, so that in future there will only be one Registrar of Births and Deaths, and the whole Parish will constitute the St. Luke Sub-Registration District. 5 Births. The Births registered in the Parish during the year numbered 1,814 923 being boys and 891 girls. Of the total number 580 were born in the City of London Lying-in Hospital, but as only 52 of the mothers were permanent residents in the Parish of St. Luke, a deduction of 528 from the total number has to be made, leaving 1,286 the actual figures which represent the births to be credited to the Parish, and, after allotting 52 to the respective districts in which the parents resided, the births of the several sub-districts were as follows In the City Road Sub-Registration District there were 1,022; in the Whitecross Street Sub-Registration District 202, and in the Finsbury Sub-Registration District 62. In relation to the estimated population the Births per 1,000 were— For the whole Parish 32.31 City Eoad Sub-Registration District 34.65 Whitecross Street „ „ 29.62 Finsbury ,, „ 17.79 The number of births in excess of deaths during the year 1900 amounted to 211. The number of births registered in London during the year amounted to 130,868, giving a birth rate of 28'6 per 1,000 of the population, and forms the lowest birth rate in London ever recorded, nevertheless the number of births over deaths was 44,861, the average for the previous ten years having been 46,572 per annum. Deaths. The Deaths from all causes, registered during the year, belonging to St. Luke numbered 1,075, including 485 parishioners who died in institutions outside the Parish, but exclusive of 95 non-parishioners who died within our parochial boundary. Of the 1,075 582 were males and 493 were females, a number which yeilds upon the estimated population a Death-rate equal to 27.00 per 1,000 persons living, and 1.44 less than the preceding year, when the rate stood at 28.44 per 1,000. 6 Infant Mortality. Of the 1,075 deaths of parishioners, 250, or 23.2 per cent, occurred to infants under 1 year of age, and 394, or 36.7 per cent., were under 5 years. Mortality over 65 years of age:—237 parishioners were over 65 at the time of death, being at the rate of 22.0 per cent, of the total deaths recorded. The Metropolitan Death-rate for the year was equal to 18.8 per 1,000 of the population, being one of the lowest death rates hitherto recorded. The average death-rate for 10 years having been 19.8. The 95 deaths of non-parishioners occurred at the following Hospitals and other places in the Parish:— City of London Lying-in Hospital 17 Eoyal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest 60 Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital 5 St. Luke's Hospital for Lunatics 7 St. Marks'Hospital for Fistula 4 Hotels in Finsbury Square 2 95 Hospitals, Asylums, Infirmaries, Workhouses, and other Institutions and places situated outside the Parish at which Parishioners died during the year:— Asylum for Imbeciles, Banstead 1 ,, ,, Caterham 4 ,, ,, Darenth 3 ,, ,, Leavesden 6 ,, Lunatics, Bethnal House 2 Cane Hill 1 ,, ,, Colney Hatch 3 ,, ,, Dartford 1 ,, ,, Han well 7 Ilford 1 Central London Throat and Ear Hospital 1 Evelina Hospital 1 Friedenheim 1 German Hospital 1 Guy's 1 7 Holborn Union Infirmary, Archway Road 179 ,, Workhouses, Mitcham and Shepherdess Walk 146 Home of the Good Shepherd 1 Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, W.C. 6 ,, „ Paddington, W. 1 ,, Women, Euston Road 1 King's College Hospital 4 London ,, 3 Maternity ,, 1 Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals 16 Middlesex Hospital 2 Mildmay ,, 1 River Thames 1 Royal Free Hospital, Gray's Inn Road, W.C. 3 St. Anne's House, Stoke Newington 1 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 82 St. George's ,, 1 Temperance ,, 1 West London ,, 1 485 The above deaths are referred to in an early paragraph of this Report as those of parishioners who died in Institutions outside the Parish, and it will be seen that they constitute a considerable proportion of the total deaths, viz., 45*1 per cent. The list of such deaths is furnished to me weekly from the Registrar-General's office and is therefore official, nevertheless, I have from time to time had reason to doubt its correctness, more especially of those persons who have died in the various establishments belonging to the Holborn Union, and who are for the most part simply described in the list as of " St. Luke's." The result of enquiries has been to prove that my doubts have been well founded, and that not more than 20 per cent, of the cases described as of St. Luke's really belong to this Parish. Inquests. Ninety-nine Inquests were held on the bodies of parishioners during the year, being at the rate of 9.2 per cent, of the total deaths. Seventy-two enquiries (2 being as to the cause of death of non-parishioners) took place at the Coroner's Court belonging to this Parish, and the cause of death was ascertained by postmortem examination in 48 instances, 8 The remaining 27 enquiries were held at Hospitals and Institutions outside our parochial area. Of the total Inquests the verdicts were recorded as follows: Death due to Natural Causes 48 Accident or Neglect— Deaths due to Injuries the result of blows, falls. &c 9 ,, ,, from burns, scalds, &c. 7 „ ,, ,, being run over 4 ,, ,, „ Hernia 1 ,, Accidental Shooting 1 ,, ,, Drowning 2 ,, ,, Suffocation in bed with parents 14 ,, Misadventure by improper feeding 1 ,, Alcoholic excesses 10 ,, Suicide by Hanging 1 „ ,, Railway Train 1 99 Returns of Sickness and Mortality. On pages 14-24 the following tables will be found. Nos. 1 to 4 being the new tables adopted and issued by the Local Government Board, with the object that the tabular statements of sickness and mortality should be made on a uniform plan in all the Sanitary Districts. Table 1 relates to the number and rates of births and deaths under one year, also of all ages and the data upon which the death rate is based, also for the purpose of comparing the corresponding figures for the previous ten years. Table 2 contains births and the deaths corrected by the exclusion of non-parisliioners who have died in public institutions within the Parish, and the inclusion of parishioners who have died during the year outside the sanitary area, and distributed among the localities to which the deceased belonged, this table also shows the corresponding figures for the previous ten years. Table 3 deals with the cases of infectious disease which have been notified during the year, classified according to the ages of the patients and the localities in which they resided, also the number of such cases removed to hospital. 9 Table 4 provides for the deaths during the year from various causes, classified according to ages and localities. Table 5 is a return prepared by Mr. Garstang, the Vaccination Officer of the Holborn Union, setting forth the number of cases of successful vaccination as far as relates to children whose births were registered during the year ending June 30th, 1900. The figures show that those not yet found in consequence of removals, &c., number 117 out of a total of 1,844, being 11.7 percent., a deficiency considerably less than in the preceding year. It will also be seen from this return that in four cases only was exemption claimed under Sec. 2, known as the Conscientious Objection Clause of the Vaccination Act. Sickness and Deaths due to the Principal Zymotic or Communicable Diseases. Small-pox.—For the sixth successive year I am in a position to report that no death from this cause has occurred to any parishioner of St. Luke, nor has any case of sickness from the disease been notified. The Metropolis furnished 4 deaths from Small-pox against 3 for 1899 and 1 for the year 1898. 82 cases of Small-pox were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals during the year. Scarlet Fever was the registered cause of deaths in London in 361 instances, being the smallest number recorded from this disease since 1891, and being at the rate of 0'08 per 1,000 of the population living as compared with 0'20, the average rate in the 10 years immediately preceding; of these 361 deaths, 305 or nearly 84 per cent, occurred in public institutions. Belonging to our own district, 2 deaths were certified, both of which took place in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals. This is a more favourable return than for the year 1899, when the deaths numbered 7. The returns of sickness from the same cause were also less, and have been gradually decreasing during the past five years, the numbers being 94 for 1900, and 158 for 1899, and 197 for 1898, and 234 for 1897. 10 Diphtheria caused the deaths of 13 parishioners against 8 for 1899, and 21 for 1898, and this record bears favourable comparison with that of adjoining sanitary districts. 1,558 deaths occurred in London during the year, and were equal to a deathrate of 0*34 per 1,000, as compared with 0.51, 0.39 and 0.43 per 1,000 in the three preceding years. 78 cases of Diphtheria (inclusive of one of Membranous Croup) were notified as occurring in the district during the year, 73 of which were removed to Hospitals and at which the 13 above mentioned died. Fever.—Under this heading 7 deaths were registered as belonging to the Parish, 6 being ascribed to Enteric or Typhoid and one to Puerperal Fever. The case of Puerperal Fever and three of the Enteric belonged to City Road, one to Whitecross Street and two to the Finsbury District. Four of the Enteric cases died in public institutions. The table of infectious sickness shows that 32 cases of Enteric and one of Puerperal Fever were notified during the year against 31 of Enteric and one of Puerperal Fever during the previous year. 11 Admissions and deaths at the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, and the London Fever Hospital of persons suffering from Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria and Enteric Fever, 1890-1899:— Years. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Admissions. Deaths. Admissions. Deaths. Admissions. Deaths. Admissions.

During the previous three years respectively 13, 24 and 27 deaths were certified. The deaths from this disease in London numbered 1,948, and was equal to a death-rate of 0.43 per 1,000 living, the mean rate for the previous ten years having been 0.53 per 1,000. In the Registrar-General's Annual Summary just issued, St. Luke is classed amongst the London Sanitary areas which during the past year yielded the highest death-rate from Whooping Cough, viz., 0.86 and was only exceeded in Limehouse with 0.95 per 1,000. Whooping Cough not being a notifiable disease, I am unable to state the amount of sickness due to it during the year. 12 Measles.—For the same reason as that mentioned in reference to whooping cougli the degree of Measles can onlj be judged by the number of deaths ascribed to it, but it is satisfactory to note that it is credited with having been the cause of 26 deaths only against 37 in 1898. The number of deaths in 1899 was 25. The Registrar-General's Report shows that Measles was the certified cause of 1,936 deaths in the Metropolis against 2,143 in 1899 and 3,075 in 1898, and the death-rate was equal to 0.42 per 1,000 as compared to 0.62, the average for the previous ten years. Influenza.—Twenty-two deaths were ascribed to this disease during the year against 30 for 1899 and 10 for 1898. The deaths occurring in London from this cause numbered 1,950, being the greatest number recorded since the epidemic of 1895. Phthisis.—There was a marked decrease in the number of deaths from Consumption during the past year as compared with the preceding year. The number which occurred in the Parish was 89, of which 34 occurred at the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, but 31 of these being non-parishioners may be deducted. On the other hand, 69 parishioners died from the malady in institutions outside the parochial area, making a total of 137 belonging to St. Luke against 144 for the preceding year, and equal to a death rate of 11.8 per cent, of the total deaths (1,075.) The proportion of deaths due to Phthisis during the previous 5 years was as under:— Total Deaths. Deaths from Phthisis. Rate per cent. 1899 1151 144 12.5 1898 1053 106 10.0 1897 1047 126 12.0 1896 1055 118 11.1 1895 1216 108 8.8 It will be seen that with a single exception the deaths from Phthisis showed a tendency to increase each year until the year under consideration, when a marked improvement took place, nevertheless the Registrar General reports that St. Luke still occupies an unfavourable position amongst the London Sanitary Areas with respect to deaths from this cause, viz.: 3.16 per 1,000 persons living, and is only exceeded bv the Strand with 3.26 and in St. (ieorge the Martyr, Southwark, with 3.66 per 1,000, while Hampstead only yeilded 0.85, Lee 0.96 and Stoke Newington 1.04 per 1,000. 13 In continuation of the work commenced at the early part of 1898 enquiries have been made respecting every death certified as due to Phthisis during the past year, the scope of such enquiry having relation to the occupation, habits and environment of the deceased person. The co-operation of Medical men practising in the District has also been solicited and an offer made in every case of death due to this, as in every other infections case, to disinfect the rooms, bedding, clothing, &c., but such offer has only been accepted in five instances out of 127 deaths from the disease, while the leaflets and cards setting out the precautions to be adopted for the prevention and spread of the disease have been freely circulated throughout the District, with the special assistance of the clergy and ministers of the various denominations. 14 TABLE I.

For the year 1899 the sum of £35 8s. 6d. was paid. The Yestry is recouped for this expenditure by the Metropolitan Asylums Board (out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund), to which Board a copy of each certificate is sent within 12 hours of the receipt of the same. 26 Houses Let in Lodgings. Bye-laws relating to the above have been in operation in this District since 1896, but then resulted only in a small number of houses being registered in consequence of a clause fixing the rent payable. This clause was eliminated in 1898, when it became practicable to increase the number of registrations very considerably as follows :— 1896 16 houses were Registered. 1897 0 1898 0 1899 125 1900 34 175 houses now on Register. The Vestry, through its Public Health Committee, having caused all the houses which they deemed most desirable to be registered then ceased active operations owing to the changes caused by the London Government Act, 1899. That the bye-laws were strictly obeyed was proved by surprise visits (between 1 and 4 a.m.), being paid to some of the houses where they were most likely to be disregarded, with the result that no serious infringements were found to exist. Housing of the Working Classes. During the past year I reported upon what I regarded as the most insanitary areas in the Parish, they were ten in number, five being situated on the north and five on the south side of Old Street. They were visited by Mr. Shirley Murphy, Medical Officer of the London County Council, and submitted for the consideration of the Housing Committee of the Council, who decided to deal with the following four areas under the first part Housing of the Working Classes Act, viz. : Garden How, Roby Street, Baltic Street and Honduras Street areas, and suggesting the Vestry should deal with the other six smaller areas under the second part of the Act. In due course I made an official representation to the Council respecting the above four areas and a public enquiry was held concerning them at the Vestry Hall on the 29th and 30th of March. These four areas were not, in my opinion, the most insanitary of the ten, but were, I understood, selected by the Committee as they afforded the greatest facilities 27 for the purposes of re-housing the displaced inhabitants. The following is a summary of my report of the four areas and the data upon which I arrived at my conclusions respecting them. Deaths and death rates for the Parish and the several areas for the 5 years 1895-6-7-8 and 9, inclusive. In the St. Luke's Sanitary District the total deaths were 5,522, equal to 1,104 per annum, being 26.57 per 1,000 of the population, 43.9 per cent being of children under 5 years of age. The four areas represented have a total population of 1,193. There were 243 deaths, an average death rate of 40.7 per 1,000 per annum. The Phthisis death rate was equal to 5.36 per 1,000 per annum. Dealing with the several areas :— Gabden Row.—Area about 1 acre. Contains 69 houses- Population 407. Deaths 50 90. .55.5 per cent. over 5 „ 40 under 5 years af age. Average total deaths 44.2 per 1,000 per annum. Roby Street.—About f of an acre, 50 dwellings. Population 218. Deaths 17 under 5 years Infant deaths, 53.1 per 18 over 5 „ cent. Total deaths 32.5 per 1,000 per annum. Baltic Street.—About 2/3 of an acre. Contains 55 buildings. Population 351. Deaths - 32 under 5 years Infantile death (42 over 5 „ rate 44.7 per cent. Total deaths 42.1 per 1,000 per annum. Honduras Street.—About ¼ of an acre, and contains 17 houses. Population 217. Deaths 15 under 44. Infantile deaths r 129 over 5 „ 34.9 per cent. Total death rate 40.5 per 1,000 per annum. In June last I prepared the following report at the request of the Public Health Committee of the Vestry, dealing with the six smaller areas which had been remitted from the London County Council for the Vestry's action under Part 2 of the Act. To this report an appendix is added showing what Sanitarydefects (if any) were found to exist at the time of inspection, the number of rooms in each house and their several dimensions, 28 how the same were used (whether as sleeping rooms only or as sleeping and dwelling rooms combined), the number of occupants to each letting and whether the premises were registered under the bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings. To the Public Health Committee. Gextlemen,—In accordance with the Resolution of the Public Health Committee of April 24th, 1900, I beg to submit the following report dealing with the six small areas submitted for the consideration of the London County Council. They are situated: three on the south side of Old Street, and are known as Beckford Square, Tilney Court and Young's Buildings (in the latter area is included two houses in Old Street and eleven in Whiteeross Street); and three on the north side of Old Street, known as Central Street (comprising Nos. 2 to 36 in that thoroughfare, two houses in Old Street, being Xos. 81 and 83, Whitby Court at the rear of Central Street, and two houses in Mitchell Street, being Nos. 2 and 4). Bastwick Street Area comprising Xos. 13 to 38 in that Street, and Ludlow Street, the houses of which back on to Nos. 2 to 30 in (lee Street, and by which they are rendered insanitary by reason of their closeness thereto. One hundred and thirty-five deaths occurred in the six areas during the past five years, of which 86 occurred in the northern and 49 in the southern area. The total deaths equalled 31.5 per 1000 per annum of the population, and dividing these figures between the two districts the death rate was 30.6 per 1,000 in the north and 32.8 in the south. The deaths of children five years of age and under numbered fifty-nine, being at the rate of 43.7 per cent., and from phthisis the death rate was 30.3 percent. Average death rate from same cause was 10.8 per cent. 29 The death rate for St. Luke's for five years averaged 26.5 per 1,000, 43.9 per cent being under five. Beckford Square is a cut de sac, approached by an archway formed by two houses in Old Street. It consists of an open courtway containing fourteen houses, seven on each side, each house having four rooms situated one above another, and occupied by four families each. There is practically no means of through ventilation, as there are only small gratings in the back walls on the staircases, close to which are the high walls of adjoining buildings. There are no yards. The W.C.'s (4) are situated in the open courtway. All these houses are registered, and contain on an average 13½ persons to a house. The total deaths in five years numbered the twenty-four. There are fifty-six families (166 persons) living in the area. The death rate was equal to 28.9 per 1,000 per annum. Deaths, five years and under, averaged 29.1 per cent., and from phthisis 25 per cent. Six cases of infectious disease were certified, and sixteen sanitary complaints were received during five years. Tilney Court is a narrow paved way, approached by an archway between two shops, and contains nine small houses, five on the east and four on the west side; the former have been closed for eight years, having no W.C.'s. The four houses on the west side contain four rooms each—two on a floor. There are back windows to all the houses, but a high wall at rear, enclosing stable and farrier premises, limits the through ventilation. There is a high wall at end belonging to the premises in Banner Street, and the height of the houses in ()ld Street prevents a current through the courtway. The houses are occupied by four families each chiefly costermongers. The ground floor is below the paved way, and is unventilated ; the paving is bad. There is a small yard to each house, averaging 15 feet by 5 feet, and containing a W.C. The houses themselves are in fair repair, and being much overcrowded, notices have been served to abate. The number of inhabitants is thirty-seven ; the total deaths eight, equal to 4.3 per cent. half being children five years and under. 30 Three deaths were due to phthisis, being equal to 37'5 per cent. of the whole. Only two notices of infectious cases have been received and eleven sanitary complaints for the five years. Young's Buildings is a narrow turning between No. 86, Old Street (a coffee shop), and a vacant place, formerly occupied by a brewery. It consists of seven houses, six of which contain three rooms and No. 7 has four rooms, the six are each occupied by three or four families. They are in a fair state of repair, have a small yard with W.C. for each house; they have windows at the rear, but the high wall behind building in front and closed end limit the circulation of air. The site of the brewery being now vacant renders this place much more healthy than formerly. In this area is included Nos. 86 and 90, Old Street, and Nos. 189 to 209, Whitecross Street. No. 86 is the coffee and dining rooms at the corner of Young's Buildings and Old Street. No. 90 is the public-house at the corner of Whitecross Street; it contains eleven rooms and is occupied by one family and employes; there are two W.C.'s. The houses in Whitecross Street contain shops and six rooms, and cellars used for storage; they are occupied by one family each with an average of five persons ; the W.C.'s are situated in the houses in several instances, there being no yards, and the houses were shut in by the brewery buildings at rear, which buildings extended from Old Street to Garrett Street, with the exception of No. 201 (upon the owner of which a notice has been served) ; they are in fair repair. The population of this area is ninety-five. The number of deaths, during the last five years was seventeen, being equal to 35.7 per 1,000 of the population per annum; 41.1 per cent. of the deaths occurred to children five years and under. The phthisis death rate was 29.4 per cent. The number of infectious diseases notified during five years was six. Twenty-seven Sanitary complaints were received during the same period. Central Street Area includes the houses numbered 2 to 36 on the east side in that thoroughfare, Whitby Court in the rear of Nos. 20, 22 and 24, 81 and 83, Old Street, at its southern end, and Nos. 2 and 4, Mitchell Street, where that street joins Central Street. Most of the houses in Central Street are very old and 31 dilapidated, several are without yards, and the W.C.'s are in consequence situated within the buildings. Where yards exist they are very small and are partly covered over, causing the ground floor back to be very dark, and with the narrowness of the street, which is 16 feet 3 inches at the entrance, and the greater height of the houses on the west side, prevents the circulation of air. Nos. 2 and 4 have a yard in common, in which there is one W.C. for the two houses, occupied by five adults and three children. Whitby Court contains three three-roomed houses, approached by a narrow archway, under No. 22 Central Street, 3 feet 9 inches wide, and they stand immediately behind Nos. 20, 22 and 24 Central Street, from the backs of which they are only 5 feet 10 inches. The houses in Central Street are comparatively modern and very high. The three houses have small yards, nearly all covered in by washhouse and W.C., and are bounded by a high wall so that the air of the place is stagnant and the rooms dark. The rooms are situated one above the other, and are occupied by fourteen adults and three children. Preliminary notices were served about eight years ago to close these houses, under Part 2 of the Act, and they were closed bv the owner, but as the Vestry did not proceed to obtain a Closing Order they were after a short time cleansed and re-occupied. The two houses in Old Street at the southern end of Central Street are Nos. 81 and 83. The first is situate at the east corner and is in the occupation of a glass merchant, the shop and basement being used for business purposes and storage. There are four rooms above, used as living rooms and occupied by five adults. There is no yard. A W.C. on the first floor landing and one in the basement. There a is deficiency of means of ventilation and the premises are in a dirty condition. No. 83 is a small shop with seven living rooms adjoining. The shop is let to a hairdresser. The rooms are occupied by one family. There is a yard containing W.C. The premises are in a very satisfactory condition. Two houses in Mitchell Street were included in this area. No. 2 is situated at the south-west corner and at its junction with 32 Central Street, and is in the occupation of a bookbinder as a work-place. Thirty-three persons are employed on the premises, of whom eighteen are males and fifteen are females. There is separate W.C. accommodation for the sexes. There is no yard, consequently the W.C.'s (three) are within the premises. No. 4, Mitchell Street, is a dwelling house containing 8 rooms. There is a yard in which the W.C. is situated. The house is used for living purposes only, and is occupied by eight adults and three children. The total number of persons occupying the Central Street area is 125. The deaths during five years numbered twenty-one, being equal to 33.6 per 1,000 per annum of the persons living. Children under five formed 33.3 per cent. of the said deaths. Phthisis death-rate was equal to 4 per cent. Seven cases of infectious disease were reported and thirty-nine sanitary complaints were made during the period in question. Bast wick Street area includes the houses from Nos. 13 to 38 on the north side of that thoroughfare. It is regarded as insanitary by reason of the narrowness of the street and the greater height of the houses on its south side, and at the rear are situated an iron founder's factory and lead Merchant's premises. The houses contain from three to nine rooms; they are old and somewhat dilapidated; they accommodate three or four families each. They have back yards and W.C.'s to each, except in one instance, where there is one yard and W.C. for two houses. There are back windows to all. Where there are cellars they are unused Some of the houses are registered. The number of persons occupying the houses in question is 275. There have been thirty-eight deaths in them during the past five years, equal to 29.9 per 1,000 per annum; 52.6 per cent. of the deaths occurred to children five years of age and under. The phthisis death rate was 36.8 per cent. There have been twenty five notifications of infectious disease in five years, being equal to 9 per cent. of the population. The number of sanitary complaints during the same period has been 151 for these houses. 33 It would not be unfair to treat the whole of the houses in Bastwick Street as insanitary for the purposes of this Report, and the rates mentioned would no doubt he alarmingly increased, Ludlow Street is a narrow thoroughfare leading from Goswell Road to Gee Street. The houses contain two or three rooms. The houses are generally in an insanitary state for want of cleansing and bad paving in very small yards 3 feet wide, which contain the W.C.'s, and the wall dividing from the yards of Gee Street. At the rear are the houses in Gee Street, which also have very small yards, averaging 8 feet by 3 feet 6 inches. There are no basements, and no ventilation to floor. There are no back windows to the rooms. In front is a high wall enclosing a factory. Most of the houses are let to one family ; some, however, have two and some three families. As it is considered that the houses in Gee Street are rendered insanitary by reason of the obstruction caused to light and air by the Ludlow Street houses, I have included, for statistical purposes, the population of Gee Street houses in this Report, the total being 161 persons. Twenty-seven deaths have occurred in the area in five years, being equal to 33.3 per 1,000 per annum. The number of children under five was fourteen, equal to 51.8 per cent. of the whole. The deaths from phthisis were equal to 29.6 per cent. Eleven cases of infectious disease have been notified, and fifty-six sanitary complaints received during the five years. In the appendix to this report will be found the result of the Sanitary Inspector's visit to each house, showing what sanitary defects (if any) were found to exist, the number of rooms in each house and their dimensions, how used (whether as sleeping rooms only or as sleeping and dwelling rooms combined), the number of occupants and whether the premises are registered under the bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings. For the purposes of this report the amount of cubic space allowed is 400 feet for each person for living and sleeping purposes, and 300 feet if used for sleeping rooms only, half the amount in each case being required for children under ten years of age. 34 On reference to the summary at the end of the tables it will be seen that according to the above standard, over-crowding is not one of the defects of these areas. In a few instances rooms have been found to contain an excess of occupants, but in no case to a large extent. Taking the areas on the north and south sides of Old Sreet, it will be seen there is available space for 30 per cent. more residents in the former and 50 per cent in the latter area. Your obedient servant, G. E. YARROW, Medical Officer of Health. June 12 th, 1900. No action was taken upon this report in view of the fact that the formation of the Metropolitan Borough Councils was close at hand. 35 APPENDIX. Areas south of Old Street— Inspector, R. Adams.

I have also visited a number of dwelling-houses, factories and work-shops of which complaints were received, and in every instance in which the Vestry's notice has not been complied with, and in such cases in which summonses have been granted, I have attended the police court in support of the same.
