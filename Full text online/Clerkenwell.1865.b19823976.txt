With Table of Causes of Death, &c. To the Vestry of St. James and St John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I now do myself the honor of laying before you my Tenth Annual Report upon the sanitary state of the district, for the year 1865. The number of deaths occurring in the district from all causes, during the year 1865, was 1613. The average of deaths for the last ten years was 1497; thus the deaths were 116 more than the average. The general yearly mortality is shown below, the number of births being appended:— Deaths. Births. In 1856 1414 2179. 1857 1406 2219. 1858 1477 2220. 1859 1374 2175. 1860 1383 2279. 1861 1494 2295. 1862 1572 2287. 1863 1509 2449. 1864 1735 2224. 1865 1613 2389. Average 1497 2271. Every year a certain number of deaths of the inhabitants of the district takes place in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The number of these estimated for 1865 amounts to 122. The births which took place during the year were 2389; the natural increase of the population being therefore 776. In the preceding year, the births were 2224, and the natural increase 489; the greater increase of the year 1865 arising from the conjoint favourable causes, of a diminution in the number of deaths, and an increase in the number of births. The annual 12 average of births for the last ten years is 2271; so that the number for 1865 is above the annual average. The number of deaths from Zymotic* diseases in 1865, was 381; that for the preceding eight years having been respectively 348, 327, 329, 266, 381, 422, 411, and 435; the average being 364. Hence the Zymotic deaths were above the average, but fewer than those of the preceding three years. The number of deaths occurring from the principal Zymotic diseases was 316, that for the preceding year being 378; thus there is a diminution of 162 in the number of deaths from these diseases. The exact causes, and the numbers of these deaths, is exhibited in the subjoined table. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. (In Fever Hospital Totals.

In the preceding eight years the numbers were respectively, 663, 656, 628, 624, 707, 724, 728, and 789. 343 deaths occurred at and above 60, including 53 at and above 80; the corresponding numbers for the preceding year being 351 and 55. 293 deaths arose from pulmonary diseases, the number for the preceding year being 347. 174 deaths occurred in the Workhouse; the deaths for the last six years having been 120, 137, 160, 172, 158, and 167. 38 deaths tooks place in the House of Correction ; and 4 in the House of Detention. The numbers for the preceding year were 42 and 5. The accidental deaths were 19, against 22 in 1864, viz.: 6 from fractures and contusions, 1 from burns, 8 from suffocation, and 4 from other causes. 6 deaths arose from murder, all in infants. In 1864, 1 death only arose from this cause. 11 deaths arose from suicide, viz.:—2 from wounds; 5 from poison; and 4 from hanging. 106 inquests were held in the year; 72 upon persons dying from natural causes; 17 upon those dying from accident or negligence; 6 upon those where murder was committed; and 11 upon those dying from suicide. We have here the principal numerical facts connected with the mortality of the year. A summary of the causes of death, and the ages at which they occurred, will be found in the appended Table. The deaths were 116 more than the average, but 122 less than those of the preceding year. In estimating the mortality, the question of increase of population must be taken into account. According to the census of 1861, the population of the district was found to have increased by the number 903 from the years 1851 to 1861; so that if this rate was preserved, there would be 451 more inhabitants in the district than in 1861, making a total of 66,130. Whether this increase exists in the population, is, however, doubtful, since many houses have been pulled down, and the Model Lodging-houses, Corporation and Cobden Buildings have been constructed and occupied. At any rate, the mortality is less than that of the preceding year; the births were also more numerous. Judging from the number of births, the population would amount to 68,000. The mortality of any district in the metropolis, is to some extent, connected with that of the remaining. 14 The free intercourse between the inhabitants of the various parishes, must tend especially to the diffusion of contagious maladies. The deaths occurring in the entire metropolis during the year were 73,460, those of the preceding year having been 77,723; so that the year was healthier than the preceding year throughout the Metropolis. The most important diseases in a sanitary point of view, are the Zymotic diseases, as the mortality from them is to a great extent preventible. Assuming that the spread of these diseases by infection or contagion is to some extent unavoidable, the mortality resulting from them will mainly depend upon the sanitary state of the localities in which they occur. If the dwellings be clean, not overcrowded, the water pure, foul accumulations be prevented, and a general cleanly state of the occupants be preserved, the mortality resulting from Zymotic diseases will be small. While if the dwellings be dirty, and overcrowded, the water be kept in foul reservoirs, and offensive matters be retained in and about the house, the mortality from these diseases will be very great. It is no uncommon circumstance to enter a house, or an apartment, and to perceive at once, the Typhus-smell. Not perhaps that Typhus may be there; but if the infection should be brought into the house, it will be sure to cause great mortality, and to spread largely; and this not only in the case of Typhus, but that of any Zymotic disease. The great aim of sanitary measures is to find out these localities, and they are pretty well known, and to remove from them all unsanitary and unfavourable influences. In a poor population they are very numerous, as poverty and the general depression resulting from it, tend to render the members listless and careless in regard to the concern even of their lives. By reference to page 12, it will be seen that the mortality from Zymotic diseases has fallen considerably. A corresponding diminution in the mortality resulting from the most common and fatal of them is also noticeable. It will also be noticed that the latter mortality for the preceding 4 years amounted to very nearly the same numbers. The number of deaths occurring from Small Pox was 12; 19 cases were sent to the Small Pox Hospital in the year, one having died. As this disease prevailed considerably in the early part of the year, the hand-bills directing to vaccination and the vaccine stations, were posted freely throughout the Parish. The deaths from Measles fell remarkably from 73 to 27; 15 those from Scarlet Fever, from 94 to 57, of which 4 were registered as arising from Diphtheria. The deaths from Hooping Cough increased slightly from 71 to 88. The deaths from Diarrhoea were nearly the same as those of the preceding year, viz., 84 and 87. The occurrence of a few cases of Cholera at Southampton and Epping in the Autumn, produced some alarm, lest the disease should reach the Metropolis and this Parish. 7 deaths were registered as resulting from it here during the year; the numbers for the preceding 5 years being 1, 1, 4, 1, 2. The deaths from Consumptive diseases were 326, the number for the preceding year being 283; while those from Pulmonary diseases were 292, and in the preceding year 347. The Workhouse. In the course of a series of comments upon the condition of the Workhouses of the Metropolis, by a writer in the "Lancet," that of Clerkenwell came in for its share. The writer ably pointed out very numerous defects in the structure of the building, and in the arrangements connected with it. These were previously well-known to exist, although they cannot be too frequently alluded to; and the necessity of providing a new Workhouse has long been under the consideration of the Guardians of the Poor of the Parish, and the Poor Law Commissioners. The impossibility of finding and obtaining a suitable site, and the very heavy increase of rating which would be requisite to provide the necessary funds, have caused the Guardians to take time in their action, especially as it has not been shown that any undue mortality is the result of the present arrangements. The use of the very unsatisfactory tramp-wards has been abolished by the provision of other and satisfactory premises, in another part of the Parish. The very objectionable dead-house has also been replaced by a newly constructed one, in an open site, removed from the Workhouse. Model buildings. About the middle of the year, the Corporation Buildings in the Farringdon Road, and the Cobden Buildings in the King's Cross Road, were opened for occupation. These buildings are, in many respects, very superior to those containing the tenements occupied by the poor; each being provided with its water-closet, water-supply, and dust-shoots. But the massing together of such large numbers of people presents great facilities for the diffusion of Zymotic diseases, and 16 causes a difficulty, which may be hereafter removed, in carrying off the large amount of excretions by the drains, which consequently become frequently stopped up. During the year, 14 deaths occurred in Corporation Buildings, 5 from Zymotic diseases, among about 811 inhabitants. In Cobden Buildings, the deaths were 2, both from Zymotic diseases, among about 180 inhabitants. Moreover, the price at which the tenements are let, is above that which the really poor, who require the most perfection of sanitary arrangements, can pay. The short period during which these buildings have been opened, prevents the making of a fair comparison of the mortality occurring in them with that of the district in general. Bakehouses. The Bakehouses in the district were visited and examined by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 73 in number; and the necessary cleansings required in some instances were ordered to be effected. Slaughter-houses. The Slaughter-houses were also visited iu the same way, and the necessary improvements ordered to be made. The visitation of these renders important service, in interfering with the accumulation and retention of refuse upon the premises, and the prevention of the keeping of animals so as to be a nuisance. The Slaughter-houses were 37, kept by 36 butchers. Cow-houses. The Cow-houses were also inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 28 in number, kept by 24 cow-keepers. At the time they were visited, that terrible disease, the Cattle Plague, had been devastating the cows in the district. In 1864, the number of cows was 652. When the cow-houses were inspected in October, 1865, the number was only 153; and by the end of the year the number was still further reduced. The first cow died of the disease on the 10th of July, the remainder of a batch of 20 in one cow-yard being rapidly swept off. It is interesting to notice that out of 250 cows kept by one cowkeeper, all but 31 either died of the disease, or were killed while suffering from it, these escaping the disease or passing through it favorably. The disease prevailed in all the cow-sheds. Some 'of those which suffered least, were by no means the best ventilated. Those in which the cows were most numerous, were generally soonest infected, independently of the question of ventilation; the cause probably depending upon the exchange of the animals, and the resulting importation of the infection. 17 Sanitary Improvements. The following important Sanitary Improvements were carried out during the year:—186 feet of 9-inch pipe-sewer were laid down; 5 sewers were repaired, and 46 cleansed; 9 new gullies were constructed, 4 trapped, 12 repaired, and 241 cleansed; 32 house drains were laid down: 37 houses were drained; 27 cesspools were destroyed, filled up, and waterclosets substituted for them; 157 loads of soil were removed from the sewers and gullies; and 2 new urinals erected, 1 on Clerken well Green, and 1 at the junction of the Pentonville and King's Cross Roads.
