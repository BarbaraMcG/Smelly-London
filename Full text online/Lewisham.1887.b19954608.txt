The Board submit herewith:— 1. A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1888, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. 2. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1885-6, 188G-7, and 1887-8. 3. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1888. 4. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1888. 5. The Report of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1887. 6. The Report of the Surveyor for the year ended 25th March, 1888. LOANS. The Table of Loans referred to shows the total indebtedness of the Board to be £52,406 19s. 8d. During the financial year the Board have paid the sum of £6,177 6s. 7d. in reduction of the mortgages owing by them. They have also raised during the same period the 6 sum of £4,847 for new works and improvements; the net decrease on the year in the indebtedness of the Board is therefore £1,330 6s. 7d. The following statement of the loan debt will show the reduction made in the past five years, and the amount outstanding at the end of each financialyear in that preiod. The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1883, was £65,841. Year. Amount paid off during the year. New Loans raised. Net reduction.

The following statement is given to show the amount borrowed in each period of ten years from 1856 to 1886, and the rate at which the different loans were obtained. From 1856 to 1866 the sum raised was £32,223, at £5 per centum per annum. In the next period, to the end of 1876, the sum raised was £87,844, and the interest was £5 per cent, at the early part of the decade, and 4j and 3g at the latter part, following this, the sum of £68,268 was raised in the ten years ended December, 1886, and the interest was, in the first half of this period, 4½ and 4¼, but in the latter part it was 3½. This sum of £68,268 included £24,800 raised for the consolidation of previous loans borrowed at rates of 4¾, 4½, and 4¼, and the new loan was obtained, as stated in 1 previous reports, at 3½. The sum therefore raised for new works in the third period, from 187G to the end of 1886, was £43,168. The sums raised in the second period (i.e., 1866 to 1876) included the loans for the New Offices and for special paving works. The amount borrowed by the Board up to the end of 1886 (exclusive of the sum raised for consolidation of loans) was £163,535 The amount outstanding at Lady-day, 1886, was 56,222 Showing a total payment off the Loan Debt of £107,313 IMPROVEMENTS. The following Improvements have been effected during the year:— (A) The widening of Catford-road at its junction with the Bromley Road. (B) The formation of a road at Blackheath leading from Montpelier Row to Royal Parade. THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. This establishment—for the isolation of infectious diseases—has been maintained throughout the year in a thorough state of efficiency. In November Mr. Henry W. Jackson, who had filled the post of Medical Officer at the Hospital since 1884, resigned; and on the 25th January Mr. Harman Visger was elected to the office. Residents in the District are invited to use this hospital should any cases of infectious or contagious disease occur in their families, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging and nursing. Application for admission should be made at the Board s Offices at Catford. STREETS. The various works projected and carried out by the Board under this head will be found specified in the Sur- 8 veyor's Report. The total length of the Streets and Roads under the jurisdiction of the Board, as Surveyor of Highways, exceeds 61 miles. Nothing proves more clearly the rapid growth of the District than the continual increase in the mileage of the Streets under the control of the Board. STREET NAMING. The following Streets have been re-named:— Old Name. New Name. Park Road Beacon Road. Brandon Road Knowles Hill Crescent. Not previously named Franklin Road (a portion of) The following Streets have been numbered or renumbered:— Beacon Road Knowles Hill Crescent. Blythe Hill Lewis Grove. Canterbury Road. Rushey Green. Catford Hill Road. Rutland Road. Ennersdale Road Stanstead Road Garlies Road. Sunderland Road. Genoa Road. SANITARY. The health of the District continues highly satisfactory. The annual rate of mortality being only 13.7 per 1000, as against 19.0 per 1000, the death rate of London. The number of inhabited houses and the population continue to increase. The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1887, being— Inhabited houses—Lewisham 10,694 „ Penge 3,106 13,800 Population—Lewisham 65,768 Penge 20,655 86,423 9 Table VI., in the Medical Officer's Report, shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cow-houses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. In addition to these inspections, the annual house-tohouse inspection of houses let in lodgings, has been made under the Board's Regulations. During the months of April, May, and June 8,000 houses were visited, and notices to whitewash, cleanse, &c., were left at a large number of houses in which such works were required. The Board wish particularly to mention one matter of (the first importance, from a sanitary point of view, to the health of a District in which the population becomes more dense year by year. The collection and removal of Dust occupies 30 men and boys and 15 carts daily throughout the year, at an annual cost of nearly £3000, every house in the District being visited once a fortnight, or as near thereto as practicable. In order therefore that the removal of the Dust may be efficiently carried out at as small a charge to the ratepavers as possible, and at the same time that the District may continue in a satisfactory sanitary condition, the Board urgently request all householders to observe the following hints:— (a) To see that the men are not refused the dust on calling. (b) To burn (in small quantities at a time) all animal or vegetable refuse. (c) To place no animal or vegetable refuse in the bins, unless previously burnt. (d) To cleanse, limewash, or limewhite periodically the dustbins (e) To see that the dustbins are properly constructed, and fitted with covers. (f) To forward complaints of the non-removal of dust to the Board's Offices. 10 BAKEHOUSES. These premises are periodically inspected by the Board's Officers, pursuant to the provisions of the Factory and Work- shops Act, 1883, under which authority for such inspection is given. RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District, as given by the Metropolitan Board of Works in their apportionment of the sums required to be raised by that Board in the several Parishes and Districts in the Metropolis, for the year ending 31st December, 1887, was— Lewisham £456,956 Penge157,659 Total £614,615 Showing an increase, as regards Lewisham, on the previous return, of £13,454; and a decrease, as regards Penge, of £4,911. EXPENDITURE. It is highly satisfactory to note that the ever-increasing responsibilities of the Board entail no corresponding increase in their Expenditure. Notwithstanding the considerable increase in the mileage of the roads repaired, lighted, and watered by the Board before referred to, the amount required by the Board for its own local purposes from the Parish of Lewisham, was only £35,500, being equivalent to a rate on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year, of 1s. 6½d. in the pound. From the Hamlet of Penge £8,994 was required, being equivalent to a rate of 1s. l½d. in the pound. On the other hand, the amount raised in the District on the Precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works again showed an increase on the past year. The School Board for London Precept showed a decrease. The following comparative Table of the amount so required for the last 10 years will be found instructive at the present time: — 11  Metropolitan Board of Works.

[: SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The proceedings taken by the Board under these Acts {show that out of 119 samples of food analysed during the year 110 proved to be genuine. Ratepayers are again invited to avail themselves of the 1 facilities offered by the Board in aid of the working of these '. Acts, as set out in following notice:— The Notice referred to. 1"Thc attention of the Board having been called to the desirability of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the 1 general public in aid of the working of ' The Sale of Food and I Drugs Acts,' they have now made arrangements with the Public i Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Ileisch, of 79, Mark Lane, E.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the I District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the I Board during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble i in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of -such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident a is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. Gd., which i must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by 12 a resident for analysis, the balance of the analyst's fee of 10s. Gd. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis arc accepted in strict confidence, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the beforementioned fee of 2s. 6d. "If residents within the District have reasonable grounds for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in strict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous com munications, although the fee may be enclosed." LEWISHAM RECREATION GROUNDS. At the commencement of the year (25th March, 1887), of the proposals before the public for providing a Recreation Ground for the Lewisham and Catford portion of the District, the one which had secured the greater amount of public support embraced the acquisition of the site known as the Ravensbourne site, to which had been added the Lewisham Park site. The subject of the advisability of carrying out this proposal had been referred by the Board to the Works and General Purposes Committee on the 9th February, 1887, and on the 13th May, 1887, that Committee made an interim report to the Board, stating they were of opinion that the matter should be brought before the Vestry, and also stating that Mr. T. W. Williams, the Chairman of the Board, had promised to take an early opportunity of submitting it to that body. In pursuance of this promise, Mr. Williams, on the 17th 13 June, 1887, submitted the matter to the Vestry, and the following resolution, proposed by him, was carried by a large majority:— "That having further considered the question of the desirability of securing a Recreation Ground for Lewisham and Catford, and having had submitted to them the particulars of what is known as the Ravensbourne Scheme, this Vestry, taking all the circumstances into consideration, expresses its hearty approval of the Scheme, and also hopes that every endeavour will be made to secure the land, in whole or in part, as a Recreation Ground for the people." On the 24th June, Mr. "Williams informed the Works and General Purposes Committee of this resolution, and on the 27th July the Committee, in their report, suggested that a piece of ground on the western side of the railway, belonging to Lord Dartmouth, which adjoined lands proposed to be taken for the purpose, should be included in the scheme. The Committee also recommended that the proposal for acquiring the Ravensbourne and Lewisham Park sites having received the approval of the Vestry, should be submitted for the general approval of the Board, as a whole or in part, as might be thereafter determined, and that a memorial should be presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works submitting the scheme for their approval, and praying them to make a contribution towards the cost of the purchase of such part of the land as might be finally agreed upon. The Board having adopted the recommendations of the Committee, the Chairman stated that he had asked Lord Lewisham, M.P., to attend the Metropolitan Board of Works with the proposed deputation in support of this Board's memorial, and that his Lordship had consented so to do. On the 29th July the deputation referred to, headed by Lord Lewisham, and including the Vicar of Lewisham, the Chairman of the Board, and many others, attended the Metropolitan Board of Works, and presented the following Memorial:— 14 To the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District. Sheweth— That having regard to the rapid increase in the population of Lewisham, Ladywell, Hither Green, Catford, and Perry Hill, within this District, and to the extensive building operations which are continuously going on, or for which large tracts of land have been laid out, a movement was some time since set on foot, by certain influential ratepayers, for providing Public Recreation Grounds for this neighbourhood. The proposal met with the approval of the great majority of the inhabitants, and also received the cordial approval and support of the Trustees of the Lewisham Parochial Charities. That your Memorialists, fully appreciating the advantage to the inhabitants of the part of the District in question of wellselected Recreation Grounds in their midst, have determined to avail themselves of the provisions of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1856 (sect. 11), empowering Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards to take ground to be maintained as Open Spaces 01* Pleasure Grounds. That your Memorialists are impressed with the imperative necessity of at once taking steps to secure a suitable site for such object, owing to the great rapidity with which the land in the neighbourhood is being covered with houses, or secured for the purposes of building speculations. Your Memorialists had before them, some short time since, a proposal to take the Priory House Estate for the purpose of a public Recreation Ground, but before the necessary arrangements could be made the same was purchased as a building estate, and is now laid out with roads for building. That a suggestion was subsequently made for acquiring an Estate known as the Rosenthal Estate, but in this case, before the land could be secured, it was made the subject of speculation, and the Board felt that they could not agree to the increased price required for the ground. That your Memorialists have had under consideration a proposal for acquiring lands known as the Ravensbourne site and the Lewisham Park site, consisting of lands stretching along the course of the River Ravensbourne from Catford to Ladywell, well sheltered 15 by trees, and a piece of land near Lewisham Park. Such lands are shown and fully described in the plans herewith. The same consist in all of about 55 acres, and may be procured for the sum or price of about £30,000. That such land is situate in the very heart of the District which it is desired to serve, is well timbered, and would be accessible, not only from the main road of Lewisham, but also from Ladywell and Catford, which would give access to the large and populous districts now growing up in each direction. That this scheme has the hearty approval of the Lord of the Manor, the Right Hon. the Earl of Dartmouth; the Vicar of the Parish of Lewisham, the Hon. and Rev. Canon Legge; and the Other Clergy and landowners in the neighbourhood, by some of whom considerable contributions to the part of the purchase money to be raised locally have been promised. Your Memorialists feel confident that unless this opportunity is taken of acquiring the land it will at once pass into the hands of laud speculator-, and this, the last site suitable for the purpose in the locality, will be lost. Your Memorialists believe that the Trustees of the Lewisham Parochial Charities are prepared, subject to the approval of the Charity Commissioners for England, to apply to the purpose of the proposed Recreation Ground a very considerable sum, part of a fund at their disposal for the promotion of any public work for the general benefit of the Parish of Lewisham, or some part thereof, and that other subscript inns already promised by the public, are of such a nature that it can Ik; confidently stated that a moiety of the said purchase money will at once be raised provided the other moiety is promised by your Honourable Board. That the Vestry of the Parish of Lewisham have held a Special Meeting upon the subject, and have passed a resolution of which the following is a copy:— "That having further considered the question of the desirability of securing a Recreation Ground for Lewisham and Catford, and having had submitted to them the particulars of w hat is known as the Ravensbourne scheme, this Vestry, taking all the circumstances into consideration, expresses its hearty approval of the scheme, and also hopes that every endeavour w ill be made to secure the land in whole, or in part, as a Recreation Ground for the people." 16 Your Memorialists are of opinion that the land offered for Recreation Grounds is admirably adapted for the purpose, and they submit that the efforts which are thus being locally made for the establishment of a great public benefit are entitled to, and they are confident will, receive the countenance and co-opcration of your Honourable Board. Your Memorialists therefore request that your Honourable Board will take into consideration the proposal for establishig Recreation Grounds for Lewisham, Ladywell, Catford, and the neighbourhood, and that you will contribute one-half of the purchase-money of the same; or, if your Honourable Board consider it more desirable, that you will take the necessary steps for acquiring such lands as Metropolitan Open Spaces or Pleasure Grounds. And your Memorialists will ever pray, &c. Lord Lewisham and the Rev. II. Rhodes Bristow having addressed the Board in support of the memorial, the same was referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee of that Board. On reading the above memorial it will be observed that the Metropolitan Board were asked to contribute one-half of the cost, it being the intention of the promotors of the scheme to raise the remainder by public subscription. Accordingly, at a Meeting of the Trustees of the Lewisham Parochial Charities, Mr. Williams submitted a proposal that the Trustees should contribute the sum of £4,500 from the Herbage Rent Fund in their hands towards the cost of the purchase, and this was agreed to by the Trustees, subject to the approval of the Charity Commissioners. Donations also were freely promised in other quarters, and there is little doubt that had the necessity arisen the requisite sum would have been forthcoming within a very short time. It will be seen, however, in the light of subsequent events, that any such demand upon the public purse was unnecessary. On the loth October, the Ravensbourne site and the Lewisham Park site were viewed by the Works Committee of the Metropolitan Board, who were conducted over the ground by Members of the Lewisham Board, and the 17 whole subject had subsequently been very fully considered by that Committee, when, on the 2nd November, Mr. Williams was able to make the following statement to this Board. Referring to the two sites above mentioned, he stated that at the outset, the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Board determined to deal with the sites separately, treating them as separate Recreation Grounds. That the Committee proceeded to the consideration of the site known as the Ravensbourne site, the other proposal with reference to the site near Lewisham Park remaining on their Agenda paper for consideration at another time. That the Metropolitan Board had, on the recommendation of their Committee, not only decided to seek Parliamentary powers to acquire the site, but had decided to lay out and maintain the ground as a public park or recreation ground, and that thus a very great expenditure in that respect had been saved to this District, the Metropolitan Board's proposal th ing conditional only so far as the contribution towards the cost of acquiring the ground, this District agreeing to contribute one-half such cost. On such report to the Board the following Resolutions were passed by them:— "It was then moved by the Chairman (Mr. Williams), seconded by Mr. Whittaker, and " Resolved unanimously, that this Board has heard with much satisfaction th it the Metropolitan Board of Works has resolved to -eek Parliamentary powers to acquire land between Catford and Ladywell for a Public Recreation Ground, and «/ to lay out and maintain the same as a Public Park for ever; and this Board desires to express its cordial thanks to the Metropolitan Board of Works for its generous assistance to the District. "It was also moved by the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Whittaker, and "Resolved that this Board agrees to contribute one-half of the cost of the land between Catford and Ladywell, to be acquired for a Public Recreation Ground. 18 "It was then moved by Mr. Forbes, seconded by Mr. Jcrrard, and ''Resolved unanimously, that this Board recognises gratefully the great labour and ability which their Chairman, Mr. Williams, as their Representative at the Metropolitan Board of Works, had shown in inducing that Board to acquire the Ravensbourne land as a Park and Recreation Ground for Lewisham, and they thereby recorded their hearty thanks to him for carrying this important undertaking to its successful and gratifying position." The Scheme having, therefore, in the first place, received the sanction of the Vestry of Lewisham, having also obtained the unanimous approval of the Board, and having finally been taken over and adopted by the Metropolitan Board, it only remained to obtain the sanction of Parliament. To this end steps were immediately taken by the Metropolitan Board, and the necessary clauses were inserted in their Various Powers Bill for 1888. The provisions of this Bill authorise the Metropolitan Board to lend to the District Board the sum which the latter is to contribute towards the cost of acquiring the grounds. On the 25th March, 1888, the Board's representative at the Metropolitan Board was able to announce that the Bill had already passed the second reading in the House of Commons. Since the preparation of this Report, but before its publication, the above mentioned Bill having passed both Houses of Parliament, has received the Royal Assent, and the clauses thereof having reference to the Lewisham Recreation Ground have been referred by the Metropolitan Board of Works to its Committees, with a view to the proposals being carried into effect. PENGE RECREATION GROUND. For many years it had been the desire of gentlemen interested in the welfare of the neighbourhood to secure a Scale, 8 inches to 1 Mile.. Stanfords geog.Estab. 19 piece of land for the public use, before every open space in the locality was enclosed and built upon. So long ago as the year 1878 a Committee of the Vestry was appointed, on the motion of Mr. G. E. Dodson, to consider the subject, and at one time it seemed likely that that Committee would be able to secure a plot of about six acres near the Maple Road ; but although earnest endeavours were made to induce the freeholder to sell the land at a price which seemed reasonable to the Committee, these efforts were unsuccessful. The Committee of 1878 having failed to secure the land near Maple Road, attempted to open negotiations with the Managers of the Anerley Industrial Schools, with a view to the purchase of a portion of their extensive grounds. In this, however, they were met with an absolute refusal, and it was not until the autumn of 1885, when Mr. Dodson re-introduced the subject to the Vestry, that the question of a Recreation Ground again came prominently before the public. The result of that action was the appointment, in March, 1886, of a Committee of the Vestry for considering the means of securing a suitable Public Space within the Hamlet. Several plots of laud were then brought before the notice of the Committee, and a second unsuccessful attempt was made to induce the Managers of the Anerley Schools to meet the views of the inhabitants. In the following June, Mr. Bryce Grant called the attention of the Committee to a plot of land lying nearly opposite St. John's Church, and stated that the Tradesmen of Beckenhain Road, at a meeting, had pronounced in favour of an attempt being made to secure that plot. Accordingly the site was viewed by the Committee, and at a special meeting of the Vestry held in July, 1886, it was moved by Mr. Dodson, and seconded by Mr. Grant, "That it was desirable to purchase the piece of land near St. John s Church for a Public Open Space." At the same meeting it was moved by Mr. T. Blake, and seconded by Mr. Evers Dear, " That application be made to the Lewisham Board ot W orks for their consent to the appropriation of the Gravel Allotment 20 Fund towards the purchase of the land." This action of the Vestry was confirmed and approved at a Public Meeting of the Ratepayers, held on the 20th July, 188G, and presided over by Mr. Morgan Howard, M.P. The ground had been viewed by the Lewisham Board at their Annual Inspection of the District on the 7th July; and on the 28th day of the same month, it was moved by Mr. Dodson, and seconded byMr. Keen, " That the District Board having, at the recent Annual Inspection, viewed the site of a piece of ground lying nearly opposite St. John's Church, Penge, which site the inhabitants desire to acquire for the purpose of a Public Eecreation Ground, hereby resolve that the same be accepted by the Board, in accordance with the resolution of the Board on the 15th day of December, 1875." At the same Meeting, a resolution was proposed by Mr. T. Blake, and seconded by Mr. Bryce Grant, and carried, the purport of which was that it was desirable that the Board should be empowered to apply the sum known as the Gravel Allotment Fund as part of the purchase-money, and that the Metropolitan Board of Works be requested to insert a clause to effect this purpose in their next General Bill. On the 6th of August, 1886, Mr. T. W. Williams, the representative of this District at the Metropolitan Board, introduced to that Board a joint deputation from the District Board and Ratepayers of Penge in support of a memorial embodying the foregoing resolutions. On the 3rd day of the following November, a letter was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that they had resolved to contribute half of the cost of the land and to apply to Parliament for power to use the Gravel Allotment Fund. On the 17th of the same month the District Board passed a vote of thanks to the Metropolitan Board for their prompt and generous response to the wishes of the former Board in the matter of the proposed Open Space at Penge, and also to Mr. T. W. Williams for his successful support of the Board's memorial. It ought to have been stated that, previous to the deputation attending the Metropolitan Board, Messrs. 21 Matthews, Grant, and Dodson had called on the vendors and obtained an offer from them in writing. The total cost of the Ground, including the entrance into Laurel Grove, was £4,500, towards which the Metropolitan Board of Works contributed £2,250, to which was added £1,732 12s. 11 d., the amount of the Gravel Allotment Fund. The Vendors contributed £210, and the rest was raised by private Subscriptions. The labours of the original Vestry Committee extended over a period of fifteen months, and the exertions of the Subscription Committee, which was formed by enlarging the Vestry Committee, continued for a further period of about twelve months. The Ground was formally opened to the public on the 4th July, 1888, and much interest in the proceedings was manifested by the inhabitants The proceedings were commenced by a procession of the public Authorities from the Vestry Hall, in which the School Bands, Friendly Societies, and Elementary School Children took part. The Right Hon. Lord Magheramorne, K.C.B., Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, presided and the principal local Clergy, Members of Parliament, and others were present. The ceremonv was attended with great success, and the ground was formally declared open to the public for ever as a Public Recreation Ground. PARLIAMENTARY. The following Private Bills have engaged the attention of the Board :— Bexlcy Heath Railway Bill.— This Bill, proposing to authorise the construction of Railways at Blackheath, was opposed by the Board, on account ot its interference with certain streets there. The Bill was withdrawn. The Hyde Park Corner New Streets Bill.— The Board disapproved of certain Amendments made in 22 this Bill by the House of Lords, by which a part of the cost of maintaining certain Streets would be thrown upon the whole Metropolis, instead of being defrayed by the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and St. George's, Hanover-square. The objectionable amendments were withdrawn. The Metropolitan Board of Works ( Various Powers) Bill, 1888. This Bill contains clauses empowering the Metropolitan Board to acquire the Havensbourne site for a Public Recreation Ground. The South Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich and District) Tramways Bill, 1888.— A Bill authorising the laying of Tramways from Greenwich to Catford, through Lewisham Road, High Street Lewisham, and Rushey Green.

The Birth Rate to population was 27.23 per 1,000. In London 133,075 births were registered, the Birth Rate being 317 per 1,000, the lowest since 1849. 2 In England and Wales 880,017 births were registered, being 31.4 per 1,000, which was lower than any previous year since 1838, and 2.6 below the mean annual rate in the ten years 1877-86. Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1.87 was 1,191, being 41 more than the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality was 13.7 per 1,000.

GENTLEMEN, I beg to submit my Report on the several works executed, and the general business transacted in my department, during the past financial year. This is my Nineteenth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. '1 lie quantity of material used during the year for the maintenance of the public Road is shown in the following Table:— Division. Broken Guernsey Granite. Clee Hill Stone. Port Philip Stone. Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Parish (cubic yds.) 4632 ... 1596 ... 3724 1557 11,509 Hamlet of Penge (ditto) 711 120 ... 924 ... 106 1861 Total 6343 120 1696 924 3724 1663 13,370 From the 26th March, 1887, to the 25th March, 1888, both inclusive, the rainfall, registered at the Forest Hill Stoneyard, was as follows:— Number of day on which snow or rain fell inches. 2 1887 March 26th to 31st inclusive 0.25 11 „ April 1.84 16 „ May 1.48 3 „ June 1.16 7 „ July 0.81 12 „ August 2.01 17 „ September 2.20 9 „ October 1.30 19 „ November 3.79 6 „ December 1.49 11 1888 January 0.97 12 „ February 0.77 11 „ March, to 25th inclusive 1.85 Total 136 Total 19.92 2 Rain or snow fell on the panic number of days this year as last, but there were 2.30 inches more rain last year than this. Although the rainfall was less than last year, a great deal I of damage was done to the roads on account of the many changes from frost to thaw, and again from thaw to frost, Owing to the deficient rainfall during the hot weather the roads broke up in places through being so dry. The year, therefore, on the whole, was not a favourable one for the maintenance of roads. It has been my practice hitherto in my annual reports to give the quantity of material paid for during the year, but this year I have shown in the table the quantity actually used, which I think better. The road from the boundary next Greenwich to Rushey Green, Catford, was re-coated with granite; this took a good deal of material, which in the ordinary course would have been spread over two or more years, but I had delayed repairing this road as long as possible, as the Tramway Company was expected to break it up. The snowstorms during the winter were not heavy, but still gave some trouble. During the year there were 783 loads of dust, ashes, sand, &c., spread on the roads and paths where made dangerous by frost. The roads at present are in a satisfactory condition. ROAD WATERING. The work of watering the roads in the Blackheath and Lewisham Division was done by our own horses and men, assisted by horses and men supplied by Mr. Pickcrnell, at a contract pricc of 8s. per horse, harness, and driver per day. At Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill the horses and drivers were supplied under contract by Mr. C. Pcarce, at 7s. 9d. per horse, harness, and man per day. The horses and men at Lower Sydenham were supplied by Mr. W. Stimpson, at a contract price of 7s. 8d. per horse, harness, and man. In the Hamlet of Penge Mr. J. Craker supplied the necessary horses and drivers at 7s. 3d. per horse, harness, and man. The Board supplied all the vans and carts. The mileage of the roads watered, &c., is given in the following Table:- 3 Locality. Miles. Yards. Parish of Lewisham 47 1557 Ham let of Penge 11 1685 Total Lewisham District 59 1482 STREET LIGHTING.

In the Hamlet of Penge, 6342 superficial yards were relaid and 7950 superficial yards tar-painted. In addition to the above-mentioned quantities, 8487 superficial Yard of tar pavement were made for and laid in new streets which the Board paved and formed. ROAD IMPROVEMENT. An improvement was carried out by widening the Catford Hill Road, at the junction with the Bromley Road, opposite the Board's Offices. NEW ROAD. A short length of road, which is likely to be very useful, was made by the Beard on Blackheath, connecting the Royal Parade with Montpelier Row, in a direct line. Besides being a shorter route, it also gives a greatly improved gradient between these points. A large quantity of material was removed, and shot into the pits near the Hare and billet p.h.

Lewisham Parish. In order afford some temporary relief to the unemployed labourers, &c., the District, the Board continued their practice of the last two years, commenced the work of paving and faming Mount Pleasant Road, Ivy Lane, and Westwood Park. Porthea we Road, Relinque Road, and Maddin Road, Lower Sydenham, were not commenced by the 25th March, but have been started since. The materials for all these streets have been purchased tinder special contracts, and the labour, as far as possible, has been confined to those who were out of employment and residing within the District. Hamlet of Penge. No new street were paved and formed in Penge during the year, consequently no opportunity occurred in this way to find relief for the unemployed. The laying out of the Penge Recreation Ground, however, afforded work to many men through the winter. SEWERS AND HOUSE DRAINAGE.

Twenty-six additional manholes (acting as ventilators) were constructed in the existing Sewers, as well as 10 small manholes also acting as ventilators, which were built adjoining the flushing tanks. In building some of the flushing tanks I have adopted a 11 circular form, as faring more economical. These, as well as the square ones, are constructed almost entirely of concrete The following is a list of the Tanks built during the year:— Parish of Lewisham. LOCALlTY. Capacity of Tank in gallons.

The number of flushing tanks constructed up to Lady-day is as follows:— Lewisham 34 Penge 7 Total 41 * Small manholes which were constructed adjoining the new flushing tanks are marked with an asterisk. 13 From this it will he seen that we are steadily adding year by year to the number of flushing tanks, and this cannot fail to improve the condition of the sewers. Complaints have been made at timet of the smell arising from the ventilators of the Perry Vale Sewer, and a great deal of attention has been bestowed upon it During the year the, thermometers fixed in the connections of the Forest Mill Brewery Co. with the Perry and Church Vale Sewers were read 1791 times; and these sewers have been frequently examined. An unusual amount of disinfectants have been used in the sewers generally, and the cost of this and flushing has been very much greater than in former years. The following are the quantities of disinfectants used:— Permanganate of Potash 19 cwts. Sanitas Powder 131 tons. Jeyes perfect Purifier 301 gallons. Carbolic Acid 50 gallons. Carbolic Powder 2½ tons. The value of these disinfectants is £352. The coke fire bus been continued in the ventilating shaft Ivy Lane Sewer, with satisfactory result. The flushing men have periodically gone through and cleaned the large sewers vested in the Board and I do not hesitate to say the sewers are now in letter condition than they ever were. The relaying of a portion of the Peak Hill Sewer was completed. PUBLIC RECREATION GROUNDS. Throughout the year 1 have been engaged in preparing reports, plans, and estimates, and compiling information, &c., relative to the proposed Recreation Ground for Lewisham; this occupied a good deal of time, as different sites were considered from time to time. At the beginning of November the Chairman of the Board announced that the Metropolitan Board had determined to lay out the Ground of the Ravensbourne site, since which time that Board has been obtaining the necessary Parliamentary powers, &c., to enable them to do the work. In December the matter of the laying out the Penge Recreation Gound was referred to the Recreation Ground Snb-Committtee. I submitted three designs to them, one of which was selected and appoved by the Board; and I have now the whole 11 of the work in hand, consist in of draining, fencing, laying-out ground, tar-paving paths, constructing cottage, urinals, gymnasium, entrance gates, &c., which is nearly completed. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. There were no Surface Water Drains sanctioned. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The following Bills were deposited affecting the District:— 1. The Metropolitan Board of Work (various powers) isham Recreation Ground. 2. The Bexley Heath Railway Bill. 3. The South-Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich and District) Tramways Bill. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Various powers), Lewisham Recreation Ground. This Bill is now before Parliament, and is for acquiring about 46J acres of land adjoining the Ravensbourne, between Catford and Ladywell Railway Stations, for the purpose of & Public Recreation Ground. 1 need hardly say the schemc originated with the Lewisham Board, and what a great boon when completed, it will be to the District. The Bexley Heath Railway Bill was withdrawn. I reported fully on this Scheme. (See Min., 11th January. 1888, page in). The South-Eastern Metropolitan (Lewisham, Greenwich and District) Tramways Bill. The Bill is now before Parliament. The Board resolved to give their consent on certain conditions. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. The rainfall of the year being so small no Hooding of any consequence occurred. Nineteen communications were received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works asking suggestions upon frontage lines of building. &c., under the 75th and other sections of the Metropolis Management Act, 1862. I have prepared the annexed Table showing the result of these applications.

I was a witness in the case, and the Board obtained an order. The wall is now act back. I wish to draw attention to the increasing difficulty of obtaining shoots for road sweepings and house refuse. The shoots that have been used are being closed one after another, and I foresee that it will not be long before this refuse will have to be sent away by railway or otherwise, or land obtained to dispose of it in some way. A this means a large outlay; indeed, at the present time, the cost of the disposal of road detritus and house refuse is increasing very much. Nothing has been done by the South-Eastern Railway as to the widening of thier line (Tonbridge Branch), nor do I hear anything of the promised Station at Hither Green. Statutory notices were served on builders for ing to build before giving notice, and several summonses were taken out and convictions obtained for this and other offences. Many trees were planted on the footpaths during the year, and in some cases trees were thinned out where they had become too thick by reason of their growth. Spaces were enclosed and planted near the lewisham Cemetery Gates, and also at the junction of the Catford Hill and Bromley Roads. There are now several of these space in the district planted and maintained by the Board. A number of street name, boards and plates were put up, and tablets on the lanterns of the public lamps. 161 Plans and tracings were made; a large number of reports and estimates prepared; also a great many letters written. I have prepared a list showing the New Streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan board, which I append to this Report. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San.
