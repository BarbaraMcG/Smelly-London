URBAN SANITARY DISTRICT OF WIMBLEDON, COUNTY OF SURREY. Report of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year ending December 31st, 1894. WIM 046 Urban Sanitary District of WIMBLEDON, County of Surrey. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH For the Year ending 31st December, 1894. WIMBLEDON: printed bt edwin trim, homefield road, and hill road, Report of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year ending 31st December, 1894. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year ended the 31st December, 1894. The total number of births registered was 794 (394 males, 400 females), equal to a birth-rate of 26.4 per thousand per annum. The total number of deaths registered was 310 (l68 males and 142 females), equal to a death-rate of 10.3 per thousand living per annum, taking the population at 30,000 (the estimated population at Midsummer, 1894). It is with great satisfaction I have to state that the death-rate for the year 1894 was lower than it has been for the last 18 years. The following are the death-rate since 1877:— 1877 11.4 1878 14.0 1879 14.9 1880 14.7 1881 13.8 1882 14.9 1883 12.6 1884 13.1 1885 12.8 1886 12.6 1887 12.4 1888 10.8 4 1889 10.9 1890 10.6 1891 12.8 1892 12.8 1893 12.9 1894 10.3 The infantile mortality is lower than it has been for the last 3 years, the number of deaths of children under one year being 81, against 107 in 1893, and 90 in 1892. Between the ages of 1 and GO there were 19 deaths fewer than in 1893, and above 60 there is a decline as compared with the 3 preceding years. Influenza caused 10 deaths, against 20 last year, 18 in 1892, and 17 in 1891. The number of deaths from Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and other diseases of the respiratory system is the same as last year. The death-rate from Zymotic diseases during the year was l.50 against 2 03 last year, and 17 in 1892. The number of deaths from Zymotic diseases during the year was 45, viz.:—Measles 6, Whooping Cough 8, Diphtheria 10, Influenza 10, Diarrhoea 6, Erysipelas 1, Typhoid Fever 3, Septicaemia 1. Table A shows for the last year and the three preceding years the births, deaths, death-rates, and the deaths at certain ages and from specified causes. Table B shows the difference between the number of cases notified and the deaths from these diseases. Table C shows the death-rates from Zymotic diseases for the last nine years. Table 5 shows the localities in which all the notified cases of Infectious diseases have occurred. 5 TABLE A. 1894 1893 1892 1891 Births 794 780 738 711 Deaths 810 363 333 334 Death-rates 103 129 128 12.8 DEATHS— Under 1 year 81 107 90 76 Over 1 year and under 6O Years 147 1G6 124 159 Above 60 years 82 90 119 99 From Measles G 5 3 0 „ Scarlet Fever 0 3 0 1 „ Smallpox 0 0 1 0 „ Diphtheria 10 3 8 7 „ Diarrhoea 6 16 8 11 „ Whooping Cough 8 1 4 10 „ Enteric Fever 3 0 0 1 TABLE B.

Only one case of Small Pox was notified during the year, and that occurred in December. The patient, a young man of 28, a chemist's assistant, was removed from his lodgings in the Broadway to the Infectious Diseases Hospital. The case was extremely mild, and the patient recovered. All enquiries failed to elicit the origin of the disease. Every precaution was taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and all persons who were known to have been in contact with the sufferer were re-vaccinated. SCARLET FEVER. Scarlet Fever has been present during the whole year. The greater number of cases occurred during the months of January, February and March (see Table 2), when 41 cases were notified, but most of these were secondary cases after the epidemic of last year. The total number of cases notified was 93, of which 71 were treated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital, and the remainder in their own homes. There were no deaths from this disease during the year. In October Mrs. Penfold, of 25, De Burgh Road, was summoned at the Wimbledon Police Court for failing to notify her two children as suffering from Scarlet Fever. The Bench inflicted a fine of £1, i.e., ten shillings in each case. DIPHTHERIA. Forty-three cases were notified during the year, and ten proved fatal, against 37 in the preceding year, and 3 deaths. Of these 27 were treated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital, of which 6 died and 21 recovered. The remaining 16 were treated in their own homes, and of these 4 proved fatal. 7 The bodies of the fatal cases were removed as soon as possible to the mortuary, and the rooms from which they were removed were disinfected without delay. In only two months of the year (July and August) were no cases notified. The larger number of cases were reported in October, November, and December (see Table 2). Four cases occurred in a small private school where the drainage was found to be defective. There is evidence of polluted drinking water and defective drainage in most of the cases, but some could not be satisfactorily accounted for. TYPHOID FEVER. Thirteen cases were notified, and 3 deaths, against 1G last year, and no deaths. No cases occurred in March, May, June, July, and September. In January 2 cases occurred, one a woman aged 49 in the St. George's Road, and the other a man of 31 in Palmerston Road. The first was an imported case, and the other was doubtful. The drainage at both houses was found to be in a good condition. Both cases recovered. In February a case occurred in the Caroline Road, probably due to the very defective state of the drains. The patient (a boy aged 9 years) recovered. In April a case occurred in Amity Grove, a young woman aged 24 years. An examination showed that the drams, though new, were entirely filled with decomposing sewage matter, owing to a stoppage in the intercepting trap. The cistern containing the drinking water was also in a very foul state. Both these matters were attended to. The case recovered. In August a case was notified from Palmerston Road. The drains were in a very bad state, and the water closet was found to be flushed direct from the drinking water cistern. This case recovered. 8 A fatal case occurred in October in High Street. A girl aged 24. The drainage of this and the 3 adjoining houses was found to be in a deplorable condition. New drains were laid to all these houses and other sanitary defects remedied. Two other cases occurred in this month, but the origin of the disease could not be traced in either case. Both recovered. In November four cases occurred. The first was notified from Dryden Road. A boy aged 7 years. This case was a very mild one, and could not be traced. The drainage at the house was in good condition. A fatal case occurred in the Hardy Road. A child aged 11 months, but the child was suffering from a complication of diseases, and the drains at the house were in good condition. An imported case from London was reported in the Graham Road. A fatal case occurred in the Thornton Road, that of a builder aged 25, who was known to have been employed superintending the alterations to certain drains at a house where there haa been a case of Typhoid Fever. An imported case was notified from North Road in December This case was a serious one, but is now progressing favourably. INFECTIOUS DISEASES HOSPITAL. During the year 99 persons were admitted to the Hospital, 71 of whom were suffering from Scarlet Fever, 27 from Diphtheria, and 1 from Small Pox. The Disinfecting Chamber has done good work during the year. A charge of £1 . 1 . 0 is made for disinfecting as much as the Chamber will contain, but in many cases it was found desirable to do this work free of charge. The charge includes the cost of taking the articles to and from the Hospital. A separate vehicle is kept in which the articles that have been disinfected are returned. 9 The following Table shows the number of articles disinfected From each disease :- DISEASE. Mattresses. Palliases. Beds. Pillows and Bolsters. Blankets. Dresses. Suits. Other Articles. Total.

The Matron resigned at the end of the year, and Miss Warren, of Bromley, was appointed in her stead. Considerable dissatisfaction has been caused owing to the unsatisfactory state of the Hospital, and it is to be hoped that the current year will see prompt measures taken for the erection of a suitable building.

In consequence of complaints it was thought advisable to make a house-to-house inspection of South Place, with a view to dealing with any houses which should be condemned on Sanitary grounds under the " Housing of the Working Classes' Act, 1890." This inspection was made in April, and a report, with a plan of the houses, was submitted to the Sanitary Committee on May 2nd. A notice under the above Act was served on the owner by order of the Local Board on May 12th, but although a good deal of correspondence has been going on between the Board and the owner, nothing had been done to remedy the defects at the end of the year. Notices were served under the same Act on the owners of nine houses in South Road, and 6 houses in the Haydon's Road, and both were complied with. FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS' ACT. It will be remembered that last year a notice was served upon Mr. Oldham (the owner of No. 2, St. Mark's Place), requiring him to do certain important Sanitary work upon the premises. This notice, however, was not complied with, and proceedings were taken in the South-Western Police Court. The magistrates made an order, and the work was ultimately carried out by the Board at a cost of £39. On being applied to for payment Mr. Oldham appealed to the Local Government Board. An inquiry was held by one of their Inspectors, at which the matter was very fully discussed, Mr. Oldbam being represented by counsel. The appeal was dismissed by the Local Government Board, who confirmed the Local Board's claim. BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses, 22 in number, were inspected twice during the year, viz., in March and September. Of these 4 required whitewashing, and one had an offensive accumulation of refuse outside the Bakehouse door. 11 Notices were served on the owners in each case, and were complied with. It is satisfactory to note that these premises are on the whole kept in a very good condition. DAIRIES, COW-SHEDS AND MILK SHOPS. The Dairies, Cow-sheds and Milk shops in the District have been inspected periodically and at intervals, and with a few exceptions have been found to be kept in accordance with the regulations. There are 37 of these premises in the District, one having been registered din ing the year. In 3 cases notices were sent for cow-sheds to be limewashed. In 1 case the milk utensils were found to be improperly kept. The usual notices were served on the owners and were complied with. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The Slaughter Houses have been inspected frequently, and found to be kept in accordance with the Bye-laws. Accumulations of manure from the lairs have been prevented, and the Slaughter Houses have been inspected when Slaughtering has been in progress, with a view to seeing that the new Bye-laws of 1894 have been complied with. There are only 6 Slaughter Houses in the District, and 3 of these are not much used. PIGGERIES. A summons was issued in the South-Western Police Court against Mr. Spittle in respect of the nuisance caused by his piggeries in Durnsford Road, and Mr. Spittle was fined 40/- and costs. The nuisance, however, continued, and the Board obtained from the Attorney-General leave to take proceedings in the High Court in his name. The case was heard on the 6th and 7th of November, and an injunction was given against the defendant to prevent him committing the nuisance complained of. 12 Notices were served on the owners of piggeries in the North, South, and East Roads, to comply with the new Bye-laws, which prohibit the keeping of swine within 100 feet of a dwelling house. The result was that in the East Road 3 piggeries containing 41 pigs were abolished. In the North Roar] one piggery containing 17 pigs was removed to over 100 feet, and another with 5 pigs was abolished. In the South Road 9 piggeries containing 57 pigs wore dealt with; 5 were abolished, and 4 were re-erected outside the prescribed distance. The keeping of pigs in such numbers in these roads was a serious nuisance, and it would be a good thing if the prohibitive distance were further extended to 150 feet. SANITARY WORK The Sanitary work done this year exceeds by far that done in any previous year. Table 1 shows at a glance the summary of work. Several groups of houses have been entirely re-drained. A block of 23 houses between the Russell, Pelham, Palmerston, and Dryden Roads have been put into thorough repair, and new drainage and Sanitary fittings provided throughout. Some of the internal surfaces of the walls were very filthy, and had as many as 10 coats of decomposing wall paper on them. Similiar work was done to a row of eight houses in the Thurstan Road. Twelve houses Pelham Road Nine „ South „ Five „ Three „ Palmerston Road Four „ Five „ Durham „ Seven „ Kingston „ 13 Six houses Hay don's Road Five „ High Street Six „ Herbert Road Four „ Worple „ A large number of single houses and pairs of houses have been re-drained in various parts of the District. STORM OVERFLOWS. A 3ft. diameter surface water outfall has been constructed from Haydon's Road, nearly opposite Effra Road, to the Wandle, with a storm overflow from the low level sewer discharging into the same. So far this overflow has relieved the flooding that formerly took place in Beaconsfield Terrace. An overflow has also been constructed from the middle level sewer to the storm water sewer at the bottom of the Downs, in order to relieve the flooding that takes place in Worple Road. A sewer has been constructed for the drainage of the Northern portion of Durnsford Road. The sewage drained into this sewer is raised by two Shone's ejectors worked by waste air from the sludge presses. This sewer will afford a means of draining Wimbledon Park Farm and the houses adjacent. SEWAGE TREATMENT. The chemical part of this treatment has throughout the year been effected with lime, and an addition of copperas during the summer months, which has effected a considerable saving on the cost of the former treatment. PRIVATE ROADS. In making up private roads which had fallen into a very bad state of repair, the extent of channelling may be included amongst the Sanitary improvements effected during the year. I am glad to note that the Board have applied the provisions of Section 150 of the Public Health Act, 1875, to the making up of mews which it is impossible otherwise to have properly paved. 14 I cannot conclude my report without again testifying to the great energy and ability shown by Mr. Mayne in the many extensive and important works which have been necessary during the year in this rapidly increasing neighbourhood. Owing to his promptitude, I feel sure that several outbreaks of infectious disease have been warded off. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, E. POCKLINGTON M.O.H. 15 TABLE 1.
