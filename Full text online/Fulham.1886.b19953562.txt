By the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885, it isenacted that, inter alia, that the Vestry of Fulham be entitled to elect one person to be a Member of the said Board, and in accordance therewith the Vestry on the 25th March, 1886, proceeded to elect such member. The Member now representing the Parish of Fulham is Mr Philip Pethick Perry. BY THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION ACT, 1870, the Parish is comprised in the Chelsea Division of the School Board for London. Five Members are elected by the ratepayers of this division, and the following are the present Members of the Board:— Professor Gladstone, F.R.S., 17, Pembridge Square.

Halford Road (Temporary) Gilstead Road (Temporary) Everington Street Harwood Road. Sherbrooke Road Ackmar Road. PUBLIC LIGHTING. Gas is supplied for Street Lighting in this parish by the Brentford Gas Company, and the Gas Light and Coke Company, the former lighting the Hammersmith Road, and the latter the remainder of the parish. On the 25th August, 1886, the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Vestry appointed Dr. Cooney, and Messrs. Hutchinson and Davey, a Sub-Committee, to confer and obtain any information on the subject of the supply of gas by meter they should think fit, and to bring up a report thereon to that Committee. On the 15th December, 1886, following, the Clerk submitted the Draft of the Gas Lighting Sub-Committee's report, the consideration of which was ordered to stand over, the report in the meantime to be circulated amongst the members of the Works and General Purposes Committee. At the meeting of that Committee held on the 26th January, 1887, it was resolved that the Gas Lighting Sub-Committee's report be received, and presented to the Vestry, but that the discussion be further adjourned. The following is a copy of the Report:— REPORT OF AN ENQUIRY INTO THE LIGHTING BY GAS, By Various Local Authorities, With Recommendations for the future Gas Lighting of the Parish of Fulham, by Dr. J. E. Cooney, and Messrs. W. Davey and E. B. Hutchinson, Sub-Committee of the Works and General Purposes Committee of the Vestry of Fulham. The Parish of Fulham comprises an area of 1,716 statute acres, and has about 25 miles of carriage way, and five miles of foot paths where there is no carriage way, and an estimated population of 53,625; but taking into consideration the number of occupied houses being 9,658, at 73 inhabitants to each house, the estimated population may be between 53,625 and 70,503. There are 10,716 houses in the district, 1,058 being unoccupied. Gas is supplied by two Gas Companies at the following cost per annum— Brentford Gas Company, £36, and the Gas Light and Coke Company, £3,764. These amounts are approximate only, and the total cost of £3,800 includes supply of gas, lighting, rent, &c. The Gas Light and Coke Company charges at the following rates for street lamps, when payment is made quarterly: Winter Quarter. Summar Quarter. £ s. d. £ s. d. 5 ft.

The following further particulars given in detail will enable a better comparison to be made, should the Vestry of Fulham elect to provide and keep in repair their own public lamp posts and lamps, and apparatus connected therewith, and also in case of their electing to burn by meter, and light and extinguish the lamps as provided for in Sec. 23 of the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860.

The burners of the ordinary lamps are regulated by the Gas Company to consume five feet of gas per hour, but as there is no way of testing these regulator burners by the Vestry, and as the Company light and extinguish the lamps irregularly, the parish suffers in the matter of light, by having less burning hours, while the Gas Cas Company reaps large dividends. The following lamps burn more than five feet per hour—one lamp at Wandsworth Bridge, at 28 feet per hour, Sugg's patent lamp and burner; one lamp at Gibbs Green, at 11 feet per hour, do.; two lamps at Moore Park, at 12 feet per hour, do. There is a lamp consuming five feet over Walham Green urinal. 23 The following are metered lamps on refuges Chaloner Street Sugg's patent Broom Park Road and Varna Road (corner of) do. Fulham Cross do. Fulham Park Gardens do. Gibbs Green do. Gwendwr Road do. High Street do King's Road do. Vestry Hall do. Walham Green do. Walham Green Church do. Walham Green Station do. Walham Grove do. The gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company is tested daily by gas examiners appointed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, at places and with apparatus prescribed by the gas referees, who are appointed for that purpose by the Board of Trade. The testing place convenient for Fulham is at 1, Carlyle Square, Chelsea. The gas is required by the Companies' Acts of Parliament to have a lighting power of 16 candles when burnt at the rate of 5 cubic feet per hour, ascertained by comparing with that of a sperm candle burning 120 grains per hour, so that the street lamps in Fulham are supposed to give light equal to 16 candles. Cannel gas is said to be equal to 344 candles. As regards purity, the gas must be entirely free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and the maximum quantities of sulphur and ammonia permitted are fixed from time to time by the gas referees. The limit for ammonia is now 4 grains in 100 cubic feet of gas. Sulphur from April to October is allowed to the extent of about 17 grains in 100 feet, and from October to April about 22 grains in 100 feet. The gas has, when tested at the official testing place, been found generally to be equal in illuminating power and purity to the requirements of the Acts, and there has been no such ascertained default as to render it necessary for the Metropolitan Board of Works to ask that any forfeiture be imposed. The arrangements under which the profits which may be divided by Gas Companies among their Shareholders are made to depend upon the price at which the gas is supplied, an additional ¼ per cent. of dividend being allowed for every 1d. per 100 feet, by which the price is reduced, and conversely, the dividend being reduced when the price is increased, is still found to work satisfactorily. Under this arrangement, combined with other favorable conditions which have attended the business of gas-making in recent years, the price of gas has been lower and the dividends higher than ever before. 24 The Gas Light and Coke Company, whose price is the highest, is now charging 3/- per 1000 feet, and paying 12 per cent, dividend on its ordinary shares, the maximum rate of dividend allowable when the price is 3/- being 12£ per cent. Other companies charge 6d. less. TESTING OF GAS METERS. An Act of Parliament of 1859 regulates the measures to be used in the sale of gas, and provides for the appointment of inspectors to test all gas meters; and by an Act of 1861, the power of appointing inspectors in the Metropolis is vested in the Metropolitan Board of Works of the three testing places in London, the one conveniently situated for Fulham is in St. Ann Street, Westminster. At each place is an inspector, with assistants, who tests all meters brought to him for the purpose, a small charge being made for each, according to a scale mentioned in Sec. 19 of the Gas Act, 1859. The number of meters tested in 1885 was 88,845, and the fees received or receivable amounted to £3,190. The expenses of carrying out the provisions of the Act were about £2,880. The Gas Companies cannot be compelled to light any street with lamps at a greater distance from each other than seventy-five yards. The Gas Companies must deposit maps for inspection of Local Authorities and consumers with the Clerks of the Peace. The Gas Company shall not charge a higher price by the 1,000 cubic feet for gas supplied to any local authority than the lowest rate by the 1,000 cubic feet from time to time charged by them to any private consumers, otherwise than by special contract in writing.

Taking as a standard the statement by the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, which is a very high standard, after the first cost, there would be at least a saving of £350 a year. The following letter was received from the Gas Company:— THE GAS LIGHT AND COKE COMPANY. Horseferry Road, Westminster, S.W. 28th October, 1886. Dear Sir, Public Lamps. The Directors have no objection to sell to your Vestry the Lamps and Meters now in use in your District, and in order that you may judge of the advantages on the contrary to yourselves, I send you without reservation a copy of the Report on value which, has been made to me by our Distributing Engineer. The price he quotes (£4,645 4s. 9d.) does not include the Governors, which the Company will not sell unless you adopt the average Meter system; in which case the purchase money will be increased by 2/6 per Lamp, and power of supervision over the Governors by the Company's Officers will have to be reserved by agreement. Faithfully yours, J. O. PHILLIPS, C. J. Foakes, Esq., Secretary and General Manager. Fulham Vestry, Town Hall, Walham Green, S.W. (Copy) THE GAS LIGHT AND COKE COMPANY, 146, Goswell Road, E.C. J.O. Phillips, Esq., Secretary and General Manager. Dear Sir, Fulham Lamps. In reply to your letter of the 26th inst., there are now in Fulham Parish Lamps and Columns as follows:— Cost Price. £ s. d. £ s. d. 1000 ordinary pattern 4 6 9 each 4,337 10 0 13 Embankment do. 17 15 9 " • 231 4 9 83-light Meters in Cast Iron Boxes 6 5 0 " 50 0 0 55-light Meters in Brick Tanks 5 6 0" 26 10 0 Errors excepted £4,645 4 9 31 These all belong to the Company, who charge 5/- per Lamp per annum, for their use, amounting to £253 5s. or 5-4 per cent. As this is only bare interest on expenditure, I consider the Parish should be asked to pay the original cost price, from which 5 per cent, might be deducted. I should inform you that they have been maintained, and are now in good repair. Yours truly, (Signed) ROBERT HARRIS, Distributing Engineer. Taking again the high standard of St. George's HanoverSquare, our first cost would be about £950. At present we pay for rent of posts, meters, &c., to the gas companies £255 12s. a year, and as they ask this Vestry the cost price, £4,645 4s. 9d., for second-hand lamps, the Vestry is paying 5½ per cent, as rent. The Sub-Committee consider it far better to borrow the money at 3½ per cent., the usual price paid by this Vestry for loans, and thus save 2 per cent, or £93 'per annum on hire for lamps at once, and when the debt is paid off the whole 5½ per cent, is saved. The Vestry of Fulham is strongly recommended to avail themselves forthwith of the provisions in Sec. 23 of the Metropolis; Gas Act, 1860. They should at once (1) provide and keep in repair their own lamp posts and lamps and apparatus connected therewith, and after such are in working order (2) to burn the gas by meter, and light and extinguish their own lamps. (1.) It would be necessary to arrange with the London Gas Light and Coke Company to sell their lamps which are secondhand at a much reduced price than at present asked, and for the future to provide our own lamps either from Messrs. Pontifex and Co., 22, Coleman Street, E.C., or Messrs. Sugg and Co., Westminster, when a better pattern of lamp at a lower price may be obtained. At present we pay 3/6 per lamp for repairs and painting per annum, while St. Leonard's Shoreditch, pays only 2/This saving of 1/6 per lamp, equal to £75 a year, can easily be effected on repairs, &c. Here only the Gas Light and Coke Company is referred to,, though the Brentford Gas Company which, receives 1 per cent, of the amount of the former company's account, would be similarly treated. (2.) When the Vestry take to burning their own gas by meter, and lighting and extinguishing their own lamps, there will in the first instance be the cost of gas saved, more gas burned, and 32 the Parish better lighted, and as the cost of lighting and extinguishing costs this parish £76115s., if the plan of other parishes be adopted, the cost would be—10 men for 1000 lamps at 21/equals £546, thus saving more than £200 a year on lighting, &c. As St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, saves 13½ per cent., St. George's, Hanover Square, 8½ per cent., by the average meter system it is confidently hoped that there would be a minimum of 12 per cent, saved, or £450 out of £3,800 now spent. A reference to the Annual Report of the Vestry of Paddington on Public Lighting shows a gain of 8,132,555 cubic feet of gas by the average meter system, over the scale or contract system during the year 1885-86, a saving equal to £1,015 13s. on gas alone. In Paddington the average meter system has been in use for 13 years. Paddington has 1,910 lamps, each lamp burning 3,877 hours a, year. Fulham „ 1,020 „ „ „ 3,745 „ a year. A reference to the Annual Report alluded to will well repay perusal; further, the Clerk to the Vestry of Paddington has kindly offered to give any help that lies in his power, should this parish decide to adopt the average meter system. It would be of the greatest importance to appoint a subcommittee of the Works Committee to be a Public Lighting Committee. Your obedient Servant, J. EDWIN COONEY, Chairman of Sub-Committee to enquire into the Lighting of the Parish. December 1st, 1886. On the 2nd of February, 1887, the Vestry received the report in question, and on the 16th February, 1887, the report was passed, and referred back to the Works Committee to appoint a Public Lighting Committee. At the meeting of that Committee on the 16th of February, 1887, Dr. Cooney, and Messrs. Hutchinson, Davey, Stiles, and Hunt, were appoined such Public Lighting Committee. WATER.

In June, 1886, the Hammersmith Vestry having given this Vestry notice to quit the Wharf in Chancellors Road, Hammersmith, this Vestry applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for the site of the Old Toll House, Putney Bridge, for a wharf, who referred the application to the Bridges, &c., Committee, with Solicitor, to report on. On the 25th August, 1886, a joint meeting of the Works and Cartage Committees was held, and a Sub-Committee appointed to consider the whole question of wharfage accommodation, and the Surveyor was instructed to prepare a report thereon to be taken into consideration at a meeting to be held on the 17th September, 1886, following. On that day the Surveyor reported on four sites—including that of the Old Toll House, Putney Bridge—and, after full consideration, it was resolved to await the reply from the Metropolitan Board of Works. 36 DIVERSION OF CHURCH PATH. On the 5th January, 1886, the Vestry, having received through the late District Board of Works an application from the United Land Company to stop up Church Path, appointed a Committee to view the path and report thereon to a future meeting of the Vestry, and, on the 2nd February, 1886, following, the Committee reported recommending that permission be granted to divert a portion of Church Path on condition that the company pay to the Vestry the sum of £200, and enter into an agreement with the Vestry to make a kerbed and gravelled footpath on one side of the new roads being formed, and extending continuously from the Greyhound Road to, and connecting with, the paved portion of the said Church Path at the Lillie Road end, and maintain the said path in good condition until the said roads and footpaths shall be taken over by the Vestry, and the Vestry directed that a copy of such report should be sent to the District Board. On the 11th March, 1886, the Vestry having received, through the District Board, a letter from the United Land Company declining to accede to the terms of the resolution passed by this Vestry on the 2nd February, 1886, the matter was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. On the 6th April, 1886, the Committee reported recommending; that, as the company had declined to agree to the proposals made by the Vestry, they (the company) be called upon to re-instate Church Path in its former condition, and on the 9th April, 1886, the Clerk to the Vestry wrote the company informing them of the Vestry's resolution. At the Works Committee on the 9th February, 1887, a letter was read from Messrs. Dalton and Jessett, on behalf of Mr. Tunley, making application for the diversion of Church Path, from Lillie Road to Mendora Road, across Delaford Street, when the subject was ordered to be viewed, and at the meeting of the View Committee held on the 16th February, 1887, it was resolved that the A estry be recommended to consent to Mr. Tunley's request, provided he pays the sum of £150 for the deviation of the footpath. On the 2nd March, 1887, the above recommendation of the Committee was referred back for further consideration, and on the 9th March, 1887, the Committee again resolved to recommend the Vestry to consent to Mr. Tunley's request provided he pays the sum of £150 towards the expenses of diverting the path. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 16th March, 1887, the report of 37 the Committee was adopted, and Messrs. Dalton and Jessett informed thereof. On the 4th May, 1887, the Works Committee resolved that the letter from Messrs. Dalton and Jessett, re the diversion of Church Path from Mendora road to Delaford Street; and the letter from Mr. C. Belton, on behalf of the United Land Company, re the deviation of Church Path, Lillie Road, be referred to the Vestry, and on consideration of the same by the Vestry at their meeting on the 11th May, 1887, it was resolved that the Vestry's previous resolution on the subject be adhered to. bishop's meadow. On the 7th July, 1886, the Metropolitan Member brought under the notice of the Vestry the subject of the conversion of the Bishop's Meadow into a recreation ground, and suggested that if the Metropolitan Board of Works would subscribe one-half of the cost the Parish should bear the other half, the payment to be spread over a term of 30 or 50 years, and the matter was referred to the Works Committee, who on the 14th July, 1886, directed the Clerk to write to the trustees of the late District Board for any information on the subject in their possession. At the meeting of the Works Committee held on the 28th July, 1886, the Clerk produced the reply of the trustees of the late District Board, in which they stated that the meadow was conveyed to the late Board by an Indenture of Conveyance from the Bishop of London and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, dated 7th August, 1884, conditionally that the land be laid out and maintained as a public recreation ground, and the Committee resolved to view same. On the 25th August, 1886, following, the Committee viewed the meadow, when the Clerk was instructed to call the attention of the Bishop of London to the dangerous condition of the moat at the southeastern corner near the entrance to the churchyard, and instructions were given to the Surveyor to put up a post and rail, and fill up the ground at a cost not exceeding £5, which were carried out. Subsequently the Medical Officer of Health was instructed by the Sanitary Committee to serve a notice on the Bishop of London to have the moat cleaned out, which notice was complied with. At the meeting of the Works Committee on the 5th January, 1887, the Clerk read a letter from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners as to the laying out of the Bishop's meadow, and the covenants from the conveyance of the Bishop of London to the Trustees of the late Fulham District Board, in which he conveyed the meadow 38 to the Board as an open space, when it was resolved that the letter be sent to the Trustees of the late District Board to carry out the conditions under the Deed of Conveyance and to apportion such liability. On the 16th February, 1887, the Works Committee again viewed the meadow, when it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that the same be levelled in accordance with the requirements of the Thames Floods Prevention Act, and on the 2nd March, 1887, the Vestry endorsed the resolution of the Committee. On the 9th of March, 1887, the Clerk read to the Works Committee a letter he had received from the Trustees of the late District Board, forwarding copy of an order from the Secretary of State vesting the Bishop's meadow in the Vestry of the parish of Fulham, when it was resolved to recommend the Vestry that the Surveyor do communicate with the Conservators of the River Thames asking them to define the frontage line, and that the Surveyor do prepare and present at the meeting of this Committee, to be held on the 6th day of April, 1887, a plan, and estimate for the construction of a River wall and fence, and laying out the ground,. which recommendation was passed by the Vestry at their meeting on the 16th March, 1887. On the 6th April, 1887, the Surveyor produced to the Works Committee plan of River wall and fence for laying out the grounds, when he was ordered to proceed with the work. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 27th April, 1887, the Law and Parliamentary Committee reported having instructed the Clerk to write to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in reply to their letter that the Committee were of opinion that the removal of the surface of the meadow was calculated to create a nuisance; that they would advise the continuing of the filling of the present ditch with slop; and, that as soon as the line of frontage has been defined by the Thames Conservators, the Vestry would undertake to keep the meadow at its proper level in conformity with the agreement with the late District Board; which report was adopted. On the 4th May, 1887, the Clerk produced to the Works Committee (1) a letter from the Conservators of the River Thames forwarding tracing showing the line of frontage at Bishop's meadow which they would be prepared to consider, and (2) a letter from the solicitors to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, stating that they would consent to no further importation of dust, slop, or other rubbish of any kind on the meadow, that they left the 39 bility with the Vestry whether any danger was likely to occur from the present ditch being left unfilled; and that they would extend, for a further space of ten days, the time for submission of the plan and section of laying out the ground. The Surveyor having produced his plan, shewing an extended line of frontage, the Clerk was directed to write the Conservators, forwarding copy of the plan prepared by the Surveyor, asking them to define the line of frontage in accordance therewith in lieu of according to their plan. The Clerk was also directed to inform the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, 1. That the land was only conveyed to the Vestry by the Secretary of State on the 3rd March, 1887. 2. That an application is now before the Thames Conservators, at the same time forwarding copy of the application ; and 3. That as soon as the line is settled, plans and sections of the laying-out, &c,, of the meadow will be prepared and forwarded to them; and on the same being reported to the Vestry at their meeting on the 11th of May, 1887, the action of the Committee was approved. At the meeting of the Works Committee on the 18th May, 1887, a further letter was read from the solicitors to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners stating that the plan showing the line of frontage should have been submitted to the Commissioners before it was forwarded to the Thames Conservators for approval, and that the Commissioners reserved to themselves the right to take objection either to the line of frontage, levels or any other details shown upon it. The consideration of the letter was ordered to stand adjourned to the next meeting, and at their next meeting on the 8th June, 1887, a letter was read from the Thames Conservators adhering to the line of frontage already proposed by them, and the Clerk was directed to send a copy of the letter, and plan referred to, to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. VESTRY HALL AND OFFICES. On the 30th March, 1886, the Vestry Hall Building Committee, appointed by the preceding Vestry to examine and report upon the designs for the Vestry Hall and offices, reported that they met on the 18th February, 1886, to consider the reference back to them of their report submitted on the 11th February, 1886, when there was a full attendance, and Mr. Curry explained the reasons of his award, and the Committee having fully discussed 40 same, and voted thereon, resolved to leave the further decision of the matter in the hands of the Vestry; and at the Vestry meeting held on the same day it was resolved that the 12 designs retained by the Building Committee be considered at a Committee of the whole Vestry, to be held on Tuesday, the 6th April, 1886, the designs to be hung up in the room each day for the inspection of the Vestrymen. At the Committee of the whole Vestry, held on the 6th April, 1886, the 12 designs were ordered to be returned to the competitors, with an instruction that as they did not comply with the requirements they may alter, modify, or re-model the plans for a final competition; that the plans might be sent in on plain white paper without any distinctive mark, colour, or motto, and that canvassing, or writing to the Vestrymen, either directly or indirectly by the competitors would exclude the plans from competition; the competitors to be informed that the Vestry would themselves adjudicate upon the plans, and that they must be returned to the Vestry by the 22nd May, 1886. On the 8th June, 1886, the Clerk reported to the Vestry that ten sets of plans had been received at the Office, and asked for instructions what was to be done with same, when, after considerable discussion, it was resolved that the same be referred to a Committee consisting of seven members to examine same, and draw up a descriptive report, setting forth the merits or demerits of each design; that the report be printed, and a copy sent to each member of the Vestry, and that the plans be hung in a convenient place for the inspection of Vestrymen six days before the meeting of the Vestry at which the decision was to be taken. At the meeting of the Vestry held on the 21st July, 1886, the Chairman stated that the committee had drawn up a report on the amended plans received, when the same was ordered to be received and printed, and a copy sent to every Vestryman, and that the plans be hung in the Vestry Room for six days from 26th July, 1886, and the report be considered at the next meeting of the Vestry. On the 6th August, the Committee's report was ordered to be considered at a Special Meeting of the Vestry, to be held on Wednesday, 22nd September, 1886, and on the latter day, after considerable discussion, the architect was appointed, and the report was referred back to the committee to confer with the architect thereon, and to report the result of such conference to a future meeting of the Vestry. On the 13th of October, 1886, the Committee reported that they had had two interviews with the architect, and presented a report which they 41 had received from him, in which he stated that he had carefully considered whether any reduction could be made in the cost of the proposed Town Hall and offices, and that he considered the work could be thoroughly well done for the sum of £20,000. A resolution was passed that the architect proceed with the working drawings and specifications, and a building committee was appointed, consisting of the Chairman of the Vestry, the parish officers, and the following seven members of the Vestry, viz.:— Messrs. Perry, Davey, Hunt, Goodacre, W. H. Smith, Humphrey, and Dr. Cooney. and, on the 27th October, 1886, Messrs. Hutchinson and Dyer were added to the Building Committee. On the last-named day a resolution was proposed directing that a letter be addressed to the Local Government Board pointing out the many complications that would necessarily arise through the Town Hall being built, partly out of the Poor Rate by the Churchwardens and Overseers, and partly by this Vestry out of their General Rate, and suggesting the advisability of the Vestry taking over (1)—The authority granted to Overseers to build a Vestry Room; (2)—The loan for £2,600 granted to the Churchwardens and Overseers to buy the land with; (3)—The land on which the Town Hall is to stand; and requesting that Board to give the necessary permission to the Churchwardens and Overseers to carry this resolution into effect, and on being put to the meeting the resolution was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. On the 8th December, 1886, the Building Committee reported that, having considered the plans and conditions for the erection of the Town Hall, they had approved same and submitted the plans for adoption by the Vestry; that they recommended that Mr. Arthur Williams, of 17, Onslow gardens, S.W., be appointed umpire to act in case of arbitration; that they had instructed the architect to direct the quantity surveyor to proceed to take out the quantities forthwith; that they recommended that an application be made to the Metropolitan Board of Works for a loan of £20,000 for the erection of the Town Hall, on the security of the General Rate; and that they had directed that fifty copies of the specification and conditions of contract be printed; which report was received and adopted. On the 13th January, 1887, the Committee met, decided that the competition should be an open one, and settled the form of advertisement to be 42 inserted in the Times, Daily Telegraph Builder, and Building News, West London Observer, West London Advertiser, and Fulham and Walham Green News, and also referred the conditions of contract to the Vestry s solicitor to settle before being" printed, which report was approved by the Vestry on the 19th of January, 1887. On the 2nd March, 1887, the Committee reported that they received a letter from the Metropolitan oard of Works enclosing form to be filled up and returned, giving particulars re proposed loan of £20,000, which information they have directed the Clerk to supply; that they had resolved that twelve months,, from the date of the Architect's letter authorising the commencement of the work, be the limit given for the building of the Town Hall, and that the penalty be £100 down, and £40 per week for every week the building remained incomplete; that they had settled the form of tender and bond, and had fixed the sum of £1,000 as the amount of security to be given jointly and severally by the sureties; and that they had fixed Wednesday, the 2nd March, 1887, at 7 p.m., as the day and hour for the reception of tenders; which report was adopted by the Vestry, and the Vestry met on the 3rd March, 1887, to decide upon the tenders, when, owing to the Committee not having had time to go thoroughly into the matter, the meeting was adjourned On 28th March, 1887, the Committee met and considered the tenders, when it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to accept the tender of Messrs. Treasure and Son (being the lowest), at the sum of £18,995 13s 4d., subject to their sureties being considered satisfactory, and their fulfilling the conditions of the contract; that the plans of the hall and offices as approved by the Metropolitan Board of Works be sealed with the Seal of the Vestry; and that the Architect do inform Messrs. Treasure that, subject to their sureties proving satisfactory, they must attend at the Vestry offices on Wednesday, the 13th of April, next, to sign contract, and commence work, which recommendations were adopted by the Vestry at their meeting on the 2nd April, 1887. On the 6th April, 1887, Mr. Struthers attended before the Committee, on behalf of Mr. Treasure (who was prevented attending by a family bereavement), and having consulted with them re the proposed sureties, asked to be permitted to inspect Mr. Treasure's bills of quantities, which permission was granted, and the Architect and Solicitor were instructed to have the contract ready for signature by the 13th April, 1887; Mr. Struthers having informed the Committee that he 43 had discovered a serious error in the quantities, which would make a difference of about £2,000 on the tender, and stated he would return to Shrewsbury at once, and inform Mr. Treasure of the occurrence. The Committee adjourned the meeting until the 13th April, 1887, and on that day a letter and telegram were read from Mr. Treasure, asking to be allowed to withdraw his tender, and regretting the cause of his having to do so; and the Clerk reported that he had sent to Mr. Wall and Mr. Scrivener, asking if they would stand by their tenders, but up to the time of the meeting Mr. Scrivener had not replied, and that Mr. Wall felt a little delicacy in attending before the Committee without an official invitation. The Committee having fully discussed the matter, it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to sanction the withdrawal of Messrs. Treasure and Son's tender, and that the tender of Mr. Charles Wall at £19,938, being the next lowest tender, be accepted, which recommendation was adopted at the Vestry meeting on the same day. On the 19th April, 1887, the Building Committee resolved to recommend the Vestry that a letter be written to the Local Government Board, asking them to allow a transfer of the land, with mortgage, from Churchwardens and Overseers to the Vestry, and that the Vestry do repay the Poor Rate the amount paid to them; also that a letter be written to the Metropolitan Board of Works pointing out the use to which the large rooms would be put to; and that the Finance Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works be requested to receive a deputation, consisting of the Chairman of the Vestry, the Chairman of the Committee (Mr. Harris), and Messrs. Hutchinson, Hamer, Goodacre, Davey, and the Clerk, on Tuesday, the 3rd May, 1887, re the loan of £20,000; all of which recommendations were adopted by the Vestry on the 27th April, 1887. At the meeting of the Committee held on the 6th May, 1887, the deputation reported the result of their interview with the Finance Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works, when it was resolved to recommend the Vestry to withdraw the application for the loan and the plans now before that Board, which recommendation was adopted on the 11th May, and the application for loan, and plans, were withdrawn accordingly. free library. On the 7th July, 1886, the Clerk—on behalf of the Overseers— produced a requisition which they had received requesting them t 44 call a public meeting of this parish for the purpose of determining whether or not the Public Libraries Act of 1855, and the Acts amending the same, should be adopted by the parish of Fulham, and the same was referred to the Law and Parliamentary Committee. At the meeting of that committee held on the 12th day of July, 1886, the Clerk having stated that Mr. Cunynghame had made a request to have the memorial returned, it was resolved that, on a written request by Mr. Cunynghame, the memorial will be returned to him, which was subsequently done. Then on the 24th November, 1886, it was resolved, on the motion of Dr. Cooney, seconded by Mr. Mclllroy, to commemorate the approaching J ubilee of the reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen by some permanent work worthy of the parish; the Vestry of Fulham, as the public representatives of the parish of Fulham, under sec. 1, of 84 and 35 Vic., c. 71, which empowers such Vestry to adopt and carry into execution the "Public Libraries Act, 1885," do ascertain the opinions of the majority of the ratepayers by the issue of a voting paper to each ratepayer as to the adoption of such Act, i.e. whether the parish of Fulham should have a free library or not, for the benefit of all classes, such voting papers to be issued agreeably to the "Public Libraries Amendment Act, 1877," and that the voting papers be delivered on Friday, the 10th December, 1886, and collected on Monday, the 13th December, 1886. The Clerk then prepared and issued voting papers to all persons qualified to vote, and on the 8th December, 1886, the Vestry appointed Messrs. Dyer, Hutchinson, Spraggs, and Elkins as tellers for the counting of the voting papers, and on the 22nd December, 1886, the Clerk produced the following report, which was received, and the thanks of the Vestry were tendered to him for the efficient manner in which he conducted the voting. [COPY.] I beg to report that, in accordance with the instructions given at the Vestry meeting on the 24th November last, I divided the parish into 28 districts, and on Friday, the 10th instant, I issued 10,263 ballot papers; of these 312 were brought back on the same day by the police on account of empty houses, persons gone, &c. The papers were collected on Monday, the 13th inst., and were counted on the following day with this result: 45 In favour of a free library 3,788 Against 1,324 Rejected and spoilt papers on account of informality 2,641 Not received back 1,998 9,751 I beg to submit that the next step will be to elect the Library Commissioners, which must not be less than 3 nor more than 9, see 18 and 19 Vic., c. 70, sec. 8. I have not yet been able to ascertain the total amount of expenses connected with the ballot, but I think that they will not exceed £60. I cannot close my report without tendering my thanks to Mr. Marsh, the Clerk to the Guardians, for having lent me his official poll books of the last election of Guardians and the ballot boxes; to Mr. Denselow, the Assistant Clerk to the Vestry, for his assistance in the matter; and to the police authorities for the excellent manner in which they delivered and collected the ballot papers.

From 1856, the first year of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, to 25th March, 1886, the parish of Fulham formed part of the Fulham District, and was included in "Schedule B" of that Act, for administrative and executive purposes, but in 1885 an act entitled the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1885 (48 & 49 Vic., cap. 33), was passed, to take effect from 25th March, 1886, dissolving the District Board and incorporating the Vestry of Fulham in Part II. of Schedule "A" of the Act of 1855. During the year 1886-7 the property, claims, &c., of the late Board were divided between the parishes in the ratio of 41.13 per cent, to Fulham and 58.87 per cent. to Hammersmith. The principal claims transferred are the mortgages on the rates, of which loans amounting to £27,032 are chargeable on the general rate, and repayable at various dates from 1 to 46 years, with a commencing annual charge for principal and interest of £4,438 4s. 3d. (about 3½d. in £ on assessment for 1886). This sum is about £42 less for the first year than would have been the case if the loans could have been more easily adjusted. The loans chargeable on the Sewers Rate amount to £16,982 12s., repayable at various periods in 17 years, with a .commencing annual charge of £1,851 2s. 5d. (equal to a l½d. in £ rate), being less by nearly £90 than its fair proportion of the late district sewer charges, and brought about by the loans taken over by this parish having a slightly longer duration than would have been the case if an equitable adjustment could have been effected; therefore the loans on the Sewer Rate exceed its share of the total by £191 6s. 6d., while the General Rate is £168 18s. 3d. short of its proportion, consequently a transfer was made to the Sewers Rate of that amount, thereby reducing its excess to £22 8s. 3d., which sum the Hammersmith Vestry have paid this Vestry under order dated 23rd July, 1886, of the Secretary of State, Home Department. The total amount due on mortgages as per the register at 25th March, 1886, was £44,014 12s. During the past year £4,596 10s. 8d. principal has been repaid, and as no new loans have been effected, the amount of indebtedness of the Vestry on loans has been reduced to £39,418 1s. 4d., or the small amount of 11£ per cent, of the present ratable value. AMOUNT TO BE RECEIVED FOR PROPERTY. With regard to the property, &c., of the late Board, 66 ing to £32,600, this Vestry took but a small part of it, viz.:— £4,390 12s. 0d. principally on account of the real property being situated in the parish of Hammersmith, and therefore required by the Vestry of that parish, and by so doing making them debtors to this Vestry, on a final adjustment, to the amountof £7,038 0s. Id., which sum the Home Secretary ordered them, on the 21st March 1887, to pay this Vestry within three months from 25th March, 1887, with interest at 3½ per cent. per annum; this amount, together with that to be paid by the Trustees of the late Board, viz., £774 15s., will have to be spent in the purchase of Vestry hall, stables, wharf, &c., or taken in reduction of the outstanding mortgages. Particulars of the amounts due by Hammersmith and the Trustees will be found on page No. 80. PROPERTIES, &c.

The Central Boards issuing precepts on the Vestry, are the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London, the precept for the year 1886-7, of the former, amounts to £9,626 1s. 4d., equal to a rate of 6.92 in £, this is an increase of £1,445 4s. 4d. on that of the previous year, and but for the assessment having increased to the extent of something like £44,000, being equal to an increase of £184 7s. 3d. on each 1d. in the £ on rates, would have necessitated a consolidated rate of 8¼d in the £, the actual result being a rate of nearly ⅜ths of 1d. in the £ less than 1885-6.

S.W. May 16th, 1887. To the Chairman and Members of the Finance Committee. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I have abstracted the cost of repairs to carts, vans, and trap, from 26th March, 1886, to 25th March, 1887, and find that the sum of £218 8s. 2d. has been paid to Messrs. Ashford, Blanch, and Smith, Parfrey & Hitchings, for repairs to carts and wheels. That about £85 has been expended in wages to wheelwright and painter, and for colours, etc., making a total of about £305 for sixty carts, and vans, and one trap, or about £5 each per annum for maintenance. Your obedient Servant, R. HERMANN MEYER, Accountant. NEW STREETS. With reference to the New Streets Accounts, the net amount due by contributors on the old roads transferred to this Vestry by the late District Board of Works is £755 12s. 11d., and on those streets, 14 in number, taken to by the Vestry during the past year is £6,429 17s. 5d., making the total amount due on new streets to be £7,185 10s. 4d. USE OF WHARF, MORTUARY, &C. The Vestry not having a Wharf, Mortuary, Disinfecting Chamber, or Ambulance of their own, had to use those of the Hammersmith Vestry, at a cost of £183 16s. 3d. for the year. 72 ACCOUNTS.

OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY. together with LIST OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STREETS, IMPROVEMENTS, CONTRACTS, INVENTORY OF PLANT, Etc. JAMES P. NORRINGTON, Surveyor to the Vestry. VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR, For the Year 1886-7. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, In accordance with the instructions contained in the bye-laws, I beg to submit to you the following report of the various works and subjects connected with my department for the year commencing on the 25th of March, 1886, and ending with the 30th of April, 1887 (see section 42, page 31, of Bye-laws). The year is of special interest to the Vestry of Fulham, because it was the first year of its existence as a separate vestry. My appointment as surveyor to the Vestry took place on the 11th day of March, 1886, and I commenced my duties on the 25th of the same month. This appointment was confirmed at the meeting of the Vestry held on the 26th of March. Mr. W. P. Jones, as Superintendent of Roads, and Mr. F. W. J. Palmer, as Assistant Surveyor, were also appointed at the same time. area of the parish. The area of the parish of Fulham comprises (according to the figures of the ordnance survey) 1700.324 acres. In addition to the above, there are 99.614 acres tidal water, and 56*561 acres foreshore. length of streets.

Probably owing to the prospect of the separation of the parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith, the roads in this district do not appear to have received, for some time previous to the separation, the amount of material necessary for their proper maintenance, and they were generally in a very much worn and uneven condition. Many of them were also very flat, so that the rainfall had not a proper chance of running off the surface. I therefore gave these roads my first attention, and during the past twelve months every public road in this district on which there is a through traffic has received a coating of metalling, and had the crown raised. Where granite has been used it has in most cases been rolled smooth and to a good shape with the steam roller immediately after being laid. The following statement will shew where granite has been used, and the amount. STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE OF NEW GRANITE, &c., FROM 25TH MARCH, 1886, TO 25TH MARCH, 1887. Length in Yds. Old Mac. Yds.

Cases also arise in which it is cheaper to substitute a superior class of paving for roadways even, although the first cost of such improved paving is much greater. This is due to the excessive cost of maintenance of granite roads under very heavy traffic, owing to the necessity of constantly renewing the surface and the immense quantity of slop that has to be carted away. On the 14th of March, 1887, a report was circulated amongst the members of the Vestry, in which I calculated that it would save £60 a year to pave the Lillie-road with wood. Since that date the traffic has enormously increased, so that the above amount does not give an adequate idea of the saving that could be effected by the change. These remarks will also apply to the North-end-road. Some subsidences have occurred in streets during the year, chiefly through the breakage of drains. One occurred in Harwoodroad in June last. The sanding of the streets in slippery weather has received great attention, and the purchase of a sanding machine (price £50) has materially assisted this work. One new sweeping machine was purchased in December last. broken granite. The granite supplied to this Vestry for making and repairing the roadways is specified to be Guernsey granite and not to exceed 2½in. in its largest dimension. The first two barge loads sent were rejected for not conforming to this requirement, since then the material sent has been satisfactory in every respect. flints and ballast. The flints used for repairing the less important thoroughfares are obtained from Messrs. Wills & Packman, and have been supplied in a satisfactory condition. 980 yards have been used. The ballast has been obtained from within the parish. 98 wood pavement. The wood pavement at Walham Green has received a good deal of attention during the year, and is in every respect so satisfactory a pavement as to be an inducement to increase the area of wood paving in this parish. side walks. The pavements of the side walks in this parish are almost entirely of York stone. In a report on the subject of footpavements laid before the Paving Sub Committee, I stated that the stones used in this and the adjoining parishes are smaller and more irregular in size than I have previously been accustomed to see. In order to obviate these defects I specified a larger size, and a better quality stone, and the new paving laid down from time to time by the contractors has been of a much improved character. The specified size of the stones is still in my opinion not large enough. I should be glad if the Vestry would give me an opportunity of testing side by side with York stones some of the new paving materials that are in the market. I submit below a tabulated statement of the different pavements with the approximate prices and durability of each. Description of Paving. Rate per yd.. super. Life of Pavement. s. d.

There are 100 streets not yet taken to in the Fulham District, and the enormous quantity of vacant land in the Parish suitable for building on, is rapidly being filled up with streets. The present state of these streets is exceedingly discreditable and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants. This evil can only be prevented by Parliament enacting that houses shall not be built in a street until it is completed to the satisfaction of and taken over by the local authorities. The Vestrv have, however, to deal with what exists, and in face of the great pressure of other work in the department, and the large quantity of undeveloped land in the district, the only practical way of dealing with these streets is to appoint at least two draughtsmen, who shall do nothing but new streets work, until the enormous number of incomplete and insanitary streets is reduced. In making this suggestion, the Vestry must remember that it need not cost anything to the ratepayers, as the Yestry recover the expenses of making plans, &c., of new streets as a part of the cost of making up the streets. 101 LIST OF PUBLIC STREETS.

The length of main sewers in the parish, i.e., sewers belonging to the Metropolitan Board, is 3½ miles. The lengths of sewers belonging to the Vestry are 41/4 miles of brick, and 25 miles of pipe sewers. I reproduce here extracts from a report on this subject, which has been submitted to the members of the Vestry. OWNERSHIP OF SEWERS. The chief of the main sewers in Fulham belong to the Metropolitan Board, others have been constructed by private owners and handed over to the Vestry. Many of these latter are in roads not yet handed over to the parish. SITUATION OF FULHAM. The parish of Fulham is unfortunately not at all favourably situated in reference to its drainage. As the level of the parish is very close to the level of the Thames, the flow of sewage in sewers is slow, and on the slightest fall of rain there is a tendency for the sewage from the higher districts of London to create a back flow into our sewers. At times of very heavy rain the sewers become charged with sewage, and remain so for many hours, until such time as the engines at the Yictoria Pumping Station, by the Chelsea Bridge, raise it into the High Level Sewer. This process has been known to occupy ten hours. FLOODING OF SEWERS. During one heavy thunderstorm which occurred last year the water rose quite 10-ft. in the North End and Walham Green sewer, and flooded many basements and low lying parts. The depth of water in the basement of houses in the Broadway was 6 inches. When such a flooding occurs it is evident that at every stroke of the pumps, at the pumping station above referred to, the subsidence of the sewage will be very gradual, and this must lead to large deposits of solid matter in the sewers. Fall of Sewers. The other drawbacks to the proper dealing with this question in Fulham are the want of proper fall in many of the sewers, and the number of dead ends without any provision for ventilation. 104 Dead Ends. These dead ends ought to have manholes and ventilating shafts, and they should also be connected with the nearest adjacent sewer, by a pipe at least 9-in. in diameter, in order to assist the ventilation and the circulation of air in the sewers. Manholes. It is also not generally known that there are in the parish nearly 200 manholes without proper manhole covers or ventilators, but which are covered with a flat iron top, 18-in. below the surface of road, and the road continued over them. Whenever these sewers are flushed, it is necessary to excavate the road in order to get at the manholes. There are also manholes and ventilators provided at very irregular distances apart, and many of the sewers are almost entirely without them. The superficial area of the openings of the existing ventilators through which the escaping air passes is 58-ins. Flushing. There are no special flushing tanks in Fulham. The flushing is done by filling the manholes from the nearest water supply, and letting the whole volume of water escape suddenly into the sewer Grulleys. All gulleys are supplied with catch-pits, so that solid matters from the roadways are prevented passing through them into the sewers. These catch-pits are cleared out periodically. Ventilators. The ventilators in the roadways (except in the case of a few recently constructed), have not any arrangement for preventing the dirt entering the sewers. CLEANSING AND VENTILATION. The evils that arise from an imperfect system of sanitation are too well known for it to be necessary to recapitulate them here. The remedies are briefly stated—constant cleansing and ventilation. Flushing. The cleansing of sewers is best obtained by means of Flushing. In the winter this is only done in special instances, but in the summer two gangs, that is six men, are constantly at the work. The number of manholes already referred to as being buried beneath the surface of the roads are a great drawback, and an unnecessary cause of increasing the expense of this operation. 105 The system of flushing can also be assisted by flushing privatecourts, by obtaining periodical flushings at stated times by private owners, and by constructing a number of flushing tanks to empty themselves automatically and periodically. I do not recommend the last suggestion on account of the expense, except as a means of dealing with any specially bad case that may arise. Ventilation.—With respect to ventilation, it is well known that every untrapped opening to a sewer creates a current of air in the sewer, and either acts as a ventilator or assists ventilation. Under these circumstances the greater the number of openings that are obtained at different levels the more effectual will be the ventilation. The policy to be adopted is, therefore, to multiply these openings, especially those which can be obtained in convenient positions at a height from the ground, either by special pipes or shafts or by untrapped rain-water-pipes. VENTILATING SHAFTS. There are at present only two small ventilating shafts in Fulham carried to any height. It is to be regretted that private owners of property do not assist the Yestry more in this matter, as without the co-operation of owners of adjoining property it is not possible to erect air shafts. Even those who complain of a nuisance created by a street ventilator will frequently not assist the Yestry by allowing air shafts to be erected on or near their property. REST LAMPS AS VENTILATORS. One means of obtaining ventilating shafts that has been neglected is by choosing a suitable pattern rest lamp, and making it act as a ventilator. Charcoal.—The use of charcoal as a deoderizer has been throroughly tried for ten years in Croydon, and finally abandoned. The charcoal acts only while it is dry, and as it also absorbs moisture it soon becomes useless. It has been tried and abandoned by the Fulham Board of Works. It is not practicable to adopt it systematically. It may, however, be used in solitary instances to mitigate special evils, and where particular attention to the supply of dry charcoal can be given. Cowls, etc.—There are also many schemes, proposals and patents for assisting the ventilation of sewers by means of cowls and fans, etc. Cowls are all so dependent on air shafts that the Yestry might first consider the difficulty of providing the shafts 106 before considering the details of these schemes. The extent of the action of cowls is almost entirely dependent on the force of the existing wind, so that at the times when the atmosphere is heavy and unusually still, and when sewers generally make their existence known, the action of cowls is not of much benefit. RECOMMENDATIONS. In conclusion, I beg to recommend as the readiest and most practicable means of putting the sewers within the parish in a more satisfactory condition : 1. Fall of Sewers-—That particular attention be paid to the fall of sewers. 2. Manholes and Ventilation of Dead Ends.—That manholes and ventilators be provided at all dead ends, and that they be connected with the nearest adjoining sewer by a 9-in. pipe. 3. Steam and Obnoxious Matters.—That steam should not be allowed to be discharged into the sewers, or any obnoxious matter from factories, unless it has previously been specially treated and deodorized. 4. Manholes.—That a 2-feet square manhole cover, with a ventilating area of 63 square inches, be placed on all the manholes which are now covered with an iron plate. 5. Surface. Ventilators 60 yards apart—That surface ventilators be fixed to all old sewers at least 60 yards apart. 6. Rest Lamps as Ventilators.—That all rest lamps be used as ventilating shafts. 7. Special Shafts.—That special ventilating pipes or shafts be obtained wherever practicable. 8. Rain Water Pipes.—That rain water pipes where situated in a good position, and when the joints are thoroughly secured, be also allowed to act as ventilating shafts. 9. Flushing.—That the present system of flushing be continued ; that the owners of courts and other properties be encouraged to have their private drains flushed, and that the Vestry undertake to do the work on payment of a small fee. 10. Catchpits to Ventilators.—That all ventilators be provided with an arrangement to prevent dirt passing through them into the sewers. Flushing Tarnks, etc—I further recommend that flushing tanks, shafts with fires in them, or connected with factory shafts, shafts with cowls on top, and special deodorizers can be used with great benefit in special cases, and that such special cases be dealt with individually as they arise. 107 SIZE AND SHAPE OF SEWERS. The best shape for the section of a sewer is egg-shaped ; all sewers built of brickwork are so formed. The smaller sizes, being formed with pipes, are circular. Sewers should not be larger than absolutely necessary, as the bottom or sides of a small sewer are more thoroughly scoured and cleansed when they are flushed, or in times of rain. This cleansing is materially assisted by a good fall. Sewers should also, if practicable, be laid in straight lines, from manhole to manhole, so that they can be readily seen through or inspected. During the past year new sewers have been laid in the undermentioned streets. Sewers Laid during year ending 30th April, 1887. Road or Street, Description. Length in feet. Av. depth in ft.

If the connection is in a private road, the connection only is made by the Vestry's workmen. A deposit to cover the cost of the work is in all instances required, any surplus money being returned after the work is finished; in some instances a further charge has had to be made. To cover the costs of the 181 connections set forth, above 54 different sums amounting to a total of £420 4s. 7d. have been passed over to the accountant through this department. new buildings. During the year plans were submitted for the drainage of the following new buildings:— 286 Houses. 20 Shops and business premises. 4 Chapels. 1 School (Board.) 8 Miscellaneous. Alterations. 319 Total. New Bye-Laws for regulating the drainage of houses have been approved and adopted by the Vestry. The proper drainage of houses is of such great importance that in this parish, as in many towns, it should be the business of a special inspector to see every pipe laid. street cleansing. The cleansing of the streets has received its proper attention My experience is that this parish is singularly free from complaints of want of attention to this matter. The main thoroughfares are cleansed three times a week, and the other streets at least once a week. There are 36 sweepers in the employ of the Vestry, divided into three gangs, who have each a district allotted them. The cost of the cartage, disposal of the slop and sweepings, is an item of great importance, and one that will increase yearly as the difficulty of disposing of it increases. Since the Ecclesiastical Commissioners prevented the Vestry carting on to the Bishop's Meadow a charge per load has had to be paid for leave to shoot at various places. 112 It would materially assist and lessen the cost of cleansing the streets if a proper supply of sweeping and scraping machines were provided, there should be at least four of each, whereas the Yestry only possess two sweeping machines and no scrapers. The scraping machines would also be very useful in time of snow. They cost £21 each. Re Dusting. On the 29th of June I made a report to the Cartage Committee on this question, showing that the then rate of clearing was an average of 255 loads a week, that 239 loads cleared 1,806 houses, or at 9,658 inhabited houses in the parish, it would take over 31 days to clear the parish. I further marked out the parish into 12 districts, and the Yestry having put on two more carts, a great improvement in the dusting took place, the district being frequently been cleared within the fortnight. According to the report of the Board of Works during 1885-6, 11,364 loads of dust were removed, by 3,290 horses one day each, or over 3½ loads per horse per day. During 1886-7, 3,076 horses one day each removed 11,031 loads of dust, or an average of 3 3-5ths loads per horse per day. The cost of horses for dusting at 10s. a day per horse will equal £1,538, and the cost of carting each load will equal 2s. 9½d. The wages paid to the men for collecting have been Is. 6d. a load. The carts of the Yestry have for some long time past been tipping their dust on the Bishop's Meadow. In March last the Ecclesiastical Commissioners complained that the view from the Bishops Garden was being destroyed, and threatened the Yestry with an injunction to restrain them from shooting more dust on the meadows. The Vestry have therefore entered into an arrangement to pay £50 per quarter for a tip on the Ranelagh estate. The Bishop s Meadow has been raised in parts as much as 4'0 in. above the original highest part, and 2*0. in higher than the height required by Thames River Prevention of Floods Act. One of the first things that struck me in Fulham was what I considered the loss arising from the method of dealing with the dust. I had always been under the impression that dust was worth a certain amount of sorting, inasmuch as ashes, breeze, old iron, 113 &c., had a marketable value. The Vestry will see that my impression was not incorrect when I say that Paddington Vestry, in 1886, sold the siftings of their dust for £1,483 18s. The dealing with the dust of London is a very difficult question, and will occupy the attention of the different vestries considerably during the next year. A combination of the sorting process for the valuable products and a destructor for the waste unsanitary portion will probably be found the best and cheapest method of dealing with the problem. Complaints Re Dusting. The number of dust complaints per month during the year were as follows :— 1886 1886 From 26th March to 25th April 70 April „ May 209 „ May „ June 250 „ June „ July 228 July „ August 109 „ August „ Sept. 62 „ Sept. „ Oct. 5fi „ Oct. „ Nov. 92 „ Nov. „ Dec. 69 1887 „ Dec. ,. Jan. 150 1887 „ Jan. „ Feb. 224 „ Feb. „ March 158 Total 1,677 While many of these complaints are without just reason, and frequently arise through people refusing admission to the dustmen on the first occasion when they call, the statement is not satisfactory, and I recommend that the number of complaints be printed on the agenda of each meeting of the Cartage Committee. For some reason the control of the dust has been recently removed from the Cartage to the Sanitary Committee. This appears to be shifting the responsibility from the Surveyor's department to that of the Medical officer's, and I have lost control over the working of the department, although I al- 114 ways thought it was one of the moat important of my duties. I think this change arises through the bye laws that were adopted by the Vestry. TRADE REFUSE. The removal of trade refuse ought to be fairly paid for by the tradesman, and a not inconsiderable sum should be received in the course of the year for this part of the work. The charge is 2s. 6d. a load and Is. for less than half a load. I cannot give the amount received for this work, as the sums are paid direct by Mr. Witney to the accountant. Three falls of snow occurred during the year, and were promptly attended to. At the time of the first fall, on the 26th of December, I was at Exeter, and although my last instructions were that I was immediately to be telegraphed for if snow fell, and I specially wrote to Mr. Foakes to that effect; owing to the most extraordinary breakages of the telegraph wires all over England, I did not receive any message. Snow fell at the same time at Exeter, but thawed rapidly, and my impression was that the storm was a local one. I did not know to the contrary until the receipt of the London papers on the Tuesday, when I at once returned. Mr. Jones, the superintendent of roads has had great experience in the removal of snow, and he had received full instructions to act in my absence. The * snow was therefore cleared in the Fulham district as soon as anywhere in London. The plan adopted is to place the snow in heaps at the sides of the roads and to keep the channels clear. As many extra men as are deemed requisite are employed at the rate of 4d. per hour, the main thoroughfares receiving the first attention. Although some of the snow was carted away from the principal thoroughfares, it would not do to cart all slit away, as the expense would be so heavy as to increase the rates. Many methods of getting rid of it after collection have been submitted to me, but so far as I can learn the least expensive is that of thawing the snow with steam jets. Very good snow ploughs are now made, and road scrapers also act very well in clearing the roads.

On page 15 of the report an estimate is made that the Vestry could effect an annual saving over the cost of lighting. I have reason to know that it would take at least 15 men to light the parish within the required time instead of ten as estimated, so that no saving on this item could be effected. There are four lamps in the Margravine Gardens in Hammersmith parish paid for by this Vestry, and nine lamps in the Hammersmith Road in Fulham parish paid for by the Hammersmith Vestry. The cost of these last is recouped by the Fulham Vestry to the Hammersmith Vestry in the amount paid for the maintenance of the Hammersmith Road. I have caused a book to be prepared, giving the number and exact position of every lamp within the parish. HORSES. The Vestry have now 21 horses and one nag. The nag has an unpleasant habit of kicking. I consider she is a dangerous animal to drive, and that a fresh horse should be provided. During the year one horse which this Vestry bought from Hammersmith for £10 was sold for £11. STABLES. From the time of the separation of the parishes to the 9th of February, 1887, 11 horses were stabled at Hammersmith, at a cost of £1 each per week, and the remainder in the stables of the Vestry at Trafalgar-house; since the 9th February, 1887, temporary stables have been hired at the Saw Mills, Munster Road. On the 4th of December, 1886, I reported on nine different sites proposed for stables, and the Vestry ultimately decided on buying from the District Railway a very suitable piece of land in Munster Lane, area, 3,000 square yards, price £1,500. In addition to this site it is proposed to rent from the company 12 arches adjoining, at a rent of £100 a year. REFUGES. Refuges for foot-passengers at the crossings of roads have been erected in several places (see list of Improvements) and lamps placed on each (see Lamps). 124 urinals. 1 4-stall urinal at corner of Effie Road and Fulhcim Road. 1 '' '' opposite Walham Green Church. 1 '' '' Gibbs Green. 1 '' '' Walham Green, opposite Vestry offices. bishop's meadow. The piece of land situate between the Bishop's Palace and the River Thames was given to the Fulham District by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on condition that it was used as a park or recreation ground.

The Vestry have been using the Hammersmith Wharf since the separation at a rental of £137 15s. 6d. It is, however, well known that the Hammersmith Vestry want the whole of it for their own purposes, and this Vestry ought not to lose any time in getting about four or five acres by the riverside. The Vestry cannot buy too large a wharf, on account of the space that will be required in the future for dealing with the dust and slop, besides the regular requirements of the Vestry, and other demands for space at the riverside that are certain to arise. An application has been made to the Metropolitan Board for the site of the old Toll House, Putney Bridge. The area of this site is 940 square yards. 126 CHANNELLING OF ROADS. A number of roads in this parish require channelling. This work was being carried out by the Fulham District Board of Works in sections, the cost being provided for by borrowing money under the loan schedule. In the latter part of 1885 the work was, however, discontined, probably on account of the approaching separation of the parishes. The roads that are not channelled are contained in the following list. Many of them do not immediately require it, and I have placed the names in the order in which I think they require attention. The cost of doing the channelling will be almost precisely 2s. a foot run. it will, however, be added to in many parts by the cost of varying and altering the levels of the roads, and new gullies and connections of the same with drains will have to be provided. 127 Feet—run Name of Road At 2s. per foot £ s. d. 50 North End Road 5 0 0 330 Lillie Road 33 0 0 1,000 Harwood Terrace 100 0 0 600 Hillbrooke Terrace 60 0 0 1,200 Estcourt Road 120 0 0 6,000 Greyhound Road 600 0 0 400 Orchard Street, North End 40 0 0 800 Portland Street 80 0 0 600 Devonshire Street 60 0 0 800 Vernon Street 80 0 0 600 Munden Street 60 0 0 800 Fane Street 80 0 0 1,200 William Street 120 0 0 2,400 Farm Lane 240 0 0 5,700 Crown Road 570 0 0 9,000 Kings Road to Pottery 900 0 0 8,200 Wandsworth Bridge Road 820 0 0 2,400 Parsons Green Lane 240 0 0 6,200 Fulham Palace Road, from Hammersmith to Crown Road 620 0 0 9.800 Fulham Palac6 Road, from Crown Road to High Street 980 0 0 2,200 Normand Road 220 0 0 1,800 Rectory Road 180 0 0 600 St. Thomas' Road 60 0 0 4,400 Margravine Road 440 0 0 5,400 Broomhouse Lane 540 0 0 3,000 Bagley's Lane 300 0 0 1,800 Burlington Road 180 0 0 3,360 Dawes Lane to Rylston Road 336 0 0 4,226 Bishops Road 422 12 0 6,872 Munster Lane 687 4 0 6,000 Peterborough Lane 600 0 0 1,250 Colehill Lane 125 0 0 1,400 Daisy Lane 140 0 0 2,400 Fulham Road 240 0 0 3,360 Dawes Road, from Sherbrooke Road to Munster Road 336 0 0 2,060 Star Lane 206 0 0 586 Factory Lane 58 12 0 1,400 Hurlingham Lane 140 0 0 2,620 Rylston Road 262 0 0 480 Church Row 48 0 0 £11,32 9 8 0 128 HOARDING LICENSES. Special attention has been paid to hoardings. One or two builders have been negligent in reference to the handrail and platform that is required, and have either failed to promptly erect it or have let it get into disrepair.

PLAN OF THE DISTRICT. The Vestry ought to possess a complete and corrected plan of the district, shewing all new streets, buildings, sewers, drains, &c. At present the best plans are the ordnance sheets, 20 years old, and it would take at least six months' uninterrupted work to correct these sheets and make fair copies. Once done, it would not be a difficult matter to keep it correct. The work is of such importance that a special draughtsman ought to be engaged and kept at the work until completed. The plan of the parish of Chelsea has, I believe, just been completed in this manner. 129 OVERHEAD TELEGRAPH WIRES. The danger and inconvenience caused by the breakage of wires during the snowstorms called prominent attention to this subject, and I reported to the Vestry and to the Metropolitan Board that 53 single wires in 23 different localities were broken in this district. I hope the Vestry will keep this subject in mind, and that every effort will be used to compel these wires to be as far as practicable laid under ground, and in a manner satisfactory to the local authority. A hollow cast-iron kerb, specially designed for this purpose, has been patented, and a trial length put down in a large midland town. HAMMERSMITH ROAD. A portion of this road being half in Falham and half in Hammersmith, the Metropolitan Board decided that it should be kept in repair by the Hammersmith Vestry, and the sum of £525 5s. 6d. per annum paid by this Vestry to Hammersmith for maintenance. My estimate of the cost was £445 5s 8d., that of Mr. Bean's, the surveyor of Hammersmith, was £609 5s. 5d. NEW BRIDGE FROM FULHAM TO PUTNEY. This bridge was formally opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on the 29th day of May, 1886. The Vestry of Fulham will have to maintain the half of the road and footways on and after the 1st day of December, 1887. CHURCH STREET IMPROVEMENT. Plans have been prepared showing this street widened to 45ft., in order to improve this approach to Putney Bridge, and application made to the Metropolitan Board to contribute one half the cost of this required improvement. CROMWELL ROAD BRIDGE. I prepared from time to time a number of reports, estimates and plans in reference to this suggested improvement. The Vestry have had the complete particulars of the scheme submitted to them in the report of the Cromwell Road Bridge Sub-Committee of the Works Commttiee. 130 The Vestry was asked to contribute £10,000 towards the cost, which amount can be borrowed at 3£ per cent., or £350 per annum. The building of the bridge would cause the present 200 vacant houses to be let at a rental of £13,194. The rates from these alone would produce, at 3s. 6d. on the £1, about £2,253, or a profit of about £1,900 per annum on a capital outlay of £10,000. The rental of the present occupied property (£54,500 per annum), would soon increase about 10 per cent., or £5,450 a year, producing increased rates to the extent of £931 a year. A further profit to the Vestry would also arise from the letting of the 570 vacant building plots, which would ultimately produce a rental of about £40,000, or an additional profit to the rates of over £6,830 a year. I have never before come across an improvement scheme where the immediate actual money profit was so directly assessable and so large. Irrespective of questions of profit, I may say here that the traffic over the Addison Road Bridge and the Lillie Road has, during the last 12 months, increased as to become congested, and an additional bridge will, in a few years, become a necessity, cost what it may. In the figures given above, I have not gone into the question of the repayment of the loan of the £10,000, for as the benefits to the parish would be of a permanent character, I am considering the capital outlay as permanent. This calculation is exclusive of the Poor Rate, which amounts to 2s. 6d. in the £. RAILWAY AND TRAMWAY SCHEMES. Plans were deposited for a scheme to run a railway from Latimer Road to Acton. The scheme was not, however, proceeded with, so that I was not under the necessity of enquiring into and reporting upon the details of it. 131 The proposal, however, to connect the Avonmore Road with the Acton and Hammersmith Tramways was only withdrawn at the last moment, and I reported fully on the matter to the Vestry, besides having to further report to and assist the solicitor to the Vestry in drafting the petition and getting evidence, so as to defeat the proposal. The most objectionable parts of the scheme were the proposal to convert the Avonmore Road into a tramway terminus, and the danger to the increasing traffic in the Hammersmith Road, through the trams having to turn the corner, just at the foot of the declivity from the bridge. I cannot see why trams or omnibuses should be allowed to occupy the road, converting it into a sort of railway terminus, when it would be easy for the companies to purchase a piece of land at the side for the cars, &c., to stand, and where they might also provide a ticket office and waiting room. I append here for the purpose of comparison in the future the return of the number of vehicles on the Hammersmith Road and Avonmore Road on the 2nd of February, 1887.

I remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES P. NORRINGTON, Surveyor to the Vestry. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. SANITARY DEPARTMENT. FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Being for the Year 1886—7. THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF FULHAM. SANITARY DEPARTMENT. Vestry Offices, Walham Green, S.W. May, 1887. Gentlemen,—In presenting this my First Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Fulham, I have to make a few preliminary remarks. First. The vital statistics have been compiled for the registration year ended 31st December, 1886, and the sanitary statistics for the parochial year ended 25th March, 1887. Second. The estimated population is calculated on the increased number of inhabited houses, viz.:—In 1881 there were 5,812 inhabited houses and 42,900 inhabitants in the parish, and on March 25th, 1886, 9,658 inhabited houses. Assuming the population to have increased in the same proportion as the inhabited, houses, the present population would be in round numbers, 70,000 Third. With regard to the sanitary statistics which deal with the parochial year, the parish is considered in two separate divisions, a northern and a southern, these divisions coinciding as nearly as possible with the divisions allotted to the District Medical Officers under the Poor Law Guardians, Inspector Croucher having the northern and Inspector Marsh the southern district. This division was approved of by your Sanitary Committee on my entering into office, and has worked most satisfactorily. The area of the parish in statute acres is 1,716, giving a ratio of 40.8 inhabitants per acre. 140 Daring the year 2,680 births were registered in the parish, viz.:—Males 1,395, and females 1,285, being at the annual rate of 38.28 per 1,000 persons living. The annual rate throughout the Metropolis during the same period was 32.3. The births registered during the first quarter of the year were the highest, viz., 753, and during the third quarter the lowest, viz., 637. There were 1,355 deaths registered during the year, viz., males 677 and females 678. Eighty-five of these were of non-parishioners. Forty-seven deaths of parishioners were registered in public institutions outside the parish. Deducting the deaths of non-parishioners and adding those of parishioners occurring out of the parish, the deaths were equivalent to 18.1 per 1,000; the death rate throughout the Metropolis was 19. per 1,000. Of the deaths, 434 were of children under one year, and 255 of persons of 60 years and upwards. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Two hundred and fifty-five deaths were attributable to diseases of this class, being 18.2 per cent, of the total number of deaths, viz.:— Measles 57 Scarlet Fever 40 Diphtheria 12 Whooping Cough 50 Enteric Fever 13 Diarrhœa 81 Cholera 2 I shall refer to these diseases more fully when treating of the Sanitary Statistics. Eighty-nine inquests were held during the year. 39 were certified as from violence. I append a list marked "D," of all those which occurred since my appointment from 26th March, 1886. Two hundred and twenty-eight deaths occurred in public institutions, and four were registered as uncertified. Of the deaths in public institutions, 187, viz., males 102, and females 85, occurred in the Fulham Workhouse; 2 in the Female Convict Prison, Ful- ham; and 39, viz., males 22 and females 17, in the Western Asylums Hospital. The Birth Rate throughout the whole Metropolis was equal to 32. per 1,000 persons, and the Death Rate 19.9 per 1,000 persons. In the three previous years the death rate was 20.4 20.4, and 19.8 respectively. 141 The Mean Temperature of the air throughout the year was: First Quarter 365 Second Quarter 52-5 Third Quarter 61-2 Fourth Q aarter 44-6 water supply. According to the report of Dr. Frankland, the water supply to London has been entirely unprecedented throughout the whole number of years, during which -his systematic examination has been made. He further remarks that this marked improvement is entirely due to the greater care and superior method of working, which has been adopted by the several Water Companies, to whom the water supply of the Metropolis is entrusted. While on the subject of water supply, I would mention what I have already called the attention of your Sanitary Committee to, and through them to your Vestry, namely, the Act at present before the House of Commons to restrain the Water Companies from cutting off the water supply from houses where the landlord is liable for the rate and not the tenant. Several instances have occurred in the parish during the last year, and in one case 27 families were left without any water supply, the water rates collector sending me a letter to that effect. I do not consider that it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to become the rate collector for the water companies. work done by sanitary inspectors. The accompanying table marked " A," shows the work done by the Sanitary Inspectors in their respective districts, and the distribution of infectious diseases in each district. From this it will appear that the larger number of infectious cases which were reported occurred in the northern district. As, however, numerous cases occur, no notice of which reaches your Sanitary Officers, this is no criterion, most of the cases never come to my knowledge until after death, when it is generally found that several other cases of the same disease (chiefly during the past year scarlet fever and measles) may be traced. In one instance, first brought to notice through the death of a child, six other children in the same house were found infected, and the disease was rapidly spreading 142 throughout the street. I believe the death of that child, by drawing the attention of your sanitary authorities to the state of affairs, was the means of saving many lives, as some of the other children from the infected house themselves, actually suffering from the disease in a mild form, were freely playing in the streets with other children. I would ask, could there be a ease produced which more strongly proves the necessity for the compulsory notification of infectious diseases ? Every case of small pox, scarlet or enteric fever, which was reported during the year, and in which the consent of the parents or friends was obtained, was removed to hospital without delay. As a general rule, within two hours of the notice being received the case was in hospital. For this prompt removal, we have to thank the Ambulance Department of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. On one occasion when I reported a case for removal personally, the time occupied from the blowing of the whistle until the ambulance was out of the yard and on its way to the house of the patient, was three minutes twenty-five seconds. I have been informed by one of the district medical officers that they have been instructed, instead of informing your sanitary department of the occurrence of a case of infectious disease requiring removal to hospital, that they should telegraph direct to Norfolk Street. This, as far as the parish of Fulham is concerned, is in my opinion a mistake at least for the present, as unless your Vestry Officers are in telegraphic communication with the other establishments a delay will occur of at least twelve hours before a knowledge of the cases reaches your officers, causing delay in the disinfection of the premises, whereas, as the work has been carried on during the past year, notification of the disease being sent direct to me or to the Vestry Officers, every case has not only been removed, but the necessary precautions taken to prevent the spread of the disease within a few hours. The following table shows the death rate of the parish for the four quarters of the year ended 2nd April, 1887, and of the Metropolitan district for the same periods:– 143 Quarter Ended Fulham. Matropolis. June, 1886 1503 172 September, 1886 183 18.7 December, 1886 15.65 18.8 April 2nd, 1887 1714 20.7 The above shows that Fulham can favourably compare with the Metropolis at large. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES, BAKE-HOUSES, AND COW-SHEDS. Slaughter-homes.—These, eight in number, were personally inspected by me and periodically by the sanitary inspectors. On no occasion of my visiting them have I found anything of importance to find fault with, and they have been favourably reported on by your inspectors. One slaughter-house has been established anew, "with the full approval of your Vestry," by Mr. Boughton, of Hammersmith Road. This is fitted with all the latest sanitary improvements. Bake-houses.—These, 73 in number, have been all personally inspected by me, and periodically by your sanitary inspectors. I am sorry I cannot report as favourably on their condition as on those of the slaughter-houses, as although in some instances nothing could be more perfect, in others a great want of cleanliness and neglect of the Bakehouse Regulations prevails. In every instance, however, when served with notices, the defects have been remedied, but in some instances only to recur. Some of these cases will most likely be brought to the notice of your Sanitary Committee before long. Gowsheds.—These, 15 in number, have all been personally inspected on more than one occasion, and periodically by your inspectors. During the year two have been abolished, viz.:—that belonging to Mr O Connor, in Greyhound Road, and one to Mr. Beaumont, in Seagrave Road. One has been established anew in Stephendale Road by Mr. Saunders, and another is proposed to be established in the rear of Church Street, Fulham, by Mr. Green. It is questionable whether the latter should be allowed, but the matter is still sub-judice. 144 I have had very slight defects to find on my visits, and on a whole I believe the cowsheds in Fulham would bear comparison with any in the Metropolis. ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The following table shows the number of cases of this class reported to your Sanitary Authority from March 26th, 1886, to March 25th, 1887. Disease. Total number of cases reported. In Northern District. In Southern District. Removed to Hospital. Died.

The two cases of smallpox which occurred were immediately, on my receiving infirmation of them, removed to hospital; one occurred in the Burnthwaite Road, and the other in King's Road. In neither case was I able to trace the source of the infection. In both instances the residents in the house were re-vaccinated, and no second case occurred. The Metropolis has been virtually free from this disease. The total number of deaths registered from this disease during the year were 24. MEASLES. Of the 66 cases of measles reported, none were known to your Sanitary Inspectors until the death of one of the family appeared in the Registrar's return. This disease might be considerably checked in its progress were cases reported to the authorities, but the dread amongst the poorer classes of being deprived of their work from having the disease in their house appears to be an insuperable barrier. 145 SCARLET FEVER. Of the 82 cases of scarlet fever reported, 38 were removed to hospital ; six were not reported until after death and the others were treated at their own homes. DIPHTHERIA. Of the 12 cases of this disease which were reported, 8 died, of these 6 were not reported until after death. In one case the disease would appear to have been contracted in Hampshire. The other cases I consider due to the defective drainage of the houses, caused by stoppages or defects in the drain pipes. WHOOPING COUGH. Of the 17 cases of this disease, none were reported until after death. ENTERIC FEVER. Of the 16 cases, 3 were not reported until death; of the remaining 13, 7 were removed to hospital. DIARRHCEA. All the cases of this disease were of children, and were not reported until after death. 67 out of the 81 deaths occurred in the quarter ended September 30th, 1886. CHOLERA. Two cases were certified as dying from cholera, both occurring during the September quarter These were cases generally known as English Cholera, or Choleraic Diarrhoea. PUERPERAL PERITONITIS. Two cases of death from this cause were reported; in both cases precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the disease. NUISANCES.—GUERRIER NUISANCE. The action taken by your Vestry in this case, although nominally lost, through a technical mistake, was virtually a success, as it led to the Metropolitan Board of Works taking up the case, with the result that the works have to be closed by the 27th April, 1887. The greater part of the machinery has already been removed. 146 CORRISON OIL WORKS. Several complaints were received as to the nuisance arising from the smell caused by these works, and, as I reported to your Sanitary Committee on my visiting the Works on July 9th, I found them in a very unsatisfactory state. Since then the Company have spent some £300 in improving the works in such a manner as to render it almost impossible for any offensive odours to escape. SEWER VENTILATORS AND SEWER GAS. The nuisances arising from these may be attributed to two different elements. In two cases in the parish the reason may be referred to specific causes, viz., the Distillery and the District Railway. In the first case, in the process of distillation, two qualities of spirit are distilled, the one for use as a pure spirit, and the other for a spirit used for making Methylated Spirits. During the distillation of the former the waste flows into tanks, where it is stored for sale, whereas the waste from the latter (frequently distilled from rotten grain, which I have myself on more than one occasion seen on the premises) is poured into the main sewer, causing an emanation of a most unwholesome vapour from the ventilator in the Fulham Palace Road, impregnating the atmosphere for a considerable distance, and injurious to the health of passengers and residents in the neighbourhood. The District Railway creates a nuisance at the terminus at Fulham from the hot water discharged from their engines into the main sewer, which arises through the ventilator opposite Mr. Bailey s pottery. This vapour is impregnated with sewer gas, and is also, when it arises in column, as it frequently does, a source of great danger to vehicular traffic through frightening horses. These are cases which should be referred to the Metropolitan Board of Works to prohibit, as the sewers in question are Metropolitan and not parish sewers. The other nuisances, chiefly arising from the ventilators at the stunt headings, may be prevented either by erecting a ventilating shaft against the nearest flank wall, or which would be the more economical and easier method, the more frequent flushing of the 147 With regard to the drainage of houses, it would be a most important and advantageous step to take were your Vestry to compel builders to have the drain pipes, &c., inspected before being covered in, as I find that in many of the newest houses in the district complaints of the smells arising from defective drains are caused either from the joints in the pipes not being properly cemented, or from leakage due to the use of old pipes. GIPSIES. These nomadic residents, but non-ratepayers of the parish, have been the source of a great deal of trouble to your Sanitary Department. In one instance a serious outbreak of enteric fever was threatened, and were it not for the prompt action taken in removing to the mortuary the body of one of the members who hav died from the disease, where removal to hospital was refused while alive, and the compulsory removal to hospital under a threat of a magistrate's order of two other members of the family afflicted with the disease, a serious outbreak might have been the result. Every effort has been made to disburse their encampments but, with the exception of the ground at the end of Halford-road belonging to Colonel Gunter. who fenced it in, the result is far from satisfactory, as no sooner are they driven from one place than they move to another, only to return to their previous locality again as soon as disturbed in the other. Those who have the chief complaint against these interlopers are the owners and residents of the house property in the neighbourhood where they encamp, and were they to refuse a supply of water to the various vans and tents (a matter which should be taken up by the water companies), the gipsies could not remain on their camping ground. In one instance, that of O'Connor's ground in Greyhound-road, a property quite a nuisance enough in itself without the tents and vans of the unwholesome sojourners, rent is taken by the owner, which renders it still more difficult to deal with. Your Vestry may, however, be assured that every legitimate step will be taken to get the parish clear of them, but without the co-operation of the owners of the land and the occupiers of houses adjoining their encampments, the task is a difficult one. 148 the bishop's moat. The unsatisfactory condition of this moat having been reported to your Vestry, it was decided to request his lordship to allow it to be either filled up or to thoroughly cleanse it. I had a personal interview with his lordship on the subject, when he declined the proposal to abolish such an ancient and historical landmark. He was subsequently, by your direction, served in the usual way with a notice to cleanse it. This notice has been complied with. The Moat had not been thoroughly cleaned out since 1852, and was in a very unsanitary condition, the accumulation of mud and refuse being in some parts nearly seven feet in depth. schools. The various public schools in the parish were inspected during the year, and, with three exceptions, were satisfactory. The exceptions were— The Harwood Road Board School. St. John's National Schools. St. Thomas's Schools. In these schools the closets and urinals were kept in a most unsanitary and filthy condition, through the neglect of the caretaker in not properly flushing them, and perhaps a want of supervision on the part of the masters. These faults have been remedied, and will, I hope, not recur again. countess de la torre and her cats. This lady has become a great nuisance in the parish from the numerous cats which she congregates together. The house in which she resides is simply stinking from cats excrement, and the flooring of the various rooms is impregnated with feline urine. On a summons taken out by direction of your Vestry, Mr. C. Bennett granted a prohibitory order on the 2nd March,'and at present a summons for penalties for non-compliance with it is pending. 149 SUMMONSES. I append a statement marked " B " showing all the summonses taken out during the year, with the results. REMOVAL OF DUST, ASHES, &C. A statement marked " C " is annexed, giving the number of loads of dust, &c., removed from the 29th April, 1886 (the date upon which Inspector Witney commenced his duties), to the 31st March, 1887. SWINE. During the period swine were found to be kept at the following places, and were all viewed by a Sub-committee of the Sanitary Committee, viz., at— At 20, High Street, Mr. Carter, when served with a Notice, did not discontinue keeping swine, and was accordingly summoned, fined, and the nuisance removed. At 8, Peterboro' Lane, swine were kept, and ,at the first visit were not in proper condition ; subsequently the directions of your Committee were carried out ,and they decided not to interfere. Broom Farm, Taylor. 'These were also visited by your Committee, and although situated in a most isolated place were badly drained. Directions were given for the more effectual draining of the premises, which were carried out after being summoned. St. James Home. The pigs here were at a considerable distance from any occupied houses, but on the first visit they were in an unsatisfactory condition. This was found to be remedied on a second visit, and no further proceedings were taken. At Bank Side, where it was reported pigs were kept, none were to be found, but they had been removed to the premises in the occupation of Mr. Walden adjoining. They were beyond the prescribed distance from the road. Broom Lane, Fulham Palace, and Colehill House were all found to be satisfactory. 20, High Street Broom Farm Bank Side Fulham Palace Chelsea Station 8, Peterboro Lane St. James's Home Broom Lane Colehill House 20, Church Street 150 Chelsea Station. A summons was issued, when the owner was fined and the pigs removed. At 20, Church Street, a notice was served, and the pigs removed. In concluding this report I must bear testimony to the able manner in which your inspectors have discharged their duties, in not one single instance have either of them been absent when wanted no matter what the hour, and although, owing to no clerk being attached to this department, they have had to do all the clerical work, their duties have been done without a murmur. Finally, I would thank your Vestry and Sanitary Committee for the courtesy with which I have been invariably treated, and the assistance I have always received in the discharge of my duties. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANCIS EGAN, Medical Officer of Health. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of the Parish of Fulham. 151 A.—Statement showing Principal Items of Sanitary "Work carried out during the year ended 25th March, 1887, by the Sanitary Inspectors.
