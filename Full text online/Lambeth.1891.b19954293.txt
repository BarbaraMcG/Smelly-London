The Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 & 19 Vict., c. 120, Section 6, provides that in any parish in which the number of poor rate assessments at £40 or upwards does not exceed onesixth of the whole number of such assessments it shall not be necessary, in order to qualify a person to be a Vestryman, that the amount of rental upon which he is rated or assessed exceed £25. To ascertain if the present qualification of £40 remained unaltered, an examination of the Rate Books for 1892-3 was made by the Accountant of the Vestry with the following result: — No. of District. Total No. of Separate Assessments, including Prov. List No. 8. Total Separate Assessments of £40 and upwards. 1 3,364 719 2 3,199 697 3 3,263 441 4 3,784 270 5 3,572 540 6 3,278 774 7 3,281 641 8 3,370 382 9 3,506 671 10 3,095 435 11 3,093 489 12 3,266 1,045 13 3.437 578 14 749 150 44.257 7.832 One-sixth of Total Assessments is 7,376. Excess of Assessments at £40 or upwards over one-sixth of the whole number of Assessments 450. The qualification therefore remains at £40. J. H. ROBERTS, 13th May, 1892. Accountant to the Vestry. 33 BROCKWELL PARK. This Park, to which the public had been admitted since its first acquisition, was formally opened on Whit-Monday, the 6th June, 1892, by the Karl of Rosebery, formerly Chairman of the London County Council. The success of the opening ceremony was unhappily seriously marred by the sudden and untimely death of T. Lynn Bristowe, Esq, M.P. for Norwood, who, by his generous efforts, had been mainly instrumental in securing Brockwell Park for the people of South London. Mr. Bristowe, after taking part in the opening ceremony, was suddenly taken ill and expired on the ground. c 34 ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Under the Order obtained by the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, in the year 1889, various main lines were laid by the Company during the year 1891, but no active steps were taken by the Electric Installation and Maintenance Company, Limited, to lay down lines within the small portion of the Parish at Gipsy Hill included within the area granted to the Company under the Order obtained in 1890. The House-to-House Electric Light Supply Company took no steps under the Order obtained by the Company in 1890. The Order came into operation on the 4th August, 1890, and the Company should, prior to 4th February, 1891, have either deposited £1000, or secured the same, to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade. The Company were not then prepared to do either, and they applied to the Board of Trade tor an extension of four months; the Vestry not only assented, but offered to assent to an extension to the 4th August, 1891, and this additional extension was granted by the Board of Trade. When such extended period had expired, the Company were not even then in a position to deposit or secure the £1000. Under these circumstances the Vestry decided to ask the Board of Trade to revoke the Order, and this Order was duly revoked by the Board accordingly on the 29th January, 1892. On the 19th November, 1891, the Vestry decided to apply to the Board of Trade for an Order giving power to the Vestry itself under the Acts for the whole Parish, except the north end of the Parish included in the London Company's Order of 1889, and the small portion at Gipsy Hill included in the Electric Company's Order of 1890. The Clerk accordingly prepared the draft Provisional Order, and took the necessary steps to obtain the sanction of the Board of Trade thereto; this was eventually obtained and the Order was made by the Board for confirmation by Parliament during the Session of 1892, 35 PUBLIC LIBRARIES.

THIRTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the year 1891 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. In pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 & 26 Vict. cap. 102, sect. 43, I beg to present to your Vestry a Report for the year 1891, upon the vital statistics and sanitary condition of the Parish of Lambeth. Growth of Population. The total number of persons returned as living in Lambeth at 12 p.m. on April 5th was 275,202. This shows an increase of 21,503 upon the number returned at the previous enumeration of April, 1881. The actual a 2 growth during the ten years is at the rate of 8.5 per cent. The growth for any one year may be estimated at a rate approaching .85 or in round numbers 2150. Compared with former census periods the annual rate of increase has not been maintained. The decennium ending in the census year, 1871, exhibited an increase of 28.6 per cent., or an annual growth at the rate of 2.8 per cent. The following census period also shows a gain at the rate of 21.8 per cent., or an annual increase of 2.1. Population Registration Sub-districts. In the inner Registration districts of the parish the population has declined. Waterloo Road first Registration Sub-district has a population in 1891 numbering 1,164 less than in 1881. Waterloo Road second, 1,707 less. The decrease in Lambeth Church first has been 1,852, and in Lambeth Church second 712. The total decline of the inner districts is 5,435. The population of the outer districts, on the other hand, has increased,— Kennington first 5,354; Kennington second 4,376; Brixton 10,568, and Norwood 6,640, making a total increase in the outer districts of 26,938.

The North Lambeth Parliamentary Division of the borough of Lambeth, corresponding in area with the district covered by the three inner registration sub-districts and a part of the fourth, shows a decrease in population.

The decline of the population in the Northern Division is due to a decrease in the number of inhabited houses. The growth of the Brixton, Kennington and Norwood Divisions may in like manner be attributed to the increase in the number of inhabited houses. Inhabited Houses. 1881. 1891.

The lists of mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases include 685 parishioners and 105 strangers, being an increase of 26 upon last year's figures. Deducting the number of the strangers and adding the number of the deaths of parishioners who died in the outlying institutions, the total number of Zymotic deaths proper to Lambeth is 701. This represents a Zymotic death rate of 2 5 per 1000, the Metropolitan rate for the same period being 2.2 per 1000. • During the year 1891, under the Notification Clauses of the Public Health Act, 1685 cases of infectious disease have been reported. Of this number 515 were removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board, and 1170 remained under medical treatment at their own homes. In accordance with the resolution of the Vestry, a Sanitary Inspection was made and the drain test applied in every infected house. The infected houses numbered 1417, two or more cases occasionally occuring under the same roof. The sanitary defects discovered are grouped under two headings; under the first is found a list of such defects as are referable to the condition of traps, fittings and appliances. The second has special reference to the drains lying underground and to the soil pipes. 903 houses are reported as subject to nuisances arising from defects classed under one or both headings. In 316 houses faults in connection with the drains permitted the escape of sewage or sewer gas. But in all defects were observed in the traps, fittings and appliances. The existence of Scarlet Fever was notified in 695 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 435. Diphtheria made its appearance in 277 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 179. Typhoid Fever caused an examination to be made in 121 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 84. Erysipelas invaded 245 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 156. Continued Fever was 17 reported as present in 32 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 21. Croup claimed 29 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 16. Small Pox infected 3 houses, and sanitary defects were discovered in 1. In 6 houses Puerperal 1 ever complicated the lying in period of childbirth, and sanitary defects were discovered in 5. Diarrhoea having been notified under the application of Cholera attracted the attention of the Inspectors to 4 houses, all of which were the subjects of sanitary defects; and sanitary defects were discovered in a house occupied by a person notified as suffering from Relapsing Fever. In the following table the Zymotic death rate is compared in the different districts of the Parish, both for the whole year and each quarter of the year, cases of deaths of non-Parishioners are deducted.

During the year 1891 there was a slight increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, the number registered being 165 exclusive of 4 strangers, against 159 in the preceding year. In the Metropolis 2437 deaths were caused by Diarrhoea. The disease in Lambeth for the most part proved fatal in children; 150 of the cases registered arc those of children under 5 years of age, and 15 only above that age. July and August were the two most fatal months. 108 deaths were registered in those which proved the hottest months of the year.

The Water supplied by the Lambeth and the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Companies has been found throughout the year well filtered, with the exception, the details of which arc given at some length. On October 27th, samples of water supplied by the Lambeth and the Southwark & Vauxhall Companies were procured and submitted to the Analyst for examination. The samples were four in number, two being taken from the supply of each Company. No. 1 sample was taken from the Stand pipe at Knight's Hill. No. 2 „ „ the "Swan," Stockwell No. 3 „ „ Agnes Street,Waterloo Road No. 4 „ „ Kennington Cross 35 The Analyst's Report states that all the samples are London water in bad condition,-a condition usually assumed when the Thames is in flood. Of the Lambeth Company's water, the Analyst explains that the samples arc not the worst he has met with under similar conditions. Of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company's Water, the Analyst describes the samples as the worst he has met with. Description of Sample No. 1. From Knight's Hill.

This condition is also found, but not to the same extent when the river is not in flood. Section 4 of the Metropolis Water Act, 1852, provides that every Company shall effectually filter all water supplied by it, within the 37 Metropolis, for domestic use, before the same shall pass into the pipes for distribution. Section 35 and 36 of the amending Act, 1871, enacts that this provision shall be carried into effect by empowering the Board of Trade to appoint an examiner, and by prescribing the duties of the examiner. Little doubt, if any, need be entertained of the Water Companies using the best practical means at command for the improvement of their supply. That the supply has improved, having regard to the organic matters in suspension and solution, is evident from a consideration of Professor Frankland's Reports, issued during the last ten years. The organic matter discovered on analysis in the samples of 1890 averaged 45 per cent. less than in 1880, and the intervening years show a steady decline. On many occasions of testing during 1880 and the early years of the decade the organic matter in suspension was sufficiently apparent in the turbidity of the water. But in the later years of the decade, culminating in 1890, it had entirely disappeared from the samples. Admitting that filtration is as efficient as the circumstances of the case admit, yet the fact remains that the water supplied to the Parish of Iambeth for domestic purposes is of an indifferent character, and may be the means even when in its normal condition of conveying disease to those who employ it as a beverage. The cause however must be sought elsewhere than at the filter beds of the Water Companies. The cause of the polluted supply, is the polluted source. The river Thames above the Company's receiving pipes is contaminated with sewage gathered from a population estimated approximately at 600,000 persons. It is true that this volume of polluting matter is not discharged into the river in its crude state, but undergoes some process of settlement and deodorization before it reaches the stream. At flood time this sewage matter is augmented in volume 38 from the scouring of the ditches, and from the organic material suspended in the surface water, draining from agricultural lands constituting the water shed. Although much of the organic matter reaching the Thames is oxydised and rendered innocuous in the course of its transit with the stream, yet much remains in its unoxidised, and hence in a nocuous state. The best practical means of filtration known to science, although effective in removing the suspended impurities and a portion of the organic in solution, can under no conditions be relied upon, for the climination of the whole of the organic matters in solution. Indeed a large proportion of this material passes through the; best regulated filter beds. In the classification of waters made bv the Rivers Pollution Commission in 1874, the report under the heading of Suspicious and Doubtful Water, includes all river water which exhibits and proportion, however small, of previous sewage or animal con lamination, and as a reason for the classification it states, "That the Chemical Analysis cannot discover the noxious ingredien??? in water polluted by infected sewage, or animal excretion; and a it cannot thus distinguish between infected or non-infected sewage the only perfectly safe course is to avoid altogether the use for domestic purposes of water that has been polluted with excre??? mentitious matter." The power of the Vestry to deal with the short-comings of the Companies is not of a statutory character. On December 3rd however, the Vestry made a representation on the subject to the Board of Trade and the London County Council. H. WALTER VERDON, M.D., F.R.C.S.
