The Past Year. This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1897, to the 25th day of March, 1898. During this period 83 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 17 Special 4 Total 21 Committee Meetings— Finance 20 Law and Parliamentary 10 Sanitary 13 Works 19 Total 62 Making in all a total of 83 9 The Work of the Year. This Report contains a summary of the more important proceedings of the Board. It must only he regarded as a brief and much curtailed account of the work of the year. For fuller details the printed minutes must be consulted. Changes in the Personnel of the Board. Considerable changes have taken place in the membership of the Board during the year under review. At the election of members in June, 1897, Messrs. Samuel J. Coulson, William T. Douglass, Arthur Fox, Frederick German, Henry Jewell, Horatio Porter, Henry A. Thomson, and James W. Wolfe were elected in the place of Messrs. Charles Austin, Henry Cooper, James F. Corben, Samuel Cousens, John Drew, Walter Hazell, M.P., Arthur L. Leon, and J. Bamford Stack, who retired by effluxion of time. At the first meeting in June, 1897, Mr. Willoughby was re-elected Chairman of the Board, and on the 11th January, 1898, the Board received with great satisfaction the intimation that the Lord Lieutenant of the County of London had placed their Chairman's name on the Commission of the Peace. Accounts. The accounts of the Board for the past year have been prepared in the usual form, and after being examined by 10 the Board's Chartered Accountant, have been investigated by the elected Auditors, whose certificate of the result of their examination will be found appended at the foot of the accounts on page 45. The comparative statement of Income and Expenditure of the past year with that of the previous year is as follows:— COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1897, and 25th March, 1898.

St. Giles Public Library. The proceedings of the Commissioners, who are elected under the Public Libraries Act, 1892, are published 12 separately. In the month of June, 1897, an election took place to fill the vacancies caused by the retirement of Messrs. R. Garnett, J. Bamford Slack, and G. P. Willoughby, J.P. Mr. Willoughby did not seek re-election. Messrs. T. J. Hamp, J. Bamford Slack, and Edward Upton were appointed to fill the vacancies. Queen's Record Reign—Celebration in the District. The question of the means to be taken for celebrating in the St. Giles District the sixtieth year of Her Majesty's reign was considered by a Special Committee, and it was decided that as a permanent Memorial a drinking fountain should be erected at the junction of New Oxford Street and Shaftesbury Avenue. A design, submitted by the Engineer to the Board, of a fountain of polished and fine axed red and grey Aberdeen granite, set on two raised landings, was selected. The fountain, which measures 8ft. 6in. square at the ground line and 4ft. 2in. at the base of the fountain, with polished columns at angles, and has a total height of 14ft. 6in., with two dog troughs, was provided and fixed on the site in question at an expense of about £300. A memorial stone was laid by the Chairman of the Board, and the fountain, a photograph of which is bound with this report, was made available for public use on the 14th December, 1898. A respectful Address of Congratulation to Her Majesty was sealed at a special meeting of the Board held on the 15th June, 1897, and a reproduction of this will also be found with this report. The reply which was received Queeu's Most Excellent Majesty May it Please Your Mejesty.. WP your majesys loyas and dutiful subjects The Board of work for the saint district in the country of London desice to approach our majesty to respectfull offer our cougrstulation on the approaching complection of the sixtieth year of your reign as Queen of Great Britain and Iceland We desire to express our gratification at the great progress which has been made in Local Government during your majesty's reign, Municipal Authorities having constituted thereby promoting the welfare of nour subjects by improving the dwellings and preserving the Public Health. We pray that Your Majesty may still spaced many years to reign over a United Prople; that every blessing and happiness may be granted to Your Majesty during the coutinuance of your every memorable reign and assure Your Majesty of our denoted attachment to your person and Ghrone Scaled by Oder of the Board at a Special Meeting held on the 15th day of Sune 1897 in the presence of Clerk to the Board. 13 from the Secretary of State for the Home Department was to the effect that Her Majesty had been pleased to receive the Address very graciously. In response to a communication from the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of London, a committee was appointed for carrying out the necessary arrangements in connection with the provision of a meal for the outcast poor, and as a result the sum of £300 was received from the fund for providing food for the following number of persons 2,126 adults and 2,139 children, and the following quantities of food were distributed; for adults, 1,930 l1b. packets of sugar, 2,003 4oz. packets of tea, 2,021 plum puddings, 2,150 meat pies, 5521bs. of Cheshire cheese in 4oz. packets, 96 tins of condensed milk, 168 21b. tins of golden syrup, 721bs. Australian boiled beef in 61b. tins. For the children, 800 meat pies, ll,2601bs. of cake, 1,997 boxes of sweets. The balance of the fund unexpended amounted to £9 6s. 4d., and was returned to the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of London, and was with other unexpended sums devoted partly towards expenses, and the residue paid over to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales Hospital Fund. The Board, on receiving a report of the operations of the Committee, unanimously adopted the same and approved of the vote of thanks which had been passed by the Committee to their Chairman, Greorge P. Willoughby, Esq., J.P., and to the Clerk to the Board and the Engineer, and the Staff for the manner in which they had given effect to the wishes of the Committee. 14 Improvements. Several improvements, although not of a large nature, yet of considerable local importance, have been under consideration during the past year. They consist of the widening and improvement of Little Coram Street and Little Guilford Street, which are proposed to be incorporated as one thoroughfare under the name of Herbrand Street, where the necessary improvement has been carried out in consequence of the co-operation of His Grace the Duke of Bedford. An improvement in Portsmouth Street by the setting back of the line of frontage of the George the IV. public house is now in process of being carried out. This, with the further adjustment of the frontage of adjoining property, will eventually increase the width of Portsmouth Street to 30ft, and it is hoped that at some future time it may be possible to widen the whole thoroughfare up to Lincoln's Inn Fields so as to form a more adequate means of access to King's College Hospital and the Royal Courts of Justice than at present exists. A suggestion was also made for the adjustment of the line of frontage on the west side of Southampton Row between Vernon Chambers and Cosmo Place, but in consequence of the refusal of the Building Act Committee of the London County Council to sanction the scheme nothing came of the matter. Another improvement, which has engaged attention and which, although not strictly within the District yet is of great importance to it, received anxious consideration at the hands of the Board. It was the deposit by the 15 London County Council of a Bill for carrying into effect an improvement which the Board had for a long time been of opinion was most desirable, viz., the removal of the block of buildings standing between Bozier's Court and Tottenham Court Hoad. This was referred to in the last Annual Report, when it was stated that the Bill was then before the House of Commons. After a prolonged examination by a Select Committee the Bill ultimately received the Royal assent, and the London County Council are now taking the necessary steps with a view to the acquisition of the property and the carrying out of the improvement, which it is believed will be much appreciated. Electric Lighting.—Provisional Orders. In the course of the year communications were received from the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, Limited, and the Charing Cross and Strand Electricity Supply Corporation, Limited, applying for the Board's consent to the Companies applying to the Board of Trade for Provisional Orders for the supply of electricity for lighting, motive power, and other purposes to the St. Giles District. When the matter was first considered the Board were of opinion that the District was sufficiently served by the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company. Limited, and that having regard to the great number of persons Avho already possessed statutory powers to break up the public ways in the District, it was not desirable that any increase in the same should take place. Communications were opened up with the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, who expressed their willingness to reduce the rate of charge to private consumers as soon 16 as they could possibly see their way to do so. Under these circumstances the Board determined that no further extension of electric lighting facilities in the District was necessary. Subsequently the matter was again brought before the Board, when a memorial, signed by a very large number of inhabitants of houses and business premises in the District, was submitted, and having obtained from both Companies a statement of the prices at which they were prepared to supply energy, the Board determined that they would give their consent to both of the applications. In due course Provisional Orders were applied for, and, after modifications had taken place in the drafts with a view of affording further protection to the ratepayers, the Orders were confirmed by the Board of Trade and the necessary Bill for the confirmation of the same will be introduced into Parliament during the present Session. Metropolitan Electric Supply Company's Bill. The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, who are, under the terms of their Mid-London Order of 1889, supplying energy to the St. Giles District, are promoting a Bill for conferring further powers on the Company and enabling them to establish a generating station at Acton and Willesden, in the County of Middlesex, for the purpose of supplying electricity for, among other undertakings, their Mid-London Order. As it is possible that this legislation may injuriously affect the interests of the St. Giles District a Petition against the Bill has been presented, but at the time of preparing this report the proceedings on the Bill have been suspended, and the whole question of the generation of electrical energy and of 17 generating stations is under consideration by a Select Committee of the Houses of Lords and Commons, who are, taking evidence upon the subject. London County Council Tramways Bill. The London County Council having pursuant to Standing Orders, deposited Plans and Bill for the construction of a tramway from Theobalds Road to Bury Street applied for the Board's consent. The circumstances appeared in no way different from those referred to in the last report, when in January, 1897, at the urgent request of ratepayers with frontages in Bloomsbury Square, Hart Street, &c., the Board determined to withhold its consent to the operations. Under these circumstances the same course was adopted. The London County Council made strenuous efforts to induce the Board to alter its decision, but being unable to do so the Bill was abandoned. Sale of Food and Drugs Bill. In the last report the Bill introduced into the Housr; of Commons for amending the law relating to the sale of food and drugs was referred to. Subsequent to the date of that report a Bill was introduced by the President of the Local Government Board. Both these Bills were referred to the Sanitary Committee, who in due course received reports from the Clerk to the Board and the Analyst upon the subject, and the Board unanimously adopted a recommendation in favour of any Bill that might be introduced on the lines of the recommendations of the Select Committee, but the Board regret that no progress has yet been made with legislation on this all-important subject. 18 Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead Railway Bill. In the Session of 1894 an Act was passed conferring powers for the construction of a Railway from Charing Cross to Hampstead with a branch to Euston. The time within which the promoters were entitled to exercise their compulsory powers having expired a Bill was introduced for the extension of the same. From an examination of the proposed measure there did not appear to be anything in its provisions prejudicial to the interests of the District and no action was therefore taken on the Bill, which has since passed into law, but no steps have yet been taken towards the construction of the proposed Railway. Superannuation.—Metropolis Bill. The question of the superannuation of Officers is one which has always occasioned much anxiety to Local Anthorities. By an Act passed in the year 1866 power was conferred upon Local Authorities, if they thought fit, to grant superannuation allowances to their Officers, but no provision was contained in the Act requiring Officers to contribute towards a Superannuation Fund. In the year 1896 a measure for granting compulsory rights of superannuation to Poor Law Officers throughout the United Kingdom received the Royal assent, and in the course of the present session a Bill has been introduced which proposes to amend the Act of 1866 by bringing its provisions relating to the superannuation of Officers of Vestries and District Boards and other Parochial Bodies into line with those of the Poor Law Officers, by removing the uncertainty, and at the same time by requiring Officers of such 19 ties to contribute from their salaries a percentage allowance to the fund from which their retiring allowances will in future be paid. In due course the Board presented a Petition in favour of the Bill, which received a large measure of support from Local Authorities. At the present time the Bill is awaiting second reading. Metropolitan Municipalities. The question of London Government has again been engrossing public attention, largely in consequence of an intimation made in the Speech delivered at the opening of Parliament to the effect that a measure Avould be introduced for facilitating the creation of municipalities in the Administrative County of London. The question has for many years occupied the attention of the Board, but the Bill has not yet been introduced. Public Lavatories—High Holborn. The Public Lavatory constructed in High Holborn, referred to in the last report, was completed and opened for public use on the 22nd September last. It has already been found to supply a much-needed want in the District. On receiving a report of the completion of the work, the Board unanimously passed a vote of thanks to the Engineer upon the successful issue of his labours. The receipts at this and the other public lavatories in the District will be found set out in the annual accounts. Sanitary Work. The monthly synopsis of sanitary work, which is forwarded to every member affords a useful record of the 20 steps taken for preserving the public health in the District. Calculated on the information published month by month the following statistics are obtained:— Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Visits and Inspections made 10,265 Notices for Abatement of Nuisances served 1,090 Proceedings before Police Magistrates 43 Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, four representations were made by the Medical Officer of Health, and the necessary steps taken, with a view to closing the premises. The following are the particulars:— Locality. Present Condition of Premised. 66, Castle Street Closed. 1, Little White Lion Street Repaired and reopened. 12, Sardinia Street Closed. 33, Great Wild Street Repaired and reopened. Lodging House Regulations. Number of houses on the Register 545 Notices to abate breaches served 303 Proceedings taken 3 Number of additional houses registered during the year 116 Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. The Verminous Persons Bill, under the title of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, received the Royal assent on the 6th August, 1897. The Board referred it to the Sanitary Committee, who have under consideration the tsteps to be taken for carrying the Act into operation. At he present time, any persons applying to be cleansed and 21 disinfected, are dealt with by arrangement with the Guardians of the Poor at the Casual Wards, where they are bathed, while their clothing is disinfected in the Board's steam apparatus. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Four hundred and eleven samples of food and drugs were purchased and analysed during the year. The Analyst's report, which will be found on page 63, contains full particulars. It is sufficient here to remark that of the samples purchased 27 were adulterated, but in four cases the adulteration was not sufficient to justify any proceedings being taken; in the other cases prosecutions ensued, and fines and costs amounting in the whole to £35 14s. Od. were inflicted. Employees' Holiday. The precedent laid down by the Board in the year 1894, has been again followed. The whole of the employees received a day's holiday and a sum of £10 voted as an addition to the men's wages. The outing was as successful as those previously recorded. HENRY C.

Engineer's and Surveyor's Department, 197, High Holborn, W.C., June 14th, 1898. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the Works executed by your Board during the year ending 25th March, 1898. Pavings. Carriage-ways. Situation. Description of Paving.

Yorkshire stone 151 14 3 Montague Place Repairs to Yorkshire stone flagging and new granite kerb 429 15 8 Shorts Gardens from Endell Street to Neal Street Repairs to Yorkshire stone flagging and granite kerb 89 4 9 The macadamised roads in the District were repaired and made good with broken granite, a steam roller being used where necessary to level the surface. The laying of the Hydraulic main in Tottenham Court Road, hereinafter referred to on page 58 caused considerable disturbance of the asphalte roadway of that thoroughfare, and upon the French Asphalte Company being called upon under the terms of their contract with the Board to reinstate the paving, the Company represented to your Engineer the advisability of availing itself of the opportunity for relaying the whole area of the road, which the Company were under contract to maintain until the year 1903. Your Engineer assented to the proposals of the Company and the work was accordingly carried out in March, 1898, the street being relaid in two halves lengthwise of the street, to permit of vehicular traffic passing during the whole time the works were in hand. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. During the year contracts were entered into between your Board and the several Contractors who laid the 48 different pavements, for a further maintenance for 15 years of the following streets, at the prices named:— Per yard superficial per annum. s. d. Woburn Place 0 8 West. Street 0 6 Charing Cross Road 1 6 Drains. 147 applications were received during the year for the construction of new, and reconstruction of existing drains, at 172 premises within the District. The whole of the work laid was tested by the Board's officials before being covered in; the fees received in respect of the same amounted to £31 5s. Sewers. The following Sewer works were performed during the year:— *Kingsgate Street 590ft. run new 4ft. by 2ft. 6in. brick sewer. Eagle Street 140ft. ditto. Little Queen Street (north end) 115ft. run new 4ft. 0in, by 2ft. 6in. brick sewer. Chenies Street New Manhole. Upper Bedford Place Ditto. Hunter Street New side entrance and Manholes. Towards the cost of this work the Board of Works for the Holborn District contributed £175. 49 Cleansing Sewers. Certain of the sewers in the District which have dead ends, or in which the flow of sewage is not sufficient to enable the sewer to be self-cleansing, are fitted with flushing tanks. They are as follows:— Chapel Yard 450 gallons. Automatic selfacting syphon. Clarkes' Buildings 600 do. do. do. Clarkes' Mews 400 do. Slide penstock. Charing Cross Road 1,100 do.

The water used in the above tanks amounted to 1,186,000 gallons. The following sewers were flushed by water obtained from the New River Company's mains, through leather D 50 hose, during the summer months; the quantity of water used was 1,918,525 gallons:— Abbey Place. Alfred Mews. Bainbridge Street. Bedford Avenue. Bernard Mews. Calsen Yard. Charlotte Mews. Church Passage. Compton Mews. Dunn's Passage. Galen Place. Gate Street. George Yard. Goldsmith Street.

Queen Street. Redcar Yard. Ridgmount Gardens. Ridgmount Street. Serle Street. Southampton Mews. Stone Yard. Tavistock Mews. Tichborne Court. Woburn Mews. Woburn Mews East. The street gully pits, which intercept solid matter which would otherwise enter the sewers, were emptied, and their contents loaded into carts and taken away. The quantity thus removed amounted to 1,894 van loads; there were also 51 van loads of solid matter removed from the sewers, the total amounting to over 5,000 cubic yards. Street Cleansing. In March last Edward Cave, who had been Foreman of Scavengers for nearly 23 years, died, and on the advice of your Engineer it was resolved to appoint two Foremen in his place—one to assist the Inspector of scavenging and street watering, in superintending the work in the District north of High Holborn and New Oxford Street, and the other to perform similar duties south of those thoroughfares, the street sweepers being divided into four gangs instead of five as heretofore. 51 The street orderly staff therefore now consists of 50 men, and comprise 2 foremen, 4 gangers, and 44 sweepers. In addition to the manual labour employed, two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the carriage ways. The street sweepings carried away during the year amounted to a total of 6,329 van-loads, equal to about 19,000 cubic yards. The surfaces of the following public-ways were flushed twice weekly during the summer months; the quantity of water used amounted to 5,627,970 gallons :— *Bernard Mews. *Bloomsbury Court. *Castle Street.

D 2 52 The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares were washed frequently during the year by means of water distributed by watering carts. The cost of this washing is included in the two items for street cleansing and street watering, given hereafter. The main thorough fares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 and 2.30, when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants were added to the water in the carts. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year, including the Sunday work, was as follows:— Wages of men £3,638 2 10 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, etc., and clothing for men 481 17 11 Cartage of slop and street sweepings and hire of horses for street sweeping machines, removal of manure, etc. 3,525 8 0 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, etc. 19 3 5 Water for flushing surfaces of courts, etc. 157 7 6 £7,821 19 8 Street Watering. The watering of the public-ways was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for 53 the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in the district not available for vehicular traffic, or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used, including that used for washing the surfaces of the asphalte and wood paved roads, amounted to 4,926,000 gallons. During the summer months, permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering carts, one ounce being used to 400 gallons of water. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, etc., was £196 12 9 To Contractor for horse, carts, and drivers 1,010 16 0 For permanganate of potash 27 0 0 £1,234, 8 9 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,650. The refuse removed amounted to 10,830 van loads, equal to over 32,000 cubic yards. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's men, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £8 18s. 9d. 54 Limewhiting Courts. The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, etc., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year at a cost of £44:— Calsen Yard. Compton Mews. Denmark Place. Dunn's Passage. Hall's Yard. Henrietta Mews. Hunter Mews. Kennedy Court. Lascelles Court. Little Guilford Street. Middle Yard. Neal's Yard. New Yard. Nottingham Court. Plummer's Court. Portsmouth Place. Queen's Head Yard. Sardinia Place. Sardinia Street. Silver Street. Southampton Mews. Woburn Mews. Underground Lavatories. The Underground Lavatories in High Holborn to which reference was made in the last Report were opened to the public on the 22nd September, 3897. The accommodation provided for men is 18 urinals, 1.4 water closets, and three lavatory basins. The cost of the work was £4,346 7s. 10d., towards which a contribution of £200 was made by the Wenlock Brewery Company, in consideration of the removal of the urinal in Parker Street from in front of their premises, "The Running Horse"Public House, and £112 1s. 9d. was received as fees for the right of advertising on the hoarding enclosing the works, making the net cost to the Board £4,084 6s. 1d. As shewing the great use of underground lavatories, it may be interesting to give the result of a census of the persons using those within the St. Giles District, taken in January and February, 1898. 55 Men's Lavatories.

On the 28th July last, the Board received a communication from the Bedford Office to the effect that the leases of the houses on the west side of Little Guilford Street and Little Coram Street, being about to expire, the Duke of Bedford intended pulling down the property, as also the houses in Abbey Place, Tavistock Mews, and Woburn Mews at the rear, and, conditional on the Board paving, sewering, and lighting the same, the Duke would give up so much of the land as would widen the streets to 40 feet. The Board agreed to the proposals of the Duke, and the property has since been demolished, and contracts have been entered into by your Board for the necessary paving works. The work of widening the streets and paving them will be commenced shortly. This will effect a very great improvement in this portion of the District, cul de sacs in which ventilation was restricted, and a considerable area of old property which in its arrangement and conditions was far from sanitary, being done away with. The two above-named streets, with Colonnade Mews, which is also being widened on its western side by the Duke of Bedford, will form one continuous line of thoroughfare from Guilford Street to Tavistock Place, which has, with the consent of the London County Council, been renamed Herbrand Street. Queen's Jubilee. The year 1897, forming the completion of the 60th year's reign of Her Majesty the Queen Victoria, the Board appointed a special Committee to consider what steps 59 should be taken to commemorate the same in the District and on its recommendation your Board resolved to erect a Drinking Fountain in New Oxford Street at its junction with Shaftesbury Avenue. Various designs for the same were submitted by your Engineer, and considered by the Committee, who ultimately adopted one consisting of Corrennie and Rubslaw granite, grey and red in colour. The contract for the same was intrusted to Mr. John Fyfe, of Aberdeen, and the work of erection completed and the Fountain opened to public use, on the 14th December last. Kiosks. Application was made to your Board on the 15th May, 1897, by the Streets Syndicate, Limited, for permission to erect on the public way, on sites to be selected by the Board, certain kiosks, for advertising and telephonic purposes. Your Board, after considerable discussion, consented to the erection of the kiosks at the following situations:— High Holborn, South side, opposite No. 250. Refuge, North end of Shaftesbury Avenue, at its junction with New Oxford Street. High Street, at its junction with New Oxford Street. After their erection, the one in Shaftesbury Avenue was considered by your Board to be on several grounds in so unsuitable a position, that the Syndicate were requested to remove it to another site—that ultimately chosen being on the wide piece of footway on the south side of New Oxford Street, opposite the New West Central Post Office, recently erected in Hyde Street, 60 Underground Telephone Wires. On the application of the National Telephone Company, to lay cast-iron pipes to contain telephone cables beneath certain public-ways in the District, permission was granted by your Board on certain conditions which were embodied in an agreement entered into between the Company and the Board. The Company proceeded to lay the mains during the month of October in High Holborn, Broad Street, and Shaftesbury Avenue, extending from the eastern boundary of the District to the subway in Shaftesbury Avenue belonging to the London County Council, with a branch at Endell Street leading up to and along Bloomsbury Street, Bedford Square, and Gower Street as far as to the boundary of the St. Giles' District.

I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, Gr. WALLACE, Engineer and Surveyor. ANALYST'S REPORT. Clerkenwell Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, B.C. 7th June, 1898. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending the 31st March, 1898. The total number of samples examined during the twelve months was 406—a larger number than in the five preceding years, when the totals were as follows :— 1892-3 220 1893-4 266 1894-5 348 1895-6 318 1896-7 375 The 406 samples purchased during the year were all handed to me by the Board's Inspectors, Messrs. William 64 Henry Bond and John Robinson, who submitted 201 and 205 samples respectively. In the following table will be found a summary of the articles analysed during each quarter of the year and their nature and quality. ARTICLE. let Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

As in past years much attention has been given to the milk supply of the District, no fewer than 246 samples of this article having been submitted for analysis. Of these 15 were found to be of poor quality, only just escaping classification as adulterated samples by a narrow margin. Vendors of such fluids have, I understand, received special attention. Twenty-six samples were found to be adulterated either by the addition of water or by the removal of fat. The percentage of adulteration compares very favourably with that of the preceding year, the figures being 10.8 and 18.5 respectively. The nature and amount of the adulteration in each case are as follows:— No. of Sample. Nature and Amount of Adulteration. 1st Quarter (ending 30th June, 1897). G 377 At least 8.0 per cent. of fat removed. G 391 do. 9.4 do. do. G 31 do. 15.3 do. do. G 62 do. 20.0 do. do. G 5 do. 22.0 do. do. G 6 do. 22.4 do. do. G 375 do. 26.7 do. do.

G 370 At least 29.9 per cent. of water added, and at least 30.4 per cent. of fat removed. E 66 The amount of water added varied from 8*9 to 17*2 per cent, and the fat removed from 8 to 26'7 per cent. In three cases not only was water added but a considerable quantity of fat had been removed I cannot leave the subject of milk supply without pointing out the urgent necessity for some amendment of the law so as to afford greater facilities for proceeding against givers of false warranties. It is a matter closely related to milk supply.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you herewith my Annual Report of the St. Giles District, with the usual Vital Statistics for the Year ending 31st December, 1897. Area. St. Giles District comprises the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury, an area of 245 acres, nearly equally divided between the two parishes. For civil registration purposes it is formed into three sub-districts, viz:— 1. St. George, Bloomsbury. 2. St. Giles, South. 3. St. Giles, North. Houses. According to the Census 1891 there were 3,729 inhabited houses. The average number of persons in each house was 102. Population. The enumerated population of the District according to the quinquennial Census taken in March, 1896, was 38,237' a decrease of 14,462 persons since the Census enumeration of 1851. 72 Marriages and Marriage-rate. 1897. Population (Census 1896). Number of Marriages. Marriage- rate per 1,000.

The 880 persons married were equal to an annual marriage-rate of 23'0 per 1,000, a rate of 6.0 per 1,000 higher than that of the decennial average 1887-96. The 440 marriages were celebrated in the following Churches, Chapels and Buildings registered for the solemnisation of marriages. Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages.

In London the Marriages during the year numbered 41,223 and the persons married 82,446, equal to an annual rate of 18.5 per 1,000 of the population. In England and Wales the Marriage-rate in 1897 was 16.0 per 1,000, being the highest rate in any year since 1876 and 0.9 per 1,000 above the mean rate in the ten years 1887-96.

The ratio of births to population was 1 in 38.9. The natural increase of the population of the District during the year by the excess of births over deaths was 305, 74 The birth-rate of the parish of St. Gilea-in-the-Fields was 31.5 being 14.0 per 1,000 higher than that of the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The high birth-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-theFields was again largely caused by the great number of births at the Peabody Buildings, Great Wild Street, and the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. According to the Annual Summary of the RegistrarGeneral, there were 133,618 births registered in London, equal to an annual birth-rate of 30.0 per 1,000. The birth-rate in England and Wales in 1897 was 29.7 per 1,000 of the population, which is equal to the rate in 1896, and lower than that in any other year on record excepting 1894.

With these corrections the deaths for the three registration Sub-districts are:— St. George, Bloomsbury 187 St. Giles, South 350 St. Giles, North 139 Total 676 This number gives one death in 65.8 of the population, and is equal to an annual death-rate of 17.6 per 1,000, the average death-rate for ten years being 21.7, it is apparent that the death-rate last year was 4.1 per 1,000 lower than the decennial average 1887-96. The death-rate of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 22.0 per 1,000, being 10.4 per 1,000 higher than the rate of St. George, Bloomsbury. The 163 deaths at the Workhouse, and at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum largely contributed to this heavy death-rate. In all London the registered deaths were 80,943 equal to an annual death-rate of 18.2 per 1,000. In England and Wales the 541,426 deaths registered in 1897 were equal to a death-rate of 17.4 per 1,000, 76 which is lower than the rate in any previous year, excepting 1894 and 1896. The Mortality of Infants. Of the 676 deaths registered last year, 146 were infants under one year of age; this mortality of infants, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to registered births, was 148 per 1,000. The deaths of young children between the ages of one and five years were 70, giving a total of 216 deaths among children under 5 years. The diseases which caused the greatest fatality among children under 5 were :—Bronchitis, 39; premature birth, 20; convulsions, 19; atrophy and debility, 17; whooping-cough, 17; diarrhoea, 14; enteritis, 13; and suffocation in bed with parents, 9. In England and Wales, the rate of mortality among infants under one year of age to 1,000 registered births was 156, which was 8 per 1,000 above the mean roportion in the ten years, 1887-96. Senile Mortality. The mortality among persons aged 65 years and upwards was 138. The deaths occurred at the following advanced ages : 42 between 65 and 70 years. 68 „ 70 „ 80 „ 27 „ 80 „ 90 „ and 1 at 92 years. 77 One hundred and six of the deaths were caused chiefly from diseases of the brain, heart, and lungs; 32 died from "decay of nature." Uncertified Deaths. In 1897 no death was registered as "uncertified." This is the third year in succession that every death has been duly certified either by a duly qualified Medical Practitioner or by the Coroner. In all London 0.6 per cent. of the deaths were not certified. In England and Wales there were 11,071 cases or 2.0 per cent. It is unsatisfactory that any death should be registered as "uncertified," it ought to be obligatory in default of a Medical Certificate or Inquest that a postmortem examination should be ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of death. Deaths in Public Institutions (within the District). 1.—The Parish Workhouse, Endell Street. During 1897 the number of inmates was 628. The number of deaths during the year amongst them was as follows :— 1st Quarter 36 2nd Quarter 30 3rd Quarter 27 4th Quarter 28 Total 121 This equals an annual death-rate of 19.2 per 1,000. 78 37 of the 121 were deaths of non-parishioners or described as "unknown." In addition to the deaths at the Workhouse, 42 parishioners died at the Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street, where they were received for Medical treatment. Of the 29 notifications of infectious cases received were 28 from erysipelas. The one from enteric fever was contracted outside the Workhouse. 2 — The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. There were 32 deaths, 26 were non-parishioners. 24 of the deaths were caused from diseases of the heart and lungs. There was one zymotic death, from enteric fever, and one from accident—"fracture of the ribs." 24 of the deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65 years, and 3 above 65. 3.—The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. This is the oldest lying-in hospital in London; it was founded in 1749, and rebuilt in 1849 for the purpose of assisting poor married women at their delivery. The Medical Report for 1897 states that during the year 187 women were delivered in the wards with one maternal death. The patient was in a dying condition from complication of heart and lung mischief on admission, and her case was hopeless. The total number of children born was 189—of these one died 7 days after birth from debility. 79 In the out-patient department 390 mothers were delivered, 8 children were born dead, and 4 others died within a few days of birth, but there was no maternal death. Deaths in Hospitals, Lunatic Asylums, Workhouse Infirmaries, and other places situated outside the District. According to the Weekly Returns furnished to me from the Registrar-General's Office, Somerset House, 199 Parishioners belonging: to the united Parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury, died in the following outlying public Institutions:— Institution.

There were 42 births, equal to annual birth-rate of 30.2 per 1,000, and 20 deaths, corresponding to a deathrate of 14.3 per 1,000. There were five zymotic deaths, viz.: diphtheria 1, measles 1, and diarrhoea 3, these equalled a rate of 3.5 per 1,000. Thirteen of the total deaths, including those from the infectious diseases, were those of young children. 81 Twenty-two notifications were received, viz.: scarlet fever 14, diphtheria 5, enteric fever 1, erysipelas 1, and membranous croup 1.

There were 24 births, equal to a birth-rate of 30.5 per 1,000, and 9 deaths (3 adults and 6 children), corresponding to the low deathrate of 11.4 per 1,000. There were 3 deaths from infectious disease, causing a zymotic death-rate of 3.7 per 1,000. 15 notifications were forwarded respecting 9 cases of scarlet fever, 5 of erysipelas, and 1 of enteric fever. The Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund, in their 33rd Annual Report for the year 1897, state that the net gain of the year from rents and interest has been £32,320 0s. 3d. At the end of the year the Trustees had provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London 11,367 rooms. The average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9½d. a week, F 82 and of each room 2s. 2d. The number of persons in residence on the 31st December last was 19,741, showing a mean density of 725 people to the acre, or nearly 13 times that of London. The birth-rate for the year was 34.9 per 1,000, which is 4.9 per 1,000 above that of all London for the same period. The death-rate was 15.4 per 1,000, which is 2.8 per 1,000 below the average of London. The infant mortality was 137.3 in each 1,000 births, or 21.9 below that of London. 2—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes.

Class 1.—Specific Febrile or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases, called "Zymotic," comprises in the Registrar-General's arrangement of the causes of death, six orders. The first and second orders ("miasmatic" and "diarrhoeal") include the diseases which the Registrar-General describes as the seven principal diseases of the zymotic class; the term "fever" includes "typhus," "enteric or typhoid" and "simple continued forms of fever." The zymotic death-rate is made up from these seven diseases, as they are considered to be more or less of a preventable character. In St. Giles' District the 63 deaths were equal to a zymotic death-rate of 1.6 per 1,000, a rate 0.6 per 1,000 lower than the one for the preceding year, and 0.5 lower than the rate for the decennial average. In Registration London the same diseases caused 11,513 deaths, equal to a rate of 2 56 per 1,000. In England and Wales 67,051 deaths were attributed to these zymotic diseases, corresponding to a rate of 2T5 per 1,000 living, against 2.17 and 2.21 respectively in the preceding two years. MIASMATIC ORDER. 1.—SMALL-Pox (decennial average, 0.7). Year. No. of Notifications Received. Removals to Hospital. No. of Deaths. 1897. *4 *4 015 88 During the Quarter ending December, 1896, there were only 4 admissions of small-pox patients to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board from the whole of London. During the Quarter ending March, 1897, there were 70 admissions and 13 deaths. During the Quarter ending June, 1897, there were 20 admissions and 1 death. During the Quarter ending September, 1897, there were 5 admissions and no death. During the Quarter ending December, 1897, there were no admissions. In January and February, 1897, there were 4 sudden outbreaks of the disease over the Metropolis in 5 separate groups as follows:— 1. At Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich. 2. At Camberwell Infirmary. 3. At Great Russell Street (St. Giles-in-the-Fields). 4. At Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street (Strand District). 5. Connection unknown. Small-pox was absent from St. Giles District from August, 1895, until January, 1897, when 3 cases were notified from a private lodging-house in Great Russell Street (Group 3). The particulars are as follows:— No. 1. L.O., a female, aged 39, housekeeper, was taken ill about the end of December, 1896, and detained at home, where she was treated for chicken-pox. No. 2. A male, aged 26, husband of the above, vaccinated in infancy, contracted small-pox from No. 1. No. 3. A female, aged 21, related to Nos. 1 and 2, vaccinated in infancy, also contracted the disease from No. 1. 89 In addition to these three cases 2 or 3 friends who visited the house were supposed to have caught the disease there. No 4*. On 28th June, a notification was received that a child aged 11 years residing in Betterton Street, was suffering from small-pox the patient was promptly removed to the shelter at South Wharf, Rotherhithe, but was sent back the same day, the disease being pronounced chickenpox. The total number of patients certified to be suffering from small-pox removed in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Ambulances from their homes was 121, 26 of these were immediately returned, the diagnosis not being confirmed, leaving 95 which were admitted to the Managers' Hospitals. Again 34 of this number were found, after observation, not to be suffering from the disease, and were sent home. This makes a total of 71 cases confirmed out of a total of 121 removed. The total deaths from small-pox in England and Wales during 1897 were 25. 2.—Measles (decennial average 26.3). The 9 deaths in 1897, all young children, were considerably below the average. Of the total deaths only one occurred during the first 3 quarters of the year. Measles is a highly infectious disease, and very liable to prove fatal unless proper care is taken of the patient and medical advice sought for in the earliest stages of the complaint. The Local Government Board has not yet sanctioned 90 the notification of measles as one of the infections diseases, though many Local Authorities are in favour of it. Some Medical Officers of Health consider the notification of Measles undesirable on the ground that it would be useless, as at the present time the Asylums Board does not possess the requisite hospital accommodation necessary for the reception of these patients. Personally I am not in favour of removal on account of the majority of the patients being attacked at so early an age, but I consider notification desirable, as it would enable the Sanitary Authority to visit, with a view of excluding children from attendance at public schools from infected homes. 3.—Scarlet Fevkr (decennial average 6.5). Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospital. No. of Deaths in Hospital. No of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1897 205 164 6 1 7 The 7 deaths in 1897 (6 children under 5 years of age) were again slightly above the average. It will be seen from the above table how largely the hospitals of the Asylums Board are made use of for the treatment of this disease. A breach of Section 70 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891 having coming to my knowledge in November, when a child suffering from Scarlet Fever was removed in a street cab to a railway station and thence by train to a 91 suburban town, the parents were summoned to Bow Street Police Court, where the magistrate inflicted fines amounting to £6 and £3 5s. 0d. costs. It was ascertained that no intimation of the nature of the disease had been given either to the cab driver or the Railway Authorities. 4.—Diphtheria (decennial average 14.2). Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospital. No. of Deaths in Hospital. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1897 54 41 4 in General Hospitals 1 at Asylums Board 1 6 The 6 deaths of children in 1897 were considerably below the decennial average 14.2. Of the 41 removals to hospital 16 were admitted to the Asylums Board, and 25 to general public hospitals. "The prevalence of diphtheria in London during the fifty two registration weeks of 1897 was as shown by the returns actually and relatively a good deal less than that recorded in the 52 weeks of the preceding registration year. "In 1896 the 14,224 notified cases yielded an average weekly total of 268, and the 12,811 attacks in 1897 produced an average of 246 cases weekly. "The 2,683 deaths in 1896 yielded a case mortality of 18.9 per cent. The deaths fell to 2,262 last year, and yielded a case mortality of 17.7 per cent. 92 "Hence last year there was a fall both in the amount, and the fatality of diphtheria in the Metropolis as compared with 1896" (Lancet). The following is a copy of a letter received from the Managers of the Asylums Board in reference to a supply of anti-toxic scrum being sent out to the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health for distribution amongst Medical Practitioners in the District when their patients, suffering from diphtheria, are unable to obtain admission into the Board's hospitals:— Norfolk House, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 21 st December, 1897. Dear Sir, You are probably aware that for some time past the Managers have been in the habit of distributing, through their Medical Superintendents, a supply of anti-toxic serum for the use of patients suffering from diphtheria, who are unable to obtain admission into the Board's hospitals. Under the existing arrangement a "warrant for the gratuitous supply of anti-toxic serum is forwarded from this office to every general practitioner who is unable to obtain the immediate removal of a case of diphtheria to hospital, and this warrant is despatched by post from this office to the Medical Practitioner immediately it is distinctly ascertained that the patient cannot be received into one of the Board's hospitals. The Managers however have reason to believe that in some cases (from causes beyond their control), delay has occurred before antitoxin is in the hands of the Medical Practitioner, and they think that its distribution may in many cases be accelerated by placing a supply in the hands of the several Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health, as well as in the hands of the Board's Medical Superintendents. With this object I am directed to enquire, whether in the event of pressure upon the Boards accommodation again necessitating the temporary refusal of diphtheria cases, you will be willing to receive and distribute the serum in the manner proposed ? Should you be 93 willing to do this, a supply with full directions as to use, will be sent to you directly the emergency may be expected to arise, from the laboratory at the Examination Hall of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, Victoria Embankment, W.C. Yours faithfully, (Signed) T. DUNCOMBE MANN, Clerk to the Board. To Dr. S. R. Lovett, Medical Officer of Health, Bloomsbury. I replied to this communication expressing my willingness to accede to the request. 5.—Whooping Cough (decennial average 18.2). Of the 18 deaths from it in 1897, 10 were infants under 1 year, and 7 between 1 and 5 years. Both whoopingcough and measles are practically epidemic every two years. The poor, as a rule, consider them trivial, and necessary diseases of childhood, consequently the doctor is seldom consulted about them until serious symptoms set in. 6.—Continued Feveks (decennial average 7.1). Year. No. of Notifications received. Removals to Hospital. No, of Deaths in Hospital. No. of Deaths at Home. Total No. of Deaths. 1897 31 Asylums' Board 7 General Hospitals. 17 5 1 6 Continued fevers include "typhus", "simple continued" and "typhoid." In 1897, all the cases notified were of the enteric or typhoid form. Of tne 31 cases reported, 6 were fatal, 94 None of the cases were traceable to the Maidstone or any other local outbreaks, which were reported in the Autumn. The deaths occurred as follows:— Date. Sex and Age. Residence. Jan. 5th M. 28 Non-parishioner. Jan. 15th F. 10 35, Great Queen Street. Feb. 27th M. 14 2b, Peabody Buildings, Little Coram St. March 12th F. 25 244, High Holborn. July 11th M. 9 21, Dyott Street. Nov. 7th M. 47 32, Great Queen Street. Enteric fever is nothing like so infectious as diphtheria or scarlet fever, one of the principal dangers, especially in the autumn, is drinking a specifically infected water supply. The attention of householders should be frequently drawn to the necessity for the periodical cleansing of cisterns containing drinking water. These cisterns should bo properly covered to exclude light and dust, and should be conveniently placed for examination and cleansing. 7.—Diarrhcea (decennial average 205). The 17 deaths in 1897 were 3 below the average; 14 were of young children and occurred during the hot weather in August. One of the chief causes of diarrhoea during the Summer months is the decomposition of milk in the feeding bottles of infants. 95 Infectious Diseases.—Notifications. Excluding London, where it is compulsory, notification is adopted in 654 out of a total of 671 Rural Districts, and in 904 out of 1088 Urban Districts. In St. Giles District daring the past year 433 Certificates, including 41 duplicates, were received from Medical Practitioners under the 55th Section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Small-pox. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Membranous Croup. Enteric Fever. Puerperal Fever. Erysipelas. Total. Average for the 3 yrs., 1894-5.6.

This accounts for the discrepancy between the two returns. The Annual Report of the Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board points out that both scarlet fever and diphtheria were less prevalent during the year 1897 than in 1896. Of scarlet fever (all London) 22,850 cases were notified, as compared with 25,647 in 1896; and of diphtheria, 12,803 cases, as against 13,362 in the previous year. Infectious Diseases.—Removals to Hospitals. The following table shows the number of patients suffering from infectious diseases received into the 96 Asylums Board Hospitals and the general public hospitals during 1897, from the St. Giles District:— Diseases. Asylums Board Hospitals. General Hospitals. Total. Small-Pox 4* — 4 Scarlet Fever 168 - 168 Diphtheria 21 20 41 Enteric Fever 7 17 24 200 37 237 * One case returned as Chicken-Pox. The total number of fever patients removed from all London to the Asylums Board Hospitals during the year was 22,795 as compared with 22,152 in 1896. The removals of small-pox patients numbered 121 as compared with 265 in 1896. The aggregate removals of infectious cases during the year including the transfer of patients from one hospital to another numbered 42,758. Ambulance Arrangements. Patients from the St. Giles District are removed by the staff at the Western Station which adjoins the Western Hospital at Seagrave Road, Fulham, S.W., between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.; on weekdays cases for removal are reported at the Manager's Central Offices, Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, Strand, W.C., these being in telephonic communication with the station. During the night, and on Sundays, and on Christmas Day and (rood Friday, application for a patient's removal is for CHART SHOWING WEEK BY WEEK THE NUMBER OF CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Notified by Medical Practitioners as having occurred in the St. Giles District during 1897. 97 warded direct to the Ambulance Station. The Manager's telegraphic address is "Asylums Board, London," their telephone numbers are, "2858 and 2859—Gerrard." OTHER MIASMATIC DISEASES. Asiatic Cholera. No notification was received during 1897 of any person arriving in the District from Foreign Ports infected with Cholera. The Plague In Bombay. In conformity with the general order of the Local Government Board as to regulations respecting Cholera, Plague, and Yellow Fever, viz, that "no person on board an infected ship shall be permitted to land unless he satisfies the Medical Officer of the Port as to his name, intended place of destination and intended address, which is to be communicated to the Local Sanitary Authorities in order that their Officers may keep such persons under observation,"I received the following communication:— Port Sanitary Office, Audit Street, Southampton. 7th April, 1897. Sir, I have to inform you that the following passenger has arrived in apparently good health by the Troopship "Dilwara," from Bombay, on board which a death from Plague occurred, and is proceeding to your District,— Corporal Dillon, 13, Arthur Street, W.C. A. W. Harris, Port Medical Officer. G 98 Upon receipt of this information, I visited Corporal Dillon, and found him to be in good health. Plague which has been so prevalent in India, might readily be introduced by merchandise into this country, if due precautions were not taken by the several Port Sanitary Authorities to prevent its introduction. In reference to the great Plague of London in 1665 I have read that this District suffered severely from the disease, and that there were 3,216 interments from it in the burial grounds of St. Giles-in-the-Fields alone. Influenza. There were six deaths as compared with 23, 34, and one, in the preceding three years respectively. The deaths in 1897 were all adults between 25 and 65 years of age. According to the Registrar-General's weekly returns, Influenza mortality prevailed in London throughout the year, and that no less than 671 deaths were attributed to it. The progress of influenza seems irresistible, and there appears to be no known method of escaping from its infection. It is stated that horses and probably most other animals, including cats, which probably often serve as channels of infection, are liable to the disease. The disease is no doubt carried through the air by the prevailing winds to long distances, for it is heard of in all directions. 99 II.—Constitutional and Tubeucular, Diseases. The diseases of this important class, which include malignant cancer, tabes mesenterica, meningitis, phthisis, and other forms of scrofula and tubercular disease, accounted for 186 of the total deaths, the majority occurring between the ages of 25 and 65. One hundred and twenty nine of these were due to phthisis or consumption of the lungs, and 22 to cancer. Local Diseases. There were 347 deaths in this class, which comprises 11 orders, viz., diseases of nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, lymphatic, urinary, generative, locomotive, and integumentary systems, also diseases of organs of special sense and accidents of childbirth. The diseases of 2 systems, viz., the circulatory and respiratory, accounted for 181. The greatest fatality was again amongst the very young and old, viz., 95 children under 5 years of age and 77 aged. G 2 100 IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths. Inquests and Coroner's Court.

Some were brought in by the relatives of the deceased, others by the police, but the majority were sent in by the order of the Coroner. Four who died from infectious diseases were deposited in the chamber set apart for the purpose. Post-mortem examinations were made in 38 Cases. The total number of bodies received since the opening of the building in 1883 is 1,047. Bye-laws as to Houses let in Lodgings. (54 and 55 Vic., Cap. 76 ; Sec. 94, Sub-sec. 1.) Section I. replaces 29 & 30 Vic., Cap. 90, and 38 Vic., Cap. 89, and gives power to Sanitary Authorities to make and enforce bye-laws as are requisite for the following matters, that is to say, (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house, which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage of such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. 103 (e) For the cleansing and limewashing at stated times of the premises. (/) For the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. Section II. does not apply to common lodging houses within the Common Lodging-Houses Act, 1851, or any Act amending the same. In this District the following 575 houses are registered under the regulations made by your Board, and confirmed by the Local Government Board in 1887, and which have been continuously employed with the most satisfactory results.

Provisions as to Inhabited House Duty upon Houses Constructed in Separate Dwellings. Certificates under Section 26 of the above Acts were asked for and granted to the Owners of the following premises, which, after inspection, were found to be so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families inhabiting them, and that due provision was made for their sanitary requirements.

During the year I inspected the undermentioned houses which had been newly erected, and found that they had a proper and sufficient supply of water, viz., Clarke's Mews Stable and Workshops. Clarke's Mews Milk Stores. 21, New Yard Stable. 22 do. Printer's Shop. 18, Little Queen Street Tavern. 141, 142, 143, and 144, Drury Lane Tobacco Manufactory. 51, Marchmont Street Tavern.

Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. (Chapter 31.) This Act permits Local Authorities to provide Cleansing and Disinfection of Persons infected with Vermin. During August, a man residing in a Common LodgingHouse came to the Stone Yard, and requested to have the free use of the disinfecting apparatus for cleansing his person and his clothing from vermin. He stripped in one of the sheds in the yard, and put on a clean shirt and trousers, which he brought with him. His dirty clothes were then disinfected in the Washington Lyons Steam Apparatus, and returned to him, excepting trousers and shirt, which at his request were destroyed. Sanitary Work of the Year. Table VI. Appendix gives a summary of the work carried out during the year by the Sanitary Inspectors 108 under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878 to 1891. Inspections and Oedees. Inspectors Bond and Robinson made 10,287 visits and inspections and served 1,188 notices for the abatement of various kinds of nuisances, and the sanitary amendment of houses and premises: Legal Peoceedings. A large number of nuisances were removed on an intimation only; others required statutory notices to be served before the necessary work was done; and legal proceedings had to be resorted to in 42 cases to enforce the orders of your Sanitary Committee. In every case brought before the Magistrate, convictions with costs, were obtained. Before legal proceedings are taken I inspect the nuisance in question and report to your Clerk as to the necessity of a summons being applied for. Overcrowding. The Sanitary Inspectors found 18 rooms overcrowded and served notices on the owners to reduce the number of inmates. It is not easy to detect overcrowding, as during the day many of the occupants are away from home and do not return until midnight. If the rooms were inspected after 12 at night, it is very probable that overcrowding would frequently be discovered, but Inspectors' visits at night time to tenement houses might probably lead to friction and trouble. One of the causes of overcrowding in poor districts is the front door being always open at every man's command. 109 Underground Dwellings. Twelve underground rooms reported to be illegally occupied as sleeping places were order to be closed. Underground kitchen cellars flourished at the time of Charles the First, and numbers of such dwellings are recorded to have existed in Dudley Street and other parts of the district, until the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, when stringent measures were taken to prevent their occupation. Animals Improperly Kept. A number of pigeons, fowls and dogs were ordered to be removed from rooms and premises as they were found to be a nuisance, injurious or dangerous to health. Unsound Food. Parcels of fish and baskets of vegetables found to be unsound and unfit for food of man were from time to time brought to Stone Yard and destroyed. The Market and other streets where food is sold are regularly kept under observation, and are visited by the Inspectors every Saturday evening. Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. 118 Factories. Workshops, &c., were periodically visited by your Officers, and in all cases where it seemed to be necessary, measures were taken to diminish the number of persons in workshops so as to prevent overcrowding and to enforce the provisions as to cleanliness, ventilation, drainage &c. In several instances where workpeople of both sexes 110 Were employed, separate W.C. accommodation was ordered to be provided. In accordance with section 27 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, notices were duly forwarded to the Factory Inspector of the District, where it was found that women, young persons, or children were employed. Slaughter-Houses. At a special meeting of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the London County Council, held on the 25th October, licenses were renewed for the undermentioned premises used as slaughter-houses:— Locality. Licensee. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. C. Shortland. No. 23, Store Street Mr. Wm. Kingsmill. Previous to the licensing day your Sanitary Committee visited the several premises, and on their recommendation the Board forwarded to the London County Council a resolution, "That the Board is still of opinion that Slaughter-houses and Cowhouses should not exist in crowded districts in the Metropolis." In 1874, the number of Slaughter-houses in London was 1,500, in 1896 the number was reduced to 469. Cow-House. At the same meeting, the Committee renewed the license to Mr. Jones for his Cow-house:— Locality. Licensee. Dimensions of Shed. No. of Cows Allowed. No. of Cows in Shed at date of Renewal of License. No. 4, Goldsmith Street Mr. E. Jones 7,246 cubic feet. 9 4 1ll Bakehouses.—Section 26.

Lists of infected premises are furnished to the Librarian of the St. Giles Public Library to prevent the issue of books to such houses. During the summer months, weekly lists of infected premises are sent to the Committee of the Children's Holiday Fund. Disinfectants. By order of your Board the disinfectants used for the following purposes are 1. Chloride of Lime, containing not less than 30 percent. of chlorine, for disinfecting the soil and refuse matter removed from the catch-pit gullies and sewers and house drains. 2. Sanitas Powder and Fluid, for use in the Mortuary and post-mortem room. 3. Permanganate of Potash (crystals) in street, watering and flushing of courts and alleys. 4. Perchloride of Mercury, for the disinfection of drains, sewers and gulley-pits. A Mixture of this is made in the proportion of:— Perchloride of Mercury 8 ounces (3,500 grains). Methylated Spirit 2 pints. Aniline (green) half an ounce. Water to make 50 gallons. 5. Tuson's Liquid Disinfectant, for the underground conveniences. H 114 6. Kuna Pine, for use in the Mortuary and postmortem room. 7. Carbolic Acid (pale), containing not less than 95 percent. of available Carbolic Acid for disinfecting urinals. 8. Carbolic Acid (prepared), soluble in water, containing not less than 25 percent. of available carbolic acid. (This is not used as a disinfectant, but only for tracing drains.) 9. Carbolic Acid Disinfecting Powder, containing not less than 15 percent. of available carbolic acid for deodorising dustbins. 10. Carbolic Acid Crystals, free from staining properties and corrosive matter, for use in the underground conveniences. In conclusion I regret that during the past year no bye-laws have been made for the conduct of the business of a marine store dealer, nor has any legislation been enacted for regulating the making and vending of ice creams to children in the public streets.
