Arrangements were made with Mr. Sugg to provide proper meters, which have been fixed accordingly. PUBLIC URINALS.

The Urinals are flushed and cleansed with water by men employed by the Board, and have been maintained in good order. CLEANSING & WATERING. The principal streets are cleansed daily, and the others every second day, but daily in bad weather. During the past season the whole of the streets, &c., have been constantly watered by the Contractors with water from the East London Water Works. RENAMING STREETS, & RENUMBERING HOUSES THEREIN. The Metropolitan Board of Works have made orders for renaming High Street, Stepney, Stepney High Street, and re-numbering the houses in Love Lane, partly in Ratcliff, and partly in Shadwell. CONTRACTS. The Contract for Sewer Works, &c , having expired at Midsummer, 1879, the same was, after consideration by the Works and Survey Committee, renewed with the contractor for a further term of 2 years, upon the same conditions as before, with the exception of a small increase on same of the items for laying pipe sewers and drains. GENERAL WORKS. An iron foot-bridge has been placed across Wapping Wall, Shadwell, to connect the Metropolitan Wharf with the new buildings on the north side of the street, in accordance with the terms of the agreement entered into with the owners when the thoroughfare was widened and improved by the Board. An iron foot-bridge has been placed across Nightingale Lane, Wapping, partly in the Limehouse District, and partly in the Whitechapel District, by the London and St. Katharine Docks Company, to connect the warehouses in the London Docks with the warehouses in the St. Katherine Docks, upon terms sanctioned by the said Boards respectively. The exterior and interior of the Board's Offices were thoroughly repaired and decorated under two contracts. The Board having determined to plant Trees in the Burdett Road, tenders were received for the same, and a contract entered into for the supply and planting of Trees in that throughfare, from the Bridge over the Lea Cut, to the St. Paul's Road. The Trees have been planted with proper guards, &c., and the sum of £100 has been received from John Noble, Esq., towards the expense. LONDON & BLACKWALL RAILWAY, (LIMEHOUSE CURVE.) The Works authorised by the London and Blackwall Railway Act, 1877, have been commenced, and are being carried out by the Company, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. IMPROVEMENTS. The New Bridges over the Hermitage and Wapping entrances of the London Docks, having been completed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the same are opened for traffic; thus completing the Wapping Improvement authorised by the Metropolis Streets Act, 1872. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill.—This Bill was passed into an Act, and provides that the Metropolitan Board of Works shall have jurisdiction over all flood works which are to be executed from time to time by the several bodies and persons liable under the directions and to the satisfaction of that Board. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board. to the BOARD OF WORKS for the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit to you my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of the Limehouse District for the year 1879. During the year there were registered in the District 2,286 births, and 1,405 deaths. From the latter number there must be deducted 101, the number of deaths of non-residents, which occurred in the East London Hospital for Children, and to the result (1,304) must be added 250, the number of deaths of persons who though ordinarily resident in the District died in Public Institutions outside its boundaries. The result of this addition, 1,554, represents the total mortality in your District during the year 1879; and it is upon that number that the calculations and tables in the following pages, except when otherwise stated, are based. 2 The birth rate for the year was 38 per 1,000, and the death rate 25.9 per 1,000. The birth rate of the Metropolis for the same period was 36.5 per 1,000, and the death rate 23.3 per 1,000. Both births and deaths were above the averages of the last ten years, the former by 179, the latter by 186. There were 505 marriages registered, which number was 68 below the last decennial average. The birth rate (38 per 1,000) exceeded the average of the last ten years by 2.7 per 1,000. The death rate (25.9 per 1,000) exceeded the average of the last ten years by 2.9 per 1,000. The nearest approach to it was in 1875, whent it was 25.8 per 1,000. The death rate of the Eastern group of Districts during the last ten years averaged 25.2 per 1,000. The deaths of children under 1 year constituted 25 per cent of the total mortality, the last decennial average having been 26.9— they were therefore 1.9 below that average. The per centage of deaths of children under 1 year to registered births was 17, the average of the last ten years having been 17.3. The deaths of children under 5 years of age constituted 45.7 per cent. of the total mortality, which, though 3.6 per cent. below the decennial average, was .7 per cent. above the number of deaths registered among the same class in 1878. Compared with that year there has been a decrease of 45 in the number of deaths from certain of the Zymotic diseases taken as a class, an increase of 70 3 in the number of deaths from pulmonary diseases other than Phthisis, an increase of 13 in the number of deaths from Tubercular diseases, a decrease of 1 in the number of deaths from Wasting diseases, and an increase of 10 in the number of deaths from Convulsive diseases. You will perceive, therefore, that in the abovenamed classes of disease there has been a net increase in the number of deaths amounting to 47—the principal increase has been in the deaths from Pulmonary diseases other than Phthisis; and by referring to Table 3 you will find that this class has received its greatest accession from the ranks of children under 5 years of age. Two hundred and forty deaths were registered from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, viz :—Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea—they were fatal to 4 persons per 1,000 of the population, and of every 1,000 deaths 154 were due to them Three hundred and sixty five deaths occurred from Pulmonary diseases other than Phthisis—they were fatal to six persons per 1,000 of the population, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 234 were due to them. One hundred and seventy nine deaths were due to Tubercular diseases, viz. :—Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Tabes—they were fatal to 3 per 1,000 of the population, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 115 were due to them. 4 One hundred and thirty deaths occurred from the Wasting Diseases of Infants—two of every 1,000 of the population died of them, and of every 1,000 deaths registered 83 were due to such diseases. The Convulsive Diseases of Infants caused 118 deaths—they were fatal to 1.9 per 1,000 of the population, and 76 of every 1,000 deaths registered were due to them. Having thus glanced at certain classes of disease, I now proceed to examine the general Mortality of the District, and to analyse more closely those causes of death which I have hitherto considered only in groups. Zymotic Diseases caused the deaths of 272 persons, of which number 213 were below the age of 5 years. Only one death was registered in the District from Small Pox; the death of a resident in the District occurred in one of the Small Pox Hospitals, and these two are the only deaths from this disease of which I have any record. The average annual number of deaths from Small Pox in your District for the last ten years was 35 ; but you must not suppose that that number, or anything like it, occurred in each year. In the year 1871, 110 deaths were registered; in 1872, 8 ; in 1873, 3; in 1874 and 1875 none; in 1876, 13 ; in 1877, 89 ; and in 1878, 63. From these figures you will perceive that the mortality from Small Pox in your District was lower than it had been since 1875. The recently published experience of the Medical Officers 5 of the Small Pox Hospitals should leave no doubt that efficient vaccination in infancy, and re-vaccination at, or about, puberty, are the remedies to be employed against the occurrence of this disease. Measles caused 49 deaths during the year, the annual average of the last ten years having been 36.8. Scarlet Fever caused 71 deaths, the annual average of the last ten years having been 48.3. The largest number of deaths from this disease occurred in 1869, when 152 were registered; the smallest in 1878, when 16 occurred. You must not think that this statement contradicts what I have already said of the decrease in the number of deaths from Zymotic diseases—I was then dealing with them as a class, I am now considering them individually. Diphtheria caused 11 deaths, the annual average of the last ten years having been 4.6. Whooping Cough caused 43 deaths, the average of the last ten years having been 56.7. The practice that prevails of carrying children, suffering from this disease, in the streets and public conveyances, and the taking of such children to the waiting rooms of Hospitals devoted to the treatment of children's diseases, is, in my opinion, a very frequent means of communicating the affection, and is much to be deprecated. Eighteen deaths were registered from Fever, of which number 2 were due to Typhus, 13 to Enteric, and 3 to Simple Continued Fever. The number of deaths coincide 6 almost exactly with the annual average of the last ten years. Forty four deaths were registered from Diarrhoea, the annual average of the last ten years having been 67. These deaths were mostly among children; and I attribute the comparatively low number to the cold weather experienced during the summer months of last year, a period when this disease is generally most prevalent. Constitutional Diseases caused tho deaths of 209 persons, of whom ninety were under 5 years of age. Fourteen deaths were due to Cancer, eight to Scrofula, fifty nine to Tabes Mesenterica, one hundred and twelve to Phthisis, and fourteen to Hydrocephalus. Local Diseases were fatal to 610 persons, of whom 293 were under 5 years of age. Forty four deaths were registered from Cephalitis, thirty from Apoplexy, six from Paralysis, fifty seven from Convulsions, forty four from Heart Disease, six from Laryngitis, two hundred and thirty nine from Bronchitis, one hundred and ten from Pneumonia, seven from Asthma, nine from Lung disease, twelve from Stomach disease, ten from Liver disease, and five from Bright's disease of the Kidneys. Compared with the year 1878, there was a large increase in the number of deaths from diseases of tho Respiratory Organs—this is attributable, in my opinion, to the low temperature and wet weather which prevailed throughout a considerable portion of the year. Devolepmental Diseases caused the deaths of 141 persons, of whom 96 were under 5 years of age; twenty eight were due to Debility from Premature Birth, twenty to Teething, forty three 7 to Atrophy, while forty deaths were registered from Old Age, of which number nine occurred above the age of 85 years. Violent Deaths terminated the existence of 70 persons; thirteen died from Fractures or Contusions, three from Burns or Scalds, thirty from Drowning, seventeen from Suffocation, and five committed Suicide. Compared with the preceding year, I find that in 1879 the deaths from Zymotic diseases were 16 less ; from Constitutional diseases 4 more ; from Local diseases 84 more ; from diseases of Development 11 more ; and from Violence 7 less. Sanitary Work, &c. With regard to the routine, Sanitary Inspection, which is always going on, I have to report that in the period under consideration 1,411 houses were inspected, and the orders issued for Sanitary amendments amounted to 1,070. Two hundred and one houses were cleansed, repaired, and whitewashed; and 156 were disinfected after infectious diseases. One hundred and eighty three house drains were repaired and cleansed, and 218 trapped. One hundred and four privies and water closets were repaired and cleansed, 5 were supplied with water, and 4 new were provided. Sixty one new dust bins were erected, and 76 covered and repaired ; ten new cisterns were provided, and 62 were repaired, cleansed, and covered. The yards of 295 houses were paved or re-paved. With regard to infectious diseases all practicable disinfection was carried 8 out with the least possible delay—the removal of the the infected to Hospital was urged most strongly, and in the majority of cases successfully. Most of these removals were effected by the Officers of the Board of Guardians for the Stepney Union; but in those instances where the social condition was manifestly above that of pauperism, the removal was carried out by your Sanitary Officers; the infected houses and rooms were disinfected in the usual manner, the bedding, clothing, &c., by heat in the apparatus belonging to the Board; the drains were flushed with disinfectants, the dust bins emptied, and notices were served upon the landlords of the property to cleanse the same. The Inspectors performed their duties promptly, cheerfully, and to my entire satisfaction. Certain localities in your District were the subjects of special reports by me to your Board on account of their bad Sanitary condition. Among these places I may enumerate Ann's Place, Chausan Place, Jamaica Place, Five Bell Alley, Duke Shore Alley, and Railway Place, Limehouse ; Elizabeth Court, and Stepney Causeway Court, Ratcliff; and Chancery Court, Chancery Place, and Angel Court, Shadwell. In these localities the improvements I suggested, which consisted principally in better latrine accommodation were, by the direction of your Board, carried out. The Canal Boats' Act having come into force on the 1st January, I made arrangements whereby all canal boats entering your waters should be reported to me. Twenty nine boats were so reported, of 9 which number only five were unregistered—these were made the subjects of communication between your Board and their Owners; and, I believe, were subsequently registered. No boat was registered by your Board, and only one application for registration was made, but as the boat for which the certificate was required was considerably outside the boundaries of your District the Owner was informed that he must cause it to be brought into your waters—the boat was subsequently registered at Paddington. The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, was amended by the addition of provision for compensation and re-building. Your previous experience of the working of this Act was not satisfactory. It remains to be seen, when occasion requires, what can be done with it in its amended form. The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Improvement Act, 1875, was also amended with regard to the assessment of compensation, and the provision of accommodation for the working classes. There can be no doubt that the speedy working of this Act was seriously retarded by clause 5, which provided among other things that an improvement scheme of a local authority shall provide for the accommodation of at least as many persons of the working classes as may be displaced in the area with respect to which the scheme is proposed, in suitable dwellings, which, unless there are special reasons to the contrary, shall be situate within the limits of the same area, or in the vicinity thereof. 10 In consequence of this provision great difficulties were experienced in disposing of the sites at a price commensurate with their cost. They were, however, as you are aware, ultimately sold, at a sum much below their cost, and the ratepayers had to bear the loss. It was to remedy this state of things that the Act was amended. It is now provided that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the confirming authority on an application to authorize or modify an improvement scheme that equally convenient accommodation can be provided for any persons of the working classes displaced by an improvement scheme at some place other than within the area, or the immediate vicinity of the area comprised in the improvement scheme, and it is also proved to the satisfaction of such authority that the required accommodation has been, or is about to be forthwith provided; it shall be lawful for the confirming authority accordingly to authorize any such improvement scheme, or to permit a modification of any such scheme; and the requirements of the principal Act with respect to providing accommodation for persons of the working classes shall, to the extent to which accommodation is provided in accordance with this section, be deemed to have been complied with. The Poor Law Amendment Act also passed, and is interesting to your Board, inasmuch as you were mainly instrumental in having caused the insertion in the Bill of a clause empowering the Metropolitan Asylums' District Board to contract with a Sanitary Authority for the reception and treatment of non-pauper infectious 11 sick, power being reserved, to such Authority, to recover the expense of said treatment. The Metropolitan Board of Works having been constituted the Local Authority for the Regulation of the Cow and Slaughter Houses, issued bye-laws for the guidance of the owners of such structures, which came into effect last year. These premises were inspected by me, and the licenses granted by the Magistrates to such as had complied with the said bye-laws. For a list of these premises, with the names of their proprietors, I beg to refer you to Table VIII. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Seventy-nine samples of articles of food, drink, and drugs, Were examined, viz., 22 of Milk, 9 of Flour, 12 of Bread, 6 of Pepper, 2 of Arrowroot, 4 of Butter, 3 of Vinegar, 6 of Tea, 6 of Coffee, 2 of Mustard, 1 of Iodide of Potassium, 3 of Quinine, and 1 of Rhubarb. Of the Milks 4 were adulterated with water, varying in quantity from 20 to 45 per cent. Of the Breads 2 were adulterated with alum. Of the Quinines one consisted almost entirely of cinchonine. All the other samples were genuine. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. A. ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health, Board of Works Office, July, 1880. and Food Analyst. 12 TABLE I.
