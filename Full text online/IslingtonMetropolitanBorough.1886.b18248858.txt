The death-rate of Islington during the past year has been 157 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a total of 5,159 deaths recorded in the Parish, of which 2,602 were males, and 2,557 females. Of the 5,159 total deaths registered in Islington, 1,599 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1,739 in Islington South West, 1,051 in Islington South East, and 770 in Highbury. The actual number of deaths this year is rather less than the total number of the previous year, and taking the increase of the population into account, the death-rate of 15.7 per 1,000 is the lowest to be found upon our Islington records. It is noteworthy that this exceptionally low death-rate again occurs in conjunction with an exceptionally low birth-rate. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to age the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1882 to 1886, inclusive:— 1882. 1883. 1884. 1885. 1886.

No death from Small-Pox actually occurred in the Parish during the year. The number of deaths referred to Measles, fell from 289 in 1885 to 64 in 1886, and those referred to Diphtheria decreased from 138 in 1885 to 54 in 1886. The number of deaths attributable to diseases of the Respiratory Organs was again high, as in the previous year, the fatal cases numbering 1,201 in 1886, 1,197 in 1885 and 978 in 1884. The deaths from Diarrhoea were greatly in excess, having risen from 191 in 1885 to 307 in 1886, being the greatest number on record during the corresponding period in any previous year. SMALL POX. Small-pox which had ceased to be epidemic in September, 1885, was scarcely seen amongst us during 1886, twelve cases of sickness only having been recorded during the first seven months, not a single case being heard of during the last five months of the year, and up to the present time no case of sickness has come to our knowledge during the current year. Of the 12 cases, two were fatal after their removal to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board. For more than twelve months therefore we have shared with the whole of the Metropolis comparative immunity from this disease, only 22 deaths from Small-Pox having occurred of London residents during the year, including those who died in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals outside Registration London. Such quietude, however, is no promise of a prolonged absence of Small-Pox from our midst, for this sign of peace, this unusual freedom from so dire a disease may be, and probably is, as on former occasions only the precursor of the rising wave, which may break unexpectedly upon us at any moment. 10 It is in circumstances like these that we should beware lest we allow ourselves to be lulled into false security, but should rather be stimulated to greater activity in making good our walls and defences to keep out the tide, and by dint of cleanliness and sound sanitation, and other necessary precautions, as well as by good protective vaccination and by re-vaccination, we should endeavour to keep our outworks in such a state of preparedness as to resist the encroachments of the enemy on the first signs of its formidable approach. Unfortunately the very reverse is too generally the case, for in the absence of Small-Pox the possibility of the scourge itself returning is often forgotten, and the commonest safeguards are neglected. People, moreover, persuade themselves, or are persuaded, that vaccination is of little consequence, or that it is even an evil and unnecessary thing. They forget that by the very law of Small-Pox it appears as though we must be either actively preparing to resist attack or stolidly standing still while nature breaks up the fallow ground so as to have in readiness a fruitful soil fully capable of receiving and vitalising the fatal seed. For is it not true that while some may be quietly enjoying a fancied freedom from danger, there are classes of the community, and more especially those who are living under conditions the least favourable to health, who are gradually but certainly, by growth and by other constitutional changes, acquiring a greater receptivity for this much dreaded malady, and are thus becoming the probable victims of a future outbreak and the means by which the disease will be propagated and intensified. I again sound this note of warning and of preparation, deprecating as I do most strongly the least neglect, believing that it is true wisdom always to be in readiness for the evil day, not as though it was very far off, but as if we were standing in the very presence of an enemy warily watching our every movement, and determined to attack us on the least signs of wavering and unsteadiness in the ranks. 11 Measles caused only 64 deaths, pretty generally distributed over the twelve months, as against 289 in 1885, and 125, 1G5, 153, 161, 48 and 219 in the six previous years. This disease has however shown much greater activity during the present year, 258 fatal cases having already occurred during the four months from the 1st March to the end of June. It is, in fact, the most active epidemic of the current year, and the most fatal. Whooping Cough was again prevalent as an epidemic amongst us, causing 205 deaths as against 200 in 1885, and 268, 119, 299, 172 and 299 in the nve previous years. As is generally the case, the first four months of the year contributed the greatest proportion of deaths, or about 70 per cent. of the whole number. Diarrhoea occasioned 307 deaths, the highest number yet reached, as against 266, 162, 149, 216, and 295 in the five previous years. As would be expected the months of July, August and September contributed the largest number of the deaths, being equal to 86 per cent. of the whole mortality. Fever.—The deaths attributable to Fever generally were 48 as against 55, 83, 86, 77 and 79 in the five previous years. Diphtheria, as I anticipated in my last report, has been much less active during the year, having occasioned only 54 deaths, as against 138 in 1885, when the epidemic culminated in the fifth year of its course. The fatal cases were more generally distributed over the parish than in former years, but the Eastern portions were again the districts where the deaths from Diphtheria mostly occurred, and where Scarlatina was to all appearance the least prevalent. This epidemic may be said to have commenced in 1881, when the deaths rose from 27 in the previous year to 42, the numbers in the succeeding years being 54 in 1882, 70 in 1883, 114 in 1884, 138 in 1885, and then falling in 1886 to 54. The monthly deaths in the present year also show still further decreasing numbers. 12 Scarlatina was once more singularly absent as an epidemic from our district, 25 deaths only being referable to this disease during the year. The next lowest number was 29 in the previous year, the highest having been 465 in 1870. During the last five years the deaths have been gradually declining from 142 in 1882 to 95, 57, 29 and 25 in 1886, whilst in the corresponding years the deaths from Diphtheria have been successively 54, 70, 114, 138 and 54. The distinction between Scarlatina and Diphtheria was either unrecognised or unacknowledged before the year 1859, when for the first time the deaths from these diseases were separately registered. At that time, from the result of the observations made by my predecessor, Dr. Ballard, and by others in connection with the cases of Diphtheria which occurred both in 1858 and 1859, there were no doubt excellent reasons for making a distinction in the classification of these diseases, and the necessity for this may still be fairly admitted to exist. The careful diagnosis, however, of the first investigators in respect to this disease, who noted and stamped its specific characteristics as distinguished from Scarlatina, has been gradually much widened if not altogether departed from, with the curious but apparent result that in the course of years the proportional fatality of Scarlatina and Diphtheria has altogether changed, for whereas in the first year, 1859, and for two decenniads afterwards, the deaths from Scarlatina were, with slight variations, several times in excess of those attributable to Diphtheria, the proportional relationship (more especially since the death of the Princess Alice) has been constantly diminishing until it is now altogether reversed, and the deaths from Diphtheria in London generally exceeded those referred to Scarlet Fever during the years 1885 and 1886, whilst in Islington the deaths from Diphtheria in 1884 and 1886 were twice as many as from Scarlatina and in 1885 they were very nearly five times as numerous. With these facts in view, the following Table, having reference to 13 Islington and also to the whole of Registration London, may prove interesting:— Table showing the relative number of deaths from Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria in Islington and in Registration London since 1859, when these Diseases were first separately enumerated and tabled.

During the twelve months ending December, 1886, I examined 113 samples of food, 112 of which were submitted by your Inspectors, and one sample of Flour was submitted to me by the Islington Guardians. This makes in all 1,576 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 112 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of:— 56 Milk. 14 Green Tea. 14 Coffee. 14 Sugar. 14 Mustard. Of the 112 samples submitted to me for examination by your Inspectors, I certified 5 samples of Milk to be adulterated and the Vendors were prosecuted accordingly. The result of the summonses will be found elsewhere, but beyond these 5 samples of Milk I had no occasion to find fault with the quality of the articles submitted for analysis. The sample of Flour submitted to me by the Guardians I certified to be genuine. I have again, in an Appendix attached hereto, published, in extenso, for the information of the Vestry, my Reports as Analyst, together with their accompanying Schedules, and for further details I refer the reader to these reports. THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1886. From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1886, 608 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 17. 335 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £51 15s. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 6.5 per cent. for the whole year. 17 SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1886-87. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the Inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition the Inspectors generally, have also reported the premises from which they have found removal of dust to be necessary on making their ordinary inspections. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, Carbolic Acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. Disinfecting Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. The Dust Bins were also disinfected by the Dustmen after removing the Dust from the houses of the inhabitants during the hottest months of the year. THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1886-87. At the Annual Licensing of 1886 there were 77 applications for the renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, and the whole of them were granted. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 37 applications were made and the whole were granted. 77 Slaughter-houses and 37 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending 25th March, 1887, six summonses were issued by direction of the Sanitary Committee. One summons was taken out for the abatement of a nuisance arising from defective drainage, and upon an order being made by the 18 Magistrate the necessary new drainage works were, after some little delay, carried out satisfactorily, and the costs incurred, amounting to 6s. 6d., were paid in due course by the defendant. The five other summonses were taken out against the Vendors of Adulterated Milk upon certificates given by me as Public Analyst. The prosecution was successful in each of these cases, but the penalties imposed were very small. Three of the defendants were fined only 20s. each, with 2s. costs; and the other two, 10s. each, with 2s. costs. In three of the cases I certified that the samples analysed contained 12 per cent. of added water, that in the fourth sample there was 13 per cent., and in the fifth as much as 23 per cent. of added water. DWELLINGS OF THE POOR. Of the 76 Houses closed as unfit for human habitation in 1884 by order of the Magistrate 14 houses only remain closed, 7 in Elliott's Place, and 7 in Providence Place. • It is, I believe, still contemplated, notwithstanding the delay, to make such alterations and improvements in the houses in Elliott's Place as will render them when completed again suitable for habitation. In the case of Providence Place it is more than probable that several of the houses will be pulled down and the ground absorbed in the adjoining properties, three houses with their sites having already been incorporated with the premises immediately contiguous to them. REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY (29 & 30 Vic. cap. 90, sec. 35 & 37 & 38 Vic. cap. 89, sec. 47). Since the Vestry made the Regulations with respect to Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, in February, 1885, 239 Houses have been placed on the Register by the Vestry up to the 25th of March, 1887, and 48 more have been added since. 19 These 239 houses, which have therefore been brought under special inspection, have had many improvements made in them, and are generally better kept than they were, so that the Regulations have been of benefit in this respect no doubt, although it would be impracticable, in fact utterly impossible, to enforce the carrying out of the minor requirements contained in them and others which were originally suggested, unless perhaps a caretaker were appointed to live in each house, and it would even then be a difficult task. It is my firm conviction that people can never be regulated into being cleanly and obedient to the laws of health, and that Hygeia will still have to mourn over the neglect of those who might be her votaries, could model Regulations make them such, but who prefer instead to sweep and cleanse their rooms, and to open their windows for ventilation, only when it pleases thorn, and who will adhere to their own surroundings and follow their own ways and devices in spite of all invitations and inducements to follow in the paths of cleanliness, of comfort, and of health. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1886-87. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated Statement (Table No. VII) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-Day, 1887, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 11,244 applications received from residents during the year 7,609 were by letter or postal card, and 3,635 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 11,244 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 27'5 per cent. of the 40,928 assessments in the Parish. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. 30th June, 1887. TABLE No. V. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING (Deaths of Non-Residents Upper Holloway. Islington, South-West.
