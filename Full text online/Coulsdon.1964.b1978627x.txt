This is my last report after six years as your Medical Officer of Health, and during this period many improvements have taken place affecting the health of the District. Outstanding among these has been vaccination against poliomyelitis. Once again, for the fourth year in succession, no case of poliomyelitis occurred. Already this most distressing disease is beginning to become rare and will soon, I hope, become as rare as diphtheria, the last case of which occurred in 1958. The services available to the old people continue to expand and the Health Centre for the Elderly at Purley Clinic continues to be a great success. In conclusion I should like to say how happy 1 have been as your Medical Officer of Health and how much I have valued the advice, co-operation and friendship I have received at all times from the Chairmen and members of the Council. I should also like to say how much I owe to all the officers of the Council, and to thank especially Mr. Haworth, Chief Public Health Inspector, for all the help he so willingly gave me, Mr. Prothero, Chief Clerk of the Public Health Department, for his exceptionally valuable administrative advice and friendship and Mrs. Pointer, Divisional Health Visitor, for her imaginative help, especially in setting up the Health Centre for the Elderly. My thanks are also due to all the other members of the Public Health Department for their loyalty, efficiency and friendship. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. B. MORWOOD Medical Officer of Health 4 HEALTH REPORT FOR 1964 PART 1 AREA AND POPULATION The Urban District of Coulsdon and Purley was constituted by an Order of the Local Government Board dated 1st November. 1914. and came into existence on the 7th April, 1915. It has therefore been a separate District for just over 50 years. Situated on the North Downs and for the most part in the Green Belt it is a well favoured residential area. The District has an area of 11,142 acres, these being distributed among the wards as follows :— Coulsdon East 2,870 Coulsdon West 1,248 Kenley 1,261 Purley 669 Sanderstead North 701 Sanderstead South 1.448 Selsdon and Farleigh 2,075 Woodcote 870 The mid year population was 75,460 in 1964 as compared with 63,770 at the time of the 1951 census. These numbers include persons resident in institutions and schools in the District, the numbers of which at the end of 1964 were as follows Cane Hill Hospital 2,028 Netherne Hospital 1,972 Reedham School 214 Tn December, 1964 there were 21,663 occupied houses, distributed as follows:— Coulsdon East .. 3.557 Coulsdon West 3.245 Kenley 2.275 Purley 2.874 Sanderstead North 2,684 Sanderstead South 3,253 Selsdon and Farleigh 1,924 Woodcote 1.851 This gives an average of 3.48 persons per occupied house in 1964 or 3.28 if the institutional population is excluded. 5 PART 2 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 11,142 Registrar-General's estimate of population, mid 1964 75,460 Population, Census 1951 63,770 Population, Census 1961 74,738 Number of occupied houses, December, 1964 21,663 Number of occupied houses, 1951 18,071 Number of occupied houses, 1931 9,533 Rateable Value, December, 1964 £3,852,067 Sum represented by a penny rate £15,600 VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1964 M F Live births 1,123 Live-births - Legitimate. 567 497 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 14.8 Live-births - Illegitimate 25 34 Corrected 16.1 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births = 5.2.

It will be seen by reference to the preceding table that this is equal to an annual birth rate of 14.8 per 1.000 population, as compared with 14.9 in 1963. If this rate is corrected in accordance with the RegistrarGeneral's assessment of the atypical constitution of the population it becomes 161 and this is comparable with the birth rate for England and Wales which was 18.4. Illegitimacy.— In 1964 of the births registered 59 were illegitimate (25 males and 34 females), this being 10 more than in the preceding year. Stillbirths.— The number of stillbirths registered during 1964 was 14 (5 males and 9 females), this being two more than last year. The local still-birth rate was 12.3 per thousand live and still births. 7 DEATHS The number of deaths registered during 1964 as belonging to this District was 866 (391 males and 475 females), Of this total 217 deaths (74 males and 143 females) occurred in the mental hospitals. The uncorrected death rate was 11.5, but the corrected death rate which allows for the high proportion of deaths occurring in the mental hospitals was 8.9 which compares with the rate of 11.3 for England and Wales. In order that a more accurate comparison can be made, the records in respect of normal residents have been kept separate from those of mental hospital patients and a full list of the causes of deaths and the ages at which they occurred is given in Table III. The principal causes of death during 1964 are shown in the following table:— TABLE 11 Cause. Number of Deaths General Population Mental Hospitals Vascular lesions of nervous system 81 24 Heart and circulatory diseases 248 62 Pneumonia 41 40 Bronchitis 16 28 Accidents 36 5 Malignant neoplasms other than lung 96 8 Malignant neoplasm, lung 41 4 HEART AND CIRCULATORY DISEASE Among the ordinary residents the death rate from heart and circulatory disease was 4-10 compared with an average of 3-56 in the preceding five years. CANCER The number of deaths from malignant neoplasms in the general population was 137. Forty-one of these, i.e. 29% were due to cancer of the lung. MATERNAL MORTALITY Unfortunately there was one maternal death in 1964 with a resultant maternal mortality rate of 0.8 per 1,000 live and still births compared with that of 0.25 for England and Wales. 8 TABLE III DEATHS OCCURRING DURING THE YEAR 1964 CAUSE OF DEATH Sex Total All Ages Private Residents Hospital Cases Under 4 weeks 4 weeks and under 1 year AGE IN YEARS 1— 5— 15— 25— 35— 45— 55— 65— 75 and over Tuberculosis, respiratory M 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - 1 - - F 2 1 1 - - - - - - - - 1 — 1 Tuberculosis Other M - - - - - - - - - - - - - — F 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - 1 Syphilitic disease M - - - - - - - - - - - - — — F 1 1 — - - - - - - - - - - — Other infective and parasitic diseases M 2 2 - - - - - - - - - 1 - 1 F 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - Malignant neoplasm, stomach M 5 5 — - - - - - - - 1 — 4 — F 8 6 - - - - - - - - 1 — 2 5 Malignant neoplasm, lung, bronchus M 38 35 3 - - - - - - 2 4 15 10 7 F 7 6 1 - - - - - - - 1 1 1 4 Malignant neoplasm, breast M - - - - - - - - - - - - - — F 15 15 - - - - - - - 1 4 4 1 5 Malignant neoplasm, uterus. .

One of the deaths was in respect of an illegitimate child. The resultant infant mortality rate was 14.2 per 1,000 registered births, compared with an average of 15.6 for the previous five years. The infant mortality rate for England and Wales was 20.0. The 14 babies dying in the first month correspond with a neonatal rate of 12.4 (i.e. deaths in the first month per 1,000 live births) and the average for the past five years was 11.6. The 14 babies dying in the first week correspond with an early neo-natal rate of 12.4. 10 11 TABLE IV INFANT MORTALITY DURING THE YEAR 1964 Cause of Death Under I week. 1-2 weeks. 2-3 weeks. 3-4 weeks.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THEIR CONTROL The following table indicates the number of cases of infectious diseases notified during 1964 the number admitted to hospital and the number of deaths which occurred. TABLE V Disease. Numbers Notified. Admitted to Hospital. Total Deaths. Scarlet fever 35 — — Acute pneumonia 1 — — Measles 641 — — Whooping cough 38 — — Erysipelas 4 1 — Dysentery 14 — — Food poisoning 4 — — Acute poliomyelitis — — — Puerperal pyrexia 1 — - Diphtheria — — - Paratyphoid B 2 2 - Acute encephalitis — — - Meningococcal infection — — - A further analysis of these cases by ages, wards and the months during which they occurred is given in Tables XIII and XIV (see pages 23 and 24) and the number of cases of infectious disease notified since 1934 is given in Table XV (see page 25). It will be seen that tuberculosis is omitted from this list of infectious diseases, as it is dealt with separately later. SCARLET FEVER There were 35 cases of scarlet fever, five more than the number that occurred in 1963. This disease is difficult to control and it is fortunate that in recent years it has become a very much milder disease than it used to be. ACUTE PNEUMONIA During the year 1 case occurred. MEASLES 1964 was again an epidemic year for measles: 641 cases occurred compared with 859 in 1963 which was also an epidemic year. Immunisation is still not available against this disease although work is progressing on a vaccine and it remains one of the commonest diseases of childhood. 12 WHOOPING COUGH Thirty-eight cases of whooping cough were notified compared with eleven in 1963 and 2 in 1962. None was admitted to hospital. These comparitively low figures continue the low incidence of this disease since 1956, indicating the value of immunisation and the importance of immunising all young children. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,026 and 215 were given reinforcing injections. DYSENTERY Fourteen cases of dysentery of the mild Sonne type occurred. FOOD POISONING Four cases of food poisoning occurred during the year. The organism responsible was Salmonella typhimurium. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS I am pleased to report that no case of poliomyelitis occurred in the District during 1964. Since the inception of the Scheme in 1957, 49,332 persons in the South-Eastern Division of Surrey have been vaccinated against poliomyelitis. PARATYPHOID FEVER Two cases of paratyphoid fever occurred in the District during 1964. DIPHTHERIA No case of diphtheria occurred during the year but cases are still occurring in the rest of the country. The number of cases in England and Wales was 24 compared with 37 in 1963. It is therefore, as important as ever that parents should have their children immunised and arrange for reinforcing injections when they are 5 and 10 years old. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,058 and 1,801 were given reinforcing injections. PUERPERAL PYREXIA One case occurred during 1964. 13 SMALLPOX The necessity for obtaining and maintaining protection against this disease was stressed by the outbreaks that occurred in various parts of the country in 1962 and there has been a welcome increase in the number of vaccinations and revaccinations carried out since then. The number of primary vaccinations carried out was 702 and the number of re-vaccinations was 50. TETANUS Tetanus is not notifiable and its incidence is not known. Cases do occur, however, and there have been several fatal cases in Surrey during recent years. It is hoped that parents will have their children immunised against this disease as well as the other diseases of childhood. The tetanus prophylactic injection is usually a combined one with whooping cough and diphtheria prophylactics so that no extra injections are necessary. The number of children immunised against this disease was 1,119 and 907 were given reinforcing injections. 14 TUBERCULOSIS The following table presents concisely the position with regard to tuberculosis in the District during 1964.

The Council is responsible for rehousing, one of the most important measures in the prevention of this disease, and also for disinfection, but the County Council bears the responsibility for all other preventive measures except the treatment of cases which is that of the Regional Hospital Board. There are several methods of control of tuberculosis and their efficient implementation is important in view of the fact that 9 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1964, the average for the last five years being 20. Among these methods the following are especially effective : Mass X-ray. This has brought to light early cases which have been treated and rendered non-infectious in a short time. B.C.G. Vaccination of School Children. This protects the vulnerable under 25 years age group. Contacts. Tracing contacts and arranging for treatment of those found to be suffering is important in the prevention of spread of the disease. 16 BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL EXAMINATIONS Almost all the specimens requiring bacteriological examination in the interests of the public health are sent to the Public Health Laboratory, West Park Hospital, Epsom, whilst samples of water requiring chemical analysis and Food and Drug samples are submitted to the Public Analyst. During 1964 reports were received on the following specimens:— Milk, ice cream and water samples 267 Food utensils 165 Nose and throat swabs 4 Faeces 307 Miscellaneous foods 129 Sewer swabs 34 Sputum .. 7 Vaginal swab 1 17 FACTORIES ACT 1961 PART I OF THE ACT 1.

The water is softened and chlorinated and all houses in the District are provided with a direct supply which was satisfactory in quality and quantity during the year. The natural fluoride content of the water was 013 to 0-15 parts per million supplied by both companies. There are no private wells in the District with the exception of the one at Cane Hill Hospital which is used to supplement the public supply. Routine samples of the treated water in public supply were submitted quarterly for bacteriological and chemical examination. In all, 23 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and 9 samples for chemical examination with satisfactory results in each case. No samples of raw water were submitted by the department for bacteriological examination. In addition, both the Water Companies and Local Authorities sharing these public supplies provided the department with copies of reports on the samples taken by them of the treated water in public supply. Forty-six samples were taken from the supplies of the two Companies and examined for hardness by the department. All of these were satisfactory in that adequate softening had been carried out as required. The private supply at Cane Hill Hospital which is chlorinated is kept under supervision and sampled regularly by the Public Health Department of the London County Council. Copies of reports on the samples taken are submitted to the department for information. During the year the supply at Cane Hill was pumped to waste for a period of several weeks as a result of adverse reports received on bacteriological examination of the raw water. No satisfactory explanation was found and in due course the water recovered its normal quality and was put back into supply. During the year the Hospital authorities agreed to instal a chlorine residual recorder on the plant. 20 RAINFALL The rainfall registered by the automatic rain gauge installed at Alderstead Heath was 27.16 inches in 1964 an increase of 1.35 inches compared with the previous year. The monthly totals throughout the year were as follows:— inches January 0.85 February 1.30 March 3.53 April 3.97 May 2.56 June 4.09 July 1.36 August 1.77 September 0.64 October 2.40 November 2.41 December 2.28 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS There are two swimming baths in the District used by the public; one, an open.air pool at Selsdon, is owned privately and although operating primarily in conjunction with a large hotel, is made available to the general public at a charge. The second is a covered bath situated at Reedham School which is used extensively by the Divisional Education Authority for school children. Both baths are filled and replenished as and when necessary from the public supply and provided with the necessary plant for chlorination and filtration. In addition there is a teaching swimming pool at the Keston County Primary School provided for the scholars and an indoor pool at the Thomas More School, Russell Hill. The first mentioned pool is equipped with the necessary filtration and chlorination plant and as a result of representations to the school authorities, similar equipment will be available at the Thomas More pool for the 1965 season. During the year 25 samples of the water in these baths were submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination and with the exception of one sample the reports proved satisfactory. Adverse reports are thoroughly investigated and steps taken to effect a remedy. In addition regular tests are carried out by an Inspector to check the chlorine content and the Ph value of the water. 21 SEWERAGE By agreement, sewage from the district drains into the sewerage systems of the Croydon Borough Council and the West Kent Main Sewerage Board for treatment. The arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the district are reasonably adequate and it has been the Council's policy over many years to reduce still further the diminishing number of cesspools in the district. The biggest problem affecting the District under this heading in recent years has been the flooding at Purley Corner which has been remedied by the construction of a new relief sewer from Purley Corner to Warham Road, South Croydon. The new sewer appears to be operating in a satisfactory manner. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 The powers given under this Section for securing the removal of aged persons living in insanitary conditions were not utilised during 1964. Periodically border-line cases occur in which the Welfare Officers seek advice, but every endeavour is made to find a satisfactory solution without resorting to compulsory powers. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50 Under the above section, as from 5th July, 1948, the Council became responsible for the disposal of the remains of any person who dies in the District if suitable arrangements would not otherwise be made. During the year the Council were requested to deal with three cases of this type. 22 23 TABLE XIII CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR 1964 Disease. At all ages.

This will be the last of such reports relating to the Urban District as a separate unit of local government. Not unnaturally there has been considerable preoccupation with the changes to come, and it is hoped that the preparations made to integrate the service with that of the County Borough of Croydon, will result in services to the public no less efficient than hitherto. During the year the spate of legislation relating to environmental health continued unabated, and two important statutes, namely the Housing Act, 1964 and the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 came into force. With this increasing volume of work, coupled with the national shortage of fully qualified Public Health Inspectors, it was considered expedient to appoint a Technical Assistant to carry out survey work at Offices, Shops and Railway Premises in the district, under the guidance and supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. In concluding the introduction to this report, I should like to record my appreciation of the support given to me at all times by the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, the friendly co-operation of Dr. J. B. Morwood and the loyalty and most willing assistance of all my colleagues in the department at this time. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. HAWORTH, Chief Public Health Inspector 26 HOUSING The following is a summary of work carried out in respect of the sanitary condition of dwelling houses during the year. 1. Inspection of Dwelling Houses during the year 1964. (i) Total number of houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 519 (ii) Number of dwelling houses [included under subhead (i) above] which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations 1925 and 1932 7 (iii) Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation 2 (iv) Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-head) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 240 2. Remedy of Defects during the year without service of Formal Notices— Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their officers 284 3. Action under Statutory Powers during the year (a) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1957— (i) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs Nil (ii) Number of dwelling houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices (a) By owners Nil (b) By Local Authority in default of Owners Nil (b) Proceedings under the Public Health Acts— (i) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 27 (ii) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices— (a) By owners 10 (b) By Local Authority in default of Owners 50 27 (c) Proceedings under Sections 17 and 23 of the Housing Act, 1957— (i) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made 2 (ii) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders 1 (iii) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Closing Orders were made Nil (d) Proceedings under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957— (i) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were made Nil (ii) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were determined, the tenement or room having been rendered fit Nil 4.

Demolition Orders were made in each case. Houses in multiple occupation in the district do not present a very serious problem at the present time but with the continuing shortage of alternative housing accommodation, may become of increasing importance with the passage of time. Steps have been taken to require houses in the district known to the department as coming within the definition, to comply with 28 the necessary requirements of Section 15 of the Housing Act, 1961, in accordance with a standard laid down by the Council. Provision of means of escape from fire is a necessary requirement and the Fire Prevention Officer of the Surrey County Council is consulted in every case. During the year 17 Informal Notices and 21 Statutory Notices were served in respect of these matters, and at the end of the period 12 cases had been satisfactorily resolved including 3 houses where the necessary works were carried out by the Council in default. During the year a Discretionary Improvement Grant to the value of £376. 17s. 6d. was made in respect of one house at which improvement works were made to the value of £753. 15s. Od. This type of grant is limited in this district to the improvement of sub-standard type cottage property to a degree a little superior to that provided by a Standard Grant. The Council has not, so far, been prepared to extend the scope of this grant aid for the purpose of conversion or enlargement of dwellings. Standard Grants were also made in respect of the provision of Standard amenities in 9 houses to the total value of £2,611.lis. lOd. for which grants to the value of £1,247. l1s. 6d. were made. One application to cancel a Certificate of Disrepair was received during the year under the provisions of the Rent Act, 1957. DRAINAGE During the year approximately 1,950 lin. yards of soil sewer were constructed by the Council. Eighteen houses were connected to main drainage and eighteen cesspools were abolished. 29 The following is a summary of cesspool conversions carried out since 1950 — Year Pail Closets (end of year) Cesspools (end of year) Houses and other premises connected to sewer Cesspools abolished 1950 17 180 19 houses 1 other 15 1951 14 153 30 houses 2 other 28 1952 11 144 10 houses 2 other 13 1953 11 134 10 houses 12 1954 11 136 3 houses 1 other 3 1955 11 117 21 houses 1 other 21 1956 6 106 10 houses 1 other 15 1957 6 101 4 houses 1 other 10 1958 6 94 6 houses 7 1959 6 95 — 1 1960 6 90 3 houses 2 other 7 1961 5 86 5 houses 5 1962 5 82 5 houses 5 1963 5 79 3 houses 3 1964 4 65 18 houses 18 PUBLIC CLEANSING This service is administered under the direction of the Engineer and Surveyor - Mr. H. M. Collins. A weekly collection of house refuse is in operation and trade refuse is collected concurrently as part of the daily routine in the five collection areas. Disposal is carried out by means of controlled tipping at Merstham on a joint basis with the Croydon Borough Council. Cesspool contents are emptied into the sewer. Charges are made for the removal of trade refuse and for cesspool emptying. The scale of charges for cesspool emptying as from the 1st April, 1964 are as follows:— Cesspools constructed before 1st April, 1958 — Up to 12 loads in any year, lis. Od. per load. Subsequent loads 16s. 6d. per load. 30 Cesspools constructed between 1st April, 1958 and 31st March, 1959 — 16s. 6d. per load. Cesspools constructed on or after 1st April, 1959 — £1 7s. 6d. per load. Commercial Premises - All cesspools — £1 7s. 6d. per load. RIVERS AND STREAMS The only water courses in the District are those provided by the intermittent Bourne flows. These present no difficulties apart from occasional rat infestation along the banks. INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT It is the statutory duty of a Public Health Inspector to inspect and have a thorough knowledge of the sanitary circumstances of his district in order that action can be taken if necessary to abate conditions that give rise to nuisance or are prejudicial to health. Under the following headings comment is made on particular aspects of the work, concluding with a summary of the complaints received, visits made, notices served, works carried out and defects remedied during the year. Camping Sites The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, confers on Local Authorities powers for the control of caravan sites and apart from improved planning powers it provides for a system of site licensing to be administered by District Councils. Site licences in force during the year were as follows:— Address No. of Caravans Period of Licence Dean Lane Park, Dean Lane, Merstham, 160 3 years from 21.12.63. Hall & Co., Depot, Marlpit Lane, Coulsdon. 1 1 year from 10.12.63. Windmill Farm. Coulsdon Common. 2 5 years from 29.12.60. Caterham Drive, Old Coulsdon. 1 3 years from 8.8.64. Site licence conditions in all cases require a water carriage system of drainage, main water supply and fire precautions. In the case of Dean Lane Park, communal ablution and laundry facilities with a constant supply of hot and cold water are additional requirements. 31 Clean Air There has been no change in the policy of the Council regarding the formation of Smoke Control Areas. The district is not within the "Black Areas" around London as designated by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Minister has indicated that for the present he does not consider it necessary to make any general request for the submission of smoke control programmes by Councils outside "Black Areas". The Council are participating in a National Survey of Air Pollution by Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide under the auspices of The Warren Spring Laboratory, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Stations for the purpose have been set up in the district at 73 Brighton Road, Purley, and Selsdon Library. Apart from a few minor complaints no problem has arisen in connection with smoke nuisance during the year. There is little or no industrial smoke in the district. Hairdressing Establishments Byelaws are now in force in the district which provide for securing the cleanliness of premises and the instruments, towels, equipment and materials used in the premises. During the year 44 visits were made in pursuance of the byelaws. Consumer Protection Act 1961 The provisions of the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 and Regulations made thereunder have now been incorporated in the Consumer Protection Act, 1961 which empowers the Secretary of State to make Regulations in respect of any goods which he may prescribe, imposing such requirements as he may think expedient, to prevent or reduce risk of death or personal injury. The Oil Heaters Regulations 1962, which came into force in June 1962 impose requirements as to construction, design and performance of domestic space heaters, which burn paraffin oil and are not designed for use with a flue, came into operation. In October 1964, the Children's Nightdresses Regulations 1964 came into operation. These Regulations require all nightdresses coming within the scope of the Regulations to be made of a fabric which conforms to the low flammability requirements of a British Standard. As a result of a survey of shops trading in children's wear. 24 nightdresses were destroyed as failing to come within the prescribed standard. 32 The Fabrics (Misdescription) Act, 1913 The Fabrics (Misdescription) Regulations 1959 The above mentioned Regulations prescribe standards of noninflammability for textile fabrics to which is attributed the quality of non-inflammability or safety from fire or any degree of that quality. Animal Boarding Establishments Act, 1963 The above Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1964, and prohibits the keeping of a boarding establishment for animals (which in the Act means cats and dogs) except under the authority of a licence granted by the local authority. Licences are granted subject to conditions attached thereto and during the year four such licences were issued. Mines & Quarries Act, 1954 This Act requires compliance with provisions designed to prevent accidents arising through lack of proper fencing or too easy access. Routine visits are made to quarries in the district as necessary. Schools In co-operation with the Divisional Medical Officer and in the course of milk sampling, schools are visited from time to time. Shops Act 1950 The Council is the Authority responsible for enforcement of the Shops Hours of Closing and Sunday Trading Provisions of the above Act and routine surveys and inspections are carried out for this purpose. The Home Secretary is at the present time reviewing the need, if any, for further legislation on shop closing hours. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 The main provisions of the above Act came into force on the 1st August, 1964 and provide for a standard of health, welfare and safety in offices, shops and railway premises, comparable with those in the Factories Acts. At the end of the year, 489 premises were registered with this authority and as a result of survey, 145 notices had been served in respect of infringements found. Noise Abatement Act 1960 Two complaints of noise nuisance were investigated and observations carried out. Representations were made to the persons concerned with satisfactory results. 33 Disinfection and Disinfestation Disinfection is carried out when considered necessary following cases of infectious disease and otherwise on request and on payment of a small charge. Bedding and other clothing if possible is disinfected by arrangement with the Wandle Valley Hospital in a steam disinfector at the hospital. Sick rooms and other articles are disinfected by means of formaldehyde gas or spray, and library books are treated in a disinfecting chamber at the offices at 73, Brighton Road, Purley. During 1964 the following disinfections were carried out:— Free of Upon cost Payment T otal Loads of bedding, etc.3 3 Houses disinfected 3 3 Parcels of clothing 2 2 Disinfestation work is now largely confined to the more common domestic pests such as flies, ants and wasps, but as a result of numerous complaints, a determined effort was made during the year to lessen the number of feral pigeons harbouring on railway bridges and hospital buildings in the district. By means of trapping and shooting 779 pigeons were destroyed. The use of proprietary insecticides principally of the liquid variety and having a residual effect, is proving very effective in dealing with all types of insect pests. During the year 92 cases of this type of infestation were dealt with by the department.

Compared with 1963 there was an increase in the number of premises found to be infested by rats and mice. During the year the Department continued to carry out on a contract basis certain disinfestation work at agricultural premises formerly carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food. A nominal charge of 5/- is made in respect of work carried out by the Council at private dwellings but work carried out at business premises including agricultural holdings is charged at the full cost which, at the end of the year was 16/- per hour plus cost of materials. Check baiting was carried out on the sewerage system at points where small infestations had formerly occurred. Two hundred and ninety-four manholes were test baited and evidence of infestation was found in only 5. The Council has continued to undertake rodent control at local schools for the Surrey County Council on a contract basis. 38 RODENT CONTROL The following table is a tabular statement indicating the action taken in 1964.

Routine visits are made to all food premises with the object of maintaining these standards and reference to the tabular statement of works carried out will give some indication of the matters to which attention is directed. During the year 34 complaints received in respect of contaminated or unsound food were fully investigated and warning letters were sent in appropriate cases. In one case, however, relating to rodent excreta in ice-cream cones, Court proceedings were instituted and a fine of £25 was imposed with £5 5s. Od. costs. A variety of food samples, 129 in number, were submitted for bacteriological examination during the year, including synthetic cream, cream cakes, corned beef, sausages, frozen meats and vegetables, shrimps, yogurt, black pudding, liver sausage, fish sticks, fish cakes, desiccated coconut, live mussels, cracked fresh eggs, etc. The reports on these samples were generally very satisfactory. During the year 33 swabs were taken from 165 items of washed crockery and submitted for bacteriological examination. Advisory work was carried out as and when necessary based on the reports received. Further details of food samples are recorded elsewhere in this report. The register of premises coming within the scope of the Food Hygiene Regulations at present includes the following:— Confectioners 62 Butchers 34 Fishmongers (wet and dry) 13 Fishmongers (fried) 4 Bakers 19 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 38 Cafes and Restaurana 32 Grocers 77 Chemists 20 Licensed premises 36 Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Guest Houses Hotels 21 Canteens, Clubs, Halls, etc . 55 Schools .42 12 shops other than butchers and one baker's premises are registered for the preparation of preserved meat, etc., and all the fish friers' premises are similarly registered in respect of fish frying. 40 Milk. The Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. Apart from small quantities bottled on the farms, milk sold in the larger Urban areas is collected in the distant producing areas and transported in bulk to large processing plants situate in the consuming centres where it is pasteurised or sterilised and bottled for sale by a comparatively few large dairy companies. Residents in this district rely in the main on these sources of supply, there being only one registered dairy now operating in the Council's area. General control by the Department is exercised under the above regulations and only pasteurised, tuberculin tested or sterilised milk can be sold in the district as a result of a Special Designations Order made in 1951. 3 complaints of dirty milk bottles were passed to the Authority in whose area the milk was bottled. The entries in the register, which has to be kept, were as follows:— Distributors of Milk in the District 17 Premises registered as Dairies 1 Under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, the following licences to sell milk continued in force during the year. Dealer's Pre-packed Licences 12 Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) Licence 1 41 42 TABLE XVII TESTS REQUIRED BY THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) REGULATIONS, 1960 Designation No. Methylene Blue Phosphatase Turbidity Tubercle Bacilli Brucella Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Satisfactory U nsatisfactory Pasteurised 100 100 — 99 1 — — — T.T.

Raw Milk failed the Methylene Blue Test. One sample of pasteurised milk failed the phosphatase test but exhaustive investigation failed to reveal the cause. Eight samples of raw milk were submitted to biological examination for the presence or otherwise of Tubercle Bacilli or Brucella Abortus with satisfactory results. A total of 72 washed bottles was submitted for bacteriological examination with satisfactory results. Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 One hundred and twenty-five premises are registered for the sale of ice cream within the district and although two premises are also registered for the manufacture of this product, no manufacturing has been carried out for some years. A total of 46 samples of ice cream was examined for bacterial quality by submission to the methylene blue reduction test, and placed in the following provisional grades Grade I 35 Grade II 6 Grade III 5 Grade IV These results can be considered very satisfactory. Meat Slaughterhouses Act, 1958 Slaughter of Animals Act, 1958 Public Health {Meat) Regulations 1924-1955 There are now no slaughtering facilities within the area of the Urban District and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has accepted the Council's view that there is no future need for such facilities in the district. Meat inspection is thus restricted to supplies in retail shops which are obtained in the main from the Croydon Meat Market and Smithfield. There are 34 butchers' shops in the District, all registered for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved meat under the provisions of Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955. Unsound Food 43 Food and Drugs Analysis During the year a total of 154 samples of food and drugs including 28 milk samples were purchased for the purpose of analysis by the Public Analyst. Adverse reports were received on 7 samples, two of which Bartlett Pears in heavy syrup and Select Strawberries in Syrup, were reported upon as deficient in syrup density. In the first mentioned case discussions were continuing at the end of the year and in the second the canners could give no explanation of what was thought to be an isolated instance. The matter was being kept under observation. Labelling offences were reported in respect of samples of Lemonade Powder, Concentrated Orange Juice and Claret Consomme. The first named product was taken off the market and steps were taken to amend the labels in respect of the Orange Juice and Consomme. A sample of Instant Welsh Rarebit reported as containing an excess of rusk was investigated, and the product withdrawn from the market, and finally doubt was expressed as to the claims made for Nat Mur (Sodium Chloride) but the matter was not pursued. 44 The following is a list of foodstuffs which after inspection were classified as unfit for human consumption and destroyed at the Council's refuse destructor at Kenley. tons cwts. lbs.
