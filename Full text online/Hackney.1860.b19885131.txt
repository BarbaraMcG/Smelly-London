HAC40 REPORT ON THE SANITARY STATE or HACKNEY DISTRICT, For the Quarter ending March 31, 1860. BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D, Medical Officer of Health to the District, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Ed., Vice-President of the Meteorological Society, &c., Printed by Order of the Board. C. Potter, Printer, Kingaland.—1860. REPORT To the Board of Works of the Hackney District. Gentlemen, During this Quarter the mortality for the whole of London has been in excess of the average in all the weeks but two, and I am sorry to say that Hackney has participated in the increase. This however was to have been expected, as the excessive Mortality was caused by a very rapid and continued depression of temperature which began at the end of January; for I have on several occasions shewn that Hackney, from its elevated position, suffers in more than the usual proportion, from the fatal effects of great atmospheric vicissitudes. The temperature was nearly 7½ degrees above the average in the week ending January 7; 2½, 3½, and 4½ degrees above it during the succeeding weeks, after which the temperature suddenly fell, so that the mean of the weeks during the rest of the quarter was less than usual, with but three exceptions; in 17 days having been more than 5 degrees, and on 2 days more than 10 degrees below the average. I append a table shewing the close correspondence between the vicissitudes of the weather and the mortality during the quarter. Week ending death. temp. Week ending death. temp.

We perceive that the deaths increased very greatly when the cold weather set in, but that they diminished after it had become settled, then increased again as the mean temperature of the week increased, and the vicissitudes of temperature became greater. The effect of cold weather also does not terminate immediately, as may be seen by this table. I take this 3 opportunity of enforcing the necessity of clothing young children warmly during cold weather; of using long and warm dresses, and not short scanty ones, which although they look smart, are the cause of many deaths. Newly-born children should also be most carefully protected; the air of the room in which they live should not be allowed to cool down too much at night. Similar precautions should be adopted as regards the very old, as they are almost equally obnoxious to low temperatures. I place the mortalities of the quarters ending October 1, December 31. 1859, March 31, 1860, against one-another, by which you will see tha immense mortality of the young which is induced by extreme heat and extreme cold, and the care that consequently should be taken of them at those periods when either one or the other prevails. Under 1 year. Between 1 & 20 Between 20 & 40. Between 40 & 60. Between 60 & 80. Above 80 & 90. 3rd quar., 1859. 121 88 83 54 82 28 4 „ „ do. 63 128 54 64 84 28 1 „ „ 1860. 100 110 61 67 107 36 It will be seen from the above that extreme heat is more prejudicial to infants than extreme cold, but that both are highly prejudicial, whilst to those who are above 60 years of age, extreme heat does not produce an increased death rate, whilst extreme cold is very fatal The total deaths in the District reached the unusual number of 490, of which 41 occurred in the German Hospital and East London Union, so that 449 deaths were those of the inhabitants. Of the 490 deaths, 231 were of males and 259 of females There were 673 births against 490 deaths, or at the rate of 137 births to each 100 deaths. The mortalities at the different ages were as follows: 109 deaths of children under 1 year old; 110 of persons between 1 year and 20 years; 61 between 20 and 40; 67 between 40 and 60; and no less than 36 above 80 years. The number of deaths amongst the old was very great, but they were not caused by any particular malady, but rather to have been induced by a general inability to resist disease and other prostrating causes, for the deaths were chiefly produced by paralysis, diseased heart, bronchitis, and suicide. The various diseases included under the zymotic class were not more fatal than usual, having been only 79 against 78 in the corresponding quarter of 1859, and 74 of 1858, although the total mortality was much smaller in each of these quarters. This is very satisfactory, as it is chiefly in the zymotic class of disease that sanitary measures are most effectual. The deaths from diseases of the lungs have been very large 4 during this quarter, thus in the corresponding quarters of 1857, 1858, 1859, and 1860, the numbers were (after correction for increase of population) 107, 106, 81, and 121. The number of deaths from suicide and violence was exceedingly large, no less than 20 having been registered from these causes against 8 in 1857; 11 in 1858; and 9 in 1859; of these 2 were produced by burns—the result of wearing Crinoline; 6 from hanging; 3 from scalds; 1 from poison; 2 from intemperance; 2 from privation of food; and 3 from fractures and contusions. Amongst the other groups of disease, 17 deaths resulted from maladies having an uncertain seat; 74 from tubercular dieases; 68 from affections of the brain; 18 from diseases of the abdominal organs; no less than 15 from premature birth, and debility; and 8 from atrophy. Three of those who died above 80 years old, attained the unusual ages of 91, 92, and 101, and all three were widows. One man aged 63, died from small-pox, although he was deeply marked by a prior attack. It is very extraordinary that a former attack of small-pox, does not seem at the present time to protect persons the same way as it did years ago. Whether the disease is in its essence unusually active, or whether the altered habits of life in the present generation have produced this result we cannot tell, It may, perhaps, be that persons are watched more narrowly, and that all exceptional cases are more generally known than heretofore. The number of Nuisances abated by Mr. VALENTINE have been as follows;— Cesspools emptied filled up and drained into the sewer 52 Cesspools emptied 42 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 33 Houses limewashed purified and repaired 23 Filthy places purified and cleansed 19 Pigsties repaired or removed 11 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and reconstructed 69 Other nuisances 11 260 The removal of these' Nuisances have required an unusual amount of care and labour, as they included a large number of exceptional cases. The number of persons required to attend before the board, was rather above an average, viz., 16. These persons were required to attend in consequence of neglect in carrying out the work necessary to abate the nuisances; and 6 persons were summoned to Worship Street and Clerkenwell Police Courts for continued neglect. The Magistrates ordered the requisite works to be done in all the cases. Of the 673 births, 34 were registered in Stoke Newington sub-district; 31 in Stamford Hill , 221 in West Hackney; 253 in Hackney, and 133 in South Hackney sub-district. Of the 490 deaths, 27 were 5 registered in Stoke Newington sub-district; 28 in Stamford Hill; 135 in West Hackney; 221 in Hackney, and 79 in South Hackney subdistrict. The barometer readings have varied enormously during the present quarter, and the weather has been at times most tempestuous. At Greenwich the pressure of the wind on one day was as high as 171bs., on another 281bs. on a square foot. On several occasions the wind travelled above 500 miles in a day; on one occasion it travelled more than 600, and on another above 800 miles in the 24 hours, or at an average rate of 34 miles per hour in the latter instance.

TRIPE, M.D., Medical officer of health to the district, licentiate of the royal college of physicians, ed., vice-president of the british meteorological society, etc., Printed by Order of the Board, by CHARLES POTTER, KINGSLAND, 1860. REPORT To the Board for Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, The Registrar General of births, deaths, and marriages in his Report just published for this quarter states, that "the deaths registered "in the three months that ended June 30th were 110,878, a larger num"her than was returned in any previous Juno quarter (1848—59). "The extent to which life was invaded and destroyed by causes that "have been described, badness of weather and dearness of food, can "only be partially discovered by comparing the mortality with an "average derived from seasons both healthy and unhealthy; but it may "be stated that the annual rate of mortality last quarter was 2.228 per "bent of the population." The rate of mortality amongst the inhabitants of cities was 2.305 per cent per annum, and of rural districts 2.155. The contrast between the mortality of the whole of England, and for the Hackney District during this quarter, or even between Hackney District and the Rural Districts, is singularly in favour of Hackney. As above stated, the mortality per cent per annum of the whole of England was 2.228, of Cities 2.305, of Rural Districts 2.155, whilst in Hackney it was only 1.030, or 1 death to each 61.1 persons residing within the District. I calculate that the population of Hackney and Stoke Newington has increased at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, since 1851, and this calculation is supported by the return of inhabited 3 houses which has lately been made to this Hoard. If this ho correct we may assume the population ill the middle of the quarter to have been about 80,120 persons. This groat reduction in the rate of mortality has partly been the result of the unusually high rate of death during the preceding quarter, especially amongst the weakly and aged inhabitants. The total number of deaths registered was 362, of which 34 happened in the German Hospital and East London Union. There wore also 4 deaths of young men on one day from drowning in the River Lea. Two widows died at the advanced ages of 00 and 92 respectively. The 362 deaths which wore registered in the District consisted singularly enough of an equal number of males and females, viz,., 181 of either sex. There wore 055 births against the 362 deaths, or in the proportion of 181 births against 100 deaths, which is much larger than for the whole of London. The number of births in each of the sub-districts was as follows: 37 in Stoke Newington; 31 in Stamford Hill; 190 in West Hackney; 253 in Hackney, and 141 in South Hackney. The deaths in these subdistricts were, 17 in Stoke Newington; 21 in Stamford Hill; 91 in West Hackney; 167 in Hackney, and 66 in South Hackney. The ages at death varied but little from the averages: 66 or 18.2 per cent happened in children under 1 year of age; 92 or 25.4 of those who were above 1 year old but under 20 years old; 48 or 13.3 per cent. between 20 and 40; 42 or 11.6 per cent. between 40 and 60; 90 or 24.9 per cent. above 60 and under 80; 24 or 6.0 per cent. above 80 years old. The greatest reduction in the mortality has occurred amongst the epidemic diseases, as 46 only were registered from these causes. There were 16 deaths from diseases having an uncertain seat; 60 from tubucular affections; 57 from affections of the nervous system; 29 from diseases of the heart; 59 from disease of the respiratory orgafls; 14 from abdominal maladies; 4 from diseases of the kidney, Ac.; 13 from premature birth and debility; no less than 36 from old age, which are far more than usual; and 18 from suicide, violence, or accident; 7 having been caused by drowning; 6 from the suffocation of young children in bed, and 1 from hanging. 4 I have made inspection of houses in Barnes Street, Victoria Street, Cock and Castle Lane; Camomile terrace; Chatham Place; Church Street, Hackney; Park Road; Falcon Alley; Church Street; Stoke Newington; Clarence Villas, Mortimer Road; Wilshire place, Kingsland road; Park Street; Oriel Road; Meadow Street; Mortimer Place; Nursery Place; Chapel Road; Margaret Street; Harriet Cottages; Gresham Terrace; Ebenezer Place; Oak Place; Greenwood Row, John Street, Hackney; and High Hill Ferry; also of dust yards; laystalls, and cow-houses and premises, on which trades evolving unpleasant smells are carried on. The reports on these localities having been laid before the Board in my weekly minutes, need not be recapitulated. In consequence of these visitations, 31 owaers of property, who had neglected to comply with the notices requesting them to abate the nuisances, were required to attend before the Board. The nuisances abated by Mr. Valentine during the past quarter are as follows Cesspools emptied filled up and drained into the sewer 139 Cesspools emptied 28 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 60 Houses limewashed purified and repaired 28 Pigsties repaired or removed 13 Foul and offensive drains cleansed and reconstructed 44 Other nuisances 11 323 The number of persons required to attend before the Board was far larger than usual, and the difficulty in obtaining the removal of the nuisances consequently unusually great, for this step is not taken until other means have failed. I cannot conclude this summary of the nuisances removed, without again pointing out the diminution in the deaths from fever, 9 only having been registered during this quarter. There is no doubt that privations of all kinds; bad ventilation, and mental drepression conduce to attacks of typhus and other fevers, but it is equally certain that imperfect sewerage and overcrowding exercise the most prejudicial influence of all. The weather during the quarter has been most singular, having been characterised by a low barometrical pressure, low temperature and a 5 very large amount of rain. In the month of April the mean temperature was nearly 4° below the average, in May it was about 1° above the average, whilst in June it was no less than 4%° below the average. The highest temperature recorded at Hackney, was noted in May, viz., 75°.6. The rain fall has not been so great as at Greenwich, but was very greatly above the average; at Greenwich it amounted to 10.7° 'inches, at Hackney to 9°.9 inches. This difference was caused chiefly by the less amount registered in June, when 5.1 inch fell in Hackney against 5.8 at Greenwich. This amount however was nothing like so large as in many other places, 9 inches having fallen at Southampton, 8.9 inches at Petersfield, 7.4 inches at Truro, and 6.2 inches at St. John's Wood, whilst only 3.0 inches fell at North Shields, 2.9 inches at Carlisle, and 1.8 inches at Scarborough. There has also been a most unusual amount of wind, on several occasions a pressure of above 201bs. to the square foot having been noted. The oscillations of the mercury in the barometer were also unusually great. Mr. Glaisher states that a thermometer placed on the grass indicated night temperature below 30° in no less than 15 nights, and of 30° to 40° on 35 other nights, so that during one-third of the quarter, the night temperature of the grass descended as low as 40°. On the 27th, 28th, and 29th of May, snow fell in several parts of the country. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN W. TKIPE.

Gentlemen, During this Quarter I have made numerous inspections and house to house visitations in various parts of the district, including amongst others, the following localities: Needham terrace, Clarence road; Swiss cottages, and Grove street, South Hackney; Two separate visitations in Sheep lane; Bridge street, Homerton; Urban place; Margaret street, Well street; Mount Pleasant lane; William street, Kingsland; Two visitations in Cock and Castle lane; De Beauvoir terrace; Baxter's court; Queen's court, Well street; Grove passage; Barker's cottages; Dorset cottages; Medina villas, Dalston; Manor place, Shacklewell; Robinson's row, Kingaland; Conduit place and court; Frederick place; Hertford road; Kingsland green; Shore road; College street; Bohemia place; High street, Homerton; Tiugey's buildings; Navarino terrace; Prospect place, Back road; Matthias street; Abbott street; Caledonia place; Shacklewell lane; Jerusalem gardens; Duncan road; Elm terrace, Cambridge heath; Brunswick street; Wick road; Baine's buildings; Nursery row and Stapleton's buildings; Newington common; Pleasant row, Union street; Church street, Stoke Newington; James place, Shacklewell; Nelson terrace, Stoke Newington road; Paragon road, Church street. In addition to the above, I inspected 63 slaughter houses scattered all over the district; and have made numberous visits to Winn's dust yard, Knifton's laystall, and other similar places. To all these 1 was accompanied by Mr. Valentine. The Mortality during the last quarter in London was 15197 against 15884 during the corresponding period in 1859, whilst in Hackney there were only 382 deaths against 421 in 1859, or a reduction of more than 10 per cent. after allowing for increase of population. This is an exceedingly favorable return for Hackney, especially considering the great severity of the weather during the latter part of the quarter, for as I have on several occasions pointed out, this district suffers to a very great extent from a low temperature. 3 The number of births as compared with the deaths was very large, viz.: 638 against 382, or an excess of 256 births. The rate of births was 167 to each 100 deaths Of the 638 births 338 were male and 300 female children; and of the 382 deaths 184 were of males and 198 of females. The births were registered in the various sub-districts as follows:—43 in Stoke Newington, 37 in Stamford hill, 197 in West Hackney, 248 in Hackney, and 113 in South Hackney. The 382 deaths were registered as follows: 29 in Stoke Newington, 19 in Stamford Hill, 102 in West Hackney, 165 in Hackney, 167 in South Hackney sub-districts. The largest number of deaths, 41, were registered in the 7th. week of the quarter and the smallest, 14, in the first; of the total deaths 22 occurred in the East London Union and German Hospital, so that 360 only belong to the district. The deaths from epidemic diseases of all kinds were much fewer than usual, as 78 only were registered against 94 in the corresponding quarter of 1859, and 100 in 1858. This great reduction was caused by the extremely small number of diarrhoea and fever cases registered, there being 8 cases of fever only against 22 in 1859. This is one of the best proofs of the great benefit the district has derived from the sanitary works carried out; from the great rain fall and the moderate temperature. We can scarcely expect so healthy a quarter as the last for some years, as themeteorological conditionsof the atmosphere were so conducive to health in a suburban district like Hackney. I have repeatedly stated that I consider most of the suburban districts of London to present the best possible arrangements for health, viz : a fair intermixture of town and country, where the air is neither too dry nor too moist; good sewerage and house drainage, an undulating surface of the ground, and the population, except in a few localities, not too dense. Of the remaining deaths 17 were produced by diseases having various 6eats, 59 from tubercular affections, including consumption; 46 from affections of the brain and nerves; 24 from diseases of the heart and blood vessels; 74 from diseases of the lungs; 12 from maladies of the digestive apparatus; 7 from kidney and allied complaints; 23 from old age; and no less than 22 from violence or neglect. Of these latter 7 occurred from suffocation in children under 1 year old, and 4 from drowning. I am sorry to say that deaths of young children from suffocation are much on the increase. 4 The mortality of children under I year old was decidedly leas than usual, as 69 deaths only occurred at that age out of the 382. There were 110 deaths of persona above 1 and under 20 years of age; 52 of persons above 20 but under 40 years; 54 between 40 and 60 years of age: 76 between 60 and 80: and 21 above 80 years of age. The nuisances removed by Mr. Valentine, partly from my directions, may be classed as under; Cesspools emptied filled up and drained into the sewer 42 Cesspools emptied 12 Horse, cow, pig, and vegetable refuse removed 55 Premises limewashed purified and repaired 137 Filthy places, private roads, &c., cleansed 12 Pigsties repaired and cleansed or removed 19 Foul and offensive drains cleansed or reconstructed 70 Other nuisances 1 Total 349 The temperature for the Quarter has been unusually low, occasionally, indeed, lower than almost any other authentic record. During the month of October the temperature was about I degree above the average of the last 43 years, whilst in November it was 2½, and in December 4 degrees below the average. On Christmas day the lowest temperature recorded at the Town Hall was 5½ degrees, or 26½ degrees below freezing point, and on December 29th it was 8 degrees or 24 below freezing point. The highest temperature recorded at the Town Hall, was 54½ degrees and the lowest 5½ affording a range of 49 degrees. At Hilston the range during the quarter was 23° only, at Guernsey 25°, at Truro 29°, at Ventnor 29°, at Scarbro' 30°, at St. Leonard's, Exeter, 30½o, at Fairlight 31°, and at Pembroke 31°. At Whitehall it was 40°, at Regent's Park 42½°, Greenwich 46°, Hackney 49°. In the Midland and Northern Counties the range was still greater, for at Manchester it was 56°, at York 56°. and at Nottingham no less than 60°. The influence of the sea in preventing severe cold in its immediate vicinity and was therefore unusually marked. The rainfall was very large, 7.8 inches having been registered in the vicinity of the Town Hall. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN W. TRIPE.

HAC 40 REPORT on the SANITARY STATE of HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1860, BY JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health to the District, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, E. &c., Vice-president of the British Meteorological Society, &c. Printed by Order of the Board, by john coventry, church street, hackney, 1861. Annual JUport. To the Board of Works for the Hackney District. Gentlemen, THE past year has been one of the most remarkable on record for excessive and sudden atmospheric vicissitudes, for the extreme cold, and great rain-fall. This unusual weather has not been productive of excessive mortality, but on the contrary has been coincident with an unusually small death-rate. As I have previously stated in the printed Quarterly Reports the chief sanitary improvements which have been made during the year; many of the localities and premises I have visited; also the number and causes of-death, it will be unnecessary to do more than lay before you a summary for the year. The points which I propose considering are: Firstly—the total number of births and deaths in the sub-district; Secondly—the causes of death under the chief classes or groups of diseases, especially as regards epidemics ; Thirdly—the age at death ; Fourthly—the deathrate for the whole district; Fifthly—the average duration and expectancy of life ; Sixthly—the nuisances abated; and Seventhly— the meteorology for the year. 4 TABLE I. 1860—Births in each Sob.district.

By Table No. 3, we learn, that there were only 1542 deaths registered against 2633 births, so that there were added to the population no less than 1091 persons, without allowing for new residents. To each 100 deaths there were 171 births ; whilst for the whole of London there were only 150 births to each 100 deaths. Of the 2633 births, 152 or 5.8 per cent. were registered in Stoke Newington sub.district; 130 or 5 per cent. in Stamford Hill; 837 or 31.5 per cent. in West Hackney ; 1013 or 38.6 per cent. in Hackney sub.district; and 501 or 19.1 per cent. in South Hackney sub.district. The birth.rate of the various sub-districts has varied more during this year than previously, as the following Table shows:— TABLE II. 1857.60—Birth.rate in each Sub.district. Years.

There were 64 deaths registered in the German Hospital and East London Union, which have to be eliminated from the total; and if the deaths in the Hackney Workhouse be distributed, pro raid to the population, over the whole district, the rate of mortality will be considerably altered, and we shall have the corrected numbers as follows :—103 or 7.4 per cent for Stoke Newington; 87 or 6.3 per cent. for Stamford Hill; 443 or 31.7 per cent. for West Hackney; 487 or 34.9 per cent. for Hackney ; and 274 or 19.7 for South Hackney sub.districts.

This Table shows, that for the first time since there have been records of the causes of death kept separately for this district, the ratio of deaths from epidemics has been smaller than that of deaths from pulmonary diseases. Hitherto the number of deaths from this group of diseases has been considerably in excess of any other, but during 1860 the rate was as small as l6.8 per cent, of the total mortality, in other years having been 198, 21.9, and 230 per cent, respectively. This great decrease was caused partly by the diminution of deaths from fever, but chiefly, as I shall presently show, from diarrhoea. Another remarkable feature of the Table is, that the mortality from zymotic diseases was greatest during the first instead of the third quarter as usual, which happened from the very unusual weather which then prevailed. The largest mortality from any one class of disease arose from affections of the lungs, 285 deaths or 18'5 percent, having been registered as from these causes, against 169 per cent, in 1857,162 per cent, in 1858, and 14" I per cent, in 1859. Tubercular affections, including consumption, caused precisely the same number of deaths as zymotic diseases, viz.:—259 or 16.8 per cent. Diseases of the nervous system have again produced a large number of deaths, 7 viz.:—211 or 137 per cent., of the total mortality, against 109 per cent, in 1857, 12.4 per cent, in 1858, and 14.0 per cent, in 1859. In my last Annual Report I pointed out the great increase in the mortality from these affections, arising, as I believe, partly from the present system of education, but chiefly from the mode of conducting professional and other business. The next class in order of fatality is that in which deaths from wear and tear of system and general loss of vitality (grouped together under the term old age) are placed. There is no doubt but that only a comparatively small number of the 109 deaths registered as arising from old age, really resulted from unavoidable wear and tear alone; but that on the contrary, degeneration of organs arising, to a considerable extent, from causes over which individuals have a decided control, must have been in existence to have caused death. The general tendency of propej sanitary precautions undoubtedly is to prevent many of the chronic and some of the acute diseases, which carry off mankind prematurely, and therefore it is to be expected, that the average age at death will be considerably higher than it was before the introduction of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The action of these causes is, however, not likely to be perceived in this division of the Register for many years ; indeed we find that the per centages vary very little in the different years, as 7" 1 per cent, were registered in 1860; 6.8 per cent, in 1859; 7-l per cent, in 1858; and 7-2 per cent, in 1857. Diseases of the heart were fatal to 97 persons or 6.3 per cent.; deaths from violence and accidents to 76 or 4.9 per cent. It is very much to be regretted, that deaths from these latter causes are much on the increase in the Metropolis and that Hackney has participated in that increase; for no less than 76 deaths, or nearly 5 per cent., were thus registered in 1860, against 3 per cent, in 1859; 2.4 per cent, in 1858 ; and 2.8 per cent, in 1857. This increase in deaths from violence and accidents is chiefly attributable to burns—the result of wearing crinoline; to drowning in the River Lea; and to suffocation of infants in bed. The number of deaths from the last-named cause is very much above the average, and, it is to be hoped, that some alteration in the laws will speedily be made to check for the 8 future this great and growing evil. The mortality from the four groups of disease which cause the chief mortality, viz.:—zymotic diseases, including epidemics; diseases of the nervous system, of the respiratory organs ; and tubercular affections, was 65.8 per cent, in 1860, against 67.0 per cent, in 1859, 65.4 per cent, in 1858, and 66.1 per cent, in 1857 ; so that deaths from these causes have been reduced in an equal ratio with those from all other causes. Of the 259 deaths from zymotic diseases, 228, or 14-8 per cent, of the total mortality, were caused by seven diseases, viz.:—small pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, diarrhoea, and fever. Of these scarlet fever was the most fatal, as it caused 64 deaths out of the 228, whilst measles produced 43 deaths, (a considerable increase over those of last year), and fever only 38. table vi, Hackney, 1860—Deaths from Epidemic Diseases. 1st Qr. 2ndQr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr.

The next important feature is the excessively low mortality from diarrhoea in 1860, which was a cold year, and the extremely high mortality from the same disease in 1859, which was an unusually hot year—the temperature during July, August, and September, having been nearly 4 degrees above the average. Scarlet fever also declined during 1860, and will probably cause a still less number of deaths in the present year, whilst on the contrary, measles was decidedly on the increase. It is well worthy of remark, that small pox has caused only 8 deaths during the last four years, whilst during the years 1855, 1856, there were no less than 31 deaths. I would observe in connection with this disease, that I was surprised to find, during my late inspection, how large a proportion of the children attending the public schools had been efficiently vaccinated. table viii. 1860—Ages at Death.

We perceive that during the first year of life no less than 298 children died during 1860, or 19 3 per cent, of the whole, against 18.9 per cent, in 1859, and 24.4 per cent, in 1858, and that the largest numbers died 10 during the first and last quarters of the year. That, between 1 and 20 years of age, 404 or 26.2 per cent, of the whole expired, and, as at the preceding period of life, the largest mortality-rates occurred in the first and last quarters, whilst only 201 or 13.0 per cent, died between 20 and 40 years of age. The per centages in the different years varied almost as much in the period 1 to 20 years as for the first year of life, having been 26.2 in 1860 ; 25. 1 in 1859 ; and 22.4 in 1858, while between 20 and 40 the mortuaryrates are nearly the same for the years 1858-60, having been 13-5 ; 13.5 ; and 13.0 respectively. Between the ages of 60 and 80 there died 330 persons or 21.4 per cent., and of those who were more than 80 there died 98 or 6.4 per ccnt. of the whole. The rates in 1858-60 of those between 60 and 80 were 20.1 ; 21.3 ; and 21.4 per cent., and of those above 80, 5.3; 6.7; and 6.4 per cent, of the total deaths in each year. These averages differ but little from those of former years, except as regards children under one year old, amongst whom there was a much smaller number of deaths than usual. This reduction in the mortality of young children was the result, in great measure, of the low summer temperature, and the consequent comparative absence of diarrhoea. By a reference to the Table we also ascertain that the largest mortality for the year occurred during the first quarter, 490 having been then registered against 382 in the fourth, which is a far greater disproportion than usual. The mortality in the other quarters was 382 in the fourth ; 262 in the second; and only 308 in the third, which is a most unusual occurrence. The per centages were 31.8 per cent, in the first quarter ; 23 5 in the second; only 20.0 in the third; and 24-7 per cent, in the fourth quarter. The number of deaths enumerated in Table VIII include those which occured in the East London Union and German Hospital, which, in accordance with the plan hitherto adopted I shall deduct, before calculating the average duration and the expectancy of life. The mortality in the East London Union clearly does not belong to the district; but it is questionable how far it is advisable to eliminate the deaths which take place in the last-named Institution. Considering, however, the 11 number of lunatic asylums in the district, and that the German Hospital is of comparatively recent origin, I shall adhere to the plan hitherto adopted. After deducting these deaths we ascertain that 293 deaths of infants under I year old occurred in the district, or 20.6 per cent.; 382 deaths, or 26.9 per cent., of persons above 1 year and under 20 years old ; 176 deaths, or 12.2 per cent., of persons who were more than 20 but less than 40 years of age; 189, or 13.3 per cent., of those who were above 40 but below 60 years ; 294, or 20.7 per cent., of those who had reached 60 but not 80 years of age ; whilst 89 or 6.3 per cent, died above 80 years of age. These numbers give a mean age at death of 35.12 years. During the years 1847-53 (before the Metropolis Local Management Act came into operation) the mean age at death, in Hackney, was 34.0 years. We must next calculate the rate of death amongst the total inhabitants of the district. We learn by the census return that there were 83,188 persons residing in the district on April the 1st 1861, so that there were probably 80,667 residing in it on July 1st, 1860. Taking these numbers as our data, we find that there were 100 deaths in each 5679 inhabitants, or 1 in each 56.79 residents. During the years 1847-53 the death-rate was 1 in each 51 .70 inhabitants. Now as the expectancy of life lies between the mean age at death, and the rate of death in the population, I have ascertained it to be 45 years 11 months and 16| days, which is much higher than for the whole of England. The number of nuisances removed during the year have been in excess of those abated in 1859. As usual I present them in a classified list:— Privies emptied, filled up, and drained into the Sewer 264 Privies and Cesspools emptied 115 Stable, Pig, Cow-dung, and other refuse removed 207 , Premises repaired and limewashed 182 Gulleys trapped, Roads clreansed &c 6 Pigs removed, and Pigsties repaired and cleansed 71 Choked Drains cleansed, repaired, and re-constructed 256 Other nuisances 172 Total 1267 12 Mr. Valentine informed me that there has been a far greater amount of work than usual to obtain the removal of these nuisances; and I have also paid an unusually large number of visits during the year. For a list of the chief localities I inspected, and of the house to house visitations made, I must refer to the Quarterly Reports. To obtain the removal of so many nuisances it was necessary to require the attendance before the Board of 81 owners of property, and to take out summonses against 16. The system of requiring the attendance before the Board of parties causing or allowing the continuance of nuisances, has been, therefore, as successful as usual. The weather during the past year has been most remarkable, not merely because the average temperature for the summer was much below the mean of the last 40 years, but because the rainfall was much larger than usual, and the barometric oscillations extremely great. Thus, in the month of January the highest temperature recorded at the Town Hall was 54°.8, and the lowest 27°.5, affording a range of above 27 degrees. In February, the range was greater than in January, but the highest temperature recorded was 52°.4 only, whilst the lowest was 23°. The average temperature for January was 40°.0 ; and for February only 36°.2 ; and for March 41°.4. The mean of the barometric readings was only 29.660 inches in January, the average being about 29.900 at the Town Hall. In February, 29.908 inches; in March, only 29.704 inches. The highest monthly averages were those of July and October, which were 29.912 inches and 29.908 inches respectively, whilst the lowest monthly average for the year was that for December, when the extraordinary small mean of 29.522 inches occurred. The highest temperature for the year was observed in May, viz.:—760-4, and the next highest in July, viz.:—75°-6, the next in June, viz.:—720,2, whilst in July and August, which are ordinarily the hottest months of the year, the highest temperatures recorded here were 70°.2 and 70°.6 in each month respectively. The mean temperature of July and of August was, in each month, above that of any other month of the year, because the night temperatures were higher. The mean heat for June, after allowing for the variation of temperature arising from diminished 13 elevation, was about 4½ degrees, that for July nearly 4 degrees, and that for August about 3 degrees below the mean of Greenwich for the last 89 years. The quantity of rain which fell during the year was decidedly in excess of the average. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN W. TRIPE. June 20th, 1861. Received and ordered to be printed: J.
