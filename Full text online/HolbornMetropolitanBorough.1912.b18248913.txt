REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health For the Year 1912. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. 197, HIGH HOLBORN, W.C. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn. Gentlemen, In this Annual Report for the year 1912, the various statistics of the year refer to the fifty-two weeks ended Saturday, December 30th, 1912, as adopted by the Registrar-General, and known as the Registration year. All the birth-rates and the various death-rates for the years 1901-1910 have been re-estimated on the census populations 1901 and 1911 instead of as given in previous Annual Reports for those years on the census populations 1891 and 1901. The following statistics for the years 1911 and 1912 in comparison with the previous census year 1901 indicat e the very great improvement that has taken place in the sanitary and hygienic condition of the Borough during the past decennium:— 1901. 1911. 1912. Death-rate per 1,000 20.0 15.2 1.49 Death-rate from the seven principal epidemic diseases 2.25 1.21 0.98 Death rate from Phthisis 2.47 1.72 1.74 Number of notifications of Infectious diseases (excluding Tuberculosis and Chicken- pox) 758 259 267 Notification-rate per 1,000 12.79 5.29 5.56 Infantile Mortalify per 1,000 births 126 (1905)* 113 78 Much work has again been done during the year under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and the Housing Regulations of September, 1910. 126 of the worst houses in the Borough were reported on in detail, and of these I represented 26 as being unfit for human habitation. * Details of births, names and addresses of mothers, etc., were not supplied until the latter part of 1904. 6 Of these 22 were made fit for human habitation and 3 were closed voluntarily. It was only necessary to make one closing order during the year, viz., for No. 19, Short's Gardens. This closing order was not determined as it is not proposed that the premises should be again used for human habitation. Of the remaining 100 houses, in 72 the defects were remedied, and in 28 the houses were closed voluntarily. A large number of other houses were inspected by me, but were not reported to the Housing of the Working Classes Committee as they did not appear to me to be in a state so injurious or dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation. Apart from general administrative measures consequent on new legislation, the following were the principal new developments introduced during the year:— (1) In order to further promote the proper care and feeding of children and further reduce the amount of preventible illness and mortality, the Mayor (Councillor Walter Hazell, J.P.) arranged to hold a baby show, and presented prizes and certificates to about 60 of the best infants between 6 and 12 months old. (2) In order to encourage a continuance of breast-feeding amongst a number of poor deserving mothers, 15 dozen dinner tickets were distributed to enable such mothers to obtain a sixpenny dinner at a restaurant in the Borough. (3) With the view of securing for London, more sunshine and a purer air with their physical, material and moral advantages, I presented a special report on the desirability of taking further steps for the abatement of smoke nuisances. The Committee agreed that the matter was one which should be brought to the notice of the ratepayers, and the Council sanctioned the distribution of a pamphlet, issued by the Coal Smoke Abatement Society, entitled "More Sunshine for London"; the pamphlet being accompanied by a letter from the Mayor emphasising the importance of the matter. Further details respecting these matters will be found under their respective headings. I desire to express my high appreciation of the assistance and hearty co-operation that 1 have received from the staff of the Public Health Department during the year. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND. 7 POPULATION AND HOUSES. The enumerated Population at the Census taken on Sunday, April 2nd, 1911, was 49,357, a reduction of 10,048 on the previous census of 1901 or 16.9 per cent. During the previous decennium 1891-1901 there was a reduction of 7,376 or 11.0 per cent. The Borough is becoming less and less residential and more and more important as a business centre. The number of factories, workshops, workplaces and offices keeps increasing so that we have now a very large day population. The density of the population was 122 persons per acre in comparison with 61 for London. The number of inhabited buildings was 7,985 and uninhabited 1,393, and 38 were in course of erection. Further details were given in my last Annual Report. ESTIMATED POPULATION, 1912. The following are the estimated populations at the middle of the year 1912:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury 24,317 Holbcrn Sub-District 23,709 Holborn Borough 48,026 London 4,519,754 REGISTERED BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATES.

Of the 780 registered births in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, a large proportion of which took place at the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, as many as 428 (393 legitimate and 35 illegitimate) were of infants whose mothers were nonresidents in the Borough. In addition I received information of the births in outlying Institutions of 78 infants whose mothers were residents of the Borough, 39 of St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 39 of the Holborn Division, and of 1 birth of the Holborn Division that was notified but not registered. 8 The corrected numbers are as follows:— District. Corrected number of Births of Residents. Corrected Birth-rate per 1000. Legitimate. Illegitimate. Total. 1912. 1911.

The number of deaths of children under one year of age, and the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 total registered births and per 1,000 corrected births, were the following for:— Deaths under 1 year of age. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 registered births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected legitimate births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected illegitimate births. Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 corrected births.

Only one of the 70 infants that died under one year of age was known to be an illegitimate child. A newly-born infant found in Bloomsbury Square was probably illegitimate. Of the 70 deaths of infants during the year the Lady Sanitary Inspector was able to obtain further details respecting 66. Of the remaining 4 cases, 2 had removed, one was above class visited, and in the remaining one the mother could not be found at home. Of the 66 deaths respecting which further details were obtained, 12, principally cases of premature birth, died before taking food; only 25 were breast fed, and 29 artificially fed. In 7 of these the mothers worked in factory or * workshop, 7 were engaged in charing or other work outside the home, and 1 was in domestic service. There were only 7 deaths from diarrhceal diseases. Only 3 of these took place in the third or summer quarter, 4 occurring in the last two months of the year. Of the 70 deaths 30 were from prenatal causes and 39 from postnatal causes, and 1 doubtful. The principal causes of death of these 70 children under one year of age are given in Table V. of the Appendix. PREVENTION OF INFANTILE MORTALITY. (1) Care and Feeding of Infants. In previous Annual Reports I have given details respecting visits and inquiries made by the Lady Sanitary Inspector, with a view to improving the health of infants and diminishing the infantile mortality in the Borough. If thought desirable, instructions are given respecting the care and feeding of the child and a leaflet left. Babies that are not thriving are periodically weighed. Notices are also served for any sanitary defects found. During the year 620 first visits were made. In 38 cases the mothers could not be traced. In the remaining 582 cases, 5 children did not live long enough to take any food, 16 were partly and 44 entirely artificially fed, and 517 were breast fed at the time of the first visit, about a fortnight after birth. A large number of revisits were made, particularly in the cases of children who were not breast fed, and especially those who were feeding on modified milk. 11 (2) Notification of Births Act, 1907, The total number of births notified in the Borough during the registration year 1912, was as follows:— Notified once only (a) By Doctors or Medical Students 954 (b) „ Midwives 214 (c) „ Parents and others 16 Notified twice (a) By Doctors and Parents 2 (b) „ Midwives and Parents — Total 1,186 During the same period 1,250 births were registered, (3) Modified Milk for Infants. In my Annual Report for 1906 I gave a detailed report respecting this matter and the arrangements made with the Express Dairy Company, who have various depots in and near the Borough to supply modified milk for infants of the working classes at the reduced rate of 4d. per day on production of a certificate from me. During the year 76 new certificates were issued, of which 13 were not used. Including 23 children who were taking the milk at the beginning of the year 1912, the milk was used by 86 children during the year, in comparison with 69 during the previous year. In the majority of cases the infants thrived well on the milk, in 7 cases however the milk was not suitable. In a number of cases the use of the milk was after various periods and for various reasons discontinued; in 8 cases on account of the mothers leaving the Borough. There were 6 deaths of the 86 infants who had been taking prepared milk during the year. One, however, had taken it only for 8 days during whooping cough, and another had not taken it for 8 weeks prior to death. The Mayor, Councillor Walter Hazell, J.P., has for a number of years very kindly assisted poor parents who cannot afford to pay the whole amount. Of the 86 children who were taking prepared milk during the year, the parents of as many as 62 children were so assisted. (4) Baby Show. In order to further promote the proper care and feeding of children and further reduce the amount of preventable illness and mortality, the Mayor B 2 12 (Councillor Walter Hazell, J.P.) arranged to hold a Baby Show, and presented prizes and certificates to about 60 of the best infants between 6 and 12 months old. These 60 were selected by the Lady Sanitary Inspector from infants of the working classes born between October 1st, 1911, and March 31st, 1912, and brought up in the Borough. They consisted of the following divisions:— (1.) 20 babies, 9-12 months old. Naturally fed to at least the 8th month. (2.) 20 babies, 6-9 months old. Naturally fed to at least the 6th month. (3.) 10 babies, 6-12 months old. Brought up on Prepared Milk. (4.) 10 twins (5 pairs), 6-12 months old. Mrs. Florence Willey, M.S., M.D., and Miss Elizabeth Bolton, M.D., B.S. kindly consented to act as Judges and two Lady Sanitary Inspectors of neighbouring Boroughs kindly assisted in the weighing of the babies, etc. The points taken into consideration were:—(1) weight; (2) teeth and bone development generally; (3) cleanliness, including condition of skin, freedom from abrasions, etc.; (4) suitability of clothing; (5) general fitness, condition of muscles, colour, vitality, etc. All that obtained full marks were counted first class. Those who failed to obtain full marks in one or two tests were counted second class, and all below this standard third class. The first prizes consisted of woolly garments (dresses, coats and shawls), the second prizes of woolly boots and caps, and the third prizes babies' socks. All also received a certificate. The prizes and certificates were given by the Mayoress, Mrs. Hazell. A number of members of the Public Health Committee were present, and in addition to the Mayor, the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (The Eev. W. H. Davies, M.A.), and the Medical Officer of Health gave short addresses. Tea for the mothers of the babies was also provided by the Mayor. (5) Dinner Tickets for Poor, Deserving Mothers. In order to encourage a continuance of breast feeding amongst a number of poor, deserving mothers, 15 dozen dinner tickets were distributed to enable such mothers to obtain a sixpenny dinner at a restaurant in the Borough. The Mayor, Councillor Walter Hazell, J.P., also paid for these tickets which were by arrangement secured at a reduced rate. 13 SENILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of persons 65 years of age and upwards was in:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury 81 Holborn Sub-District 122 Holborn Borough 203 St. Giles and Bloomsbury. Holborn Sub-District. Total Of these the numbers were— 65 years and under 70 24 39 63 70 ,, ,, 75 25 34 59 75 „ ,, 80 11 26 37 80 „ ,, 85 13 17 30 85 „ „ 90 6 1 7 90 years of age and upwards 2 5 7 81 122 203 DEATHS FROM EPIDEMIC DISEASES. The following tables give details respecting the number of deaths, and the deathrates, from the seven principal epidemic diseases, viz.:—Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria (including Membranous Croup), Whooping Cough, Fever (including Enteric or Typhoid, Typhus and Continued), and Diarrhoea. It will be seen that the number was only 47 in comparison with a decennial average of 73. The death-rate for the Borough was only 0.98 in comparison with 1.08 for London. Number. Epidemic Death-Rate. St. Giles and Bloomsbury 9 0.37 Holborn Sub-District 38 1.61 Holborn Borough 47 0.98 And for London 4,869 1.08 The following are the number of deaths from the separate diseases:— St. Giles and Bloomsbury.

MEASLES. Measles was much more prevalent than during the five preceding years, especially in the Holborn Division. We received information of 202 cases in comparison with 101 in 1911, 231 in 1910, 139 in 1909, and 86 in 1908. There were 25 deaths or a rate of 0.52 per thousand in comparison with a decennial rate of 0.36. Of these only 2 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 23 to the Holborn District. During the year the Education Department of the London County Council excluded all the unprotected children from certain classes, in the Infants' Department, of the undermentioned schools from and up to the dates specified:— Rosebery Avenue, Class Room B. 24th January to 2nd February. St. George-the-Martyr „ B. 13th May to 24th May. Do. „ D. 29th „ to 7th June. Princeton Street A. 10th June to 18th June. 15 St. Albans' Class Room A. 17th June to 21st June.

Rosebery Avenue „ B. 27th „ to 5th „ Do. „ A. 18th July to Summer Holidays, Do. „ B. 2nd October to 18th October. St. John-the-Evangelist „ C. 1st July to 5th July. Do. „ B. 4th „ to 19th „ Do. „ c. 10th „ to Summer Holidays. St. Giles-in-the-Fields „ A. 5th „ to 10th July. Of 99 cases visited, 58 were under 5 years of age. and in 38 of these, the infection was traced to children attending school. 79 were in 1 or 2 room dwellings, 20 in 3 or more rooms. In 84 of the 99 cases a doctor was in attendance. Since the Measles Order of the Local Government Board of the 30th May, 1911, in addition to Poor Law cases, persons that cannot be satisfactorily isolated and nursed at home can be removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, provided accommodation is available. 10 cases were so removed during the year. WHOOPING COUGH Whooping cough was returned as the cause of 7 deaths during the year, in comparison with 3 in the preceding year and 16 in 1910. Four of the deaths were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 3 in the Holborn District. All were children under 5 years of age, 6 being under 2 years. The death-rate was 017 per 1,000 in comparison with the decennial average of 0.26. On account of outbreaks of this disease, all children under 5 years were excluded from the Christ Church and Tower Street Schools, from 13th February, 1912, to 8th March, 1912, and from 1st May, 1912, to 24th May, 1912 respectively. On the 9th August, 1912, the Local Government Board issued an Order providing for the admission of any person who is not a pauper, to a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health, provided more accommodation is available than is required for pauper patients. 16 diarrh(ea and enteritis. The number of deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis was only 11. 5 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 6 to the Holborn District. 8 were children under 2 years of age, 7 being under 1 year of age. The Registrar-General in 1911, introduced a change in the method of classification of diarrhœal deaths. He takes the deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis under two years of age, instead of deaths at all ages from cholera, dysentery and diarrhoea. In estimating rates, he takes the number of deaths per 1,000 births instead of per 1,000 of the population. In the Borough this rate was only 8 88 per 1,000 births, in comparison with 12.42 for London with 1,371 deaths under two years of age. Only 3 of our deaths and 659 London deaths occurred during the exceptionally cold summer quarter, in comparison with 33 and 4,310 respectively during the exceptionally hot one of 1911. PHTHISIS. For details see pages 21-27. INFLUENZA. During the year there were 9 deaths registered as due to influenza, in comparison with only 1 in 1911. ALCOHOLISM. Only 17 deaths were assigned to alcoholism or cirrhosis of liver, 10 in St. Giles and Bloomsbury. and 7 in the Holborn District. These represent only a portion of the deaths really caused by alcoholism, as they are frequently registered under the headings of other secondary causes. CANCER. 59 deaths were registered as due to cancer or malignant disease, 33 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 26 to the Holborn District. SUDDEN AND VIOLENT DEATHS. Inquests.

NOTIFICATIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Excluding duplicate notifications and 210 notifications of Phthisis, the number of notifications of infectious diseases in the Borough during 1912 was 267 in comparison with a decennial average of 307. During the eight years 1904-1911 inclusive, the notifications per 1,000 of the population were less than for London, but last year were rather higher, namely 5.56 per 1,000 in comparison with 5.44 for London.

There was no notification of small-pox in the Borough during the year. SCARLET FEVER. Excluding duplicates, the number of notifications of scarlet fever was 113 in comparison with 120 in the year 1911. Of these 55 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 58 to the Holborn District. All the cases were removed to hospital. The number of notifications was equal to 2.36 per 1,000 in comparison with 2.50 for London. The average for the preceding decennium in the Borough was 2.54 per 1,000. Errors in Diagnosis. During the year 8 cases were returned as not suffering from scarlet fever, or 7.1 per cent. of the notifications. Secondary Cases of Scarlet Fever. Excluding the above 8 cases, of the remaining 105 notifications, 68 occurred in houses in which these was no secondary case. In 8 houses 2 cases occurred, in 4 including 2 public institutions 3 cases occurred, in 1, 4 cases, and in a Receiving Home for pauper children 5 cases occurred including a case that had been returned from the hospital in an apparently infective condition. Return Cases of Scarlet Fever. Of the above 23 secondary cases, 11 were "Return" cases, i.e., cases which occurred in a house soon after the return home of a patient from hospital. Of the 6 infecting cases, 1, as mentioned above, lead to as many as 4 cases, and another lead to 3 cases in the same house and a fourth in another house at which a relative of the patient lived. This is the largest number of return cases recorded in this Borough in any year, at least during the past ten years. DIPHTHERIA. The number of cases of diphtheria was 88 of which 39 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 49 to the Holborn District. All but two in each district were removed to Hospital. The notification rate was 1.83 per 1,000 in comparison with 1.57 per 1,000 for London. The average for the preceding decennium for the Borough was 1.14 per 1,000. Of the 88 cases 8 were on the nursing staff of the Hospital for Sick Children. c 2 20 Errors in Diagnosis. 7 of the patients were returned from the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board as not suffering from diphtheria, or 8.0 per cent. of the cases notified. Secondary Cases. Excluding the above 7 cases, and the 8 nurses at the Children's Hospital, of the remaining 73 cases, 58 occurred in houses in which there was no secondary case. In one house 3 cases occurred and in 6 houses 2 cases each. Return Cases. There was no "return" case during the year. Diphtheria Anti-toxin. Diphtheria Anti-toxin was supplied free of charge in 6 cases. ENTERIC FEVER. Excluding duplicates there were 12 notifications in comparison with 10 in the preceding year. 3 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury District and 9 to the Holborn District. All but one were removed to Hospital. These notifications corresponded to a rate of 0.25 per 1,000 in comparison with 0.15 for London. Errors in Diagnosis. 2 cases were returned from the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board not suffering from enteric fever or 167 per cent. of the eases notified. In 1 of these cases the Widal reaction was positive in the proportion of 1 in 80 just before the patient went to hospital. Of the remaining 10 cases 6 were certainly or probably not contracted in the Borough. 2 were nurses who had been previously nursing enteric fever patients. 1 was the occupier of a fried fish shop and probably contracted the disease in handling and cleansing infected fish. In the remaining case, watercress was the probable source of infection. CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER. (Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis). 1 case was notified during the year. The patient was a child living in the Italian Colony, and was removed to a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but was returned as suffering from tubercular meningitis and not cerebro spinal fever. 21 POLIO-MYELITIS AND ENCEPHALITIS. Acute Polio-myelitis and Encephalitis, or inflammation of the grey matter of the spinal cord and brain, commonly known as infantile paralysis, was made notifiable on the 1st September, 1911. No notification was received during the year. There were 132 notifications in London. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Ophthalmia Neonatorum is an infectious inflammation of the eyes in newlyborn children, and is the most common cause of blindness beginning in infancy. It became compulsorily notifiable on the 13th March, J911. Arrangements were made by the London County Council for cases of inflammation of the eyes in newly-born which are notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the County Council by midwives to be visited in the first instance by an Inspector under the Midwives Act, when, if hospital treatment is urgently necessary, immediate steps should be taken to obtain it and information sent to the Medical Officer of Health. 5 cases were notified in the Borough during the year, 2 in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 3 in the Holborn District. These cases were visited by the Lady Sanitary Inspector. 1 of the infants was attended at an Ophthalmic Hospital, 3 by their own doctors, and 1 was removed to the Central London Sick Asylum, all having nurses also in attendance. PHTHISIS OR CONSUMPTION. The number of deaths from phthisis during the year was 95, or a death-rate of 1.98 per 1,000, or 1.74 if corrected for sex and age distribution. Of these 35 belonged to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, a death-rate of 144, and 60 to the Holborn District or a death-rate of 2.54 per 1,000. Although the death-rate from phthisis is still high in the Borough there has been a satisfactory reduction in the death-rates during the past 10 years, as is shown in the table given below, the last 5 years having been much less than the first 5 years of that decennium. It must also be remembered that in Holborn there is a much larger proportion of persons living in common lodging houses than in any other London Borough. In Holborn the rate is as many as 355 beds per 10,000 of the population; whereas in Hampstead there are no common lodging houses, and 12 Boroughs have less than one-tenth the proportion of Holborn. 22 During the seven years 1904-1910 the average death-rate in common lodging houses in Holborn per 1,000 beds was about 20. Also during the past eight years more than 30 per cent. of the deaths from phthisis in Holborn had been residents in common lodging houses in the Borough. During the past year of the 95 deaths, 23 had been removed to infirmaries from common lodging houses in the Borough, that is about 25 per cent. and less than usual, 11 from St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 12 from the Holborn District. The corrected number of deaths in London was 6,069, equal to a rate of 1.35 per 1,000, the same rate as for 1911. The following table gives the number of deaths in the Holborn Borough and the death-rates per 1,000 (crude and corrected for sex and age distribution of the Holborn population in comparison with London) and the corresponding rates for London, for the 11 years 1902-1912.

Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908 & 1911. The Voluntary Notification of Consumption which had been in force from the 1st January, 1904, and had been partly superseded by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908 (Poor Law Cases), and the Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Regulations, 1911, was finally and completely superseded by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911, which came into force on the 1st January, 1912. Excluding duplicates the total number of notifications received was 210, of which 96 were under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, 79 23 under the Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Regulations, 1911, and 35 under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911. Of the total number, 73 or 34.8 per cent. were residents of common lodging houses and were all, at once or soon afterwards, removed to workhouse infirmaries. With few exceptions the remaining 137 lived in tenement houses, and 49 of these were removed to infirmary or hospital, 88 remaining at home, but some of these had previously been in infirmaries, hospitals or sanatoria. In previous annual reports I have given details of the action that is taken and the various results that were obtained from the enquiries made. After death, or removal to infirmary or hospital, disinfection is advised Consent for this was obtained in 45 cases. Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912. The above Tuberculosis Eegulations, 1908 and 1911, have now been superseded by the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Eegulations, 1912, which makes compulsory the notification of all forms of tuberculosis, and came into force on the 1st February, 1913. National Insurance Act, 1911. Sanatorium Benefit. In accordance with the above Act, Insurance Committees shall make arrange ments to the satisfaction of the Insurance Commissioners for the purpose of administering sanatorium benefit. Sanatorium benefit consists of treatment given at the cost of the National Health Insurance Fund to persons suffering from Tuberculosis (the chief form of which disease is consumption), or other approved diseases. For the time being the benefit is confined to tuberculosis. This benefit not only includes treatment of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis in sanatoria and other institutions, but also includes treatment at Tuberculosis Dispensaries and Domiciliary treatment by general medical practitioners. Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis. This Committee was appointed to report upon the consideration of general policy in respect of the problem of tuberculosis in the United Kingdom, in its preventive, curative, and other aspects, which should guide the Government and local bodies in making or aiding provision for the treatment of tuberculosis in sanatoria or other institutions or otherwise. 24 The Local Government Board agree generally with the findings of the Committee, and emphasize the point that any scheme which is to form the basis of an attempt to deal with the problem of tuberculosis should be available for the whole community. This Committee in their interim report recommend that for the prevention, detection and treatment of tuberculosis, existing public health administration should be supplemented by the establishment and equipment of two units linked up to the general public health and medical work now carried on and working in harmony with the general medical practitioners. The first unit consists of the tuberculosis dispensary, and the second of an institution in which in-patient treatment is given. The Committee expressed the opinion that the unit area for administration should generally be that of the County, County Borough, or groups of Counties and County Boroughs, and schemes should be undertaken by the Councils of Counties or County Boroughs, or by Joint Councils. In London, it seemed desirable to the Committee, that it should be considered whether some of the Sanatoria and Hospitals should not be provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and whether dispensaries should not be provided by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. Power is given to Sanitary Authorities under Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide hospitals and the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Eegulations, 1911, give power to Sanitary Authorities to supply medical or other assistance. The Eeport (par. 18) set out the functions of a dispensary to be :— (1.) Eeceiving House and centre of diagnosis. (2.) Clearing House and centre for observation. (3.) Centre for curative treatment (home treatment). (4.) Centre for the examination of contacts. (5.) Centre for after care. (6.) Information Bureau and Educational centre. The Committee expressed the opinion that one dispensary would be required for every 150,000 to 200,000 of the population. The Holborn Council adopted the following resolutions :— (a) That the Council agrees with the views expressed by the Departmental Committee on tuberculosis that Sanatoria and Hospitals required or London should be provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. (b) That it is desirable that a Tuberculosis Dispensary should be established in or for the Borough. 25 A Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils was held at our offices on the 19th July, 1912, and adopted resolutions in favour of the provision of Sanatoria and Hospital accommodation by the Metropolitan Asylums Board and that Tuberculosis Dispensaries should be established and controlled by the Metropolitan Borough Councils either singly or in groups. Tuberculosis Dispensary. The provision of a Tuberculosis Dispensary in or for the Borough has received very much consideration and I presented 2 reports to the Public Health Committee and the Holborn Provisional Insurance Committee on the subject. As there is a Local Insurance Committee for each Borough, the administration would be much simplified if there was also a Tuberculosis Dispensary for each Borough. The Bloomsbury Dispensary at which a number of consumptives already received treatment, I thought would be much increased in usefulness and importance by the addition of a Consulting Tuberculosis Officer. I was of opinion therefore that the most convenient, practical and economical arrangement would be for the Holborn Council to make arrangements, if possible, with the managers of the Bloomsbury Dispensary for the use of that dispensary as a tuberculosis dispensary on 2 or 3 days a week at hours when it is not required as a general dispensary; and that a part time Consulting Officer (Chief Tuberculosis Officer) should be appointed, such officer not to be engaged in private practice, but allowed other work at a similar tuberculosis dispensary, or at a hospital for consumption, or as a consultant. The Departmental Committee recommended that in connection with a Tuberculosis Dispensary there should be well trained nurses, a whole or part time dispenser, and facilities for bacteriological examination. All these are already provided by or working in combination with the Bloomsbury Dispensary. A large number of patients, including cases of consumption, are attended by nurses of the Bloomsbury District Nurses Association, and the Lady Superintendent informed me that she was very desirous of increasing their work in connection with consumption. Soon after the issue of this report a letter was received from the Town Clerk of the City of London suggesting that the Council should co-operate with the Corporation of London and the Finsbury Borough Council in the establishment of a dispensary by arrangement with St. Bartholomew's Hospital. We also received suggestions from other authorities that we should co-operate with them, viz., the Royal Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, City Road; the Middlesex Hospital; the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street; the Provisional Medical Committee for the Westminster and Holborn Division; and in that connection also from the Medical Officer of Health of the City of Westminster. D 26 I had various interviews and consultations with these Medical Officers of Health and the medical and other authorities of the above hospitals and dispensary; also with the Medical Officer and Medical Inspectors of the Local Government Board, and attended a conference at the Local Government Board between representatives of the Local Government Board, the National Health Insurance Commissioners and the Medical Officers of the various Metropolitan Borough Councils. After very careful consideration of the matter I was of opinion that the amalgamation of the City of London, Finsbury and Holborn would form an excellent area for a complete scheme comprising as it does the Registrar General's Central Division of the Metropolitan Area. Also as the Departmental Committee advise that in framing complete schemes regard should be had to all existing authorities, organizations and institutions with a view to avoiding waste by overlapping, and to obtain their co-operation in the scheme proposed, I thought it desirable that the Bloomsbury Dispensary and the institutions working in co-operation therewith as mentioned in my first report should be affiliated with the St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The authorities of the Bloomsbury Dispensary have however since intimated that they are not prepared to further entertain the proposal for the establishment of a tuberculosis dispensary at their institution. On the 17th December, the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, with the Town Clerk and the Medical Officer of Health, had a conference with the Sanitary Committee of the Corporation and representatives of the Finsbury Borough Council in connection with the above, and as a result of the conference the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London was requested to prepare a draft scheme and forward it for consideration by the Borough Councils. The matter was subsequently adjourned for consideration after consultation with the permanent District Insurance Committee for the Borough which was to be appointed soon afterwards. Holborn Provisional Insurance Committee. The first meeting of this Committee was held in September, 1912, when I submitted reports on a scheme for dispensary and domiciliary treatment of cases; the fees to be paid to dispensaries and doctors; the purchase of drugs and medicine and the fees to be paid therefor; the preparation of lists of doctors who shall attend patients at their homes; the linking of dispensary and home treatment. 27 On the 26th July, 1912, the Local Government Board issued a General Order prescribing domiciliary treatment of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis. This Order provided that until a Consulting Officer of a Dispensary approved by the Board had been appointed the Medical Officer of Health should act in that capacity. By the end of the year only 5 applications for sanatorium benefit had been forwarded to me. Of these, 1 soon removed to another district; in 2 cases, in both of which no tubercle bacilli were found, arrangements were made for the continuance of treatment at the Tuberculin Dispensary, in Kennington Road; in 1, I made arrangements for domiciliary treatment, and in the remaining 1, the patient was advised to continue attending the Bloomsbury Dispensary pending removal to Sanatorium.

As the Council's Shelter for the accommodation of persons during the disinfection of their houses at No. 191, High Holborn, was demolished in July, 1906, the Council made arrangements with the adjoining Borough of Finsbury for the use of their shelter. As the disinfectors work very early and very late, if required, it was only necessary to use the shelter during the year for the accommodation of 3 families consisting of 14 persons. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT. During the first quarter of the year 23 persons (21 men and 2 women) infested with vermin had their bodies and clothing disinfected free of charge. All had their bodies cleansed in the baths of the St. Giles and Bloomsbury Casual Wards in Goldsmith Street, and 940 articles were disinfected in the Council's steam apparatus. The Casual Wards were taken over by the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the 1st April, and new arrangements for the cleansing of persons were considered by the Public Health Committee. The Coroner's Court, which used to be on the ground floor of the Public Mortuary was transferred to the Court Room on the completion of the new Council Offices in 1908. Various plans and suggestions for the alteration of the Mortuary to include a Cleansing Station for men and women were submitted to the Public Health Committee, and the alterations and improvements were completed by May, 1913. Under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, powers are given to that Council for the compulsory cleansing of verminous children attending any of the Council's schools, and verminous inmates of any common lodging house. 29 HOUSING, TOWN PLANNING, &c.

One pending (40 and 42, Short's Gardens). * A number of other inspections made toward the end of the year and dealt with in 1913 will be included in Report for that year. 31 A large number of other houses were inspected by me, but were not reported to the Housing of the Working Classes Committee, as they did not appear to me to be in a state so injurious or dangerous to health as to be unfit for human habitation. It was only necessary to make one closing order during the year—viz., for No. 19, Shorts Gardens. This closing order was not determined, as it is not proposed that the premises should be again used for human habitation but only for storage purposes. I made lists of dwelling-houses, including the above 126, the early inspection of which was in my opinion desirable, and keep adding to these lists from time to time. Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. In accordance with the Sub-Section 7 of the same Section (17) of the Act, I prepared suggested regulations, and after careful consideration by the Committee the matter was adjourned for the present. Certificates under Section 35 I was asked for a Certificate under the above section for a large common lodging house Nos. 7-11, Short's Gardens, and 3, Neal's Yard. I informed the Applicant that I should be prepared to grant a Certificate if a number of trough closets were replaced by proper and suitable water closets, and the ventilation of another water closet improved. When this work was carried out I granted the Certificate. list of premises closed, demolished or rebuilt during 1912. St. Giles and Bloomsbury. Alfred Mews, South Side. Demolished.

WATER SUPPLY TO NEW BUILDINGS. During the year I inspected and gave certificates for the following premises :— 46 and 47, Red Lion Street. 10, Little Turnstile. Y.M.C.A. Tottenham Court Road. Examination Hall, Queen Square. Nurses' Home, 71—75, Great Ormond Street Shaftesbury Hotel, Great St. Andrew Street. Warwickshire House, 44 to 54, Gower Street and Malet Street. Brownlow House, 29, Brownlow Street, and 50 and 51, High Holborn. WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES. In accordance with Section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, 21 notices were served for the provision of additional water supply in tenement houses, and in the majority of cases the work required was E 2 36 completed during the year. In cases where the lease of the premises expired within twelve months the notices were allowed to stand over. In the year 1908, when the above section first came into operation 403 such notices were served. BY-LAWS AS TO HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. At the end of the year, 606 houses were registered under these By-laws, of these, 311 are in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 295 in the Holborn District, 34 such houses were removed from the Register principally on account of the closing or demolition of the houses, and in some cases because the houses are now occupied only by members of one family, and 7 were added to the Register. During the year, there were 998 inspections of these premises, excluding a very large number of periodical inspections and re-inspections. 19 notices were served for 25 overcrowded rooms, and 215 notices for other breaches of the By-laws, exclusive of 614 notices that were served for annual cleansing as required by the By-laws. REVENUE ACTS. Forty-seven applications were received during the year for Certificates from me under the above Acts. One comprising one tenement (a flat) was granted, and 46 comprising about 230 tenements were refused. Most of the latter were about to be dealt with under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, and a number have since been closed. OVERCROWDING. The number of dwelling rooms found to be overcrowded was 39, in comparison with 64 in the previous year. 25 of these were dealt with as breaches of the By-laws as to houses let in lodgings. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. In accordance with the Contract, all house refuse has to be removed at least twice a week, and oftener if required by the Medical Officer of Health. In the main thoroughfares there is a daily collection before 10 a.m. As usual, much attention was given to securing the regular removal of house refuse. A large number of inspections were made by me, and the inspectors, including early morning inspections, of the streets in which there is a daily removal. Only 15 genuine complaints respecting non-removal of house refuse were received from householders. 93 notices were served for the provision of proper dust receptacles. During the year a number of applications were received for the removal of trade refuse for which the Contractor is paid by the owners in accordance with Section 33 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 37 REMOVAL OF MANURE. The removal of manure was again carried out satisfactorily. No genuine complaint was received. Posters requiring the periodical removal of manure and other refuse matter from all stables or other premises in the Borough not less frequently than every 48 hours were again posted in the various mews in the Borough. COMMON LODGING HOUSES ACTS, 1851 and 1853. The Secretary of State, by a Provisional Order which came into operation on the 1st November, 1894, transferred to the London County Council the powers of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police in respect of common lodging houses. The following is a list of the Common Lodging Houses registered in this Borough at the end of the year 1911 :— Of these 14 are in St. Giles and Bloomsbury for 1,060 lodgers. „ 7 „ Holborn District for ... 622 „ Total 21 in the Borough for ... ... ... 1,682 „ St. Giles and Bloomsbury.

There is a very large number of workplaces other than the above, the registration of which is not required, and many of them were inspected and notices served where necessary. BAKEHOUSES. At the end of the year 1912, there were 32 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 13 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury and 19 in the Holborn District. 39 The following is a list of the bakehouses in the Borough all of which are underground except those marked * :— St. Giles and Bloomsbury. *2 Bloomsbury Court. 19 Little Earl Street. 10 Bury Street. 5 Little St. Andrew Street. 164 Drury Lane. 21 Marchmont Street. 155 High Holborn. 77 Marchmont Street. 217 & 218 High Holborn (Holborn Restaurant). 8 Museum Street. 200 Shaftesbury Avenue. 63 High Street. *15 Torrington Place.

During the year, in addition to my inspections, there were 227 inspections of bakehouses, including 36 inspections of the factory bakehouses. Seven notices were served for various sanitary defects. HOME WORK. Details are given in the preceding Table, and in Table VIII. 3 of the Appendix. Many inspections of homeworkers' premises are also made during house to house and periodical inspections of lodging houses and dwelling houses in which homeworkers reside. Further details respecting factories, workshops, laundries, workplaces and home work are given in Table VIII. (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) of the Appendix. PLACES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED FOR SALE. Under this head are included kitchens of hotels, restaurants and eatinghouses of all sorts, slaughter-houses, tripe, offal and other meat shops, fried 40 fish, eel and other fish shops, premises where ice cream is made, and other places where food is prepared for sale, excluding bakehouses which are given on a previous page. The number of these places on the. register at the end of 1912 was 379; 2,147 inspections were made, and 60 notices were served during the year for sanitary defects found. In addition to the above inspections of places where food is prepared for sale, there were also 851 inspections of market streets, each of which includes a number of stalls at which meat, fish, fruit and vegetables are sold. These streets are also regularly inspected on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings. SLAUGHTER HOUSE. There is now only one slaughter-house in the Borough, viz., No. 29, Red Lion Street, which, in addition to my inspections, was inspected on 11 occasions during the year. Only sheep are killed. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. The number of registered dairies and milkshops in the Borough at the end of the year was 184, of which 74 were in St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 110 in the Holborn District. In all 17 dairies and milk shops were newly registered, 3 belonging to St. Giles and Bloomsbury, and 14 to the Holborn District, and 10 were removed from the Register. In addition to my inspections the Sanitary Inspectors made 759 inspections of these premises, and 5 notices were served for sanitary defects or breaches of regulations, and in some cases alterations were carried out without the service of notices. ICE CREAM. During the year there were 35 premises in the Borough where ice cream was manufactured or sold, and in addition to my inspections, 125 inspections of these premises were made. Four notices were served for sanitary defects. As ice cream is often made in the early morning, inspections between 6 and 9 a.m. were also occasionally made in order to ascertain whether there were any infringements of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. No such infringement was found. 41 UNSOUND FOOD. Applications were received for removal and destruction as trade refuse of the following articles of food, all of which were unsound and unfit for the food of man:— 30 crates Bananas. 6 bundles Tomatoes. 429 tins Preserved Fruits (assorted). 14 bottles Do. 69 lbs. Spanish Onions. 1 bag Chestnuts. 16 stone Pork (2 fore quarters). 1 jar Marmalade. 40 bottles Jelly. 53 tins Sardines. 6 tins Tinned Fish. 1 tin Tinned Meats. 1 trunk Whiting. 1 Turkey. 2 tins Condensed Milk. 10 jars Mustard. 5 tins Spinach. OFFENSIVE FUMES FROM FACTORIES. During the year 1909 four new oil engines were provided by an Electric Supply Company; much nuisance was caused by offensive fumes emitted from the chimney shaft receiving the exhaust pipes from these engines, and many complaints were received. The matter received much careful consideration, and various alterations were carried out by the Company, and the exhaust pipes were carried up more than 20 feet above the top of the chimney shaft. As further complaints were received, the Company in 1910 carried up these exhaust pipes an additional 15 feet. Notwithstanding this, the nuisance continued from time to time. Plans for the construction of a chimney stack of ferro-concrete, about 150 feet high, were submitted to the London County Council. Since the completion of the work last year no complaints have been received. Complaints are occasionally received of nuisances from offensive fumes from other premises which have been dealt with in former years. These are now only due to some accident or temporary defect, and the nuisances are soon abated. SMOKE ABATEMENT. The smoke shafts in the Borough were frequently kept under observation, and in 111 cases the inspections were recorded. Five intimation notices and 1 statutory notice were served. On account of complaints respecting frequent smoke nuisances from a factory chimney, this chimney was kept under consecutive observation for two periods of three hours each, and nine photographs of black smoke were taken. I found that F 42 one of the boilers was a very old one, having been erected in the year 1894. I saw the Manager and wrote to the Company respecting the matter, and. after further coi'respondence, the Company agreed to have a new boiler provided in the place of this old one. MORE SUNSHINE FOR LONDON. Further Steps for the Abatement of Smoke Nuisances. The Mayor (Councillor Walter Hazell, J.P.), was very anxious that further steps should be taken for the abatement of smoke nuisances, and consulted me respecting the matter. I prepared a report, which included the following:— Until about twenty years ago the smoke nuisance in London had been increasing, so that the amount of winter sunshine had been diminishing and fogs had been increasing both in density and frequency. During the past twenty years, however, there has fortunately been much improvement. In the five years from 1885 to 1890 the mean number of hours of sunshine in the winter months was only 57, while in the five years 1905 to 1910 it averaged 103 hours, an increase of more than 80 per cent. In the five years from 1885 to 1890 the days of fog in the winter months averaged 31; in the last five years they averaged 17, or a reduction of more than 45 per cent. Many of us have known the time when black fog has lasted sometimes as long as a week continuously. Although much has been effected there is still much, room for improvement. Smoke abatement not only means more sunshine and less fog, but it also means improved health and well-being, a purer atmosphere and increasing cleanliness of the exteriors and interiors not only of our buildings but also of our persons. Much less damage would be done to our buildings and much less money would have to be spent in cleansing and decorating them, and much less soap would be required. Observations were made at three stations in London and at one at Sutton, Surrey, of the amount of coal smoke deposit during the twelve months, June 13th, 1910, to June 13th, 1911, and it was found that in the City of London there was a deposit of as much as 650 tons per square mile. At Sutton, in Surrey, it was less than one-third this amount. A great improvement has not only been effected in the abatement of smoke nuisances in connection with factories and business premises but much less smoke is also produced in residential buildings which is chiefly due to the increasing use for heating and cooking of gas and electricity and solid smokeless fuel such as anthracite, coke, etc. For instance, the gas stoves, fires and other heating and 43 cooking appliances supplied by the principal London gas companies now exceed 1,300,000, and must contribute in no small measure to the cleansing of the atmosphere. Moreover, these various methods of smoke abatement not only lead to greater cleanliness and improved health, but are also generally conducive to greater convenience and the saving of labour, and are directly or indirectly less expensive than smoke producing furnaces and fires. In the Report I also mentioned that the Council might set a good example in smoke abatement by having gas fires in the Mayor's Parlour and the Public Health Department. The Public Health Committee agreed that the matter was one which should be brought to the notice of the ratepayers, and the Council sanctioned the distribution of a pamphlet issued by the Coal Smoke Abatement Society entitled "More Sunshine for London;" the pamphlet being accompanied by a letter from the Mayor emphasising the importance of the matter and urging the desirability of cultivating a public spirit in reducing the amount of coal smoke, and so to improve the condition of the whole of the people of London. About 10,500 of these pamphlets were so sent out. For further details of Sanitary Work and Legal Proceedings see Tables V., VI., VII., VIII., IX. and X. METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1912. The mean temperature of the year was 51.0, and was 0Q.9 above the average for the preceding 65 years as deduced from observations at Greenwich, under the superintendence of the Astronomer lioyal. The rainfall was 24.87 inches, and was 0.75 inches above the average. The daily mean duration of bright sunshine was 3.74 hours, and was 0.43 hours below the average of the preceeding 15 years.

The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 55 TABLE VIII.-continued. 4.—Registered Workshops.
