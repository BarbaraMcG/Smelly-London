June, 1937. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Hayes and Harlinston. Mr. Chairman, Madam and Gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you the thirty-second Annual Report on the health of this Urban District. The death-rate is again below the average for Urban Districts of England and Wales and the birth-rate is also favourable in that it is 5-2 per 1,000 higher than the average. No noteworthy cause of illness has been observed during the past year and the health of the town may be considered as very satisfactory. I should like to thank you for your support to my department in the past year and would include in my expression of gratitude the officials of the Council. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, J. STANLEY LLOYD, Medical Officer of Health. SECTION A. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 5,161 (Census, 193123,646 Population (Mid-year,. 1936) Registrar-General's Estimate: Working Population Figure 34,080 Present estimated population at 4 persons per house 39,392 Number of inhabited houses end of 1936 9,848 Rateable value £240,555 Sum represented by a penny rate Gross £1,002 Net (Est.) £892 SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The Urban District of Hayes and Harlington comprises the parishes of Hayes, Harlington and that portion of Cranford to the west of the River Crane. The height above sea-level varies from 182 feet at the top of Charville Lane to 70 feet at the point below the bridge where the Bath Road crosses the Crane. Building development is advancing with great rapidity and it would appear that if the present rate of progress continues it cannot be long before the district is completely urbanized. The Council on that account is taking steps to ensure that certain pieces of land shall be added to the already existing open spaces. These at present are 345 acres in extent but it is hoped to increase this amount very considerably in the near future. Unemployment is small in the district, due, no doubt, to the large number of factories established here, and to its proximity to London. The population has, for the same reason, changed from one which was purely agricultural and horticultural at the beginning of the present century to an almost entirely industrial one. The houses in Hayes and Harlington are nearly all of modern construction and no slum areas exist, although from time to time old cottages are condemned as unfit for human habitation. There is a considerable number of Council houses in the town and these have been laid out with care and due regard to the density per acre. These housing estates compare very favourably with some other estates which have been developed since the war and would appear to be the best solution to the problem of housing the industrial population. There is a recent tendency to building flats which appears to be undesirable in a district of this kind, where sites for building have not yet reached a 4 prohibitive price. It is better for young families to have easy access from the ground floor to their gardens, as there is then an induient for them to enjoy the fresh air. This particularly applies where there are babies and young children. Extracts from Vital Statistics of the Year. Total M. F.

GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA. No alteration has been made in the health services of this area during 1936. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS OF THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. The staff of the Public Health Department consists of one part-time Medical Officer and four Sanitary Inspectors, the Chief Sanitary Inspector being also the Inspector under the Petroleum Acts and the Shops Acts. The Chief Sanitary Inspector and one other Inspector hold the special Meat and Food Inspector's Certificate of the Royal Sanitary Institute. Contributions to the salaries of these Officers are received from the Exchequer. 8 Dr. Bousfield, Medical Officer in charge of the Diphtheria Immunisation Clinic, is paid on a sessional basis. Laboratory facilities are provided at the Clinical Research Association for the examination of sputum, swabs, etc., for the detection of infectious disease. An ambulance is kept at the fire station for all non-infectious cases and is provided free of cost. Infectious cases are removed, also free of cost, by the ambulance kept at the Joint Hospital in Uxbridge. In case of emergency where the ambulance may be out when required, reciprocal arrangements have been made with all surrounding local authorities. There is thus adequate provision in this respect. A district nurse is stationed at the Hayes Cottage Hospital for dealing with Hayes cases and another lives in Harlington to serve that parish. Welfare Clinics under the Middlesex County Council are held at Queen's Hall, Townfield Council School and Village Hall, Cherry Lane. The Diphtheria Immunisation Clinic is referred to later. Hospitals.—Hayes Cottage Hospital, 15 beds, and Harlington Cottage Hospital, 14 beds, are subsidised by the Council to the extent of a penny rate. Hillingdon County Hospital serves this district and occasionally West Middlesex County Hospital at Isleworth is used. The big London hospitals are utilised to a large extent for more serious cases. SECTION C. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water.—A sample of water was taken from the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Co., another from the South-West Suburban Water Co., and another from the Allied Building Corporation water supply. All on bacteriological examination proved to be fit for drinking. Another sample taken from a private well in Cranford proved to be unfit for drinking purposes. The occupants of the house, on being warned not to drink the water before it was boiled, agreed to take the supply from the main. The results of the bacteriological examination of all the samples submitted are set out in an abridged form in the table. 9 10 SUMMARY OF REPORTS OF WATER SAMPLES SUBMITTED FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION, 1936. Report No. and Date. Organisms produced on gelatine plates incubated at 20° C. for 3 days. Organisms produced on agar plates incubated at 37.5° C. for 2 days. B. Coli. Streptococci. CI. Welchii.

This water contains a considerable number of excremental organisms and at present is not in a fit condition for drinking purposes. 58044 28/12/36 102 per c.c. 11 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c.

Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. The bacterial count shows some increase as compared with the previous sample, but no excremental organisms are present and the water may be considered fit for drinking purposes. 58046 28/12/36 88 per c.c. 17 per c.c. Not found in 100 c.c. Not found in 30 c.c. Present in 100 c.c. Not found in less. The sample appears to be from a treated supply and a few spores have survived. Taking the result as a whole the water may be regarded as suitable for drinking purposes. Where new streets have been built the mains have been correspondingly extended but the supply has always proved to be sufficient. Drainage and Sewerage.—The new sewers commencing at Coldharbour Lane and emptying into the new West Middlesex trunk sewer were completed this year. The new sewer has rendered the ejector station at Botwell and the disposal works at Minet Drive and East Bedfont unnecessary and these have now been closed down. Since 1932, £146,000 has been spent on enlarging, extending and bringing up to date the sewerage systems of Hayes and Harlington and on connecting them to the West Middlesex trunk sewers. Rivers and Streams.—Owing to the abolition of the disposal works at Minet Drive and East Bedfont, the pollution of the River Crane has materially lessened. Closet Accommodation.—Ten pail-closets have been converted to the water-carriage system during the year. The estimated number of the various types remaining at the end of 1936 is:— Water-closets 10,874 Closets with moveable receptacles 194 Closets with fixed receptacles 13 Public Cleasing.—An extra freighter has been purchased to deal with the cleansing of streets and the collection of house refuse. Pail-closets are emptied every week and cesspools at longer intervals, the contents being discharged into the sewers. House refuse is collected once a week by closed freighters and tipped at Yeading dump, where it is covered with dead ash or earth. The face of the tip is not allowed to remain uncovered for more than one day. 11 SANITARY INSPECTION OF AREA. 1.—Complaints.

One statutory notice has been served to abate the nuisance from smoke. The factories are visited from time to t i. .and discussions with the engineers of these factories have resulted in co-operation with a view to the reduction of smoke. 7.—SWIMMING BATHS AND POOLS. There is one privately owned open-air swimming bath in the district. The water is pumped from the bath, filtered, aerated and chlorinated and then returned to the bath. 8.—ERADICATIOMN OF BED-BUGS. _ No Council houses have been found to be infested with bedbugs. Three other houses found to be infested have been disinfested by spraying with paraffin and lysol. Disinfestation is not carried out by the local authority except in the case of Council houses. With a view to making sure that the personal effects and furniture of persons granted Council houses are free from vermin, enquiries are made as to the condition of the houses occupied by the incoming tenants. SCHOOLS. Most of the public elementary schools in this district are of modern construction. There are two schools, however, which have been erected for more than seventy-five years and these, while being satisfactory from a sanitary point of view, do not compare in any way with the schools of modern construction. When a case of infectious disease arises in a school it is notified by the Head Teacher to the Medical Officer, or by the Medical Officer to the Head Teacher, whichever becomes first aware of it. There are three private schools in the area accommodating about seventy scholars. These have been inspected and the sanitary arrangements and water supply found to be adequate. SPECIAL CLASSES OF PREMISES AND OCCUPATIONS SUBJECT TO CONTROL BY THE LOCAL AUTHORITY. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES There are nine slaughter-houses scattered throughout the district.

The result was that, according to the standard laid down in the Act, 135 cases of overcrowding, affecting a total of 1,020 persons, were discovered. To deal with this question of overcrowding the Council have proposals to build sixty-seven houses. SECTION E. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. (a) Milk Supply. Ninety visits of inspection have been made to the cowsheds and dairies in the district, which have been maintained in fair condition. There are approximately 200 milch cows in the district. Inspection of dairy cattle by a veterinary inspector for the detection of tuberculous animals is undertaken by the County Council. Fifteen samples of milk have been submitted for bacterial count during the year. The report of the bacteriologist is set out below in tabular form. There is one producer in the district licensed by the County Council under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936, for the production of accredited milk. The table below gives particulars of the twenty-hve licences granted during the year :— Designation. Dealer's Licence. ementary Licence.

All bottles are of course sterilised before use, but this practice is, nevertheless, undesirable. (b) Meat. Meat inspection is carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors, who have made 1,955 visits of inspection to the slaughter-houses. No notification of intended slaughter under the Tuberculosis Order of 1925 was received. No system of marking inspected carcases has been adopted. CARCASES EXAMINED AND MEAT CONDEMNED, 1936.

PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER# INFECTIOUS DISEASES. GENERAL There'was an increase of 50 per cent, in the incidence of scarlet fever during the year over the figures of the previous one, with a case mortality of 1-7 per cent. Diphtheria, on the other hand, diminished by 40 per cent, and the case mortality by 75 per cent, to 2-56 per cent. Diphtheria Immunisation.—The free Diphtheria Clinic, commenced in October, 1935, has proved to be a success as large numbers of names of children between the ages of one and sixteen have been registered at the Town Hall for immunisation. The clinic meets at the Cottage Hospital, Hayes, on Saturday mornings at 10.30. During the year forty-three sessions were held, 2,385 attendances were recorded and 312 certificates of immunity were issued. Notifiable Diseases (other than Tuberculosis) during the Year, 1936.
