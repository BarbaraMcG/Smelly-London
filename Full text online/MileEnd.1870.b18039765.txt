Various works have been undertaken during the year that has elapsed, for extending and giving efficiency to the sewerage of the district, and for paving and improving the streets, which it is not proposed to enumerate in this place, as they will be found in ample detail in the Report of the Surveyor to the Vestry, which is appended hereto, for the information of the ratepayers. These works are intended to carry out by steps the general plan which has been in progress, throughout the existence of the Vestry, for bettering the sanitary condition of the Hamlet, and adding to the comfort and convenience of those who use its public thoroughfares. From the Surveyor's report, it will likewise be seen that the maintenance of existing works, as distinguished from the formation of new works, has not been lost sight of; it being most important that the process of renewal should be continually carried on in such a manner that repairs may keep pace with waste and wear. The Vestry have not been unmindful of their duties and the demands made upon them, as the sanitary authority. The following is a list of the minor works which, acting in that capacity, they have caused to bo effectually carried out:— 8 Old drains abolished 94 Houses and premises connected with sewers 125 Foul drains cleansed 103 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 18 Traps provided for drains, closets, &c. 530 Houses cleansed and purified 108 Dust bins provided 72 Premises from which Pigs were removed 12 Houses visited where disease has occurred, and notices left, re " Contagious Diseases " 348 Yards belonging to houses, re-paved, &c. 62 Dung pits removed 4 The numerous Cow houses, Slaughter houses and Bakehouses in the Hamlet have been periodically visited, under the directions of the Sanitary Committee, and, in all of them, the observance of such precautions as are necessary for the public health has been enforced. At the Licensing Court, held in October last, the occupiers of 42 slaughter houses and 36 cow houses received lincenses from the Justices, and, in every case, the decision was in accordance with the views of the Sanitary Committee, based on a survey of the premises or the reports of the Officers of Health. The accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1870, were, at the appointed time, submitted to the Auditors, and duly vouched and allowed, and an abstract of them is appended to this Report. In the course of the year the White Horse Lane Improvement, which had been unavoidably delayed, was completed, and the thoroughfare, as widened at the north end, where it runs out of the Mile End Road, opened to the public. This improvement was effected by the removal of several houses, which were purchased by the Vestry, and would have been sooner acquired, 9 Lad it not been thought advisable to allow certain leasehold interests in the meantime to expire. By this means, and a consequent diminution in the number of persons to be compensated, although some delay was incurred, a great saving was effected. The total cost of the improvement amounts to nearly £3000, of which, £1200 has, by virtue of a previous arrangement, been contributed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. To enable them to meet the necessary expenditure, the Vestry borrowed £1600 of the Star Life Assurance Society, which bears interest at five per cent. per annum, and is to be paid off by annual instalments of £100 each. In the Session of 1869, "The North Metropolitan Tramways Company" obtained an Act of Parliament, enabling them, amongst other works, to lay down a double line of tramway throughout the whole length of the Mile End Road; and the Vestry, under the statutory powers given them, required the Company to pave the road with granite pitchers, for a width of above 17 feet down the centre, from one end of the Hamlet to the other. It has long been apparent that the whole of the Mile End Road must eventually be paved with this material, which, although expensive in the first instance, is economical in the long run; and the paving laid down by the Company will be a substantial contribution to the projected work.

TUCKER, WALTER CLARKE, REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE VESTRY OF THE Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. REPORT. June, 1870. Gentlemen, It is again my privilege to lay before you a summary of the various works performed in the Hamlet under my supervision. Paved Carriageways. A most important work has been performed in the Mile End Road, not at the cost, but under the immesupervision of, the Paving Committee, and myself, as their representative, in the shape of the North Metropolitan Tramway, the first in London of a new system of street tramways, and which, I think, promises to be vastly extended throughout all the suburbs of the metropolis. This work in itself is one of great benefit to the Hamlet, inasmuch as the Company, who had obtained parliamentary powers to construct the line, are bound, by a clause of their Act, "to pave, and at all times to keep paved, the whole of the roadway within their rails, and 18 inches on each side thereof." In pursuance of this clause, there have been laid along the centre of the Mile End Road, available for all traffic, 12,401 feet superficial yards of carriageway paving, of the value, and therefore saving to the Vestry, of £6231 1s. 6d. e 4 The stones within the rails vary, some are 3 in. wide by 5 in. deep, some 4 in. wide and 5 in. deep, and some 3 in. wide and 6 in. deep. The stones on the outside of the rails are 4 in. wide and 9 in. deep. The sleepers and stones inside the rails are laid on a bed of Portland cement concrete 6 in. deep. The works were commenced in December, but were not completed, fit for the traffic of cars, until the 1st of May. There was much hard frost and bad weather in January and February, and large portions of the work performed during those months had to be taken up and relaid. The whole is now in excellent working order, and is, I think, universally acknowledged to be one of the greatest improvements in travelling introduced in modern times. For the information of those who may be unacquainted with the construction of this Tramway, I append a transverse section, shewing its construction. By an arrangement made by the Highway Committee with the contractors for the Tramway Company's works, the Vestry acquired 787½ yards of pitching, 9 in. by 3 in. and 9 in. by 4 in., which had been laid, in various crossings, by the Trustees of the turnpike road, previous to the Mile End Road coming under the control of the Vestry. This pitching has been laid in improving the entrances to the principal thoroughfares leading from the Mile End Road, by abolishing the channel in the line of the main road, and paving the whole space from the 5 line of the Tramway Company's work to the line of the houses in the road. This has necessitated the taking up and re-laying of 3148 yards of stone already laid. The following are Streets at which these works have been performed: Sidney Street Globe Road Cambridge Heath Road Bancroft Road Jubilee Street Bancroft Road Cleveland Street St. Peter's Road Grove Street Another important work has been accomplished during the year— The White Horse Lane Improvement. For some years past this work has been projected, and some portion of the property actually purchased by the Vestry; but, owing to the difficulty in arranging with some of the owners, it was not until the commencement of April last that the work of removing the houses, and constructing a roadway in their place, could be commenced. The work was performed by your own workmen, under my direction, and the cost was £407 13s 6d. The tramstones removed from the narrow portion of White Horse Lane, have been laid in Bancroft Place, and are of immense advantage to the traffic of that narrow thoroughfare. Crossings have been laid to facilitate and improve foot traffic at Garden Street, Stepney Green, Copley Street, Diggon Street, Oley Place, Tredegar Square, Bow Common Lane, Regent's Road, Raven Street, 6 King John Street, Grafton Street, Grove Road, Charles Street, Park Road, Burdett Road, and Grove Street. Unpaved Carriageways. The outlay for the maintenance of this description of roads has not been affected during the past year to a serious extent, owing to the Tramway Company's work; but the outlay for the current will be considerably reduced, about 1000 tons of granite being saved on the Mile End Road, and the work having supplied 312 yards of granite, and 1149 yards of gravel available for all gravel roads. The following is a list of the principal streets in the Hamlet, shewing the amount of material used in each street:— Gravel Granite Gravel Granite Alderney-road 10 Kirk's row 31 Burdett-road 6 23 Lichfield-road 211 37 Bow Common-lane. 6 50 Longfellow-road 85 Bedford-street 24 Mile End-road 491 781 Bancroft-road 27 17 New-street 27 Bancroft-place 10 Oxford-street 27 Beaumont-square 49 22 Patterson-street 74 Canal-road 17 164 St. Peter's-street 17 Charles-street 9 19 Stepney-green 15 184 Coborn-road 6 32 St. Peter's-road 16 Carlton-road 25 Philpot-street 199 Devonshire-street 24 67 St. Paul's-road 75 14 Devonport-street 5 Regent's-road 12 4 Diamond-row 96 7 Rhodeswell-road 1 60 Epping-place 17 Rutland-street 4 11 Grove-street 16 19 Robert-street 10 Gloucester-street 42 Sidney-street 239 Grafton-street 255 13 Tredegar-square 132 Grove-street 11 Union-street 2 70 Grove-road 21 Vincent-street 38 Gainsborough-road. 14 Westover-street 15 Heath-street 3 8 West-street 2 9 Emmott street 35 20 Wentworth-road 58 Hawkins-street 7 White Horse-lane 204 177 Jamaica-street 25 York-street 41 ROAD MATERIALS.

During the year, 16,480 feet superficial of new 3-in. paving have been laid in Mile End Road, Burdett Road, and Bridge Street, East, and 4,847 feet of old paving relaid in the Mile End Road; the total cost of which has been £606 16s. 10d. The work was executed under contract by Mr. Rutty. The old paving from Mile End Road has been laid in streets of less thoroughfare, and 10,000 feet of 2½-in. paving have been laid in various streets by your own workmen, the cost of which was £343. New Streets. During the year, you have paved and made up, at the cost of the owners of property, Edward's Road and Clinton Road, making an addition to the roads of the Hamlet of 1059 ft. lineal, equal to 42360 superficial feet. Scavenging. The arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway Company, which I reported to you last year, has worked most advantageously to the Vestry, during the whole of the year just ended. The cost of cartage has been £1015 19s or l/9½ per yd. That of loading into trucks 117 18s or 2½ „ £1133 17s The quantity removed from the roads was 11,223 yards, and that during the year 1869, 11,319 yards. Watering. During the year, the water carts were employed ninety-five days, at a cost of £481 6s 8d for horses and drivers, and £308 10s 3d for 7,555,000 gallons of water, supplied by the East London Water Company. 10 Lighting. The lighting of the Hamlet is still done by the Commercial Gas Company, who light at the present time 769 lamps. The total cost of public lighting, during the year, has been £3313 4s 6d; the contract price being £3 16s 8d per lamp per annum, including repairs. No complaint has reached the Vestry, during the year, of the quality or supply of the gas to private consumers. Sewers. New Sewers have been laid in Stepney-green; Johnstreet and Henry-street, Jubilee-street; and Sidney square. The cost of these works were £385 3s 4d. The following table will shew the length of each description of Sewer.

TRANSVERSE SECTION OF TRAMWAY I N MILE END ROAD. Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION & PUBLIC HEALTH OF Mile End Old Town, FOE THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1870. BY ' MATTHEW CORNER, Medical Officer of Health. london: Printed by THOS. PENNY & Co., LEMAN STREET, WHITECHAPEL. 1870. REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Fourteenth Annual Report of the sanitary condition and public health of the Hamlet for the year ending March, 1870. Births and Deaths. The total number of births was 3541, being 21 more than in the previous year. The birth-rate per 1000 of the population was 39.34, or nearly 4 per cent.; the rate for the whole Metropolis was 35.30, or 3.5 per cent. As shown in the Table, the excess of births over deaths was 1195. The total deaths were 2346, being 439 higher than the previous year, this excessive mortality is almost entirely attributable to the epidemic of scarlatina, which was extremely prevalent and fatal up to the end of last year. By Table No. 1, it will be seen that the deaths from infectious diseases were 264 above the average of five previous years, and that 216 or considerably more than a fourth, were from scarlatina alone. The various Tables appended to this Report, show the mortality during each quarter, the several causes of death, the various ages of persons at the period of death, and comparisons with previous years. The report of the Sanitary Inspector shows the number and nature of special sanitary works during the year, but exclusive of many which it is unnecessary to detail. In several cases unwholesome meat and fish have been condemned, and there were hundreds of cases of complaint of non-removal of dust. 4 Zymotic Diseases. The total number of deaths from zymotic diseases was 702, being 264 above the average of five previous years; this excess is almost entirely attributable to the fatal epidemic of scarlatina, which killed 216 persons during the year. The average number of deaths for ten previous years from this disease was 86. Small pox was exceptionally prevalent, and there were 43 deaths from this disease distributed through the Wards of the Hamlet as follows:— N. E. C. S. W. 5 25 12 1 0 This fact of the localization of the disease in the East and West Wards tends to show that close community of persons is necessary for the spread of the small pox by infection, the poison not being nearly so subtle and diffusive as that of scarlatina. Limitation of the spread of small pox by infection and its entire suppression, are, therefore, comparatively easy by means of early isolation, and the ordinary sanitary measures. Where sufficient isolation cannot be accomplished, as in the houses of the poor, all that is required is a suitable and convenient place for the reception of patients. The disease commenced in the East Ward, thence slowly extended into the adjoining Centre Ward, where it still prevails. In this limited epidemic, we have at once evidence both of the comparatively feeble propagating power of small pox by infection from person to person, and therefore of its easy control and suppression by the means indicated. 5 There are many difficulties to be overcome in carrying such necessary measures into effect. Next to the absence of proper places and accommodation for the reception of infectious diseases, there is in the majority of cases a great objection on the part of patients to removal from their homes, however miserable these may be, and however great the risk to their" own lives and others incurred by remaining therein. But with the present confused and impractical sanitary laws it is impossible to arrive at anything approaching sanitary perfection or complete suppression of infectious preventible disease. The following number of patients were sent by the Board of Guardians to the small pox and fever hospitals, during the year ending March, 1870:— Small pox 27 Fever 23 Total sent to hospitals 50 Ditto ditto previous year 107 The fever cases sent to hospital the previous year were 91 against 27 this year, and the small pox cases were 3 in the previous year against 23 this year. The fever cases thus showing a considerable decrease, and the small pox a considerable increase, but the aggregate of the two is less than half that of the previous year, the cost to the ratepayers would therefore be proportionately less. Of the 43 deaths from small pox, there were— Vaccinated 8 Not Vaccinated 25 Doubtful 10 6 Scarlet and Relapsing Fevers. I presentd a special Report to the Vestry in November last upon these epidemics, although it is very doubtful whether a single case of relapsing fever occurred" in this Hamlet. Scarlet fever was at the time very prevalent and fatal, but has gradually abated since December; there are, however, signs of a return of this prolonged and fatal epidemic, which, I repeat, can only be suppressed by such stringent measures, that it would be difficult to obtain authority for their adoption; yet how much more humane and charitable to terminate the pestilence by effectual measures, than to encourage its prolongation by mere temporising measures, which ensure little ultimate good. All that I have hitherto said as to the causes and spread of this disease has been confirmed by subsequent experience. Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Act. This Act has been enforced in the case of 10 houses in Eaton Place, Whitehorse Lane; structural alterations', as recommended by the Surveyor, being carried out, based upon my Report at the end of the previous year. 141 new houses were built in the Hamlet during the year ending March, 1870. Workshops' Regulations' Act. Several instances of infringement of this Act have been brought under my notice. The provisions of the Act were explained to the principals of the establishments, who expressed every desire to comply therewith. Printed instructions, explanatory of the requirements of the Act, were left at each establishment, for the information of the work-people. At an interview with the Government Inspector of Factories, he expressed to me his opinion that the local authority had no power to enter premises under this Act, unless formal complaint were made. 7 Sanitary Inspector's Report of List of Sanitary Works executed during the Year 1869—70. Houses and premises connected with new sewers 125 Old drains abolished 94 Traps provided to drains and closets 530 Houses cleansed and purified 108 Houses visited where disease has occurred and notices left, re contagious diseases 348 Foul drains cleansed 103 Dust bins provided 72 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 18 Premises from which pigs were removed 12 Yards repaved, &c. 62 Dung pits removed 4 In addition to the above, all the bakehouses have been visited twice during the year, and, where necessary, notices have been served to limewhite and cleanse. The slaughter houses and cow houses have also been visited, and various improvements carried out therein. There were no complaints of importance respecting manufactories, chemical works, &c. Gas. The gas supplied to this Hamlet by the Commercial Gas Company, has been, with regard to illuminating power, of about the average standard. The average illuminating power for the past year has been 14•7 candles against 14•4 in previous year. 8 Chemical Impurities. The quantity of ammonia rarely exceeds half a grain in 100 feet of gas, the maximum quantity allowed by Act of Parliament being five grains. The last testing (which can properly be included in this Report) showed .42 of a grain only in 100 cubic feet of gas. At the same period the sulphur tests gave the following results:— May 26, 1870, 19 grns. sulph. in 100 cubic it. gas. „ 27, ,, 26 „ 100 ,, „ 30, „ 19-8 „ 100 ,, Average quantity of sulphur 21-6 grains. With regard to the sulphur impurity, I may state that the difficulty to exclude it from gas is so great that the latest Act which applies to the City Gas Companies only, does not specify the maximum quantity of sulphur which may be present in gas, but leaves the quantity to be settled from time to time by the referees. The new apparatus at the local testing house is now complete. The photometer consists of Letheby's modification of Bunsen's, adapted for two candles instead of one as hitherto. The new apparatus for testing chemical impurities is now also complete; these have been supplied by the Commercial Gas Company at my suggestion. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, M. CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
