Analytical and Consulting Chemist (Part-time) 1 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM Mr. Mayor. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Annual Report on the health of the Borough for the year 1963. It has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/64. The estimated population increased by thr ee hundred and forty to seventy eight thousand, seven hundred and seventy. The birth rate was again higher at 15.64 births per thousand of population. As the comparability factor this year is 1.0 no adjustment is necessary and the figure compares with a birth rate of 14 99 (15.59 adjusted) in 1962. The birth rate in England and Wales was 18.2 per thousand. The death rate was higher before adjustment at 13.7 per thousand of population (12.95 in 1962) but after adjusting by a comparability factor of 0.87 was marginally lower at 11.93 (12,04). The death rate in England and Wales was 12.2 per thousand. The main causes of deaths were coronary and other heart disease, malignant neoplasms, and vascular lesions of the nervous system. During 1963 there were rather fewer deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus but more from cancer of the stomach and breast. There were two maternal deaths after four free years. The infantile mortality rate was also higher at 17.0 per thousand births in 1963, compared with 16.2 in 1962. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 20.9. Deaths from accidents in 1963 numbered twenty eight (twenty nine in 1962) of which twelve (seven) were due to motor vehicle accidents and nine (fourteen) to home accidents. There were nine deaths from suicide - a pleasing reduction of five over 1962. There was an increase in the number of cases of infectious disease, largely accounted for by the normal big increase in Measles which occurs every other year. There was no case of Diphtheria, and Poliomyelitis remained absent for the fifth successive year. The continued absence of these two serious diseases rests very definitely in the hands of all parents. It has long been realised that if seventy five per cent. of the children are immunised against Diphtheria, the disease does not spread, and if this percentage is applied to the country, the disease dies out. The success of the Poliomyelitis Vaccination campaign suggests a similar position in regard to Poliomyelitis, and with the easy to administer oral vaccine, I hope we can look forward to nearing a hundred per cent. protection of children and special groups. There was an unnotified death reported from Meningococcal Infection. There was no case of Typhoid Fever, but there was a small related group of Paratyphoid Fever cases. 2 The Borough's biggest problem, that of housing, has improved by the completion of thirty eight units during the year, and the Borough Engineer reports that a further two hundred and twenty two were under construction by the end of the year and should start to come into occupation in the later part of 1964. Planning for a further three hundred and ten units was also completed by the end of the year and planning approval was received for three hundred and fifty more. During 1963 the voluntary services in the Borough were extended by the opening of a social club for epileptics, which is held on Tuesday evenings at All Saints Church Hall, Stayton Road, Sutton. The new low level pumping station came into operation at Worcester Park Sewage Works and work is progressing on the generating station. Work on the relief sewer at Stayton Road and Stonecot Hill was completed and a start made on the relief surface water drainage in the Sutton Common area. The Sutton District Water Company celebrated its Centenary during 1963. The Water Engineer reported that the quantity of waters applied reached a new peak. The purity was maintained at the usual high standard. By the end of the year it was apparent that the question of Fluoridation of water supplies would be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the Watford case which is likely to be heard early in 1964. I am glad to be able to report that after an unfortunate delay, the task of cleaning the air we breathe in the Borough got under way early in the year. The Public Health Department staff was augmented by the appointment of a Technical Assistant to start the survey of the first two areas, which were completed and the necessary applications were passed to the Minister just before the end of the year. These two areas should come into operation on the 1st October 1964. The co-ordination of the development of the new Borough of Sutton proceeded following the formation of a Joint Committee of members of the three amalgamating authorities and the Surrey County Council. . A highlight in the history of the Borough occurred on May 20th when the Surrey Branch of the Royal Marsden Hospital was opened by Her Majesty the Queen. This new hospital of eighty five beds is the first stage in the development of a centre for the application of nuclear energy to medicine. Initially, the hospital will be a treatment centre for patients referred from the parent hospital in Fulham Road, from the special post-graduate group of teaching hospitals, and from hospitals and general practitioners in the Sutton area. The work of the sanitary supervision of the district and the protection of food and on clean air was efficiently carried out under the direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, whom I thank for his helpful collaboration and report. Much of the administrative work on Clean Air was undertaken by the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector, My thanks are also due to the inspectorial, clerical and outdoor staff of the Health Department. The work of the Department has again been facilitated by the continued co-operation from County staff at all levels, hospital and laboratory staff., and general practitioners working within the Borough, and that of the 3 Council Chief Officers and their staffs, from whom certain of the information used in this report has been received Lastly, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for the support given to myself and the Public Health Department during the year. I am, Mr Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN C. BIRCHALL, Medical Officer of Health. 4 SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR 1963 Area In acres 4338.15 Population: Registrar General's Estimate of the Resident Population (at 30th June 1963) 78,770 Census, 1961 79,008 Number of inhabited houses (end of year) according to the Rate Book 25,990 Rateable Value £4,514,677 Product of a Penny Rate £18,395 Males Females Total Live Births 635 597 1232 Legitimate 604 567 1171 Illegitimate 31 30 61 Illegitimate Live Births per cent. of total Live Births 4.95 Live Birth Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Resident Population : Crude 15.64 As adjusted by comparability factor (1.0) 15.64 (England and Wales 18.2 ) Still Births 6 10 16 Legitimate 6 10 16 Illegitimate 0 0 0 Still Birth Rate per 1000 total (live and still births) 12.82 (England and Wales 17.3 ) Deaths 512 568 1080 Death Rate per 1000 of the Estimated Resident Population: Crude 13.7 As adjusted by comparability factor (0.87) 11.93 (England and Wales 12.2 ) Deaths from Sepsis 0 Other Maternal Causes 2 Death Rate from Maternal Causes per 1000 total (live and still births) 1.60 (England and Wales 0.28) Deaths of Infants under one year of age: All Infants per 1000 live births 17.0 (England and Wales 20.9 ) Legitimate Infants per 1000 legitimate live births 17.9 Illegitimate Infants per 1000 illegitimate live births 0 Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (under 4 weeks) 13.0 (England and Wales 14.2 ) Early Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (under 1 week) 10.6 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Still births + deaths under 1 week) per 1000 total live and still births 23.2 5 CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM DURING 1963 M.

The Act comes into operation on 1st January 1964. (C) The Animals (Cruel Poisons) Act, 1962 This Act came into operation on 1st January 1963 and is an Act to prohibit the killing of animals by cruel poisons and gives power to the Secretary of State to make Regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of poisons. (D) Food and Drugs Act, 1955 (1) The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963 These regulations re-enact with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The principal changes are that on and after 1st October 1964, (1) The designation "Untreated" replaces "Tuberculin Tested" for row milk. (ii) Methylene Blue Test replaces the "Clot on Boiling Test". (2) The Bread and Flour Regulations, 1963 These regulations prescribe permitted ingredients for white bread, brown bread, or wheat meal bread, wheat germ bread, wholemeal bread and soda bread and requirements as to the composition of bread containing milk solids or added protein. They impose requirements as to labelling and advertising of the aforementioned breads.

These regulations come into operation on 1st September, 1964. (3) The Liquid Egg (Pasteurisation) Regulations, 1963 These regulations require the pasteurisation of liquid egg to be used in food intended for sale for human consumption, other than egg broken out on the food manufacturer's premises and used within twenty four hours. The regulations prescribe the method of pasteurisation and the test to be satisfied The regulations come into operation on 1st January 1964. 8 (4) The Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963 These regulations revoke and re-enact with amendments the Public Health (Meat) Regulations 1924 to 1952 The object of the regulations is to obtain one hundred per cent inspection of meat at slaughter houses. The regulations came into operation on 1st October, 1963 HEALTH EDUCATION Health education continued during the year as part of the normal duties of all members of the staff during their routine visits and day to day work In addition, the following special subjects were dealt with:- (i) Talks The Medical Officer of Health gave a talk to the Sutton and Cheam Society on the Public Health Department in Action, and held a discussion on health with a ladies' political group. Talks on Health In Retirement were given to a women's organisation and to an old people s association. (ii) Smoking and Lung Cancer During the year efforts continued to stress the dangers to health of cigarette smoking. Several posters supplied by the Ministry of Health were widely distributed to public notice boards, public offices, hospitals, medical practitioners, and numerous local organisations. A bookmark was distributed through the Public Libraries. Posters were also displayed at the Civic Exhibition held at the Public Halls in May. Posters specially directed towards school children and young people were distributed in schools, youth clubs and clinics by the Divisional Medical Officer. A mobile anti smoking unit paid visits to Sutton West County Secondary Boys' School, St. Barnabas Youth Cluband The Ridge Youth Club, Sutton Common Road, in January, The most important thing is to persuade the youth of the country of these dangers in order that they will not start smoking or will give it up before the habit becomes strong This is the responsibility of parents, doctors teachers, and indeed all adults who have contact with children. The best teaching is by example. Anti-smoking clubs have reported on the apparent ease with which some lifelong smokers of twenty to thirty, and even thirty to forty cigarettes a day have succeeded in giving up the habit. The main reguirement is for a group of friends keen to give up smoking to meet together and discuss their mutual problems and individual difficulties at least weekly. It is becoming noticeable that a gradual change of social climate is occurring; from cigarette smoking being the 'done thing' it is slowly becoming socially less acceptable I think this is a most encouraging sign and indicates the way in which the steady decline in the number of smokers will occur in the coming years as the number of non-smoking families increases. (iii) Vaccination and Immunisation The London and Home Counties two weeks' Campaign to boost Vaccination and Immunisation was supported locally during the weeks commencing 23rd September and 30th September 1963, by the distribution of a poster and also of leaflets via the Libraries and Public Health Department, and by a letter to the Press, Posters were also displayed at the Civic Exhibition held at the Public Hall, Sutton, in May 9 (iv) Articles Articles were written by the Medical Officer of Health in a Ratepayers' Gazette on 'Smoke Pollution and Smog' and 'Rabies' (v) Home Safety During 1963 nine people died in the Borough following accidents in the home In addition, one hundred and nineteen people were removed to hospital by Surrey County Council Ambulances following home accidents fifty seven following falls thirty four suffering from poisoning, seven following burns and scalds, eleven suffering from cuts one child suffering from choking and nine following other types of home accidents The Sutton and Cheam Home Safety Committee was very active during the year under the lead of its President, Alderman Mrs D. Sparks M.B.E new Chairman,. Mr. H. Halls, and Secretary Mrs. I.L Ashmore, 243 Brighton Road, Belmont (Tel Vigilant 5474). In February the Committee invited the Home Safety Committees of neighbouring authorities in Surrey to an informal Home Safety Conference, which proved so successful and enjoyable that it is likely robe repeated next year with another authority acting as host. The highlight of the year was the provision and manning of a Home Safety stall in the Civic Exhibition in the Public Halls in May. The stall, besides its various interesting displays and teaching aids, distributed leaflets on all aspects of Home Safety. Crossword puzzle competitions were run. Many questions from the public were answered and altogether the stall was useful in publicising the Committee's existence and work Speakers were provided to interested organisations and groups, and posters, leaflets, etc were distributed on many aspects of Home Safety Towards the end of the year arrangements were started to meet our counterparts in the other divisions of Borough 21, with a view to considering the form of future integration and co-ordination. This had already been started by close co-operation in assisting at each other's exhibitions The local Press co-operated well in giving publicity to the work of the Committee and in publishing local Home Accident figures when available Special Home Safety notices or slogans were inserted in two local papers monthly during the first four months of the year following on a preChristmas insertion in December 1962 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS One hundred and twenty seven medical examinations of staff were undertaken during the year, consisting of one hundred and nine for superannuation purposes and eighteen sick pay cases for reports to the Establishment Committee. 10 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 and 1951 Section 47 (Removal of Persons in Need of Care and Attention) (a) Two persons a man and wife, both in the middle seventies, were removed to an Old People's Home under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 They had been brought to my notice in September 1962 by relatives. Close contact was maintained with them and their own doctor until it was considered impossible for them to continue to live on their own An Order was sought and made in February 1963. Ten old persons were brought to notice for the first time during the year, and of these, one died at home (within days of coming to notice end before action could be taken), eight managed at home, some with varying types of statutory and voluntary assistance, and one was admitted to hospital and died during the year, Twenty old people continued to be followed up from previous years, and of these, six were removed to hospital, of whom four died during the year, and one was later transferred to an Old People's Home. One was admitted to an Old People's Home, one went to live with relatives, and twelve continued to live at home, of whom one died during the year. (b) General Local Health Authority Services, such as the District Nursing and Home Help Services, help to keep old people in their own homes as long as possible. In addition, the Old People's Welfare Committee of the Council of Social Service also do a great deal to help old people remain in their homes as long as possible They provide Meals on Wheels, and a visiting service for old people, which it is hoped will be expanded. They also run a chiropody service for old people, the cost of which is reimbursed by the Surrey County Council The severe winter at the beginning of 1963 put a great strain on elderly people, especially those living alone Lack of fuel through difficulties of distribution causedby road conditions caused danger to life as well as causing frozen pipes, frozen toilets, etc. Shopping for food was also difficult and dangerous The Old People's Welfare Committee arranged to have a stock of fuel available should similar conditions apply in future years. Subscriptions were being received at the end of the year for the proposed new Housing Society, end a Housing Committee will come into being early in 1964. Visits were paid by members of the Old People's Welfare Committee to a Day Centre for Old People with a view to assisting in planning a new Day Centre locally. At the end of the year a Bedford utility brake was purchased to assist in the transport of elderly and handicapped persons and will come into use in January 1964, 11 A Kitchen at the W.V.S premises. 18 Grove Road Sutton was being re-equipped at the end of the year and will be run by the W.V.S for the Old People's Welfare Committee, and will enable the number of meals on wheels to be doubled It is hoped it will come into operation early in 1954. Section 60 (Burial ar,d Cremation of the Dead) Three burials were arranged under the powers granted to the Council by this Section. MORTUARY During 1963, two hundred and fifteen bodies were admitted and underwent post mortem examination Seventy six of the bodies were admitted from hospitals and sixteen from other local authority areas. Difficulties in staffing the Mortuary, reported in 1962, increased, and it was decided to appoint a full time attendant who took up his duties early in August. The appointment has proved very beneficial, and the conditions and standard maintained at our new Mortuary must be as high as any to be found in the country. The most desirable improvement still awaited is the provision of a house near to the Mortuary for the attendant LABORATORIES The Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, served the Borough for bacteriological examinations. This service is supplemented by the use of the laboratories at Sutton and Cheam Hospital and St. Helier Hospital Approximately nine hundred and seventy nine specimens connected with infectious diseases were submitted to the laboratories during the year CLINICS Details of the clinics available in the district are given at the end of this report (Pages 59 and 60). SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply. The water supply is mainly derived from the deep wells in the chalk of the Sutton District Water Company situated at Sutton, Cheam and Woodmansterne. A small area in the North Ward is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board The water from all the wells of the Sutton District Water Company is softened to under nine degrees of hardness A high dose of chlorine in the form of chloramine is administered to the water as a protective measure. Most of it is removed later, leaving a small residual chloramine to pass out to public distribution The water is not liable to be plumbo-solvent. The fluoride content is reported to be less than 0 1 part per million. 12 Samples of the raw and treated waters are examined daily by the laboratory at the Sutton Works. Samples are also examined at monthly intervals by the Company's Consultant Analyst, and copies of his reports are received. Twenty four bacteriological and twelve chemical samples are taken annually by the five District Councils in the area of supply (two bacteriological and one chemical per month, in rotation). All samples were satisfactory. The supply from all sources has been satisfactory in guality and quantity As regards the latter, the Water Engineer reports that the quantity supplied by the Sutton District WaterCompany in 1963 was the highest ever, just over thirty gallons per head of population per day being supplied for domestic use and eight gallons per head per day for industrial use. There were no restrictions on supply throughout the year, as indeed has been the case throughout the hundred years' existence of the Company, which held its Centenary Celebrations in June. No action was necessary in respect of contamination during the year. All the dwelling houses have a direct supply from the public mains, as follows (a) Twenty six thousand, two hundred and eighty six houses, with a population of seventy eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty two, are supplied to a tap directly into the house. (b) Five houses, with a population of eight, are supplied by stand-pipes, The Sutton District Water Company supply twenty five thousand, eight hundred and forty eight dwellings, and the remaining four hundred and thirty eight dwellings are supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. The following is an average monthly analysis:- Chemical Results in Parts per Million Average Appearance Bright with a slightly white deposit of minute particles of calcium carbonate. Turbidity Less than 3 Colour Nil Odour Normal pH 8.5 Free Carbon Dioxide Absent Electric Conductivity 290 Dissolved Solids dried at 180° C. 210 Chlorine present as Chloride 19 Alkalinity as Calcium Carbonate 55 Hardness (grains per gallon)- Carbonate 3.9 Non-carbonate 4.2 Total 8.1 Nitrate Nitrogen 11 Nitrite Nitrogen Less than 0.01 Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.14 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.000 Oxygen Absorbed 0.20 Residual Chlorine 0.19 Metals - Iron, Zinc, Copper, Lead Absent 13 Bacteriological Results No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. 1 day at 37° c. 0 No. of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 2 days at 37° C. 0 No of colonies developing on Agar per ml. for 3 days at 20-22° C 0 Presence of Bacillus Coli in 100 ml. 0 Swimming Baths. There are two public swimming baths in Sutton and Cheam The Maiden Road Bath Cheam, was opened in 1938, and so is reasonably modern. It is open between April and September, and in Winter it is convened into a fine public hall. The Throwley Road Bath, Sutton, is much older and has changing cubicles round the sides of the bath, It is open all the year round. Malden Boad Bath Throwley Road Bath Maximum Clothes Accommodation 312 250 Quantity of Water 150,000 gallons 70,000 gallons Treatment Cycle Time 3/4 hours 3'A hours Both work on a continuous cycle of pressure filtration and chlorination, the actual water being emptied out once a year and the Baths being filled with mains water. Records are kept at both Baths showing the number of bathers, water temperature and residual chlorine levels at various times during the day and from these it was clear that an adequate degree of chlorination was being maintained. Four bacteriological samples were taken from the Maiden Road Bath and five from the Throwley Road Bath. All nine samples were reported as satisfactory In addition, there is an open air learner swimming bath at Avenue Road County Primary School, Belmont Rise., Belmont. A small pressure filter and chlorinator was in use and a complete circulation of water was obtained every eight hours. Three samples of the water were taken for bacteriological examination, and were found to be satisfactory. DRAINAGE SEWERAGE AND REFUSE COLLECTION I am indebted to the Borough Engineer and Surveyor for supplying information for items (a) to (d) following. (a) Worcester Park Sewage Works The new Low Level Pumping Station came into operation in July, together with the Preliminary Treatment Unit and Rising Mains associated with the Station. The Pumping Station, which is working very satisfactorily is dependent upon a supply from the Electricity Board for a time until the Generating Station which is now being constructed is operational. 14 Two Contracts have been let for construction of Sludge Drying Beds and the first section of these beds will be in use by the Spring of 1964. A Contract has also been let for the reconstruction of the Filter Beds and additional Humus Tanks and work was commenced in October and will last approximately two years. Daring the period up to October, the effluent being discharged to the Beverley Brook was of reasonable quality but there has been a slight deterioration since the Filter Bed and Humus Tank Contract, as an area of filter beds has had to be demolished prior to construction of the new Filter Beds. (b) Sutton Sewage Works During the year, minor improvements have been made to the Treatments Units generally. The effluent discharged to the Pyl Brook is normally of good quality. (c) Drainage During the year work has been completed on the construction of relief sewers at Stayton Road and Stonecot Hill and a start was made on the first section of the Sutton Common Area Relief Surface Water Drainage Scheme. (d) Refuse Collection and Cleansing The scheme which commenced in 1960 for the haulage of refuse from the areas of both Mitcham and Sutton and Cheam Councils, via the Refuse Transfer Station in Oldfields Road, Sutton, to the controlled tip at Buckland, has proceeded reasonably satisfactorily throughout the year. (e) Closet Accommodation There is only one cesspool in use in the Borough, and one septic tank. Since 1928, one hundred and sixty three premises, originally with cesspool drainage, have been connected to sewers. Only two pail closets and three chemical closets are in use, not including those in temporary use on new building sites. (f) Rivers and Streams The streams within the Borough have been maintained in a satisfactory condition. 15 SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA Report of the Chief Public Health Inspector under Regulation 25(20) of the Public Health Officers Regulations 1959 (Pages 16 to 47) RECORD OF INSPECTIONS MADE, COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATED AND NOTICES SERVED Visits Advisory: Housing & Public Health: Special Inspections 1,366 Bakehouses 12 Butchers: Grocers: Greengrocers: Fishmongers etc 848 Cinemas: theatres, halls 2 Clean Air Act: Smoke observations: Deposit gauges: Volumetric, enquiries etc. 466 Clean Air Act, Smoke Control Areas - Survey visits 3,448 Dairies: Milk Purveyors 45 Factories: Workplaces 283 Food & Drugs Act sampling 176 Food Poisoning enquiries 4 Hairdressers: Barbers premises 34 Heating Appliances (Consumers Protection Act, 1961) 3 Hospitals: Schools - spraying of kitchens 4 Houses in multiple occupation 84 Ice Cream: Manufacture, storage and sale of 95 Ice Cream sampling (Bacteriological) 137 Infectious Diseases 433 Licensed Public Houses 9 Merchandise Marks Act 126 Milk: Water sampling (Bacteriological) 139 Miscellaneous 3,687 Noise Nuisances - Investigations 48 Outworkers premises 61 Overcrowding: Permitted numbers 282 Pet Animals Act 3 Rag Flock Act - He-inspections 2,499 Restaurants: Cafe Kitchens: Dining Rooms etc. 69 Rodent Control Inspections 7,123 School and Public conveniences 38 Schools: Industrial Canteen Kitchens 42 Shops under Shops Act 514 Spraying of premises - various insect pests 6 Stables: Passages: Piggeries: Ditches 103 Verminous premises 8 Total 21,597 Number of complaints received and investigated 729 Premises at which defects or nuisances were discovered 2,118 Number of defects or nuisances discovered 2,686 „ „ „ „ „ remedied 2,380 „ „ „ „ „ in hand 152 „ „ „ „ „ outstanding 154 Number of informal notices served 290 Statutory Notices were served as under:- Public Health Act, 1936, Section 24 49 „ „ „ „ „ 39 - „ „ „ „ „ 45 - „ „ „ „ „ 75 1 „ „ „ 1961 „ 17 1 Sutton & cheam Corporation Act 1951 - Section 42 Total 51 16 SUMMARY OF REMEDIAL WORKS AND SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT Drainage and Sanitary Fittings:- Number of houses and other premises redrained 1 Number of houses and other premises connected to soil and/or surface water sewers - Repairs and amendments to existing drains (1,179 feet laid) 48 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed (involving 1,559 premises) 703 Sanitary fittings repaired/renewed/provided or cleansed 561 Water service pipes/cisterns/repaired/renewed or cleansed 10 Water, smoke and chemical tests applied 171 W C.

Grants for the Improvement or Conversion of Houses Section 20 of the Housing Act, 1949 empowered local authorities to make grants at their discretion for the improvement of dwellings by the provision of certain amenities. The Borough Council decided to operate the scheme in October, 1954 Section 30 of the Housing Act, 1961 alters the circumstances in which improvement grants and standard grants may be made under Part 11 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958 and the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959. 19 The following is a summary of applications for grants received and dealt with by the Borough Council up to 31st December, 1963, as supplied ay the Town Clerk:– Applications Received Discretionary Conversions Standard Total From inception of the scheme to 31st December, 1963 242 35 151 428 During 1963 30 4 55 89 Withdrawn, ineligible or not granted From inception 37 16 27 80 During 1963 6 1 10 17 Approved From inception 199 19 119 337 During 1963 24 4 44 72 Outstanding at 31st December, 1963 2 0 2 4 Total grants paid to 31st December, 1963 £42,696 l1s. 10d.

The main effect of the Act was to free from rent control houses and flats with rateable values exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District, and the City of London, or over £30 elsewhere in England and Wales, and to allow limited increases in the rents of houses and flats still under rent control. The following summary shews the number of applications received for 'Certificates of Disrepair', and for the cancellation thereof during the period 6th July, 1957 to 31st December, 1963.

Nine complaints of smoke emission were received and dealt with during the year, six of these were in respect of bonfires, one in respect of a domestic chimney, and two from industrial plants. Grit Deposit Measuring Gauges In conjunction and with the co-operation of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the grit deposit measuring gauges have been maintained-and samples collected monthly for analytical examination. The Borough is adequately covered by three grit deposit gauges which are sited roughly IV2 miles apart. The following is a summary of the results obtained during the year:– MONTH Gauge Rainfall in inches No. 2 Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Gauge Rainfall in inches No. 6 Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) Gauge Rainfall in inches No. 7 Total Solids (Tons per sq. mile) January 1.50 23.82 0.71 14.75 1.30 16.31 February 0.47 12.78 0.39 7.51 0.43 10.31 March 3.27 17.02 3.78 10.14 3.15 13.60 April 2.60 13.17 2.84 13.04 2.28 9.66 May 1.77 11.04 1.81 8.91 1 66 7.23 June 1.50 9.41 1.34 7.23 1.26 7.26 July 1.34 6.26 1.50 4.58 1.22 5.10 August 3.78 8.72 3.62 5.40 3.31 5.51 September 1.89 9.51 2.09 6.59 1.89 5.33 October 1.50 5.23 1.69 9.09 1.42 4.56 November 3.90 9.32 3.86 7.55 3.86 8.37 December 0.55 7.15 0.67 11.32 0.59 11.24 Yearly Totals 24.07 133.43 24.30 106.11 22.37 104.48 Monthly Average 1963 2.0 11.12 2.02 8.84 1.86 8.70 1962 1.81 10.57 1.97 10.30 1.80 7.47 1961 1.90 9.39 2.01 7.70 1.75 6.98 1960 2.59 10.62 2.79 10.77 2.44 8.97 22 DAILY MEAN CONCENTRATION OF SMOKE AND SULPHER DIOXIDE A daily record has been kept since the 1st November, 1958 of the amount of smoke or suspended matter and sulphur dioxide in the air by means of a smoke filter and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus installed in Manor Park House, It has long been recognised that a distinction must be drawn between relatively coarse particles of solid matter which are quickly deposited by their own weight, and which comprise most of the particulate matter collected in the deposit gauge, and the very fine particles which settle slowly, if at all. These fine particles, commonly referred to as 'smoke', are less than about 20 microns (0.002 cm) in size and consist largely of carbonaceous matter, including tar, produced by the incomplete combustion of coal; some fine ash is also included. It is important to realise that little of this fine material is collected in the deposit gauge which in consequence gives no information about pollution by smoke. To obtain such information a smoke filter is necessary. The following table gives a summary of the daily readings taken during the year 1963:– Smoke Concentration (Microgrammes per cu. metre) Sulphur Dioxide Concentration (Microgrammes per cu.metre) Highest Daily Reading Lowest Daily Reading Average Daily Reading Highest Daily Reading Lowest Daily Reading Average Daily Reading January 659 63 186 778 144 270 February 304 58 156 392 63 204 March 97 11 41 766 25 115 April 111 10 47 283 19 95 May 52 7 21 65 15 36 June 65 3 20 140 6 54 July 39 5 13 93 7 24 August 35 4 13 73 2 19 September 64 7 32 199 7 48 October 130 8 37 330 12 71 November 166 2 38 430 24 44 December 344 32 140 503 56 279 Whole year: 1963 659 2 62 778 2 105 1962 1660 2 81 1400 6 l l1 1961 1184 1 59.5 1244 3 107 23 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS In June, 1962, the Minister of Housing and Local Government stated that in view of the density of residential property in the Borough and ts nearness to London, the Borough of Sutton and Cheam should be regarded as a 'Black Area' for the purpose of Circular No. 4/62. The initial survey of all properties in the Proposed No. 1 and No. 2 Smoke Control Areas wcs completed by the 13th September, 1963. (a) The Sutton and Cheam (No. 1) Smoke Control Order, 1963, was made by the Borough Council on the 24th day of September, 1963, and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. When confirmed the Order will come into operation on the 1st October, 1964, or on a later date determined, by the Minister. The area consists of all buildings (except certain exempted premises) within a section of the Borough, comprising 307 acres and enclosed by the following boundaries:- "The Borough boundary line commencing at the Pyl Brook along utonecot Hill, Lpsom Road, £lm Road West, Sutton Common Recreation Ground, Morden Way, Wimbledon branch railway to Reigate Avenue Railway Bridge along the north side of Reigate Avenue and Oldfields Road to the Pyl Brook, continuing northerly along the Pyl Brook perimeter of the Sutton Sewage Disposal Works to Stonecot Hill" Premises included in the Area are as foliows:– Industrial premises 14 Commercial premises 105 Dwellings (including 86 Council owned dwellings) 1784 Other premises 15 Total 1918 (b) The Sutton and Cheam (No.2) Smoke Control Order, 1963, was made by the Borough Council on the 23rd October, 1963, and submittedto the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation.

The ingredients specified on the label did not comply with the reguirements of the Labelling of Food Order 1953 After consultation the importers arranged with the American producers to have new labels printed which complied with the Order. 3343 (Informal) Seasoned Salt Sample contained a small proportion of an antioxidant (B.H.T.). This substance is not permitted in this article. The American manufacturers arranged to produce this article for export to this Country without antioxidants 3346 (Informal) Hamburger Relish Labelling The ingredients as specified on the label included 'Vinegar' and 'edible gum'. These are generic and not specific names or descriptions and do not comply with the reguirements of the Labelling of Food Order 1953 The Canadian expor'ers gave an assurance that future shipments to the United Kingdom would be correctly labelled. 3347 (Informal) Sweet Relish Labelling The ingredients of this article as specified on the label included 'Vinegar' but vinegar is a generic and not a specific name or description and is not an appropriate designation for the purpose of the Labelling of Food Order 1953. An assurance was given by the Canadian exporters that all future shipments to the United Kingdom would be . labelled using specific and not generic terms. 3357 (Informal) Cherry Pie Filling Labelling One ingredient was specified as "Vegetable Gum". This is a generic and not a specific name or description as reguired by the Labelling of Food Order 1953 Matter amicably settled by the Canadian manufacturers having new labels printed which complied with the Order. 29 Sample No. Article Sampled Type of Infringement Action Taken 3373 (Informal) Pure Lemon Juice (Calif ornian) This article was submitted for examination at the request of a resident who complained it contained dark specks. The Public Analyst reported that the article contained dissolved tin to the extent of 60 p.p.m. and was unfit for sale The Californian Canners stated that the can had been filled over 18 months ago and that the deterioration shown by the condition of the can was greater than normal, probably due to poor storage conditions A further check sample taken proved to be satisfactory. 3384 (Informal) Minced Beef with onion and gravy This article contained only 41 per cent of meat,, whereas in the opinion of the Public Analyst it should contain not less than 50 per cent of meat The manufacterer wrote stating that the meat content of this article had recently been raised to 50 per cent. 3394 (Informal) Orange Nectar sweetened The Public Analyst reported that this article consisted of orange juice and crushed orange diluted with water and with sugar and citric • acid added He was of the opinion that it was misleading to describe this article as "Pure Orange Juice and crushed orange" without any indication that it was diluted with water. The importers submitted an amended label from the Spanish canners which was better than the former one, but still not free from criticism. Negotiations are still proceeding and had not been concluded at the year end. . Sampling Observations It will be' seen from the detailed classification that of the two hundred and twenty three samples taken during the year the Public Analyst reported five labelling infringements (2.24 per cent) and four samples for other types of irregularities (1.79 per cent) a total of 9 (4.03 per cent). The pattern of sampling has followed that of previous years in that a wide range and variety of articles have been selected for analysis and it is worthy of mention that the infringements found were on the whole of a minor character and amicably settled without recourse to legal proceedings. 30 Public Analyst's Comments, 1963 The year 1963 has been one of considerable activity amongst public analysts and although these new activities may not have applied specifically to many of the samples examined for Sutton and Cheam it is rewarding to know that efforts to protect the consumer in one part of Surrey or, in fact in one part of England, automatically protects the consumer in general. For this reason, in these notes, I have no hesitation in writing about what we have been doing in general terms in the knowledge that in the long run everyone benefits. First, there is the work which we started in 1962 and which has been continued and extended in 1963 to develop and maintain a colony of a particular species of fly to act as a biological test for the possible presence of certain pesticide residues in food arising from the widespread use of sprays and dusts in agriculture. The various chemicals so used are not liable to leave any significant residue if the instructions for use issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are obeyed, but the toxicity of some of these chemicals is so great that the added confidence provided by the use of the 'fly' test, amongst others, is one which the public analyst can help to provide. Probably the greatest risk is with raw foods such as fruit and vegetables and all such samples are tested where appropriate by this test and others to establish that the residue is either absent or well below a safe limit. Briefly, an extract of the food is made with a suitable organic solvent, the solvent is removed and a number of flies are 'exposed' to this extract and a count is made of the living flies after a time of anything up to 2 days. The most potent'insecticides act on contact and the flies do not necessarily 'feed' on the extract. An abnormally high death rate of flies calls for further investigation. No positive test was recorded on numerous samples of human food tested during the year. A second danger which has been receiving our attention is that of the presence of penicillin or other antibiotics in milk. This arises from the use of penicillin to 'cure' mastitis in cows, high concentrations being injected into the udder. The milk from such cows is not supposed to be used for human consumption until at least 48 hours after, but there is a risk of it being sold before this time has elapsed. In my laboratory all samples of milks direct from the farm are subjected to a test designed to detect very small amounts of penicillin. Here again, in that part of the year since the test was applied no very significant quantity of penicillin has been detected in any one sample, but the time will probably come when it will be considered an offence to have even a trace of penicillin in milk. Thirdly, much more attention has been paid to samples of modern drugs in recent months, not because we have any reason to doubt their quality or purity, their manufacture normally being in the hands of people of high integrity and repute, but because it is considered to be the duty of the public analyst under the Food and Drugs Act to keep a watch on these matters. Considerable confusion has arisen, particularly as a result of the thalidomide affair, and it has been implied that Food and Drugs Authorities and their public analysts have not been doing the work of enforcement with which they have been entrusted. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the safety of drugs as such when used for a medical purpose is one which must be decided by medical authority as a result of extensive clinical 31 trials and pharmacological research and is not our business. However, once the drug is on the market it is the responsibility of Food and Drugs Authorities to ensure that its quality and purity is maintained. This we accept and it is our aim to cover' all drugs in modern usage, provided adequate sampling is carried out, to ensure that the public do not stand risk of injury to health or prejudice due to the drug not being of its proper nature, substance or quality. During the year there has been a revision of the Soft Drinks Regulations, but the revised Regulations do not come into force until July, 1964 They have been disappointing. In my opinion the only satisfactory way of ensuring that the public are not misled in their purchase of the various drinks on the market is to have a stipulation that the fruit juice content or fruit content is stated on the label, but the Ministry has not accepted this. How many people know that an orange drink, often described as a whole orange drink, need contain no more than 2% of potable fruit! And nothing can be done about it. Similarly if an article is labelled Blackcurrant Syrup it must contain about 40 per cent of blackcurrant juice, whereas by putting in a little less sugar and calling it blackcurrant drink, even although it may have the same vitamin C content, it need and usually does only contain 10 per cent of blackcurrant juice. These are anomalies which are carried forward under the new Regulations. Fortunately an illustration of a label which your Authority was able to put right and reported by the Chief Public Health Inspector was the case of 'Sweetened Orange Nectar Pure Orange Juice and Crushed Oranges' which was found to contain nearly two thirds added water. MILK SUPPLY Food and Drugs Act, 1955 The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, .1860 The Borough of Sutton and Cheam is a specified area for the purpose of the Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order 1951, therefore all milk sold in the Borough is designated Milk. , The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 came into force on the 1st January, 1961 in respect to dealers' licences, These regulations consolidated and re-enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 to 1954 and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953, The principal changes are:– (a) Dealer's licences (except for a few kinds granted by the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food) are granted by the food and drugs authority for the area within which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is pasteurised, sterilised, or sold, as the case may be; dealers' licences permit sales outside as well as inside the area of the licensing authority, and supplementary licences are now discontinued. 32 (b) A dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence has been introduced which permits the sale of all three kinds of specially designated milk, where the milk is obtained by the dealer in the container in which it is to be supplied to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer. (c) The period for which a dealer's licence will be granted has been extended from one year to five years. All milk distributors in the Borough are licenced to use the special designation in relation to the milk retailed. Routine inspections of the milk pasteuriser's and distributor's premises reveal that the provisions of the regulations are generally well observed. Four licences were issued in 1963, authorising the use of Special Designations and these will expire on the 31st December, 1965 along with previous licences issued from 1961 onwards (as mentioned in (c) above). The total now issued being 55 as follows:– 1961 1962 1963 Total Dealer's pre-packed Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised and Sterilised 27 – 2 29 Tuberculin Tested and Pasteurised 1 – – 1 Tuberculin Tested 1 – – 1 Pasteurised and Sterilised 2 1 – 3 Pasteurised 3 2 1 6 Sterilised 11 1 1 13 Dealer's Tuberculin Tested 1 – – 1 Dealer's Pasteuriser's 1 – – 1 Total 47 4 4 55 BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES One hundred and three samples of milk were examined as follows Class of Milk Number of samples examined Type of Test applied Results Passed Failed Void Pasteurised 57 Phosphatase 57 – – Methylene Blue 57 – – Sterilised 3 Turbidity 3 – – Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 21 Phosphatase 21 – – Methylene Blue 21 – – Tuberculin Tested .

The Methylene Blue test shall be begun between 9.30 a.m. and 10,0 a.m. on the day after the sample is taken, but the test shall NOT be applied if during the period of storage at atmospheric shade temperature this temperature at any time exceeds 70°F, The test shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which fails to decolourise methylene blue in thirty minutes. Six samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) Milk failed the test. The dairy companies concerned were notified immediately of the failures in order that the matter could be taken up with the responsible producers as speedily as possible The 'Phosphatase' test for Pasteurised Milk shall be deemed to be satisfied by milk which gives a reading of 10 ug or less of p-nitrophenol/ml of milk Seventy eight samples were subjected to this test and found to be satisfactory. CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF MILK AND CREAM SAMPLES MILK Forty-two formal and twenty-five informal samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis: all were found to be genuine Seventeen samples of 'Channel Island' milk contained satisfactory averages of 4 64% milk fat and 8.99% milk solids other than milk fat; fifty other samples of milk contained satisfactory averages of 3 66% milk fat and 8.71% milk solids other than milk fat The results were well above the minimum standard of 4% milk fat laid down in the Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations 1956; and of 3% milk fat and 8.5% milk solids other than milk fat required under The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. 34 CREAM Analysis of eleven informal samples of cream showed three double cream samples to contain an average of 49.93% milk fat and eight single cream samples a satisfactory average of 23.7% milk fat. The minimum standards in relation to cream are as follows:- 'double cream' not less than 48% by weight of milk fat; and 'other creams' described as single cream, pouring cream, coffee cream, fruit cream, or as any other description of cream - not less than 18% by weight of milk fat ICE CREAM Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, 1959 Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 Registrations: During the year five applications for the registration of premises for the sale and storage of ice cream were received and granted. At the end of 1963 a total of one hundred and eighty five premises had been registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, and on three of these premises ice cream could be manufactured. BACTERIOLOGICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM During the year sixty-eight samples of ice cream were obtained for bacteriological examination and provisional grading. The following table shows the 1963 percentage results in each grade and for comparative purposes the results obtained in 1962.

CHEMICAL SAMPLING OF ICE CREAM The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 came into operation on the 27th April, 1959, andreplaced the Order of 1953. The Regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and for "Parev" (kosher) ice and introduce separate standards for dairy ice cream (or dairy cream ice or cream ice) and for milk ice. The standards for dairy ice cream and for milk ice provide that they shall contain no fat other than milk fat except such as may be introduced by the use of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent. The requirement in the 1953 Order that ice cream should contain not less than 10% of sugar is replaced by a provision that no type of ice cream shall contain any artificial sweetener. Alternative standards are prescribed for certain descriptions of ice cream containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree. The standard of composition for ice cream is as follows;- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5% fat and 7/4% milk solids other than fat. (b) Ice cream containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall either conform to (a) above or, alternatively the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½% of the whole including the fruit etc. and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½% fat and 2% milk solids other than fat. (c) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice, or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5% milk fat and no other fat (except as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7½% milk solids other than fat. 36 (d) Milk Ice or Milk Ice containing fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree shall contain not less than 2½% milk fat and no other fat (save as mentioned in second paragraph above), and not less than 7% milk solids other than fat. 13 samples of locally produced ice cream were submitted to chemical examinaticn during the year and found to contain constituent percentages above the prescribed standard, as unden:– Constituent Percentages Sample No. Fat Milk Solids other than fat 3295 10. 6 13.5 3302 5.6 8.5 3321 5.3 9.0 3349 6.2 9.6 3365 5.0 9.5 3366 11.0 13.0 3382 6.4 9.0 3395 5.4 9.0 3396 6.5 12.5 3411 6.2 9.3 3420 8.0 12.3 3426 14.5 12.0 3440 8.2 . 10.0 Average 7.61 10.55 ICE LOLLIES BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION There is no prescribed standard for water ices or ice lollies sold as such, but as in former years ice lolly samples have been submitted to a test similar to the one applied to ice cream. Thirty-one lollies were examined and found to be satisfactory. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955 FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 These regulations which came into operation on the 1st October, 1960 amend and consolidate the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957. A number of amendments have been embodied in the general provisions of the Regulations in the light of the experience gained since they first came into operation. The most important of these amendments are described below (a) The term "catering business" has been introduced into regulations 25(2) (temperature at which certain foods are to be kept) and 28(1) (supply of water to stalls), in order to indicate more clearly the type of business to which these requirements apply. 37 (b) The definition of "meat" has been extended to include rabbits, game and poultry. (c) The scope of the expression "handling of food" is widened so that the obligation of food handlers will in future extend to persons who wash up or clean food equipment. (d) Herbal smoking mixture and snuff are now included with tobacco, which a person engaged in the handling of food shall refrain from using whilst he is handling open food or is in any food room in which there is open food. (e) Regulation 26 as amended makes it clear that food transport and delivery vehicles have to be kept clean and in good condition, and suitably and sufficiently lighted when being cleaned. A proviso has been added to permit the driving compartment of a stall or vehicle to be used as a sleeping place if it is effectively separated from the food compartment. The following is a summary of the number of food premises in the Borough:- Bakehouses 12 Butchers (including one horseflesh shop) 57 Confectioners (sugar and flour) 192 Fishmongers/Stalls/Fried Fish Shops 25 General Stores/Shops 16 Greengrocers/Stalls/Stores 94 Grocers 123 Ice Cream (Manufacture and sale of) 185 Licensed Public Houses 33 Milk Purveyors/DepSts/Dairies 35 Restaurants/Cafes/Snack Bars/Dining Rooms 59 School and Industrial Canteens,''Kitchens/ Service Rooms 48 Other Food Premises .19 TOTAL 898 During the year 1246 visits were made to food business premises. 46 notices were served in connection with the 116 infringements discovered as detailed in the following table:– Food Hygiene Regulations Number of Infringements found in 1963 Number of Infringements rectified in 1963 (including infringements discovered in 1962, but rectified in 1963) Regulation No. 5 3 2 " 6 8 10 " 8 4 5 " 9 2 3 " 14 21 15 " 15 9 10 " 16 13 12 " 17 4 4 " 18 4 5 " 19 2 2 " 20 – 1 " 23 34 46 " 24 3 2 " 25 – 1 " 26 3 1 " 28 1 – " 29/30 5 2 TOTAL 116 121 38 It is gratifying to record that the majority of the traders continue to show a willing co-operation to comply with the requirements of the Regulations. Mention must also be made that the standard of hygiene in the various food premises and the cleanliness of the persons engaged in the handling of food is much improved, but constant vigilance is necessary. Prosecutions Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 to 1960 No proceedings were taken during the year under these Regulations. Complaints Regarding Food Unfit for Human Consumption The following comments are made in connection with complaints received and investigated during the year which did not warrant legal proceedings being taken, but appropriate action was taken in each case as found to be necessary. It will be seen that in some instances the nature of the complaint was not confirmed by examination.

Inspector. Bakehouses There are twelve bakehouses in the Borough. With one exception, all are provided with mechanical power. The standard of cleanliness and sanitary conditions in the majority of cases were found to be satisfactory as revealed by the visits of inspection made during the year. Shops Act 514 visits were made to various premises under the Shops Act and revealed that the arrangements made fcr the health and comfort of the shop workers are in the majority of cases satisfactory. 41 Schools The sanitary conditions and the water supply to the Schools in the area were found to be generally satisfactory. Hairdressers' and Barbers' Premises There are seventy-seven establishments in the Borough. The premises generally were found to conform to the requirements of the Hairdressers and Barbers Byelaws, 1947. Merchandise Marks Act One hundred and twenty-six visits were made to food premises under this Act. The infringements discovered were principally in connection with the marking of imported apples, tomatoes and dead poultry. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 The intention of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling material in upholstered articles, and other articles which are stuffed or lined. The Act provides for the registration of certain premises by the Local Authority on payment of a registration fee and the licensing of certain other premises on payment of a statutory fee. No applications to store rag flock were received during the year. Pet Animals Act, 1951 This Act came into operation on 1st April, 1952, and provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted by the Local Authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and on payment of a fee not exceeding ten shillings. Seven licence renewal applications and one new application for a licence was received and granted during 1963. Licensed Places of Public Entertainment There are seventeen licensed places of public entertainment in the Borough. They are used mainly for cinematograph shows, concerts, dancing and social functions. The general standard of cleanliness was found to be well maintained. Licensed Public Houses 9 visits of inspection were made to the 33 licensed public houses in the Borough. 42 As a result of ins pections under the Food Hygiene Regulations a considerable number of improvements have been carried out at many public houses. These include the provision of additional or improved sanitary conveniences, washbasins, hot water supply, improved ventilation to kitchens, bars and cellars and the more general use of detergents and sterilising agents for the washing of utensils beer pipe lines and pumps. The Consumer Protection Act, 1961 Three visits were made to premises from which heating appliances are sold. This involved the carrying out of tests on the many types and designs of heaters offered for sale. No infringements of the Act were discovered. Noise Abatement Act, I960 Under Section 1 of this Act which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law becomes a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. Local Authorities will under this procedure be able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance by the service of an abatement notice on the person causing the nuisance or on the owner or occupier of premises on which it arises and if the notice is not complied w:*h it can be enforced by proceedings in a magistrates court Apart from action by a local authority, three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make a complaint to a magistrate. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. (except in special circumstances) and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment with the exception that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are for sale. The loudspeaker is, however, nof to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. Three complaints of noise were investigated and satisfactorily dealt with during the year. 43 Disinfection and Disinfestation Council Houses Private Houses Other Premises Number of premises treated with insecticide for bugs and fleas 1 6 Nil The insecticides used were Pybuthrin, D.D.T- Residual and Municipal Spray, Gammexane Liquid Spray, Zaldecide M. Powder and Fumex Fumigctors, RODENT CONTROL The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 A. Surface Treatments (1) 6375 visits were made during the year by the Rodent Operator and 748 by the Public Health Inspectors to premises infested or possibly harbouring rats or mice. 408 premises were cleared of rats or mice and no major infestations were recorded. (2) The work for the year is generally summarised as under:- Complaints received or cases discovered and investigated 478 Number of premises found to be infested 411 Number of premises where no evidence of rodents found 67 Number of premises cleared of rats or mice (including 28 previous year's cases) 408 Number of premises still being treated at the year end 31 (3) The cause or site of infestation at the 411 infested premises was:- Keeping of poultry 2 Inside premises (under floors etc.)-rats 19 Inside premises (under floors etc.)-mice 26 Buries, scrapes, etc., in gardens, land, etc. 239 Under or inside sheds 122 Defective drains 3 Total 411 (4) Type of premises found to be infested:- With Rats With Mice Total Council Property 8 1 9 Dwelling-houses 347 9 356 Business premises, etc. 11 12 23 Schools, Hospitals, Canteens etc. 4 4 8 Land 15 - 15 Total 385 26 411 (5) Summary of the type of premises and methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice:- Type of premises cleared- Dwelling-houses (mainly in gardens) 349 Food shops and food premises 14 Non-food shops Waste Land and building sites 15 Hospitals and Schools 7 Factories and Workplaces 6 Council Premises (other than dwellings) 11 Miscellaneous 5 Total 408 45 The methods employed in clearing premises of rats and mice were as follows Warfarin and other Poison Baits 401 Rat and Mouse Proofing - Drains repaired 1 Gassing 1 Total 408 B. Sewer Treatments (1) Treatment No, 32-Second Maintenance Treatment (1962-63) The second maintenance treatment of soil sewer-manholes in the areas found to be infested during the previous treatment was completed on the 30th March, 1963 Anticoagulant poison-Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was used with pinhead oatmeal, technical white oil, castor sugar, and para-nitrophenol (mould inhibitor) as a bait base. Rebaiting of all infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded. The following is a summary of the results obtained:- Number of Sections A B C D E Total Manholes baited-1st visit 18 32 34 126 24 234 Complete takes-2nd visit 1 7 - 3 2 13 Partial takes-2nd visit - 2 - 2 4 8 Complete takes-3rd visit - 1 - - - 1 Partial takes-3rd visit - 4 - 1 5 10 Takes-4th visit - - - - - Nil (2) Test Baiting (1963-64) With the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food no further test baiting will be carried out in the sewers of the Borough, due to the fact that the records of past treatments and tests shew where the main seats of rat infestation are most likely to occur and it will therefore be possible to carry out two treatments a year on those areas of infestation. In addition it will now be possible to systematically treat all manholes on the Council's soil sewers over a period of say 5 years and in this way any small isolated area of infestation will be dealt with. (3) Treatment No. 33 - First Maintenance Treatment (1963-64) This treatment was confined to the sections proved to be infested by the annual 10% test baiting, and operations were completed on the 19th October, 1963. Warfarin 0.5% Master Mix was again used, as this poison is harmless to the operators using it and a more positive result is anticipated by the complete eradication of rats in the sewers treated. 46 Rebaiting and examination of the infested manholes continued until no bait takes were recorded. The following is a tabulated summary of the results achieved:- Number of Sections A B C D Total Manholes baited-1st visit 27 131 39 45 242 Complete takes-2nd " - 5 12 1 18 Partial takes-2nd " 1 - 3 8 12 Takes-3rd " - - - - Nil (4) Key to Sections Section A- Sutton- All roads south of the Sutton Station and east of Brighton Road.

Section D- Cheam- All roads between London Road and Stonecot Hill and West of the Wimbledon, St. Helier Branch Line, Section E- Worcester Park- All roads west of Stonecot Hill and London Road. 47 INCIDENCE OF AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS DISEASES One thousand, one hundred and thirty five cases of notifiable diseases, other than tuberculosis, were notified during 1963, compared with five hundred cases in 1962, and one thousand, two hundred and sixty eight in 1961. Scarlet Fever. Thirty six cases were notified in 1963, as against thirty in 1962. There were six cases in the first guarter, fifteen in the second guarter, eight in the third guarter and seven in the fourth guarter. The illness was generally mild and there were no deaths. The less exacting control of Scarlet Fever continued, thus causing less interference with school attendance of cases and contacts, and is justified whilst the illness remains so mild. Diphtheria No case was notified during the year. The last case in Sutton and Cheam occurred in 1951. Diphtheria Antitoxin The possibility of Diphtheria must still always be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infections of the throat The early injection of antitoxin is the most effective treatment of Diphtheria. Swabs for diagnosis should be taken before any antibiotic is administered. Any suspected cases are best admitted to isolation hospital at once for diagnosis and treatment. Diphtheria Immunisation. Diphtheria Immunisation has again been shown to be very necessary by a number of small outbreaks of Diphtheria in the country, including the London area. Children should be immunised before the age of twelve months, and if Triple Antigen is used, which is very desirable, immunisation should be started as early as the second or third month, with reinforcing doses at fifteen tc eighteen months, school entry, and at age eight to ten years. Immunisation is free of charge for children under sixteen years of age, and can be arranged through the family doctor or at Child Welfare and School Clinics. During 1963, one thousand and forty four children received a primary course of immunisation as follows:- Children Born in Years 1963 1962 1961 1960 1959 19541958 19491953 Total Number Immunised: 478 483 24 6 6 45 2 1044 In addition, one thousand, one hundred and forty five children received reinforcing injections. Measles. Nine hundred and seventy six cases were notified in 1963, compared with four hundred and twenty two cases in 1962. There was no death. Six hundred and thirty two of the cases were notified during the first guarter of the year. 48 The monthly incidence of notified cases is shown in the following table:- January 205 July 29 February 202 August 7 March 225 September - April 167 October 8 May 74 November 20 June 29 December 10 Measles cases must be kept out of school for ten days after the appearance of the rash and may then return if the child is sufficiently well to do so. Contacts are not excluded except the under fives, who should then be excluded for fourteen days from the date of appearance of the rash in the last case in the home. However, all contacts should be carefully scrutinised daily before being allowed to go to school, and should be excluded if suffering from a cough, cold, chill or red eyes. No child who is known for certain to have had the disease need be excluded. The illness can be prevented or modified by the injection of gamma globulin early in the incubation period. A small quantity is available to doctors for cases of special risk. Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Whooping Cough. Thirty six cases were notified in 1963, compared with seventeen cases in 1962. There was no death. Whooping Cough is a serious infection in early infancy. The danger of mortality is highest in the first three months of life and diminishes with age. Every effort should be made to protect babies and weakly infants from contact with infection. The vaccines give substantial protection. Immunisation should commence not later than three months of age. Cases are excluded from school for twenty eight days from the beginning of the characteristic cough. Child contacts under seven years of age should be excluded for twenty one days from the date of onset of a case in their home if they have not had the disease. Health Visitors are informed of notified cases of children under five years of age so that they may give advice where necessary. Immunisation against Whooping Cough. Immunisation against Whooping Cough is available free of charge for children under five years of age, either through the family doctor or at Child Welfare Clinics. Three injections are given at monthly intervals. The injections are preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Tetanus, and should be commenced as early as the second or third month. In 1963, nine hundred and ninety three children received a primary course of immunisation. In addition, five hundred and sixty eight children were given reinforcing injections during the year. Smallpox. No case was notified. Vaccination against Smallpox. That the spech of travel has increased the risk of importing Smallpox has unfortunately ??? proved several times in recent years, the last occasion being early 1962. There is as yet no 49 drug accepted as a cure for the illness and our protection depends, as always, on vaccination. Vaccination is recommended in infancy, before the age of two years, preferably in the second year, and provides a basal immunity which should be reinforced between the age of eight and ten years. Vaccination is free of charge as regards infants and children of compulsory school age, and can be arranged through the family doctor or at the nearest Child Welfare Centre. The following table shows the numbers of vaccinations during 1963 Age Number Vaccinated Number Re-Vaccinated 0-3 Months 8 - 3-6 Months 8 - 6-9 Months 23 - 9-12 Months 24 - 1 Year 171 - 2-4 Years 17 7 5-14 Years 7 14 15 Years and Over 5 4 Totals 263 25 The number of children being vaccinated is too low. Puerperal Pyrexia Eight cases were notified in 1963, compared with eleven in 1962. No case occurred at home. Puerperal Pyrexia is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4 Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage". Tetanus. Tetanus Immunisation is free of charge, as for Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Immunisation, for children under sixteen. Immunisation can be given separately, but in infants is preferably combined with immunisation against Diphtheria and Whooping Cough. Reinforcing doses are required at fifteen to eighteen months, at school entry and at age eight to ten years. A further dose can then be given instead of anti-tetanus serum following accidents. At present it is routine to inject anti-tetanus serum after wounds to persons not known to be immunised and it is now common to give an injection of tetanus toxoid at the same time and follow up with two further doses at monthly intervals to give active immunity and avoid the need for further anti-tetanus serum (which can cause reaction) at some future date. A record of the dates of tetanus injections should always be carried on the person. During 1963, one thousand, one hundred and nineteen children received primary injections, and nine hundred and sixty eight children received reinforcing injections. It is very desirable that all who work in agriculture or in stables should be immunised against Tetanus as the tetanus bacillus is present in horse manure and manured land. Infection enters the body through contaminated wounds and abrasions. Food Poisoning No case was notified, compared with five cases in 1962. The absence of infections due to Salmonellae and Staphylococci in food is most satisfactory. Prevention of infection depends on scrupulous 50 cleanliness in the production, storage, manufacture and distribution of food. The washing of hands after use of the W.C. is the most effective protective measure against intestinal carriers of infection. Early notification of cases of food poisoning is necessary so as to obtain the residue of suspected food for bacteriological examination. No food handler should ever be allowed to return to work without bacteriological clearance. Dysentery. There were thirty eight cases of Dysentery in 1963, compared with one case in 1962. All were of the Sonne type. Ten cases occurred in an institution, ten in five families which had some connection with a school out of the Borough, and eighteen cqses occurred in ten unconnected incidents, Sonne Dysentery is a highly infectious form of gastro-enteritis. The infection is spread by faecal contamination of hands, objects, and in particular, lavatory seats. Prevention depends on the washing of hands after use of the W.C. and on the efficient cleansing of communal W.Cs. in schools and public places. It is most desirable that all cases of diarrhoea should be checked bacteriologically, particularly in the case of school children, and is essential in food handlers. Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fevers. No case of Typhoid Fever was reported. However, there were a few related cases of Paratyphoid Fever which affected four families and gave rise to seven cases and six carriers (symptomless excreters). The cases were associated with others in a neighbouring district and were related to cream cakes from a bakery in that other district which had a branch establishment in the Borough. The tracing back of purchases to this branch establishment led to quicker confirmation of the source. The organism responsible was Salmonella 'Taunton' and was almost certainly contained in a particular batch of imported eggs. Meningococcal Infection. There was one reported death from meningococcal infection in a child of two months. There was no bacteriological confirmation and the case was not notified. Poliomyelitis. The year 1963 was the fifth successive year the Borough has been free from Poliomyelitis. The reduction in the number of cases in England and Wales reported in 1962 continued, and the figures for 1963 were rather less than one fifth of those for 1962, and about one eighteenth of those for 1961. With the easy to take oral vaccine now freely available for the priority groups, there is no reason why their protection should not attain and maintain the one hundred per cent. mark. During the year approximately one thousand, one hundred and twenty one persons were vaccinated against Poliomyelitis in the following groups:- (1) Children bom in 1963 152 (2) Children born in 1962 702 (3) Children born in 1961 82 (4) Children and young persons barn 1943-1960 90 (5) Persons born 1932-1942 40 (6) Other priority groups 55 51 In addition, one hundred and sixty persons received third doses, and one thousand, two hundred and thirty three persons received fourth doses during the year. Acute Encephalitis. There were no cases in 1963. Pneumonia. There were ninety three deaths from Pneumonia in 1963, compared with fifty five in 1962. Thirty four cases of Pneumonia were notified in 1963, compared with twelve in 1962. Nine cases were of Influenzal Pneumonia. Non-Notifiable Diseases. School teachers reported two hundred and sixty four cases of Mumps, two hundred and fifteen cases of Chicken Pox and nineteen cases of German Measles. School returns are a useful index of the prevalence of non-notifiable diseases and are a basis for consultation with the School Medical Officer. Infestations. One suspected case of Scabies was treated during the year. International Certificates of Vaccination Nine hundred and thirty eight International Certificates of Vaccination were scrutinised and authenticated for eight hundred and eighty five persons during the course of the year 52 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER THAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING 1963 Disease AGE IN YEARS TOTALS Removed to Hospital Died * Under 1 1 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 35 45 Over 65 Scarlet Fever _ 2 1 2 3 27 - - - 1 - - 36 2 - Diphtheria - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Typhoid Fever - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Paratyphoid Fever - - - - - 4 2 - - 1 - - 7 5 - Puerperal Pyrexia - - - - - - - - 7 1 - - 8 - - Pneumonia - - - 1 - 2 - 2 4 - 9 16 34 3 93 Erysipelas - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Dysentery 1 4 5 2 2 10 1 2 11 - - - 38 9 . - Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Meningococcal Infection - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Acute Encephalitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Measles 28 104 148 147 142 367 24 11 - 4 - 1 976 3 - Whooping Cough 3 1 3 5 6 13 4 - 1 - - - 36 1 - Food Poisoning - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - *Under column "Died", all deaths, whether notified in the district or outside it, or not notified at all, are included. 53 DISTRIBUTION OF NOTIFIABLE DISEASES IN WARDS Disease WARDS TOTAL N.

There was no death from pulmonary tuberculosis in 1963, compared with one in 1962. There was one death from non-pulmonary tuberculosis, as against none in 1962. The total death rate from tuberculosis was 0 013 per thousand of population, the same as in 1962. For England and Wales the death rate was 0.063 per thousand of population (0.056 per thousand for pulmonary tuberculosis and 0 007 per thousand for non-pulmonary tuberculosis). The number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis was fourteen, as in 1962. Residual foci of infection still persist, particularly among the middle aged and elderly, and intensive search will be necessary to eliminate the disease. The use of B.C.G. vaccine in adolescent children gives a high measure of protection. Four hundred and seventy nine children received injections in 1963, and nine children were found to be Mantoux positive. The response rate in the thirteen year age group was 69.8 per cent. Four new cases of non-pulmonary tuberculosis were notified in 1963, compared with five in 1962. The Sutton and Cheam Tuberculosis and Chest Care Committee continued their valuable work in providing assistance to both tuberculosis and other chest patients and their families throughout the year. Additional nourishment, clothing, bedding and fuel were provided where necessary, and no needy case goes without help. Grants were made to provide occupational therapy, and holidays were arranged for children, mothers, and convalescent patients. The Chairman is Mrs. F Smyth, J.P., and the Hon.Secretary is County Alderman Mrs. Margaret Walkden, O.B.E., J.P., 9 All Saints Road, Sutton.

A further visit was made from the 5th to 15th November, 1963, when a Unit was stationed by the Public Hall, Sutton, examining two thousand, four hundred and forty members of the general public and one thousand and eighty members of industrial groups In addition a Unit visited a local hospital and examined one hundred members of the staff. This gave a total of four thousand, five hundred and ninety persons examined (one thousand, eight hundred and seventy males and two thousand, seven hundred and twenty females) and out of these, one man was found to require treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis and three men and one woman were found to have primary lung cancer This showed an incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis of 0 22 per thousand persons examined, and of lung cancer of 0.87 per thousand persons examined 56 APPENDIX ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH IN RESPECT OF THE YEAR 1963 FOR THE BOROUGH OF SUTTON AND CHEAM IN THE COUNTY OF SURREY PRESCRIBED PARTICULARS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FACTORIES ACT, 1961 PART 1 OF THE ACT 1.
