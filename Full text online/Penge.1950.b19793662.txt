To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to present an Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1950, which has been compiled in accordance with Circular No. 112/50 of the Ministry of Health. The Vital Statistics for the year continue to compare favourably with other parts of the country. Again it is noticeable that a high proportion of the deaths occurring in the district were those of persons of 65 years of age and over. This large number of elderly people has again presented many problems in providing for their care and welfare, and it is gratifying to record the large amount of help given to them by various voluntary organisations, especially in the provision of meals in their own homes. Difficulty has been found in providing institutional treatment for those who were unable to care for themselves at home. Again, the value of diphtheria immunisation has been proved by the fact that for the third year in succession no case of diphtheria was notified in Penge. In spite of the prevalence of Poliomyelitis in England during the year, it is gratifying to record that only four cases occurred in Penge. During the early part of the year the Council adopted the Ministry of Food model byelaws for clean food. This department invited the co-operation of all traders in foodstuffs in applying the byelaws with satisfactory results, and it is with some pleasure that I can report that only two cases of food poisoning were notified, details of which are recorded elsewhere in this report. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 770 Population (Census, 1931) 27,771 Home Population, Mid-year 1950 (estimated by Registrar-General) 25,160 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1950 £199,028 Sum represented by 1d. rate £811 4 The district is situated on the slope of a hill, its highest point being 370 ft. above sea level and the lowest 95 ft. above sea level. The density of population per acre is 32.6, this being the highest in the County of Kent. The remains of the Crystal Palace and the greater part of the grounds occupying approximately 127 acres, are within the district and provide a much needed "lung." The district is mainly residential although in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of industrial work in the district, the chief industries being engineering, button making, printing and laundry work. VITAL STATISTICS. Crude Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 22.05 Adjusted Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 21.60 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 0.59 Still birth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 26.31 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 11.36 Adjusted Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Home population 10.45 Deaths from Puerperal Causes:—Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births Nil Death Rate of Infants Under One Year of Age. All infants per 1,000 live births 25.22 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 20.91 illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 103.44 Births. The live births registered during the year numbered 555. This gives a crude live birth rate of 22.05 per 1,000 Home population, compared with 20.84 for 1949. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local birth rates is 0.98. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 21.60. Stillbirths. The number of stillbirths registered was 15, equal to a rate of 26.31 per 1,000 total births, compared with 22.64 for 1949. Deaths. The deaths registered totalled 286, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.36 per 1,000 Home population, compared with 11.22 for 1949. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.92. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 10.45, compared with 10.32 for 1949. 5 Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 11. It should be noted that a large proportion of the deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths 206 or 72.0% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 68.8% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 45.8% of the total deaths, compared with 42.6% in 1949. Cancer. The cancer death rate per 1,000 home population was 1.66, compared with 2.01 in 1949. Tuberculosis. The death rate per 1,000 home population was 0.43 as against 0.40 in 1949. Maternal Mortality. There was no maternal death during the year. The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales was 0.86 per 1,000 total (live and still) births. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year of age was 14, corresponding to a rate of 25.22 per 1,000 births compared with a rate of 19.30 for 1949, which is the lowest recorded in Penge. Nine of the 14 infants died under the age of one week. Comparative Vital Statistics. The following table shows the comparative figures for 1950:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 21.6 0.59 10.4 25.2 England and Wales 15.8 0.37 11.6 29.8 126 County Boroughs and Great Towns including London • 17.6 0.45 12.3 33.8 148 Smaller Towns (resident populations, 25,000 to 50,000 at Census, 1931) .. 16.7 0.38 11.6 29.4 London Administrative County 17.8 0.36 11.8 26.3 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. All the houses in the district are provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water being examined bacteriologically daily by the Board. In addition, the County Pathologist reports that the samples of water submitted to him quarterly were good. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Seven storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage. All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams. There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation. The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing. During the first three months of the year house refuse was collected throughout the district by a contractor once every week and removed by him in closed vehicles. In April, 1950, the Council fully took over the refuse collection service, modern vehciles being used and the refuse taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. There are no cesspools within the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. This subject is deall with in the Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. 7 HOUSING. During the year private builders erected 15 dwellinghouses, one block of 7 flats and converted 10 houses into 23 flats. The erection of 132 flats in Queen Adelaide Road was completed by the Council's Contractors during the year. Work in connection with the erection of 86 flats in Croydon Road by the Council's Contractors was continued during the year. 1.

A man, aged 77 years, suffering from gangrene of both feet, had no one to look after him except his nephew who was at work all day. His basement room was dirty and the stench a nuisance to the people living in the flats above. Application had been made by his own doctor three months previously for his admission to hospital without success. His admission was urged by this department to the Group Hospital office also without success, and application was made for a Court Order for his admission. Before the case could be heard the man died. Other cases not so pressing as this one occurred during the year but in none of them was a Court Order asked for, although in most cases death occurred before they were admitted to an institution. FOOD. The Council adopted byelaws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, for securing the observance of Sanitary and Cleanly Conditions and Practices in connection with the Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food and Sale of Food in the open air. These byelaws came into operation on the 17th July, 1950, and copies were delivered to the occupiers of food premises, food factories, works canteens and food stalls, by the Sanitary Inspectors, who discussed the provisions thereof with the occupiers. Deputations of local bakers and butchers were received when the requirements of the byelaws were explained and the co-operation of the deputations invited in securing compliance therewith. A special leaflet was given to the occupiers of food premises giving information as to the causes of food poisoning and advice regarding personal hygiene, the steps to take to avoid contamination of food and recommending the storage of cooked food in low temperatures. Whilst the byelaws are a valuable addition to legislation dealing with food, the education of the food handlers is very important in the provision of a safe food supply. Your Inspectors, during their visits to food premises, make use of the opportunities presented to give instruction in hygienic food preparation and handling, and stress in particular the importance of personal hygiene, the absence of which is one of the chief causes of food poisoning outbreaks. 12 During the summer months there was increased activity by food traders to protect foodstuffs from fly contamination, and the destruction of flies by up-to-date scientific methods. The films "Another Case of Food Poisoning" and "Fly about the Flouse" were shown at local cinemas during the autumn. During the year two cases of food poisoning were notified. One of the cases, in which the organism responsible was not found, was undoubtedly infected in another district, and in the other, infected by an organism of the Salmonella group, the source of infection could not be found. Both made a satisfactory recovery. Arrangements were made during the year for the bacteriological examination of milk, ice-cream and other foods to be undertaken by the Public Health Laboratory Service, Park Hospital, S.E.13. free of charge. No animals were slaughtered in the district. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation. I am, Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B. E. HAWKINS, Medical Officer of Health. 13 Notifiable Diseases (other than Tuberculosis) during the Year 1950.

Town Hall, Anerley Road, S.E.20. June, 1951. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1950. There is no doubt that Rent Control and the greatly increased cost of repairs have contributed to the deterioration of house property in the district. Many landlords, owing to their low financial circumstances, are neglecting their property, and in consequence complaints are made by tenants to the sanitary inspectors for action to be taken to improve their housing conditions. This is reflected in the large number of complaints (1,224) received regarding nuisances and defects in premises. In districts which received wide-spread war damage such as Penge, delay is occasioned in executing repairs to property owing to the prolonged negotiations between owners and the War Damage Commission regarding war damage claims, and until agreement is reached owners are very reluctant to have repairs carried out, since to do so might prejudice their claims. As will be seen on reference to the list of work executed a large amount of repair work has, however, been done in consequence of action by your inspectors. In this connection statutory action is taken only when every informal effort has failed. It was found necessary to institute legal proceedings against several owners in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects and the following is a summary of these cases heard during the year:— Case No. Result. 1. Nuisance Order made to do work in 21 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. Council did work in default. 2. Nuisance Order made to do work in 42 days and pay £1 10s. 6d costs. (a) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £5 0s. Od. (b) Continued non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Case adjourned for four months to enable work to be done. 3. Nuisance Order made to do work in 21 days and pay £1 10s. 6d. costs. 4. Summons withdrawn on payment of 3s. 6d. costs, the work having been done before hearing of case. 5. Nuisance Order made to do work in 56 days and pay £1 10s. 6d. costs. (a) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £5 0s. Od. (b) Continued non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Case adjourned for four months to enable work to be done. 17 Case No. Result. 6. Nuisance Order made to do work in 21 days and pay £1 11s. 6d. costs. 7.

Nuisance Order made to do work within 14 days and pay £1 1s. Od. costs and Court costs. Council did work in default. 11. 12 and 13. Cases adjourned to enable owners to negotiate for extension of lease. (a) Further adjournment. 14. Nuisance Order made to do work within 14 days and pay £1 10s. 6d. costs. (a) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £5 0s. Od. 15. Nuisance Order made to do work within 28 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 16. Work completed before final hearing of case. Defendant ordered to pay 5s. Od. costs. 17. Nuisance Order made to do work within 14 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 843 written informal notices and 121 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936, and one statutory notice under Section 9, Housing Act, 1936. Seven hundred and twenty-two intimation notices and 113 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority in default of the owners, had carried out the works required by one statutory notice served under Section 45, three under Section 75 and three under Section 94 of the Public Health Act, 1936, and one notice served under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936. The Council also did the work required by 31 notices served under Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains) at 38 premises. Demolition Orders were made under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936, regarding two houses, one of which was demolished during the year. A Closing Order was made under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, respecting a basement flat of two underground rooms which could not be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 89 premises were wholly or partially relaid and 102 cleared of obstructions. In many instances drains were found to be obstructed by sanitary towels.

The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale has been regularly carried out. Communications were sent to the occupiers of 34 food premises regarding defects found, and in each case the work was carried out without statutory action being necessary. Proceedings were taken under Sections 9 and 10, Food & Drugs Act, 1938, against a confectionery firm for selling a meringue containing mice excreta. The Justices imposed a fine of £5 0s. 0d. and ordered the defendants to pay £5 5s. 0d. costs. Your sanitary inspectors gave advice to occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food hygiene and found that they were willing to co-operate. In two cases written warnings were given following reports to the Public Health Committee regarding contraventions of the byelaws. The amount of food surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption after examination by your inspectors was 24 tons, 14 cwts., 0 qtrs., 16 lbs., an increase of nearly 14 tons over that condemned in 1949. The foods condemned were as follows :— Bacon 45,097 lbs. Puddine mixture 56 lbs. Beef 2,735 „ Rusks 19 cwts. Biscuits 13 „ Sauces 2 bots.

Condemnation certificates totalled 377, compared with 473 in 1949. Milk Supply:— There are no cowsheds in the district. All milk sold in the district is special designated milk in sealed containers. 21 Milk (Special Designations) Orders. The following licences were issued Dealers' Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 5 Pasteurised milk 7 Sterilised milk . 9 Supplementary Licences : Tuberculin tested milk 4 Pasteurised milk 5 Sterilised milk 4 Milk Sampling. informal samples of milk submitted to chemical analysis totalled 42, and all were found to be genuine. The analyses of the 42 samples show the following averages:— Fat—3.64% (standard 3.0%). Solids not fat—8.85% (standard 8.5%). Twenty-nine samples of pasteurised milk and six samples of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk were submitted to the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase Tests and they all satisfied the tests. Seven samples of sterilised milk satisfied the turbidity test. Ice Cream. There are no manufacturers in the district, but a number of premises arc registered for the sale of ice-cream, the shopkeepers obtaining their supplies from well-known manufacturers. Thirty-one samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the Methylene Blue Test with the following results :— Grade 1-—19 ; Grade 2—7 ; Grade 3—4 ; Grade 4—1. The dealer whose sample was in Grade 4 was given advice regarding precautions to be observed in the cleansing of equipment and subsequent samples were of Grade 1. In no case were samples found to be consistently below Grade 2 and in all cases temperatures did not exceed 28° F. Twenty-nine samples were submitted to analysis for fat content and all were found to contain more than 2½% fat, the results ranging from 4.0% to 12.0%. Slaughterhouses. No animals were slaughtered in the district. Bakehouses. The occupiers' appeal to the Court of Summary Jurisdiction against the Council's decision to withdraw the Certificate of Suitability of the last underground bakehouse in the district was withdrawn, the bakehouse having been removed to another part of the premises. Defects found in two bakehouses were remedied after informal action. 22 Adulteration. The Kent County Sampling Officers took 108 samples of various foods and drugs in this district. Included in the total were 29 samples of milk, 20 drugs and 10 of spirits. One sample of salad cream and one of tincture of quinine were reported to be of inferior quality, but further samples in these cases proved to be satisfactory. Your Inspectors obtained 42 informal samples of milk, the Analyst reporting all samples to be genuine. Factories Act, 1937. Visits paid to factories totalled 155 and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, 20 written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with minor defects. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919 and Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Complaints numbering 318 were received from all parts of the district and investigated. In no case was a major infestation discovered and there is no doubt that the employment of a rodent operative during recent years has resulted in a decrease in the number of rodents in the district. Rats are such prolific breeders, however, that constant action against them is necessary. In several cases defective drains and sewers were the cause of rat infestation and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of infestations. When considered necessary the drains of premises were tested with smoke and colour and all defects found made good. The foul-water sewers were treated during June and December, pre-bait and poisoned bait being laid in the manholes and side entrances. In June 314 manholes were bailed and pre-bait takes recorded in 108. The figures for December were 316 manholes baited and pre-bait takes recorded in 141. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of the work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 2,785 Premises reported infested with rats 338 Premises treated for rats .. .. .381 Premises where rat poision bait taken 352 Premises re-treated for rats .. 326 Estimated number of rats poisoned 1,658 Number of rats trapped 16 Premises treated for mice 158 Premises re-treated for mice 86 It was necessary to treat some premises on three or more occasions and the total treatments for the destruction of rodents numbered 951. 23 Shops Act, 1950. Mr. E. G. Thomas, Deputy Chief Sanitary Inspector and Shops Act Inspector, reports as follows :— Number of visits made 241 Number of evening patrols carried out 60 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 23 Number of shops where sanitary and washing accommodation insufficient.

Legal Proceedings—Sunday trading :— One shopkeeper, who had been previously warned for selling goods contrary to the provisions of the Shops (Sunday Trading Restrictions) Act, 1936, was proceeded against. The Justices imposed a fine of twenty shillings. I should like to express my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and assistance and to the Staff for their great help and efficient service during another busy year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. T. PEARCE, Chief Sanitary Inspector.
