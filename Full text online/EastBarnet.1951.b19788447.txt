Cast iBarnft 33rban district Council. SEVENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1951. To the Chairman and Members of the East Barnet Urban District Council Mrs. Jackson and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my Report for the year 1951. Milk Supply The report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector again shows that all samples taken during the year were found to be satisfactory. This is the second year in succession that we have had no bad samples and reflects credit on all concerned in the handling of this food. The need for constant vigilance and supervision remains. Water Supply The water which is obtained from deep wells sunk into the chalk is supplied by the Barnet District Water Company. The Company have an up-to-date chemical and bacteriological laboratory in charge of which is a qualified chemist. During the year 1,787 examinations were made, 98-8 per cent, being B. coli free in 100 ml. 1 Samples are also sent periodically to independent analysts in London for their examination and the following report is characteristic of such examinations:— "This is a clear and bright water free from odour and taste and neutral in reaction. It is hard in character, free from metals and contains no excess of saline matter. "Both organically and bacteriologically the water is of a high degree of purity and is a pure and wholesome water suitable for public supply purposes." Twelve samples were also taken by us and submitted for examination. The reports were in every case satisfactory. Diphtheria Prophylaxis For the fourth year in succession we have been fortunate in that no cases of Diphtheria have been notified, but the statement should not in the slightest degree be taken as lessening the need for continuing the policy of advertising the real protection given by immunisation. There is a distinct fear that the very absence of this disease may itself breed a slackening of the immunisation rate with disastrous results. I would like to pay a tribute to the unceasing propaganda of the Health Visitors, which has gone far in producing the present position. Scabies No cases of Scabies were notified, and as I commented last year, Scabies has now become once again an uncommon disease in this district. Infectious Diseases During 1951 there was one case of Poliomyelitis notified, unfortunately fatal. This death occurred in hospital. Measles and Whooping Cough were again prevalent, Measles particularly so, but fortunately of a reasonably mild variety with few complications. The other statistics remain remarkably consistent. Old Age Attention continues to be paid to the problems of the older folk, and this department now has a representative on the local committee which has in the past few years done so much to alleviate some of the problems of old age. 2 Food Byelaws The large increase in the number of visits paid to food shops will be noted, resulting in a considerable increase in the standards of cleanliness observed. Housing This problem increases each year, and there are a number of sub-standard properties which, were the re-housing position a little less difficult, should be condemned. But the present situation renders it almost impossible to carry demolition orders into effect, owing to the difficulties of rehousing the tenants. The Chief Sanitary Inspector As this is the last complete year in which Mr. Houghton will serve the district as Chief Sanitary Inspector, this appears the appropriate time to place on record his invaluable services to Public Health in this area. A life time—52 years—in local government service, of which 25 years have been spent as Chief Sanitary Inspector in this district, is a fact meriting a high place in local government records. I can speak from personal knowledge of Mr. Houghton during his whole time in East Barnet, and it has been a pleasure to work closely with him during the past ten years. His profound knowledge of his multifarious duties has enabled him to deal tactfully and expeditiously with the daily problems confronting a Sanitary Inspector, and the district will remember his lengthy service with gratitude. 1 have on many occasions referred to my personal debt to him for his unfailing help in all public health matters, and am glad to be assured his local knowledge will always be readily available despite his retirement from local government service. My most sincere thanks to all members of my staff for their usual untiring patience and perseverance throughout the year. Your obedient Servant, C. M. SCOTT, m.r.c.s.(eng.), l.r.c.p.(lond.), Medical Officer of Health to the Council. 3 Area and Rateable Value The area of the district is 2,644 acres.

The two families had been rehoused on the Council's housing estates. The building No. 7, Somerset Road, the basement flat of which was closed in accordance with the Closing Order made in 1950, was sold, and the new owner undertook to repair and recondition the basement rooms. On completion of the work an application was received for the Closing Order to be cancelled. All the defects 10 having been remedied and the work being satisfactory, the Council made an Order under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, determining the Closing Order. The dwelling houses Nos. 2, 4 and 6, Hadley Highstone were . found on inspection to be unfit for human habitation and incapable of being made fit at a reasonable expense. A full report on the condition of these three houses was submitted, and, the owner being in agreement, the tenants were rehoused in Council property, and Nos. 4 and 6 were demolished. The owner then commenced the work of reconstruction and reconditioning of No. 2. The cottage No. 7, Dury Road, Hadley, known as "Thornden Friars Cottage" and the dwelling house No. 7, Edward Grove, were also reported as unfit for habitation and incapable of repair at reasonable expense. Estimates of the cost of repairs and reconditioning exceeded the estimated value of the property. The Committee authorised the service of the usual notices of the time and place when the matter would be considered with a view to the making of Demolition Orders. Rodent Control Two hundred and eighty-nine complaints of rat and mice infestations were received (309 in 1950). All were dealt with by the Rodent Operative. 270 dead rats and 50 dead mice were picked up after poisoning and trapping. The annual test of 10 per cent, of the sewer manholes, to ascertain the extent of rat infestation of the sewers, was again undertaken in accordance with the requirements of the Rodent Control Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture. Test baits of damp sausage rusk were laid in 156 manholes, and when inspected two days later there were 14 manholes where the bait had completely disappeared, and in 2 manholes part only of the bait had been consumed. A treatment of the sewers with sausage rusk and zinc phosphide was then undertaken after pre-baiting the manholes in the vicinity of those where the test baits had been taken. 31 manholes were poison baited with the result that there were 26 manholes where the poison baits had been partly taken. There were no complete "takes" of poison bait. Six months previously the half-yearly treatment had been carried out, 14 manholes being poison baited after pre-baiting 47 manholes. 13 manholes showed part "takes," in the remaining manhole the bait was untouched. These results indicated that the sewers were not seriously infested. National Assistance Act, 1948. Section 50, Burial or Cremation of the Dead There were two funerals under this Act. One, the body of a stillborn male child found on the Hadley Manor Estate, was buried at a 11 cost of 16s. 6d. The other was that of a newly-born female child which had been found under a hedge in Potters Lane. An inquest was held at which it was decided that death was due to inattention at birth and that the person responsible was unable to be traced. The cost of this funeral was £4 9s. Both were buried at the Hendon Park Cemetery. Verminous Houses Six privately owned houses were found to be infested with insects. All were disinfected by stripping and burning wallpaper and spraying with "Cooper's D.D.T." liquid insecticide.

As in the previous year there were no unsatisfactory samples. In 1949, 9 per cent, of samples taken were unsatisfactory; in 1948, 3 per cent.; in 1947, 9 per cent.; in 1946, 6 per cent.; in 1945, 10 per cent.; in 1944, 7 per cent.; in 1943, 9 per cent.; in 1942, 18 per cent.; and in 1941, 33 per cent. Ice Cream Three applications were received for the registration of premises for the sale of ice cream. The premises being satisfactory, all three applications were granted. Ninety-six samples were obtained and submitted for bacteriological examination, with the following results:— Provisional grade 1 81 ,, ,, 2 10 „ ,,3 0 ,, „ 4 5 96 The five grade 4 samples were taken in the months of June and July. Four of the five grade 4 samples were first samples, second samples taken a few days later resulted in one placed in grade 1, two in grade 2 and one again in grade 4; the third sample of this manufacturer was in grade 2. I communicated with the manufacturers in London, pointing out that two consecutive samples were reported as being placed in grade 4, and asked if they would investigate and let me have their observations. The Company replied, stating that they were concerned to learn that the samples had been graded other than in provisional grade 1. 13 They were most anxious to investigate this matter further, since the purity of their product had always been their first consideration, .and in order to assist their laboratory staff in conducting their investigations, they would be much obliged if we would favour them with further information on an attached form and return it to them. The form was promptly filled in and all particulars required were supplied and the form returned to the Company. The information required related chiefly to the method of taking and conveying the samples to the laboratory and also the temperature that the preincubation of the methylene blue tubes was carried out in the laboratory. Nothing further was heard from the Company, but the third sample taken the following week gave a grade 2 result. These samples were not sold by the retailer from bulk, but were all packed ready for sale to the customer, at the factory. Three other samples of this firm's manufacture taken later from other retailers all gave a grade I result. There was only one retailer who manufactured ice cream and only on a very small scale and by the cold mix method. All the other retailers purchase their supplies from large manufacturers whose factories are situated in other districts. Meat Inspection The requirements of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, have been duly observed as regards the butchers' shops in the district. Inspection of Other Foods All restaurants, snack bars, fried fish shops, canteens and other places where food is prepared have been visited and their kitchens and cooking utensils inspected for cleanliness. The following is a list of improvements effected in food shops as a result of visits of inspection under the byelaws controlling the handling, wrapping and delivery of food:— No. or Shops. Notices to wash hands fixed on or near sanitary conveniences 97 Provision of a satisfactory hot-water supply 33 Dirty walls and ceilings cleansed 25 Clean towels provided 12 Lining of walls to prevent contamination of foodstuffs 3 Defective W.C. fittings repaired or renewed 9 Wash basins provided 2 Shop heaters provided 3 Other minor improvements 8 14 Thirty aluminium plaques of notice to wash hands were supplied to shop proprietors at a charge of 2s. each.
