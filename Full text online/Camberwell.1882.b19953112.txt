The general and incidental repairing to the flagged footways of the parish, have been carried out by the masons and labourers in the employ of the Vestry. The material used in this work is obtained under the Masons General Contract. The contractors for the present year being Messrs. Wheeler and Hindle. 12 The material used for the foregoing works, both special and general, has been as follows:— York Paving 14,370 ft. super. Kerb 1,996 ft. lineal. TAR PAVED FOOTPATHS. The general repairs to tar paved footpaths are carried out by men employed by the Vestry. These repairs also include the trenches opened by the various companies, the cost of which is charged to them. The works during the past year have been as follows:— General Repairs (including Trenches) 16½ miles. Special works, new 2,264 yds. sup. Executed under contract 3,675 yds sup. ROAD WATERING. The watering of the public roads of the parish has been done by the staff and plant of the Vestry, 13 as in previous years. The supply of water being obtained partly from the various water companies and partly from the wells sunk in various roads in the lower districts. The following is an account of the cost of the supply:— Source of Water Supply for Road Watering. Length of Road watered. Price per Mile. Cost. Miles. £ s. d. £ s. d.

This work has been carried out as heretofore by the Vestry plant, &c., which has averaged as follows:— Horses 68 Water Vans 55 Water Carts 9 Material Carts 32 Slop Carts 40 Slop Vans 3 Horse Road Brooms 4 Horse Road Roller 1 The cost of the fodder, &c. for the horses in this department has amounted to £3,310 14s. 1d., being at the rate of 18s. 8½d. per horse per week. The following is an analysis of the fodder consumed per week per horse. Clover Mixture and Hay 3½ trusses. Straw (including bedding) 1½ „ Oats bushels. Beans 1/8 „ Bran 7½ lbs. The expenditure for the past year amounted to £13,355 10s. 9d.- in this cost is included, in 15 addition to the wages of drivers, horse-keepers, &c., the cost of water for roads; purchase of new plant and repairs; also all wheelwright's and painter's work; repairs to pumps and hydrants—and further includes the cost of material cartage, and road rolling, which has to be deducted to arrive at the actual cost of the work of slopping and watering. The account therefore is as follows: Total expenditure by this department 13,355 10 9 Less cost of material, cartage, road rolling, &c. 2,836 6 0 Net cost of "Watering and Slopping" only = per mile 136 £10,519 4 9 The quantity of slop collected and removed has been— Loads. Road slop 28,226 Gulley slop 1,955 Total 30,181 The like in 1881-2 26,206 16 DISPOSAL OF SLOP & ROAD REFUSE. Your Committee's last report stated that this matter was under the consideration of a Committee specially appointed for the purpose. It was found necessary that a speedy decision should be arrived at and acted upon, inasmuch as all the available slop shoots in the Parish were being fast closed up. The last one available, viz., Goose Green, was ordered by the Metropolitan Board of Works to be suspended, at a moment when the greatest quantity of slop was being removed. Under the advice of your Surveyor, it was determined to appropriate a portion of the newly acquired Glengall Wharf for this work. Two receiving tanks were constructed of concrete, having a capacity of about 2,000 cubic yards; into these receivers was deposited the liquid slop as collected, frequently amounting to nearly 200 loads per day. A system of filtration was provided in each of these tanks, by which the effluent water was run off into drainage pits, and thence through drains leading into the sewer which passes under the adjoining Canal. The filtration of the liquid slop considerably reduces the quantity to be removed from the tanks 17 into barges. These barges were provided under a temporary arrangement made with Mr. E. Burton, of Nine Elms, by whom the material, thus treated, was conveyed away and disposed of. This arrangement was fortunately made in sufficient time to cope with the large quantity of slop daily collected in an extremely wet season. By this combination of the working of the tank reservoirs and the barge removal, the arrangement sufficed for the purpose. The wharf accommodation reserved for this purpose is immediately fronting the tanks, having a lay-by for two barges-alongside at the same time. The method adopted was as follows'The semi-solid and solid slop was delivered direct into the barges, the liquid slop being shot into the tanks, which after filtering for a few days, was sufficiently solid to be wheeled from the tanks into the barges. During the nine weeks of working days—from January 17th to March 24th—2,171 loads were deposited in a liquid state into the tanks, and 606 loads from the carts into the barges direct; the total number of barge loads conveyed away being 48. c 18 These experimental arrangements proved satisfactory, and a comparison with similar work done in other parishes will show that it was economically performed. In order to prepare for the coming winter, the General Purposes Committee caused advertisements to be issued to barge owners, &c.; for a contract for the removal of the slop material from Midsummer, 1883, to Midsummer, 1884. Tenders were received, and that from Mr. W. Nichols, of New Charlton, Kent, was accepted by the Vestry, somewhat differing in method from that of Mr. E. Burton, previously referred to. This tender is to the effect that (so far as practicable) all slop, whether liquid or solid, shall be delivered into the barges direct. The price for liquid slop being per freight of 60 loads—that for solid slop, and the wheeling of solid slop from the tanks, 35s. per freight. It is calculated that the cost will be about on a par with the arrangement with Mr. E. Burton. The tanks will always be in reserve to meet emergencies in extraordinary wet weather, or when the supply of barges might fail from any cause; these precautions are absolutely necessary, 19 as during wet weather the removal of slop from the public streets cannot admit of delay. GLENGALL WHARF. The enormous growth of the Parish work, especially in the Slopping and Dusting Departments, and the exhaustion of nearly every means of local deposit, caused your Committee to take measures for increasing the wharfage space at their disposal. After joint consultation with the Sewers and Sanitary Committee, it was decided to recommend the Vestry to accept an offer to lease a vacant wharf on the west side of Glengall Road, on the banks of the canal, the property of Mr. Hart, upon the following terms:— The Leasehold portion is held from the Surrey Commercial Dock Company, for 20 years, at £90 per annum, and for the beneficial interest therein, the Vestry paid the sum of ^850. The Freehold portion the Vestry decided not then to purchase, but to rent the same for a term of 60 years, at £50 per annum. Upon these terms the Vestry have obtained a most eligible central position, for the collective works of Slopping, Dusting, &c., within easy distance of all the principal roads c 2 20 of the parish. Various necessary works have been carried out, such as raising the wharf wall, constructing staging, &c., to adapt this wharf for the removal of the Slop and Dust which are comprised in the arrangements for these two departments. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The advisability of purchasing a steam roller for the repair of the roads has been frequently brought to the notice of the General Purposes Committee, and as a tentative movement, permission was accorded by the Vestry to the Surveyor to hire a steam roller when he considered it could be economically used. Up to this time he has not taken advantage of this permission, for the reasons that, during the summer months, but little general repairs are carried on, and the whole of the horses are, as a rule, engaged in watering; and on the wet days of summer there is a surplusage of horses, which are consequently available for use in any required rolling, with the present five ton horse roller. In the winter season, when the whole of the 21 stud is available for carting materials on to, and removing slop from the roads, there is then also a sufficient number of horses available for road rolling purposes, and which horses otherwise in either of the contingent circumstances above referred to, were the horse labour not so disposed of, would unprofitably remain in the stables. It may be further remarked that the principal main roads of the parish have within the last few years been pitch paved, which materially lessens the amount of road rolling. Notwithstanding all the foregoing particulars —which are given to explain the economy of not having as yet incurred the cost of a steam roller— it is not to be in any way inferred that either the Committee or the Surveyor are averse to its introduction, should the opinion of the Vestry be in favor of such an outlay. PARLIAMENTARY DEPOSITATIONS. Session 1883. The report of the Surveyor upon these various matters is appended. 22 1882. REPORT on Tramways and Railways for Session 1883. SOUTHWARK AND DEPTFORD TRAMWAYS. W. Shelford, Engineer. Sutton d Ommanney, Solicitors, 3 & 4, Great Winchester Street, E.C. Route from St. James' Road to Old Kent Road and from thence along Peckham Park Road to High St., Peckham. This a proposed line of Tramway leading from Bermondsey Parish, joining the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, at the boundary, in St. James' Road, passing along the same by a single line to the Junction of the Rotherhithe New Road, with a loop at this point, from here, the line authorized and laid last year, continues to near the Old Kent Road, It is now proposed to extend this to the Old Kent Road, by a double line, then along the present line of double Tramway, which crosses the Canal Bridge in the Old Kent Road, to opposite the Peckham Park Road. The line of Tramway then commences anew by a single line along the Peckham Park Road, crossing 23 the Commercial Road, passing Bell Garden Road to Hill Street, and along Hill Street to High Street, Peckham, where, it is proposed to join the present lines of Tramway by a curved double Junction. It is also proposed, to have a short Junction Terminus at the rear of the Urinal at this place where the thoroughfare is already very narrow, and which proposal, for this reason, I think highly objectionable. Terminus at rear of Urinal, High Street, Peckham. From, the above double Junction, the course of the present Tramway lines will be used in High Street, Peckham, as far as Rye Lane, and, at this point it is proposed to join by a loop, the authorized line of last year to pass up Rye Lane, which was granted subject to the further consent of the Vestry. User of present Tram, ways in High Street, Peckham to, and junction with Rye Lane proposed Tramway. These proposed Tramways will be single lines, with loops in various places, except where the present lines of Tramways will be utilized. They will open up a Cross Tramway route from Bermondsey and Rotherhithe to the Old Kent Road—following southward to a General course 24 of these Tramways from north to south. junction with the London Tramways in Peckham High Street, and, should the East Dulwich lines (passed last Session) be constructed, this new line will form a continuous route southward—towards the Crystal Palace, and which, no doubt, will as a whole, tend to the general advantage of the locality. Narrow width of Roadway. On reference to the subjoined Schedule, it will be seen that portions of this Tramway will pass through narrow thoroughfares, unsuited for Tramway purposes. In order to meet this objection, the Company proposes, at Hill Street, to take powers to widen the same on the west side, from opposite Frankton Road to Peckham High Street. This will be an important improvement, in a local point of view. Detail plans, and other information should be hereafter provided, in order that this scheme may be thoroughly considered. Duplicate lines of metals. It is proposed, at the Old Kent Road, and also in High Street, Peckham, to lay these new lines separate from, but immediately adjacent, and parallel with, those of the present lines of Tramway—instead of 25 ing, what I consider to be the far less objectionable method—viz.: That of the new Company obtaining running powers over the existing lines. I am of opinion, that these duplicate lines will lead to practical inconvenience, and probably danger to the traffic, therefore, I recommend the alternative to be adopted; to which I see no practical objection in the carrying out. The fact of Railway Companies, in many parts of the Kingdom, having duplicate powers on the same line of Railway is, I think, an instance in support of this suggestion. I observe this Bill, a Clause is inserted, authorizing the Company (for temporary purposes) to make Tramways in adjacent streets during the progress of works and repairs. This is a license which must be carefully guarded, if permitted at all. Temporary use of adjacent Roads during repairs, &c. Another Clause also seeks to give the Company power to dispose of surplus material from the road after making the Tramway and repairing the margins. This is contrary to all former Power to claim and dispose of surplus Road Material. 26 custom (at least in this Parish) as I have not, hitherto, permitted the removal of any surplus material, but have claimed the same as the property of the Vestry. Purchase of Peckham and East Dulwich Tramway. This Company proposes to take power, to purchase or lease the authorized lines of last year called the "Peckham and East Dulwich Tramways."

This is a proposal, to make alteration in the present Tramway in the Camberwell New Road, by substituting for the present single line, a double line of Tramway. This, I am of opinion, will be a great improvement, as it will avoid the present inconvenient loops, and will afford unintermittent traffic along the whole line of Tramway. Camberwell New Road substitution of double for single line of Tramway. A Schedule, shewing the width of Roads and Footpaths, in the portion to be laid in this Parish is appended. Peckham High Street, Loop at Rye Lane, for short traffic. This is a proposition to form a loop in the Peckham High Street (opposite the end of Rye Lane) in order to afford the means of changing 28 the Traffic, from the down to the up line, when not required to continue the service beyond such point. Although this will be a great improvement on the system now frequently adopted, of having dead ends to Tramway lines—necessitating the shifting the horses each journey—nevertheless, care must be Cars must not be allowed to stop here, taken that stringent clauses be introduced to prevent the cars from stopping at this point, otherwise, the great improvement, lately carried out, by the widening of this thoroughfare by the Metropolitan Board of Works will be neutralized. Width next kerbs. Also, that the required width from the kerb line, must be preserved at all parts of this loop, if permitted to be laid. Southwark and Deptford Bill, 1883. Further, it should be noted that the "Southwark and Deptford Tramways Bill,'' forming a part of the present Report, proposes a Junction, with the authorized line of last year at this place. I apprehend it will not be possible to comply with both these proposals. Maintenance and repairs, etc. A clause is introduced as to maintenance and repair of portions of respective Streets, 29 &c., traversed by proposed Tramways. This requires further elucidation. Also a clause (similar to that referred to in this Report on another scheme) of an intention to claim and dispose of surplus materials from the Public Roads, after breaking up for Tramway works. This will require consideration. Disposal of surplus material by Company. There is a Clause also, referring to Rating, to which I draw attention. Rating Tramways. Sidings and Crossings, other than those shewn on Plans. Power is sought to be conferred upon the Company to construct these. I think the permission of the Vestry should be first obtained; also as to the user of roads, other than those occupied by the proposed Tramways. Sidings, crossings, and use of Public Roads.

November. 1882, J. Kincaird Thos. Floyd) Engineers. Tahourdins & Hargreaves, Solicitors, I Victoria Street, Westminster, S. W. This is a proposition for a Tramway to be laid down in the Gipsy House Road (in Lambeth Parish), near to the Paxton Hotel, and from thence passing along the following roads within the Parish of Camberwell, viz.:—Victoria Road or Dulwich Wood Park, College Road, and the road in front of the Crystal Palace, terminating opposite the Crystal Palace High Level Railway Station, in the last mentioned road. The length within this Parish will be about three-fourths of a mile. The gradients of these Roads are very steep, being on an average 1 in 20; therefore the haulage up this steep ascent will be considerable. Route Gipsy Hill, Victoria Road or Dulwich Wood Park, to Crystal Palace. This Tramway will be a double line, with D 2 36 exception of a short length of single line, about seven chains between Kingswood and Farquhar Roads, and a short length also, about five chains at the upper end of College Road, at the junction with the main Road, here called the "Palace Road."

This is a proposition by the same Company, to form connections with the authorized Tramway line of last year, at Denmark Hill, near to Camberwell New Road. By arrangement then made with the Vestry, a loop line at this point was authorized to avoid the necessity of an abrupt Stopping Station, and which in my last year's report I stated was undesirable. If the present proposition is acceded to, the main line of the London Southern Tramway from Denmark Hill, will join the present London Tramways system at Camberwell Green, and will then lead direct to London, and also to Peckham. This alteration will prevent inconvenience in the working of the respective lines at this spot, and render unnecessary the authorized loop line above referred to. Proposed Junction at Denmark Hill with London Tramways. These Clauses will require arrangement and consideration. Clauses, re repairs other than by Tramway Company, and the temporary user of streets other than site of Tramway. Note.—This proposition was subsequently withdrawn from Parliament. 38 CROYDON AND LONDON EXTENSION RAILWAY. Session 1883. Cope & Co., Solicitors, 3 Great George Street, Westminster, S. W. The portion of this proposed line of Railway as relates to this Parish, commences at or near the Dulwich station, on the south side of Thurlow Park Road, crosses Acacia Grove, and Croxted Road, near the Junction of these two roads (by skew bridges), and also the Park Road, opposite to Smith's Nursery, where it enters the Parish of Lambeth. Route of proposed line out of L. C. and Dover Railway at Thurlow Park Road to Croxted Road and Park Road. Bridges over Public Roads, etc. Acacia Grove it is proposed to bridge over by an arch 25 feet span and 15 feet high. Croxted Road by an arch 40 feet span, 15 feet high. Neither of these proposed Bridges will meet the requirements of the neighbourhood, and must therefore be opposed. The Metropolitan Board of Works is the authority to 39 enforce this opposition, as well as all other protection of the Public rights. The width &c. of Roads to be crossed above referred to is as follows:— WIDTH OF ROADS, &c. Footpath. Roadway. Footpath TOTAL. South side North side ft. in. ft. in. ft. in. ft. in.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. Beyond the various points to which I have alluded in the foregoing report, it will be necessary for the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the Vestry, to impose General Clauses and conditions—required for the protection of the Public rights, and I would again refer especially, 40 to several of the Tramway Company's propositions relating to the question of:— General observations. 1st. Repairs by authorities "by arrangement." 2nd. Temporary use of streets not occupied by the Tramways. 3rd. Power to make sidings and turnouts to stables, etc. 4th. Rating Clauses. And I would draw attention also, to the necessity of Paving all margins which may be under the statutory width of 9-ft. 6-in.; also as to the sale of surplus material from the public roads, after repairs by the Company, as proposed in the foregoing Bills. J. C. REYNOLDS, Surveyor. This report was duly considered by the Vestry and the decision in each case duly reported to the Metropolitan Board of Works. In no case did the Vestry deem it necessary to appear by Counsel before the Parliamentary Committees. 41 PECKHAM RYE, GOOSE GREEN, NUNHEAD GREEN, and LAND near PECKHAM RYE. The Metropolitan Board of Works having obtained the powers sought for (as reported last year) in their "Various Powers" Act, the transfer of these Commons to that Board having been duly carried out and the same are now under their control. CAMBERWELL GROVE GATES. The Gates at the upper end of Camberwell Grove, shutting off Grove Hill Road (formerly Grove Hill) which since the adoption of the latter Road by the Vestry had become broken and dangerous were removed—thus a direct communication has been opened between these two public thoroughfares. PAVING TRAMWAY MARGINS. The uncompleted portions of the main Roads, which were not paved by the Vestry out of the 42 loans of £12,500—pending the carrying out of the Metropolitan Improvements in High Street, Peckham—have now been completed by arrangement with the Metropolitan Board's contractor, with the exception of a small portion at Queen's Road, at Pemels Place, where the Metropolitan Board have had to suspend their operations in respect to the Improvements. So soon however as this is completed, this portion will be also executed— affording a continuous paved road throughout the whole length of Parish Road, extending near Camberwell Gate to the Boundary at Pomeroy Street. STREET NOMENCLATURE. Orders having been received from the Metropolitan Board of Works for Re-naming or Renumbering the following Streets, the notices have been served, and the necessary alterations supervised by the Officers of the Vestry:— Friern road .. Re-numbered. Ulverscroft road .. Re-numbered. Lower Park road .. .. Re-numbered. 43 Malfort road .. Re-numbered. Bromar road .. Re- numbered. Toulon street (late Nelson street) Re-named. Re-numbered.

Improved central Lamps have been erected in several places in the Parish, as below, and it is intended to extend them at various centres and positions of importance during the coming season:— Lamps already fixed. Cost each per ann. £ s. d. 1 Lamp on Urinal, Camberwell Green 15 15 0 The ordinary Street Lamp, burns 5 cubic feet per hour, at a cost per annum of £3 17s. including repairs. 2 do. next Drinking Fountain, Camberwell Green 8 1 0 1 do. opposite "Tysons," Church street 6 15 0 1 do. opposite end of Rye-lane, in Peckham High street 15 15 0 1 do. on Urinal, Peckham High street, opposite end of Hill street 15 15 0 44 It has been deemed desirable to reduce the space between the present Lamps in Roads of considerable Traffic, the present spaces now varying from GO to 75 yards apart; this alteration will be carried out only in main thoroughfares, where considered absolutely necessary. The following Table will shew the No. of Lamps with ordinary burners now lighted at the cost of the Vestry:— Company providing the supply. No. of Lamps lighted at Lady-day, 1882 New Lamps erected to Lady-day, 1883 Total No. of Lamps at Lady-day, 1883 South Metropolitan Gas Company 2,558 37 2,595 Crystal Palace District Gas Company 144 0 144 2,702 37 2,739 The Companies contract to light, clean, and keep in repair all the Lamps as above mentioned. The annual charge per Lamp for which including the supply of Gas is as follows:— South Metropolitan Gas Company £3 17 0 Crystal Palace Gas Company £4 5 0 45 In each case a discount of 5 per cent. is allowed for prompt quarterly payment. The columns, lanterns, &c. are provided and erected complete by the Companies for the sums of £3 and £3 10s. respectively each Lamp column, inclusive of fittings. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. In the month of November last, Parliamentary notices and plans were deposited with the Vestry by the Metropolitan Brush Electric Light Company, proposing to light by Electricity some of the most thickly populated portions of this parish, together with a portion of the upper Dulwich District, including the Crystal Palace, thus joining for Electric Lighting purposes, the parishes of Camberwell and Penge. The Electric Lighting Act of 1882, having given to parishes the option to adopt Electric Lighting on their own account, or by arrangement with Companies, the whole matter was fully gone into by the committee specially appointed by the Vestry, when after much discussion it was resolved not to undertake the work by means of 46 Vestry manufacture. It then became necessary, to place such restrictions and control upon the Electric Lighting Company which proposed to parcel out the parish for the purposes above referred to, as should prevent that Company from gaining a monopoly unfavourable to the Parish, in respect, not only to the Parochial Lighting, but also in the interests of private consumers—these conditions were exhaustively considered and eventually forwarded to the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade subsequently issued a code of regulations or "model clauses," under which the companies would be controlled in carrying out Electric Lighting under their statutory powers. These again were most stringently considered by the Special Committee, and were then submitted to the Company. Upon further consultation with the Committee the Company declined to proceed further with the matter. It may be remarked that this suspension of the adoption of Electric Lighting in this parish, for the present at least and until it is better understood, has prevented an unnecessary outlay of public money, and has further rescued the parish, from the demands of a company which sought to obtain advantages wholly outside the interests and necessities of the parish. 47 FORMATION OF NEW STREETS. The Metropolitan Board of Works having consulted the Vestry upon 12 applications for sanction to the formation of 15 New Streets within this Parish, the same were examined into and reported upon by the Surveyor, and the Vestry recommended seven and disapproved two. In one case the Vestry left the decision to the Board, and two applications were withdrawn. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its approval of eight applications for 11 Roads. LINES OF FRONTAGE, PROJECTIONS, &c. The Metropolitan Board of Works also submitted for the opinion of the Vestry 30 applications for Lines of Frontage, Projections, &c. Each case was examined and reported upon by the Surveyor; the Vestry recommended 17, and disapproved 12 of these cases. The Metropolitan Board of Works subsequently notified its approval of 18, and disapproval of 11 cases: one application being withdrawn. 48 In all approved cases, upon the works being carried out, supervision has been given thereto by the Vestry Officers. METROPOLITAN STREET IMPROVEMENTS. Camberwell Road. Church Street. High Street, Peckham, and Queen's Road. Record can now be made of the completion of the long anticipated scheme of widening the main Roads. To the energy and determination of the member at the Metropolitan Board of Works, E. Dresser Rogers, Esq., this has been mainly due, and also the street widths originally intended as 50-ft. have been increased to 60-ft. The above gives a Road of grand dimensions, and when the new Buildings are completed, Camberwell will possess on its western boundary a main road of about three miles in length, in appearance equal to any in South London. 49 DRINKING FOUNTAINS & CATTLE TROUGHS. During the past year the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association have maintained the various Cattle Troughs &c. in the parish. The Vestry pay a contribution of £5 per annum to the Association towards the cost of the Water Supply, which now has to be paid for. The Public Drinking Fountains and Cattle Troughs, included as above are as follows:— Drinking Fountains. Cattle Troughs.

REPORT OF THE SEWERS & SANITARY COMMITTEE. For the Year ending LADY-DAY, 1883. 87 The Sewers and Sanitary Committee Beg to submit for the information of the Vestry the following Report of Works carried out under their department during the year ending Ladyday, 1883. NEW SEWERS. The following Sewers have been constructed by the Vestry during the past year, being public works. Pipe Sewers. 18-in. 12-in. Feet. Feet. James Street 162 Basing Road 130 Denmark Hill 540 Peckham Rye 2,626 * Forest Hill Road 200 Total Lengths 3,366 292 * A moiety of the cost of this work was paid by the owner of the adjacent property. 88 NEW SEWERS IN "NEW STREETS." The undermentioned Sewers have been executed by the Vestry, and the cost thereof charged to the Owners of the property abutting upon such streets. Pipe Sewers. 18-in. 12-in. Feet. Feet. Tappesfield Road 76 Norfolk Street 90 Underhill Road 76 Etherow Street 350 Hall Road, Newlands 1,140 Total Lengths 1,140 592 NEW SEWERS ON NEW ESTATES. Previous to executing works of sewerage in roads about to be formed in building estates, it is required that the Plans and Sections should be submitted to the Vestry by the respective owners for approval, which being accorded, such plans and sections are submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works for their sanction. The works are then carried out by the applicant under the supervision of the officers of the Vestry. 89 The following is a schedule of works so submitted during the year now under report. Pipe Sewers. 18-in. 15-in. 12-in. Feet. Feet. Feet. Caspian Street, New Church Road 250 Raul Road, Hanover Park 270 Loder Street, Old Kent Road 210 East Dulwich Grove, Lordship Lane 357 Ivydale Road, Nunhead 2,990 Dayton Grove, Queen's Road 477 Terriswood Road, Dulwich 160 325 Total Lengths 3,347 160 1,532 The total length of sewer executed under all the foregoing heads has been about two miles. NEW GULLIES. The number of Gullies for road drainage constructed in connection with the foregoing works has been 138. HOUSE DRAINAGE. This important branch of your Committee's operations has received very special attention; 90 regulations have been introduced with a view to the adoption of improved sanitary measures and appliances, and careful supervision has been directed to the subject. 305 applications have been received for the drainage of 892 houses into the sewers, and the works in connection therewith have received the necessary inspection. GULLY CLEANSING. This work is receiving constant attention. The number of gullies cleansed and disinfected has been 3,600. SEWER CLEANSING. All the main sewers under the control of the Vestry, are regularly flushed and cleansed by labourers in the employ of the Vestry—the heavy deposit being removed by casting. The quantity of soil so removed has been 194 loads. REMOVAL OF DUST. This work is carried out as before by means of the plant, horses, &c. of the Vestry. The dust 91 when collected, is barged away or otherwise disposed of, and in order to facilitate this work of barging, a portion of the Glengall Wharf (lately acquired by the Vestry) has been appropriated for the purpose; thus a large quantity is conveyed direct from the carts into the barges. The number of barge loads so removed from this wharf is given below, as also the total quantity collected within the parish during the past 12 months. The Vestry undertakes to fill the barges; the barge owners neither receiving nor paying any thing for the dust, but the latter pay all canal and such like dues and charges. A portion of the dust collected is when practicable, otherwise disposed of, realizing from the parties to whom it is sold the sum shewn in the appended account; a further part also of the collected dust is disposed of to a contractor who provides truck accommodation for the same at the Bricklayers Arms Railway Station, Old Kent Road. The amount realized by the sale of the dust, it will be seen, is yearly decreasing, owing to the diminished demand for it in the local brick yards surrounding the area of collection. Hence the necessity of deportation of the material to further 92 distances from the parish, and that the cost of removal will continue to increase in future years is, for the above reasons, not to be doubted. However the means now at the disposal of the Vestry—viz. the wharf accommodation and the arrangements made for barging—afford a ready outlet for the dust removal; preventing any cause of anxiety as to the creation of nuisances in the parish—which was apprehended had the sifting and separation system been adopted. All dust brought on to the premises is taken away direct, and up to this time no complaint has been made in reference thereto. The quantity of dust collected during the past year was 18,552 loads. The number of Barge-loads freighted from the Vestry wharves was 207. The cost of the collection as above including all charges for plant, fodder, labor &c. was £3,779 0 10 Less sale of Dust, 308 13 8 Total cost £3,470 7 2 The amount above stated is inclusive of the purchase of additional plant, repairs, &c.—this 93 divided by the number of loads collected gives three shillings and nine pence per load, which compares favorably with that formerly paid by the Vestry, viz. five shillings and six pence per load. The number of Horses at present employed in this work is 20. The Dust Stud is in good working order and healthy condition. PUBLIC URINALS. These conveniences, erected by and under the charge of the Vestry, are regularly cleansed by the labourers in the Vestry's employ. The water for flushing purposes is supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, at an annual charge of £6 each. The following is a list of such urinals: 1. Camberwell Road. 2. Wyndham Road. 3. Addington Square. 4. Old Kent Road. 5. Wells Street. 6. Southampton Street. 7. Sumner Road. 8. Peckham High Street. 9. Peckham Rye. 94 The Reports of your Medical Officer and Public Analyst are appended, shewing the various sanitary measures carried out in their departments. 95 1883-83. MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Gentlemen, I commence my Annual Report as I generally do, with quotations from the Registrar General's Annual Summary; with the object of placing before you, for comparison with our own statistics, his results with respect to the populations, birth-rates, death-rates, and prevalence of the more important Zymotic or infectious diseases in London and the several groups of districts into which London is divided. The populations of London and its five groups of districts, as determined at the census taken in the early summer of 1881, were as follows: TABLE I. London. West D. North D. Central D. Eastern D. South D. 3,816,483 669,633 905.947 282,238 692,738 1,265,927 96 The numbers have of course increased since then; and in the middle of 1882 it is calculated that the population of London had risen to 3,893,272. The populations of the several groups of districts had also undergone a change, though, severally in different proportions to the increase of the whole Metropolis: but what exactly was the estimated population of each of these groups in the middle of 1882, I do not know. The following table shews the births and deaths, and the birth-rates and death-rates per 1000, in 1882, for London as a whole and the several groups of districts. TABLE II. London. West D. North D.

The death-rate was (as it always is) different for the different localities. It is usually highest in the Central and Eastern districts, and lowest in the Western districts; and so it proved in 1882. The mortality in the Southern districts was very little in excess of that in the Northern or even the Western districts. The Mortuary rates were a little higher than those of 1881, but they were nevertheless low. Judged of by them the health of the Metropolis was good in 1882. TABLE III. Hooping Cough. Measles.

From the table it will be seen that during the year 1882 Hooping-cough and Diphtheria were unusually fatal; that, as compared with the preceding year, there was some diminution in the mortality from Measles, Scarlet Fever, and the group of so called "continued" Fevers; and that the mortality from Small Pox had undergone very great reduction. It will be observed also that all these diseases caused more deaths in the South, than in any other of the groups. It must be recollected, however, that the population of the South is nearly as large as that of the East and West districts combined; that it is almost four times as large as that of the Central districts; and that it is about one-third larger than the North. There is no doubt however, unfortunately, 99 that Small Pox has been, as it has been for some years past, unduly prevalent in South London. The subjoined table gives the populations of Camberwell and its several sub-districts, as they were ascertained at the Census of 1881, and the populations, which (on the assumption that the numerical rate of progress has continued the same since the Census as it was during the previous 10 years,) were calculated to have been present in the middle of 1882.

The difference, which however is unimportant, depends on the fact (which renders absolute agreement impossible) that the increase H 2 100 of each district, as also that of the entire Parish, has been calculated on independent data. During the year 3,577 boys, and 3,410 girls, in all 6,987 children, were born in the Parish; of which 90 were born in Dulwich, 2,221 in Camberwell, 2,688 in Peckham, and 1,988 in St. George's. The births were more numerous than those registered in the previous year, as will be seen from the accompanying table. TABLE V. Dulwich. Camberwell Peckham. St.George's.

The birth-rates per thousand were as follows;— 101 TABLE VI. Duhvich. Camberwell. Peckham. St. George's. Parish. 15.5 34.7 35.4 35.3 35.1 The differences of birth-rates, presented by the different sub-districts, are remarkable, and in accordance with the statement already made, that births specially abound amongst relatively poor populations. The deaths registered during the year amounted to 3,778, of which 1,891 were of males and 1887 of females. 51 occurred in Dulwich, 1,311 in Camberwell, 1,401 in Peckham, and 1,015 in St. George's. It must be remarked however that, of the 1,311 assigned to Camberwell, 260 occurred in the Workhouse, and 92 in the Lunatic Asylums, making a total of 352 deaths registered in Camberwell, but not properly belonging to this district more than to the other districts of the Parish. In order to determine the death-rates of the sub-districts, it is necessary to distribute these proportionately among all the sub-districts. This has been done in the 102 accompanying table; the last column of which presents the corrected returns. TABLE VII. District. Deaths re.turned. Deaths in W.& L. A. Deaths of those of W. & L.

It must be borne in mind, however, that all last year's rates, not only those for our own Parish but those for the country generally, were unprecedentedly low, and scarcely likely to be maintained. The deathrates present much the same local variations as the birth-rates. In Dulwich, the healthiest, the least populous, and the best to do part of the parish, the death-rate is remarkably low; while Camberwell, which lies in these respects between Dulwich on the one hand, and Peckham and St. George's on the other, occupies an intermediate position also as regards its death-rate. But again, as I have before shown, the low birth-rate of Dulwich has an important influence over the low death-rate of that district; and the comparatively high birth-rates of the other parts of the parish influence their death-rates very appreciably, and in an unfavorable sense. Table IX exhibits in detail the returns of births and deaths for the year, arranged both according to districts, and according to seasons. 104 It gives also the ages at death and the more important causes of death. A few points of interest appear on attentive examination and comparison of the figures comprised in it. 1st. on looking at the ages at which death occurred, it will be seen how large a proportion of the total number of deaths is due to children under five years of age. No less than 1,033 deaths, out of 3,778, occurred in children in their first year, and 770 in children between 1 and 5; or, in other words, very nearly half the total number of deaths occurred during the first five years of life. Infantile mortality was indeed unusually heavy during the year. It may be worth while to note, on the other hand, that no less than 327 deaths occurred between the ages of 70 and 80, 128 between 80 and 90, and 18 between 90 and 100. 2nd. As to cause of death. 77 deaths were attributed to accidental or other violence, including suicide; 321 either to premature birth, or to conditions dependent immediately on feebleness of health dating from birth; and 28 to childbirth.

Deaths in Lunatic Asylums, 92-(51 male, 41 female). 105 Bronchitis, pneumonia, and other inflammatory affections of the lungs, caused 710 deaths; diarrhoea and other such disorders 100. Pulmonary inflammations were fatal mainly in the first and last quarters of the year; diarrhoea, as a fatal disease, is almost always a phenomenon of the later summer, and indeed 65 out of the whole number of cases were fatal in the third quarter of the year. Its mortality was considerably under the average in 1882, and a great deal less than it had been in 1881. Tubercular diseases are always largely fatal, and deaths attributable to them amounted to 595; nearly a hundred more than were registered in the previous year. The so called zymotic disorders are always of special interest; partly because they are exceedingly variable in their prevalence; partly because collectively they cause, as a general rule, a heavy addition to the death-rate; and partly because they are to some extent preventable. 106 Deaths due to the chief disorders included in this category, including all diarrhœal disorders, are given, not only for the year 1882 in the general table (IX), but for every year since the Vestry came into existence in table X, and in quarterly aggregates for the last six years in table XI. From table X the variations of each included disease, year by year, from the time when the Vestry came into existence may be learnt; while table XI shows how during the last six years, this prevalence has had relation to seasons. It must be borne in mind, however, in considering these tables, that the actual numbers of deaths are given, and not the numbers relative to population; and that the population has increased more than three-fold between 1856 and 1882. From these tables it will be seen, that Hooping-cough, which caused 180 deaths, was much more fatal than it was in 1881, and that it prevailed especially in St. George's, and during the first three months of the year; that measles, which was fatal in 168 instances, was much more fatal than it has ever been in the parish before, and that it was most fatal in Peckham, and during the first and 107 second quarters of the year; that diphtheria, which destroyed 60 lives, was attended by a much heavier mortality than we have ever yet experienced, that it occurred chiefly in Camberwell and Peckham, and with equal severity in the first, second and fourth quarters; that scarlet fever showed considerable diminution, and prevailed rather more in Peckham than in Camberwell or St. George's, and was least fatal in the second quarter; that fever (which term probably comprises cases of enteric fever mainly) showed exactly the same mortality as in the previous year, and affected chiefly Camberwell and Peckham, occurring in largest proportion in the second and fourth quarters ; and lastly that deaths from small-pox fell off in a most remarkable and satisfactory manner, the deaths from this disease being only 66, as compared with 190 in 1881. Small-pox prevailed mostly in Peckham and diminished from the beginning to the end of the year; the deaths in the first quarter being 33, in the second 21, in the third 3, and in the last quarter 9. These figures relating to small-pox include all the deaths due to the parish occurring in the asylum hospitals. 108 I need not add to the remarks I have just made; excepting only a few words in reference to small-pox and diphtheria. The epidemic of small-pox, which had been so serious for Camberwell of late years, and more especially in 1881, fortunately for us died out early in the year 1882; and we have reason to hope that new arrangements in respect of the admission of small-pox into the Deptford Hospital will materially reduce, if it do not put an end to, the danger, which we, as I believe rightly, attributed to its presence on our borders. Diphtheria, as I have pointed out, has been much more fatal in the parish than we have ever known it before; and, as I have also shown, it has equally been of unprecedented fatality throughout London. What special causes for its spread there may have been or may be I do not venture to guess ; but it must be recollected that diphtheria (like measles, small-pox, scarlet fever, and the like) is a contagious disease, and therefore liable, like these others, to fluctuations of alternate slight and serious prevalence. It is such a wave of increased prevalence which seems to have been passing 109 over us last year, and not yet to have left us. One main reason why I speak of the subject now is, that the considerable incidence of this disease, extending over some months in a particular district of the parish, led one of the medical practitioners of the parish, Dr. Ure, to address an important letter to me on the subject early in this year ; in which he was disposed to attribute the prevalence of diphtheria in his neighbourhood to certain local causes of insalubrity which he specified. I felt it to be my duty to ask him for fuller information, which he kindly gave me; and this, as I think, fully confirmed his assertion with respect to the undue prevalence of the disease. Therein he shows that, in 19 months, from Aug. 1st 1881 to March 1st 1883, he had in his own practice, in 27 streets, no less than 155 cases of the disease. Now even if it be admitted (as I am inclined to believe) that a great many of these cases were either cases of scarlet fever or of non-specific sore throat, there is no reasonable doubt that the majority of them were truly diphtheritic. And since fatal cases of diphtheria were much more numerous in the subdistrict of Camberwell, than they were in the locality to which Dr. Ure draws attention, we may take this fact, I think, as a proof that the many fatal 110 cases of diphtheria occurring in the parish were associated with a much larger number that were not fatal, and never came to our knowledge. It is well known that, serious and fatal as diphtheria is apt to be, it is often a very mild disease, and hence apt to be overlooked—a matter of some importance, when we consider that the mild cases spread disease as well as such as are severe. I may add that, considering that the chief mortality from diphtheria in the parish occurred away from such nuisances as Dr. Ure was inclined to attribute the disease to, I see no sufficient reason to adopt his suggestion as to its causation. The nuisance however of which he complained was remedied at the time of his complaint, otherwise I might have been disposed to discuss the matter at greater length. In concluding this part of my report, I may remark that, apart from the undue prevalence of three or four of the zymotic diseases to which I have called special attention, the health of the Parish, as shewn both by the death-rates and by the character of the mortality, has been particularly good. When my last report was issued, the report of the Commission appointed to enquire respecting 111 small-pox and fever Hospitals had not been published. This report has since then been brought under the notice of the Vestry, and I doubt not that many of you have made yourselves masters of the conclusions at which the Commission arrived. It was fully admitted by them that the large Asylum Hospitals in London had been proved to be in some way or the other centres of contagion, and sources of danger to the neighbourhoods in which they were placed; and, while acknowledging (as doubtless most persons will allow) the need of Hospitals for the reception of small-pox, and therefore recommending the maintenance of such Institutions, they made a series of practical recommendations with the object both of securing efficiency and minimising danger. These recommendations are so important, and I think judicious, that I venture to reproduce them here:— "And now it will be convenient to preface our further recommendations by a recapitulation of those we have already made. "We are of opinion that the provision of hospital accommodation for persons suffering from infectious disease in the metropolitan districts should be entirely disconnected from the 112 administration of the poor law, and treated as part of the sanitary arrangements of the metropolis. "We think that the conduct of the hospitals cannot be better placed than under the management of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with such changes in their mode of election as shall give the sanitary authorities of London—that is to say, the vestries, district boards. and commissioners of sewers—at least an equal influence with the guardians of the poor in the choice of the elective members o the board. "We think that every person suffering from an infectious disease, or those in charge of him, or, if these neglect their duty, the occupier of the house in which the sick person is residing, or if he is a pauper, his medical attendant, should be required by law to notify the nature of the disease to the medical officer of health so soon as they or any of them are aware of it; and that, in the case of nonpaupers, the medical attendant should, if it is inexpedient to impose any further obligation on him, be similarly required by law to furnish 113 the sick person, or those in charge of him, with a certificate of the nature of the disease, in the form which we have already suggested, to be by them communicated to the medical officer of health. On every certificate so communicated a small fee should be paid to the medical man who signed it. "If the medical officer after receiving such a certificate is satisfied that the patient can and will be properly isolated, and requisite means of disinfection adopted, the matter will proceed no further. "If he is not so satisfied, and if the sick person is not too ill to be removed, he will notify the case to the Metropolitan Asylums Board ; who will thereupon be at once and entirely charged with the patient until his complete recovery, and, in particular, will be empowered to remove him at once to one of their hospitals. So far no distinction should be made between paupers and non-paupers who cannot be isolated. But within the hospital those who are desirous of being placed in separate wards should be allowed such accommodation on paying for it. In case of ordinary accommo- I 116 can no longer be used, to anything like their present extent, for cases of small-pox, should, we think, become in the main fever hospitals. And we think it probable that with the aid of another hospital, which appears to be almost indispensable for the east of London, they would fully accommodate all the cases requiring London treatment. "By these arrangements cases of fever would be adequately provided for. "Of the 2,100 small-pox cases the mild, and with them the convalescent cases, being probably more than three quarters of the whole, should be provided for in two or three more country hospitals. "The remainder, being the severe cases during their acute stage, must be provided for in or within easy reach of London. " For these 400 or 500 persons who, being too ill to take a long land journey to the country hospitals, but at the same time not too ill to be removed from their immediate neighbourhood, cannot or will not be properly isolated by those in charge of them, we think, in the 117 first place, that administrative blocks with a few small wards attached to them might be maintained within the precincts of the fever hospitals, sufficient, in each hospital, for 30 or 40 small-pox patients; that the hospital authorities should divide the metropolis into hospital districts, assigning one to each hospital ; and that no hospital should receive small-pox patients except from the district in which it is situated. "This qualification is required not only because the patients will always be such as must be sent to the nearest hospital, but also to obviate, as far as the nature of the case admits of it, the great and natural complaint of those who are in the neighbourhood of large small-pox hospitals, that the infection of the rest of London is poured in upon them. "It is evidently of paramount importance that the areas of the small-pox wards as well as their administration should be rigorously separated from those of the fever hospitals, aud further, that their construction should be such as to reduce within the smallest limits the chance of spreading infection. We fully 118 lieve that contrivances for this purpose might be devised, and we again call special attention to the evidence on this head which has been furnished to us by Dr. Burdon Sanderson. This will provide for those cases which cannot be sent down the Thames. But we concur with Sir W. Jenner and Sir E. Currie in thinking that others—and in years of severe epidemic a larger number—might be sent down the river to hospitals in isolated situations on its banks, or if this is found impracticable, to floating hospitals on the river itself. For this opinion we have already given our reasons. "It is plain that under these circumstances small-pox or fever hospitals supported by parishes or unions, like those at Finchley and Plaistow, will become superfluous and they will probably become disused unless either of them should prove available as hospitals of the Asylums Board. Concerning hospitals supported wholly or in part by charity it was not within our duty to inquire, except in so far as facts observed in them might help to elucidate the questions put before us. It seems only right to record that we received evidence of 119 excellent management both in the Small-pox Hospital at Highgate and in the London Fever Hospital at Islington. We do not doubt that both these institutions have done excellent service to the public by their care of the sick and in diminishing the risks of infection by taking many from houses in which they could not be duly isolated. But we think it very doubtful whether the establishment of other hospitals of the same kind, either as charitable institutions or as places of reception for those who can pay, should be allowed unless they are to be subject to the general but effective supervision of the sanitary authority. "The foregoing suggestions are calculated to meet in some degree the intermittent character of small-pox visitations. If the hospital authorities had only to do with small-pox, they would have to collect a staff on occasion of each epidemic, and, if they did not wish to retain it in idleness, to break it up when the epidemic was passed, just as it had effectually learnt its work. The experienced officers being thus in a great measure lost, a fresh, and, from the nature of the case, a less perfect machinery 120 would have to be created when the next emergency occurred. The comparatively permanent fever establishments, however, will supply something in the nature of a cadre, which it will be comparatively easy to expand by the temporary engagement of fresh officers when the small-pox visitation arrives, and to reduce when it is passed. "With regard to matters of detail we have already recommended that the hospital authorities should have the entire control of the ambulances, by which all other modes of conveyance should be as far as possible superseded; that the regulations intended to prevent the communication of infection by visitors should be strictly enforced; that the entrance appropriated to the sick should be entirely separate from that of the tradesmen, contractors, and others; that letters should be carefully disinfected; that the nurses and attendants should not be permitted to leave the hospital except at longer intervals, and for proportionately longer periods; that great care should be taken respecting the exposure of infected clothes or bedding; and that the greatest 121 attention should be paid to the state of the drains in and around the hospital. To all these recommendations, mainly for the protection of the neighbourhood, we attach the highest importance, and in the general interest we express a hope that means may be taken to secure that the unprecedented mass of information which has already accumulated and is constantly increasing in the hands of the asylum's authorities may be so studied and methodized as to become available for the advancement of medical science." The work done by the Inspectors of Nuisances during the 12 months ending March 25th 1883, is given in tables XII and XIII. During this period 12,691 houses were inspected, and 6,058 re-inspections were made; 2,601 first notices and 205 second notices were served in respect of them; and in 19 cases only were Summonses required. There is very little in the matters dealt with to which particular attention need be called. It is noticeable however, that only 454 houses required 122 to be disinfected after infectious diseases, and only 452 lots of Bedding, Clothing &c., in place of 1,047 Houses, and 1,002 lots of Bedding and Clothing disinfected in the previous year. I beg leave in conclusion to add that the Inspectors have all, in my opinion, worked zealously and efficiently in the performance of their multifarious duties.

Precautionary Measures. 1.—All areas, basements, cellars, kitchens, and yards should be kept dry and clean, and if necessary, well lime-whited. 2.—All water-closets, sinks, and drains should be kept scrupulously clean, be regularly flushed with water, and have their traps in good order; they should also, if at all offensive, be kept flushed with solution of Sulphate of Iron or Carbolic Acid. 3.—All dust bins should be emptied at least once a week, and no unnecessary or undue accumulations of offensive matters should be permitted anywhere. Such accumulation should (pending their removal) be disinfected by the free use of Chloride of Lime. 4.—All water-butts and cisterns should be kept clean and well covered. 5.—All houses, and especially the sleeping apartments, should be kept clean and well ventilated. 6.—Overcrowding should be avoided as much as possible. 128 Measures to be taken when Small Pox or Fever of any kind is present. 1.—Every person suffering from Small Pox or Fever should be placed as early as possible under the care of a qualified Medical Practitioner. 2.—The patient should be at once separated, as efficiently as circumstances will permit, from the other inmates of the house, and if possible, should be placed in a top room. A sheet kept wet with a solution made by thoroughly mixing a quarter of a pint of Carbolic Acid, No. 4, with a gallon of water, should be hung up outside the door. 3.—All bed-curtains and other hangings, and carpets, and all articles of dress, &c., in wardrobes and cupboards, should be removed from the room. 4 —The patient's room should be well ventilated, but not needlessly draughty; windows should be kept partially open, and the communication with the chimney free. A fire generally aids ventilation. 5.—Pieces of rag, being inexpensive, should be used for wiping discharges from the mouth and nose, and should be immediately burnt after use. 6.—A basin, containing Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or some of a solution made by dissolving a pound of Green Copperas in a gallon of water, should be kept at hand to receive the patient's spit or vomit. 7.—The discharges from the bowels and kidneys should be received into vessels charged with the same disinfectants. 129 8.—A pail, also containing solution of Chloride of Lime, or of Condy's Fluid, or of Carbolic Acid, should stand in the room for the reception of all bed and body linen after removal from the person of the patient. 9.—All glasses, cups, and other utensils should be scrupulously cleaned before being used by others. 10.—The hands of the nurse should be washed with Carbolic Acid Soap, and rinsed in water containing Condy's Fluid : her dress should be of cotton. 11.—All articles of dress in use by the nurse or patient, and all articles of a like kind liable to be infected, should, before they are removed from the room in which the patient lies, be put into a solution of Chloride of Lime or Condy's Fluid, or Carbolic Acid, and should afterwards be washed and boiled, or burnt. 12.—The room should be thoroughly disinfected after it has been emptied. A good plan is to burn from a quarter to half a pound of brimstone in an iron dish, supported over a pail of water in the middle of the room, the doors, windows, and other outlets having been previously closed. The room should remain closed for twenty-four hours. CAUTIONS. 1.—If any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. k 130 2.—Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering, who so exposes the sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 3.—Any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has conveyed any such sufferer, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 4.—Any person who, without previous disinfection, gives, lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any bedding, clothing, rags, or other things that have been exposed to infection from such disorder, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Five Pounds. 5.—If any person knowingly lets any house, room, or part of a house in which a person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder has been, to any other person, without having such house, room, or part of a house, and all articles therein liable to retain infection, disinfected to the satisfation of a qualified Medical Practitioner, as testified by a certificate given by him, such person shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 6.—When any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, any Justice may, on a certificate signed by a legally qualified Medical Practitioner, order the body tc be removed to a mortuary at the cost of the Nuisance authority. 131 NOTICES. l.— If any Infectious Fever appears in any place information should be at once given at the Vestry Hall to the Medical Officer, or to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 2 —Complaints as to Nuisances should be made personally or by letter to the Inspectors of Nuisances, and as to Non-removal of Dust, to the Dust Superintendent at the Vestry Hall. 3.—Disinfectants may be had gratis on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 4.—A Disinfecting Apparatus has been provided by the Vestry at the Parish Stone Yard, Peckham Park Road, at which bedding and articles of apparel may be disinfected gratis, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. 5.—A Mortuary has been provided at Forest Hill Cemetery, whither dead bodies may be at once removed, and where they may remain until the time of burial, on application to the Inspectors of Nuisances. Dated 9th day of December, 1876. J. S. BRISTOWE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. k 2 133 1882-83. ANALYST'S REPORTS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, S.E., June 24th, 1882. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Gentlemen, During the past quarter I have analyzed thirtyfive samples of Milk and no fewer than thirteen in duplicate; several of these milks thus examined in duplicate, were so suspicious that although they did not offer cases for prosecution, they indicated the necessity for a more complex analysis than is usual. Ten of the milks were adulterated with respectively, 15, 10, 24, 13, 7, 23, 13, 13, 15, and 8 per cent. of water; several had been tampered with. 134 As is well known, considerable dissatisfaction is felt in the working of the Adulteration Act, with reference to the Court of Appeal and I wish once more to place upon record the strong opinions I entertain, that no certain judgment can be placed upon the original condition of a milk, from the condition of a stale sample. If the Public Analyst is not allowed to give a certificate for a milk unless he can certify that no change has taken place in the condition of the article that would interfere with the Analysis, for what reason should Somerset House be allowed to base its judgment upon a stale sample, and pronounce authoritatively upon its original character? The lowering of the standard of purity has very much injured the general character of milk although the public has benefitted by the Act. Farmers seem to recognise that they can generally water the milk some eight or ten per cent., forgetting that when they have done it, they leave to the vendors no power of further adulteration, and bring about prosecutions. Of eleven Butters, only one consisted mainly of fat, other than butter-fat, but several of them were 135 adulterated to a small extent. They will require careful attention, as the knowledge of adulteration, without detection, is becoming more and more of a science. It would be advantageous to the public to know something more about cheese. Water has again been analysed by me in my capacity as Public Analyst, although it does not fall within my province; some of the well waters border on those unfit for any use except for swilling floors and roads. One sample of Coffee consisted of more than one-half chicory. The Mustards were of fair quality; three out of four decidedly genuine and good, for, be it observed, a mustard may be genuine, but very poor. A Pepper and a Tea complete my list. Both samples were good of their kind. Michaelmas, 1882. During the past quarter, I have examined 25 fresh and four condensed Milks. Three of the 136 fresh milks were adulterated with respectively, 12, 13, and 30 per cent. of water, whilst 7 of them had under 5 per cent. of added water The condensed milks have a uniformity of composition which would be simply impossible, if the standard of Public Analysts were not according to knowledge. There is, indeed, a uniformity in the abstraction of butter, which proves what an art the manufacture has become. And so, also, with the dilution of milk. When Public Analysts are attacked for assuming a certain standard, it seems to be forgotten what large numbers of milk vendors escape prosecution, because the quantity of water added is beneath the notice of the Vestry. Thus, this quarter, twenty eight per cent. of the milk is adulterated, but no case is brought before the magistrates on account of the small quantity of water added. Milkmen are known to have added 10 per cent. of water, and to have rejoiced that they have not been found out, but they forget, when it suits them, that our standard has been framed to admit the possibility of a naturally poor milk. For the credit of many of the large vendors I would mention that some of their milks, sold in Camberwell, are excellent, and considerably above our standard, as indeed they ought to be. 137 For the first time in the last ten years, samples of Cheese have been analyzed. Certain statements have been made in Parliament and elsewhere, which necessitate a better knowledge. The four samples analysed contain no addition, except salt, to the milk employed. In No. 72, probably some skimmilk has been used; it is in every sense inferior to Nos. 65, 67, and 93. As regards Butter, five samples have been analyzed: one of these is not a butter, but an imitation. Several Extracts of Meat have also been analyzed for the first time, and, with all the varieties offered to the public, it is of no small importance that more should be known with reference to their composition. They are excellent stimulants, and might often replace with advantage alcoholic drinks. I consider No. 71 the best, where all are good. A Mustard, No. 70, was good for every purpose, both for external and internal application. The Spirits were without exception unadulterated with water. 138 As regards Gins, Juniper seems to have disappeared for flavouring purposes. No 76 was unsweetened, and flavoured with a little cinnamon; No. 62 was sweetened, and slightly aromatic. In both cases the spirits was of good quality, and free from all metallic contamination. Whiskeys, two in number, differed very little in alchoholic contents, containing respectively 84 and 85 per cent. of proof spirit. No. 60 contained a distinct trace of lead, but otherwise was a spirit of superior quality. No 100 was a genuine smoky whisky; both whiskeys were free from sugar. A sample of Rum contained upwards of 84 per cent. of proof spirit. It may not be uninteresting to remind you that 84.2 per cent. of proof spirit is equal to 40.75 per cent of absolute alchohol. Roughly we may say that proof spirit contains rather more than half its weight of water. Lastly as to Brandies. Three have been analyzed, two of them contained respectively, 84 and 86 per cent. of proof spirit, Nos. 68 and 89 were perfectly free from all metallic contamination. No 89 contained a little cream of tartar from wine, and probably a little wine residue from distillation. No. 102, differed from the other 139 brandies, in that it was alcoholically much stronger, containing no less than 92 per cent. of proof spirit. It contains more tanin than is usual and the spirit is somewhat coarse in character. There is no adulteration, but it is probably a new spirit. It is also alcoholically so strong, as to need the greater addition of water. In conclusion I may state that the certificates are in the hands of the Inspectors. Christmas, 1882. During the past Quarter I have analyzed thirty-five Milks; of these, twenty-one were good, three were below par, and eleven were adulterated with respectively, 27, 11, 15, 15, 21, 17, 20, 12, 32, 21, and 17, per cent. of water. One of these milks which was sold as skim milk, answered to the description, but was also watered to the extent of 20 per cent. When we compare the good milks with the adulterated, we are able to form a fair judgment of 140 their quality in the months of October, November and December. Instead of 9 per cent. of solids, not fat, which is the amount of solids taken as the basis of our calculation, we have an average of 9½ per cent. If this were remembered when a judgment is given upon a Milk adulterated with 10 per cent of water, there would be no room for the exhibition of such leniency as is shown in so many cases; I suppose 10 per cent. upon our standard, means the payment by the public of London of the sum of £400,000 as an additional Water Rate, so that even when the water is pure the tax is a heavy one. How unfair to the honest tradesman such leniency on the part of some, must be obvious to all. Only one milk has been forwarded by a Parishioner during the past quarter; this was adulterated with 19 per cent, of water. Besides the milks eight Butters have been analyzed; three were decidedly of the nature and quality demanded; one of the other five was sufficiently adulterated (with at least 40 per cent of added fat) to advise that it was not of the nature and quality demanded. In the other cases I have been obliged, from a former unpleasant experience, to allow a margin which I myself do not believe in. 141 But all these butters have been made up by a manufacturer, as they exhibit considerable scientific skill. A sample of Cream Cheese, was certainly of the nature demanded. So far, we have had no illustration of the adulterations of cheese said to be of American manufacture. A specimen of Mixed Pickles was every thing that could be desired in such an article. One sample of Brandy was sold as Whiskey; it was alcoholically very strong, nearly 5 per cent. above the standard. Such a spirit is very injurious unless much diluted with water. Of three Beers, little can be said. No 125 was alcoholically very strong, containing 12½ per cent, of proof spirit; its alcoholic strength covered its acidity. Beers are very much altering in character, and decidedly require further examination. It would greatly assist our investigations if we could be supplied with the names of the brewers who are supposed to furnish the liquors on draught. 142 Three Clarets and two other Red Wines complete my list. These wines have one very great advantage; they are very uniformly alcoholic ; they contain from 19 to 20 of proof spirit. Of the Clarets, No. 109 was the best; No. 124 was the worst The latter was heavily plastered, and every way a very inferior manufacture. The colouring matter was genuine; the astringency sufficient to satisfy the least fastidious. From the presence of iron and phosphoric acid, I presume the two other red wines to be of the kind called Carlowitz. The certificates are all in the hands of your Inspectors. Lady-Day, 1882. During the past quarter I have analyzed twenty-eight Milks. Of these seven were adulterated, with respectively, 8, 43, 20, 25, 18 and 20 per cent. of water. Besides these, five were not of the nature and quality demanded, although the amount of added water was too small to run the risk of a prosecution. In all such cases it is advisable to 143 take an extra sample, as otherwise it is probable that adulteration to a much greater extent would be practiced until the time came round for the new series of samples. It is but right to mention that some of the milks are undoubtedly genuine, by which I mean that there has been no lowering by the addition of water to bring them up to the so-called standard. Nos. 162, 178, 185, 186, and 200, answer to this description. Six Butters have been examined: of these two were condemned. No. 168 contained some seventy per cent. of added fat, and No. 192 was not butter at all. Of Breads, only two have been examined One of them required no analysis to condemn the physical characteristics, although in no other sense could one bring any accusation against it. The other bread contained a suspicion of alum, too small to notice. At the present time, in order to imitate good baking powders, and to realise great profits, certain baking powders have been introduced into the market in which the acid properties of alum are 144 made to realize the effects of the expensive tartaric acid upon the bi-carbonate of soda. This may become a trap to the baker, as by using a little excess of the powder he would bring himself within the operation of the Adulteration Act. A sample of Flour gave indications of alum which were not borne out by the analysis. With reference to certain varieties of Infants' Food of which three have been analysed, I cannot refrain from a very strong expression of opinion, that the labels should be diligently studied, and the advice rigidly followed, when milk is ordered to be admixed. If this injunction is not carried out, death from starvation would be the consequence, unless medical advice was sought in time, or the character of the food changed. These remarks apply only to the case where practically the food consists of starch. Of a Tea, I have nothing to remark, except that it was genuine. A Tomato-sauce was only characterised by containing a notable quantity of tin which it had taken from the case. 145 Of a Mustard I can only remark that, though genuine, it was more suited for internal than external application. And now as to alcoholic liquors. Two Porters and one Ale have been examined. No. 194 has been obviously brewed with sugar, as the main source of the alcohol. Of course I am quite aware that this is in accordance with law, but the amount of the chlorides of potassium and sodium is excessive, and is due to the quality of the sugar. There was very considerable difference in the alcoholic strength of these liquors, varying from 12 per cent. of proof spirit in ale (171), 8.38 per cent. in porter (194) and in porter 208 wherein there is only 6.87 per cent. Where the porter is good, the lower the per-centage of proof spirit, the more wholesome it is: There is an immense advantage in a food which has been cooked, and this applies notably to a drink. I believe nothing would promote sobriety so much as the production of a well-brewed table beer, made of genuine malt and hops, and with a quantity of proof spirit not exceeding four per cent. Of a Sherry I have nothing to say except that it was, as usual, plastered. I doubt whether L 146 any wine goes through more manipulation than sherry. Besides the ales porters, and sherry, five Spirits have been examined. The Gin contained very nearly sixty-nine per cent. of proof spirit, of very good quality. As sixty-five per cent. is the standard, there is nothing to complain of. May I be allowed to express a hope that those who drink it, do not forget the water. The Brandy contained nearly seventy seven per cent. of proof spirit, or nearly two per cent. above the standard. Whiskeys were three in number. No. 197 was exactly up to the standard (75 per cent.) ; No. 191 was eleven per cent. below the standard, and No 167 somewhat below. It will be seen that the analyses amount to fifty-two in number, and more than that number as regards the quality of the articles. Fourteen have been analyzed in duplicate. 147 The certificates are in the hands of the Inspectors. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS.

Dated this 28th day of May, 1883, and continued by adjournment until the 28th day of June 1883. W. P. Andrews, Chairman, Hy. Castle, W. R. Hillier, Frederick A. Rawlings, A.C.A. Auditors of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell, 201 REPORT of the AUDITORS to the VESTRY. Respecting the Accounts for the Year ending March 24th 1883. Vestry Hall, Camberwell, S.E., 28th June, 1883. Gentlemen, We beg- to report that we have pursuant to the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, duly audited and examined the Accounts of the Parish from the 26th March, 1882, to the 24th March, 1883, both dates inclusive; and find them to be perfectly correct. We deem it desirable to draw attention to the reports submitted to the Vestry from time to time by the Auditors, with respect to the mode adopted in the collection of rates in cases where only a portion is paid; we consider that if all receipts with respect to the same, emanated from the Accountant's Department of the Vestry, a remedy for the difficulty might be found: we feel it our duty to strongly urge this subject upon the attention of the Vestry, 202 especially looking to the fact that a large amount, nearly £18,000, appears chargeable as a deficiency in respect of empty properties throughout the Parish. We think it due to the Officers of the Vestry connected with the accounts, to testify to the very satisfactory manner in which the several books and vouchers have been kept and submitted to us. W. P.
