Paddington / METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OP THE VESTRY, FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1880. PADDINGTON. The Parish of Paddington, in the County of Middlesex, extends Northward from the Marble Arch to Kilburn Gate; and Westward from the Marble Arch to Kensington Palace Gardens; it is bounded on the North by Willesden; on the South by St. George's, Hanover Square, and St. Margaret, Westminster; on the East by Marylebone; and on the West by Kensington and St. Luke, Chelsea; its length from North to South being nearly Two Miles, and its superficial extent about 1,280 acres. The Parish is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to which Board it returns One Member; and its management is vested in Seventy-Two Elected Vestrymen, who meet at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month (the third Tuesday in August, and the first Tuesday in September excepted) for the transaction of their ordinary business. For parochial purposes the Parish is divided into Four Wards, the boundaries of which are as follow; viz.:— All that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of Harrow Road from the point at which the same intersects the boundary of the said Parish, and thence along the centre of such Road to a point directly opposite the centre of the Road on Westbourne Terrace Bridge, and thence along the centre of such Road WARD and of Westbourne Terrace, to the centre of one Bishop's Road, and thence Westward along the centre of Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the West boundary of the said Parish at the point where the same intersects the centre of Westbourne Grove, and thence Northward continuously along the said boundary to the point mentioned at the commencement of the foregoing description. 4 WARD TWO. 'All that portion of the said Parish which lies North of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace to a point directly opposite . the West end of the centre of Craven Road, and thence along the centre of Craven Road and Praed Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD THREE. All that portion of the said Parish which lies South I of Ward No. 1 and a line drawn from the boundary of such Ward Southward along the centre of Westbourne Terrace, Sussex Gardens, and Westbourne Street, and thence in a direct line to the boundary of the said Parish. WARD FOUR. All that portion of the said Parish winch is not comprised within the foregoing descriptions of the other Wards. •v. Under the Reform Bill of 1832, Paddington was united with the adjoining Parishes of St. Marylebone and St. Pancras, such incorporation being called the Borough of Marylebone, and returning Two Members to Parliament. In the year 1870, upon the passing of the Elementary Education Act, the Parish, together with St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were united into a District called the District of Marylebone, for the purposes of the School Board for London, such District returning Seven Members to the Board. There are at present in the Parish 15 Ecclesiastical Districts, viz.:— St. James', St. Saviour's, „ John's, „ Michael and All Angels, „ Mary's, Christ Church, Holy Trinity, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Paul's, „ Peter's, All Saints', „ Stephen's, St. Matthew's, „ Augustine's. „ Luke's, 5 The Parochial Workhouse is situated in the Harrow Road, near the Lock Hospital premises, its management being in the hands of Eighteen Guardians, elected annually, together with the resident Justices of the Peace. The Schools for the Workhouse children are at Ashford, near Staines; Paddington having been united by the Poor Law Board with St. George,Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District. The Cemetery for the Parish is at Willesden, and is managed by a Board consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry, such Board meeting at the Vestry Hall on the first Friday in each month. For Registration purposes, Paddington has been divided by the Registrar General into the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish; the St. Mary's District lying on the North, and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. For the purpose of providing the Parish with Public Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners have been appointed by the Vestry, and Baths in the Queen's Road were opened in May, 1874, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145. The Gas consumed in Paddington is supplied by The Gas Light and Coke Company, and the Water by two Companies, viz.:—the Grand Junction Waterworks Company and the West Middlesex Waterworks Company. The population, as shown by the Census taken in 1871, is as under, viz.:— Ward No. 1 21,793 „ „ 2 41,029 „ „ 3 18,469 ,, ,, 4 ... ... 15,522 Making a total of 96,813 The number of inhabited houses being 11,784. 6 The Rates levied since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act are as under, viz:— b. d. £ .

By order, FRANK DETHRIDGE, Vestry Clerk, Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, June 12th, 1880. REPORT OF THE WORKS EXECUTED IN THE PAYING & SEWERS DEPARTMENTS, % by GEORGE F. STEVENS, Surveyor. TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. • Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, 30th June, 1880. Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report of the various works executed, and of the principal official transactions in this Department during the year ended Lady-day, 1880. Highways. A further removal of macadamized roadways, and a substitution by wood blocks on a Portland cement concrete foundation have been effected in Radnor Place, Somers Place, Praed Street, and Cambridge Place. The total area of these works is 10,309 yards superficial, and the cost for concrete and wood pavement laid complete has been £4,597 3s. 7d., or about 8s. lId. per yard. The preparation of the ground to receive the concrete and wood blocks, and the laying thereof, were executed by the Vestry's workmen, under my superintendence, and 16 that of the Clerk of Works, without the aid of contractors. The requisite repairs of the channel paving, paved crossings, and roadways have been carried out, where necessary. In various parts of the Parish the footway-pavements were taken up, relaid, and repaired from time to time, as found to be requisite. The macadamized roadways (many requiring a coating of granite once every year) have been repaired in the usual manner, by diverting the vehicular traffic during the operations of one or more steam road rollers. A small addition to the Parish roads now makes the extent thereof 44 miles 2 furlongs and 64 yards. The continued openings made in the roads and footpaths by gas and water companies are still a source of much inconvenience to the public. The number of places repaired is 3386, and the cost of reinstating the pavements by the Vestry, and paid by the Companies, is £1022 lis. 9d. Buildings, Sewers, and Drains. The buildings erected during the year comprise 1 Board School, 2 large warehouses, and 269 dwell- 17 ing houses of various classes, for which notices have been received from builders and others, in compliance with the 76th section of Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and orders of Vestry for the drainage of such buildings have been served upon the parties concerned. For reference copies of the Orders are attached to the notices and deposited at the Vestry Hall. In the new streets sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works, two thousand nine hundred and twenty-one feet run of sewers, 1 brick thick, and of the capacity of 3"9' x 2'.6", have been constructed, together with side entrances and air openings thereto, by, and at the expense of private individuals, viz.:— Lydford Road, Barnsdale Road, Warlock Road (an additional portion), Ashmore Road, As a temporary measure one hundred and seventy-six feet of 9" pipe drain has been laid from the premises lately known as "Videon's Nursery " in Maida Vale, into the sewer in Clifton Road, at the expense of Mr. Ben. Davis, Nine and six inch stoneware pipe drains, as shown on plans of building notices, have been laid down 2 18 for the drainage of the new buildings, and the same have been trapped at their outlets into sewers at the expense of the owners. In consequence of the defective condition of sixty-nine old drains under the public roads and footways from houses and other buildings, which, on examination, it was found necessary to re-construct, the works for the same have been carried out by the Vestry's Contractor at the cost of persons requiring such re-constructions. The Vestry's Contractor has also completed five hundred and forty-nine distinct works, which include the above drains, repairs to sewers, construction of side entrances, with air openings to sewers, gulley drains, and catch pits, and fixing traps to outlets of gulley and house drains, at a cost of £2,103 7s. 9d. Of this amount the sum of £782 19s. 2d. has been received from builders and others for defraying the cost of the respective works done for them. Prompt attention has been given to one hundred and eighty-five complaints received, referring chiefly to stoppages in drains, or offensive smells arising therefrom. One hundred and twenty-seven examinations of house drains have been made from sewers, in reference to their general condition—namely, such as 19 alleged stoppages therein, and whether trapped at the outlets. In the majority of cases where, on examination, the drains were found stopped from some local cause which could be removed by drain rods from sewers, they have been so relieved. The applicants requesting these examinations, and who paid for them, were informed of the results of the examinations. Many of the large brick sewers are periodically cleansed by the removal of heavy deposits therefrom, and some of them flushed with water in addition thereto. The pipe and small brick sewers were also flushed with water whenever they required it, thereby conducing to their sanitary condition. One hundred and forty-nine cart loads of heavy deposits, which interfered with the free flow of the sewage, have been removed during the year from the sewers by the Vestry's workmen. There have also been 26,592 removals of road detritus from catch-pits and street gulleys, being at the rate of about 88 removals each day. Two thousand cubic yards of detritus have been taken from the catchpits, so that the rainfall could flow freely away from the roadways into the sewers. The seven public urinals are kept in a cleanly and efficient condition by workmen employed by the Vestry. 20 Further works of improvement to sewers and street gulleys have been carried out, viz.:— The construction of two side entrances to sewers in order to obtain easier access thereto for cleansing purposes, examining and unstopping drains, and other necessary works. The construction and re-construction of ninetytwo street gulleys, and the repair of forty others. Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses. The following Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works have been carried out in accordance with the 87th section of the Act of 1862. Date of Order. Locality. Subsidiary Names abolished.

BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, A necrological survey of Paddington in the year 1879 discloses a higher death rate than has obtained in any year since 1875. Assuming for the moment the correctness of each year's estimate of the population, and not doubting the accuracy in point of numbers of the death returns, the unwelcome fact above stated is indisputable. An examination, however, of the tables appended, will show that the higher death rate is due to the greater mortality from diseases of the respiratory organs, which were unusually fatal, the result of an exceptionally cold winter. In the case of persons aged sixty years and upwards, the death rate during the winter months is for the most part a question of temperature, as it is mainly determined by it. It is moreover not improbable that an estimate formed in 1879, and based upon data supplied by the census of 1871, is incorrect. Whether this be so or not the next census will declare. It is certain that in estimating the population the method 26 pursued by the late Registrar General, that is to say, "by adding to the population as enumerated at the last census a tenth of the difference between that number and the number obtained at the previous census for each year that has elapsed since the last census, and a fortieth of that difference for each odd quarter," is incorrect. It assumes an arithmetical instead of a geometrical progression in the increase of population. Notwithstanding the trouble and expense involved in numbering the people, it would be well, having regard to the importance of obtaining accurate vital statistics, which are necessarily based upon the numbers of a living existent population, if the census were taken in England every five years, as it is on the continent. A knowledge of the movements and distribution of populations, the recognition of the rapid growth of new industrial centres, and of the enlargement of old ones, of the continual influx and efflux of persons to and from the larger towns, and of the permanent drain by emigration, more particularly in times like the present, is necessary in order to ascertain each year the actual as distinct from the natural increase of population, and to determine with accuracy birth rates and death rates, and the multiform questions arising out of them— questions to statesmen, and to all who are charged 27 with the health of the people, of the highest importance, and demanding their first consideration. During the registration year of 53 weeks ending 3rd January, 1880, 2,912 births and 2,119 deaths were registered in Paddington. In the annexed tables 1,939 of these deaths are dealt with, the remaining 180 being those of non-parishioners. The recorded natural increase of the population from the excess of births over deaths was therefore 973. Assuming, as in former years, a further increase from the immigration of persons from other parts of London and from the country, the population in the middle of last year may be estimated at 113,629, allowing 74,496 to St. Mary's, and 39,133 to St. John's sub-districts. Of the 2,912 births, comprising 1,477 male and 1,435 female children, 2,180 were registered in the sub-district of St. Mary's, and 732 in that of St. John's. The proportion of the sexes was 100 males to 97 females—in the metropolis it was 100 males to 98 females. In St. Mary's the proportion was 100 males to 96 females, and in St. John's 100 males to 97 females. The births were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The 28 ratio of the births to the entire population of the parish was 1 birth to every 39 inhabitants, or a birth rate of 25.6 per 1,000 of the population. In St. Mary's sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 to 34 persons living, or a birth rate of 29.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In St. John's the ratio of births to the population was 1 to every 53 persons living, or a birth rate of 18.7. Some of the preceding particulars are shewn in the subjoined table:— Sub Districts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Bate per 1,000. St. John's 39,133 732 1 to 53 18.7 St. Mary's 74,496 2,180 1 to 34 29.3 Paddington 113,629 2,912 1 to 39 25.6 The birth rate for London was 36'5 per 1,000. The long-continued commercial depression allowing of fewer marriages is a probable explanation in part of the lower birth rate throughout the parish, and generally throughout England and Wales. The total deaths registered in Paddington were, as already stated, 2,119. Of these 3 happened in 29 the Lock Hospital and 241 in St. Mary's Hospital. As 2 of the former and 178 of the latter were those of non-parishioners, their deaths are excluded from consideration in this Report. Of the remaining 1,939 deaths 1,333 occurred in St. Mary's sub-district and 556 in St. John's. The 183 deaths in the Workhouse—83 males and 100 females—are included in the deaths in St. Mary's sub-district, as is also one of the deaths in the Lock Hospital. The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The following Table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, and the death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish, and in its two Sub-districts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population- Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1,000- St. John's 39,133 556 1 to 70 14.2 St. Mary's 74,496 1,383 1 to 54 18.6 Paddington 113,629 1,939 1 to 59 17.06 In calculating the death rate, no allowance has been made for the deaths unknown to me of parishioners in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in other hospitals, institutions, and places outside the parish; but the deaths in the 30 parish of persons who were not parishioners may be considered to some extent as a set-off against such deaths. In 1879 the death rate for London was 23.3 per 1,000. „ „ Edinburgh „ 19.7 „ „ „ Glasgow „ 21.7 „ „ „ Dublin „ 35.1 „ „ „ Englandand Wales „ 21.0 „ The evidence of improved sanitation throughout the Metropolis generally is seen in the reduction of the death rate which for some years has been going on—though not in equal proportions—in each one of the five groups of registration districts. The reduction has been most marked in the west and south districts. Deaths Registered in the London Districts. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879.

When considering the death-rates and comparing them with those of former years, it should be borne in mind that the year 1877 was exceptionally healthy 31 Notwithstanding, however, the greater mortality of 1878 and 1879, the death-rates from all causes during the quinquennium 1875-79 favourably compare with those of the previous quinquennial or decennial periods, as will be seen on referring to Table II. With a larger estimated population, the deaths of infants under one year and of children under five years of age were absolutely fewer in 1879 than in the years 1878, '76, or '75. Of the 2,912 children born in the parish 403 died during their first year of life, being 20.8 per cent. of the total deaths, and 13.8 per cent. of the registered births, or 208 per 1,000 deaths and 138 per 1,000 births. In the 20 largest English towns the corresponding rate was 151, and in London 148, per 1,000 registered births. The total deaths of children under five years of age were 677. This represents 35 per cent. of the entire mortality—that is to say, of every three deaths which happened in the parish during the past year, one was of a child under five years of age. This mortality, though greatly in excess of what it ought to have been, has in London during the last eight years, 1871-78, declined 7 per cent. A still greater reduction, amounting to 25 per cent., has, during the same period, been effected at the ages between five and ten years. Zymotic Diseases. From the seven principal zymotic diseases 243 32 deaths occurred, the death-rate being, as is shewn in Table IV., 2.1 per 1,000 of the population, the same as in 1877, whereas in London it was 33, Whilst the above figures represent all the deaths which actually occurred in the parish from those diseases, they do not include the cases of small-pox and of scarlet fever which were removed to the hospitals outside the parish. Small-pox. From small-pox three deaths occurred in the parish. In my last Annual Report some particulars are given of 25 cases which came under the notice of the Sanitary Department during the first eleven months of the year 1879. In December one other case was removed from St. John's. Of the 26 cases in all removed during the year—8 from St. Mary's and 18 from St. John's—6 were sent to the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital at Highgate, and 20 to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board. In London the deaths from small-pox were 2,544 in 1877, 1,416 in 1878, and 458 in 1879. Measles. Measles, which in London was more than usually fatal, caused 29 deaths in Paddington, 27 being of children under five years of age. The proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths was 15.0; in London it was 29.0. 33 Scarlet Fever. Scarlet fever was more fatal than usual and caused 67 deaths. 27 cases were sent to the hospitals; 2 to the London Fever Hospital, and 25 to the hospital at Stockwell. Of the 27 cases 17 were from St. Mary's and 10 from St John's sub-district. Diphtheria. Diphtheria was more fatal than usual and caused 26 deaths, being at the rate of 13.4 per 1,000 deaths; in London the proportion was 6.9. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough, which in London was more than usually fatal, caused 61 deaths, the proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths being 31.5. In London it was 35.0. Fever. The Registrar-General remarks that "evidence of the improved sanitary condition of London is afforded by the reduction of the mortality by fever, the death rate from which has been reduced from 9.2 in the thirty years 1841-70 to 3.9 in the nine years 1871-79; it was the cause of 1,099 deaths in 1879, a number considerably below the corrected average."In Paddington typhoid fever caused 16 3 34 deaths, being at the rate of 8.3 per 1,000 deaths; whereas in London it was 10.0. Diarrhœa. Owing to the low temperature during the summer of 1879 the deaths from diarrhœa were remarkably few, being in London little more than half of the number in the previous year. In Paddington diarrhœa caused 38 deaths, of which 28 were of children under 1 year of age, and were therefore cases of infantile diarrhœa. The proportion of deaths was l9.6 per 1,000 deaths. In London it was 22.4 per 1,000 of the total deaths in the year. Vaccination. Table VII., supplied by Mr. Dudman, furnishes the Vaccination statistics of the year. 13 children were certified to be insusceptible of vaccination. Those who are most conversant with the subject will be the first to admit that cases of insusceptibility of vaccination are extremely rare, much more so than is represented by the above numerals. Sanitary Work. Table VI. shows in part the Sanitary work done by the Inspectors during the parochial year, and affords convincing evidence, if such were needed, of the necessity for their services. With the increase 35 of houses and of population, those services are likely to be every year in greater request. The Canal Basin. Upon the condition of the Canal Basin much consideration has been bestowed by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. It at all times demands the attention of the Sanitary Inspector. The bottom of the Basin is covered with ooze irregularly distributed over it—the largest deposits being in the centre—consisting mostly of decomposed animal and vegetable substances, with more or less earthy matter, which have accidentally fallen from the wharves on either side of it and from the boats in the course of their being loaded and unloaded. Much of the excreta from persons living in the boats when in the Basin is thrown into it. Bilge water, the liquid from offensive cargoes, and surface water from the wharves, find their way into it. The ooze, soft mud or slime, nearly black in colour and amounting to several thousand tons, varies in thickness from a few inches to three feet. This was ascertained by me, with the help of Inspector Biorn, by means of measuring rods in 1878, and again within the last few days by Inspector Clifford. In front of some of the wharves, from carelessness in loading the boats, there are still larger 36 foul deposits. Such being the normal condition of the Basin itself, it necessarily follows that the water, however frequently changed, speedily becomes loaded with organic impurities. Ocular demonstration of this fact is unnecessary. Given a body of stagnant water, to which additions are daily made of putrescible materials, let it be subjected to every change of temperature, and let the mud at the bottom, consisting largely of decomposed organic matter, be frequently stirred— conditions similar to those presented by the water in the Canal Basin—and it may be safely predicated that such water is at all times foul, and capable of becoming offensive and injurious to health. The water in the Basin is stagnant, and stinks. With the warmer weather of the summer months its temperature is raised. Influenced also, it may be, by certain electrical conditions of the atmosphere, decomposition of the organic matter suspended in the water, or held in solution, goes on more rapidly; carbonic acid gas is given off, and sulphuretted hydrogen is liberally disengaged from the mud at the bottom, thus denoting the presence of animal matter. From the water supersaturated with these gases, bubbles may be seen rising and breaking upon its surface, to the annoyance, and not without danger to the health, of the neighbourhood. At this stage the water is black. 37 Dr. Sanderson, in his first annual report (1856), expresses the opinion that the Canal itself and the various noxious trades which are carried on on its banks are not only a public nuisance, but in an unmistakable manner shorten the lives and multiply the diseases of the surrounding inhabitants. In 1857, in consequence of the foul state of the Basin, the Vestry requested the Company to empty it and to remove the mud by spade labour. This the Company declined to do, and contented themselves with hand-dredging during several of the winter months. The manner in which the work was done did not satisfy the Surveyor of the Vestry. In May, 1858, the Basin was emptied, and the Company determined to cleanse the bottom by spade, notwithstanding a protest from the Sanitary Committee pointing out the danger of such procedure during the summer months. Dr. Sanderson reported that, although the operation was continued during eight days, the excavation had not at the end of that period extended to so much as one-half of the whole area of the Basin; that during the last three days of May, when the weather was unusually hot, the emanations were most overpowering, and afforded convincing evidence of the inexpediency and probable danger of exposing the channel to the summer sun. In December of the same year, the Sanitary Committee requested the Company to 38 empty the Basin and to remove the mud by spade, as they had promised to do in the previous July. The Company replied that, owing to the deficiency of rain, the reservoir from which the Canal is principally supplied was nearly empty, and that "it would therefore be impossible to run off any portion of the water from the Paddington Basin until such supplies could be obtained as would restore the quantity so run off." The Committee decided not to press the matter further at that time. In 1859, owing to the deficiency of rain during the spring, the exhalations from the water in June were peculiarly fetid. The efforts of the Vestry to induce the Company to abate the nuisance having proved ineffectual, proceedings were instituted at the Police Court, Marylebone, which caused the Company to give immediate orders for the disinfection of the Basin. During five days large quantities of disinfecting fluid (McDougall's) were introduced. The result appeared to be satisfactory; but, whenever the mud of the channel was disturbed, the stench was reproduced in its former intensity. In 1869, after much pressure from the Vestry, the Company undertook to effectually cleanse the Basin. Accordingly, in February, about 4,000 tons of mud were removed, and shortly afterwards Dr. Sanderson reported that the channel was in a satisfactory condition, and that the state of the water was wholly 39 unobjectionable. In 1861, Dr. Sanderson reported that the satisfactory condition of the Basin at the close of the previous year had not continued, in consequence "principally of the carelessness of the workmen employed on the wharves." In 1862, notwithstanding that the water was run off in July, it was found necessary in August again to press upon the Company the expediency of repeating the operation, but without effect. In January, 1863, it was resolved by the Vestry, "That their Solicitor do prepare and serve on the Grand Junction Canal Company a notice that, inasmuch as they have failed to comply with the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee to cleanse the bed of the Basin during the cold weather, the Vestry will hold the Company responsible for the consequences that may ensue in the hot season by reason of such neglect." In July, 1863. the water again became offensive, and occasioned much sickness among the women and children inhabiting the barges. The Basin was emptied and refilled with beneficial effect. At a special meeting of the Sanitary Committee the Secretary of the Grand Junction Canal Company represented that they had to encounter serious difficulties in consequence of the Metropolitan Board of Works requiring them to give forty-eight hours notice before allowing the water to flow into the * 40 sewers. In consideration of this statement the Vestry Clerk was directed to write to the Metropolitan Board of Works, pointing out to them how important it was to the health of the parish that the Basin should be frequently emptied, and requesting them, with a view to facilitate this object, to allow the Grand Junction Canal Company to run off their water through the sewers under their control at a shorter notice than forty-eight hours. To this request the Board declined to accede in consideration "of the necessity of making effectual and timely arrangements for the protection of the lives of the men working in the main sewers." In May, 1864, the Company, after much pressure on the part of Dr. Sanderson, cleansed the whole of the Basin to his entire satisfaction. The mud removed on this occasion amounted to several thousand tons. In 1865, Dr. Sanderson stated at a conference with the Directors of the Canal Company that in the opinion of the Vestry the nuisance was owing to three causes, viz.:— 1. To the stagnancy of the water. 2. To the carelessness of the wharfingers and bargemen, either in allowing soakage from the wharves, or in spilling offensive matter while loading their barges. 3. To the constant discharge from the barges into 41 the Basin of bilge water, night soil, and other descriptions of filth. Dr. Sanderson added that in the opinion of the Vestry these evils could only be remedied by the adoption of the following measures—(1) To renew the water every year at least three times during the summer months; (2) To make and enforce on all persons carrying on trade in manure or other offensive matters, and on all bargemen, such regulations as regards the construction of their barges and landing places as are necessary to prevent the spilling or soakage above referred to, and to prohibit the discharge of soil, bilge water, or other offensive liquids into the Basin. Dr. Sanderson further expressed a decided opinion that the changing of the water was in every respect preferable to the employment of any means of disinfection. In May, however, ten tons of chalk-lime were introduced into the water and scattered over its surface. The supply of water did not permit the Basin to be emptied before June, when it was found that the depth of the mud did not exceed a few inches in any part except in the neighbourhood of the bridge, The improvement in the health of the surrounding inhabitants, and particularly of the families of the bargemen, consequent on the removal of the water, was marked. In the summer of 1866 it was necessary that the Basin should be emptied. This was 42 done, and large quantities of foul deposit were found opposite the manure wharves, as well as at the east end of the Basin. Of this only a small quantity was removed. Dr. Hardwicke in his first annual report stated that the basin was emptied and tolerably well cleansed in July, 1867, and again less perfectly so at Christmas. In 1868 Dr. Hardwicke, with the sanction of the Vestry, addressed a letter to the Grand Junction Canal Company, in which, after refering to the insanitary condition of the Canal Basin; to the requirement by the Metropolitan Board of Works of forty-eight hours notice before allowing the water to be run off; to the making and enforcement of bye-laws, having for their object the prevention of the fouling of the basin by those employed thereon; to the absence of water-closet accommodation for such persons, as well as for those living in the barges; and to the need of cleansing the basin once or twice a year— matters and measures which had been previously urged by Dr. Sanderson—he recommended the appointment of an efficient waterbailiff to check those malpractices with regard to loading, &c., which have been the cause of nearly all the mischief. Dr. Hardwicke further recommended that, whenever it should become necessarv to cleanse the basin, a sufficient number of barges should be allowed to sink in it whilst the water 43 was being run off; that then the barges should be filled with the deposit, and afterwards floated and moved out of the parish as soon as the water was again let into the basin. In 1871 the basin was emptied, but none of the mud was taken away. In 1872 the water was run off, and part of the deposit removed. The measurements made by Inspector Clifford in the month of May of that year, and reported by Dr. Hardwicke, showed a deposit of mud varying in depth from two inches to five feet. Notices were served by the Sanitary Department upon the wharfingers and the Canal Company to cleanse the Basin. The wharfingers did their part; not so the Company. A summons was therefore taken out in the Marylebone Police Court, but proceedings were subsequently suspended, as the Company agreed to do all that was in the meantime necessary, and to prevent the recurrence of any nuisance. Dr. Hardwicke reported that the appointment of a water-bailiff by the Company had proved a complete failure, inasmuch as that officer had never attempted to enforce the bye-laws of the Local Act, and recommended that a special officer for that purpose should be employed by the Vestry. In April, 1873, the water was run off, but much of the mud was left untouched. A notice was therefore served upon the Company, under the Nuisance Removal Act. This proving ineffectual, a summons was taken out. 44 The case was argued at great length before Mr. D'Eyncourt, and resulted in a conviction against the Company. Upon Counsel giving notice of appeal to a higher court, the magistrate reconsidered his decision, and, after a few days, the Vestry Solicitor received a communication from Mr. D'Eyncourt to the effect that he could not sustain the order to convict the Company under the Nuisances Removal Act, inasmuch as he believed that Act did not contemplate dealing with a canal company, and that in future the Vestry should proceed by way of indictment whenever any actual nuisance arose. Dr. Hardwicke reported that in 1874 the water was not changed at "Whitsuntide, an it usually is; and that the Company had, during the winter, removed by dredging a considerable quantity of mud. In his last annual report (1874-75) Dr. Hardwicke remarks that during the whole period of bis official career, as well as during that of his predecessor, Dr. Sanderson, every attempt to improve the condition of the Canal Basin had failed, that the Company whilst expressing itself willing to take any steps that might be suggested contented itself with occasionally changing the water and partially removing the mud, but had never adopted any effectual method of regulating the noxious trades prosecuted on its banks. Dr. Hardwicke concludes 45 his remarks with the reiteration of the various suggestions that had been previously made for the improvement of the Canal Basin, viz.:—The provision of a concrete bottom, frequent change of water, its conversion into a running stream, thorough cleansing of the basin during the winter months, and the use of dredgers throughout the year, and adds that it would be quite feasible to buy the ground for building purposes, and to remove the noxious businesses further into the country. In my first annual report (1875) I expressed the opinion that the Canal Basin must remain a nuisance so long as the offensive trades carried on upon its banks are permitted, and its bed is left in its present state; that all attempts at disinfecting the basin would be nugatory; that if the mud were removed, a hard impermeable bottom provided, and the water changed as often as the necessity arose, the main conditions would be secured for bringing about a better state of matters; and that the Vestry could take care that the sewers were not choked with mud, and oblige the Canal Company in turn to compel their tenants to carry on their business with some regard to the public health. In June, 1876, on my representing to the Sanitary Committee the offensive condition of the water in the Canal Basin, the Vestry Clerk was instructed to write to the Grand Junction Canal Company requiring them to change the water 46 and to remove the mud, taking care to render the operation as inoffensive as possible. In the following month I reported to the Sanitary Committee that the Canal Basin had recently been twice emptied, and that of the deposit, which was found to be much less than might have been anticipated from the very offensive state of the water, none had been removed. In June, 1878, I informed the Sanitary Committee that on Whit-Monday of that year the water had been run off, that the bottom of the basin was covered with mud, varying in depth from one to three feet, and added that emptying and refilling the basin did not meet the necessities of the case ; that so long as the deposit remained the water must become foul, and, in a short time, being charged with noxious gases, prove injurious to health, and that therefore the mud should be removed. In July, 1878, I informed the Committee that the Basin had been again emptied, and that none of the deposit had been removed. I suggested that upon the return of cold weather the Vestry should insist on this being done. In December, 1878, I reminded the Committee of the above suggestion, and pointed out that it was insufficient to abate the nuisance, and that its recurrence should be prevented. Thereupon the Sanitary Committee instructed the Vestry Clerk to write to the Company pressing them to have the water run off, 47 and the bed properly cleansed whilst the weather was cold. To this the Company, in their letter of the 14th January, 1879, replied that it would be useless to run off the water at that season of the year, and that a hand dredger had been for some time past employed in cleansing the Basin. Thus the efforts of the Committee to have the Basin properly cleansed at that time were unsuccessful. In 1879 the Canal Basin was emptied three times. None of the deposit was removed. In November, 1879, the Sanitary Committee, at my suggestion, instructed the Vestry Clerk to write to the Company impressing upon them the desirableness of their employing additional dredging machines in the Canal Basin, and suggesting that the same should be kept constantly in action during the winter months. To this the Company replied that they had one dredger at work in the Paddington Basin and had arranged to put on another. The Company also expressed the hope that instructions would be given to the parties in charge of the parish wharves to see that the boats were properly loaded. I regret to add that during the past winter I have seldom seen or heard of more than one dredger at work; that so far from giving effect to the wishes of the Vestry to cleanse the Basin by getting rid of the 48 mud, there has been on the part of the Company only the semblance of compliance, and that consequently the bottom of the Canal Basin and the water in it are in as fetid a condition to-day as they ever were. I have purposely refrained from making any suggestions as to the mode in which the occupiers of the wharves should carry on their business. To my mind the reasons are cogent for declining to lay down rules professedly complete, and conformity to which might be held to absolve the parties concerned from blame. The nuisance is not imaginary, it is real, and its abatement should be not less so. The remedies are obvious. The duties neither of the owners nor of the occupants of the wharves are obscure. The Canal Company knows what the Vestry expects it to do, and can command its own counsellors. It cannot be contended that the Company has done all that it might have done. Had a sufficient number of dredging machines been employed during past winters, the bottom of the basin would have presented a very different appearance. The reports of my predecessors, Dr. Burdon Sanderson and Dr. Hardwicke, record similar conditions, similar suggestions, and similar abortive endeavours to effect any permanent improvement of the Canal Basin. 49 Whilst it is easy to infer from the preceding narrative what has been the condition of the Canal Basin at any time during the past twenty-five years, it is impossible to state with accuracy how much illness it has produced, and to what extent it has affected the death rate of the parish. In conducting such an enquiry one is confronted at the outset with the questions, how much of the evil is ascribable to the Canal itself, and how much to the trades carried on upon its banks, or to other causes ? That the foul state of the water produces headache, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, and sore throat amongst those employed in the basin is proved by the cessation of such symptoms upon changing the water, and by their return after putrefactive fermentation of the vegetable and animal matter in a fresh supply of water is again set up and allowed to do its work for a time. That there are poisonous gases—carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen— escaping from the water in large quantities during the summer months is shown by chemical analysis; that there are other aeriform products, not well ascertained, evolved in the processes of spontaneous decomposition of organic and mineral substances is more than probable; and that these tend to contaminate the air and render it more or less noxious to animal life, must be admitted, if it be true that atmospheric impurity is an abounding source of 4 50 disease. Besides the direct effects already enumerated of these known and unknown vapours which reach the circulation through the lungs, the stomach, and the skin, it is believed that, by depressing vital energy, they act still more injuriously and more extensively as the pre-disposing cause of some diseases, and in imparting a fatal tendency to others. With the facts now stated successive Sanitary Committees have long been familiar, as may be inferred from the numerous resolutions based upon them which have, from time to time, been sent up to the Vestry for its approval. It is for the Vestry, in the interests of public health, to determine how long it will allow the Canal Basin to remain an open sewer, as, at times, it may be not inaptly described. Canal Boats Act, 1877. This Act which provides for the registration and regulation of Canal boats used as dwellings came into operation on the 1st January, 1878; and the Regulations of the Local Government Board, which are complementary to the Act, on the 30th June of the same year. The objects of the Act are sanitary and educational. With the latter, Sanitary authorities have 51 little to do, the School Board being charged with its accomplishment. The Act and Regulations prescribe that after the 1st January, 1879, a canal boat shall not be used as a dwelling unless it is registered. The conditions of registration relate to the number, age, and sex of the persons who may be allowed to dwell in a boat, having regard to cubic space, ventilation, provision for the separation of the sexes, and convenience of accommodation afforded by each boat. In pursuance of its statutory powers, the Local Government Board constituted the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington, the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, and the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, the three Registration authorities in the Metropolis;—Paddington in respect both of the Grand Junction Canal and the Regent's Canal, Limehouse in respect of the Regent's Canal, and Rotherhithe in respect of the Grand Surrey Canal. At the date of this report 151 boats have been registered in London. Of these 2 were registered at Rotherhithe, 149* at Paddington, and none at Limehouse. For the efficient working of the Act some alterations in it will be necessary. These will be considered in a future report. i * Since writing the above 8 more boats have been registered in this parish. 52 Water. Paddington is supplied with water obtained from the Thames by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies. During the year 1879 the average daily supply of water to the inhabitants of London by the eight metropolitan companies was 134 millions of gallons. Whilst the quantity was greatly in excess of what is required, the quality of the river water was frequently very objectionable. The waters of the Thames and the Lea, even after efficient filtration by the various companies, were only in some measure fit for dietetic purposes during the months of April, November, and December. Only once since 1868 has the Thames water been so much polluted by organic matters as it was in the year 1879. The Thames was often in high flood even in summer, and much filthy matter from sewers, cesspools, and cultivated fields was swept into the river. No practicable amount of storage could have prevented the supply of flood water to London during the past two years. The Lea water maintained its superiority over that taken from the Thames, but was quite unfit for dietetic use during seven months of the year. Of the deep-well waters, that supplied by the Colne Valley Company was the best; of the Lea water, that sent out by the New River Company was the best, and of that taken from the Thames, the best average supplies were furnished 53 by the Lambeth and Chelsea Companies. The quality of the water drawn from deep-wells in the chalk by the Kent and Colne Valley Companies and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health was uniformly excellent for dietetic purposes throughout the year. The preceding remarks, together with the annexed tables, respecting the condition of the Metropolitan waters, are taken from Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General. 1 have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health.

Paddington. SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE INSPECTOR OF PUBLIC LIGHTING UPON THE SUBJECT OF THE AVERAGE METER SYSTEM. to the VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Public Lighting Department, June 18th, 1880. Gentlemen, I have to submit the Sixth Annual Report ending Lady-day, 1880, as to the working of this department. Satisfactory results are still obtained from the Meter System. Since September last the whole of the repairs and glazing of the lanterns (formerly executed by contract) have been done by men in the employ of the Vestry; during that period, viz., six months, three lampposts have been knocked down, twelve columns broken, ten head-irons, and ten lanterns damaged. In nine cases the parties causing such damage have been discovered and the expenses paid by them. The lamp services throughout the Parish are now in a most efficient state. The number of notices sent to the Gas Company during the year for the rectification of stoppages being 124. The accompanying tables will show the reported number of defects in the Metered and Scale Lamps during the twelve months. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WESTON, Inspector of Public Lighting for the Parish of Pad. ding ton. 5 66 METERED LAMPS. Quarter ending. Knocked down and out of Lighting.

ANNUAL REPORT of the SUPERINTENDENT of WORKS DEPARTMENT. to the VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON. Works Department, 18th June, 1880. Gentlemen, I beg to submit the annual report relative to this department, comprising Dusting, Slopping, Watering, and Carting Materials. It is now four years since the Vestry commenced to do its own dusting, and during the last two years the additional works of slopping, watering, and carting have also been carried out by the Parish, the results demonstrating in a very marked manner that under existing arrangements far greater efficiency has been attained than was the case when the several works were performed by contractors. Dusting.—Owing to the continuous wet weather last year the brickmakers were unable to manufacture their usual quantity of bricks, consequently a very large supply of ashes and breeze remained on their hands and available for this season's make, 70 therefore the demand during the past winter months has been rather limited, causing a large accumulation to be deposited on the land at Alperton. Had the Vestry been unable to avail themselves of this outlet it is highly probable they would have been compelled to pay for the removal of the material. During the year 3441 horses have been engaged in this work, being an average of 11.50 per day, the number of loads collected 17,245, being an average of 57.67 loads per working day, or 5.11 loads per horse, per day. From the before mentioned quantity 1089 loads of hard core has been picked out and carted away. 13,7911 chaldrons of ashes and 8,979½ chaldrons of breeze have been abstracted and sent away in 705 boats and 3,795 carts. The maximum price being 5s. and the minimum 2s. per chaldron. The quantity of soft core separated from the rough dust has been l,583¾ tons. This has been removed away into the country by 66 boats. The expenses attending the disposal of this very offensive material will undoubtedly increase year by year, owing to the great difficulty farmers experience in letting it remain on their land, and it is worth taking into serious consideration whether it would not be more 71 advantageous to construct suitable furnaces for burning this refuse together with other combustible materials, as is now done in several large towns in England, and on the Continent. The outlay to erect furnaces would soon be repaid. It is now incurring an expenditure of 2s. 4d. per ton, or something like £190 per annum before the Vestry are free from this obnoxious material, and it must be borne in mind that the present contract to receive it, is made, subject to the contractor having his tender for the supply of gravel accepted. Considerable difficulty was experienced in the winter months owing to the severe frost entirely blocking the canal for twenty-four days. This necessitated the ashes, breeze, and slop being deposited on the wharves, thereby increasing the expense of labour. Slopping.—During the year 26,971 loads of road scrapings, slop, and water have been taken from the roads, the maximum number collected in one week being 1,588, and the minimum 219. The average per day has been 87.85 loads. During the same period off the Uxbridge Road has been collected 3,288 loads, or an average of 62 loads per week; off Westbourne Grove 309 loads, or an average of 5.83 loads per week. 72 The before-mentioned work has been executed by 5,620 horses and carts, being an average of 18.3 per day, or 4.79 loads per horse per day. The large quantity of 22,815¾ tons have been sent away by canal in 566 boats, and the remaining 4,155 loads have been shot elsewhere. The average cost, collecting, loading boats, haulage, tonnage, and all expenses, with the exception of sweeping, amounted to 5s. 2.8d. per load. Watering.—Owing to the past wet season, the water-vans were only out 108 days. This will give an average of 22.22 per day. Carting Materials, &c.—The total number of horses and carts, &c., engaged in this class of work during the year has been 2,785, or a daily average of 9.6, this being an increase on former years. Horses.—The horses, 55 in number, are all in good health and condition, the actual losses during the year being two only, viz.:— 1. An old grey gelding from rupture of the liver. The whole structure of that organ was in a highly advanced stage of disease. 1. A roan gelding, aged, from pulmonary 73 sumption of some time standing, the lungs being full of abscesses. At the close of the autumn, when the watering season ceases, less horses are required, and the custom is to weed out certain old and defective horses from the stud. This being considered the most practical and economical course to pursue, consequently nine were disposed of by public auction in October last. Fodder.-—Advertisements have been issued for the supply of fodder for the horses three times during the year. The average cost for keep and bedding has been 17s. 7*74d. per horse per week.

Wright and Clements had the contract, owing to their sending in such indifferent articles, and rendering it frequently necessary to 74 return them. During the latter part of their contract the fodder had to be obtained elsewhere, surcharging them with the difference in price. Carts.—During the year six slop carts and one four wheel van have been built at the works, also the necessary repairs to the wheels and carts have been executed by the Vestry's own staff. Harness.—All harness repairs and new sets, with the exception of collars and housings, have been made on the works. Farriers' and Smiths' Work.—During the year the following works have been executed at the depot, viz.:—The making of horse shoes, shoeing, repairs of sifting machine, iron work for new and repaired carts, with the exception of wheel tiring; also the general smith's work required for the Highway Department, including 500 pickaxes, lined' and steeled, and the sharpening of 9,162 pickaxes and 304 chisels. The following tables, &c., will furnish sundry details of the year's proceedings in this department:— Table A.—Account of expenditure and sales, &c., in connection with dusting, slopping, watering, and carting materials, including repairs and 75 maintenance of water meters, stand posts, and supply of water for road making and road watering purposes.

Vestry Hall, Harrow Road. Paddington. SANITARY REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1879. r BY JAMES STEVENSON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. - FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, A necrological survey of Paddington in the year 1879 discloses a higher death rate than has obtained in any year since 1875. Assuming for the moment the correctness of each year's estimate of the population, and not doubting the accuracy in point of numbers of the death returns, the unwelcome fact above stated is indisputable. An examination, however, of the tables appended, will show that the higher death rate is due to the greater mortality from diseases of the respiratory organs, which were unusually fatal; the result of an exceptionally cold winter. In the case of persons aged sixty years and upwards, the death rate during the winter months is for the most part a question of temperature, as it is mainly determined by it. It is moreover not improbable that an estimate formed in 1879, and based upon data supplied by the census of 1871, is incorrect. Whether this be so or not the next census will declare. It is certain that in estimating the population the method 4 pursued by the late Registrar General, that is to say, "by adding to the population as enumerated at the last census a tenth of the difference between that number and the number obtained at the previous census for each year that has elapsed since the last census, and a fortieth of that difference for each odd quarter," is incorrect. It assumes an arithmetical instead of a geometrical progression in the increase of population. Notwithstanding the trouble and expense involved in numbering the people, it would be well, having regard to the importance of obtaining accurate vital statistics, which are necessarily based upon the numbers of a living existent population, if the census were taken in England every five years, as it is on the continent. A knowledge of the movements and distribution of populations, the recognition of the rapid growth of new industrial centres, and of the enlargement of old ones, of the continual influx and efflux of persons to and from the larger towns, and of the permanent drain by emigration, more particularly in times like the present, is necessary in order to ascertain each year the actual as distinct from the natural increase of population, and to determine with accuracy birth rates and death rates, and the multiform questions arising out of them— questions to statesmen, and to all who are charged 5 with the health of the people, of the highest importance, and demanding their first consideration. During the registration year of 53 weeks ending 3rd January, 1880, 2,912 births and 2,119 deaths were registered in Paddington. In the annexed tables 1,939 of these deaths are dealt with, the remaining 180 being those of non-parishioners. The recorded natural increase of the population from the excess of births over deaths was therefore 973. Assuming, as in former years, a further increase from the immigration of persons from other parts of London and from the country, the population in the middle of last year may be estimated at 113,629, allowing 74,496 to St. Mary's, and 39,133 to St. John's sub-districts. Of the 2,912 births, comprising 1,477 male and 1,435 female children, 2,180 were registered in the sub-district of St. Mary's, and 732 in that of St. John's. The proportion of the sexes was 100 males to 97 females—in the metropolis it was 100 males to 98 females. In St. Mary's the proportion was 100 males to 96 females, and in St. John's 100 males to 97 females. The births were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter cf the year. The 6 ratio of the births to the entire population of the parish was 1 birth to every 39 inhabitants, or a birth rate of 256 per 1,000 of the population. In St. Mary's sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 to 34 persons living, or a birth rate of 29*3 per 1,000 inhabitants. In St. John's the ratio of births to the population was 1 to every 53 persons living, or a birth rate of 18-7. Some of the preceding particulars are shewn in the subjoined table:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Bate per 1,000. St. John's 39,133 732 1 to 53 18.7 St. Mary's 74,496 2,180 1 to 34 29.3 Paddington 113,629 2,912 1 to 39 25.6 The birth rate for London was 36.5 per 1,000. The long-continued commercial depression allowing of fewer marriages is a probable explanation in part of the lower birth rate throughout the parish,, and generally throughout England and Wales. The total deaths registered in Paddington were, as already stated, 2,119. Of these 3 happened in 7 the Lock Hospital and 2:41 in St. Mary's Hospital. As 2 of the former and 178 of the latter were those of non-parishioners, their deaths are excluded from consideration in this Report. • Of the remaining 1,939 deaths 1,383 occurred in St. Mary's sub-district and 556 in St. John's. The 183 deaths in the Workhouse—83 males and 100 females—are included in the deaths in St. Mary's sub-district, as is also one of the deaths in the Lock Hospital. The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third, quarter of the year. The following Table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, and the death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish, and in its two Sub-districts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population- Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. John's 39,133 556 1 to 70 14.2 St. Mary's 74,496 1,383 1 to 54 18.6 Paddington 113,629 1,939 1 to 59 17.06 In calculating the death rate, no allowance has been made for the deaths unknown to me of parishioners in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and in other hospitals, institutions, and places outside the parish; but the deaths in the 8 parish of persons who were not parishioners may be considered to some extent as a set-off against such deaths. In 1879 the death rate for London was 23.3 per 1,000. „ „ Edinburgh „ 19.7 „ „ „ Glasgow „ 21.7 „ „ „ Dublin „ 35.1 „ „ „ England and Wales „ 21.0 „ The evidence of improved sanitation throughout the Metropolis generally is seen in the reduction of the death rate which for some years has been going on—though not in equal proportions—in each one of the five groups of registration districts. The reduction has been most marked in the west and south districts. Deaths Registered in the London Districts. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879. West Districts 22.2 21.0 19.2 21.6 21.1 North „ 22.3 21.4 21.8 22.3 22.0 South „ 24.0 22.1 21.4 24.2 23.3 East „ 25.6 24.0 24.5 25.0 25.7 Central „ 26.1 24.1 24.1 25.0 26.0 Deaths and Death-rates. When considering the death-rates and comparing them with those of former years, it should be borne in mind that the year 1877 was exceptionally healthy. 9 Notwithstanding, however, the greater mortality of 1878 and 1879, the death-rates from all causes during the quinquennium 1875-79 favourably compare with those of the previous quinquennial or decennial periods, as will be seen on referring to Table II. With a larger estimated population, the deaths of infants under one year and of children under five years of age were absolutely fewer in 1879 than in the years 1878, '76, or '75. Of the 2,912 children born in the parish 403 died during their first year of life, being 208 per cent. of the total deaths, and 13.8 per cent. of the registered births, or 208 per 1,000 deaths and 138 per 1,000 births. In the 20 largest English towns the corresponding rate was 151, and in London 148, per 1,000 registered births. The total deaths of children under five years of age were 677. This represents 35 per cent. of the entire mortality—that is to say, of every three deaths which happened in the parish during the past year, one was of a child under five years of age. This mortality, though greatly in excess of what it ought to have been, has in London during the last eight years, 1871-78, declined 7 per cent. A still greater reduction, amounting to 25 per cent., has, during the same period, been effected at the ages between five and ten years. Zymotic Diseases. From the seven principal zymotic diseases 243 10 deaths occurred, the death-rate being, as is shewn in Table IV., 2.1 per 1,000 of the population, the same as in 1877, whereas in London it was 3.3, Whilst the above figures represent all the deaths which actually occurred in the parish from those diseases, they do not include the cases of small-pox and of scarlet fever which were removed to the hospitals outside the parish. Small-pox. From small-pox three deaths occurred in the parish. In my last Annual Report some particulars are given of 25 cases which came under the notice of the Sanitary Department during the first eleven months of the year 1879. In December one other case was removed from St. John's. Of the 26 cases in all removed during the year—8 from St. Mary's and 18 from St. John's—6 were sent to the Smallpox and Vaccination Hospital at Highgate, and 20 to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylum Board. In London the deaths from small-pox were 2,544 in 1877, 1,416 in 1878, and 458 in 1879. Measles. Measles, which in London was more than usually fatal, caused 29 deaths in Paddington, 27 being of children under five years of age. The proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths was 15.0; in London it was 29.0. 11 Scarlet Fever. Scarlet fever was more fatal than usual and caused 67 deaths. 27 cases were sent to the hospitals; 2 to the London Fever Hospital, and 25 to the hospital at Stockwell. Of the 27 cases 17 were from St. Mary's and 10 from St John's sub-district. Diphtheria. Diphtheria was more fatal than usual and caused 26 deaths, being at the rate of 13.4 per 1,000 deaths; in London the proportion was 6.9. Whooping Cough. Whooping cough, which in London was more than usually fatal, caused 61 deaths, the proportion of deaths to every 1,000 deaths being 31.5. In London it was 35.0. Fever. The Registrar-General remarks that "evidence of the improved sanitary condition of London is afforded by the reduction of the mortality by fever, the death rate from which has been reduced from 9.2 in the thirty years 1841-70 to 3.9 in the nine years 1871-79; it was the cause of 1,099 deaths in 1879, a number considerably below the corrected average." In Paddington typhoid fever caused 16 12 deaths, being at the rate of 8.3 per 1,000 deaths; whereas in London it was 10.0. Diarrhœa. Owing to the low temperature during the summer of 1879 the deaths from diarrhœa were remarkably few, being in London little more than half of the number in the previous year. In Paddington diarrhœa caused 38 deaths, of which 28 were of children under 1 year of age, and were therefore cases of infantile diarrhoea. The proportion of deaths was 19.6 per 1,000 deaths. In London it was 22.4 per 1,000 of the total deaths in the year. Vaccination. Table VII., supplied by Mr. Dudman, furnishes the Vaccination statistics of the year. 13 children were certified to be insusceptible of vaccination. Those who are most conversant with the subject will be the first to admit that cases of insusceptibility of vaccination are extremely rare, much more so than is represented by the above numerals. Sanitary Work. Table VI. shows in part the Sanitary work done by the Inspectors during the parochial year, and affords convincing evidence, if such were needed, of the necessity for their services. With the increase 13 of houses and of population, those services are likely to be every year in greater request. The Canal Basin. Upon the condition of the Canal Basin much consideration has been bestowed by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. It at all times demands the attention of the Sanitary Inspector. The bottom of the Basin is covered with ooze irregularly distributed over it—the largest deposits being in the centre—consisting mostly of decomposed animal and vegetable substances, with more or less earthy matter, which have accidentally fallen from the wharves on either side of it and from the boats in the course of their being loaded and unloaded. Much of the excreta from persons living in the boats when in the Basin is thrown into it. Bilge water, the liquid from offensive cargoes, and surface water from the wharves, find their way into it. The ooze, soft mud or slime, nearly black in colour and amounting to several thousand tons, varies in thickness from a few inches to three feet. This was ascertained by me, with the help of Inspector Biorn, by means of measuring rods in 1878, and again within the last few days by Inspector Clifford. In front of some of the wharves, from carelessness in loading the boats, there are still larger 14 foul deposits. Such being the normal condition of the Basin itself, it necessarily follows that the water, however frequently changed, speedily becomes loaded with organic impurities. Ocular demonstration of this fact is unnecessary. Given a body of stagnant water, to which additions are daily made of putrescible materials, let it be subjected to every change of temperature, and let the mud at the bottom, consisting largely of decomposed organic matter, be frequently stirred— conditions similar to those presented by the water in the Canal Basin—and it may be safely predicated that such water is at all times foul, and capable of becoming offensive and injurious to health. The water in the Basin is stagnant, and stinks. With the warmer weather of the summer months its temperature is raised. Influenced also, it may be, by certain electrical conditions of the atmosphere, decomposition of the organic matter suspended in the water, or held in solution, goes on more rapidly; carbonic acid gas is given off, and sulphuretted hydrogen is liberally disengaged from the mud at the bottom, thus denoting the presence of animal matter. From the water supersaturated with these gases, bubbles may be seen rising and breaking upon its surface, to the annoyance, and not without danger to the health, of the neighbourhood. At this stage the water is black. 15 Dr. Sanderson, in his first annual report (1856), expresses the opinion that the Canal itself and the various noxious trades which are carried on on its banks are not only a public nuisance, but in an unmistakable manner shorten the lives and multiply the diseases of the surrounding inhabitants. In 1857, in consequence of the foul state of the Basin, the Vestry requested the Company to empty it and to remove the mud by spade labour. This the Company declined to do, and contented themselves with hand-dredging during several of the winter months. The manner in which the work was done did not satisfy the Surveyor of the Vestry. In May, 1858, the Basin was emptied, and the Company determined to cleanse the bottom by spade, notwithstanding a protest from the Sanitary Committee pointing out the danger of such procedure during the summer months. Dr. Sanderson reported that, although the operation was continued during eight days, the excavation had not at the end of that period extended to so much as one-half of the whole area of the Basin; that during the last three days of May, when the weather was unusually hot, the emanations were most overpowering, and afforded convincing evidence of the inexpediency and probable danger of exposing the channel to the summer sun. In December of the same year, the Sanitary Committee requested the Company to 16 empty the Basin and to remove the mud by spade, as they had promised to do in the previous July. The Company replied that, owing to the deficiency of rain, the reservoir from which the Canal is principally supplied was nearly empty, and that "it would therefore be impossible to run off any portion of the water from the Paddington Basin until such supplies could be obtained as would restore the quantity so run off." The Committee decided not to press the matter further at that time. In 1859, owing to the deficiency of rain during the spring, the exhalations from the water in June were peculiarly fetid. The efforts of the Vestry to induce the Company to abate the nuisance having proved ineffectual, proceedings were instituted at the Police Court, Marylebone, which caused the Company to give immediate orders for the disinfection of the Basin. During five days large quantities of disinfecting fluid (McDougall's) were introduced. The result appeared to be satisfactory; but, whenever the mud of the channel was disturbed, the stench was reproduced in its former intensity. In 1860, after much pressure from the Vestry, the Company undertook to effectually cleanse the Basin. Accordingly, in February, about 4,000 tons of mud were removed, and shortly afterwards Dr. Sanderson reported that the channel was in a satisfactory condition, and that the state of the water was wholly 17 unobjectionable. In 1861, Dr. Sanderson reported that the satisfactory condition of the Basin at the close of the previous year had not continued, in consequence " principally of the carelessness of the workmen employed on the wharves." In 1862, notwithstanding that the water was run off in July, it was found necessary in August again to press upon the Company the expediency of repeating the operation, but without effect. In January, 1863, it was resolved by the Vestry, "That their Solicitor do prepare and serve on the Grand Junction Canal Company a notice that, inasmuch as they have failed to comply with the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee to cleanse the bed of the Basin during the cold weather, the Vestry will hold the Company responsible for the consequences that may ensue in the hot season by reason of such neglect." In July, 1863. the water again became offensive, and occasioned much sickness among the women and children inhabiting the barges. The Basin was emptied and refilled with beneficial effect. At a special meeting of the Sanitary Committee the Secretary of the Grand Junction Canal Company represented that they had to encounter serious difficulties in consequence of the Metropolitan Board of Works requiring them to give forty-eight hours notice before allowing the water to flow into the 2 18 sewers. In consideration of this statement the Vestry Clerk was directed to write to the Metropolitan Board of Works, pointing out to them how important it was to the health of the parish that the Basin should be frequently emptied, and requesting them, with a view to facilitate this object, to allow the Grand Junction Canal Company to run off their water through the sewers under their control at a shorter notice than forty-eight hours. To this request the Board declined to accede in consideration "of the necessity of making effectual and timely arrangements for the protection of the lives of the men working in the main sewers." In May, 1864, the Company, after much pressure on the part of Dr. Sanderson, cleansed the whole of the Basin to his entire satisfaction. The mud removed on this occasion amounted to several thousand tons. In 1865, Dr. Sanderson stated at a conference with the Directors of the Canal Company that in the opinion of the Vestry the nuisance was owing to three causes, viz.:— 1. To the stagnancy of the water. 2. To the carelessness of the wharfingers and bargemen, either in allowing soakage from the wharves, or in spilling offensive matter while loading their barges. 3. To the constant discharge from the barges into 19 the Basin of bilge water, night soil, and other descriptions of filth. Dr. Sanderson added that in the opinion of the Vestry these evils could only be remedied by the adoption of the following measures—(1) To renew the water every year at least three times during the summer months; (2) To make and enforce on all persons carrying on trade in manure or other offensive matters, and on all bargemen, such regulations as regards the construction of their barges and landing places as are necessary to prevent the spilling or soakage above referred to, and to prohibit the discharge of soil, bilge water, or other offensive liquids into the Basin. Dr. Sanderson further expressed a decided opinion that the changing of the water was in every respect preferable to the employment of any means of disinfection. In May, however, ten tons of chalk-lime were introduced into the water and scattered over its surface. The supply of water did not permit the Basin to be emptied before June, when it was found that the depth of the mud did not exceed a few inches in any part except in the neighbourhood of the bridge, The improvement in the health of the surrounding inhabitants, and particularly of the families of the bargemen, consequent on the removal of the water, was marked. In the summer of 1866 it was necessary that the Basin should be emptied. This was 20 done, and large quantities of foul deposit were found opposite the manure wharves, as well as at the east end of the Basin. Of this only a small quantitywas removed. Dr. Hardwicke in his first annual report stated that the basin was emptied and tolerably well cleansed in July, 1867, and again less perfectly so at Christmas. In 1868 Dr. Hardwicke, with the sanction of the Vestry, addressed a letter to the Grand Junction Canal Company, in which, after refering to the insanitary condition of the Canal Basin; to the requirement by the Metropolitan Board of Works of forty-eight hours notice before allowing the water to be run off; to the making and enforcement of bye-laws, having for their object the prevention of the fouling of the basin by those employed thereon; to the absence of water-closet accommodation for such persons, as well as for those living in the barges; and to the need of cleansing the basin once or twice a year—matters and measures which had been previously urged by Dr. Sanderson—he recommended the appointment of an efficient waterbailiff to check those malpractices with regard to loading, &c., which have been the cause of nearly all the mischief. Dr. Hardwicke further recommended that, whenever it should become necessary to cleanse the basin, a sufficient number of barges should be allowed to sink in it whilst the water 21 was being run off; that then the barges should be filled with the deposit, and afterwards floated and moved out of the parish as soon as the water was again let into the basin. In 1871 the basin was emptied, but none of the mud was taken away. In 1872 the water was run off, and part of the deposit removed. The measurements made by Inspector Clifford in the month of May of that year, and reported by Dr. Hardwicke, showed a deposit of mud varying in depth from two inches to five feet. Notices were served by the Sanitary Department upon the wharfingers and the Canal Company to cleanse the Basin. The wharfingers did their part; not so the Company. A summons was therefore taken out in the Marylebone Police Court, but proceedings were subsequently suspended, as the Company agreed to do all that was in the meantime necessary, and to prevent the recurrence of any nuisance. Dr. Hardwicke reported that the appointment of a water-bailiff by the Company had proved a complete failure, inasmuch as that officer had never attempted to enforce the bye-laws of the Local Act, and recommended that a special officer for that purpose should be employed by the Vestry. In April, 1873, the water was run off, but much of the mud was left untouched. A notice was therefore served upon the Company, under the Nuisance Removal Act. This proving ineffectual, a summons was taken out. 22 The case was argued at great length before Mr. D'Eyncourt, and resulted in a conviction against the Company. Upon Counsel giving notice of appeal to a higher court, the magistrate reconsidered his decision, and, after a few days, the Vestry Solicitor received a communication from Mr. D'Eyncourt to the effect that he could not sustain the order to convict the Company under the Nuisances Removal Act, inasmuch as he believed that Act did not contemplate dealing with a canal company, and that in future the Vestry should proceed by way of indictment whenever any actual nuisance arose Dr. Hardwicke reported that in 1874 the water was not changed at Whitsuntide, as it usually is; and that the Company had, during the winter, removed by dredging a considerable quantity of mud. In his last annual report (1874-75) Dr. Hardwicke remarks that during the whole period of his official career, as well as during that of his predecessor, Dr. Sanderson, every attempt to improve the condition of the Canal Basin had failed, that the Company whilst expressing itself willing to take any steps that might be suggested contented itself with occasionally changing the water and partially removing the mud, but had never adopted any effectual method of regulating the noxious trades prosecuted on its banks. Dr. Hardwicke concludes 23 his remarks with the reiteration of the various suggestions that had been previously made for the improvement of the Canal Basin, viz.:—The provision of a concrete bottom, frequent change of water, its conversion into a running stream, thorough cleansing of the basin during the winter months, and the use of dredgers throughout the year, and adds that it would be quite feasible to buy the ground for building purposes, and to remove the noxious businesses further into the country. In my first annual report (1875) I expressed the opinion that the Canal Basin must remain a nuisance so long as the offensive trades carried on upon its banks are permitted, and its bed is left in its present state; that all attempts at disinfecting the basin would be nugatory; that if the mud were removed, a hard impermeable bottom provided, and the water changed as often as the necessity arose, the main conditions would be secured for bringing about a better state of matters; and that the Vestry could take care that the sewers were not choked with mud, and oblige the Canal Company in turn to compel their tenants to carry on their business with some regard to the public health. In June, 1876, on my representing to the Sanitary Committee the offensive condition of the water in the Canal Basin, the Vestry Clerk was instructed to write to the Grand Junction Canal Company requiring them to change the water 24 and to remove the mud, taking care to render the operation as inoffensive as possible. In the following month I reported to the Sanitary Committee that the Canal Basin had recently been twice emptied, and that of the deposit, which was found to be much less than might have been anticipated from the very offensive state of the water, none had been removed. In June, 1878, I informed the Sanitary Committee that on Whit-Monday of that year the water had been run off, that the bottom of the basin was covered with mud, varying in depth from one to three feet, and added that emptying and refilling the basin did not meet the necessities of the case; that so long as the deposit remained the water must become foul, and, in a short time, being charged with noxious gases, prove injurious to health, and that therefore the mud should be removed. In July, 1878, I informed the Committee that the Basin had been again emptied, and that none of the deposit had been removed. I suggested that upon the return of cold weather the Vestry should insist on this being done. In December, 1878, I reminded the Committee of the above suggestion, and pointed out that it was insufficient to abate the nuisance, and that its recurrence should be prevented. Thereupon the Sanitary Committee instructed the Vestry Clerk to write to the Company pressing them to have the water run off, 25 and the bed properly cleansed whilst the weather was cold. To this the Company, in their letter of the 14th January, 1879, replied that it would be useless to run off the water at that season of the year, and that a hand dredger had been for some time past employed cleansing the Basin. Thus the efforts of the Committee to have the Basin properly cleansed at that time were unsuccessful. In 1879 the Canal Basin was emptied three times. None of the deposit was removed. In November, 1879, the Sanitary Committee, at my suggestion, instructed the Vestry Clerk to write to the Company impressing upon them the desirableness of their employing additional dredging machines in the Canal Basin, and suggesting that the same should be kept constantly in action during ihe winter months. To this the Company replied that they had one dredger at work in the Paddington Basin and had arranged to put on another. The Company also expressed the hope that instructions would be given to the parties in charge of the parish wharves to see that the boats were properly loaded. I regret to add that during the past winter I have seldom seen or heard of more than one dredger at \ work; that so far from giving effect to the wishes of the Vestry to cleanse the Basin by getting rid of the 26 mud, there has been on the part of the Company only the semblance of compliance, and that consequently the bottom of the Canal Basin and the water in it are in as fetid a condition to-day as they ever were. I have purposely refrained from making any suggestions as to the mode in which the occupiers of the wharves should carry on their business. To my mind the reasons are cogent for declining to lay down rules professedly complete and conformity to which might be held to absolve the parties concerned from blame. The nuisance is not imaginary, it is real, and its abatement should be not less so. The remedies are obvious. The duties neither of the owners nor of the occupants of the wharves are obscure. The Canal Company knows what the Vestry expects it to do, and can command its own counsellors. It cannot be contended that the Company has done all that it might have done. Had a sufficient number of dredging machines been employed during past winters, the bottom of the basin would have presented a very different appearance. The reports of my predecessors, Dr. Burdon Sanderson and Dr. Hardwicke, record similar conditions, similar suggestions, and similar abortive endeavours to effect any permanent improvement of the Canal Basin. 27 Whilst it is easy to infer from the preceding narrative what has been the condition of the Canal Basin at any time during the past twenty-five years, it is impossible to state with accuracy how much illness it has produced, and to what extent it has affected the death rate of the parish. In conducting such an enquiry one is confronted at the outset with the questions, how much of the evil is ascribable to the Canal itself, and how much to the trades carried on upon its banks, or to other causes? That the foul state of the water produces headache, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, and sore throat amongst those employed in the basin is proved by the cessation of such symptoms upon changing the wrater, and by their return after putrefactive fermentation of the vegetable and animal matter in a fresh supply of water is again set up and allowed to do its work for a time. That there are poisonous gases—carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen— escaping from the water in large quantities during the summer months is shown by chemical analysis; that there are other aeriform products, not well ascertained, evolved in the processes of spontaneous decomposition of organic and mineral substances is more than probable; and that these tend to contaminate the air and render it more or less noxious to animal life, must be admitted, if it be true that atmospheric impurity is an abounding source of 4 28 disease. Besides the direct effects already enumerated of these known and unknown vapours which reach the circulation through the lungs, the stomach, and the skin, it is believed that, by depressing vital energy, they act still more injuriously and more extensively as the pre-disposing cause of some diseases, and in imparting a fatal tendency to others. With the facts now stated successive Sanitary Committees have long been familiar, as may be inferred from the numerous resolutions based upon them which have, from time to time, been sent up to the Vestry for its approval. It is for the Vestry, in the interests of public health, to determine how long it will allow the Canal Basin to remain an open sewer, as, at times, it may be not inaptly described. Canal Boats Act, 1877. This Act which provides for the registration and regulation of Canal boats used as dwellings came into operation on the 1st January, 1878; and the Regulations of the Local Government Board, which are complementary to the Act, on the 30th June of the same year. The objects of the Act are sanitary and educational. With the latter, Sanitary authorities have 29 little to do, the School Board being charged with its accomplishment. The Act and Regulations prescribe that after the 1st January, 1879, a canal boat shall not be used as a dwelling unless it is registered. The conditions of registration relate to the number, age, and sex of the persons who may be allowed to dwell in a boat, having regard to cubic space, ventilation, provision for the separation of the sexes, and convenience of accommodation afforded by each boat. In pursuance of its statutory powers, the Local Government Board constituted the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington, the Vestry of the Parish of Rotherhithe, and the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, the three Registration authorities in the Metropolis;—Paddington in respect both of the Grand Junction Canal and the Regent's Canal, Limehouse in respect of the Regent's Canal, and Rotherhithe in respect of the Grand Surrey Canal. At the date of this report 151 boats have been registered in London. Of these 2 were registered at Rotherhithe, 149* at Paddington, and none at Limehouse. For the efficient working of the Act some alterations in it will be necessary. These will be considered in a future report. * Since writing the above 8 more boats have been registered in this parish. 30 Water. Paddington is supplied with water obtained from the Thames by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies. During the year 1879 the average daily supply of water to the inhabitants of London by the eight metropolitan companies was 134 millions of gallons. Whilst the quantity was greatly in excess of what is required, the quality of the river water was frequently very objectionable. The waters of the Thames and the Lea, even after efficient filtration by the various companies, were only in some measure fit for dietetic purposes during the months of April, November, and December. Only once since 1868 has the Thames water been so much polluted by organic matters as it was in the year 1879. The Thames was often in high flood even in summer, and much filthy matter from sewers, cesspools, and cultivated fields was swept into the river. No practicable amount of storage could have prevented the supply of flood water to London during the past two years. The Lea water maintained its superiority over that taken from the Thames, but was quite unfit for dietetic use during seven months of the year. Of the deep-well waters, that supplied by the Colne Valley Company was the best; of the Lea water, that sent out by the New River Company was the best, and of that taken from the Thames, the best average supplies were furnished 31 by the Lambeth and Chelsea Companies. The quality of the water drawn from deep-wells in the chalk by the Kent and Colne Valley Companies and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health was uniformly excellent for dietetic purposes throughout the year. The preceding remarks, together with the annexed tables, respecting the condition of the Metropolitan waters, are taken from Dr. Frankland's Annual Report to the Registrar-General. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1880. 32 TABLE I.
