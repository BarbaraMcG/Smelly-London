ANNUAL REPORT OP THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1951 Public Health Department, 2, Shalston Villas, Surbiton. August, 1952. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am presenting my thirtieth Annual Report for Surbiton. From perusal of the vital statistics which follow there is a decrease of 140 in the population although the natural increase is 184; this is in spite of the erection of, or conversion of houses, giving 162 extra units of accommodation. The birth rate shows an increase from 12.55 to 12.65. There is however a decrease in the Infantile Mortality rate from 26.31 to 20.21 per 1,000 live births which compares favourably with that of England and Wales (29.6). Under the Industrial Court Award it was decided by the Local Authority that I should attend at the office for three notional half days a week. This, in my opinion, is totally inadequate for a town of this size and it is considerably less than I have been doing for the past fifteen years. Two Acts were introduced during the year namely the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951» and the Pet Animals Act, 1951.

This is accounted for by the ^ ^ihot more measles were notified than in any previous year. Both :r±et fever and dysentery show a considerable decrease. diphtheria continues to be non-existent in Surbiton, the last case currmg in 19^5. Acute poliomyelitis continues to show a decrease. 7.

Very useful work was carried out by this Committee. All cases requiring assistance are considered by the Committee both on notification and discharge from sanatoria. Applications for houses and better housing conditions which are sent to me by the Chest Specialist are investigated by me and sent to the Housing Committee for their consideration. It is essential that persons suffering from tuberculosis should have separate rooms. DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION. Children treated at clinics. Children treated by General Practitioners.

No facilities for treatment of scabies exist in the Borough but arrangements have been made with the Kingston Corporation for Surbiton cases to be treated at the Centre at Burton Road, Kingston on payment of the cost by the Surbiton Corporation. The charge agreed is 5/- and during 1951 five cases were treated. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. The water throughout the district is furnished by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a constant supply of excellent quality. I am supplied with monthly reports by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examination. PUBLIC CLEANSING. Refuse and Salvage Collection. The rate of the collection of refuse and salvage, except when Bank Holidays interfered with collection, was maintained at once in every seven days. Street Sweeping. The hand sweeping of streets was handicapped by the shortage of manpower. The mechanical street sweeper-collector was put into use and maintained the cleanliness of the carriageways in the Borough. Refuse Disposal. The house refuse collected south of the Kingston by Pass was again disposed of at the Council's controlled tip, while the experiment of tipping the remainder into wet gravel pits at Egham was continued. Cesspool Emptying. On request cesspools are emptied by the Council and others are done by private contract. Hogsmill Stream. One disturbing feature was the pollution of the Hogsmill Stream by Salmonellae paratyphi B. Several samples and precautions were taken and notice boards were erected informing the public that the water was unfit for bathing. SWIMMING BATHS AND POOLS. Publicly owned baths. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, Surbiton, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide with a depth of three to nine feet. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilization by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted accordingly. In addition three samples were taken by the Public Health Department for both chemical and bacteriological examination which proved to be satisfactory. Privately owned pools open to the public. Ace of Spades Swimming Pool, Kingston by Pass Road, is an open air pool 40 feet by 20 feet with a depth of 4 feet to 7 feet 6 inches- 12 The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilization by injection of chlorine and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Twelve samples were taken by the Department during 1951. MILK. One hundred and thirtyseven samples of milk were taken, full details of which are shown on page twentynine. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. It has not been necessary to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, although several cases have been brought to the notice of the Public Health Department.

On the instructions of the Council a warning letter was sent to the butcher responsible for the unsatisfactory sample. 1125 (informal) Tomato Ketchup. The label did not specify the ingredients of this article as is required by the Labelling of Food Order 1950. Having regard to the circular from the Ministry of Food on this subject dated October 1950, the matter was taken up with the Company concerned who agreed to withdraw from sale the small remaining stock. 1136 (formal) Pork Sausages. Contained 540 parts per million by weight of sulphur dioxide which is an added preservative. The maximum permissible limit for sulphur dioxide in sausages is 450 parts per million. On the instructions of the Council a warning letter was sent to the Company responsible for the unsatisfactory sample. 24. ICE CREAM. Promises have been registered by the Corporation under Section 14, Food 8c Drugs Act, 1938, as under For manufacture,storage and sale 18 For manufacture, storage and sale but manufacture to be limited to ice-lollies 15 For storage and sale, but not manufacture 83 During the year 161 visits were made to premises and vehicles and 135 samples of ice cream wore taken for laboratory examination for bacterial cleanliness, details being appended. The Public Health Laboratory Service advises that it is unwise to pay too much attention to the result of any one sample. Judgment should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that it would be reasonable to expect about 50 per cent. of samples throughout the year to fall into Grade I, 80 per cent into Grades 1 or 2, not more than 20 per cent into Grade 3, and none into Grade 4. Owing to the large number of manufacturers whose ice-cream was sold in the Borough during the year it was not possible to take a series of samples from each, but as the table shows, efforts were made to repeat unsatisfactory samples till improvement was effected or the supply discontinued. All retailers and manufacturers have been allotted a code number so that results can be published each year for comparison with previous years. Each retailer from whom a sample was taken was supplied with a copy of the laboratory report, and a Sanitary Inspector visited the premises and gave advice where reports were not up to the standard expected. Where manufacture took place outside the Borough (as was so frequently the case) copies of reports whether good or otherwise were also sent to the Sanitary Inspector for the district concerned for his information. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951, became operative on 1st March and for the first time laid down a minimum standard of composition for ice cream. Ordinary Ice-cream must now contain not less than 5% fat, 10% sugar and 7½% milk solids other than fat. There are special provisions for ice cream containing fruit or fruit pulp and for Kosher ice. In introducing the Order, the Minister of Food made it clear that he regards the standard as an interim one and he proposes progressively to improve the standard as supplies of ingredients become more plentiful. 25. Five samples were taken to see that this standard was * reached and all were found in order. LAB. REF. NO. DATE SAMPLE ! TAKEN RETAI LER WHETHER MANUFACTURED IN BOROUGH ' MANUFACT URER.

(i) At the end of the year there were thirty-one entries on the register as follows:- Distributors of milk residing in the Borough 14 Distributors of Milk residing outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 8 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 9 (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk)Regulations,1949. Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised" Milk) Regulations,1949 . Dealers' licences to sell designated milk were granted a3 follows:- Pasteurised milk 9 Pasteurised milk (supplementary) 6 Tuberculin tested milk 9 Tuberculin tested milk(supplementary) 6 Sterilised milk 8 Sterilised milk (supplementary) 7 (iii) 137 samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests :- Phosphatase Test Methylene Blue Test Turbidity Test T.B.Microscopical Test. T.B. Biological Test. Pasteurised 92 82 — - - G .1 .Pasteurised 2 2 - - — Ster ilised ~ 8 - T.T.Farm Bottled 4 - 10 11 T .T.Pasteurised 8 6 — - — Raw Milk 2 - 13 13 All samples passed the prescribed tests - an exceedingly good record. The Phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the Methylene Blue Test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality, the Turbidity Test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. tests are for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. DYSENTERY AND FOOD POISONING. A considerable amount of Sanitary Inspectors' time is now devoted to action for the control of these diseases, details of which are given in the Medical Officer of Health's report. When suspected cases are notified every effort is made to trace the source of the illness, and specimens from the patients a3 well as possibly infected foodstuffs are procured for examination in the Laboratory. The number of specimens collected and taken to the Laboratory 29. for bacteriological examination was as under Faeces Suspected food. 1950 1202 13 1951 694 2 FACTORIES AND BAKEHOUSES, The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 233 (192 mechanical, 40 non-mechanical and 1 works of building construction). The businesses carried on at the respective premises were as follows Bakehouses • 17 Laundries 10 Cleaners & Dyers 5 Tailors 4 Engineers (various) 34 Timber Yards 1 Manufacture and repair of batteries 2 Chemical manufacture and hairdressing sundries 1 Cellulose spraying and coach building 4 Stove enamelling and spray painting 1 Printers 11 Builders,Joiners and Plumbers 20 Boot repairers 15 Motor Engineers 20 Brickmaking 1 Fencing Contractors 1 Concrete Products 3 Machine Tools 2 Instrument making 4 Metal work 6 Fur glove makers 1 Cycle repairers 4 Radio and electrical engineers 7 Spectacle frame and lens making 4 Plastics 2 Dental laboratories 3 Paint manufacturers 1 Works of building construction * 1 Manufacture of breathing apparatus 1 Aircraft components 3 Blindmaking 1 Cardboard containers 2 Manufacture of rubber tyres,etc. 1 Accordion making 1 Cosmetics 2 Wireworks 2 Furniture making 1 Food packing 2 Pen manufacturers 2 Car breaking 1 Photography * 2 Dressmaking 2 Loom weaving and church vestments 1 Upholstery 4 Clothing repairs 2 30. Every possible help has been forthcoming from the Public Health Laboratory, Epsom, where specimens are examined, and this assistance is gratefully acknowledged. Moulded paper articles 1 Manufacture of hardware 1 Wax blending 1 Assembly and packing of electrical appliances 1 Boat repairs 1 Refrigeration equipment 1 Metal merchants 1 Sewage disposal works 1 Miscellaneous 10 Two hundred and forty-two visits were made to these premises, and works were carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Inadequate ventilation 1 factory Insufficient sanitary conveniences 3 factories Defective, dirty or inadequately lighted sanitary conveniences 20 factories Means of escape in case of fire not in order 2 factories Other offences 12 factories. Two certificates were issued •under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may be reasonably required in the circumstances of the case. There were 78 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Five visits were made but no contraventions found. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS. The parts of these Acts for which the Council is responsible relate to false trade descriptions of articles of food and to the marking of certain imported foodstuffs with an indication of the country of origin. There is a tendency for the requirements of these Acts and the Marking Orders made thereunder to be 'overlooked' by traders, and in an attempt to achieve compliance without undue friction some "notes for the guidance of traders" were prepared and handed to them by the inspectors when visiting. This has resulted in a considerable improvement in the position, though labels still seem to get misplaced, lost or forgotten, and frequent reminders are necessary. Bearing in mind that the Council only undertook the administration of these Acts in 1949, the position can be regarded as fairly satisfactory, and I feel sure that a continuing effort on our part will soon produce the desired result. 31. SHOPS ACT,1950. (a) Sunday Trading. A request was received from certain "back street" traders for the Council to make a Partial Exemption Order permitting the sale of bread, groceries etc. on Sunday mornings . After going through the proper formalities and hearing numerous objections the Council decided to make an Order known as The Surbiton (Alpha Road Area) (Sunday Hours of Opening) Order, 1952, which permits shops in the locality defined to sell bread and flour confectionery including rolls and fancy bread, groceries, and other provisions commonly sold in grocers shops on Sunday mornings not later than ten o'clock. (b) Hairdressers. An application was received from a number of hairdressers for the substitution of later evening closing hours in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of the Act. The reason given for the application was "with a view to alleviating the difficulties which will be occasioned to the hairdressing trade by the proposed cuts in the electricity supply". After inviting the observations of interested parties the Council decided not to make an Order amending closing hours in view of the divided views of the various hairdressers and organisations concerned. MOVEABLE DWELLINGS. Twenty-five licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted during the year. Twelve of the caravans are standing on the Riverhill Estate which has been leased to a local Sports Club where a colony of such dwellings is being developed on attractive lines. The remainder are stationed on odd sites throughout the Borough. All are in permanent use and in all probability would not exist at all but for the housing shortage. They are generally well maintained by the occupiers and have never been the subject of complaint by anyone. Those who live in them are well satisfied with life under such conditions in preference to living in "rooms", and there is no doubt that the modern caravan provides a very comfortable home for a small family. The policy of the Council is to grant Individual licences annually so that strict control is exercised. There is one site in the Borough on which some unlicensed caravans are parked which is receiving consideration. Many enquiries are received about camping sites, but the Prohibition Orders obtained by the Council under the Surrey County Council Acts have almost sterilised the country parts of' the Borough for use in this way. This is probably a good thing because I feel there are limits to the number of dwellings of this type which could be accommodated in a Borough such as this without causing trouble of some kind, particularly as control under town planning and public health legislation is not too effective. Most of the caravanists are actual or potential housing applicants and to open up more camping sites would undoubtedly attract people from other districts who would swell the waiting list for houses. 32. DUSTBINS. Twenty-seven dustbins were provided as a result of notices served. Four of the notices were statutory and the remainder informal. The service of a statutory notice under Section 75 of the Public Health Act,1936, requiring the provision of a new dustbin has become almost a major operation. The Council is empowered to serve on either the owner or the occupier and whichever is selected has a right of appeal. This ambiguity has led to Court actions in various parts of the country which have failed to clarify the position, and it remains for the Council after considering all relevant facts to decide which party shall be held responsible, bearing in mind that the chosen party may appeal to the Courts if dissatisfied with the decision. The Council had four such decisions to make during the year, and in each case called upon the occupier to provide the new bin. The decisions of the Council have only once been challenged when in 1948 an occupier appealed and the Magistrates ordered the owner to provide the bin. The Council's scheme for the sale of new dustbins has been continued on slightly modified lines, and has proved acceptable and useful. One hundred and sixteen new bins were sold during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS. The new Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act with its accompanying Regulations came into force on 1st November, 1951. A survey of the district showed very little activity in work coming within the scope * of this legislation and only two premises have been registered. DISINFECTION. (a). During the year disinfection was carried out at thirty-nine premises in which the following diseases occurred:- \ Anterior Poliomyelitis (or suspected) 8 Scarlet Fever 5 Smallpox contact 1 Tuberculosis 23 Meningococcal infection 1 Typhoid (suspected) 1 Disinfection was also carried out at nineteen other premises on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. 33.

DISINFESTATION. (a) Bed Bugs. Council Houses Other Houses. Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infested Disinfested 1 1 7 7 Methods employed for disinfestation Spraying with insecticide 7 Use of D.D.T. Powder 1 For the convenience of the public a stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to be much appreciated. (b) School Canteens. At the request of the County Council six school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent insect pests, the County Council paying the cost of the work. 34. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries continued its grant-aid of 50 per cent of the irrecoverable expenditure incurred by the Council in carrying out its functions. Grant aid is not available in respect of expenditure incurred on treatment at commercial and industrial premises, and the full cost of the work has therefore to be recovered from the occupiers or, in certain circumstances, the owners. Forty-seven business or industrial premises, schools etc., were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. It is the duty of occupiers of houses to keep their premises free from rats and mice, but the Council continued to carry out treatment of infestations at private dwellings without charge provided the occupiers took such steps as might from time to time be necessary and reasonably practicable for preventing their premises from becoming infested with rats and mice. This decision has considerably facilitated work at private houses. Under the charging scheme there were constant disputes as to liability and one 'difficult' occupier frequently held up treatment on a block of property for long periods. Now, immediately an infestation is found, treatment is able to proceed. 35 The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year.

BUILDING LICENCES. During the year 22 visits were made in connection with licences and suitable recommendations made to the Borough Engineer who is Licensing Officer. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT,1948. No action was necessary during the year under section 50 of the above-named Act. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 82 bodies were received into the Mortuary for post-mortem examination. CONCLUSION. This report covers an interesting year's work and it will be seen that there was activity in most branches of our varied duties, with much accomplished. The difficulties of landlords in maintaining their property in a good state of repair have become more pronounced and there was a noticeable 'hardening' of the position. It becomes increasingly difficult to administer the Acts which make it obligatory for owners to repair their houses when the financial problems involved are so manifest. The response of owners to requests for repairs has on the whole been good, and though there was often delay,every possible consideration was given and persuasive methods eventually prevailed. It was seldom necessary to resort to statutory action, and only in the case of four houses did the Council have to execute works in default. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H.J. ELDRIDGE, Senior Sanitary Inspector. 39. I have to thank the Chief Officers of the Corporation for their co-operation, also Mr. Eldridge and the staff of my Department for their help and assistance throughout the year. NEVILLE H. LINZEE. Medical Officer of Health. 40..
