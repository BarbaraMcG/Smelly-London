AC 4413(1) II MAL 27 Brough of Malden and Coombe Annual Report OF THE Medical Officer of Health AND THE Chief Public Health Inspector FOR THE YEAR 1963 (1) BOROUGH OF MALDEN AND COOMBS ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1965 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Maiden. July, 1964 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1963 which has been prepared in accordance with the Ministry of Health Circular 1/64. Preparatory work for the implementation of the London Government Act of 1962 has involved, among other things, a certain amount of examination of old files and records, including annuax reports as far back as 1897. While there is little merit in reminiscence for nostalgia's sake, even a cursory study of these old reports illustrates the progress which has been made in the promotion of community health and offers encouragement to the tasks which confront us today. Our predecessors have acted with fair success in controlling those factors in the environment which were harmful to health even though their knowledge of the cause was incomplete and in some cases, incorrect. Although the diseases have changed, the pattern of preventive work remains the same. We should not curtail the application of such knowledge as we have concerning the prevention of disease because the cause is not yet fully understood. The known facts can be used to control those features of (2) the environment known to be harmful in modern times just as in days gone by. This is true far the modern epidemics of lung cancer, bronchitis, coronary thrombosis and dental caries just as it was in farmer times for tuberculosis, diphtheria and typhoid fever. The control of causally related circumstances associated with these diseases, atmospheric pollution, cigarette smoking and possibly diet, is the modern equivalent of the efforts made to improve sanitation, housing, nutrition and child care during the first half of the century. The statistical tables later in this report have been extended to cover a greater span of years than usual, illustrating the progress made in the control of infectious diseases by improved sanitation and living conditions, protective immunisation and modern therapeutic measures. The death rate for 1963 is little different from that of 1897, but the expectation of life far a child of one year old has increased from 40 odd years to some 70 years. This is due to decreased importance of infectious diseases as a major cause of death in the younger age groups, being replaced by the cardiac, respiratory and malignant diseases which largely affect older people. Accidents are now the commonest cause of death between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Also included in the report is a list of welfare services available in the Borough which it is hoped will be of value as a source of reference. A few extracts from early annual reports are reproduced belcw. Although they are taken out of context I hope they bear illuminating witness to the achievements of the Borough in managing its hygiene affairs over the past 60 years. It is my pleasure to express appreciation of the encouragement and support- of the members of the Public Health Committee and Council during the year and to thank Mr. Kintan and the staff of the department for their enthusiasm and unfailing sense of duty, I am, Mr. Mayer, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. WESTCOMBE. Medical Officer of Health. (3) EXTRACTS FROM PREVIOUS ANNUAL REPORTS Diphtheria, "1897. At Old Maiden the three cases occurred in one family and was contracted by one of the children inhaling sewer gas when walking over the new main in Cheam Road. The parents not recognising the gravity of the disease did not call in medical assistance till all the children were affected. At New Maiden, one case arrived from London as a visitor with sore throat and was received into a London Isolation Hospital, One might have contracted the disease when carting manure from Kingston, in the other case, defective drainage was found, which has been remedied. 1900,. Four cases were notified - 2 in Old Maiden, 2 in New Maiden. All were removed to the Isolation Hospital,, One case of a virulent type, not treated with antitoxin, died soon after admission. The other case in the same house was immediately treated with antitoxin, removed to hospital and did well. Both cases were due to the house drains which have been entirely relaid. 1906. Two cases occurred, one in Old Maiden, which was closely connected, if not caused, by a similar disease in fowls. Many were penned in a dirty yard at the rear of the house. One fowl, found dead, was examined by your Bacteriologist and the specific Bacillus isolated. Cultures and microscopic slides from these cases were later submitted to other scientists in the Kingdom and the finding of your Officer confirmed. Subsequently the Medical Officer of Health for Kent, where fowl breeding is an important industry, reported a similar case. 1910. Under the paragraph "Diphtheria' in my first report to this Council, 1897, the Council were recommended to supply antitoxin to the medical men of this district, and also free bacteriological examination to assist diagnosis. The Council at once adopted my suggestion, they were, I believe, the first district in the County to adopt a scheme that after years, has been issued as an Order of the Local Government Board. The mortality on the first day of the disease was then 22.5. By antitoxin treatment it has been reduced to nil, that is to say, that cases injected on the first day with a sufficient amount of antitoxin all recover." Typhoid Fever. "1897. Five cases were reported,, but not one due to air water supply. Two occurred in Cocmbe; one was removed from the seaside into the district before the disease was discovered; in the other no cause could be found. Three (4) cases occurred in New Maiden - two in one family undoubtedly contracted by inhaling sewer gas. The other may have been caused by defective drainage and drinking water from a foul cistern. 1901 . In February, 3 cases occurred almost simultaneously in one house, 2 children and 1 maidservant were removed to the Tolworth Isolation Hospital where the maid died. The house drains were found to be faulty and leaky, the sewage soaking into the foundations. The drains have been relaid throughout Tuberculosis. "1898. Happily we have so few cases of consumption and other farms of Tuberculosis, that the new popular open-air treatment is not the serious undertaking that it has became to large urban districts, It is undoubtedly a preventable disease and our duty is to prevent in every way possible the transmission of the disease to others, This can be accomplished by distributing leaflets dealing with the disease and its prevention and by informing all the Medical practitioners in the districts that, at their request, in all cases, especially after death, disinfection, including the scraping of the walls and washing with an antiseptic the floors of the rooms of consumptives will be undertaken by the Council free of charge. Such disinfection would undoubtedly diminish the spread of this disease. 1900. The preventive treatment of this disease has received a great impulse from the interest taken in the subject by His present Majesty. His influence has induced the public to take an intelligent interest in the so-called open-air treatment and it is devoutly to be hoped that, in the future, the public sanitary authorities will support their Medical Officers in their endeavour to deal effectually with this disease. I think an advance in the right direction would be to make consumption a notifiable disease. 1211. The Tuberculosis Regulations, 1911, state that every Medical Practitioner attending on,, or called in to visit any person shall within forty eight hours after first becoming aware that such person is suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis, complete, sign and transmit a notification of the case to the Medical Officer of Health far the area in which the place of residence of such person is situated. The Council have decided to afford free Bacteriological Examination to assist the medical men in the district to be accurate in diagnosis. 1912. The treatment of this disease is still in initial stage. Insured persons can obtain sanatorium or domiciliary treatment by the County, each case is seen by the County Tuberculosis Medical Officer, who decides the nature of the treatment; but persons not insured have still to depend for (5) treatment on their own medical attendant, the Workhouse Infirmary and the Hospitals. 1913. Twenty-six cases were notified, twelve more than last year. Early in the year, the Council agreed to the proposed scheme of the Surrey County Council to deal with all cases under the National Insurance Act, the provision of Dispensaries, and the application of the Sanatorium Benefits etc. , Although the scheme has not yet got into proper working order, during the past year we have had the benefit of the qualified Tuberculosis Medical Officer to all cases possible, and this has been most helpful in verifying the diagnosis of the disease and -where possible assisting in obtaining sanatorium treatment for patients he considered eligible for special treatment". PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Acute Poliomyelitis For the second year in succession no case of poliomyelitis was notified in the Borough. Although there have been only seven cases since 1957 it is essential that immunisation continues at its present high level if this position is to be maintained. It is estimated that 73% of the eligible population are protected. The first case of this malady notified in the district was notified on the 25th September, 1913, being a male of 25 years of age. The patient was taken ill on mid-day of September 22nd and died on the morning of September 25th. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1914. (6) Diphtheria The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year; Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 523, school 17) 540 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 826 Par the 16th year in succession the district was completely free frcm this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1899. (7) Whooping Cough The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 6. No deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. 522 children were immunised during the year and 381 received a reinforcing dose. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1939. (8) Tetanus Inoculation, against tetanus has been available since 1956 and is now widely accepted., Although not a common disease, the mortality rate is high and immunisation is recommended. 540 children -were immunised during the year and 741 received a reinforcing doss,. No cases were notified,, Smallpox Details of the number of vaccinations carried out during the year are as follows: Number of primary vaccinations 106 (929) Number of revaccinations 27 (572) (Previous year's figures in parentheses). Of the above, 86 persons were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners and 44 of those vaccinated were tinder 1 year of age. Owing to a change in the age at which vaccination against smallpox is recommended, the number of children vaccinated is fewer than usual. Whereas infants were formerly offered vaccination at about three months old, recent studies have indicated that it is more satisfactory to delay until after one year of age. Scarlet Fever The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was 7, giving an incidence rate of 0.15 per thousand population. One or two of the cases were rather less mild than of recent years but happily no serious outcome was reported. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1899. (9) Measles There was a small epidemic of Measles during the first half of the year, 363 cases being notified. There were no deaths recorded from this disease. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1899. (10) Intestinal Infections One case of typhoid fever was notified and admitted to hospital. The patient contracted the infection whilst abroad on holiday and after treatment she recovered and was discharged. Fifteen cases of sonne dysentery were notified and investigated by the department, 13 families being affected. The majority of the cases were school children and I am glad to say were notified sufficiently early to prevent extensive spread of the infection. No case of food poisoning was returned during the year. Intestinal infections are by no means all identifiable or notifiable. A very considerable number of cases occur as minor troublesome illnesses which spread from person to person and family to family. They are usually the result of faulty personal or food hygiene, while the 'human factor' is always advanced as an irremediable excuse for imperfection. In the whole field of hygiene I am not convinced that standards in general are anything like as high as they could be. There is a limit to what can be done for the community in this respect, at some stage the point is reached when people must regulate their own individual habits if improvement is to be achieved. (11) Dysentery. The following graph shows the rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population in averaged 5 yearly periods from 1934. Non-notifiable Diseases Head teachers of Local Education Authority schools notify cases of non-notifiable disease occurring in their schools. This is a useful procedure which is much appreciated., Mumps and Chickenpox were the two most prevalent during the year.

Pulmonary Tuberculosis (22) MORTUARY The Council's mortuary is still closed and the arrangements continued with the Wimbledon Borough Council for bodies to be received in the mortuary at Gap Road, Wimbledon. 46 bodies were received in the mortuary. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 47. It was necessary to take action under this Act for the removal to hospital of two persons during the year. Preventive -work is constantly carried out for old people brought to the notice of the Public Health Department as being possibly in need of care and attention. Usually it is found possible to maintain the old people either in their own homes with the help of the various Statutory and Voluntary Services available, or by gaining their voluntary admission to hospital or to County Welfare Homes. Section 50. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistarce Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for three burials. ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME An analysis of returns received from the Ambulance Service is shown in the table below.

July, 1964. To the Mayer, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe. Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year 1963. Staff changes were few during the year under review. Mr. S. S. Lowe left the service of the Council in March and he was replaced by Mr. J. M. W. Rands from Woking Urban District Council in July. The career prospects of members of the staff in the forthcoming amalgamation with Kingston and Surbiton are uncertain and it is extremely unsettling for every member of the staff to realise that his or her future will be affected, but it is fitting to pay tribute to their loyalty in these circumstances. In particular, I record with appreciation the long service of the Chief Clerk, Mr0 F» W. W0 Mitchell who has been in the Department for 33 years, Mrs. A. Savage 20 years and Mr. B. LI. Prichard 18 years. Whilst the report which follows might be regarded as routine and statistical, it is also a record of co-operation by members of the Department with residents, managements and workers in a great variety of circumstances. This is an essential feature of the Council's public health policy and in these days mere and more of the work of Public Health Inspectors and their colleagues succeeds because of good public relations. (32) The emphasis of the year's activity has been upon food inspection, improvement of houses and clean air vrork. During the year legislation was introduced making it compulsory to inspect animals at the time of slaughter. This important measure comes vi/hen home produced meat is less affected with tuberculosis than ever before. In spite of our efforts, the number of owners applying for grants for the improvement of houses has been disappointing. In the field of smoke control the Gas Council's policy of producing gas from sources other than coal resulted in a reappraisal of the domestic fuel supply situation. As with worthy public health ventures in the past. it is to be expected that there will be difficulties before the air we breathe is freed from impurities, but it is heartening to learn that London's smoke pollution has been reduced by sixty per cent. during the last ten years according to the estimates of Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. It should be remembered that the process of introducing smoke control areas is also one of modernisation, bringing with it greater efficiency of combustion and better standards of heating and comfort. The intensely cold winter of 19&3 caused the Department concern over the plight of old people living alone and the splendid work of the local voluntary organisations is acknowledged. The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, when implemented, will produce a better standard in premises which have not previously been subject to public health law. At the time of writing this report, the press and television are bombarding the public with news of an outbreak of Typhoid in Aberdeen alleged to be due to a faulty tin of corned beef. Much has been said about the consequences of this incident but it is emphasised that such occurrences would be common if it were not for the standards of food handling which are maintained by responsible members of the food handling and catering trade and the ceaseless vigilance of the Public Health Inspectors and their colleagues. In the defence against food and water borne disease there can be no complacency. In seeking to attain a healthier environment, the fundamentals of health education and the practice of cleanliness are still essential. The department continued to co-operate with the Forest Products Research Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in connection with the control of timber pests and atmospheric pollution respectively. (33) In conclusion I urould like to record once more my appreciation of the support vshich has been given by the Council and by Dr0 Westcombe and of the co-operation of all the members of the staff „ I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, P. E. KIMTON. Chief Public Health Inspector. (34) EXTRACTS PROM EARLIER REPORTS As this is probably the last Annual Report of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe to be produced in this form, readers may be interested in some random excerpts from Annual Reports which have been produced during the last 75 years. 1889 - Water. "I hope at no distant date the district mil have a constant supply and at a moderate rate". "As your district increases the need for a mortuary -will be felt more and more". Well. "On inspecting -where a man resided -who had contracted typhoid, I found the -water supply -was obtained from a well under the bedroom". 1904- - Overcrowding. "In one case the overcrowding was abated by the -whole family, 14 in number, leaving the district". 1906 - Cowsheds, "One cowshed was occupied which contravened all the regulations of the Public Health Act". Milk Samples. (Before the introduction of pasteurisation). "48.7% were pure. 7.5% were infected with tubercle. 17.9%& were infected with pus germs. 25.5% were infected with bacillus producing epidemic diarrhoea". 1907 - Deaths. "Total deaths of all ages belonging to the district was 90; 8 were inmates of Public Institutions; 1 a visitor; 3 died from accidental death; 1 died from shock following immersion in the Hoggs Mill stream". Institutions. "The new Workhouse Buildings, Norbiton Common, house 70 inmates. The Scattered Homes for Children, Kingston Road, house 85 inmates". Children. "The majority of the children appear to be better clothed and nourished than they were formerly - they seem happy at their work. But still there remain many children physically and nervously in an impoverished condition. (35) The general condition of life, however, of the class from which these children are drawn, has greatly improved during the last 30 years. Their stunted growth, both mental and physical, is largely due to the neglect of these general conditions which provide proper amount of sleep, cleanliness and ventilation which govern the nourishment of childhood. The majority of parents forget the fact that a child's existence from 2 to 7 years of age, of necessity depends on 'Bread' as its staple article of sustenance and, therefore, if it is to be its 'staff of life' it must contain those ingredients that go to build up bone, muscle and brain. The white bread the parents will have and do buy, never has had and never can have, these qualities. The maxim 'the whiter the loaf the more nourishing the bread' is a conplete fallacy. The flour, mostly 'Bakers Whites' of which the white bread of the day is made, is rich only in starch, -which contributes to the production of heat and fat. Pure nourishing bread is as necessary to the child as pure milk to the infant and they can be obtained in bread made from flour 'stone-ground' in vogue 30 years ago, which contains that part of the wheat rich in those ingredients which produce bone and muscle. The Baker is not responsible for the false standard of whiteness, but the public who mistrust the dark loaf; and add to the bread trouble by giving the child bad Tea instead of milk or milk and water, a diet that is starving to the body and brain, rendering the child mentally powerless to reap the benefit of school instruction. An Enpire is but little use without an Imperial race". 1908 - Institutions. "The new Workhouse Bui 1 dings, Norbiton Common, house 230 inmates". Recreation and Sports. "Maiden Hill Recreation Ground. - It is pleasing to note that the Open Spaces Committee have made a good advance in regard to developing a practical scheme for the systematic laying out of the Maiden Hill Recreation Ground, which will provide a glorious breathing space of 20 acres for the benefit of public health". Flies. "The only remedy for the evil, is extermination." 1909 - Dust. "The urork carried out by the Council under the direction of the Surveyor, of treating the main roads with tar to minimise the dust nuisance, was extended during the past year and proved highly successful and a boon to the tradesmen and residents of the roads affected". Inspection of Meat in Slaughterhouses. "The only proper solution of this difficulty is the compulsory slaughter of animals in a public slaughterhouse or abbatoir, but this, of course, vrould be of little avail unless carried out in every district". (36) 1910 - Plague, "In November, a memoranda was received from the Local Government Board advising as to the destruction of rats as carriers of Plague which had suddenly appeared in Suffolk" 1911 - Wallpapering. "I have found in the inspection of cottages as many as five or six old -wallpapers on the -walls". 1912 - Housing. "The house accommodation is ample for the population, but continued unemployment has driven two families more frequently to occupy the house, facilitating overcrowding". School Children. "The physical condition of the children has improved, but a large number attend in any but a cleanly condition. A nurse, appointed by the Education Committee visits all the schools systematically, examining the children, reporting to the Sanitary Authority any case die finds which appears to be in a dirty or verminous condition. In such cases the homes of the children are inspected, the clothing and rooms disinfected and cleansed". Milk. "The most effective method of preventing contamination after reception, is for the householder to purchase the milk in sealed bottles -which are easily cleansed and sterilised". Public Conveniences. "The provision of a public convenience by Maiden Fountain -was considered by the Committee and instructions given to the Surveyor to present one or two suggested schemes at a future date". 1915 - Rag Flock. "Now, however, we have a standard of cleanliness respecting Rag Flock, why not have a standard for horse hair?". 1919 - Rabies. "Between April 11th and 14th, a rabid dog was -wandering between Ealing and Woking and some persons were bitten. A child was bitten by a dog -which -was afterwards found to be free from rabies, but arrangements had been made -with the Pasteur Institute in Paris, so that treatment could be undertaken". (37) 1923 - Tents, Vans etc. "Considerable trouble was experienced at the beginning of the year with an encampment of tents and vans used for habitation and vigorous steps had to be taken to prevent Hie nuisance and annoyance occasioned thereby"„ 1930 - Smoke Abatement. "During the year the Council made a Eyelaw under Section 2 of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, which has the effect of prescribing that the emission of black smoke for a period of two minutes etc. etc. be presumed to be a nuisance". 1934 - Unemployment. "The average number of Maiden men unemployed was 120." 1936 - Infestation. "A number of complaints were received from one of the new building estates regarding the prevalence of beetles". 1938 - Vacant Land. "As the district is becoming more and more built up the trouble due to vacant plots of land becoming dump heaps for rubbish tends to diminish". HOUSING The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year - (a) by the Council ... ... 5 (b) by private enterprise ... ... 58 Number of houses in course of construction - (a) by the Council ... ... 52 (b) by private enterprise ... ... 157 c For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served - Preliminary ... ... 30 Abatement ... ... 5 These figures do not include verbal notices often given with regard to minor matters. (38) REGISTERED COMMON LODGING- HOUSES There are no registered common lodging houses in the district. HOUSES IN MJLTIFLE OCCUPATION In this district there are few houses to which the Housing Act, 1961 refers. The Council required the owner of one house which was let in rooms to provide essential facilities and reduce the number of occupants. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, as amended by the Housing Act, 1961, provides for local authorities to make grants to owners for improvement of their property. There are two types of grant available, the 'Standard' and the 'Discretionary' grant. The 'Standard Grant' is available for the 00st of installing a bath, water closet in or readily accessible from within the building, hot -water system, -wash hand basin and satisfactory facilities for storing food. The local authority must approve a grant provided the dwelling is likely to remain fit for human habitation for not less than 15 years and the applicant has a freehold interest or a leasehold interest of which not less than 15 years remains unexpired. The maximum amount of 'Standard Grant' idiich is 50% of the cost of carrying out the -vrork, shall not exceed £155 if all the following facilities are provided. The maximum amount of grant payable for each facility is as follows; Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom £25 Wash hand basin £5 Hot water supply £75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling £40 Satisfactory facilities for storing food £10 On completion, the dwelling must possess all the above amenities. The Council has continued to give 'Discretionary Grants' for works of improvement or conversion up to a cost of £800 and subject to a grant up to 50% of this cost. Generally speaking Discretionary Grants are given inhere extensive work is necessary to provide modern amenities, for example, the construction of a bathroom extension to an existing house. (39) The Housing Act, 1961, came into operation in October, 1961, and authorised an increase in the rent by 12½% of the cost incurred by the owner in carrying out the improvements made to property. In April, 1962, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government made it clear that every facility should be given to encourage the making of grants in suitable cases and to preserve structurally sound houses with a substantial life by improving their amenities. As a result the Council decided to publicise improvement. grants by posters and by exhibitions and to survey selected roads with a view to encouraging owners to improve their properties. A house to house survey has since been undertaken in selected roads and a mobile exhibition unit was stationed in the Borough for a week. During the year numerous enquiries were made by ratepayers and advice was given. Although many did not avail themselves of the facilities offered, a considerable amount of work has been carried out. The following tables show the number of grants approved and payments made during the year; Standard Grants.

A sample of rose hip syrup described as containing glucose was submitted to the Public Analyst -who reported that it contained liquid glucose or starch syrup, a substance of very different composition. In addition, if regarded as a food, the precise ingredients must be specified in accordance with the provisions of the Labelling of Pood Order, 1953 and sulphur dioxide and colouring must be specified. The manufacturers amended their label. Strawberry Pie Filling. A sample of strawberry pie filling imported from a Commonwealth country -was described as containing 'vegetable gum' instead of the specific name 'locust bean gum'. The labels were amended on reprinting. Rhubarb in Syrup. A can of 'Rhubarb' was f ound to contain syrup and this was not declared on the label. The canners undertook to amend their labels on reprinting. American Hamburgers in Gravy. A can of American Hamburgers in Gravy was labelled as containing seasonings and as this is a generic and not a specific description the canner was requested to amend the label to comply with the Labelling of Food Order, 1953- This he undertook to do but, at the time of writing, a copy of the amended label is awaited. Cultivated Blackberries. A sample described as Cultivated Blackberries was submitted to the Public Analyst. The product should have been described as 'Cultivated Blackberries in Syrup' and the canners were advised accordingly and the labels were amended. (45) Plums. A sample of Victoria plums (Selected Dessert) which should have been described as 'Victoria Plums in Light Syrup' was purchased. Following correspondence with the manufacturer attempts were made to obtain a formal sample of this product but without success at the time of writing. MILK The following licences have been issued under the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1963, for the period ending 31st December, 1965: Dealer's (Pre-packed Milk) Licence. Tuberculin tested 12 Pasteurised 19 Sterilised 10 DETAILS OP MILK TESTING % CLASS OF MILK NUMBER OF SAMPLES TESTED APPROPRIATE TESTS NUMBER OF SAMPLES PASSED FAILED VOID Pasteurised 39 Phosphatase Methylene blue 39 - - 38 - 1 Sterilised 4 Turbidity 4 - - Tuberculin tested (Pasteurised) 21 Phosphatase Methylene blue 21 _ _ 21 - - Tuberculin tested (Raw) 3 Methylene blue 3 - - Tuberculin tested (Farm Bottled) 2 Biological 2 - - The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. (46) The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. Void samples are those received at the laboratory at a time when atmospheric shade temperature exceeds 70°F. FOOD There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business together with the number of inspections.

FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year 30 complaints concerning food were received and investigated. Biscuits„ A complaint was received concerning an infestation in a packet of biscuits and the company's stocks were examined and advice given regarding the inspection of stock in other shops. Cakes. A fruit bun was found to contain to small stones, but on considering the circumstances under which the stones were found, the Public Health Committee decided to take no action. Stale cakes were sold by a local retailer who had acquired his stock from a Midlands baker. As a result of representations made by the department improved supply arrangements were introduced. Sausage. Some sandwiches made with sausage were brought to the Public Health Department. Partially embedded in a piece of sausage was a rubber band. As there was an element of doubt concerning the time the rubber band gained access to the sausage the Public Health Committee decided not to proceed against the manufacturers. Bread. A loaf of white bread was found to contain grease which, on examination, proved to be of vegetable origin and used for lubrication of the bakehouse machinery. The Public Health Committee considered the circumstances and the baker was advised that a repetition would be regarded seriously. (48) Sausage Roll. A sausage roll -was found to be affected with mould when eaten. The Public Health Committee considered all the circumstances and decided to advise the manufacturer of their attitude should there be a further complaint. Chocolate-coated Nuts. Evidence of an insect infestation was found in chocolate-coated nuts and fruit. A microscopical examination failed to reveal further evidence and the stock of the shop was inspected and found to be satisfactory. Bottle of Milk. A ball of wool was found in a bottle of milk, but the condition of the milk in other respects was sound and the wool had passed through the cleansing process. The Public Health Committee considered all the circumstances and in this instance decided not to take proceedings. Complaints concerning Italian canned tomatoes, swiss roll, a Christmas pudding, a loaf with crumbs inside, a cracked milk bottle, fruit jelly, the effect of cream on silverware, a chipped milk bottle, a mouldy loaf which was not brought to the department for many days, stewed lamb, cloudy calf's foot jelly, grapes with an odour of fish, were among other investigations undertaken by the Department. ICE CREAM Fifty-four samples were submitted to the methylene blue test. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a single and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended: "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade 1, 80 per cent into grades 1 or 11, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947s- (49) Year Samples Taken Grades % Grade £ Grade % I or II III IV 1947 29 13 44.8 13 44.8 3 10.4 1948 84 55 65.4 22 26.2 7 8.4 1949 63 54 85.7 8 12.7 1 1950 85 81 95.3 4 4.7 0 — 1951 79 74 93.7 5 6.3 0 — 1952 76 71 93.4 5 6.6 0 — 1953 46 43 93.5 1 2.2 2 4.3 1954 51 39 76.5 9 17.6 3 5.9 1955 40 37 92.5 2 5.0 1 2.5 1956 52 48 92.3 4 7.7 0 — 1957 54 54 100.0 0 — 0 — 1958 56 56 100.0 0 - 0 — 1959 38 38 100.0 0 — 0 — 1960 46 46 100.0 0 — 0 — 1961 58 57 98.3 1 1.7 0 — 1962 50 50 100.0 0 - 0 — 1963 54 53 98.1 0 - 1 1.9 During recent years there has been a tendency for ice-cream to be marketed by a few companies with adequate facilities for maintaining the high standard required for this product. This trend has culminated in the merger of some of the biggest producers, leaving few competitors in the field of bulk production and retail distribution. This simplifies sampling procedures but does not necessarily reduce the need for vigilance. The sample in grade IV was produced within the Borough and all subsequent samples -were placed in category I. This followed consultation with the manufacturer concerned. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961 This Act*, which perpetuates regulations made under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, requires that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year and advice was given to traders dealing in second-hand appliances. RAG- FLQCK AND OTHER FILLING- MATERIALS ACT, 1951 One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. (50) Two samples were submitted to the Prescribed Analyst who gave a satisfactory report on each, PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT, 1950 There are 387 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation washing facilities, heating, lighting, ventilation and shop hours relating to early closing and Sunday trading. REFUSE TIP AND REFUSE DISPOSAL. Refuse from the area is collected under the direction of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and transported to a loading bay used jointly by this Council, the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames and the Borough of Surbiton. Prom the loading bay the refuse is conveyed by contractors to disused gravel pits at Egham. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION The duties of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, were fully carried out and householders appreciate the free service which has been maintained. A charge is made for the treatment of business premises, some of which are liable to frequent infestation. Many traders have entered into an annual agreement with the Council to provide a comprehensive inspection and destruction service. This service is also used by the Surrey County Council for their school kitchens, old peoples homes and nurseries. The resultant prompt discovery or notification of the presence of rats or mice and their immediate treatment ensures that serious infestations do not occur. The Borough river boundaries, depots, sewage disposal works refuse tip and open spaces have received constant attention. The efforts of the staff coupled with the co-operation of those of adjoining authorities have maintained effective control. (51) Constant liaison has been maintained with the officers of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood and Workable Area Committee meetings have been held from time to time at which difficulties and new methods of pest control were discussed. PIGEONS Reduction of the pigeon population in built up areas has been carried out successfully under licence from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. INSECT PESTS As in previous years the department was able to be of assistance by giving advice and help to members of the public who suffered inconvenience from insect pests, including bees, hornets, carpet beetles and ants. Nuisance was experienced from wasps during the summer and the department gave all possible assistance and advice. 101 wasp nests were destroyed and the cost of the work was recovered from the occupiers of the premises. 8 rooms were treated for infestations of bugs and 7 rooms for fleas. 61 council houses were inspected for evidence of vermin. A survey of houses for evidence of dry rot and timber infestation was continued during the year to ascertain the extent of nuisance from these sources. Infestations of mites in houses and flats recently erected on vacant land continue to be a nuisance. CARAVANS There are no caravan sites in the Borough and no licences were granted to station moveable dwellings in the area. WATER SUPPLY The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses.

DRAINAGE AMD SEWERAGE With the exception of a small quantity which is discharged to the sewage disposal works of the Borough of Sutton and Cheam at Worcester Park and to the Wandle Valley Joint Sewage Board, the sewage of the district is treated at the modern works of the North Surrey Joint Sewage Board, situated within the Borough. (53) CLEAN AIR Smoke Control Areas. Good progress was made during the year in establishing smoke control areas and on the 1st October, 1963 the No.3 Smoke Control Area came into operation. The survey of No.4 Smoke Control Area was completed and the Order confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The Order which covers the area bounded by the southern side of Maiden Way, Beverley Brook on the north-eastern boundary, the railway lines (Motspur Park to Worcester Park and Maiden Manor) and the eastern side of Maiden Road, comes into operation on the 1st October, 1964. A survey of the Malden and Coombe Norbiton Estate No. 1 Smoke Control Area was also completed and the Order confirmed by the Minister. This Order which covers the area bounded on the western side by the Borough boundary, on the north-eastern side by the New Maiden - Kingston railway line to its junction with the public footpath leading from Dickerage Lane to Norbiton Common Road on the eastern side by the footpath, the rear boundary fences of 6-18 (consecutively) , War-wick Road, the boundary fences of the Fitzgeorge and Mount Schools to its junction with the school playing field, "the eastern boundary of the playing field to its junction with Kingston Road, and on the south-western side by Kingston Road from the junction of the playing field with Kingston Road to the Borough boundary, comes into operation on the 1st October, 1965. The survey of the proposed No.5 Smoke Control Area was commenced during the year. At the end of the year under review, a White Paper 'Domestic Fuel Supplies and the Clean Air Policy' was presented to Parliament by the Minister of Power. The conclusions are quoted; (1) Adequate supplies of solid smokeless fuel for open grates will continue to be available to meet the needs of existing smoke control areas including those confirmed but not yet in operation. Supplies, particularly of the reactive fuels, are however, likely to fall increasingly short of requirements for new areas. (2) Further efforts by producers to increase the output of open-fire fuels and to switch supplies from commercial and industrial users should improve matters. It is important that all the producers concerned should take such action as far as can be economically justified and should also examine the case for bringing demand and supply into better balance by price adjustments. (54) (3) Increased use of closed appliances (including openable stoves) and under-floor-draught open grates is desirable. (4) Gas, oil and electricity provide acceptable alternatives to solid fuels for a large proportion of householders in smoke control areas. These industries should have little difficulty in expanding supplies to the extent necessary to fill the gap in the supply of solid smokeless fuels although in the case of electricity it is desirable that space heating should be done by storage, and not by direct-acting, appliances. (5) The availability and attractiveness of the different smokeless fuels in relation to each other will vary from place to place. Local authorities should consult closely with the fuel and power industries before preparing smoke control orders. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government advised Local Authorities on proposed changes in policy whereby the type of appliances which would be eligible for grant would have to be capable of burning hard coke, unless there were adequate supplies of other fuels, including gas coke, to meet the needs of proposed areas. Existing Smoke Control Areas and areas already confirmed but not in operation, would be unaffected by the proposals. In considering the proposed No.5 Smoke Control Area, the Council received assurances from the fuel suppliers, that adequate supplies of solid smokeless fuel, other than hard coke, would be made available for that particular area and on the basis of these assurances, the Order was submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. The Council considered the implications of the white Paper and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government circular and bearing in mind the imminent amalgamation with Kingston and Surbiton, decided to refer to the new Council decisions on future smoke control policy. During the year 5,182 visits were made in connection with the introduction of smoke control areas and the Mobile Exhibition of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation visited the Borough on two occasions.

NOISE ABATEMENT No formal action was necessary under the provisions of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, but a number of complaints were dealt with informally. The Act provides that a complaint of the existence of a nuisance may be made by three or more persons each of whom is the occupier of land or premise: and in that 'capacity is aggrieved by the nuisance. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration from aircraft and in proceedings it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means have been adopted for preventing the nuisance.
