The breast and channel of High Street, Wapping, have been repaired, where dangerous—near the Hermitage Stairs. The breast and channel of the carriage way, in Red Mead Lane, Wapping, have been repaired where dangerous. Alterations have been made to the carriage way paving, opposite the stables of Mr. Gillies, in Havering Street, Ratcliff. 39 SPECIAL PAVING. Pursuant to the directions of the Board, estimates of the cost of paving the following streets in the parish of Limehouse have been prepared, and apportionments of the sums to he paid by the several owners of land and houses abutting on such streets have been made, and orders for payment of the several apportioned sums have been served upon such owners. The following is a list of the several streets, and the estimates of the costs of paving, &c., resjiectively :— Street. Estimate of cost of paving. Pod Street £851 10 8 Francis Street 778 2 0 Felling Street 153 16 2 Silver Street 115 16 7 Farrant Terrace 78 11 0 Spencer Street 145 6 5 Thomas Street 1,239 5 0 Railway Place 84 15 3 The severul apportioned amounts are being paid by the owners of the property, pursuant to the orders served upon them. LIGHTING. The number of public lamps in the district is 746, being an increase of one on the number reported at Ludy-day, 1869. The attention of the Hoard having been called to the neglected and dirty state of the public lamps, and also to the fact that in some parts of the district the lamps were not lighted until after dark, and that the light given by the burners was insufficient, the attention of the Gas Companies have been called to the matter, and instructions have been given to the inspectors to make inspections from time to time of the lamps throughout the district during the evening and night, and to report thereon to the Board. 40 PUBLIC URINALS. There has been no increase in the number of Urinals in the ilistrict. The Urinals are flushed and cleansed with water by men employed by the Board. CLEANSING & WATERING. The principal paved streets are cleansed daily, and the others not less than twice a week. During the past season the whole of the streets, Ac., have been constantly watered by the contractors with water from the East London Water Works. RENUMBERING STREETS, &C. The Metropolitan Board of Works have made orders fur re-naming the following thoroughfares, and for renuntbeiing the houses therein, viz :— Green Bank, and Old Gravel Lane, in the respective parishes of St. Georgein-the East, and St. John, Wupping. Orders have been served upon the occupiers of the houses in such thoroughfares in the district to alter the numbers accordingly. IMPROVEMENTS. Limehouse.—The making up, paving, and lighting of Narrow Street, and the new street from Risbie's Hope Walk are completed, and the paving of the portion of RisLie's Rope Walk from the new street to the Limehouse Cut Bridge is complete, and opened for traffic. The new roads in communication with the Regent's Canal improvements are completed. 41 Ratcliff. The making up, paving, and lighting of the Horseferry Road is completed. Shadwell.—(New Crane.)— The freehold of the piece of ground in New Crane belonging to the Ratcliff Gas Company has been purchased for £l,200, and the boundary wall of their premises has been set back to complete the improvement. The sum of £600 has been paid by the Company to the Board for permission to have the foot bridge across New Crane. The sum of £4,521..11.5, being one-half of the cost of the improvement, has been paid over to this Board by the Metropolitan Board of "\Vork3. In reference to the proposed Steam Boat Pier at Limehouse I have, pursuant to the direction of the Board, had interviews with the Secretary and Engineer of the Thames Conservancy Board upon the subject, and that Board having deisred to the take opinion of this Board as to the situation of the Tier— whether it should be at or near Ratcliff Cross Stairs, or at or near Duke Shore Stairs, the matter was duly considered by the Board, and it was decided that, in their opinion, Ratcliff Cross Stairs is the place best suitable for a Steam Boat Pier for the convenience of the public generally. Notice has been given, and plans have been deposited for the construction of certain tramways in the East of London. The only ones which affect this District are Tramways Nos. 1 and la, situate in the Commercial Road East, commencing at a point about 20 feet west of the Toll-gate near Limehouse Church, and terminating in the parish of Whitechapel, near to Church Lane. The matter has been referred to the Works and Survey Committee, with power to make such arrangements with the promoters as they may deem expedient. The Great Eastern Railway Company have re-constructed the bridge carrying the Railway over Devonport Street, Ratcliff. In reference to the diversion of certain sewer outlets in Limehouse from the River Thames, the Metropolitan Board of Works have sanctioned the plan of the new sewers necessary for the purpose, and arranged between myself and Mr. B.izalgettc, the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board, and have decided 42 on executing the works for effecting the desired diversions at an estimated cost of .£4,600. The new sewers will be constructed in the following streets, viz.:—part of Limehouse Causeway to Spread Eagle Street, along part of Spread Eagle Street, West Street, under property on the east side of Three Colt Street, across Three Colt Street, through Ropemakers' Fields, along Nightingale Lane, part of Risbie's Rope Walk, and Linton Place. The Metropolitan Board of Works have had charcoal ventilators fixed to the ventilators of the following streets, viz.:— To the Low Level Main Sewer, opposite 13, Broad Street, Ratcliff; Cable Street, Shadwell; opposite Glamis Road, Shadwell. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surctyor qf the Board. 3968 BOARD OF WORKS rob the LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for the Year ending Lady-day, 1870. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIME HOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honor to submit to you my Annual Report on the sanitary condition of the Limehouse District during my first year of office ended March 20th, 1870. The population of the District over which you possess jurisdiction is about 00,000. The area of the district is 576 acres, and the number of inhabited houses is about 7,500. These figures give an average of 104 persons to the acre, and 8 persons to a house. This population comprises a considerable portion of the labouring element, the people composing which earn their livelihood—at the best a scanty and precarious one—in the docks, warehouses, and on the river. For the most part they know no trade ; they have been labourers from their youth; they work while they can, and when old age or disease advances upon them, they find a refuge in the workhouse. As might be expected among people of this class, I have found gross ignorance, great poverty, and much dirt. They are distinguished by a supreme contempt for the commonest sanitary laws, and when appliances usually supposed to be conducive to the preservation of health are placed at their disposal, they fail to use them. Improvements that I have suggested, and your Board have had carried into effect iu their dwellings, have in many 2 instances, on my next visit, disappeared, or have been so damaged or neglected as to necessitate the work being done again. On the other hand, their houses in many cases are much dilapidated, and have been built without any idea of promoting either the comfort or the health of the occupants ; indeed in one locality the dilapidations were of so serious a nature, and the insalubrity so pronounced, that proceedings were commenced by your Board under the Artizans' Dwelling Act, against the owners. Let us now examine, by the help of a few statistics, the sanitary state of the population, the social condition of a large proportion of which is represented in the above statement. In the period under consideration, 1,926 births and 1,513 deaths were registered—the population thus receiving an accession of 413 to its number. The following table exhibits the number of births registered in each subdistrict, the quarter when registered, and the sex : — Sub-districts. Midsummer Michaelmas. Chriitmat. Ladyday. Total. Male. Fem. Male Fem. Male Fem. Male. Fem. Male. Fem. Limehouse 116 115 128 123 149 137 145 156 538 531 Ratcliff 53 61 66 59 68 61 78 64 265 245 Shadwell&Wapping 40 40 43 38 56 48 46 36 185 162 Total 209 216 237 220 273 246 269 256 988 938 425 457 519 1,926 From this table it will be seen that the greatest number of births was registered in the quarter ended Lady-day, and the least in the quarter ended Midsummer, the difference between the numbers being 100. The annual birth rate was 32 per 1,000 for the whole district. Of the 1,513 persons whose deaths were registered in the year, 783 3 wore males, and 740 females. The following table exhibits the number recorded in each sub-district, and the quarter when registered:- Sub-districts. Mid. summer. Michaelmas. Christmas. Ladyday. Population Total. Limehouse 157 152 201 164 30,000 674 Ratcliff 123 109 116 113 17,000 461 Shadwell & Wapping 93 82 100 103 13,000 378 Total 373 343 417 380 60 000 1513 From this table it is apparent that the largest number of deaths was registered in the quarter ended Christmas, and the least in the quarter ended Michaelmas. diseases of local character, as Bronchitis and Pneumonia, tended to swell the death sheet of the Christmas quarter, and during this period the deaths From Scarlatina and Small-Pox reached their maximum, being 52 and 17 respectively. Of the total deaths 434, or 28.6 per cent., were those of children under one year, and 433, or 28.5 per cent., those of children above one and under five years. Eight hundred and sixty-seven, or 57.1 per cent, of the total deaths were therefore those of children under 5 years. Scarlatina, Hooping Cough, Diarrhœa, Tabes Mesenterica, Convulsions, Bronchitis, and Pneumonia were the principal agents in producing this lamentable result, assisted by Small Pox, Measles, and Debility. The annual death rate was 25 per 1,000, coinciding exactly with that of the Metropolis. The following table exhibits the number of deaths clue to the different classes into which it has been found convenient to divide disease, together 4 with the quarters during which they were registered, and the average temperature :— Class. Midsummer Av. Tcm. 51.1 Michael- ma*. Av. Tcm. 61.3 Christ- ma*. Av. Tern. 45 I.ady. «lav. Av. Tem. 37.8 Total Per cent, of total deaths.

The annual rate of mortality from this class of disease was 7 per 1,000 persons living. It will be noted that the greatest mortality existed in the quarter ended Michaelmas, when the average temperature was 61.3; and the least in the quarter ended Lady-day, during which the average temperature was 37.8. Of all the diseases which are classed as Zymotic, Small-Pox is the most loathsome; from this affection 29 deaths were registered—the victims being principally children, who were in most cases unvaccinated. It is a matter for regret, that although by the discovery of Jenner, means . were placed in our hands for averting this scourge, or at all events for reducing to a minimum the severity of the attack, and the subsequent disfiguration, there are to be found persons who, perversely blind to the experience of years, decry the operation of vaccination. Twenty-five of the deaths were registered in Limehouse, principally in that part of the district known as Limehouse Fields ; four in Ratcliff; while Shadwell and Wapping can show a clean bill of health as regards this disease. Twenty-seven deaths 5 were registered from Measlevof wlich, number seventeen occurred between the ages of 1 and 5 years. Scarlatina caused no less than 152 deaths during the year. It was at its height in the quarter ended Christmas, when it caused 52 deaths; in the following quarter the mortality sank to 15. The importance of devising some means for limiting the epread of the disease was recognized early in the autumn of last year, and suggestions were printed and circulated with that view. All authorities are agreed concerning the extreme infectiousness of the disease, and they all urge, as the basis of successfully combating it, the total isolation of the sick. Where the original Scarlet Fever poison sprang from, or whether it is ever renewed, is not known; but it is no matter of doubt that a person suffering from the disease has power to communicate it to a healthy person. either by means of the discharges from the throat and nose, or by the innumerable small flakes of cuticle thrown off during the stage of desquamation, and not improbably by the secretions of the kidneys, and the alvine evacuation. Each ml all of these contain the Scarlatina poison, and medical men have not unnaturally come to the con. clusion that if the poison so Contained could, on its first exit or separation from the body, be at once destroyed, the disease would terminate where it began. Having this end in view, it is necessary that the infected person be at once separated from the rest of the family ; that the sick room be divested of every thing likely to harbour the minute particles given off from the body, each of which is a fresh centre of disease; that the attendants shouid be those who have had the disease; that no unnecessary communication should be held with the other inmates of the house; that the evacuations should be received at once into some vessel charged with a disinfectant, that all soiled linen, and in fact every thing that has been used by the patient should be disinfected, by immersion in some disinfecting fluid, before leasing the room , 6 and when the cuticle is beginning to desquamate, the patient should be oiled from head to feet, and treated with warm soapy baths. It should be borne in mind that as the desquamating cuticle is the great vehicle of contagion, the period of desquamation is the period of greatest danger. By such means thoroughly and conscientiously carried out, the disease would, if not entirely banished, be rendered a far less frequent visitor. I need hardly say that few of these precautions can be observed in the houses of the poor; to them isolation is an idle word, and they possess neither the means, nor in the majority of cases the intelligence, necessary for the efficient disinfection of their homes. On the other hand, the rich do not like the restrictions imposed on them by a strict observance of the foregoing precautions. If, therefore, the disease is to be dealt with effectually, removal to a suitable place—at least in those cases where it is evident that isolation cannot be practised, or the above simple rules carried out, should be enforced by law. That distressing disease, Hooping Cough, destroyed no less than 89 lives during the year. The greatest mortality from this disease appears to have existed in the quarter ended Christmas, when 28 deaths were registered, and the average temperature was 45° F. From Typhus Fever 12 deaths were registered, of which number 5 occurred in the quarter ended Midsummer, 5 in the quarter ended Michaelmas, and 2 in the quarter ended Lady-day. No death from this cause was registered in the Christmas quarter. In October last I received a communication from the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, drawing my attention to the fact that relapsing Fever had made its appearance in the metropolis. The disease affected principally the vagrant and destitute, hence its synonym "famine fever;” and though itself not of a particularly fatal character, deserved attention from the fact that those attacked were rendered, in consequence of the prostration produced by the peculiar character of the disease, 7 unable for a considerable period to resume their avocations; and in this weak condition they were liable to fall an easy prey to its more dangerous ally — Typhus, which usually followed in its rear. A liberal dietary, close sanitary supervision, and the removal of the infected to the Hospital, were indicated And carried out in the district. During the year 110 cases of Fever (Typhus, Enteric, Continued and Relapsing), were removed to the Hospital; viz., from Ratcliff 41; from Limehouse 20; and from Shadwell and Wapping 43. The locality in Ratcliff that made the largest contribution to this list was London Street, no less than 20 of the 41 cases having been removed therefrom. A minute inspection of this street was made, and many of the houses discovered to be in a filthy condition. In some cases ashpits were required, in others the surface paving was defective, and in three or four the drains were untrapped. With one or two exceptions the houses were let out in tenements, and as usual in such cases over-crowding existed in some of the smaller rooms. The majority of the occupants were pauperised, or very slightly raised above that condition. I need hardly point out that conditions such as these were eminently favourable to the development and propagation of fever. Your Board took decisive steps regarding this street, and I am glad to say that the disease, though not entirely eradicated, is of far less frequent occurrence. Narrow Street, Harris' Court, and its immediate vicinity, and Stepney Causeway, contributed the majority of the remaining cases—poverty, with its concomitants—over-crowding, destitution, and dirt being usually present. In Limehouse, Dalgleish Street and East Row stand out in unenviable prominence as being favourite seats of fever during the year. Of the 26 cases sent by Limehouse to the Hospitals, 7 were from Dalgleish Street, and 5 from East Row (one house.) Dalgleish Street is deficient in drainage, and the 5 cases from East Row were relapsing fever, which, with some others, were received into the London Hospital. They were all paupers. The 8 fever-stricken portions of Shadwell were Brewhouse Street, from which 10 persons were sent to the Hospital, and Victoria Place and Street, from which localities 11 people were removed. In Wapping, Upper Well Alley and Black Jack Alley were the offenders, contributing between them 10 cases. Of the condition of these places I have reported at length in my fortnightly reports. I will therefore merely content myself with observing that most of the houses are small, thereby easily becoming over-crowded, and that they are inhabited by habitual paupers. Diarrhœa was the cause of 65 deaths during the year. Of this number no less than 48 were those of infants under one year, and 14 those of children above one and under five. The greatest mortality was observable in the quarter ended Michaelmas, when 48 deaths were registered, and the average temperature was 61.3°. The least number was registered in the quarter ended Midsummer, when 4 deaths only were recorded, and the average temperature was 51.1°. Many lives were sacrificed to this disease, which might have been saved had medical advice been sought at the onset of the attack. In too many instances this step was delayed until too late to be of any avail, and the little sufferer passed away the victim of neglect or ignorance. The following table exhibits the number of deaths registered from six of the principal Zymotic diseases, with the sub-districts in which they were recorded:— Sub-districts. Small Pox. Measles Scarlatina. Hooping Cough Diarrhœa. T yphus. Total. Limehouse 25 18 83 39 23 5 193 Ratcliff 4 6 42 35 20 5 112 Shadwell & Wapping — 3 27 15 22 2 69 Total 29 27 152 89 65 12 374 Diseases of the Constitutional clas3 caused 239 deaths, or 15.7 per 9 cent. of the total mortality. The annual death rate per 1,000 persons living from this class of disease, was 3.9. Of these 55 deaths were due to Tabes Mesenterica (Consumption of the Bowels), 126 to Phthisis (Consumption), and 32 to Hydrocephalus. The greatest number of deaths from Tabes was registered in the quarter ended Michaelmas, when the number reached 24; and the least in the quarter ended Midsummer, when 7 only were registered. The deaths from Phthisis were distributed over the year as follow:—In the Midsummer quarter 37; in the Michaelmas quarter 25; in the Christmas quarter 30; and in the quarter ended Lady-day 34. As regards age, the period of greatest mortality appears to have been between the years of 20 and 40. That part of your district included in the parishes of Shadwell and Wapping, contributed a proportionately larger number of deaths from this disease than either the Parish of Limehouse or the Hamlet of Ratcliff. Of the 32 deaths from Hydrocephalus 13 were registered in Limehouse, 9 in Ratcliff, and 10 in Shadwell and Wapping; these two latter parishes again contributing more than their share to the deaths from this disease. The following table exhibits the number of deaths registered from the above and the sub-districts in which they were recorded:— Sub districts. Tabes Mesenterica Phthisis Hydro Cephalus. Total. Lmehouse 29 65 13 107 Ratcliff 16 26 9 51 Shadwell and Wapping 10 35 10 55 Total. 55 126 32 213 By far the greatest number of deaths were registered from diseases of a local character, 638, or 42 per cent. of the total number of deaths, being recorded therefrom. The rate of mortality per 1,000 living from this class 10 of disease was 10.6. Passing over diseases of the Nervous System, which caused 178 deaths, and those of the Organs of Circulation, which caused 49, but which present no features of sufficient importance to demand more than this brief notice, we have our attention drawn to the number of deaths registered from diseases of the Respiratory Organs, viz., 322. The greatest number of deaths from these causes was registered in the quarter ended Christmas, when the average temperature was 45°, and the number recorded was 117. The least number was registered in the quarter ended Michaelmas, when the average temperature was 61.3, and the recorded deaths numbered 38. Bronchitis caused the greatest mortality, being credited with 190 deaths—109 of these were those of children under 5 years. From this age until 40 the mortality was trifling, but during the next two vicenniads 71 succumbed to the disease. Pneumonia caused 121 deaths, the period of greatest mortality appearing to be between the ages of 1 and 5 years, after which children under 1 year suffered most. Altogether the deaths of 93 children under 5 years were recorded from this disease. Among diseases of the Digestive Organs we note 13 from Enteritis, 10 from Ascites, and 19 from Diseases of the Liver. Diseases of the Urinary Organs caused 22 deaths, viz., from Nephritis 15, from Bright's Disease 2, and from Kidney Disease (not further defined) 5. Diseases connected with development caused 127 deaths, the period of greatest mortality was the quarter ended Lady-day, when the average temperature was 37.8. Of the total deaths 8.2 per cent. were due to diseases of this class, and the annual rate of mortality therefrom was 2.1 per 1,000 living. Among these the diseases peculiar to children caused 32 deaths, of which 13 were due to premature birth, and 14 to teething. Forty-nine deaths were returned as not being traceable to any distinct disease, but as being simply the result of the decay of nature. Thirty-nine deaths occurred 11 as the result of Atrophy and Debility. Seventy deaths were attributable to violence, a slight excess being noticed in the quarter ended Lady-day. Of the total deaths 4.6 per cent. were due to this cause, and the annual rate of mortality therefrom was 1.1 per 1,000 living. Of these deaths 12 were due to fractures and contusions, 5 to burns and scalds, 37 to drowning, 10 to suffocation, 1 to murder. Five of the deaths were suicides, in which drowning was resorted to in one case, and hanging in 4. In six cases the causes of death were not specified. SANITARY WORK. Several hundred houses were inspected in the district, and though it was neither to be exacted nor desired that in every house visited sanitary defects were to be discovered, still so many faults were brought to light, which Would otherwise have remained unnoticed, that I look upon the systematic house to house visitation as a great sanitary aid. Houses where contagious disease had exited were cleansed, and the sick rooms disinfected; the paper striped from the walls, bedding and clothes when necessary destroyed, ventilation where defective improved, removal to hospital of infectious diseases urged, and disinfectants gratuitously supplied. I take this opportunity of expressing my entire satisfaction at the efficient manner in which the Inspectors performed the duties allotted them. For the particulars of the Sanitary work done, I beg to refer you to Table VI. WATER SUPPLY. The average amount of solid matter per gallon contained in the water supplied by the East London Company was 19 grains, and of organic matter rather less than ½ grain. The total hardness averaged 14 degrees, and the 12 hardness, after boiling, 4 degrees. Such water may be considered usable. In the summary of conclusions and recommendations of the Royal Commission, on the Water Supply of the Metropolis, occur the following words— "We are of opinion that the constant service system ought to be promptly introduced to the farthest extent possible, in the supply of the Metropolis; that it cannot be effectually introduced in London so long as the supply remains in the hands of private Companies, to whom it would be inexpedient to confide the great powers necessary for the purpose." These conclusions I cordially endorse. WORKSHOPS' REGULATION ACT. The various workshops and factories in the district have been visited, and printed forms containing an epitome of the chief sections of the Act distributed. In one case, viz., that of a dressmaker in Albert Street, Shadwell, the young women were kept at work beyond the legal hours on Saturdays. A caution was given, and I have received no further complaint. GAS SUPPLY. Numerous observations have been made of the quality of the gas supplied to your district, the result being that the illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Commercial Gas Company was found to average 14.6 candles. The highest illuminating power was 14.8, and the lowest 14.4. The average amount of sulphur present in all forms was 21.4 grains per 100 cubic feet. The illuminating power of the gas supplied by the Ratcliff Company was found to average 14.1 candles, the highest power attained being 15.4, and the lowest 13 candles. The average amount of sulphur present in all forms was 20.48 grains per 100 cubic feet. As regards this impurity, I may 13 mark that the maximum quantity permitted by Act of Parliament is 20 grains per 100 cubic feet, but great difficulty exists in limiting its presence to this amount. Traces of ammonia were usually present, but sulphuretted hydrogen never. The Parliamentary standard of illuminating power for these Companies is 12 candles. SLAUGHTER AND COW HOUSES. Thirty-two notices of intended applications for licences to Slaughter Houses, and twenty-seven for licences to Cow-Houses having been received by your Board, the various premises were inspected, and the sanitary defects noted during the inspection having been rectified, the licences were granted without opposition. BAKE HOUSES. The numerous bake-houses in the district were inspected, and found to be in good sanitary condition. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, GEORGE ARTHUR ROGERS, Medical Officer.
