Tel : BRIxton 7755 July, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Lambeth. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1961 on the health of the Borough of Lambeth. The Registrar-General's estimated mid-year population for the Borough is 221,960, a decrease of 2,120 on the estimate for 1960, It is likely that the estimate for 1961 is more accurate than the previous year's as it is based ona sample taken at the 1961 census. The total number of deaths and the death rate are both greater than last year but the increase has largly occurred in people over 75 years of age. With an ageing population this is what one would expect. The birth rate at 19.87 per 1000 population shows only a fractional change from last year and the percentage of illegitimate births at 15.6% of total births is fractionally less. The incidence of infectious disease, apart from measles, showed a decrease. Only two cases of poliomyelitis were notified during the year compared with seven in 1960. There were no cases of diphtheria notified and it is gratifying to note that the level of immunisation against this disease, as indicated by figures supplied by the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, has gone up. Expansion continued in the services provided for the aged and close co°Peration in this field is maintained with all bodies, both statutory and voluntary. The scheme for providing holidays for the elderly has continued and been much appreciated by the participants. The shortage of Public Health Inspectors still remains a problem and at the end of the year there were five vacancies on the establishment. 10 In conclusion I am pleased to acknowledge the support given to me by members of the Council and the Public Health Committee in particular. My thanks are due also to the other Chief Officers for their co-operation during the year and to the members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal and conscientious service. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, F.SUMMERS Medical Officer of Health. 11 SECTION A STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Lambeth is one of the largest Metropolitan Boroughs, both in population and area. It has common boundaries with Battersea, Wandsworth, Croydon, Penge, Camberwell, Southwark and the Cities of London and Westminster. The total area of the Borough is approximately 6½ square miles. This area excludes tidal water and foreshore, but includes approximately five acres which have been added to the Borough as a result of the new South Bank embankment, part of the river area having been reclaimed. The land surface rises from 12 feet above sea-level at the river to 50 feet at Brixton, 150 feet at West Norwood and about 379 feet at and near the Crystal Palace. The perimeter of the Borough measures 17% miles. The Borough has approximately 328 acres of open space, including Brockwell, Kennington, Ruskin, Norwood, Archbishop's and Vauxhall Parks and Myatt's Fields. Among the world famous buildings within the boundaries are Lambeth Palace; the Oval cricket ground; the County Hall; the Royal Festival Hall and the Headquarters of the London Fire Brigade. Lambeth is divided into three Parliamentary Divisions, Vauxhall, Brixton and Norwood, each returning one member of Parliament and three members to the London County Council. These Divisions are, in turn, divided into a total of 21 wards for the purpose of Borough Council elections. 12 STATISTICS GENERAL Area of Borough 4,087.5 acres No. of Wards 21 No. of P arliamentary Constituencies 3 Population Figure supplied by Registrar General (Mid-year estimate 1961) 221,960 Density of Population i.e. number of Persons per acre 54.3 Number of marriages during year 1980 Marriage rate per 1,000 Population 8.9 Marriage rate per 1,000 Population England and Wales 15.0 Rateable Value of District (1961/1962) £4,350,139 Sum represented by Penny Rate (1961/62) £17,850 Number of separately rated houses and flats (1961/62) 56,854 BIRTHS Live Births Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 2,096 383 2,479 Females 1,995 373 2,368 Totals 4,091 756 4,847 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 21. 84 Birth Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 19. 87 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 0. 91 13 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 18.9 Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 17.4 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1960 19.55 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total live births 15.6% STILL BIRTHS Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 42 11 53 Females 46 7 53 Totals 88 18 106 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births (i.e. live and still) 21.4 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Home Population 0.48 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 Total Births England and Wales 19.1 DEATHS Males Females Total 1356 1229 2585 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population 11.65 Death Rate corrected for comparison with other areas 11.65 Comparability Factor supplied by Registrar General 1.00 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population England and Wales 12.00 Corresponding Rate for the Borough of Lambeth for the year 1960 10.86 14 Death Rate per 1,000 Home Population County of London 12.00 MATERNAL MORTALITY Number of Women dying in consequence of childbirth 3 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births 0.61 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births County of London 0.51 Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 Total Births England and Wales 0.33 INFANTILE MORTALITY Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 56 8 64 Females 35 10 45 Totals 91 18 109 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births 22.41 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births County of London 22.1 Death Rate of Infants under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, England and Wales 21.6 Legitimate Infantile Mortality rate 22.2 Illegitimate Infantile Mortality rate 23.8 Deaths of Infants under 4 weeks of age Legitimate Illegitimate Total: Males 41 6 47 Females 26 10 36 67 16 83 15 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under four weeks per 1,000 live births) 17.33 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births County of London16.1 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births England and Wales 1S.5 Deaths of Infants under 1 week of age Legitimate Illegitimate Totals Males 39 6 45 Females 24 9 33 63 15 78 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (Deaths under one week per 1,000 live births) 16.1 Perinatal Mortality Rate (Stillbirths and deaths under one week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 37.1 Perinatal Mortality Rate England and Wales 32.2 16 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH SUMMARY OF VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE TEN YEAR PERIOD 1952- 1961 Year Population Deaths *Death Rate Live Births *Live Birth Rate Deaths of Infants under 1 year of age Infantile Mortality Rate Maternal Deaths Maternal Mortality Rate 1952 230,200 2,824 12.27 3,626 14.49 92 25.37 8 2.17 1953 229,000 2,408 10.62 3,649 15.93 93 25.49 4 1.08 1954 226,200 2,298 10.26 3,684 14.33 86 23.34 6 1.59 1955 224,200 2,385 10.74 3,597 14.12 74 20.57 4 1.08 1956 223,900 2,389 11.10 3,915 15.74 83 21.20 1 .25 1957 224,300 2,359 10.83 4,205 16.82 98 23.90 NIL NIL 1958 223,600 2,529 11.65 4,444 17.12 111 24.98 1 .22 1959 223,300 2,483 11.38 4,685 19.09 116 24.76 1 .21 1960 224,080 2,388 10.86 4,802 19.55 101 21.0 2 .41 1961 221,960 2,585 11.65 4,847 19.87 109 22.41 3 .61 * As adjusted by Comparability Factor 17 DEATHS OF LAMBETH RESIDENTS DURING 1961CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO AGE GROUPS AND SEXES CAUSES OF DEATH Under 1 Year 1-4 years 5- 14 years 15-24 years 25-44 years 45-64 years 65-74 years 75 Years and over TOTALS 1.

Births The number of live births assigned to the Borough rose by 45 and this combined with a reduction in the population gives an increased corrected birth rate of 19.87 per 1,000 home population. This rate is slightly higher than that that for England and Wales which is 17.4 per 1,000 population. The number of illegimate births again increased, 756 occuring compared with 724 in 1960 and 644 in 1959. The number of live births exceeded the deaths by 2262 but this natural increase would appear to be offset by movement of population out of the Borough as indicated by the population figure supplied by the Registrar General. Still Births The number of still births increased from 88 to 106 giving an increased still births rate of 21.4 compared with 18.00 in 1960 Deaths The number of deaths increased by 197 giving a corrected death rate of 11.65 per 1,000 home population compared with 10.86 in 1960. This compares favourably with that for England and Wales which is 12.00 per 1,000 home population. As in previous years heart and associated diseases accounted for the largest number of deaths All forms of malignant neoplasms caused 563 deaths, an increase of 46 over the figure for 1960. Deaths from respiratory tuberculosis increased from 15 to 27 but those from other forms of the disease fell by 4, two deaths occuring compared with 6 in 1960- Motor vehicle accidents accounted for 31 deaths compared with 35 last year. 21 The number of suicides again increased, 37 people taking their own lives compared with 34 in 1960. Twenty four males committed suicide compared with 13 females. Two deaths occured as a result of homicide, one less than last year. Infantile Mortality The number of infants dying before reaching 1 year of life rose from 101 last year to 109 giving an increased infantile mortality rate of 22.41 per 1,000 live births. This rate is higher than that for England and Wales which at 21.6 per 1,000 live births was the lowest on record, but approximates to that for the County of London. Of the 109 deaths, 91 were in respect of legitimate infants, one less than last year, and 18 in respect of illegitimate children, an increase of 9. Eighty-three children died in the first four weeks of life compared with 72 in 1960 giving an increased neo-natal mortality rate of 17.33 per 1,000 live births compared with 15.5 for England and Wales and 16.1 for the County of London. Eleven more infants died under 1 week of age than last year, 78 compared with 67, giving an early neo-natal mortality rate of 16.1 per 1,000 live births. Matemal Mortality Three women died as a result of childbirth giving an increased maternal mortality rate of 0.61 per 1,000 total births. This is higher than the rates for england and Wales and the County of London which are 0.33 and 0.51 respectively. Deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus Deaths from Cancer of the Lung and Bronchus increased from 168 in 1960 to 172 during the year under review. Ten fewer men died from the disease but the number of female deaths increased by 14, thirty-three compared with 19 in 1960. The deaths were split amongst the various age groups as follows. The figures in brackets are those for the year 1960. 22 Males Females Totals 25-44 years 5 (2) 2 (2) 7 (4) 45-64 years 66 (73) 15 (10) 81 (83) 65-74 years 48 (56) 7 (3) 55 (59) 75 years and over 20 (18) 9 (4) 29 (22) 139 (149) 33 (19) 172 (168) During the last twelve years 1488 deaths have occurred from lung cancer, whilst over the same period 488 people have died from respiratory tuberculosis. The following graph shows the comparison between the deaths from cancer, of the lung and respiratory tuberculosis. 23 COMPARISON OF DEATHS FROM RESPIRATORY TUBERCULOSIS AND CANCER OF LUNG AND BRONCHUS Cancer of Lung and Bronchus Respiratory Tuberculosis- 24 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS The following tables show the road traffic accidents occurring within the Borough of Lambeth during the year 1961 and the comparative figures and casualties for the period 1954-1961. The figures shown refer not only to Lambeth residents but also to persons living in other areas who were involved in accidents in the Borough. The number Of fatalities shown in these tables may not agree, therefore, with those in the list of causes of death supplied by the Registrar General. The Registrar General's figures refer to Lambeth Residents only, and the death may have occurred within the Borough of Lambeth or outside the district My thanks are due to the Town Clerk for supplying me with the figures. 25 ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 1961 WITHIN THE BOROUGH OF LAMBETH Month No. of Accidents Adults Children Total Killed Seriously Injured Slightly Injured Killed Seriously Injured Slightly Injured January 143 2 30 121 - 5 16 174 February 126 - 14 109 - 3 18 144 March 135 1 19 119 - 5 25 169 April 158 - 14 149 - 3 28 194 May 163 2 25 119 - 6 34 186 June 145 2 13 107 - 8 27 157 July 163 - 38 154 - 7 26 225 August 169 2 23 148 - 7 24 204 September 168 2 24 128 1 2 40 197 October 143 1 33 109 - 7 21 171 November 163 3 27 152 - 3 22 207 December 143 4 21 135 - 2 11 173 totals 1819 19 281 1550 1 58 292 2201 Casualties per mile of road 16.2 26 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH COMPARATIVE FIGURES OF ACCIDENTS AND CASUALTIES FOR THE PERIOD 1954-1961 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Number of accidents involving personal injury 1,032 1,246 1,272 1,212 1,505 1,739 1,890 1,819 Casualties per mile of road 7.29 8.80 8.98 8.56 12.6 14.6 16.2 16.2 Casualty Figures Adults Killed 12 14 12 12 17 21 18 19 Seriously Injured 180 187 174 196 240 254 273 281 Slightly Injured 756 1,002 1,067 1,052 1,293 1,535 3,668 1,550 Totals 948 1,203 1,253 1,260 1,550 1,810 1,99 1,850 Children Killed 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 Seriously Injured 30 35 29 24 45 44 59 58 Slightly Injured 196 189 211 175 193 204 276 292 Totals 227 225 242 200 240 250 338 351 Combined Adults and Children Totals 1,175 1,428 1, 495 1, 460 1,790 2,060 2,297 2,201 27 The total number of accidents involving personal injury fell by 71, but the lumber of adults killed increased by 1 and the number of seriously injured adults by 8. The number of adults slightly injured decreased by 118. With regard to children, compared with 1960 the number killed fell from 3 to 1 and the number of seriously injured from 59 to 58 but the figure for slightly injured rose from 276 to 292. The comhined totals lor all types of casualties, adults and children, fell from 2,297 in 1960 to 2,201 this year. Although it might be said that the picture for 1961 is better than that for 1960, the situation with regard to road casualties is still alarming. 29 SECTION B PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The undermentioned diseases are compulsorily notifiable within the Borough of Lambeth.

This increase was due entirely to an outbreak of measles, 3,462 cases being notified compared with 542 the previous year. This was to be expected as measles tends to occur in epidemic form every two years and the year 1959 was an "epidemic year". Poliomy elttis Two cases only were notified during the year both of the paralytic type. Both were children, a boy aged 1 year and a girl aged 2 years. This was a reduction of five on the figure for 1960 when 4 paralytic and 3 non-paralytic cases were notified and a reduction of 14 on the figure for 1959 when sixteen cases (8 paralytic and 8 non-paralytic) occurred. Scabies Twenty-three people, 6 more than in I960, were treated for scabies. The arrangements with the Metropolitan Boroughs of Southwark and Battersea for the cleansing of such persons continued throughout the year. Scarlet Fever There was an increase in the number of cases notified, 115 cases occurring compared with 97 in 1960. Whooping cough This disease showed a decrease on the 1960 figure, 119 cases being notified compared with 361 last year. Pneumonia There was an increase of 18 in the number of cases notified, 63 compared with 45 in 1960 Dysentery The number of notifications fell considerably, 127 cases being notified compared with 361 in I960. 34 As in 1960 approximately two thirds of the cases occurred in the Vauxhall Parliamentary Constituency, 28 of the cases occurred in the Brixton Constituency and 18 in Norwood. The cases were spread throughout the year as follows. First Quarter 26 Second Quarter 37 Third Quarter 26 Fourth Quarter 38 127 Food Poisoning Sixteen cases of food poisoning were notified compared with fifty-four in 1960. The cases were distributed throughout the year as follows F irst quarter 4 Second quarter 5 Third quarter 7 Fourth quarter 16 They were single cases spread throughout the Borough and there were no outbreaks of food poisoning. The agent was identified in 7 cases. Salmonella enteritidis 3 Salmonella Typhimurium 4 In the remaining nine cases the agent was not identified. Typhoid Fever Two cases of typhoid fever were notified during the year. Both of the victims had been abroad before the onset of the disease and it is reasonable to suppose that they had acquired the disease there. 35 The first was a boy of 14 years who had been on an exchange visit to France and was taken ill just before he returned to this Country. The second was a girl of 11 years who had spent September at a farm in Southern Italy and upon her return on the 2nd October felt unwell. Enquiries showed that water on the farm was obtained from a well which was fairly close to a privy. 36 BOROUGH OF LAMBETH IMMUNISATION - 1961 Completed Cases Welfare Centres and Nurseries General Practitioners Totals Under 5 years 5- 14 years Under 5 years 5- 14 years Diphtheria Prophylaxis only 122 474 33 62 691 Combined Antigen Diphtheria and Whooping Cough 3 — 27 11 41 Triple Antigen Diphtheria, Whooping Cough and Tetanus 3164 82 1031 134 4411 Diphtheria and Tetanus 96 342 10 30 478 Diphtheria - boosting doses - all ages 3903 1316 5219 Whooping Cough only all ages (completed cases) 2 10 12 37 Diphtheria immunisation is the responsibility of the London County Council, but may also be carried out by general practitioners and I am indebted to Dr. W.H.S. Wallace, Divisional Medical Officer of Division 8 for supplying me with the above figures. INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION International Certificates of vaccination for persons travelling to certain countries abroad are required in respect of Smallpox, Yellow Fever and Cholera. Vaccination against any disease other than yellow fever can be done by a Person's own doctor, or exceptionally (by arrangement) at a hospital. So long as vaccination is done under the National Health Service, whether by a person's own doctor or at a hospital, no charge may be made for it, but in either case the doctor may charge for issuing an International Certificate. Yellow fever vaccination must, for international and technical reasons, be done only at a Centre designated by the Government, in London the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, 4, St Pancras Way, N.W.I., Medical Department, Unilever House, Blackfriars, E.C.4., and West London Designated Vaccinating Centre, 53, Great Cumberland Place, W.l. An International Certificate of vaccination against yellow fever will be supplied, after vaccination, at the Centre at which the vaccination is done. The International Certificates for smallpox and cholera (for completion by the person's own doctor) must be obtained by the traveller himself and taken to the doctor, it is NOT for the Doctor, or a Local Authority, or their Medical Officer of Health, to supply them. The forms can usually be obtained by the traveller from the Company arranging his transport, or he can get them from the Ministry of Health, Saville Row, London, W.l. After completion by the vaccinator, certificates must be franked with an approved stamp. Approved stamps have been prescribed for the United Kingdom. If the accinator is not himself an authorised user of a stamp, the person vaccinated must take or send the certificate for stamping to a Local Authority. In England and Wales this is the Town Hall, Urban District Council or Kural District in whose area the vaccinator practices. It should be noted that this is not necessarily the area in which the person vaccinated lives. During the year, 1742 International Certificates of Vaccination were stamped y the Public Health Department. 38 TUBERCULOSIS Notification The following table shows the number of cases of tuberculosis notified tor the first time during the year 1961 excluding transfers into the district and cases brought to notice other than by formal notification.

Table 1 refers to the work of the Chest Clinic at St Francis' Hospital and is an extract of the- Annual Return of Chest Clinic work sent to the Ministry Health for the year 1961.

In 3 cases the disease was diagnosed after deaf Of the remainder a large percentage had cardiac and vascular disease as a contributory cause of death. Of the female deaths 4 were in the older age groups, over 50, and the 2 others were between 30 and 40 years of age and had had the disease for many years and had contracted the infection before the use of chemotherapy. 43 The death rate continues, as will be seen, to affect in the main the older male age groups. The 2 non-respiratory deaths on the Table refer to infants dying of generalised tuberculosis including meningitis contracted by contact infection outside the family. Neither had had B.C.G. vaccination. Non - Respiratory Tuberculosis The 4 cases were diagnosed in outside hospitals and were all secondary to Primary infection in the lungs. No case of bovine tuberculosis was recorded. Respiratory Tuberculosis With a total of 77 new cases diagnosed during the year the decrease in Annual incidence is resumed but nevertheless confirms the presence of persistent, infection in the borough and the need for sustained effort in the struggle to eradicate tuberculous disease. A minimal number of children, 5 only, were found suffering from respiratory infection and all had a significant contact history. Examination of home contacts and vaccination with B.C.G. of those found suitable is an essential aspect of the Chest Clinic service and ultimate prevention of tuberculous disease in children is to be anticipated. Again among adults twice as many males as females contracted the disease in the majority of all cases it proved impossible to trace the original source infection. The hidden and unknown infector pool of ambulant infectious cases must to a large extent be held responsible.

These cases when positive probably constitute the infector pool during life and account for the present 5% incidence of drug resistant infection occurring among new cases diagnosed. The use of long term chemotherapy on cases at home and whilst at work however considerably reduces the number of infector cases in the population and may well be responsible for the fall in new cases this year, the lowest on record. This applies also to the total number of cases on the Clinic Registers but this still represents practically 1% of the community needing Chest Clinic supervision and advice. Treatment New cases are in the very great majority diagnosed by chest X-ray examination at a Chest Clinic, hospital or Mass Radiography Unit and a high percentage are in the earlist stage of the disease susceptible to modern chemotherapy. Most new cases needing active treatment are first admitted to a chest hospital for initiation of chemotherapy which is subsequently continued as an out-patient under Chest Clinic supervision. There were 29 such admissions during the year. Out-patient chemotherapy is usually maintained on a long term basis the course lasting 2 years and there were 219 such cases under treatment during 1961. The need for re-admission to hospital occurred only in cases suffering from old standing chronic disease and none occurred in any case diagnosed during the previous 2 years. The Chest Clinic was well attended and there were 3,709 patient attendances. The London County Council Tuberculosis Health Visitors paid 3,100 visits to patients homes and during the year 88 patients received extra milk, butter and eggs provided by the Council. 45 SECTION C GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA Care of the Aged Work in connection with the aged has continued to expand and the number of visits made by the Woman Public Health Visitor increased by 377; a total of 3099 visits were made compared with 2722 last year. During the year 524 new cases were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department, an increase of 50 over the number of new cases for 1960. One hundred and forty-six old people were persuaded to enter hospitals and institutions voluntarily, 9 were removed by the Mental Welfare Officer, and one was dealt with under the National Assistance Act 1948 as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951. A total of 493 persons received help in some form or another, in 26 cases no help was required and in 6 instances help was refused. The number of cases on the register, including those from previous years is 1.865. The age groups into which the 524 new cases were divided are as follows:- Male Female Totals 60 - 69 years 41 82 123 70 - 74 years 29 55 84 75 - 79 years 38 77 115 80 - 84 years 32 76 108 85 - 89 years 16 56 72 90 - 94 years 3 16 19 95 years and over 1 2 3 160 364 524 Considerable work has been done in connection with old people by various m embers of my staff, and this I acknowledge. The co-operation of Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association, The London County Council through its Domestic Help and Nursing Services, the Geriatricians the Hospitals has continued throughout the year. These organisations have helped, once more, to make the task of the Public Health Department less difficult to them my thanks are due. 46 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT 1948 SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT 1951 Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 deals with securing the necessary care and attention for persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions, and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. This Act enables a Local Authority, on the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, to apply to a Court for an Order to remove a person in need of care and attention to a home or hospital for a period of up to three months. Before granting the Order, the Court must be satisfied that certain conditions laid down in the Act are met. Action under the main Act may be protracted, therefore the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951, was passed enabling the Medical Officer of Health, under delegated powers to apply to the Court himself in an emergency. If the amending legislation is used, a second medical certificate is required and the maximum period of detention is three weeks During the year under review action was taken under the amended legislation one case. Details of this case are set out below :- This was an old lady of 81 years of age. The case was referred to the Public Health Department by the Inspector of the R.S.P.C.A. who was concerned about a dog. He called »t the office on 15th March, 1961. Apparently on 13th March neighbours became concerned because they had not seen the old lady for some days, groceries and milk were on the doorstep. They got in touch with the Police who gained entrance to the house through a back window. The old lady was ill, the house dirty and there was animal excreta in the house. The Police arranged for an ambulance and a bed and the old lady was taken to hospital where she refused to stay. 47 The Public Health Visitor went to the house with the R.S.P.C.A. Inspector but there was no reply. A letter was written to a relative and arrangements were made to visit on 17th March. The old lady was in bed naked and bedding was on the floor. She was extremely cold and weak. The house was in a filthy condition. The Medical Officer of Health saw her and got in touch with her doctor and the geriatrician who visited later in the day. The old lady refused to go into hospital, it became necessary to enforce removal and she was removed to hospital at 7.30 p.m. where she died on 23rd March, Laundry Service for Aged Incontinent Persons The arrangements made with the Southwark Borough Council for carrying out this service continued during the year. Before the service is granted each case is visited by the lady visitor to ascertain whether it may be dealt with in accordance with Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act 1936 and collection and deliveries are made twice weekly. The total number of persons receiving benefit from the scheme during the year was 154(140), the total visits made were 3,125 (2,152) and the total number of soiled articles collected and taken to Southwark Cleansing Station was 29,159 20,421). The total weight of the laundry cleansed was 26,163 lb (19,137 lb). The figures given in brackets are those for the year 1960. Home Bathing Scheme An increasing number of aged persons are benefiting from this service and during the year 2,140 baths were given. This is an increase of 349 over the figure for 1961. Holidays For The Elderly The scheme to send old age pensioners to the sea for a weeks holiday at the cost of £1 each was continued during the year. In order to participate in the scheme a person must be an old age pensioner, have lived in the Borough of Lambeth for at least three years and during the same Pefiod must not have had a holiday. The holiday scheme proceeded smoothly and during each of four weeks in May 1961 parties of old folk totalling 215 were taken to Margate and in September 58 old people went on holiday. Details are given in the accompanying tables. His Worship the Mayor and the Chairman of the Public Health Committee Saw some of the parties off, and this was much appreciated. Many letters of appreciation and verbal thanks have been received.

Chairman and Members of the Executive Committee of the Lambeth Old People's Welfare Association for allowing me to include the following report on the activities of the Association. It should be noted that the Association's year covers the period from 1st April, 1961 to 31st March, 1962 and therefore does not co-incide strictly with the Petiod covered by my Annual Report. REPORT OF ASSOCIATION The success of an old people's welfare organisation must be judged not only by its service but by whether these are known to, and used by, those who need help. It is, therefore, encouraging to be able to report that during the year under review 1,885 new people became known to the Association of whom 566 called at the office for help or advice. At the same time further contact was made with 4,986 people already known to the Association, a considerably larger number than in the previous year. The problems to be dealt with appear unlimited and range from simple tasks like witnessing a signature or helping to fill in a census form to negotiating with a landlord to prevent an eviction or trying to persuade somebody to take a more positive attitude towards their problems. It is most important that help be sought before situations have developed beyond solution and this will only happen if the work of the Association is widely known and trusted. Visiting Establishing personal contact with old people is one of the best ways of advertising the work of the Association and making sure that those who need help will know where to turn. It is always a source of great encouragement to hear a caller at the office say "the lady who called to see me sometime ago said that if I was ever in difficulty I should come here". Asking for help from a Person one has met or who has been recommended by a friend or neighbour is easier than approaching an impersonal organisation. The Executive Committee's decision to appoint a part time clerk typist in the office will enable other members of the staff to spend more time on visiting. Another equally important aspect of visiting is that done by voluntary Workers who "adopt" lonely old people and visit them regularly. One or two hours a week used in this way can give satisfaction and pleasure to giver and receiver quite out of proportion to the time spent. The Association cannot adequately express its gratitude to all the people who do this work, and a special Word of thanks must be given to those individuals who during this year have for the first time offered the Association their services. 50 Meals - on - Wheels Duringthe year under review 27,590 meals were delivered by the Association in the Northern part of the Borough: 22,088 to people in their own homes and 5,502 to lunch clubs. The Southern part of the Borough was served by the Women's Voluntary Service which delivered 24,094 meals, all to people in their own homes. Taking the Borough as a whole the largest number of people served on any one day was 305, of which 64 were at lunch clubs. These were at Northcote House Senior Club: St Anne's Settlement, during the winter months; a small new club at Christ Church (Oxford) United Clubs; and at the Work Centre until its transfer to the new building. Throughout the year the Association's three vans have been working to almost full capacity. The drivers and escorts, who have been all employed by the Association for at least one year and some for much longer, continued to give the old people a helping hand in minor domestic upsets, and informed the office whenever more serious problems arose. There is no doubt that their devoted work adds to the value of this important service. The only change during the year was in January when the price per meal paid to the Caterers was increased to 2/- to cover rising costs and also to improve quantity, quality and variety. At the same time the L.C.C. increased its grant per meal to 1/- and the old people's payment was increased to 1/-. The improvement in the meals was immediately noticed by the old people many of whom said that it was well worth the extra 2d. However, it has been an important year for planning and it is with great pleasure that the Association can report that from 2nd April deliveries throughout the Borough were increased from four to five days per week. At the same time the Association extended its area to Brixton taking over a full round of deliveries from the W.V.S. which necessitated the purchase of a fourth van. Chiropody The six clinics have continued to provide 27 sessions per week and there have been 7 sessions per week of domiciliary treatment. At least 2,500 people have benefited from the service, but throughout the year it has been necessary to keep waiting lists to prevent the waiting time between appointments becoming too long. It has been a disappointing year for the Association with respect to this service. Every effort has been made to get the L.C.C. to permit expansion, but without success. It appears that although the need for expansion is recognised the L.C.C. is not satisfied that there are sufficient properly qualified chiropodists available, and takes the view that with its large trained staff it is in a better position to supervise and control a chiropody service than are voluntary Associations, It can, therefore, only be hoped that it will not be too long before the L.C.Cwill expand its own clinics to cope with the growing demand for treatment from elderly Lambethans. 51 The smooth and happy functioning of the clinics would be impossible without the co-operation of the Chiropodists, who often have to work under difficult conditions but are always ready to give a sympathetic ear to an elderly patient's Problems as well as attend to their feet The Association is glad therefore to take this opportunity to express its appreciation. And last, but far from least, the Association wishes to express its deep gratitude to the voluntary receptionists who give up their time so generously to help at the clinics. Holidays A surprisingly large number of elderly people will not consider the idea of leaving their homes even for a week's holiday. However for those who feel the need for a change of air and surroundings the Association is able to arrange two Weeks summer holiday under the auspices of the Women's Holiday Fund and this year 45 women saved with the Association towards this type of holiday. Elderly People of limited means who have lived in the Borough for at least three years and have not had a holiday in that time can apply to go away under the Borough holiday Scheme. This year 215 people in May and 158 in September had a week's holiuday in Margate. Contributions were also made towards holidays arranged for Seven infirm people. For those who wish to arrange their own holidays the Association keeps tails of organisations and individuals who offer reduced rates for pensioners or Qther special arrangements for them. The Association wishes to thank the omen's Holiday Fund and other similar organisations whose co-operation is valuable in this aspect of its work. Lambeth Centre for the Elderly, 69-73 Knowle Road, S.W.9. It is with great pleasure that the Association reports the completion of this Centre and wishes to thank all those who helped to make this long awaited Project possible. The first floor, to be used as a Rest Room, comprises a large lounge, a dining cum games room and a small kitchen. It will be open five days a week kowingto its limited capacity, during a trial period to assess demand, attendance by any individual will be restricted and preference will be given to people who do not belong to clubs. The ground floor of the building is occupied by the Work Centre, and its Organiser will also be responsible for the day to day administration of the Rest Room with the help of a new part-time assistant, and voluntary workers. Work Centre It has been a year of marking time in anticipation of the move to the new 52 building. It was originally hoped that it would be ready for occupation in November but as a result of delays due to bad weather and shortages of building materials the move was made a week before the end of the year under review. The Centre, therefore, faces a new year with the hope of great expansion in terms of members and contracts for work. The minibus purchased by the Association in February will help to further this aim. During the year the number of people attending the Centre varied from 41 to 45. Two people left on finding part-time jobs. The contracts for sewing button cards and darning hose, and the sorting of tin foil have continued throughout the year. Two new activities were price tag assembly and putting literature in envelopes for a mail order firm. The latter contract involved collection and delivery of materials but was one of the best paid jobs under undertaken by the Centre. The move to the new Centre, which was accompanied by the closing of the small subsidiary Centre at Orsett Street, Kennington, resulted in the membership being reduced to 36. The new building was accepted with unreserved enthusiasm by the members despite the fact that many of them now have to travel by bus to the Centre. Special Activities A Jumble Sale held on a Saturday afternoon in May at the Civil Defence Hall Brixton was a most successful occasion thanks to the generosity of the Lambeth Borough Council in letting the hall at a small rent, and the help of the members, friends and staff of the Association who gave so generously of their time and energy. A net amount of £53 was raised. Inter-Borough Talent Contest. As in previous years the Association took part in this annual event, and held its own preliminary contest to select the Lambeth representative. For the 1961 Contest the Executive Committee decided to pay for a coach to take a group of people to the final Contest which is held at St Pancras Town Hall. All performers in the Lambeth heats were offered seats in the coach and the remainder were offered to the winner's club. The Annual Church Service was held in May at St. Matthew's Church Brixton and was attended by the Mayor, Mayoress and Town Clerk. The weather was poor and the congregation was rather small. Lambeth Festival 17th-25th June. A United Services coach loaned to the Association for the occasion took part in the Carnival procession and was occupied by forty club members and leaders representing eleven different clubs. A new meals-on-wheels van also took part in the procession. Included in a Welfare Exhibition in the Town Hall was a full display of the Association's services which aroused considerable interest. 53 An Outing to Hedgerly, Bucks was arranged in June for older more infirm people Who do not belong to clubs. To many of the people who went it was a new and Wonderful experience. The occasion was made possible by the generosity of the Hedgerley Women's Institute who provided tea and entertainment, and Brixton Rotarians who paid for the coach. Annual Inter'Club Competition and Exhibition of Work was held in October. A total of 498 entries were received for the Competition, plus a selection of articles from the King George VI Club which were for display only. All the Judges commented on the very high standard of the exhibits and their difficulty In deciding on the winners. Sixteen different clubs were represented among the Prize winners and the Competition Shield was won by the Ruskin Club. For the first time the Woman's Own Magazine gave the Association two bronze medals and three diplomas. Three of these awards entitled the winners to take part in the Roman's Own National Handicraft Competition. Christmas Concert by Old People for Old People was held at the end of November. The entertainment was provided by 18 people representing seven different clubs. This year the event was particularly successful because of the lively compering of Mr. Councillor Dave Walker. christmas Gift Distribution. The Association itself does not normally give Parcels except to people in receipt of meals-on-wheels who also received an extra turkey dinner on Christmas Eve. It has, however, become the practice for the office to check lists for other organisations both to report removals, deaths and changes of address, and to try to ensure that the gifts available are spread as widely as possible. The Association also provides the names and addresses of needy people to organisations, firms, schools and individuals who want to distribute gifts: in some cases it helped with the actual distribution. The names those with whom the Association co-operated in this way are given at the end of this report. Clubs The 30 clubs in the Borough represented on the Association continued to Carry on their important work. For many elderly people the visit to the club is the highlight of the week. Every effort is made to encourage lonely people to join a club and Leaders have co-operated by arranging for new people to be Collected by a member on their first visit to the club. During the year under review three of the clubs lost their leaders but in each case it was possible to rally help to cany on the work. There were two Club Leaders' meetings to discuss various projects being organised by the Association. Five clubs applied for grants towards rent etc., one for a grant Wards an outing, and seven for a new grant of up to £5 for Entertainers introduced for the first time this year. 54 Besides the excellent work done week by week in the clubs the Leaders and Helpers provide the backbone of voluntary helpers whenever the Association organises any sort of function. Their unfailing loyalty and helpfulness can easily be taken for granted and it is, therefore, the more important that every year in this report a public statement of gratitude should be recorded. King George VI Memorial Club (Camberwell and Lambeth) Members of this special daily club for the infirm each attend one day a week, and at any one time the membership is about 300: during the year under review there was a total of 11,367 attendances; 89 new people joined and 103 ceased to be members mainly due to deaths. There were 172 applications for membership, including six from people who were ineligible because they live outside the two Boroughs which help to finance the club. At the end of the year 86 of these applications could not yet be considered; the approximate waiting time for admission is six months. During the summer each Club day had three outings, and at Christmas there was a party for each day. Holidays were arranged for many members with help from the two Old People's Welfare Associations and the L.C.C. Welfare Department. In the late Summer a newly installed shower was ready for use by the members. It is so constructed that the person taking a shower can sit down and thermostatically controlled water flows from shower arms on each side. This has proved to be a useful and much appreciated addition to the Club facilities Also at the end of the year the club appointed its own bathing orderly. Acknowledgements Throughout the year the work of the Association is furthered by the support of many organisations and individuals some of whom are mentioned in the Report and others in the list of Donations. In addition acknowledgment and thanks must be given to the following. The Lambeth Borough Council whose generous, unfailing financial help is the comer stone of the work for the elderly in the Borough; and its Medical Officer of Health and other staff who are always ready to give help and advice.

PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES It is the duty of the Local Health Authority, in the case of the Borough of Lambeth, the London County Council, either to provide these services or arrange for their provision by some other organisation. The County Council does in fact administer the maternity and child welfare services, the vaccination and immunisation, health visiting and domestic help services from the Divisional Health Offices, 2, Walworth Road, S.E.1. Vaccination and immunisation is also done by general practitioners. The Midwifery, ambulance and mental health services are administered direct from the Public Health Department, County Hall, S.E.1. and home nursing is carried out on behalf of the County Council by voluntary organisations. The voluntary nursing associations working in the Borough are as follows:- Brixton District Nursing Association Camberwell District Nursing Association Norwood & District Nursing Association Ranyard Nurses Roman Catholic Nurses' Institute South London District Nursing Association Southwark, Newington and Walworth District Nursing Associations 57 PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a comprehensive service for examination of specimens submitted by local authorities and general practitioners. The local Laboratory is situated at County Hall and is under the Section of Dr. A.J.H. Tomlinson. 58 SECTION D SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply I am indebted to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board for the following report on the water supplied to the Borough. The supply to the Borough of Lambeth has been satisfactory both in quantity and quality during the year 1961. "There were no new important extensions of trunk mains nor any changes in the general scheme of supply to your area during 1961 but the length of new mains laid amounted to 2,737 yards. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to service and samples of water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure that its quality is up to that normally supplied." The number of samples taken during the year from the Thames Valley Southern Group for chemical examination was 156 and the number taken for bacteriological examination 1835. The average results were as follows:- Chemical Examination Milligrams per litre (unless Description of sample otherwise stated) Thames derived filtered water Ammonia nitrogen 0.041 Albuminoid nitrogen 0.076 Oxidised nitrogen-nitrate 4.1 Chlorides as C1 27.0 Oxygen abs. from Permanganate 4 hours at 27°C 1.06 Turbidity units 0.2 Colour m.m. brown 2 ft. tube Burgess's Tintometer 13.0 Hardness (total) 262 Hardness (non- carbonate) 52.0 pH value 7.9 Phosphate as P04 1.0 59 Description of sample Milligrams per litre (unless otherwise stated) Silicate as SiO 9.0 2 Sulphate as SO4 50.0 Fluoride as F 0.20 Magnesium as Mg 6.0 Surface Active material as Manoxol 0.11 Electrical Conductivity (Gemmhos) 525.0 Bacteriological Examination after Chlorinatlon (Water passing into supply after treatment) Plate counts (average per ml.) Colonies counted on agar 37°C (20-24 hours) 10.0 Coliform count percentage samples negative in 100 ml 99.84 E. coli count percentage samples negative in 100 ml 99.89 Water from Wells There are a number of wells in use, the majority of which however, supply water used only for industrial purposes. The water from two wells is used for drinking purposes, or for the preparation of food. Reports of the analyses of water from these two wells are received regularly and have been satisfactory for the year under review. In addition two samples were submitted to the Public Analyst, one for chemical analysis and one for bacteriological examination both of which were satisfactory. Sewers 1 am indebted to the Borough Engineer for supplying me with the following information with regard to sewers within the Borough. "There are 142 miles of highways in the Borough of Lambeth in which are laid sewers varying in size from 6" diameter to 4' 6" x 2' 8" wide and maintained by the Council's Direct Labour Staff. These sewers and gully connections need regular maintenance and in several cases reconstruction. The Council's expenditure on such work is at the rate of £20,000 approximately for maintenance and £27,000 approximately for reconstruction per annum. During the past twelve months the sewers in the following list of streets have been relaid. 60 Thotpach Road Crimsworth Road Goldsboro Road Idmiston Road This work of reconstruction of sewers will help substantially in the elini* nation of flooding and rat infestation in such streets".

The usual offenders were wood boring beetles, ants, cockroaches, drugstore beetles, carpet beetles, clothes moths, weevils and silver fish. The total number of visits made by the staff of the Disinfecting Station for all purposes was 2,497. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Rodent destruction in dwelling houses and business premises is carried out under the direction of the Rodent Officer, an Assistant Rodent Officer and a Rodent operative working under his supervision. Sewer treatment is carried out by the department of the Borough Engineer in conjunction with the Rodent Officer and his staff. 65 In all cases of dwelling houses treatment is undertaken by the Local Authority free of charge, but in the case of business premises a charge is made. During the year 1,251 complaints were received. Of this number 122 were not Justified; 864 were in respect of brown rats, and 165 in respect of mice. During course of investigation 1,136 baitings were made and 73 defective drains discovered. 18 Statutory Notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, and 11 under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949.

Improvement Grants The number of applications received for Discretionary Grants is still low. This is mainly due to the comparatively high standard of fitness required as the Premises must provide satisfactory housing for thirty years. Further obstacles are the restrictions imposed on rents and the necessity for the accommodation to be self-contained. Standard Grants, which were introduced under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, cover half the cost, up to a maximum of £155, of installing five basic improvements - a bath or shower, a wash-hand basin, a water closet, a hot water system and a food store. Grants may be made for all or some of these improvements and the conditions imposed are less rigorous than those for Discretionary Grants.

These provide data of local interest and are maintained on a month to month basis. In the atmospheric pollution stations all fine suspended solid particles in a measured volume of air in the vicinity of each station are trapped by a "Whatman" filter paper, forming a "smoke stain" thereon. The degree of light reflected from this stain is compared with that from an unstained filter paper and the result computed in micrograms (of suspended matter) per CUBIC metre (of air). In the same apparatus and at the same time gaseous pollutants, mainly sulphur dioxide, are chemically separated by being bubbled through a neutral dilution of hydrogen peroxide. The resultant mixture, actually sulphuric acid, is tested by the smoke inspectors for degrees of acidity and the result computed into micrograms (of sulphur dioxide) per CUBIC metre (of air). In the other 4 stations mentioned, solid particles brought down by rain or otherwise falling on the Standard Deposit Guages are determined by chemical analysis, while the lead dioxide candles are sulphated by attack from sulphurous gases in the atmosphere and the degree of sulphation measured by analysis. Results are expressed as milligrams (of undisolved deposit) per SQUARE metre per day and also in tons per square mile and milligrams (of SO3) absorbed per day per 100 SQUARE centimetres, respectively. It will be noted that the first mentioned results are volumetric, while the second method refers to superficial deposit. A few interesting facts appear to emerge from the information collected Really (i)The area surrounding station No. 11 (Kennington Secondary School, Hackford Road) consists of Smoke Control Area No. 1 and records show that, so far as atmospheric pollution by smoke is concerned, it compares equally, if not favourably, with the areas surrounding Norwood Technical College and Heme Hill Library (Stations Nos. 12 and 13). 76 (ii) While pollution by smoke ( i.e. solid particles) appears to have decreased in the No. 1 Smoke Control Area, the incidence of Sulphur Dioxide (gaseous pollutant)there, is, unfortunately, as high as ever. (iii) Pollution figures obtained from the Tate Library in South Lambeth Road (Station No. 10) bear very little comparison with those from other stations in comparable wind, weather and temperature conditions, but appear to be entirely dominated by pollution from road traffic congregating at the adjacent light controlled road junction. (iv) Pollution figures at Heme Hill Library (Station No. 13) compare favourably with those at Norwood Technical College (Station No. 12) except when the wind is in the South East Quarter when, apparently, the railway sidings at Heme Hill B.R. Station exert an influence. (v) Continous periods of sunny weather, especially when winds are slight, are no indication that atmospheric pollution figures will be low. Possibly due to the increase of "pleasure motoring", at such times, pollution figures are often disturbingly high. A period of settled rain, however, presages very satisfactory conditions so far as the pollution stations are concerned. 77 1961 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION SOLID DEPOSITS AND SULPHUR DIOXIDE SIPERFICAL MEASUREMENT MONTH Rainfall in mm Deposited Matter in Tons per Square Mile SO2 in mgs. per Day on 100 Sq. cms.

Details of the work carried out during the year are set out under the several heads which follow. bacteriological and other Examinations The following samples were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for bacteriological examination. Articles marked with an asterisk were suspected having caused food poisoning. Organisms likely to be responsible were found only in one sample. 92 Ice Cream and Ice Cream Mix 125 Ice Lollies 6 Whole dried egg 16 Spray Dried Egg Albumen 11 Canned Salmon 1 Frozen Confectionery 1 Cooked Pork 1 Boiled Salt Beef 1 Liquorex cooked meat boiler 1 Brine ex Brine Bath 1 Pease Pudding 3 Savaloy 1 Meat 1 Prawns 11 Clostridium Welchii present. No organisms isolated. Samples of milk were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, as follows Methylene Blue Tests 217 ( 4 were void, the atmospheric shade temperature being over 65ºF), and 1 failed to satisfy the prescribed test Phosphatase Tests 221 All samples were satisfactory. The 125 samples of ice-cream and ice-cream mix were submitted to the Methylene Blue Test of which 12,10%, were graded in provisional grades 3 and 4 as against 13% during 1960. Generally these results show improved methylene blue gradings compared with the last two years. Plate counts were undertaken in respect of all samples which fell into provisipnal grades 2, 3 and 4 and these ranged from less than 100 colonies per millilitre to more than 10,000 per millilitre. In 5 cases the plates were overgrown with bacillus cereus. The renewal of particular parts of the equipment in one factory referred to in my previous annual report was completed during the winter season and this must have contributed to a better standard of plant hygiene. Nevertheless, the results of examinations of samples taken from this plant still did not give methylene blue gradings comparable with other plants although comparatively low plate counts were maintained. This was true also of 3 out of 4 samples taken direct from the pasteurising vat before the mix had come into contact with the homogeniser, cooling, ageing and freezing equipment and tends to support the view that relatively few aerobic spore-bearing organisms such as bacillus cereus will accelerate the reduction of methylene blue dye. 93 INSPECTION OF FOOD Inspection at Shops, Stores, Factories and Wharf Large quantities of food of all varieties were inspected and as a result the following food was surrendered as unfit for human consumption and unsound food certificates were issued.

As a result one prosecution was instituted in the undermentioned case, the summons being returnable in 1962. 48 Bread - mouldy Milk - contained comb; complaint No. 38 reported in the Annual Report for the year I960 page 105, the result of the legal proceedings is as follows > The defendant pleaded guilty, a fine of €5.0.0. was imposed and the defendant ordered to pay £2. 0. 0. costs. In all other cases, the majority of which were first complaints, the attention of the persons responsible was called to the nature of the complaint and to theii liabilities. In most cases where foreign bodies were found in food, there is little doubt that they were introduced at some stage during its processing rather than its distribution. Many of these foods were prepared outside the Borough, and a few overseas. In such cases the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned, or, where approprate, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, was informed. Street Markets Markets are held in The Cut, Lower Marsh, Lambeth Walk and Wilcox Road in the Inner Wards, and in Popes Road, Electric Avenue and Brixton Station Road. All these are inspected regularly. Slaughter of Animals Act No application was made during the year for the issue of a licenceunder the Provisions of this Act. 98 SECTION F GENERAL Public Swimming Bath I am indebted to the Scientific Adviser of the London County Council for the following report on the London County Council Swimming Bath situated in Brock well Park. The bath, of 750,000 gallons capacity, is filled with Metropolitan Water Board mains water. The bath is treated by continuous filtration with pressure type sand filters, together with break-point chlorination, alum and soda dosing and aeration. The time of circulation is 5 hours and the bath is normally emptied once per year. The results obtained from the bacteriological examinations during 1961 were as follows Standards Agar Count 1 ml. 37°C. 48 hours. Presumptive coliform pollution without faecal Faecal coliform pollution 0-10 11-100 Over 100 No. of samples 5 2 2 2 0 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Section 50 - Burials Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act 1948, the Lambeth Borough Council is required to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in its area if in such cases it appears to the Council that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body have been or are ??? made. During the year 30 funerals were arranged involving 20 males and 10 females The amount paid to funeral contractors was £354. 8. 0. The sum of £261.5.6 was recovered by way of grants, insurance policies and money found. 99 The actual cost to the Council was therefore £93. 2. 6. L4ND CHARGES ACT 1925 During the year 3,048 enquiries were received and dealt with in respect of searches under the above mentioned Act. PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT 1933 The number of persons entered or retained on the list under the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 (Section 2l)Part II was 145. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 Twenty Three samples of various filling materials were submitted to a Prescribed analyst for examination. One, of cotton felt, was reported as containing above the permitted maximum percentage of trash content. The balance of the consignment was withdrawn and a further sample taken from a later consignment of new cotton felt supplied from the same mills was satisfactory. Seven premises are registered under this Act. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act provides that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A local authority may, on application, grant to a person who is not for the time being disqualified from keeping a pet shop a licence to keep a pet shop at such premises in their area as may be specified in the application, and subject to compliance with such conditions as may be specified in the licence. In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a pet shop, a local authority shall in particular have regard to the need for securing :- (a) That animals will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects size, temperature, lighting, ventilation and clealiness; (b) that animals will be adequatily supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals. (c) that animals, being mammals, will not be sold at too early an age; 100 (d) that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases; (e) that appropriate steps will be taken in case of fire or other emergency. During the year 15 licences were issued under the Act No. of Inspections - 20 No. of re-visits - 2 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1954 Hairdressers and Barbers On 6th July, 1955 the Lambeth Borough Council made bye-laws in respect hairdressers and barbers under the above mentioned Act. The total number of premises on the register at the end of the year was as follows :- Premises 218 Number of inspections 119 Number of re-visits 46 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT 1959 Control of Movable Dwellings Section 22 of the above .mentioned Act covers the control of caravan sites and came into operation on the 1st October, 1960. The Council adopted the standards drawn up by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee and the recommendations made by the London County Council in relation to:- (i) Density (ii) Water Supply (iii) Sanitary Accommodation (iv) Disposal of Waste (v) Fire fighting equipment (vi) Footways and Hard Standing.
