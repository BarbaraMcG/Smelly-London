Thirteenth Annual Report, presented pursuant to 198 sec. of the Metropolitan Local Management Act, 1855. The Board of Works for the Fulham District, solicit attention to the following documents herewith presented. An abstract of the several contracts entered into by the Board; an abstract of assets and liabilities, and an abstract of receipts and expenditure for the year ending 25th March, 1869. The Board has caused to be removed nuisance cases as follows:— Privies and Cesspools 191 Drains and Gullies cleansed and repaired 570 Houses do. do do. 221 Swine nuisances removed 274 Miscellaneous 88 Total 1344 Houses benefited in Fulham 609 Houses „ Hammersmith 523 Total 1202 The Board has during the past year negociated a loan of £10,206 with the Imperial Life Assurance Company, for the purchase of the wharf and for the completion of certain works of sewering; an abstract of the mortgages thereon are herewith presented. 6 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REP4ORT. The Board have, during the year, constructed permanent works as follows. In Fulham— London Road—from Walham Green to High Street, a brick sewer 4-ft. 6-in. by 2-ft. 2-in. Crown Road—from North End road to the corner of Church road, a brick sewer 4-ft. 6-in. by 2-ft. 9-in., with the necessary gullies for surface drainage. King's Road—Channelling. London Road, part of—Channelling. Market Place—channelling. Wellington Road a brick sewer. St. Thomas' Road—a 12-in pipe sewer. New Grove Road—a 12-in. pipe sewer. In Hammersmith— Farm Lane—a brick sewer 4-ft. 6-in., by 2-ft. 9 -in. Denmark Road—a 12-in. pipe fewer, the carriageway properly formed, and the paths paved. St. Peter's Road—paved, curbed, and the carriageway properly made. Cambridge Road—paved and curbed, and the carriageway properly formed. Latyiner Road, north end of—the road and path properly made and path curbed. Latymer Road, south end of—the same. The Board during the past year having had under their consideration the advisability of employing their own artisans and labourers for the performance of the jobbing works of paving, bricklaying, &c., in the district, have resolved to do such works in future by their own men, and hope to be enabled to report to the inhabitants at the close of another year that they have effected a saving to the ratepayers thereby, not only in money but also in the superior character of the work performed. The Board having had brought under their notice a complaint as to the manner in which the works of the London Road sewer were being conducted, instituted a thorough enquiry into the matter of complaint, and appointed two London Surveyors to examine and report on the general character of the Avork. The said surveyors met, examined and presented a report, accompanied by a bill of deductions amounting to £302 10s. 6d for works not carried out strictly in accordance Avith the specification and contract, but stating at the same time that the Avork was fully equal and sufficient for its purpose. This matter has not yet been finally determined upon, but the Board are in hope that ere long it will be settled to the satisfaction of all concerned. In closing this report the Board congratulate the ratepayers on the near completion of the scheme of main drainage for this district, there being now only a few streets not sewered, in accordance with the plan adopted by the Board some ten years since, and contemplate with great pleasure the benefits that have accrued to the district in consequence of its improved sanitary condition, and refer to the report of the Medical Officer of Health for further information on this subject. 7 THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT.

THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER, OF HEALTH. To the Board of Works, Fulham District. Gentlemen, The Annual Reports, which now for thirteen years you have presented to your constituents together with my own, have contained a yearly epitome of the conjoint labours of the several departments under your control. It would indeed he an unsatisfactory circumstance could your efforts be reviewed at this period without the manifest accomplishment of many of the grand results which the legislature and the country expected you to achieve. Probably no district within the Metropolitan area required more activity in the executive than that of Fulham and Hammersmith. Though blessed with a wonderful subsoil of gravel, the natural level of the Fulham District, many parts of which are below high-water mark, had hitherto precluded it from efficient drainage—indeed it might be said had actually kept it undrained. As healthfulness is money, and more than money to an individual, so must its full benefits be more than prized where realized by large communities. It was not many years ago when Hammersmith and Fulham were ranked amongst the unhealthy London Districts. This ban has been removed, the general Metropolitan scheme of drainage has given an outlet to our previously waterlogged condition, and by the persistent energy of your Board, good use has been made of it The schedule which I presented to you with my first general report shewed the absolutely forlorn condition of nearly all the cottage property in the district as regards both drainage and water supply. A reference to that document would prove how much we then depended on the cesspool system, and how greatly the drinking water for the poor prevailed from surface wells and even ditches. The Act which ushered your Board into existence was designed to overcome these evils, and how far your Board and its officers have realized in a sanitary point of view the expectations of the public, will probably become apparent by a recapitulation of the works carried out under your orders, as they are gleaned from this and the twelve annual reports of your Board preceeding it. In these it will be found that the gross number of nuisances of various kinds which have come under the notice of the sanitary committees up to March 25th, 18G8, have been 13,514, that the general character of these has comprised defective privy accommodation and drainage, uncleanly and unwholesome dwellings, defective water supply, swine kept in a state of nuisance and injury to health, with an unsanitary condition of roads and open spaces. It will be seen that of defective privy accommodation 4214 cases have been reported and dealt with, that 4257 drains and gullies have been cleansed, that 2544 unwholesome houses have been cleansed or repaired, that 1021 swine nuisances have been removed, that 1478 nuisances of a miscellaneous character 12 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. have also been reported and attended to, & that 13,310 houses have been benefited by the various operations thus carried out, as shown in the table attached. The number and character of the nuisances dealt with during the last official year will appear as usual in your forthcoming annual report. To this catalogue may be added the fact that many thousand feet of open ditches have been annihilated or abandoned, and covered sewers substituted in their stead, that upwards of one hundred thousand feet, or nearly 20 miles of sewerage works have been constructed within the district, fully one half of which has been constructed by your Board, and that a very considerable number of private sewers have also been constructed in connection with building enterprises. I append a table shewing the principal works referred to. It may not be unworthy of remark that our whole local system of drainage devisnd by your Surveyor Mr. Bean, and approved by yourselves, has so thoroughly harmonized with the Bazelgettian scheme, that now for fourteen years, no hitch arising from our local necessities has marred in any way the general benefit derived therefrom—indeed it may be said that truly in a sanitary point of view the modifications suggested by our local wants, so thoroughly investigated and reported on by your surveyor, have materially tended to satisfy the future as well as the present requirements of the Western Metropolitan area. Amongst the chief results of your supervision also may be mentioned your successful opposition to the deodorizing scheme at Sand's End, Fulham, which, if it had been carried out. would have stamped an irreparable injury on Fulham, and, I believe, would have rendered nugatory the effort to purify this upper portion of the Thames. There are many living amongst us now who scarce could realize the fact that through the length and breadth of both these parishes large open ditches once threaded their circuitous way, carrying their foul contents sluggishly towards our noble river, and yielding poisonous vapours to the inhabitants in their route. All this within a score of years has changed, and though defects undoubtedly may exist in our present Metropolitan regime, still one broad reality such as this will mark the efforts of our time with the coronet of success, and leave an impress on the history of our district which the experience of many generations will not efface. A few short months and we shall see the entire and absolute diversion of the low-level sewage from the Thames, and almost coincident with it, the abstraction of the filth of many local towns. London may then with more complacency depend upon the venerable river for its supply of water for domestic purposes, and not till then, sit comfortably on the pinnacle of security. The time may yet arrive again when the Hammersmith and Chiswick Fishermen may return to their pristine occupation of catching fish at Putney, indeed the craft has already resumed its avocation in Hammersmith reach. The sickness and Mortality returns in the Fulham District in 1868 have not been characterised by any great excess. London as well as the country, have been visited more or less by scarlatina epidemic, but I am happy to be able to report that, the Fulham district has not participated to any 13 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. alarming degree in the prevailing fever, neither has any great amount of general illness added to the ordinary necessities of our poor. Our working classes have not been subject to any dire calamity,, and though individual instances of want of employment might here and there have been manifested, it is doubtful whether individual energy and determination in self dependence, might not in most instances have issued in success. As Typhus and the lower forms of Fever, with Cholera. &c., have hitherto been made questions lor national enquiry, so now does Scarlet Fever require some special investigation. The Registrar General's returns for 1868 show that no less than 2921 lives have been sacrificed to this disease within the Metropolitan districts, that 2483 persons died of other forms of Fever, 2369 from Whooping Cough, and 1989 from Measles. In connection wiih this subject it may not be out of place to remind you of the necessity for providing a public ambulance for the conveyance of patients affected by infectious diseases either to Hospitals or to and from private houses; at present the public vehicles continue to be used for this purpose, and though partially prohibited by statute they still form the only available means. To what extent infectious disease is thus increased it is impossible to calculate. Diarrhoea, in accordance with what has occurred elsewhere, was unusually fatal, and this is not surprising when we take into account the excessive heat and drought of the summer months; 102 deaths have been registered from this cause within the Fulham District. Fevers, however, have not presented any special increase: on the contrary, the number of deaths from the various forms of this complaint excepting Scarlatina, have been only 23. Diptheria has caused 8 deaths, Whooping Cough 30, Cholera 3, and Carbuncle 2. The deaths from Phthisis have been below the usual number, probably the result of a high temperature, and of less than usual subsoil moisture. The number of deaths registered from this disease has been 140. In the Workhouse 58 persons have died, and in Almshouses 3, in Roman Catholic Institutions 28, in Lunatic Asylums 3, and in the West London Hospital 18; 69 inquests have been held, many of which were in cases of deaths from drowning in the Thames. No deaths from Small Pox has been registered during the year 1868. The total Mortality of the Fulham District in 1868 has been 1338, of which Hammersmith has contributed 803, and Fulham 535. Of these deaths 371 occurred in children under 1 year of age, and 650 of the total number under 5 years. Thus again, as in former years, nearly one half of our mortality has been amongst children who have died before they were 5 years old. The number of births registered has been 2206. The deaths of six nonagenarians have been registered in the year. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDK. J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health.
