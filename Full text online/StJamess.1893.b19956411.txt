In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1893. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry again append to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested, 14 THE PARISH. Extent.—The Parish occupies an area of 162 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which 3½ miles are paved with wood, 5¼ with asphalte, ¾ with pitching, 1½ with macadam, and 1½ miles consists of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—The resident population, according to the census taken on the 6th April, 1891, is given by the Registrar-General as 24,995, and the number of inhabited houses as 2,641. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 18. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. Wards.—The Parish has been divided into four Wards for the election of Vestrymen, and this division is followed in the preparation of the Lists of Voters for Member of Parliament, the County Council, and School Board. The name of the Ward is printed on the rate receipt of each ratepayer. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A. is Rector. 15 Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two Members to Parliament; it now, however, forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Hon. W. F. D. Smith. The Register prepared in 1893 contains the names of 3,988 Parliamentary electors, viz., 2 on the Scot and Lot List, 280 Lodgers, and 3,706 possessing other qualifications. There are also 539 County Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Act, 1888, but are not qualified to vote for Members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex, in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish of St. James, number 180. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London, Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division, the present members being Lord Colchester, General Sim, Mr. David Laing, Mr. William Winnett, and Mr. H. N. B. Spink. Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follows :— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico,). So much of the Parish as lies to the South of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 16 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the West of the District supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The rates of charge for a supply of water for domestic purposes authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows :— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30, but is less than £50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service 17 half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). Electricity, both for purposes of light and power, is supplied by the London Electric Supply Corporation and the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company. Each of these. Companies has parliamentary power to supply in any part of the Parish, and is under compulsion to supply any parishioner upon certain specified conditions. The former Company supply an alternating current, with the use of converters or transformers, the latter supply a direct continuous current. The offices of the London Company are at 3, Adelphi Terrace, W.C., and those of the St. James's Company at Carnaby Street. The Coroner is Mr. John Troutbeck, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The Sub- Registrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour © Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. B 18 THE VESTRY, as now constituted under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio members, the latter being the Rector and Churchwardens. It superseded a Vestry elected under the provisions of a permissive statute, 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. This elected Vestry had, in its turn, superseded a select Vestry established by the Act under which the Parish was created in 1685. The select Vestry was virtually a self-appointed body, vacancies being filled up by the surviving members. Neither the ancient select Vestry nor the Vestry elected under the statute of 1831 had any jurisdiction over the paving or drainage of the Parish. Each of these matters was under the control of a separate and distinct body of Commissioners. The Act of 1855 transferred to the Vestry as now constituted, not only all the powers of the earlier Vestry, but also those relating to paving, drainage, and lighting formerly exercised by these Commissioners. Subsequent legislation has laid upon the Vestry various additional duties, and in many respects, the powers of the Vestry within the area of its jurisdiction resemble those of the Town Council of a corporate town, with the addition of rating powers, although as regards the police force, the provision of markets, and the supply of gas and water, not this Parish alone, but the metropolis at large, stands on a different footing from provincial towns of comparatively minor importance. The following pages will show the diversity of subjects coming within the purview of the Vestry, but it may be 19 convenient here to enumerate the more important functions of that body, viz.:— (1) Paving, cleansing, watering, and lighting the public streets. (2) Constructing, maintaining, and cleansing local sewers, public conveniences, etc. (3) Supervising the construction, alteration, and amendment of the drains and sanitary arrangements of dwelling-houses and other buildings. (4) Preventing, removing, and abating nuisances injurious to health, disinfecting after sickness &c. (5) Regulating projections into the public streets, and annoyances of various kinds. (6) Preserving, as far as possible, freedom from adulteration in articles of food and medicine. (7) Levying and collecting the rates, from which large and, unfortunately rapidly increasing, sums are paid annually to authorities entirely independent of local control. Upon the last-mentioned point it may be here observed that there has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes. Thus since the year 1855 the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase maintenance, and re-building: (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes, The extent to which this operates upon b 2 20 local rates will be seen on reference to the statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes, which is given on page 38. THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday, the 29th day of May, the places appointed for the purposes being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Restaurant, King Street, St. James's; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, Craven Hall, Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. 9 The total expense of conducting the elections amounted to £7 16s. 6d., and an order for the payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was made by the vestry in accordance with the statute. RESIGNATIONS. During the year the following Vestrymen have resigned their seats:— Mr. C. E. Baxter Pall Mall Ward Mr. W. H. Dodwell The Vestry have to announce with regret the death of the following members during the year:— Mr. A. W. Dixey, (Church Ward), Mr. G. Biggs, (Church Ward), and Mr. R. Moore (Great Marlborough Ward.) Mr. Dixey had been a much respected member of the Vestry for many years, and for the past five years acted as Chairman of the Finance Committee. 21 Mr. Biggs, also another most respected member of the Vestry, had been a member since 1886, and after Mr. Dixey's death, was appointed Chairman of the Finance Committe, a position which he occupied until the time of his decease. Mr. Moore was appointed a member of the Vestry in 1801, but he did not take a very active part in the administration of the affairs of the Parish. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year Vestry Meetings 25 Finance and House Committee 22 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 21 Works and Improvements Committee 21 Lighting Committee 8 St. James's Dwellings Committee 12 Valuation Committee 8 Special and Sub-Committees 9 Total 126 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Five Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the 22 bye-laws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. Vestry Clerk.—The Vestry and the Parish have sustained a severe loss by the resignation of their able Vestry Clerk, Mr. Harry Wilkins, on his appointment to the Secretaryship of the Lambeth Waterworks Company. Mr. Wilkins was appointed to the office of Vestry Clerk in September, 1882, and has performed the duties devolving upon him with marked ability and. faithfulness. In addition to performing the ordinary duties of the office, Mr. Wilkins has from time to time identified himself with, and taken a prominent part in, various public and metropolitan questions, such as Electric Lighting, School Board Administration, London Water Supply, Assessment of Property, etc., and his loss to the Local Government of the Metropolis will be therefore more keenly felt. The Vestry, in accepting Mr. Wilkins' resignation, passed the following resolution, a copy of which was suitably engrossed on vellum and framed, and handed to Mr. Wilkins :— "That, in accepting with great reluctance the resignation of Mr. Harry Wilkins, their Vestry Clerk, the Vestry desire to place on record their testimony to the great ability, assiduity, and faithfulness Avith which for a period of nearly twelve years he has performed the duties pertaining to his office. His intimate knowledge of assessments and other matters relating to municipal life render his withdrawal from Vestry work a loss to London, a loss that at the present juncture it can ill afford." 23 Mr. Thomas Hensman Munsey, chief clerk to the Vestry of Islington, has been appointed Vestry Clerk in succession to Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Munsey was previously in the service of the Vestry, as First Assistant Clerk, from 1885 to 1889, in which latter year he left to take up the appointment at Islington. Vestry Clerk's Department.—The salary of Mr. Chettleburgh, first assistant clerk, has been increased from £150 to £180 per annum; that of Mr. Crow, accounts, rates, and general clerk, from £170 to £190; that of Mr. Lampard, third assistant clerk, from £100 to £120; and that of Mr. Born, junior clerk, from £20 to £30; all the increases to take effect from Lady Day, 1894. Sanitary Department,—The Vestry have found it necessary to engage a clerk to assist in the clerical work of the Sanitary and Surveyor's Departments, and they have accordingly appointed Mr. T. H. Hooper to the post, at a salary of £80 per annum. The salary of the public analyst, Dr. Edmunds, has been increased from £75 to £100 per annum; while that of the chief sanitary inspector, Mr. W. H. Watson, has been raised from £165 to £175 par annum, both these increases to take effect from the 25th March, 1894. In the early part of the year the salary of Mr. Folland, sanitary inspector, was increased from £120 to £140 per annum. Rate Collectors.—Mr. George Flint, of 18, Warwick, Street, has been appointed rate collector for the Pall Mall Ward, in the place of Mr. F. A. Ashmead, whose resignation was reported in the last annual report. 24 The Vestry handed to Mr. Ashmead a letter, under their common seal, expressing their regret that he felt compelled to relinquish his appointment, and their appreciation of his faithful and efficient services as collector of rates in the Pall Mall Ward for over seventeen years. Generally.—A list of the officers of the Vestry, and their respective salaries will be found on page 156. STANDING ORDERS.

Mr. Julien Grace Bennett, 55, Great Marlborough Street. Mr. James Malin, 16 and 17, King Street, St. James's. Mr. Alfred Winnett, 71 and 73, Wardour Street. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. In accordance with the Local Act of Parliament, the Vestry on the Gth day of April nominated eight parishioners to serve the office of Overseers of the Poor. The names of these gentlemen were submitted to the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held at the Vestry Hall on the 7th April, when the following were appointed Overseers for the year 1893-4 :— Mr. William Truman, 3, Great Marlborough Street. Mr. Daniel Godden, 109, Jermyn Street. Mr. Deasley Andrews, 9, Warwick Street. Mr. Frederick Kyte, 2, St. James's Place. 27 PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. The Vestry avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the completion and opening of the New Swimming Bath in the Autumn of last year, to present to the parishioners a few particulars relating to the Public Baths and Washhouses of the Parish. The Vestry of St. James adopted the Act to encourage the Establishment of Public Baths and Washhouses within four months of its having received the Royal Assent. On the 26 th August, 1846, the Royal Assent was given to the Act in question, and on the 10th December in the same year the Vestry decided to establish Public Baths and Washhouses in the Parish. Consequently St. James's was one of the first Local Authorities to give the "Ratepapcrs the advantages afforded by the Legislature. Seven Commissioners having been appointed to carry the Act into execution some delay occurred in the selection of a suitable site, in consequence of the difficulty of obtaining land owing to the whole of the parish being built upon. Ultimately, with the approval of the Vestry, Public Baths and Washhouses were erected on the site of 16, Marshall Street, the freehold of which belonged to the Parish, and over a portion of the Workhouse Stoneyard adjoining. The building was opened to the public in 1852 and proved itself an immediate success. In the course of a few years to meet the increased demand for improved accommodation for bathing, especially for women, the Commissioners decided to extend the building, and in 1860 they obtained the necessary consents to appropriate a further portion of the Parish Property in Marshall Street, (Nos. 17 aud 18). The increased accommodation provided by this extension was 28 generally appreciated and the number of bathers and washers continued to increase until the maximum was reached in 1865, when 160,480 tickets were issued to bathers and 70,057 to washers, or a total of 230,537 tickets in one year. In 1890 the Commissioners came to the conclusion that to meet the requirements of the district it was necessary to provide an additional Swimming Bath of modern design, and for this purpose they proposed to utilize, subject to the consent of the Vestry and the Local Government Board, the two houses No. 14 and 15, Marshall Street, also belonging to the Vestry. The consent of the Vestry was given to the proposal, and the Local Government Board held the usual Public Inquiry into the circumstances. Although previous notice of the Inquiry had been widely given only three Ratepayers attended to object. After hearing all the evidence tendered the Inspector remarked that he had held many similiar inquiries but did not call to mind one in which it had been so clearly shown that a bath would impose so small a burden, if any, upon the Ratepayers. The Local Government Board subsequently gave their consent and the Commissioners erected the present handsome Swimming Bath. In a Report presented to the Vestry in January the Commissioners state that after long continued delay the new bath was opened on the 31st July last, and although more than half the Swimming season had then expired the number of bathers who made use of the bath during the remaining few weeks seemed to show that it supplied a want in the neighbourhood, and encouraged the Commissioners to hope for a much better result this year when the bath will be opened lor the whole season. 29 The cost of erecting the original building in 1851, and furnishing and extending in 1861, was about £21,000, which sum was borrowed on the security of the Poor Rate. The last instalment of the loan in respect of this amount was paid in 1891. The cost incurred in the erection and fitting of the new Swimming Bath amounts to £5,849 13s. 8d., after deducting the amount contributed by the Vestry for the construction of the storage accommodation which has been provided under the Baths for the extension of the Vestry's Stoneyard. To meet this expenditure it has been necessary for the Commissioners to borrow a sum of £3,000 from the London County Council and obtain a grant of £1,576 13s. from the Poor Rate. The balance of loan now outstanding amounts to £2,400 which is being reduced at the rate of £300 a year. The total payments from the Poor Rate since the adoption of the Act in 1846 to this Lady Day amount to £36,548 3s. 1d. The Commissioners have, however, applied their surplus receipts, amounting to £9,350, in aid of the Poor Rate making a net charge of £27,198 3s. 1d. on the rates. It will thus be seen that for the sum of £27,198 3s. 1d., the Ratepayers have acquired a freehold building which contains, in addition to the necessary offices, store rooms, boiler house, apartments for superintendent, &c., the following accommodation:— Two Swimming Baths (open from April to October), 1st Class, water surface 60 ft. by 22 ft., Charge, 30 including use of costume, 6d. This bath is devoted to the use of ladies on the whole of Wednesday in each week. Second Class, Charge (Week-days), 2d.; Sunday Mornings, 3d. Private Baths (open throughout the year), 3G First Class (23 for men and 13 for women), Charge, Warm, Bath, 6d., Cold 3d., including use of two towels, 54 Second Class (41 for men and 13 for women), Charge, Warm Bath 2d., Cold 1d., including use of one towel. Laundry (open throughout the year). 84 separate Washing and Drying Compartments, Mechanical Wringers, Ironing Room and Mangling Room. Inclusive Charge 2d. per hour. It appears from the last Annual Report of the Commissioners that the number of Batheis (123,533) for the year 1893 was 14,771 in excess of the number for the previous year. This large increase in the number of bathers is very satisfactory to note, the more so as the new bath is not wholly accountable for the increase, the number of bathers frequenting the new bath being 5,193 The Laundry, however, again shows a falling off, and the Commissioners attribute this to the continued diminution in the residental population of the Parish and the provision of Laundries in many new blocks of dwellings for the working classes. Two Commissioners (Mr. W. Jenkins and Mr. Peyton) retired by effluxion of time in January, and were re-elected for the usual term of office, 31 A list of the Commissioners is given on page 11, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1893, and the number of bathers and washers on pages 169-70. Mr. T. J. Chettleburgh, the Vestry's First Assistant Clerk, has been appointed Clerk to the Commissioners, in the place of Mr. Harry Wilkins, resigned. The Vestry, in February last, passed a resolution requesting the Baths Commissioners to supply amended accounts, shewing Capital Account, Revenue Account, and Profit and Loss Account, to which the Commissioners replied that the whole of the facts, figures, and results were already in possession of the Vestry, that they have been audited and approved by the Vestry from time to time, and that the Commissioners have nothing to add to the statements already presented to the Vestry. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S SCHOOL. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. Winnett had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. A statement of the Accounts of the Schools for the year 1893 is given on page 172. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry. The present representative Governors are Mr. F. H. Bingham and Mr, Joseph Pool. 32 The school fees, which are payable in advance at the commencement of each term, are as follows:— Entrance, 5s. for one pupil, and 2s. Cd. for each additional pupil from the same family. Tuition for a pupil entering the school above the age of 10 years, £1 10s. per term. If more than one pupil from the same family, £1 5s. for each, beyond the first. For a pupil entering the school under the age of 10 years £1 5s. per term so long as she shall continue in the school. Dinners are supplied at 7d. each, or 2s. 6d. for the week of five days. Application for admission should be made to the Head Mistress at the School House, Old Burlington Street, where particulars of the course of study may be obtained. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1893 is given on page 173. THE CRAVEN PEST HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity viz., St. Martin-in-the-Fields; St. George, Hanover Square; St. Clement Danes; St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present Trustees so appointed being Mr. J. Bonthron, Mr. W. Winnett, Mr. Tysall, and Mr. Truman. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of 24 beds in Kings College Hospital and 16 in Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes 33 mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford outtreatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. Parishioners requiring hospital treatment may obtain letters at any time during office hours, on application at the Vestry Hall. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1893 is given on page 174. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, which was formerly administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor, has, owing to the abolition of that Board, been placed, by an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated the loth August, 1890, under the management of the Guardians of the Poor elected for this Parish. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1893, is given on page 177. LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's, which arose from a bequest in 1782 by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly. He directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been Housekeepers in the Parish, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish of St. James, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." c 34 As intimated in the last Annnal Report, the Vestry requested the Charity Commissioners to receive a deputation of five members for the purpose of discussing with them the question of investing the funds of this Charity, which at that time consisted of £9,9G9 2s. 9d., 2¾ per cent. Consolidated Annuities, in the purchase of freehold ground rents or some other security bearing a higher rate of interest than Consols, and the appointment of new trustees of the fund, the Rector being the sole survivor. As a result of this application to the Charity Commissioners the Vestry Clerk had an interview with one of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds on the subject, who informed him that the Commissioners would not give any general authority for the purchase of ground rents with charity funds, but that they would consider on its merits any application for the purchase of any specific ground rents. Having regard to the possibility of early legislation rendering ground rents liable to local rates, the Commissioners consider that ground rents should be purchased at such a sum as would yield 4 per cent. interest on the outlay. The ground rents must, moreover, be well secured and favourably reported on by a Surveyor or Valuer appointed by the Commissioners. The expense of obtaining professional advice by the Vestry and by the Commissioners, and the legal expense attending the purchase and Stamp Duty would represent a rather large sum to be charged against the capital sum which the sale of Consols would realize. The Official Trustee suggested for consideration the investment of the fund in India 3 per cents., or some other stock in which trustees are authorised to invest by the Trust Investment Act, 1889. The Vestry were advised that the transfer of stock could be effected immediately and without appreciable cost to the charity ; that an investment in 35 India 3 per cents would yield a higher rate of interest than any other stock referred to in the Act mentioned; and that such stock would probably have an upward tendency in the market when the interest on Consols is reduced to 2½ per cent. nine years hence. r The Vestry accordingly took steps to transfer the Consols into India 3 per cents., and at the same time to transfer the stock into the name of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds. These alterations were carried out and the sum of £9,807 2s. 9d., the proceeds of the sale of the stock belonging to the Bounty, was invested in the purchase of £9,918 13s. 5d. India 3 per cent. stock in which it now stands. It should be stated that the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds are bare trustees without any power over the disposal of the income. In January the Vestry appointed a Special Committee to enquire into the administration of this Charity and to consider as to investing the funds to greater advantage. The Committee had not concluded their deliberations at the close of the year to which this report relates. A statement of accounts for the past year is given on page 176. ST. MARTIN'S ALMSHOUSE AND PENSIONS CHARITY. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprisingex-officio,co-optative,and representative Trustees C 2 36 Two of the latter are elected by the Vestry of this Parish, the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1893 will be found on pages 181 to 184. BLANCHARD'S CHARITY. Mr. William Blanchard, late of Regent Street, who died in January, 1892, left £500 upon trust to the Rector and Churchwardens of this Parish to invest the same in any of the securities sanctioned by his will, and to distribute the income arising therefrom at their discretion annually amongst the poor of the Parish. The sum mentioned has been received and invested in Consols in the name of the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds. OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 185 to 193, and statements of the accounts on pages 175 to 180. FINANCIAL. Poor Rate.—This Account commenced with a balance of £1,047 3s. 11d. in the hands of the Treasurer, the receipts during the year amounted to £100,215 6s. 1d. and expenditure to £103,629 14s. 5d., leaving a balance due to the Treasurer of £2,367 4 s. 5d. at the close of the account at Lady-day. At the last-mentioned date both the assets and the liabilities on this Account were unimportant in amount. 37 Sewers and General Rate.—It will be seen on reference to the Accounts, commencing on page 148, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £18,653 5s. 3d. The sum of £56,084 7s. 9½d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £58,829 0s. 9d., leaving a balance of £15,908 12s. 4½d. on the 25th March, 1894. Against this cash balance, however, there were, on the last mentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £12,595 11s. 8d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £1,242 13s. 3d. leaving a surplus of £4,555 13s. 11d. to be carried to the credit of the present year. LOANS. All loans raised by the Vestry for Paving and other Works have now been paid off. RATEABLE VALUE. The assessment of the Parish, as fixed at the general re-valuation in 1890, gave the following totals:— Gross value £889,649 Rateable value £743,348 The assessment of new buildings and alterations caused by variations in the value of old buildings during the following three years has increased the total assessment of the Parish to the following amounts :— Gross value £903,127 Rateable value £754,399 38 RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows:— Amount in the Pound Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police Rate, expenses of the London County Council, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) s. 2 d. 8 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, and precepts of the School Board for London 1 4 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Total 4 1 The rates for each of the two previous years were 4s. in the pound. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate: £ s. d.

For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by Central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers:— Under control of Local Authority. Poor Rate— £ s. d.

It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £122,612 5s. 10d. of the total of £175,779 18s. 11d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, less than fourpence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. INCREASING RATES. The Vestry received an invitation from the Vestry of St. Anne, Limehouse, in January last, to appoint t wo Delegates to attend a Conference proposed to be held at the Town Hall, Limehouse, with a view to determining upon some 41 united action to be taken with regard to the continual increase of rates in the Metropolis, and to the formation of a Metropolitan (Non-Political) Ratepayer's Protection Asso ciation. The Vestry, however, informed the Limehouse Vestry that they were not prepared to take part in the proposed Conference. ASSESSMENT OF PROPERTY. The Assessment of the undertaking of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company has received consideration at the hands of the Vestry as Overseers during the year, and gave rise to some amount of argument between the Vestry and the Company. It will doubtless interest the parishioners to know the circumstances of the case. When the last general valuation of the Parish was made in 1890, the Company had not then earned any profit from the supply of current, and the Valuation Committee of the Vestry at that time entered the mains of the Company in the Valuation list at an assessment of £100 per mile run, it being understood that the assessment was not to be disturbed until the undertaking had developed sufficiently to justify a re-valuation. Since that time the Company have had continuous and increasing success, so much so that in 1892 they made sufficient profit to pay a dividend of per cent. on their ordinary shares, full interest on their preference capital, and a handsome dividend on the founders' shares, and to carry to depreciation and redemption funds undivided profit sufficient to have paid nearly 10 per cent. more on the ordinary shares. This development of the undertaking, combined with the completion of the Company's new premises in Carnaby 42 Street, necessitated a review of the Assessment and the Valuation Committee in April, 1893, through the Vestry Clerk, placed themselves in communication with the Secretary and Manager of the Company with a view to the mains being re-assessed at a proper amount, and it was suggested that the Company and the Vestry should mutually agree to an assessment., to remain in force until the next re-valuation, to which the Secretary of the Company was understood to have assented. After waiting for some considerable time for figures relating to the undertaking, which the Company had promised to give, but had not done so, the Valuation Committee increased the rateable value of the mains from £250 to £6,480. Against this assessment the Company appealed and claimed to have the rateable value of the mains fixed at £631. The Assessment Committee of the Westminster Union, having-regard to the importance of the case, employed a professional valuer to value the undertaking, which he did as a whole at £9,500, or £1,145 less than the total value fixed by the Overseers. On the hearing of the appeal the Company's Solicitor, without the slightest previous intimation, raised a technical objection that the Committee had only power to increase the assessment by the additional value in the current year as compared with the previous year, and that they had no right to go back to the quinquennial period. The Assessment Committee seemed to think that there was something in the objection referred to, but that the objection was one which should not have been taken, for they disregarded the Company's figures and compromised the assessment of the undertaking as a whole at £7,000 rateable value. Feeling that the Company had not met the Vestry n quite a proper spirit, the Vestry Clerk addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Company on the 43 subject, and subsequently Mr. G. Balfour, M.P., and the Company's Solicitor called upon the Vestry Clerk to explain matters and suggested a compromise. Their explanation amounted to a statement that the Directors were not aware of the arrangement made with the previous manager of the Company in 1890, and they suggested as a compromise that the £7,000 should be adopted as a rateable value without appeal on either side. Having regard to the cost which an appeal to the Sessions and possibly to the House of Lords would involve, and to the small result which it would effect if the Vestry succeeded, as rates on the increased assessment would only be paid to the time of the next quinquennial valuation, the Vestry did not deem it desirable to appeal against the decision of the Assessment Committee. The Vestry, however, informed the Company that they greatly regretted the course which the Company had adopted with regard to the re-assessment of their undertaking, but that, as the difference in amount would work itself out ou the next Quinquennial Valuation List, the Vestry did not propose to appeal, although the only settlement which they could regard as entirely satisfactory would be the assessment of the undertaking at its proper value. It was eventually agreed that the undertaking of the Company should be re-assessed as soon as the accounts for the year 1893 were completed. As mentioned in the last Aunual Report, the Vestry, upon the invitation of the London County Council, deputed Mr. Winnett, the Chairman of the Valuation Committee, and the Vestry Clerk, to represent them at the Conference convened by the Council with a view to securing uniformity of assessment in London. The meetings of the Conference extended over the whole year, the first meeting being held on March 13th, 1893, and the final meeting on March 12th, 44 1894. The resolutions passed by the Conference with a view to promoting uniformity in assessments, set forth the methods to be adopted in valuing different descriptions of properties for the purposes of assessment, and, if followed by the various Eating Authorities in the metropolis, will doubtless tend, to "a large extent, to bring about an equality of assessment throughout London. The Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment Bill, promoted by the County Council last year, also came under the consideration of the Conference as well as the Vestry. The Bill contained some very important alterations in assessment procedure, many of which were considered most objectionable and were strongly opposed by the Members of the Conference, tbe late Vestry Clerk of St. James's taking a prominent part in the opposition to tbe measure. The Bill, for instance, proposed to enable the London County Council to create a Statutory Committee for supervising the assessment of property in the Metropolis, and it was proposed to give the Committee power to appoint officers, incur heavy expenses, and in other respects, to a large extent, act independently of the Council. Clause 19 of the Bill proposed to make it compulsory upon Assessment Committees to appoint expert assistants, subject to the approval of the County Valuation Committee. If, as appeared to be contemplated by the Bill, these assistants were to be permanently appointed, the result would be, not only to largely increase the cost of the valuations of London, without, as the Vestry believed, any corresponding advantage but by limiting their experience, largely dimmish as time goes on, the value attaching to tbe opinion of tbe experts. The most objectionable provision in the Bill, however, was that winch would enable the County Valnation Committee 45 to alter Valuation Lists of Parishes by means of a fiat, thus reversing the accepted form of procedure, and throwing upon Parishes the onus of resisting an order of the County Valuation Committee, instead of requiring the Committee to establish their case, as any other appellant would have to do. The Vestry, while not averse to a well considered amendment of the Valuation laws, were of opinion that the Bill prepared by the advisers of the London County Council was retrogressive in principle, unnecessarily costly in execution, and calculated to work considerable inequality and injustice. They accordingly addressed a communication to the Local Government Board urging the Board not to permit the Bill to proceed further in the House of Commons. Representations on the subject were also made by the Vestry to the London County Council and to the Hon. W. F. D. Smith, M.P. The main features of the Bill were almost unanimously condemned by the Conference before mentioned, and it was ultimately withdrawn by the Council. An amended Bill to meet the resolutions arrived at by the Conference has been introduced on behalf of the Council this Session, but it did not come before the Vestry until after the close of the year to which this Report relates. The Bill is now awaiting its second reading. VESTRY PROPERTY. Vestry Hall.—The Vestry Hall and offices were cleaned as usual during the summer recess, at a cost of £15. The Vestry resolved to provide additional lavatory accommodation for the members by erecting a new lavatory in the rear of the building, in accordance with plans prepared by the Vestry's surveyor, and accepted the tender of Messrs. W. Scrivener & Co., to carrv out the work for the sum of £368. 40 The proposed alterations had not been carried out at the close of the year to which this report relates. Disinfector.—The disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, etc., for parishioneis on 72 occasions compared with 71 in 1892-93 and 57 in 1891-92. Certain repairs to the Disinfector were carried out during the year, at a cost of £10. For the purpose of carrying home clothing after disinfection, the Vestry purchased a truck suitable for the purpose at a cost of £18. Horses.—One of the Vestry's horses (Tommy), bought by the Vestry some 20 years ago, having been certified by the veterinary surgeon to be unfit for work by reason of advanced age, orders were given for the horse to be slaughtered, and for another horse to be purchased at a cost not exceeding £80. Stone yard.—In order to facilitate the lowering and lifting of goods to and from the new stores in the basement under the Baths, a crab and lift were obtained from Mr. J. Stannah, of 20, Southwark Bridge Road, at a cost of £38 exclusive of builder's work. A new stoneyard clerk's office has been erected on the north side of the entrance to the stoneyard, at a cost of £215. The erection of the office in this position necessitated the utilisation of the alternative staircase to the laundry of the Public Baths and Washhouses, to which the Baths' Commissioners gave their consent on condition that the Vestry, at their own expense, entered into an agreement to pay the Commissioners one shilling a year by way of acknowledgment of ownership, and to maintain and repair the superstructure in the event of any subsidence resulting 47 directly or indirectly from the contemplated works. These conditions were assented to by the Vestry. In October last the Vestry approved a plan prepared by their surveyor for asphalting the stoneyard and rearranging the stables. This work involved the removal of the stables to the west side of the yard, and paving the same with blue Staffordshire bricks; the formation of three pits on the east side of the yard, sunk two feet deep, for the storage of ballast, shell, and salt; paving the same with old York ; and the asphalting of the whole of the remainder of the yard on a surface of concrete 12 in. thick, at a total cost of £630. These works were approaching completion at Lady Day, 1894. Mortuary.—The bodies of 27 persons have been received into the mortuary during the year, as compared with 41 during the previous twelve months. The new mortuary and post-mortem room referred to in the last annual report, have been completed and taken into use during the year. A resolution was passed by the Vestry in December last, thanking the Vestry of St. Martinin-the-Fields for their courteous assistance in allowing the use of their mortuary during the rebuilding of that belonging to St. James's. The mortuary-keeper, who also has charge of the disinfector and stoneyard at night, resides at No. 6 Dufours Place, adjoining the stoneyard. The byelaws made by the Vestry with respect to the mortuary are printed on page 68. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thickly. 48 populated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. The house adjacent to the mortuary and stoneyard, and known as No. 6, Dufours Place, the lease of which, as intimated in the last annual report, the Vestry had agreed to take, has been appropriated as a residence for the caretaker of the yard and mortuary, and for accommodation for persons temporarily displaced for the disinfection of their homes. A waiting-room for relatives attending the funerals of persons taken into the mortuary is also provided in this building. The premises were repaired and altered to meet the requirements of the Vestry at a cost of £255, and have been found suitable and convenient for the purposes named. As the main object of providing a mortuary and disinfecting apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed in the Workhouse premises, and the site of five others has been utilised for the erection of the Public Baths and Washhouses. The remaining four houses are let on repairing agreements. The rent 49 received for these four houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. The Guardians of the Westminster Union having under their consideration the question of re-building No. 19, Marshall Street, addressed a communication to the Vestry in April, 1893, suggesting that if the Vestry contemplated dealing with the adjoining property, they would be pleased to confer with the Vestry as to the desirability of carrying out the re-building as a whole. The Vestry accordingly appointed five members to confer with the Guardians on the subject. These gentlemen had an interview with the Guardians, when the subject was fully discussed. While it was recognised at this meeting that it would be very desirable to deal with the property as a whole, certain difficulties presented themselves in regard to ownership, &c., and the Vestry consequently deemed it expedient to appoint a small Special Committee to thoroughly consider the whole question and report as early as practicable. This Committee subsequently presented a Report to the Vestry, which is here inserted for the information of the parishioners:— Report of Special Committee appointed to consider and report on the property belonging to the Parish in Marshall Street. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, W. 1st June, 1893. The Committee having elected Mr. Bonthron their Chairman, proceeded, on the reference by the Vestry of the 25th May, to consider the question of the ownership of the property in Marshall Street, belonging to the Parish, and the desirability of dealing with the same in connection with the proposed D 50 re-building of No. 19, Marshall Street, by the Guardians of the Westminster Union, and agreed to the following report In the year 1819 eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased for parochial purposes from the Earl of Craven for the sum of £6,132. The purchasemoney was apparently paid from the Poor Hate, and the property became vested in the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor, under the provisions of the Act of Parliament, 59 Geo. III., cap. 12., sec. 12; latterly, however, the management of the property has been assumed by the Vestry leaving the Churchwardens and Overseers, in whom the fee is vested, as practically bare trustees of the property. Two of the houses and part of the ground originally attached to the property were devoted to the extension of the Workhouse premises, and on the incorporation of the Westminster Union in the year 1868, became the property of the Union under the Act of Parliament, 30 Vict., cap. 6, sec. 75, subject to compensation being paid to the Parish, under the provisions of an earlier Act of Parliament, 5 and G Will. IV., cap. 69, sec. 3. The amount of this compensation is £1,200 per annum which is applied in aid of the Poor Pate of this Parish. It may be mentioned that the new Workhouse building situate in Poland Street was erected at the cost of the Union, on land purchased by the Union, with the exception of a strip formerly used as a right of way from the back premises into Poland Street. The site of five houses has been utilized for the erection of Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the freehold thereof has become vested in the Commissioners without payment or compensation, pursuant to the Act 9 and 10 Vict., cap. 24, sec. 24. The remaining four houses are let on repairing agreements at the following annual rentals:— No 20 at £42. „ 21 ,, £50. „ 22 ,, £45. „ 23 „ £40 51 The tenancy of No. 20 was last year granted to a new tenant, who expended about £140 in putting the premises in a proper state of repair. The Churchwardens and Overseers cannot grant a term beyond their current year of office, and the Vestry, not being the owners, and indeed, being disqualified by the Statutes of Mortmain from holding property for such a purpose, cannot grant a lease of the houses. Although not trust property in the more limited sense, the houses may be described as being applicable to the Poor Law purposes only and not to the purposes of the Vestry. In the year 1886 it was in contemplation to substantially repair the six houses which were then let on yearly repairing tenancies, but the Churchwardens and Overseers, the Owners, and the Governors and Directors of the Poor, who then managed the property, were confronted with the difficulty that they could neither defray the cost of the repairs from the rates, nor mortgage the property, nor create a tenancy for a sufficient term to justify the tenant expending a large sum of money. Under these circumstances the Local Goverment Board were asked to advise the Parish Officers as to what legal power they had to repair or rebuild the premises, and the following is the Board's reply:— As stated in the Board's letter of 7th April last, it does not appear that the cost of repairing or rebuilding the houses can lawfully be defrayed out of the Poor Rate ; and as the Board understand that the Parish do not want to sell the property, they are of opinion that the best course to adopt would be for the property to be let on lease under section 3 of 5 & 6 William IV., cap. 69, subject to the condition that the Lessees shall rebuild the houses, or put them into a proper state of repair. If the property were so let, and it became necessary, before the expiration of the lease, to acquire any part of the property for the purpose of extending the Workhouse, it would be competent for the Guardians of the Westminster Union with the consent of the Board, to acquire the part required under the provisions of sections 51—54 of 30 & 31 Vic., cap. 6 ; or if it is thought likely that the property may d 2 52 be required for that or any other purpose, power might be reserved in the lease for the lessors to determine the tenancy on certain terms. Sec. 3 of 5 & 6 William IV., cap. 69, referred to in the abovementioned communication from the Local Government Loard, enacts that it shall be lawful for the Guardians of any Parish or Union, and for the Overseers of any Parish not under the management of a Board of Guardians, with the approbation and subject to the rules, orders and regulations of the Local Government Board, to sell, exchange, let, or otherwise dispose of any buildings or other property belonging to any such Parish, provided that no such sale, exchange or letting shall take place except with the consent of a majority of the ratepayers of such Parish, and of the owners of property therein, assembled at a meeting of which public notice has been given. A question may arise whether the Overseers or the Guardians are the proper authority to let the property, but, however the property may be let, there is no doubt that if the Guardians require it for Poor Law purposes, and obtain the consent of the Local Government Board, the property will become transferred to the Guardians on payment of compensation to the persons disturbed, and to the Parish as former owners. No doubt the consent of the Local Government Board could be obtained to the property being appropriated, subject to the contingency above referred to, to the erection of dwellings for the working classes under Section 39 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, after the Vestry had ordered the demolition of the property as unsanitary and not merely ruinous buildings under other sections of the same Act It is not clear that the Vestry have any power to erect such dwellings at the expense of the rates. Even if they have, it is difficult to see how the Local Government Board can sanction any part of the property being appropriated by the Vestry for Stoneyard or similar purposes in connection with the erection of dwellings for the working classes under the Act referred to. In other words, the Vestry might be able to obtain the consent of the Local Government Board to their taking a lease of the land under the Act 5 & 6, William IV., cap. 69, for a Stoneyard or for any other purpose for which the Vestry are enabled to hold land 53 or to the letting of the land for the erection of dwellings for the working classes under that Act, or the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890; but it is not clear how the two could be combined. Being a corporation the Vestry can only acquire or hold lands for such purposes as they are authorised to do by law. If they exceed their statutory powers in this respect, not only would any expenditure be illegal and liable to be surcharged but the land itself would pass to the Crown. Having regard to the difficulties attending the tenure of the property, the Committee regret to have to report that the Vestry are precluded from taking immediate joint action with the Guardians for the re-building of the property. Your Committee recommend that a copy of the foregoing report be sent to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, with an intimation that if the idea of removing the Workhouse in the Country, to which allusion was made at the last meeting of the Vestry, takes practical shape, it would be well worth consideriug whether the Guardians and the Vestry should not co-operate in applying for a Special Act of Parliament to enable the Vestry to deal with the property of the Parish in a comprehensive manner. JOHN BONTHRON, Chairman. In September the Vestry received a communication from the Guardians enclosing a party wall notice under the Metropolitan Building Act, 1855, relating to the rebuilding of 19, Marshall Street, but up to the close of the year to which this report relates no further steps had been taken in the matter. A further communication was received by the Vestry from the Guardians in October last, intimating that it might be necessary for them to acquire the four houses in Marshall Street belonging to the Parish for the erection of a new laundry, and asking what area the houses occupy 54 and the date when the property could be handed over if wanted. This letter was referred to the Vestry's Sanitary and Parliamentary Bills Committee who requested the Guardians to receive a few members of the Vestry in conference to discuss the question of appropriating the Parish property in Marshall Street for the erection of a new laundry and suggested that the first step to be taken at such Conference be to inspect the present laundry accommodation for the Workhouse. To this communication the Guardians replied that they failed to see that any useful purpose could be served by the suggested Conference. As the Committee had no desire or intention to question or interfere with the discretion of the Guardians in the administration of the Workhouse, they expressed their regret to the Guardians that any misunderstanding should have arisen with regard to their attitude in the matter. The Committee were under the impression that if the property in Marshall Street was appropriated for poor law purposes the compensation payable to the Parish in respect thereof would be considerably less than the value of the property based on ordinary commercial principles. Seeing that St. James's already contributes the greater part of the money required for the common charges of the Union, the Committee thought that admitting the new Laundry is required, some alternative proposals might be suggested and considered at a Conference of the kind referred to, with a view, if possible, to some scheme being adopted which would not entail upon this Parish the undue cost involved in the appropriation of the property in question. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. Under the system adopted by the Vestry, the roadsweepers are employed and paid by the Vestry, but the 55 collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &c., are done under contract. The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the accounts was £8,100 7s. 2d, compared with £7,885 2s. 1d. for 'the previous year. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the Year:— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust nil. 10,086 Slop nil. 5,503 The cost of Street Watering last year was £1,161 2s. 7d. or £120 18s. 10d. more than in 1892-3. WORKMEN'S SICK FUND. A sick fund, on the principle of a slate club, limited to the Vestry's workmen, has been in operation since the 1st August, 1887. The Vestry contribute the sum of 5s. a week to the funds of the club, in lieu of allowing sick pay to individual workmen. The bulk of the surplus is divided among the members at Christmas in the usual way, but one of the rules requires that a balance of not less than £10 be carried forward at the end of each year to provide for the payment of sick allowances before sufficient money has been received from members' subscriptions to meet necessary outgoings. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of the approach of winter, the Vestry sought and obtained permission from the Thames Conservators and the London County Council, to cast clean snow 50 over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river. Arrangements were also made for the hire of additional horses and carts should occasion require. The steps taken for cleaning the streets alter each snowfall during the past winter are mentioned in the Surveyor s Report. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on pages 163 to 165. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1893, there were 830 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, and this number was decreased by 2\ during the year. At Lady-day, 1894, there were 786 ordinary street lamps, 6 metered urinal lamps, and 35½ larger lamps attached to refuges, &c., making a total of 827½. The cost of lighting 3 lamps on refuges in the Haymarket is borne equally between this Vestry and the Vestry of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. This accounts for the ½-lamp just referred to. The ordinary street lamps consume 5ft. of gas per hour, and are lighted, extinguished, and cleaned by the Gas Company, at an inclusive sum of £2 17s. 8d. per lamp per annum. As regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total expenditure for street lighting during the past year amounted to £2,722 17s. 2d., as compared with £2,686 4s. 4d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of maintenance, repairs, and new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which involved further payments amounting to £523 5s. 7d. 57 PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps except upon the following conditions:— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamp shall be suspended by ball and socket joint only. 5. That no lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps with their dimensions and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The second generating station of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company, which at the time of the Vestry's last Annual Report was approaching completion, was opened in the month of May, and the Company are now supptying electricity both from their station in Carnaby Street and that in Mason's Yard. The Vestry's attention having been directed to the accounts of the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company for the year 1892, as audited by the Official Auditor, the attention of the Board of Trade was called to the sum of £3,869 15s. 0d. written off for depreciation, and 58 to the transfer of the sum of £1,000 from Revenue to Redemption Fund. The Vestry felt that when the time arrives for making a representation to the Board of Trade under the 53rd section of this company's order, with a view to obtaining a reduction in the price charged for the current, any undivided profit, such as that before mentioned, should be regarded as forming part of the company s undertaking to the same extent as the profits actually distributed among the shareholders, and they accordingly brought the matter under the notice of the Board of Trade so that it may receive consideration when the time arrives in 189G to apply for a reduction of price. Complaints having been made by inhabitants of the parish of their rest being disturbed, owing to the breaking up of the streets with chisels and sledgehammers during the night by Electric Light Companies, the Vestry, on being informed that the County Council frequently impose a condition, with their consent, that the work shall be proceeded with continuously night and day, addressed a communication to the London County Council in January last, requesting that such a condition should not be imposed in the future, except in cases of absolute necessity. The Council informed the Vestry, in reply, that the condition requiring Electric Light Companies to carry on work in the streets during the night is imposed only in those cases in which it appears necessary in order to prevent prolonged interference with the traffic, and intimated that the request of this Vestry will be borne in mind in future. ALLEGED NUISANCE FROM ELECTRIC LIGHT STATION, MASON'S YARD. It will be seen from last year's report that several complaints have from time to time been received by the 59 . Vestry of the nuisance caused by offensive smells and dust proceeding from the Electric Light Station in Mason's Yard, and that the Vestry had been in frequent communication with the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Co. on the subject. At the time of issuing last year's report the annoyance had been sensibly diminished, although not altogether abated, and the Directors of the Company pledged themselves to devise a complete remedy as soon as the opening of their station in Carnaby Street left them free to effectually overhaul their furnaces and shaft. During the year, however, the nuisance has been as bad as ever, and continued complaints have been made to the Vestry of the annoyance caused to the inhabitants in the neighbourhood. The Vestry's attention was also called to the turning of scalding water and steam into the Vestry's sewer in such quantities as to constitute an improper use of the sewer, and to cause inconvenience and annoyance to the inhabitants and the sewermen, such water and steam being found to emanate from the Electric Light Company's Station in Mason's Yard. In consequence of these complaints the Vestry have directed proceedings to be taken against the Company, either at the Police Court or in the High Court, as they may be advised, with a view to the abatement of the nuisances in question. STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The 60 cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:— Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James' Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Most of the paving and drainage works during the past year consisted of maintenance and repair, and details of the work will be found in the Surveyor's Report commencing on page 133. 61 REFUGES. An additional Refuge was formed during the year in Piccadilly, facing Burlington Arcade. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish Coventry-street, by the Haymarket. Great Marlborough-street. Haymarket, by Pall Mall. ,, by Charles-street. „ by Coventry-street. Pall Mall, by the Haymarket. ,, by the United Service Club. ,, by the Athenaeum C!ub. „ by St. James's Palace.

Waterloo Place (two). 62 CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways : 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 195, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty-seven years since. 63 Without here entering further into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the death-rate of the parish was 18.80 per 1,000 for the year 1893. The cases of fever were again unusually numerous during the year, but were chiefly infantile in character. Thus, 107 cases of scarlet fever; 20 of enteric or typhoid fever; 47 of diphtheria; 3 of puerperal fever; 32 of erysipelas; 3 of continued fever; and 50 of small pox, came under the knowledge of the sanitary officers, but only 28 deaths were attributable to these diseases. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent insanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishtioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. Another and most valuable mode of assisting and maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to insure immunity from sickness generally. The great preventive of disease is cleanliness—cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and cleanliness of surroundings. The Vestry, as the local 64 Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but, unless the parishioners generally heartily co-operate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Vestry will be rendered nugatory. Bye-Laws under Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The following series of regulations and bye-laws under the above-named Act with respect to the management of Public Lavatories and Sanitary Conveniences, the management of the Mortuary, for the Prevention of Nuisances, with respect to the keeping of Water Closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action, and with respect to the cleansing of cisterns have been made by the Vestry during the year. Regulations with respect to the management of Public Lavatories and Sanitary Conveniences within the said Parish. With Respect to the Duties of Attendants. 1.—The Lavatories and Conveniences shall be opened each morning; (except Sunday) at Seven o'clock, and kept open until One o'clock the following morning.

DUST REMOVAL. Under their contract with the Vestry the Dust Contractors are required to send a cart, or carts, into every street in the Parish on every week day. If any difficulty is experienced in obtaining a removal of refuse, application should be made at the Vestry Hall. The removal of house refuse would be greatly facilitated by the general adoption of portable dust receptacles. These should not on any account be placed in the street, but kept within the householder's premises in some convenient place readily accessible to the dustmen. They should not be so large as not to admit of being taken up by a man unaided. The refuse would thus be removed bodily and speedily, avoiding the dirt and unpleasantness inseparable from the system of transferring the contents of a dustbin to a basket for removal. 78 INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFICATION. During the year ended at Lady-day, 293 certificates were received by the Medical Officer of Health relating to parishioners suffering from infectious disease, viz. Small-Pox 57 Cholera (Infantile) 0 Diphtheria 50 Membraneous Croup 0 Erysipelas 44 Scarlet Fever 113 Typhus Fever 0 Typhoid Fever 19 Relapsing Fever 0 Continued Fever 2 Puerperal Fever 2 Total 293 The question of the plural notification of the same case of infectious disease was brought under the notice of the Vestry by the Vestry of Roth erhi the, with a view to some united action being taken to bring the matter to the notice of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. It appeared from a report presented to the Rotherhithe Vestry by their Medical Officer of Health that on more than one occasion cases had occurred where the same case of infectious disease had been notified by two or three different Medical Practitioners, and it was suggested that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be requested to allow a single notification in each complaint to be sufficient, on the ground that these dual or treble notifications involve unnecessary cost and are not fair to the parish, as they make the list of infectious cases appear to be greater than the actual number of such cases. 79 The Vestry informed the Vestry of Rotherhithe that they agreed with their views as to the unnecessary cost incurred by reason of such plural notification, and as to the inconvenience and misconception arising therefrom, but that they feared that any amendment of the law to check the same might result in infectious cases not being reported to the Sanitary Authority at all. In connection with the question of the notification of infectious diseases the Medical Officer of Health of the Parish brought under the notice of the Vestry an important question which had arisen as to the correct interpretation to be put upon Sec. 55 (1) (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Two or three cases had occurred in a hospital in the parish of patients contracting a notifiable disease, such as scarlet fever, after seven weeks' residence in the hospital, and certificates were sent by the Medical Officer of the hospital to the Medical Officer of Health of this Parish, but on copies thereof being sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board in compliance with the Act, the Clerk of that Board declined to accept them on the ground that the certificates should have been sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district from which the patient was originally removed, and not the Medical Officer of Health of this district. The Section requires every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit a patient suffering from a notifiable disease to forthwith send to the Medical Officer of Health of the district a certificate giving certain specified particulars. The Section goes on to say that where the certificate refers to an inmate of a hospital, it shall specify the place from which and the date at which the inmate was brought to the hospital, and shall be sent to the Medical Officer of 80 Health of the district in which the said place is situate. The intention of the section, no doubt, is to give the Medical Officer of Health of the district from which the patient was removed, within the period of the incubation of the disease, a direct notification of the appearance of the disease. The words of the Section, taken by themselves, appear to bear no other interpretation than that put upon them by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Th;is interpretation, however, in many instances defeats the evident intention of the Legislature. For instance, a patient in a hospital for consumption might contract a fever two years after his admission, and it is absurd to suppose that the Legislature really intended that in such a case a certificate should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district from which the patient had been removed two years previously, and not to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the hospital itself is situate. If an epidemic were to occur at the Throat Hospital, for example, and certificates relating to the different patients were sent to the various parts of the Kingdom as the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board contends, instead of to the Medical Officer of Health of this Parish, it might not be until the epidemic had obtained a foothold in the Parish from infection from the hospital that the Medical Officer would obtain any knowledge of the outbreak. The Vestry, believing that the interpretation put upon the Section by the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board would defeat the evident object of the Section taken as a whole, addressed a communication to the Local Government Board asking the Board either to issue an explanatory circular as to the course to be followed in such cases, or if in their opinion further legislation is necessary, to take the earliest 81 practicable opportunity of introducing a Bill into Parliament requiring that a certificate relating to a patient in a general hospital contracting or suffering from any notifiable disease should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which such hospital is situate, instead of, or as well as, to the Medical Officer of Health of the district from which such patient was removed. The Local Government Board subsequently replied, in answer to the Vestry's communication, that they concurred with the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board as regards the interpretation to be put upon the Section referred to, and added that the Vestry's suggestion as to an alteration of the law would be noted for consideration. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR INFECTIOUS SICK. In May, 1893, the Metropolitan Asylums Board addressed a communication to the various Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis intimating that new cases could only be admitted into the Board's Fever Hospitals as vacancies occurred, asking that the Sanitary Authorities would instruct their officers to give preference to the removal of patients who, in consequence of their surroundings and conditions of life, were in most need of hospital treatment, and requesting that applications for admission to hospitals which were not complied with might be repeated day by day. The communication addressed to this Vestry was referred by the Vestry to the Sanitary staff for attention. In consequence of this communication, the Vestry of St. Marylebone convened a conference of representatives from the Sanitary Authorities of London, together with the F 82 Medical Officers of Health, with the object of approaching the Local Government Board on the subject of further hospital accommodation being provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for cases of fever, and this Vestry appointed Mr. Bonthron and Mr. Winnett, with the Medical Officer of Health, to represent them on the subject. The conference was held 011 the 28th June, 1893, when the following resolutions were passed :— (1) That, in view of the urgent necessity of further provision being made for the rapidly increasing number of persons suffering from Infectious Disease, and the declared inability of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide the necessary accommodation, this conference do appoint a deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board for the purpose of urging them to facilitate the acquisition of sites by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or the provision of suitable buildings. • 2) That the deputation to wait upon the Local Government Board do consist of three members from each sanitary authority of the Metropolis. (8) That copies of the resolutions be sent to the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the sanitary authorities of the Metropolis. In accordance with the foregoing resolutions the Vestry appointed the same gentlemen as represented them at the conference to join the deputation to the Local Government Board. REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE MATTER THROUGH STREETS. The bye-laws proposed to be made by the London County Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for prescribing the times for the removal or carriage of any 83 fœcal or offensive or noxious matter or liquid in or through London, received consideration by the Vestry, when the Vestry deemed it expedient to invite the consideration of the Council to the desirability of altering the hours proposed both for the removal and conveyance through the streets of such matter. The bye-law proposed by the Council would prevent the removal of fcecal and offensive matter late at night or early in the morning,which the Vestry were inclined to think was the most suitable time for the work to be done, as it is the practice for the trade refuse of some of the large retail fishmongers in the district to be removed late each evening during certain seasons of the year, and it appeared to the Vestry that it would be wise to encourage a continuance of this practice rather than to permit the removal to take place at 10 o'clock the following morning. The Vestry accordingly suggested to the Council that the removal of offensive matter should be restricted between some such hours as 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., instead of during the hours proposed by the bye-law. The Council did not, however, see their way to comply with the Vestry's suggestion. CUTTING OFF WATER SUPPLY TO INHABITED HOUSES. In February last a communication was received from the Vestry of Fulham, asking if the Vestry would be willing to co-operate in endeavouring to get the law altered so as to deprive Water Companies of the power which they now possess and exercise by rendering premises insanitary by cutting off the water supply. The powers given to Water Companies in this direction have been considerably limited by the provisions contained in the Water Companies (Regulation of Power) Act, 1887, which prevent a Water F 2 84 Company cutting off the water supply from any occupied dwelling house by reason of the non-payment of water rates in cases where the owner and not the occupier is liable to pay the water rate. In addition to this the Public Health Act of 1891 provides that within twenty-four hours after cutting off the water supply of any inhabited dwelling house, the Water Company is to give notice thereof to the local sanitary authority. Having regard to these facts, the Vestry did not deem it advisable to co-operate with the Vestry of Fulham in the direction indicated. CHOLERA. In June, 1893, the Vestry received a circular communication from the Local Government Board calling attention to their previous letter of the 25th August, 1892, and forwarding, for the information of the Sanitary Authority, a copy of a memorandum by the Board's Medical Officer, from which it appeared that there was reason for Sanitary Authorities preparing in advance to prevent the extension of any Cholera that might be imported into their Districts during tho summer of 1893. The Local Government Board, in their circular already referred to, called attention to the powers vested in them under section 134 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and section 82 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to issue Epidemic Regulations imposing upon Sanitary Authorities the duty of making arrangements for the prevention and treatment of cholera. Those arrangements would comprise the appointment of Committees for the purpose of carrying out the Regulations, the division of the sanitary district into special areas, the appointment of medical visitors for the visitation of the poorer houses and the detection of 85 cholera and diarrhoea, the supply of medical attendance and nursing, and of medicine and disinfectants, and the provision of dispensaries and of such additional hospitals and places of refuge as might be necessary for the several parishes and districts ; the hospitals being provided for the reception of those cholera patients who could not properly be treated in their own homes, and the places of refuge for the lodgment of those persons not actually sick whom it might be right to keep under observation or to accommodate while their homes were either under disinfection or were devoted to sick persons who could not properly be removed. The Board suggested in their letter of the 22nd June, that the Vestry should take into their early consideration the question of their readiness to meet any emergency that might arise, and requested to be informed how far the preliminary action taken in the previous year, or since decided on by the Vestry, might be regarded as enabling them, without undue delay, to perform the duties which would devolve upon them in the event of the Board finding it necessary to issue regulations of the kind referred to. In reply to the communication of the Local Government Board, the Vestry informed the Board that the subject had engaged the earnest attention of the Sanitary Committee of the Vestry at successive meetings, and that they believed all necessary arrangements had been made to cope with an epidemic of Cholera should the necessity unfortunately arise. The Medical Officer of Health reported that so far as he could ascertain there was not the slightest reason to suppose that there was anything in the existing condition of the Parish to apprehend any large amount of sickness from 86 bowel complaints of any kind, and that the only cause of danger was the introduction of the disease by persons arriving from an infected place. Under these circumstances the Committee felt that they could not lay down any precise line of action at that period beyond being generally prepared to deal with cases which might come under notice in such a manner as to prevent the spread of the disease. They therefore confined their attention to measures of precaution. These included directions for the Committee to be specially convened at very short notice should occasion require, upon the understanding that Sab-Committees should then be appointed; each Sub-Committee to keep a very limited area under observation and to see that any Regulations of the Local Government Board and directions of the Sanitary Committee were carried into effect. As regarded hospital accommodation the Committee were in hopes that the thirty beds in the Workhouse, Poland Street, which the Guardians of the Westminster Union were prepared to set apart for Cholera cases, would be sufficient for the purpose. With regard to out-treatment the Medical Officer of Health had been authorised to establish a dispensary at 6, Dufour's Place, which is in the centre of the poorer part of the Parish, on the first appearance of anything approaching an epidemic, for a gratuitous supply of medicine, &c., and to engage qualified assistants both for the dispensary and for visiting the sick in their homes. It was also proposed to utilise, to some extent, the local Dispensaries in a similar manner. The contract which was entered into early in the year, for the supply of 87 infectants would meet all the necessities of the case under that head, and if it should be found necessary to remove healthy persons from rooms occupied by infectious sick accommodation would be provided for them at 6, Dufour's Place, part of which was about to be furnished as a lodging for persons temporarily displaced for the disinfection of their rooms. In connection with this subject, the Vestry, in October passed a vote of thanks to the Committee of the Westminster General Dispensary, Gerrard Street, for the kind and ready manner in which they intimated their willing, ness to assist the Vestry in dealing with cholera if occasion required. Fortunately, however, no case of Cholera was reported in the Parish. BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. • The Vestry having received an invitation from the British Institute of Public Health to appoint delegates to take part in the Annual Congress for 1894, proposed to be held in London from July 26th to 31st inclusive, appointed the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee (Mr. John Bonthron), Mr. Angold, and the Medical Officer of Health, delegates to the said Congress. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. This property continues to be well let although necessarily there have been several changes of tenants during the year. Since the last report of the Vestry a further sum of £300 88 has been invested towards extending the operations of the trust or replacing the capital 011 the expiration of the leases. One of the basement rooms having become vacant, an application was made by Mr. Costa, of 10, Ryder-street, for the tenancy of the room in question for a term of five years on condition that a direct opening was made from Ingestre Place and a special ladder fixed so that a man might carry coods to and from the basement. This alteration was made and the room let to Mr. Costa for a term of five years at an increased rental. A copy of the accounts of the Trust funds will be found on pages 107 and 168. As enquiries are frequently made as to the origin and cost of those dwellings, the following copy of the statement deposited in the cavity of the foundation stone is here reprinted for the information of the Parishioners. The funds for the erection of this Building were mainly derived from the sale of the Burial Ground situate in Hampstead Road and formerly belonging to the Parish of St. James, "Westminster. The sale was effected under the provisions of a Special Act of Parliament obtained by the London and North-Western Railway Company in the year 1883. The Company sought power to acquire, on payment of .£15,000, so much of the Burial Ground as had not been disposed of under the St. James's Chapel Act, 1869. The Company were, however, restricted by Parliament from taking the whole of the ground for the purposes of their undertaking, and the Trustees of the Burial Ground were required by the Act of 1888 to convey a specified portion to the Company for the sum of .£8,000, and the remainder of the ground without further consideration to the Vestry of St. Pancras (within which Parish the Burial Ground was situate) to be by them preserved as an open space. The purchase money was directed by the Act to be applied to such ecclesiastical, parochial and other purposes 89 for the benefit of the Parish of St. James as the Trustees, with the sanction of the Vestry, might direct. The money was paid into Court by the Railway Company and the Burial Ground conveyed as to a portion thereof to the Company and as to the remainder to the Vestry of St. Pancras. After mature deliberation, the Trustees decided to apply one equal moiety of the fund to ecclesiastical purposes, and the other moiety to secular purposes for the benefit of the Parish, and the Vestry sanctioned this mode of applying the money. The moiety applicable to ecclesiastical purposes having been paid over to the Rector and Churchwardens upon certain definite trusts, it became necessary to decide upon the particular secular purpose to which the remainder of the money should be devoted, and after having considered several proposals, the Trustees with the sanction of the Vestry, decided to apply the same, amounting to about £4,000, to the erection of a building for the accommodation of the labouring poor. This fund was supplemented by the assignment of a leasehold house known as No. 7, Ingestre Place, which had been erected by voluntary effort in or about the year 1850, as a model lodging house, and a sum of about £2000 being accumulated surplus rents derived therefrom, also by the transfer of a further sum of nearly £80 being the unapplied balance of a fund raised for the relief of sufferers by a fire which occurred in Little Windmill Street in the year 187G, and by the transfer of a sum of £200, a portion of the funds remaining in the hands of the Trustees at the closing of the Trust in July, 1886, under the provisions of the London and North-Western Railway Act 1884, The total sum thus available for the building is nearly £6,300. The Building is erected by the authority of an Order of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) made by Mr. Justice Pearson on the 3rd day of August, 1885, the scheme being set forth therein as follows :— 1. The funds are to be applied by the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster (hereinafter called the Vestry) in or towards the erection and fitting up on the land comprised in the agreement dated the 18th May, 1885, and made between Sir Richard Francis Sutton of the first part and the Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in the County of Middlesex, of the second part, of a lodging house 90 or lodging houses to be used together with the leasehold messuage and premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, for the accommodation at moderate rents of female pieceworkers and others of the labouring classes. 2. Such lodging house or lodgings houses and the premises No. 7, Ingestre Place, are to be vested in the Vestry and to be under the control and management of the Vestry or a Committee appointed by them. A proper declaration or declarations of Trust of the premises comprised in the said Agreement for lease and of No. 7, Ingestre Place, shall be executed by the Vestry and enrolled pursuant to the Acts of 9 George 2nd, chapter 86, and 24 Victoria chapter 9. 8. Any surplus income of the said properties after providing for repairs and other outgoings and expenses of management shall be invested in the name or names of the Vestry or of Trustees to be appointed by the Vestry, and applied in such manner as the Vestry with the approval of the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales or a court of competent jurisdiction shall hereafterdetermine,eitherin perpetuating and extending the operations of the scheme or for other purposes in or for the benefit of the said parish. Plans were invited from the four undermentioned Architects, all of whom possess special knowledge of the requirements of Artisans Dwellings:— Mr. H. H. Collins, 61, Old Broad Street, E.C. Mr. II. M. Eyton, Ipswich. Mr. E. C. Robins, 14, John Street, Adelphi. Mr. Ernest Turner, 246, Regent Street. No premium was offered, but a stipulation was made that if either design was adopted by the Vestry, the author thereof should be appointed Architect at the usual rate of remuneration. Each of the Architects named sent in a set of drawings, and the Vestry were assisted in their choice by Mr. John Thomas Wimperis, of 25, Sackville Street, and Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols, of 3, Howard Street, Strand, who generously acted as honorary professional advisers. These gentlemen reported in favour of the design 91 of Mr. H. H, Collins, and this report was approved by the Special Committee appointed to consider the matter and unanimously adopted by the Vestry. Mr. H. H. Collins was accordingly appointed Architect, and tenders for the erection of the building upon quantities taken out by Messrs. Gardiner, Son, and Theobald, of 110, Great Russell Street, were invited from seventeen firms of builders, each of whom sent in a tender. Certain modifications were subsequently made in the quantities, and the tender of Mr. Mark Gentry, of 2, Wormwood Street, in the City of London, to carry out the work on the revised quantities for the sum of £5,573 was accepted. The Land upon which the building is to be erected is held on lease from Sir Richard Francis Sutton, Bart., for the term of 03 years from the 24th June, 1885, at a ground rent of <£50 per annum ; the original ground rent of £75 having been reduced by Sir R. F. Sutton in consideration of the object for which the building was to be erected. The building is designed to comprised 23 single room tenements, 12 two room tenements, two rooms for the caretaker, and a general washhouse and work room. The work is commenced in the hope that it will benefit the poorer of the labouring classes in the parish, to an ever increasing extent, as the surplus rents admit of an extension of the operations of the Trust. REGISTERED HOUSES. No additional houses have been registered during the year under the sanitary regulations of the Vestry made under the provisions of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. At Lady-day, 1894, thirty-five houses were on the register. The additional powers conferred upon the Vestry by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, have considerably diminished the importance and necessity of registering houses under the above-mentioned regulations. 92 INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding aud sanitary condition of retail bakehouses is given for the information of the parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subjected to the following requirements :— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from eftluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the coursc of the manufacturing process that may be injurious to health. (c) The ccilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap at least once in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 93 8. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law; bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (27 in number) are under periodical inspection by the Sanitary officers of the VestryIt has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspectors, and submitted to the Public Analyst appointed by the Vestry, during the year:— Arrowroot 3 Butter 16 Cocoa 6 Coffee 9 Milk 23 Mustard 2 Vinegar 14 Claret 1 74 Proceedings were taken in seven cases. In six of these cases fines were inflicted, and in the seventh (a case of vinegar certified to contains only 312 per cent. of true acetic acid) the summons was dismissed with costs, in con. sequence of the Magistrate having received a letter from the Government Analysts at Somerset House, stating in reply 94 to his enquiry that the standard adopted by them for genuine vinegar of the weakest quality was 3 per cent. of acetic acid. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is as follows £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Furchase of Samples, &c. 4 5 0 • £76 5 0 Standard for Milk. The Vestry had under consideration in November last, a letter from the Vestry of Battersea asking them to support certain representations made by them to the Local Government Board in favour of the adoption of a recognised standard for milk for the purpose of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Vestry, in reply, informed the Vestry of Battersea that they were not prepared to support their representations, on the ground that the adoption of such a standard would probably tend to the universal adulteration of milk of superior quality, by practically legalizing the addition of water to such an extent as would not reduce the quality of the milk below the recognised standard. SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out in the following cases:— Adulteration 7 Depositing rubbish on the carriage-way 2 Non-payment of accounts for paving works, etc. 2 Offences under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 7 Total 18 95 Fines were inflicted in 10 cases; in one the summons was not proceeded with, the "underground room in respect of which the summons was taken out being discontinued for use as a separate dwelling; a closing order in respect of insanitary premises was made with 6s. costs; an order for payment of an outstanding account for paving works was also made; in two cases the defendants were dismissed with a caution; one summons in respect of overcrowding was withdrawn, the property having changed hands and the costs being paid ; a summons was withdrawn in respect of an account for paving works, the amount in question with costs having been paid ; and a summons in respect of adulteration was dismissed with costs. In addition to the above-mentioned summary cases, proceedings have been taken against certain persons concerned in the management of brothels. DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several prosecutions for keeping disorderly houses have been undertaken during the year on the complaints of ratepayers, and a conviction was obtained in each case. In some cases, where circumstances did not appear to render legal proceedings necessary or expedient, notice was given to the responsible parties, with the effect of causing a discontinuance of the annoyance. The Vestry desire it to be understood that they are prepared to take legal proceedings against keepers of disorderly houses on complaint being made to them, and on two ratepayers undertaking to produce material evidence sufficient to justify a prosecution. 96 DRINKING FOUNTAINS. There were at Lady-day but two Drinking Fountains in this Parish, both of which are situate in the Churchyard wall in Piccadilly. These Fountains were erected and are • maintained without cost to the Vestry. LAVATORIES AND SANITARY CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. During the twelve months ended at Lady-day, the men's closets have been used by 208,478 persons, the ladies' conveniences by 206,601, the men's lavatory by 43,186, and the ladies' lavatory by 6,872. No record is kept of the use of the urinals, for which no charge is made, but they were resorted to by a very large number of persons during the year, and prove every year that they supply a much needed want in the neighbourhood. It will be seen on reference to the accounts (pages 150 and 154), that the fees received during the year for the use of the lavatories and conveniences amounted to £1,938 7s. 10d. and the outgoings for working expenses to £1,775 9d. 9d. To the outgoings, however, must be added a proportion of the establishment expenses for supervision and management, and £1,300, which has been paid to Messrs. Finch & Co., on account of contract for alterations and repairs to the lavatories and conveniences. In the early part of the year the conveniences were cleansed and painted, and certain repairs carried out, in addition to ordinary general repairs, at a cost of £65. The Vestry s attention was called during the year to the desirability of improving the sanitary condition of 97 these conveniences, and of carrying out certain works necessary to put the same in a sound and satisfactory state. Messrs. Finch & Co., the contractors who originally constructed the conveniences, submitted to the Vestry a detailed report and four alternative schemes for dealing with the question, including provision for increasing the lavatory accommodation for each sex. In consequence of the large number of persons who make use of the place, the Vestry felt that the time had arrived for the drainage and ventilation to be thoroughly overhauled, and that the lavatory accommodation undoubtedly required to be improved. The Vestry accordingly accepted the estimate of Messrs. Finch & Co, to re-model the system of drainage, re-polish the marble work, supply and fix automatic flush tanks, provide means of ventilation by air propellers, repave with encaustic mosaic, cover ceiling with lincrusta francaise, and extend the structure under the roadway so as to provide a lavatory room with seven basins and other conveniences for gentlemen, and a lavatory room with five basins for ladies for the sum of £1,562, subject to the necessary consent being obtained for extending the structure under the street, and to Messrs. Finch & Co. entering into a formal contract with the customary conditions, and undertaking to carry out the work in such a manner so as at no time to require the conveniences to be closed to the public. The consent to the extension of the structure under the street having been obtained, the works were put in hand and were in progress at Lady Day, 1894. URINALS.

Golden Square. Oxford Street, by the Pantheon. Piccadilly, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by Marlborough House. Regent Street, by Conduit Street. St. James's Square. 101 Fire escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly, and at the Fire Engine Station in Great Marlborough Street, and corner of Rathbone Place. Arrangements are also made for an escape to attend all tires during the daytime. MUSIC AND DANCING LICENSES. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the London County Council, notices were given to the Vestry in the month of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licenses, as follows:— Bratt, Edwin, The Swallow, 6 Swallow-street, for Music only. Bourke, Algernon Henry, Willis's Restaurant, 26, Kingstreet, St. James's-square, for Music only.

Among the Bills that have received attention during the year are the following:— Session 1893. Beer Adulteration. Employers' Liability (No. 2). Land Values (Taxation of Local Authorities). Local Government (England and Wales). London (Equalization of Rates). Margarine Act (1887) and Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875) Amendment. Public Health (London) Act (1891), Amendment. Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), &c., Amendment. Shop Hours Act (1892) Amendment (No. 2). Vaccination. Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment. Vestrymen's Qualification. Session 1894. Central London Railway (Extension of Time). London County Council (General Powers). London County Council (Improvements). London County Council (Tower Bridge Southern Approach). London County Council (Water). London Streets and Buildings. West Middlesex Water Works. The Vestry have taken action with regard to certain of these Bills, as follows:— 103 Petitioned against or otherwise opposed the Local Government (England and Wales) Bill; the London (Equalization of Rates) Bill; the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875) Amendment Bill; the Valuation (Metropolis) Amendment Bill; the Vestrymen's Qualification Bill; the London County Council (General Powers) Bill; and the London Streets and Buildings Bill. LONDON (EQUALIZATION OF RATES) BILL. As previously mentioned in the preceding paragraph the Vestry presented a petition to Parliament against the Bill introduced by the Government last year, having for its object the equalization of rates in the metropolis. The Vestry feel that the principle involved in this measure is of such great importance to the Parish of St. James, and its effect so little understood or appreciated by the Parishioners that they deem it desirable to reprint, for the information of the ratepayers, the following report on the Bill presented to the Vestry by the late Vestry Clerk:— The effect of this Bill on St. James's will be as follows:— The Parish will contribute to the Equalization Fund on thecc basis of rateable value. A rate of 6d. in the £ on the present rateable value of the Parish (745,090) will raise 18,627 The Parish will be entitled to a credit from the Equalization Fund on the basis of population. The population of London at last census was 4,232,118. The Fund will amount to £838,561 per annum. The population of St. James's was 24,995, so that the share to which St. James' will be entitled is24995/4232118 of £838,561 4,952 Net charge on the rates (equivalent to an addition of more than 4d. in the £ per annum) £13,675 104 The Bill has been introduced by the Government in consequence of a resolution passed by the House of Commons on the 24th February last as follows:— "That provision ought to be made for further equalizing the rates throughout the Metropolis." Assuming the Bill to be Bound in principle, the question arises why the London County Council should be called upon to collect and distribute the Fund, instead of the existing staff of the Local Government Board, which has been created to deal with the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, being utilized for the purpose. Would not economy result from one staff administering both funds? A still more important question is whether the money is to bo handed over to the receiving Parishes free from any control over its expenditure, or whether some control like that exercised by the Local Government Board over expenditure for purposes coming within the scope of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, should not bo adopted as a safeguard against extravagance. But, the vital question is whether the Bill is equitable. To the Memorandum prepared by Mr. Dethridge, Vestry Clerk of Paddington, to which reference was made at the Meeting of St. James's Vestry on the 25th May, I have added two columns showing the rate in the pound according to the most recent return, and the increase or decrease in the rates which would result from the Bill. If the intention of the Bill is to relieve Poor Parishes, it signally fails to accomplish its purpose. St Giles's, for instance, with a rate of 5s. 8d. in the pound, will pay into the fund more than it receives, while Islington, which has a rate of only 5s. 2¼d. in the pound, and is not usually classed as a poor parish, will receive the largest payment from it. As will be seen a little further on, the rates of St. Giles's will be increased by the Bill to 5s. 9½d. in the pound, while the rates of Islington will be reduced to 4s. 11¼dSeveral other parishes which will be benefitted by the Bill have a smaller pound rate than St. Giles's, and the anomaly is greater than appears on the surface, as the basis upon which the rate is levied is higher in Central London than in residential suburban districts, in consequence of the higher rents. A private house in Broad Street, Golden Square, which readily lets (say) at £90, would probably fetch no more than £65 if it 105 could be moved bodily to Islington. The rateable value on a rental of £90 is £75, and rates at 4s. in the pound on this sum would be £15. The rateable value on a rental of £65 is £55, and rates at 5s. 2¼d. on this would be £14 5s. 3¾d. Charges common to the Metropolis represent a rate of about 3s. 3d. in the pound, so that the ratepayer in St. James's not only pays a higher rent than he would have to pay for similar accommodation in Islington, but also contributes £12 3s. 9d. to the County Council, School Board, Asylums' Board, Common Poor Fund, Police, &c., compared with a contribution of £8 18s. 9d. by the Islington ratepayer. In other words, assuming the comparision of rental values in the two districts to be correct, the ratepayer in Broad Street, on a rate of ???s. in the pound, contributes £3 5s. 0d. more to Metropolitan charges than the ratepayer in Islington, having similar accommodation, and paying rates at 5s. 2¼d. in the pound. These contributions to common funds are gross payments, subject to repayments. Islington receives a larger repayment than St. James's, so that the net result is, in proportion, even more against St. James's than the foregoing figures would show. In either case, the ratepayer in St. James's with a rate of 4s. in the pound already pays more to Metropolitan Authorities, according to the accommodation afforded by his residence, than the ratepayer in Islington with a rate of 5s. 2¼d. Then, again, why does the workman employed in St. James's reside in Fulham or Lambeth, where the rates in the pound are so much higher? Simply becauso in spite of the nominally higher rates, the total burden of rent and rates in Fulham or Lambeth is so much lighter than in St. James's that it answers his purpose to incur the additional cost of travelling to and fro and suffer the inconvenience of living away from his work in order to get away from the parish which is said to have the blessing of low rates. The fact, is, the rates in central London are low because the basis of assessment is high. This aspect of the case is not only ignored by the Bill, but is always overlooked by the advocates of a theoretical equalization of rates. But a few figures clearly show that the Bill will not produce oven a theoretical equalization of rates. Thus, the present rateable value of Camberwell is £1,010,778, so that £20,727 the estimated net amount payable to that Parish under the Bill represents a rate 106 of more than 4¾d. in the pound. In Islington, £21,181 is equivalent to a rate of 3d. in the pound on its rateable value of £1,715,907. The rates in these two parishes—neither of which is usually reckoned a poor parish—will thus be reduced to a lower amount than the rates of some of the contributing parishes. The rates of Camberwell, for instance, would be reduced by the Bill to 5s. 7¼d. in the pound, and those of Islington to 4s. 11¼d.; while the rates of St. Giles's would be increased to 5s. 9½d., Paddington to 5s. 2¼d., St. James's to 4s. 4½d., Kensington to 5s. 4½., St. George, Hanover Square, to 5s., and the City to 5s. 1½d., all, with one exception, higher than those of Islington. Mr. Dethridge's Memorandum (with the addition to his table of the two columns above referred to) is as follows:— Briefly put, the proposal contained in the above-mentioned measure is that a new fund shall be established, to be called the "Equalization Fund," which is to be kept separate from the existing County Council Fund, but nevertheless placed under the management of the Council. The fund in question will be created by levying what is called the "equal sixpence" upon the rateable value of the metropolitan parishes amounting to £840,000, and will bo distributed by the Council among those parishes in proportion to the census population in their respective areas. These sums are to be applied, in the first place, to sanitary purposes, and, in the second place, to lighting; and if any balance should be left, which seems to be improbable, such balance is to be expended upon scavenging. It is hoped that the proposed equalization will not act as an inducement in regard to those parishes which are to receive a substantial "legacy" from the fund to incur lavish expenditure. Assuming that the average rateable value per head of the entire population in the administrative county of London, calculated upon the revised census of 1891 and the Valuation Lists in force on the 6th April, 1893, is £7 18s. 10¾d., and that the average rateable value per head of population in Paddington is £11 5s. 5½d., it follows that Paddington will have to pay under the proposed measure 6d. in the pound upon the difference of £3 6s. 6¾d., or about 1s. 8d. per head of its population, amounting to nearly £10,000, or an annual additional rate of 2d. in the pound. The undermentioned parishes will receive as nearly as possible the 107 following amounts, the three most populous, viz., Lambeth, Camberwell, and Islington, receiving the largest contributions:— Rate in £, 1892. £ d. 5/8 Streatham 51 Equal to rate of — 6 / 7½ Old Tower 79 „ 4½ 6/8 Old Artillery Ground 221 „ 6½ 5/9 St. Luke 334 „ 0¼ 6/3 Shadwell 388 „ 2 5/8 Penge 401 „ 0¾ 6/3 Tooting Graveney 437 „ 3¾ 6/9 Charlton 675 „ 2½ 6/1 Whitechapel 1,219 „ l½ 5/6 Stoke Newington 1,289 „ 1½ 5/4 Chelsea 1,303 „ 0½ 5/8 Ratcliff 1,338 „ 5 6/6 Mile End New Town 1,494 „ 1s. 0 5/10 Clapham 1,729 „ l½ 5/10 Lewisham 1,846 „ 1 6/10 Rotherhithe 2,208 „ 2½ 5/7 Wandsworth 2,255 „ 2 5/6 Christ Church, Spitalfields 2,323 „ 6¾ 6/8 Woolwich 2,566 „ 2¼ 6/3 Poplar 3,117 „ 2 6/2 Limehouse 3,152 „ 6½ 5 /10 Clerkenwell 3,978 „ 2 6/6 Greenwich 4,030 „ 3¼ 7/3 Bow 4,228 „ 6½ 5/5 St. George's-in-the-East 4,282 „ 5¼ 6/7 St. George the Martyr 4,888 „ 4 6/0 Hammersmith 5,669 „ 2½ 6/2 Plumstead 5,860 „ 7½ 7/4 Bermondsey 6,057 „ 3½ 6/9 Fulham 6,424 „ 3½ 5/5½ St. Pancras 6,750 „ 1 5/10 Shoreditch 7,589 „ 2¾ 5/8 St. Paul, Deptford 7,794 „ 4 7/5 Bromley 8,215 „ 8½ 5/9 Battersea 10,390 „ 3 6/- Newiugton 11,131 „ 5¾ 6/6 Mile End Old Town 11,955 „ 7½ 6/6¾ Bethnal Green 15,004 „ 8½ 108 £ d. 5/7 Hackney 15,060 Equal to rate of 3¾ 5/6 Lambeth 15,809 „ 2½ 6/- Camberwell 20,727 „ 4¾ 5/2¼ Islington 21,184 „ 3 The following parishes, including Paddington, will have to pay as nearly as possible the amounts set opposite their respective names:— Rate in the £, 1892. £ d 5 / 4 Deptford, St. Nicholas 18 Equal to rate of — 5/8 Norton Folgate 29 „ 0½ 6/3 Horselydown 105 „ 0½ 6/5 Kidbrooke 109 „ 1¼ 6/7 Lee 117 „ 0¼ 6/2 Eltham 164 „ 0¾ 5/2 Christ Church, Southwark 358 „ 0¾ 5/6½ St. Botolph Without, Aldgate 393 „ 2½ 6/3½ Putney 618 „ 1 5/3 Holborn, St. Andrew, and St. George the Martyr 586 0¾ 5/3½ St. Sepulchre 826 „ 4¼ 5/7½ Wapping 910 „ 4¼ 5/2 St. Anne, Westminster 1,168 „ 2 5/3 Saffron Hill 1,273 „ 3½ 5/1½ St. Paul, Covent Garden 2,046 „ 5 5 /10 St. Olave 2,301 „ 5¼ 5/8 St, Giles, including St. George, Bloomsbury 2,570 1½ 5/2 St. Saviour 2,851 „ 3 6/0 St. Clement Dane 3,417 „ 4 5 /3 Hampstead 4,170 „ 1½ 4/9 St. Margaret and St. John 8,423 „ 2¾ 4/11 St. Marylebone 9,777 „ 1½ 5/0½ Paddington 9,808 „ 2 4/10 St. Martin-in-the-Fields 10,201 „ 4¾ 4/- St. James, Westminster 13,662 „ 4½ 5/2½ Kensington 17,868 „ 2¼ 4/7½ St. George, Hanover Square 30,658 „ 4½ 4/8 The City 96,602 „ 5 But the foregoing figures do not exhaust the anomalies and inequalities which the Bill would cause, for by the operation of 109 Sub-section 4 and the proviso of Sub-section 6 of Clause 1 of the Bill, some parishes which would contribute to the Fund if they were self-contained sanitary districts will actually receive grants owing to their being joined with other parishes for sanitary purposes. Sub-section 4 of Clause 1 provides that "Where the aggre"gate of the contributions from the parishes in the district is less "than the grant apportioned to the district, the difference shall be "paid out of the Equalization Fund to the Sanitary Authority of "the district, and no payment towards any equalization charge "shall be required from any parish in the district." The proviso of Sub-section 6 is as follows:—"Provided that where "the district of such Sanitary Authority comprises two or more "parishes, the sum paid [from the Fund to a Sanitary Authority] "shall be apportioned among the parishes in proportion to their "population." If I correctly understand the effect of these two provisions, St. Botolph Without, Aldgate, Norton Folgate, Putney, Wapping, and other parishes, will receive grants from the Fund owing to their being combined with other parishes for sanitary (though not for rating) purposes, which, if they stood alone, would, as Mr. Dethridge's statement shows, actually contribute to the Fund, On the other hand, many parishes, notably Mile End New Town, will derive considerably less benefit from the Bill from forming part of a larger sanitary district, than if they were self-contained. A comparison of the following statement, relating to some of the combined sanitary districts, with the figures entered against the same parishes in Mr. Dethridge's statement will better illustrate this point.

The following private Bills promoted by the London County Council this Session received consideration at the hands of the Vestry:— London County Council (General Powers.) London County Council (Water Bill.) London County Council (Tower Bridge Southern Approach.) London County Council (Improvements.) London County Council (General Powers.) The General Powers Bill of the London County Council deals with a variety of subjects, such as regulating the closing of streets in London; the use of fire hydrants; the lighting of common staircases in tenement dwellings; byelaws as to the conveyance of explosives over the ferries of the London County Council; enforcement of the Ferry bye-laws; the protection of sewers; the arrangement of polling districts and polls at Vestry elections. By Clause 4 it is provided that no street shall be closed or stopped up by a Vestry or District Board during the execution of any paving, sewering, or other works unless with the previous sanction in writing of the London County Council, and subject to any conditions prescribed by such sanction. The clause also provides that if any street is so closed or stopped up without such sanction, or if any of the conditions imposed by the Council are not complied with, the persons responsible shall be liable to a penalty of not exceeding £20, and to a further penalty of not exceeding £5 per day during which such street shall continue closed either without the sanction of the Council or in contravention of any conditions they may impose. 113 This clause is practically an amendment to Section 84 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862, which makes it lawful for a local authority to close or stop up any street in their district with the previous sanction of the County Council. The Act of 1862, however, contains no provisions for enforcing any conditions laid down by the Council, neither does it enable the Council to prevent the closing or stopping up of streets without their sanction. It will be seen, therefore, that the proposed clause if carried into law will prevent local authorities stopping up streets over which they exercise jurisdiction except with the sanction of the County Council, and on such conditions as the Council may impose. This appears to be an unnecessary interference with the powers and duties of Vestries and District Boards as Highway Authorities, and it is rendered more objectionable by the fact that these bodies are to be penalised if they fail to comply with the provisions of the clause or any of the conditions which may be laid down by the Council. Clause 6 provides that the owner of any building designed for use in flats or tenements, in which any staircase or passage is used in common by occupants of different flats or tenements, and is open at night, shall be bound to light every such staircase or passage, and to keep the same lighted from sunset to sunrise on every night to the satisfaction of the Lighting Authority of the district. The Lighting Authority may, by an order under seal, prescribe the amount of light and the positions of any lights to be provided. The owner is to be liable to a penalty of £5 for every night on which he fails to comply with the provisions of the Section. The clause farther provides that the Lighting Authority may undertake the provision and maintenance of lamps and H 114 fittings, and the lighting and extinguishing of lamps on such erms as may be agreed upon with the owner of the premises. It is proposed by Clause 13 to authorise the Council by their officers to enter any premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether the provisions of the Bill relating to the protection of sewers are being contravened, and any person refusing such entry or obstructing any officer in carrying out his duties is liable to a penalty of £20. Clauses 15 to 20 contain provisions for the alteration and re-arrangement of Polling Districts, and by the 17th Clause it is provided that in dividing Electoral Divisions and Parliamentary Boroughs, or any division thereof, into Polling Districts, the districts shall be arranged in such manner so that every elector resident in any Electoral Division, Borough or Division of a Borough, shall be enabled to poll within a distance not exceeding one mile from his residence. No Polling District, however, need be constituted containing less than 300 such electors having votes at a Parliamentary Election for such borough. By Clause 21 it is provided that on the call of a poll for the election of a Vestryman under the Metropolis Local Management Acts there shall be an interval of not less than five clear days other than Sundays or public holidays, between the day on which the notice of poll is published, and the day of the taking of such poll. The Vestry were of opinion that some of the provisions contained in this Bill were objectionable, particularly those provided for by Clauses 13, 17, and 21, which the Vestry felt to be quite unnecessary. Communications were accordingly addressed to the London County Council, to Lord Wemyss, and to the Hon. W. F. D. Smith, M.P., calling attention to the Vestry's objections to the measure. 115 The Bill has been read a second time and referred to a Select Committee for consideration. London County Council (Water). This Bill, which would empower the London County Council by agreement to purchase or take on lease and hold lands and water rights, has been reported by the examiner as not complying with Standing Orders, London County Council. (Tower Bridge Southern Approach.) This Bill would empower the County Council to make a new approach to the Tower Bridge on the southern side of the Thames. The estimated expenditure on capital account for the purpose of the Bill is £436,000. The property proposed to be acquired is situated in the parishes of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, Bermondsey, and St. John, Horsleydown. The Vestry did not deem it necessary to take any action on this Bill. London County Council. (Improvements.) This Bill empowers the London County Council to carry out certain improvements and acquire lands for various purposes. By Clause 4, power would be given to the Council to alter and reconstruct the Bridge known as Highgate Archway and the approaches thereto in the Parishes of Islington and Hornsey, and in connection therewith to widen Hornseylane and Archway-road in the said parishes; and to widen Wood-lane in the parish of Hammersmith, at the southern end where it joins the Uxbridge-road. The Highgate Archway improvement is estimated to cost £28,000, of which the Ecclesiastical Commissioners are to contribute £1,000, and the remainder is to be borne in equal H 2 116 parts by the London County Council, the Middlesex County Council, the Hornsey Local Board, and the Vestry of Islington. In the event of the London Street Tramways Company constructing certain Tramways authorised by the London Street Tramways (Extensions) Act, 1888, they will be required to pay towards the cost of the Improvement the sum of £3,000. On the completion of this improvement the Archway is to be maintained and repaired by the Council as a County Bridge at the joint expense, in equal shares, of the Council and the Middlesex Council. The Wood Lane (Hammersmith) Improvement is estimated to cost £5,000, of which the Vestry of Hammersmith is to contribute one half. Clause 6 would enable the Council to purchase certain lands in various parishes for the purpose of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, Weights and Measures Offices, and Coroner's Courts and Mortuaries, but as none of the sites in question are situate in this Parish, there is no need to mention them in detail. Clause 43 proposes to empower the Council to purchase and take the garden in Lincoln's Inn Fields as an open space for the use of the public. The garden is at present maintained by Trustees under an Act passed in the eighth year of the reign of King George II., who are empowered to levy rates upon the owners and occupiers of certain houses therein specified to defray the cost of maintenance &c. The garden is presumably to be transferred to and vested in the Council in consideration of the abolition or concession of the said rates authorised to be levied by the Act of George II. 117 London Streets and Buildings Bill. This Bill, introduced by the London County Council to consolidate and amend the enactments relating to streets and buildings in London, proposed to repeal and re-enact by means of a private Bill, the substance of several Acts of Parliament, some of which are technically known as public Acts and others as private or local Acts. The Vestry are of opinion that it is very objectionable to entirely repeal a public and general Act of Parliament by means of a private Act; the subject of the proposed Bill, moreover, is of such importance to so large a community that the general convenience would, they think, be best served by the introduction of the Bill as a public Bill, and, if necessary, referred to a Select Committee instead of to a Committee of the whole House, for the consideration of the details A report by the Vestry's Surveyor on certain points which he considered required amendment in the Bill, which throughout is of a highly technical character, was forwarded to tho London County Council for their consideration. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT, 1894. The Bill introduced by the Government last Session for the creation of Parish Councils throughout the country passed into law and received the Royal assent on the 5th March last. The Act, as is generally known, was intended originally to apply to the provinces only, but an amendment was inserted in the Bill when it was under consideration by the House of Commons applying certain of its provisions to the Metropolis. So soon as the nature of this amendment became known the Vestry, through their Parliamentary Bills Committee, 118 addressed communications to the then President of the Local Government Board (Mr. Fowler), the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, and subsequently to Lord Wemyss, and the Hon. W. F. D. Smith, M.P., pointing out that not only would the subject of the amendment be more appropriately dealt with in the promised measure for the establishment of District Councils in London than in the Bill in question, but that legislation at the present time affecting the qualification and mode of election of Vestrymen, would probably lead to a comprehensive dealing with the question of Local Government, and the consolidation of local bodies in London, being indefinitely deferred. The provisions of the Act which affect London relate to the qualification of the electors and of the persons to be elected, and to the mode of conducting the election, and are very far reaching in their effect upon the present London Vestries and District Boards. The application of parts of the Act to London necessitate a number of cross references to various sections, and in addition, several sections of other Acts of Parliament are incorporated, thereby making the actual effect of the Act as regards London somewhat confusing. There are besides, two or three apparent anomalies in the Act, which would probably not have arisen had the London clauses formed the subject of a separate measure, and had mor time been given for their consideration. The following extracts from a Report made to the Vestry by the Vestry Clerk, show how the Act affects the present constitution and election of Vestries. Qualification of Electors. Up to the present time tho electors have been those persons who have been rated for twelve months, and were rated occupiers at the time of the election. In future, according to section 31 and sections 23 (3) and 2 (1), which are applied by the former 119 section, the electors are to be the persons whose names appear either in the local government register of electors or the parliamentary register of electors for the parish. Where a parish is divided into Wards the electors of each Ward are, according to sec. 23 (3) to be such of the parochial electors as are registered in respect of qualifications within the Ward. It appears from section 44 (2) that persons on the parliamentary register of electors for the County in respect of the ownership of property in the parish are to form part of the register of electors, and will, therefore, be entitled to vote at Vestry Elections. The persons entitled to vote, therefore, in future at Vestry elections, provided they are on the register of voters, may be summarised as follows:— a) Ratepayers (whether men or women) who have been in occupation of premises for twelve months to the 15th July prior to the election. (b) Tenement occupiers (men or women) in a dwelling house where the landlord does not reside, who have been in occupation for the period above named. (c) Lodgers (male) who have for the like period occupied lodgings of the clear yearly value, if let unfurnished, of £10 or upwards. (d) All male persons inhabiting a dwelling house or room by virtue of any office, service, or employment provided the house is not occupied by the person under whom such man serves. (e) Male owners of freehold property in the parish, provided they are not also registered as occupiers. With regard to the qualification of married women as electors, it is provided by sec. 43 that "A woman shall not be disqualified by marriage for being on any local government rogister of electors, or for being an elector of any local authority, provided that a husband and wife shall not both bo qualified in respect of the same property." Section 44 contains instructions as to the manner in which the register of parochial electors is to bo prepared. A question here 120 arises as to whether the first election, which is to be held in November next, will be conducted on the register of voters to be prepared during the coming summer, or on the register prepared last year. The register of voters to be prepared during the ensuing months does not come into operation until next year; and unless, therefore, the present registration law is altered before November, the first election in that month will take place on the old register with the result that, to be entitled to vote, electors must have been in occupation for twelve months prior to the 15th July, 1603; while any one who has left or altogether ceased his or her connection with the parish since the 15th July, 1893, will be entitled to vote, provided he or she is on the register. Qualification of Persons to be Elected. Section 23 (2), which is made applicable to members of Vestries and District Boards, and to auditors, by section 31, provides that a person shall not be qualified to be elected or to be a "councillor," unless ho is a parochial elector, or has during the whole of the twelve months preceding the election resided in the district, and that no person shall bo disqualified by sex or marriage for being elected or being a "councillor." The twelve months residential qualification inserted in this section was, I imagine, intended to provide for any persons who, being entitled to be on the register of electors, might have been inadvertently omitted from the list. Reading the words literally, however, several important questions are at once raised. For instance, although as previously mentioned a husband and wife cannot both be qualified as electors in respect of the same property, there does not appear to be anything to prevent a husband and wife as well as a large family of sons and daughters, provided they are of full age, from being elected on the Vestry if they have resided in the parish during the whole of the twelve months preceding the election. In fact, there is now practically no qualification needed for election as an administrator of the affairs connected with the local government of Metropolitan Parishes. The provisions relating to the disqualification of members are set our fully in section 46. A person is disqualified if he is an infant or alien; has received union or parochial relief within 121 12 months before his election, or since his election ; has within five years been convicted of any crime and sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour without the option of a fine, and has not received a free pardon ; been adjudged bankrupt, or made a composition or arrangement with his creditors during the time last stated ; holds any paid office, or is interested or concerned in any bargain or contract entered into with the Vestry. The same section provides that if any person acts when disqualified, or votes when prohibited under this section, he shall for each offence, be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20. Section 51 of the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855 which provides for a penalty of £50 for acting as a Vestryman when disqualified is repealed. Mode of Conducting the Election. The provisions of the Act relating to the conduct of elections are as before stated to apply to the London Vestries, and such elections are to be conducted according to rules to be framed by the Local Government Board (Sec. 23 (5.) If there is a poll it will have to be taken by ballot. The rules to be framed by the Local Government Board in relation to Elections are by section 48 to provide inter alia:— (a) For every candidate being nominated in writing by two parochial electors as proposer and seconder, and no more. (b) For preventing an elector at an election for a parish divided into parish wards from subscribing a nomination paper or voting for more than one ward. (c) For fixing or enabling the County Council to fix the day of the poll, and the hours during which the poll is to be kept open, so however, that the poll shall always be open between the hours of six and eight in the evening. (d) For the polls at elections held at the same date and in the same area being taken together, except where this is impracticable. (e) For the appointment of returning officers for the elections. The Elections (Hours of Poll) Act, 1885, which directs that the poll shall commence at 8 a.m., and close at 8 p.m., is applied to Vestry elections by Sec. 31 (1). 122 It is presumed that under Section 48, the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872, and the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and Sections 74 and 75 and Part IV. of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as amended by the last-mentioned Act (including the penal provisions of those Acts) are to apply, subject to certain alterations to be made by the rules, to be issued by the Local Government Board. By Section 48(4) the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, and the enactments amending the same, with respect to the expenses of elections, and to the acceptance of office resignation, re-eligibility of holders of office, and the filling of casual vacancies, are, subject to certain adaptations to be made by the said rules, to apply to elections of members of Vestries under the Metropolis Management Acts. Should any difficulty arise with respect to the holding of the first election, or should an election be defective or otherwise, or should any default occur in the election of Vestrymen or Auditors, the County Council are empowered (Sec. 48 (5) and Sec. 80 (1) to order a new election, or do anything which appears to them expedient for properly constituting the local authority. The expenses of any election are to be regulated by the County Council, and are not to exceed the scale fixed by the Council, and if at the beginning of one month before the first election the County Council have not framed a scale, the Local Government Board are empowered to frame such scale, which shall not be alterable until after the first election. I have not deemed it necessary to detail the provisions of the Ballot Act, 1872, the Municipal Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Practices) Act, 1884, and the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, which are applied to Vestry elections, as it is not known to what extent these may be varied or modified by the rules to be issued by the Local Government Board. Many of these provisions are very important, dealing, as they do, with the expenses of cand dates, the acceptance of office, resignation, casual vacancies, and other matters in connection with the election. The first election under the Act is, according to section 84, to take place on the 8th day of November next, or such later date 123 or dates in the present year as may be fixed by the Local Government Board. The persons elected are to come into office on the second Thursday next after their election, or such other day not more than seven days earlier or later as may be fixed by or in pursuance of the rules to be made by the Local Government Board. By Section 79 the duty is cast upon the Vestry of taking the necessary measures for the conduct of the first election, including the appointment of the returning officer. Under this section persons who are members of the Vestry at the passing of the Act (5 March) or are auditors are to continue in office until the day on which the members and auditors elected under the new Act come into office, notwithstanding any want of qualification, as if the term of office for which they were elected expired on that day. The meaning of the words "notwithstanding any want of qualification" as in this section is not quite clear, and I hesitatate therefore to express any opinion as to their effect. The annual election of Vestrymen and Auditors will, of course not be held as usual in May this year. Section 79 also provides that of the members first elected under the Act, one third shall go out of Office in May, 1896, one third in May, 1897, and the remainder in May, 1898. Sub-section 6 provides that the members who are to retire in 1896 and 1897 shall be determined according to their place on the poll at the election, those that are lowest on the poll retiring first. If there is no poll, or should there be an equality of votes, the order of retirement is to be determined by ballot conducted under the order of the Vestry. These provisions as to retirement apply separately to each ward. Apparently the dates for the annual election of Vestrymen remain unaltered, except as regards this year, but it should be noted that there will be no annual election in 1895. Miscellaneous Provisions. Section 31 provides that no person shall be ex officio Chairman of the Vestry, and the Rector therefore will, after the first election under the Act, cease to be Chairman by virtue of his office. The Rector and Churchwardens apparently continue to 124 be ex officio members. I use the word apparently as some little doubt appears to exist as to whether section 2 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, under which these gentlemen act as ex officio members is impliedly repealed. Sub-section (1) of sect. 23 says that "there shall be no ex officio or nominated members of the Urban Sanitary Authority." The question is does this apply to London Vestries ? If it does, then section 2 of Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, would be repealed as being inconsistent with it. The evident intention of the Government was, I think, that the Rector and Churchwardens should remain ex officio members in London, and as no mention is made of Churchwardens in the recently issued circular of the Local Government Board, I think it may be taken for granted that both the Rector and Churchwardens will remain as heretofore ex officio members of the Vestry. The Vestry, at their first meeting after the annual election, must elect a Chairman for the year, and, according to section 22, such Chairman, unless a woman or personally disqualified, will be by virtue of his office a justice of the peace for the County of London, but, before acting as such, he is to take the oaths required by law to be taken by a justice of the peace other than the oath respecting the qualification by estate. The auditors who, as before stated, are to remain in office in the same manner as Vestrymen until new auditors are appointed in November, will, in future, be elected under the same qualifications as those for Vestrymen, and will be subject to the same disqualifications (secs. 79, 31 and 46). With regard to the effect the Act will have upon the powers and duties of the Vestry, I would point out that section 33, which is made directly applicable to London, provides that the Local Government Board may, on the application of the Vestry, or of any representative body within the district, make an order conferring on the Vestry or some other representative body within the district the appointment of overseers and assistant overseers, the revocation of appointment of assistant overseers, any powers, duties or liabilities of overseers, and any powers, duties or liabilities of a Parish Council. Whether there are any powers or duties which the Vestry might with advantage seek to have placed upon 125 them under this Section I am not at the present moment prepared to say, as the question is a very intricate one, and requires very careful consideration. Certain provisions of various Acts of Parliament as set out in the second schedule to the Act are repealed by Section 89, as also is so much of any Act which is inconsistent with the Act under review. METROPOLITAN STREETS ACT. The Vestry received a communication in April, 1893, from the Commissioner of Police, forwarding a notice stating that an order had been submitted for the approval of the Secretary of State, directing that certain streets be deemed to be within the special limits of the 10th section of the above-mentioned Act. The effect of this order will be to prohibit in the streets specified therein the loading and unloading of coal, etc., between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., and to give additional powers to the police to regulate the traffic. The streets situate wholly or partly in this parish, mentioned in the notice, are Coventry Street, Piccadilly, Tichborne Street, New Bond Street, Jermyn Street, Shaftesbury Avenue, Pall Mall, Oxford Street, and Regent Street. POSTS IN VIGO STREET. The Bill promoted by the London County Council which had for its object the removal of certain obstructions in public thoroughfares, including the posts in Vigo Street, which at the date of the Vestry's last Annual Report was awaiting the third reading in the House of Commons, passed into law during the year, and the posts in Vigo Street were removed by the London County Council on 120 the 11th November, the site of the obstruction for the future to form part of the street, and to be maintained by the Vestry. In connection with the removal of this obstruction the Vestry widened the carriageway of Vigo Street, so as to be available for a double line of vehicular traffic throughout; paved the western end of the street with asphalte, and relaid the footway paving to the altered line, at a total cost of £300. OVERHEAD WIRES. In accordance with the Bye-Laws made by the London County Council under the London Overhead Wires Act, 1891 (referred to in the last Annual Report of the Vestry), the Vestry in August last called the attention of the several Companies owning overhead wires in the Parish to the duty cast upon them of furnishing the Vestry as the Local Authority with particulars of all their overhead wires and of the penalty which they wero incurring by withholding the particulars so long after the date specified in the Byelaws. In response to this application the Vestry received particulars from most of the Companies owning wires, but considerable difficulty existed in getting the required particulars from the Companies in question in consequence of the large number of overhead wires and attachments which for some time past have been carried through the Parish. As required by the Bye-laws before mentioned the Vestry have approved the samples of insulators, attachments to buildings, &c., submitted by the National Telephone Company and the District Messengers' Service and News Company. 127 PARISH CHURCH CLOCK. The attention of the Vestry having been called to the necessity of repairing the Parish Church Clock, and believing the clock to be a public convenience even more than a want of the Church the Vestry voted the sum of £20, the estimated cost of the Work. OBSTRUCTIONS. The Vestry's attention was called daring last summer, by. a ratepayer, to the obstruction in Regent Street, between Piccadilly and Jermyn Street, caused by the loading and unloading of carriers' vans. The Vestry, however, after giving the subject careful consideration, came to the conclusion that the only action they could take in the matter was to inform the complainant that the Vestry had already communicated with the Polico as the authority for regulating traffic and traffic obstruction, and the Commissioners of Woods as freeholders of the property, on the subject, and that, while sympathising with him, they regretted that they were not able to afford him any remedy. MARLBOROUGH STREET POLICE COURT. In April last year the attention of the Vestry was called to a report that a suggestion to abolish Marlborough Street Police Court was under the consideration of the Government. The Vestry Clerk at once placed himself in communication with The Hon. W. F. D. Smith, M.P., the Member of Parliament for the Borough of the Strand, and the Home Secretary on the subject. The result was that a question was asked of the Home Secretary by Mr. Smith in the House of Commons as to the correctness of the rumour, when the 123 Home Secretary stated that there was certainly no intention of at present abolishing the Marlborough Street Police Court, and that he was in communication with the Treasury with regard to the appointment of additional magistrates, but that no final decision had been come to. On hearing the reply which had been given by the Home Secretary, the Vestry instructed the Vestry Clerk to write to that gentleman conveying an expression of the Vestry's opinion that the requirements of the district, owing to its peculiar circumstances, necessitate the retention of the Court, and that the continued growth of the population and the tendency to confer upon Police Courts jurisdiction in indictable offences amply justify tho appointment ot one or two additional magistrates for the London Police Courts. PRICE OF GAS. In August last the Vestry received a communication from the Vestry of St. Luke's inviting them to appoint three delegates to a conference to be held at the Vestry Hall, City-road, to take into consideration generally the question of the increased charge for gas made by the Gas Light and Coke Company, when Mr. W. Jenkins, Mr. McDonald, and Mr. Frohlich were appointed to represent the Vestry. The following resolutions were passed by the Conference:— (1) That all gas supplied in the Metropolis to private consumers, should be supplied at a uniform charge per 1,000 feet, with the free use of meters. (2) That a Parliamentary enquiry should be instituted into the present management and working of Gas Companies. (3) That the delegates to this conference wait upon the President of the Board of Trade in support of the foregoing resolutions, and (4) That Vestries and District Boards be requested to support the action of the conference. 129 These resolutions were referred by the Vestry to their Parliamentary Bills Committee, and on the recommendation of that Committee the Vestry decided to support the conclusions arrived at by the Conference. Further letters on the subject were received in March last from the Guardians of the Holborn Union, the Vestry of Stoke Newington, and the Board of Works for the Holborn District, when the Vestry informed these bodies of the resolution previously arrived at by them on the subject. FIRE INSURANCE. A communication was received by the Vestry in March last from the London County Council asking for certain particulars relating to certain irrecoverable property belonging to the Vestry in this Parish and enquiring whether the Vestry would be willing to co-operate with the Council in a system of mutual fire insurance. The Vestry furnished the Council with the particulars asked for, but saw no reason for disturbing the existing arrangements made by them for insuring their property, and accordingly informed the Council that they were not prepared to co-operate with them in the matter. USE OF FIRE HYDRANTS FOR FLUSHING AND OTHER PURPOSES. At the invitation of the London County Council the Vestry in November last appointed Mr. Bonthron to represent them at a conference between the Fire Brigade Committee of the Council, the Water Companies, and the Local Authorities, with a view to framing clauses for I 130 insertion in a Bill to bo promoted by the Council in the next session of Parliament to authorise the use of Fire Hydrants for flushing and other purposes. At the conference in question, which was held on the 17th November, a general, although not unanimous, opinion was expressed that it would be an advantage for hydrants to be used for the purposes suggested. Several questions as to responsibility, etc., were, however, raised as to which the Council thought it better to ascertain the views of the several local authorities. The Vestry, after giving the subject careful consideration, informed the Council, in reply to their enquiries, that they would prefer to continue to use independent means of obtaining water for flushing and other purposes, rather than incur the unknown liability attaching to the use of hydrants furnished for fire extinction purposes, and suggested that if the Council contemplate applying to Parliament to authorise the use of fire hydrants for further public purposes, the proposed legislation should take the form of enabling the Council, any local authority, and the Water Company concerned, to enter into an agreement authorising the local authority to use any hydrant or hydrants on such terms as may be mutually agreed. PROPOSED ERECTION OF DWELLINGS BY THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. With reference to the question of the erection of Working Class Dwellings in connection with the various improvements carried out by the Council, the Vestry of the Liberty of the Rolls transmitted to this Vestry a copy of a resolution passed by them, protesting against the erection by the 131 Council out of money raised by rates of any buildings for occupation that will not be self-supporting, aud pay an adequate percentage on the outlay, considering the burden on the Ratepayers at the present time heavy enough without embarking on schemes of philanthropy. The Vestry agreed with the views of the Vestry of the Liberty of the Rolls and addressed a communication to the London County Council on the subject to the effect that, while they understood that the Council had already decided not to erect certain buildings for occupation as dwellings except under conditions similar to those mentioned by the Vestry of the Liberty of the Rolls, they were of opinion that for more than one reason it was desirable that those conditions should apply to every future proposal for the erection of dwellings at the cost of the rates. In reply to this communication the Council called the Vestry's attention to a resolution passed by the Council in March 1893, requiring that buildings to be erected by the Council for dwellings shall be designed so as to provide a net return of not less than 3 per cent. PROPOSED BYE-LAWS FOR GOOD RULE AND GOVERNMENT OF LONDON. In March last the Vestry received a communication from the London County Council, forwarding copy of a report containing information relating to general bye-laws which have been adopted in certain Towns and Counties for the good rule and government of the same, and asking the Vestry to favor the Council with suggestions as to subjects on which it seemed to them that bye-laws might usefully be made for London. I 2 132 The Vestry, in reply, informed the Council that in their opinion bye-laws might usefully be made by the Council, applicable to the whole County of London, dealing with the following subjects:— Storage of Gunpowder. Petroleum. The erection of signboards or other projections more than 12 inches from the face of walls. Control of street musicians. CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them iu the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish.

Report on Articles Analysed during year 1893 233 197 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, for the year 1893. The figures given by the Census of 1891 showed that the resident population in St. James's then numbered 24,993, the District of the parish of St. James's covering an area of 162 acres. Taking the population at 24,993 for the year 1891, that would be an average of 154 22 persons per acre against 184 per acre in 1881. The Census of 1891 gave the mean density of the population in Registration London as 565 persons per acre. The position of St. James's as the shopping centre for the best retail trade of the west end of London makes the District more and more a city of luxurious shops, hotels, club', and lodging houses. Increasing facilities for travel to the suburbs, and the increasing value of premises in St. James's, necessitate its utilization for business purposes during the day, and its comparative desertion at night. The crowds of persons who buy and sell in Regent Street Bond Street, aud Piccadilly, and in the network of 198 ing streets, and the workers who are auxiliary to the scrvice of its famous shops now live in large part in the suburbs. Its resident population of 25,000 persons is, therefore, an inadequate exponent of the activity of its daily life, of the importance of its retail trade, and of the necessity for active sanitation. An outbreak of small-pox or of cholera, localized in St. James's, would at once so damage the trade of the district as to inflict upon its ratepayers a thousand times the cost which is now incurred by their preventive sanitary service, and by the prompt removal of infectious cases to suburban Hospitals as is now done. During the year 1893 the following numbers of deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's:— First Quarter 103 Second Quarter 98 Third Quarter 77 Fourth Quarter 101 Deaths in St. James's during the four quarters of the year 1893 379 To these Deaths there have to be added the deaths in outlying institutions among persons reported as belonging to St. James's 136 515 Deduct deaths of persons reported as Non-Parishioners:— Dying in the Union-House 33 Dying in the Throat Hospital 6 Dying elsewhere 6 — 45 Net Mortality of St. James's for the year 1893 470 199 In a population of 24,993, 470 deaths amount to a death-rate of 18 80 for each 1,000 persons living. During the year 1893, 28 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Twenty-two inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 21 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room adjoining the Mortuary. The following table gives a summary of the certified causes of death among persons dying in outlying institutions, but reported as having come from the district of St. James's, Westminster:— Abscess 1 Atrophy 1 Brain Disease 16 Bronchitis 9 Broncho-Pneumonia 3 Cancer 7 Convulsions (Puerperal) 1 Cyst (Abdominal) Ruptured 1 Diphtheria 9 Dysentery 1 Enteritis 2 Epilepsy 1 Gout 2 Haemorrhage (Puerperal) 1 Heart Disease 10 Hyper-Pyrexia 1 Intestinal Obstruction 2 Kidney Disease 9 Liver Disease 1 Neuritis 1 Paralysis 1 Phthisis 29 200 Pleurisy 1 Pneumonia 10 Prostatic Disease 1 Pyaemia 1 Scarlet Fever 2 Small Pox 1 Spinal Disease 1 Syncope 1 Typhoid Fever 2 Violent Deaths:— Fall Downstairs 1 Fall from a Van 1 Run over by Cart 1 Fall downstairs (Fractured Ribs) 1 Scalded 1 Run over by Van 1 Hysterectomy (a surgical operation performed at the Women's Hospital, Soho Square) 1 — 7 136 Against, the above deaths, as affecting the true mortality of St. James's, should be set the deaths of strangers who die in hotels and lodging-houses— many of whom have come to London for medical advice and treatment. A very large number of such hotels and lodging-houses exist in St. James's, but the precise number of the deaths among such visitors is not known. Such deaths, occurring in the district and known to be of persons not belonging to St. James's, have been brought into account in the summary at page 198. 201 The following Table shows the periods of life in which the deaths in St. James's have occurred in the last Seven years respectively.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1893, MADE TO THE Vestry of St. James's, Westminister, BY JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health and public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, During the year 1893, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 83 samples were examined, all which were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. In none of these samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. Among the samples submitted for examination, there have been the following:— Milk 32 Vinegar 24 Butter 12 Coffee 7 Cocoa 4 Arrowroot 3 Wine 1 83 234 Of the Milk samples, 5 were adulterated with water and the vendors prosecuted and fined (see Table); and 5 were found very poor, the vendors of these were warned by letter from the Vestry Clerk. Of the Vinegar samples, 4 contained less than 4 per cent. of real Acetic Acid (C2H402); their vendors were warned that these Vinegars were too weak. No. 57 was certified as containing 22 per cent. of added water; the vendor was prosecuted, but acquitted. The accuracy of the analysis made in St. James's was fully admitted, but the defence turned upon what standard should be taken for vinegar. The magistrate decided that the weakest vinegar might possibly contain only 3 per cent. of Acetic Acid, and the defendant was thereupon acquitted. In vinegar No. 74, free Sulphuric Acid (.1275 per cent.) was found. In my opinion, the addition of Sulphuric Acid to Vinegar is a fraudulent and injurious act, but, owing to the uncertain state of the law, and the fact that the old Vinegar Act allowed for excise purposes one thousandth part by weight of Oil of Vitriol to exist in vinegar, I did not advise a prosecution. The vendor of this vinegar was warned. The question of prosecuting will be reconsidered in the event of free Sulphuric Acid being again found in Vinegar. Upon the Law relating to the Sale of Vinegar containing Sulphuric Acid, the following report was made to the Sanitary Committee by Harry Wilkins, Esquire, Barristerat-Law, Clerk to the Vestry of St. James. "Apart altogether from statute law, a purchaser has a right to obtain the article for which he pays the price. If any article of food, or used in the preparation of food, is sold in such a 235 state, whether arising from adulteration or decomposition, as to be injurious to the health of the purchaser, the vendor subjects himself, not only to a civil action for damages, but also to the liability of an indictment. "Statute law relating to adulteration may be roughly divided into two classes:— "(1.) Restrictions imposed for the purposes of Revenue; and "(2.) Acts passed for the protection of the purchaser from fraud. "Prosecutions under Acts of Parliament falling within the former of these two classes can only be undertaken by officers appointed by the Government, while Acts of the second class are administered by Local Sanitary Authorities, such as the Vestry, and proceedings can be maintained under them by private individuals, independently of the Vestry altogether. It is only with these last-mentioned Acts that the Committee need trouble themselves. "For all practical purposes the law relating to adulteration, so far as concerns Local Authorities, has been codified in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, although they are supplemented in the Margarine Act, 1887, and one or two other Acts. Offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts may, for the purpose of this report, be classified under three heads:— "(1.) The fraudulent addition of a substance injurious to health; "(2.) The fraudulent abstraction of an ingredient; and “(8.) The sale, even without any allegation of fraud, of an article not of the nature, substance, or quality demanded by the purchaser. "The sale of Vinegar containing Sulphuric Acid might come under cither the first or third of these principal heads; but it is clear that to support a prosecution for an offence of the first class the evidence must be stronger and more direct than in the case of a prosecution under the third head. The 3rd Section of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, imposes a penalty, for tho first offence, of £50 upou any person who mixes any article of food with any ingredient or material so 236 as to render the article injurious to health, with intent that the same may be sold in that state; and a similar penalty is imposed on any person selling such article. The 5th Section, however, exempts from the penalty any person who proves that he did not know of the article being so mixed, and that he could not. with reasonable diligence, have obtained that knowledge. It will be seen that, not only must the article have been rendered injurious to health, but also that intent to sell in the mixed state must be proved if the manufacturer is proceeded against, and that the actual vendor can set aside the prosecution by proving absence of knowledge, and that he could not reasonably obtain such knowledge. A prosecution under the 3rd Section should, therefore, not be lightly undertaken. "Turning to the third class of offence, it may be remarked that, if a purchaser asks for vinegar, and receives, without notice from the vendor, vinegar plus sulphuric acid, he no more obtains an article of the nature demanded than a purchaser who asks for milk and receives milk and water, unless, indeed, the presence of sulphuric acid is a necessary or a customary result of the manufacture of vinegar. From the fact that the Vinegar Act (58 Geo. III., cap. 65), which was a Revenue Act and is now repealed, permitted the presence of a small percentage of sulphuric acid, I infer that it was, and perhaps is, customary for makers of vinegar to sharpen the acidity of their article by the addition of sulphuric acid, and that the presence of a small quantity of this acid was not regarded as harmful to the consumer. If the Committee contemplate undertaking a prosecution for the sale of Vinegar containing Sulphuric Acid, the safest course would be to take proceedings under the 6th Section of the Act of 1875—that is, for the sale of an article not of the nature demanded by the purchaser, which would not necessitate proof that the sulphuric acid was added to the vinegar, but would throw upon the vendor the onus of proof hat sulphuric acid is a usual ingredient of commercial vinegar. At the same time, it would be prudent for the Committee to satisfy themselves that sulphuric acid is not a usual ingredient of commercial vinegar before deciding to take any proceedings at all. "HARRY WILKINS, “Vestry Clerk. "20th January, 1894." 237 Of the 12 samples of Butter, 1 was found to contain 90 per cent. of Margarine; the vendor of this butter was prosecuted and fined; the 11 other samples were pure butters. Of the 4 samples of Cocoa, 2 contained respectively 50 per cent. and 40 per cent of potato starch. The first of these samples was labelled “Sold as a Mixture," and was therefore unassailable; the vendor of the second sample was warned. The 2 other samples were genuine. The 3 samples of Arrowroot were genuine. The sample of Claret, labelled “Grand Vin Margaux,” was found to be very acid and to contain some deposit, but no evidence of adulteration was discovered. No money or consideration, other than the stipend paid by the Vestry, has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 29, Dover Street, Piccadilly. 238 Table of 83 Samples submitted for examination during the year 1893.
