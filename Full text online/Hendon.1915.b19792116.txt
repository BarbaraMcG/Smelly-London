HENR 7 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Sanitary Condition OF The Rural District of Hendon, FOR THE YEAR 1915, BY R. LESLIE ROMER, M.R.C.S , Eng., L R C.P , Lond., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Hendon: Warden & Co., Ltd., Printers, "Hendon and Finchley Times" Office, 71, Church Road, Hendon, N,W, The Rural District of Hendon, —♦— Area, 11,055 Acres. Population, Census 1911, 14,161. Estimated Population, 1915, 16,603. Me. Chairman and Gentlemen,— I have the honour of presenting you my Annual Report upon the sanitary condition of your District. It is the 21 Last of the new series', and covers the year 1915. This report has been drawn up mainly on the lines of those of the past years, but owing to the war, in the question of figures, it has not been considered practicable to adhere strictly to former methods. The estimated population has not been arrived at in the manner of previous years, when the census returns have been used as a basis for the figures. Instead, the Registrar-General has forwarded me his estimation, which I understand has been deduced with the help of the National Register. It follows that no comparisons can be drawn between the death-rates of this year and those of the past years, all continuity having been broken, and therefore in this respect I have not alluded to the latter figures. With regard to births and birth rate, I have been requested to base the birth rate for 1915 upon the existing estimates of total population for 1914. Here again, all comparison with the figures of previous years has been omitted, as it would be quite useless. 4 SECTION 1. AREA AND GENERAL, DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICT. Typography The area, of the District is 11,055 acres. It lies upon the' southern and western slopes of the spur of high land running from the Barnet District and jutting out into the Weald of Harrow. The dividing lines of the five parishes run approximately north and .south, the northern portion of the parishes resting on the hill and the southern lying in. the valley. The highest point in the District, 502 feet above Ordnance datum, is on the Watford Road at the Hertfordshire boundary. The lowest point, about 150 feet, is to be found at the south-east corner of Pinner Parish. The, District is distinctly a residential one, being somewhat heavily timbered, and has a very small acreage of arable land. The agricultural portion of it is laid down in grass, and the chief agricultural product is hay. Running from east to wiest, the parishes' oome in the following order:—Edgware, Little Stanmore, Great Stanmore, Harrow Weald, Pinner. Geology The District lies upon the great London clay bed, which is capped on the higher land by patches of gravel of varying thickness. In some places, notably in the north-east corner of Harrow Weald, the subsoil water rises to within a foot or eighteen inches of the surface of the gravel. Public Open Spaces Besides the Stanmore Cricket Ground (seven acres), Stanmore Marsh (14 acres), the Little Common, Stanmore (6£ acres), and the Pinner Beds (10 acres), the principal oommon lands are those of Harrow Weald and Great Stanmore. The area of the former is 34¾ acres, of the latter 121½ acres. 5 SECTION 2. The estimated population of the district is 16603. BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE, There were 286 births registered in the district, one of which was illegitimate. To these are added 5 more, 3 of them being illegitimate, sent me by the Registrar General, giving a total of 291. This number is definite decrease on that of last year, the total then being 337. The corrected birth rate, estimated as already explained upon the population for 1914, is 18.43; the uncorrected, that is, the rate of those actually registered in the district, estimated by the same method, is 18.11. DEATHS AND DEATH RATE. The number of deaths registered in the district was 104; the number was 120 last year. There were 6 deaths of nonresidents registered in the district, and 31 deaths of residents occurred outside the district. After adding the residents to the number actually registered, and deducting the nonresidents, the corrected number is 129, and the death rate 7.76. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 30 deaths, namely:—Phthisis 11, Bronchitis 4, Pneumonia 13, and other diseases of the respiratory organs, not classified, 2. Principal causes of death Clancer caused 15 deaths, all being residents of the district. The ages and sex were:— Male: 47, 79, 53, 67, 70, 59, 43.-7. Female: 84, 81, 67, 57, 52, 61, 58, 45.-8. Last year there were 7 male and 15 female deaths from this disease. 6 INFANTILE MORTALITY. I am glad to say that the number of deaths of in.fa.nts under one year has fallen to the small total of 6, a very happy decrease on that of last year, which was 17. This year's death rate is therefore only 20.6; last year it was 50.4. This comparison is included as in previous years, as this rate is not based upon the estimated population, but upon the nett births of the district. PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Deaths for this year under the above heading total 8, giving a death rate of 0.40. Last year the number was 6. The total of 8 is accounted for as follows:— Enteric Fever, 1, Measles 2, Scarlet Fever 1, Diphtheria 1, Influenza 2, and Erysipelas' 1. SECTION 3. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. There were 98 easels of infectious diseases notified as having occurred in the district. The same number were notified last year. This total does not include any cases occurring amongst soldiers or sailors in the district, of which there were 3; 2 of these were Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and one Cerebrospinal Meningitis. This latter case was one of a Driver in the Royal Field Artillery, from Borden Camp, and unfortunately proved fatal within a very short, time. Of the 98 cases, 10 were Diphtheria, 4 Erysipelas, 64 Scarlet Fever, 3 Enteric, 1 Puerperal Fever, 14 Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and 2 of other forms of Tuberculosis. Diphtheria Of the 10 eases of Diphtheria, 7 occurred in Pinner, and one in each of the following districts: Edgware, Great Stanmore, and Harrow Weald. 7 Of the 64 cases of Scarlet Fever, 5 came from Edgware, Scarlet Fever 3 from Little Stanmore, 17 from Great Stanmore, 16 from Harrow Weald, and 23 from Pinner. As last year, there were three cases of Enteric Fever Enteric notified, one, I regret to say, a case of a young child, proving Fever fatal. In each case the' source of infection was undoubtedly from without the district. There were 14 .case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified Tuberculosis this year, exclusive of 2 military cases, mention of which has already been made. Last year the number was 17. Of the 14 cases, 4 were removed to Sanatoria, or hospital, the remainder receiving outside treatment under Dr. Munro, the Medical Officer in charge of the various dispensaries for treatment of the disease in the District. There were also 2 cases of other forms of Tuberculosis, both of which received outside treatment. All cases are visited on receipt of notification by the Sanitary Inspector, and disinfectants left, together with leaflets setting forth the necessary precautions to be adopted to prevent the spread of infection. All contacts are kept undeer observation, and, in addition, your Council allows the free examination of sputum for those unable to pay for it. On the termination of a case' owing to death or removal to hospital, the room and bedding are thoroughly disinfected. SECTION 4. This year 107 new houses have been built in the district. Housing Last year the number was 156, and the previous year 91. AccommodaThere have also been erected a. Railway Station, a Church, and a School in Pinner, and a Chapel in Edgware. The 107 new houses are divided amongst the district as follows:— Edgware 3 Harrow Weald 6 Little Stanmore 0 Pinner 86 Great Stanmore 12 8 Sewage Disposal The effluent from each of the Sewage Farms continues to be of a satisfactory character, and the number of samples tiaken have proved on analysis to be of a standard of purification which shews that there is no pollution of the streams into which the effluent is discharged. Pinner Disposal Works No large alterations have been made, but the areation arm has been extended, and generally the Farm is in fair condition although greatly taxed during heavy rainfall by the influx of storm and subsoil water. The. construction of the two new tanks have proved a great success, and the two tanks which were adjacent to the road having been filled up, the nuisance from smell has been removed. Great Stanmore Works The effluent discharged from this Farm is apparently consistently good, but the construction of an additional filter would be of great service. Edgware and Little Stanmore No alteration of importance has been made at this Farm, and the effluent generally appears to be satisfactory. Overcrowding Two cases of overcrowding occurred in Great Stanmore; both have been abated. Common Lodging Houses There are no Common Lodging Houses in the District. Byelaws are in force. Movable Dwellings Thirty-two caravans were inspected this year, 27 being in connection with Pinner Fair, and 5 in the Little Stanmore Parish. A wooden hut, not movable, was found to have been erected and in occupation, on the refuse tip, Bacon Lane, Little Stanmore. After various interviews with the owner and occupiers, this hut was closed. 9 Almost every house in the district is supplied by the Water Colne Valley Water Company. Theirs has been a good and SuPP'y plentiful supply of water throughout the year, and no complaints have been received. There are 8 Licensed Slaughterhouses in the District. SlaughterOne contravention of the bye-laws was difcovered and House remedied. The Middlesex County Council carries out this Act. Food and Drugs Act There are 30 persons on the Register who between them Dairies cowhave 537 milch cows, 40 cowsheds, and 34 dairies and milk- sheds, and shops. There were 85 inspections made of the cowsheds, and Milksilps 77 of the dairies, milk stores and milks-hops. There were 6 contraventions of the Byelaws discovered, all of which were remedied; also 2 oases of persons unregistered. This matter has given rise to a good deal of trouble collection during the past' year. Owing to the war, the Council and Disposal decided to make a half-yearly contract for the work, the half- Refuse year ending September 30th. Up to that date the cost of the work was as follows:—To contractors, £429; disinfectant powder, £5 18s. 4d. The work was satisfactorily done, except in Pinner; up to September 30th, 129 written complaints as to non-removal of the rubbish had been received from that parish, and numerous verbal complaints. After consideration, the Council in September decided to accept tenders for the continuation of the work in Edgware, Little Stanmore:, Great Stanmore, and Harrow Weald, at a cost of £225, but as far as Pinner was concerned not to accept the one tender which was sent in for that parish, but to make direct arrangements for the carting, etc., themselves. Owing to shortage of labour, the matter has been one of great difficulty, but I am glad to say that this difficulty has been largely overcome. Mr. Webb informs me that up to the time of writing no further complaints have been received. 10 Before leaving this subject I feel it my duty to say that the assistance which we rightly expect from individual householders at this time of stress has, in very many cases, not been forthcoming. Notices have been circulated all over the district requesting all persons to dispose of their own refuse by burning, wherever possible, and to only deposit in their dustbins the rubbish they were quite unable to get rid of themselves ; but I have recently observed that half the rubbish collected is of a combustible nature, which fact forces me to the conclusion that very little effort, is being made to lessen the amount of labour required in this direction. Twelve new sanitary dustbins have been provided. Nuisances There have been 212 inspections made under the House and Town Planning Act. The total number of inspections made is 1,385; of re-inspections, 1,734; 363 cautionary notices, and 12 statutory notices were served. Most of the defects found were dealt with under the Nuisance Clauses of the 1875 Act, or by letter and interview. One house was closed in Edgware under Section 17 of the 1909 Act, and one house in Little Stanmore and two in Harrow Weald were closed by the owners rather than carry out the alterations and repairs required by the Council. Under this heading also come the following:—46 waterclosets improved; 119 drains tested and examined; 81 drains cleaned and repaired and 4 re-constructed; 4 cesspools cleaned and repaired; 196 accumulations of refuse removed; 23 foul ditches cleansed; 6 piggeries cleansed; 61 cases of dampness remedied, and 9 yards repaired or paved. Also several new sinks and water-closets have been constructed. Nuisances have been dealt with arising from the shooting of large deposits of garden refuse on vacant land; also in one case from a large accumulation of manure. I visited and reported to you upon: (1) Two cottages at The City, Harrow Weald; (2) a cottage in Edgware; (3) the six cottages in the Upper Square, Stanmore; (4) Grove Cottages, Pinner; (5) 11 a field in Pinner in connection with the accumulation of manure just alluded to; and (6) the wood adjoining Sir John Rees' property, Stanmore. The River Pinn is once again giving cause for complaint, and on this matter the Council are in communication with the County Council. A stream in Hale Lane, Edgware, was found to be polluted with sewage, and the matter remedied. Also the footpath in Edgware running from Stanmore to The Hale has on various occasions required cleansing, owing to the fact that it is much used by tramps. Notice-boards have also been put up on the gates. In Little Stanmore the sewers in the High Street have been surcharged on various occasions, flooding the cellars. In each case the matter was remedied, but in heavy rains it is impossible to prevent the occurrence, as it is an old sewer with many fresh water gullies leading into it. There are 29 Registered Factories and Workshops in the Factories and district to which 76 visits of inspection have been paid, and Workshops seven contraventions of the Act found and dealt with. The usual method of disinfection of houses has been Infectious followed, the bedding being sent, to the Isolation Hospital Disinfection*1 for treatment in the steam apparatus. There were 157 rooms disinfected, 11 of these being after tubercular diseases ; 20 rooms were stripped, and either limewashed or papered. The method of disinfection is as follows : The rooms and furniture are sprayed with Formalin, and further fumigated with Formalin tablets, and the bedding treated as above noted. Disinfectants are given to the occupiers of infected houses, for use in washing down the rooms, etc. 12 Edgware Congregational Chapel This chapel was closed during the year: permission therefor was obtained from the Home Office for the removal of 9 bodies from the graveyard to the Hendon Cemetery. This work was satisfactorily carried out. The sanitary tables at the end of this report have been compiled by Mr. Johnson, your Sanitary Inspector, who has given, me every assistance. The work becomes heavier every year in the district, but in spite of this he discharges his duties admirably, for which I am very grateful. SECTION 5. SMALLPOX ACCOMMODATION. We have now a satisfactory arrangement with the Willesden Urban District Council to take in any cases of Smallpox which may occur in our district, but I am thankful to say that we have up to the present had no occasion to make Use of it. SECTION 6. ISOLATION HOSPITAL AND ACCOMMODATION. Cases 67. Death 1. The accommodation of this hospital consists of 26 beds and cots. During the past year 67 cases were treated; last year the number was 92. I am sorry, to say that one death occurred, from Diphtheria. Of the 67 cases, 51 were Scarlet Fever, and the remaining 16 Diphtheria. Of the Scarlet Fever cases, 8 were complicated by a secondary disease, measles in each case. Of the 51 cases of Scarlet Fever, 11 remained over from 1914, and of the 16 cases of Diphtheria, 3 remained, making a total for the past year of 53 fresh cases, 40 being Scarlet Fever, and 13 Diphtheria. 13 During the past year, owing to a sudden rise in the num ber of Scarlet Fever oases, we were unable to accommodate them all in our hospital, and were obliged to rely upon outside help. As lately this has been of frequent occurrence, it was finally decided to make fresh provision to meet the growth of the district. This was done by taking over the original Diphtheria Wards for Scarlet Fever, so that the whole of the original building will be given up to this latter dissase. A new Diphtheria block has been constructed by Mr. Webb cut of a temporary ward: it contains male and female wards, kitchen, and all necessary sanitary arrangements. This has been erected at a, small cost only; as soon as it is connected to the administrative block by telephone it will be ready for use Meanwhile, theire being at the present. time not many cases of Scarlet Fever, the old Diphtheria wards are still being used. I am most grateful to Mr. Webb, our Surveyor, for his skillful assistance in this, and in many other matters, in the district. During this time of war we have tried to- economise as much as possible without sacrificing efficiency. The staff of the hospital has been reduced by one staff nurse, but owing to the excellent administrative! qualiies of the Matron, Miss Streeter, and also to the fact of the low incidence of infectious disease, there has been no falling off in the good results of the hospital. My best thanks are due to her and her staff for another year's hard work. Thanking you for your kind consideration and support at all times, I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, R. LESLIE ROMER.
