I have the honour to present the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1962. Vital Statistics For the first time since 1953 the Registrar General's estimate of the population of Southward as at mid-year 1962 showed an increase, albeit a small one, rather than a decrease, as compared with the preceding year. In previous reports reference has been made to the annual decrease in the number of residents due to emigration from the borough which reached a peak some five or six years ago but of late had shown signs of diminishing. It is to be hoped that the fall in the population of this central London borough has now been arrested and that residential accommodation will continue to form a large proportion of future development. The number of live births was 1,651, which, after application of the comparability factor, gives a birth rate of 17.3 per 1,000 of the population. This is only slightly less than the figure for 1961 which was the highest birth rate experienced in Southwark since 1952, and is only 0.7 less than the rate for England and Wales. Another satisfactory feature of the statistics for 1962 is that lower figures were recorded for both the infant mortality rate and the still-birth rate, being 20.5 per 1,000 live births and 17.2 per 1,000 live and still births respectively. At 13.3 per 1,000 live births the neo-natal mortality rate showed a slight increase, but was still less than that for the country as a whole. Of the twenty two neo-natal deaths twenty occurred during the first week. One death during the year was attributed to pregnancy, childbirth or abortion. The crude general death rate was 14.2 per 1,000 of the population, which after adjustment for purposes of comparison falls to 11.9 per 1, 000, is very similar to the figures for the two preceding years and to the figure for England and Wales. There was little change in the individual causes of death as compared with 1961, diseases of the heart and circulation being the most important, followed by malignant diseases and diseases of the respiratory system. No less than 116 deaths were due to bronchitis and 63 to cancer of the lung. In contrast 8 people died of pulmonary Tuberculosis. -ii- Census 1961 Tables are included in this report which set out as far as possible a comparison between the statistics derived from the Census taken in 1961 and those from the census of 1951. Reference has already been made to the gradual diminution in the total population and it will be seen from the tables that whereas in 1951 the figure was 97,221 giving an average of 85.9 persons per acre,, in 1961 the total population was 86,249, an average of 76.3 persons per acre. In St. John's Ward this figure rose to 122.4 per acre. The number of private families fell from 32,052 to 29,281 while the number of structurally separate dwellings occupied increased from 23, 082 to 24, 540. The number of occupied rooms, however, decreased with the result that there was only a very slight decrease in the number of persons per room. The figures in table 5 show that there has been a change during the inter-censal years in the percentage of persons over 65 years of age, which is now 13.9 per cent as compared with 10.7 per cent in 1961. Persons of pensionable age in 1961 totalled 12,008 of which 8,542 were female. The details of the sanitary arrangements of private households set out in table 6 show the amount of ground which remains to be covered before each household has the exclusive use of a bath or water closet. In the year 1961 according to the Census Report, no fewer than 17,132 households out of a total of 28,900 or 59 per cent, had no bath. 203 households were entirely without a toilet and in 7,335 households the toilet was shared. Only some three thousand of Southwark residents were bom outside the British Isles. Of these approximately one third came from Commonwealth countries, one third from Asia, and one third from Europe, the largest single group being from Cyprus. Infectious Disease The experience of infectious disease in Southward during the year 1962 was satisfactory. Measles was not prevalent. There were no cases of diphtheria, nor typhoid. Dysentery was reported too frequently and although not reaching the level of 1960 there were rather more cases than in 1961. Although highly infectious dysentery is essentially preventable and as improved sanitary facilities are provided in houses, and in schools, more attention should be paid to the washing of hands after visiting the toilet and before meals. Only sixteen cases of whooping cough were notified, by far the lowest number in the last decade. Neither of the two children who developed poliomyelitis had been immunised against the condition. In one case there was some degree of residual paralysis of the lower limbs. Immunisation is now available against diphtheria, whooping cough tetanus, poliomyelitis, smallpox and tuberculosis. Although the vaccine against poliomyelitis can now be taken by mouth the list of injections required to maintain immunity against the various infectious diseases -iii- is quite formidable especially as reinforcing injections are often required. It is understandable, that mothers with several children find it difficult not to overlook any of the necessary injections especially booster doses . The London County Council as local health authority do a great deal to remind parents of what is required by each child at the appropriate time. In the interest of their children's health and well being parents should co-operate and should carefully retain the personal immunisation record card with which each child is provided. As this is written the only cases of diphtheria in the country are occurring in Southwark. A relatively small number of carriers have been disclosed by extensive investigation. Many of the infected children have either never been immunised or have been only incompletely immunised. The occurrence of this infection in Southwark in 1963 can be seen to be due to the lack of adequate imnunity by certain children; on the other hand, its localisation and confinement is due to the fact that a substantial proportion of children have been adequately immunised. Fortunately the disease has so far been mild but diphtheria must always be treated with respect. In a susceptible person it can be lethal. The lesson is clear. Parents must ensure that their children receive primary immunisation and booster doses as recommended, both in the interests of their own children and those of others. A diagnosis of Smallpox was excluded in several cases in which the condition was suspected, and a number of persons who immediately before arrival in this country had been in contact with smallpox were kept under surveillance for the appropriate period. Smallpox which occurred in North London at the end of 1961 appeared in a neighbouring south London borough in January 1962. In particular a child who had several days previously been resident in a large institution in Southwark was admitted to the smallpox isolation hospital as a suspect case. Fortunately adiagnosis of smallpox was eventually excluded, but meantime appropriate preventive measures were taken at the institution in question. The presence of these cases in the community created a public demand for vaccination which placed heavy demands on medical and nursing staff. Health Education Attention continued to be given throughout the year to this very important aspect of the work of a Public Health Department. The fundamental message which every effort was made to put over was the need for the general public to take advantage of the services which are provided. In particular in conjunction with the London County Council as local health authority, posters were displayed and leaflets were issued stressing the importance of parents ensuring that their children received the benefit of all the immunising procedures now available, including reinforcing doses where applicable. -iv- Apart from dysentery, to which reference has already been made, the occurence of cases of food poisoning and gastro-enteritis has resulted in a great deal of attention being given by the staff of this department to advice on personal and food hygiene and in widely publicising the simple measures which are required to prevent these conditions. Personal advice is given in the homes by the Public Health Inspector responsible for the investigations into cases of infectious disease who also distributed leaflets on the subject. The Public Health Inspectors also take an active part in this work, both in the homes, but in particular in the food shops in their districts. The Woman Public Health Inspector responsible for catering establishments is in a very good position to advise staff on the subject of food hygiene end the prevention of alimentary infections. In April the Public Health Committee considered the question of Smoking and Health in the light of the report on this subject published by the Royal College of Physicians and your Medical Officer of Health was authorised to collaborate with the London County Council in publicising in the borough the dangers to health of smoking, particularly of cigarettes. Posters have been displayed on the Council's notice boards and a large number of leaflets have been distributed. In the autumn the Council took an active part in the display of publicity material drawing attention to the danger of delay in obtaining treatment for venereal disease and this important question was also referred to in the Civic News. The Woman Health Officer took every opportunity when visiting old people in their homes of advising then; of the dangers of home accidents, as well as giving practical advice in regard to gas cookers and the use of fireguards and so on. Chest X-Ray Campaign A Chest X-Ray Campaign organised in collaboration with the South East London Mass X-Ray Service, was conducted in the borough from June 22nd until July 25th. Various areas were visited during this period and one unit was based, with the consent of the Chairman of the General Purposes Committee, at the Municipal Offices from June 22nd until July 6th. Further special visits were made to Newington Lodge and individual firms during the remainder of July and August. In all, 7671 persons were examined. The support of His Worship the Mayor and Members of the Council, who visited the Unit in the Health Services Department, was most valuable and very much appreciated. Facilities for publicity were kindly given by the Chairmen and Members of several of the Council's Commitees. The success of the campaign was considerably assisted by the willing co-operation of the Metropolitan Police and volunteers, including in -v- particular, Civil Defence personnel, Scouts, etc., who distributed leaflets to homes. A £10 cash prize was donated by the Chairman, and six one-guinea grocery vouchers or parcels given by Messrs. J. Sainsbury and P. Woolworth awarded to winning numbers did a great deal to encourage attendance at the Units. Quite apart from the figures of attendances and soon, in my opinion this survey was very well worth while by virtue of the fact that as a result of it a number of individuals were put under immediate treatment for previously unsuspected tuberculosis with beneficial results to themselves, their families, and all with whom they were in everyday contact. Some of these cases were in an advanced state and several needed hospital treatment. 3,704 of the persons X-Rayed during this special survey had not been x-rayed before and thirteen active cases of tuberculosis were discovered, among these seven men and six women, giving an incidence of 3.8 and 3.3 per thousand x-rayed respectively. Dr. J.M. Morgan, Director of the South East London Mass X-Ray Service writes to me as follows:- "I feel that the findings of three active cases in each thousand of the public x-rayed reflects much credit on the example set by your Council and all the work put in by the Chairman of the Health Committee, yourself and your officers, and many of the local residents who gave valuable help in publicising the presence of the units. It is obvious that if we could reach more of the general public who have never yet been x-rayed, we should discover that there are still many unknown cases of tuberculosis remaining untreated and infectious. May I convey my thanks to you for all your assistance in the campaign and I shall be grateful if you will kindly convey to the Council our appreciation for all their co-operation." Welfare of the Elderly Extracts from the twelfth annual report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee, prepared by the organising secretary Miss Doris M. Beer, A.I.S.W., M.R.I.P.H.H., are reproduced at the end of this report. They give a vivid picture of the very valuable work which is being undertaken at and from St. Alban's Hall. The total number of meals served in the restaurant, luncheon clubs, and in the oldpeople's own homes numbered no fewer than 107, 301 a record figure, and an indication of the benefit received by a large number of old people. The workshops for the elderly continued to be very active. Plenty of work is available and the scheme has brought improved health and happiness to those taking part. This is also true of the holidays which are arranged each year at Bognor. No one who visits the old people at the seaside can fail to be impressed by the great joy which these holidays give. -vi- The Committee is extremely fortunate in being able to provide a very excellent chiropody service. The facilities available at the London County Clinics are unfortunately restricted by a shortage of chiropodists. At the end of the year the Chairman of the Public Health Committee of the County Council was good enough to receive the Chairman and representatives of the Southwark Public Health Committee who drew attention to the need for additional' sessions at St. Alban's Hall for which additional monies have since been provided. The Committee occupy at a nominal rent premises in the ownership of the Southwark Borough Council. In addition the Council makes very substantial grants to the Committee. In my report last year I drew attention to the reasons which had led the Council to agree to the appointment of a Woman Health Officer on the staff of this department. This appointment proved to be very successful, and it soon became apparent that there was ample work for another officer to undertake the visitation of this special group of home bound old people. The report of the Superintendent of the Treatment and Bathing Centre Mr. T. Lloyd, T. D., indicates how the incontinent laundry service for old people forms a greater proportion of the work at King James Street. This service makes it possible for many elderly patients to be nursed in their own homes. The staff of the Treatment centre also provide the home bathing service for certain old people who although not requiring the service of the district Nurse, are still in need of this type of assistance. Compulsory removal to hospital was necessary in only one case during the year. The old gentleman concerned died eleven days after admission. This particular case only came to the notice of the Public Health Department at a very late stage. Well-meaning neighbours did not feel it was their responsibility to 'report' the position regarding this old gentleman who had gradually become more feeble nor to draw attention to the conditions under which he was living. The National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act 1962 extends the powers of local authorities previously held under section 31 of the 1948 Act. and enables them (a) to assist voluntary organisations to provide meals or recreation for old people, by making contributions to the cost of the service; providing, by gift or loan or otherwise, furniture, vehicles or equipment; permitting them to use premises belonging to the local authority; and making available the services of local authority staff connected with the premises or vehicles which the organisation is permitted to use; - vii- (b) to provide meals and recreation for old people, either directly or through the agency of voluntary organisations, and to recover such charges (if any) as the authority may determine, having regard to the cost of the service. Clean Air Mr. G. Stubbs, Smoke Abatement Officer, is a member of the Executive Council of the National Society for Clean Air, and the position in Southwark in 1962 can be seen from his report. Housing The measures taken in regard to slum clearance are set out in the body of this report. The Public Health Inspectors were also active in drawing attention to sanitary defects and a substantial amount of the remedial works involved were undertaken directly by the Council in default of the owners. The unremitting attention which is necessary in regard to the older properties in the borough to ensure that common staircases and yards are kept reasonably clean, and to ensure the maintenance of dust chutes, gullies, and overflow pipes, was mentioned last year. The Housing Act 1962 and the Houses in Multiple Occupation Regulations made thereunder strengthen the hand of the local authority in regard to the properties which come within the scope of the regulations. Unfortunately blocks of flats with separate toilets do not do so. The congratulations of the Council were extended to the Chief Public Health Inspector Mr. H. Archer, for the excellent paper which he presented to the Annual Conference of the Association of Public Health Inspectors at Southport in September. The paper which was received with a standing ovation excited a great deal of comment in the national press. Five blocks of flats being dealt with under the Regulations by virtue of the fact that toilets were shared by more than one family were seen by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during a visit to Southwark, and later in the year as a result of representations from the tenants' associations the Town Clerk wrote to each tenant inviting details of any complaints concerning the property. Only a few of the replies received mentioned matters which could be dealt with under the new Regulations. Several large blocks of tenements fall to be dealt with during the current slum clearance programme. Others, although substantially built, are lacking in essential amenities and by their bad arrangement lack sufficient light. Their replacement at lower density involved decanting on a large scale. Despite the progress which has been made the lack of housing accommodation at reasonable rents continues to be one of the most urgent -viii- problems facing the Authority. The health of many families in Southwark would undoubtedly benefit by improved, and in some cases larger housing accommodation. There are still too many old people and physically handicapped persons living on higher floors without lifts. Their circumstances present a particularly pathetic aspect of the housing shortage. Detailed consideration was given to cases referred for consideration for rehousing on health grounds as well as to families who were found to be overcrowded. Common Lodging Houses From information received from the National Assistance Board as well as from an article in the "Observer" dated 11th March 1962 the Ministry of Housing and Local Government were satisfied that there was a real problem regarding Common Lodging Houses in London. They enquired whether a new set of Model Bye-Laws would help local authorities to improve lodging house conditions. A detailed questionnaire on this subject was sent to each of the Medical Officers of Health of the City and those Metropolitan boroughs in whose area common lodging houses are situated. The large amount of information so obtained was collated in this department and passed to the Standing Joint Committee for transmission to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. The position in the six common lodging houses in Southwark is set out in this report. Within the framework of the existing bye-laws conditions are gradually being improved. They are still not up to present day standards although they are much better than those in the large common lodging house mentioned in the "Observer" article. The same article pointed out that the "House Full" notice may be the worst feature of a common lodging house, and stressed the importance of the social aspects of the welfare of the residents. Home Accidents I am indebted to Dr. J.A. Scott, O.B. E., Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, for information regarding the number of home accidents reported by the London Ambulance Service according to cause and age of patient, cause and Divisional area of residence, and the total number occurring in residents in this Borough. The relevant details are set out in a section of this report. In regard to the prevention of home accidents, acknowledgement is made of the assistance received from officials of the Gas and Electricity Boards in regard to the state of appliances and the siting of meters in use by old people. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Reports regarding the accommodation at St. George's Churchyard -ix which housed the mortuary and Coroners Court-serving, in addition to Southwark, the Metropolitan boroughs of Bermondsey, Lambeth and Camberwell, were submitted to the Public Health Committee and it was decided that the extension and modernisation of the premises should be undertaken. The agreement of the other three authorities concerned as well as of the London County Council, who use the Coroners' Court, was obtained and plans were drawn up by a Consultant Architect in conjunction with the Borough Engineer's Department. Several meetings were held between Her Majesty's Coroner, and certain of the pathologists, the Consultant Architect, the Chief Architectural Assistant and myself to discuss plans equipment. Building operations commenced on November 6th. Alternative arrangements had to made for the work of the mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Court was transferred to Westminster and the Mortuary work was divided between Battersea and Westminster. Shortly after the transfer a very high mortality was unfortunately experienced owing to climatic conditions. Although staff from Southwark went to Westminster and Battersea a very severe strain was placed on the mortuaries in these boroughs and sincere thanks are due to Dr. J.H. Briscoe Smith and Dr. J. Tudor Lewis and to their staffs for their co-operation in this matter. Staff During the year under review the shortage of Public Health Inspectors became acute in Southwark and special reports on this subject were submitted to the Public Health and Appointments Committees. Careful consideration was given to the duties of these officers and it was decided that although housing work was necessarily carried out by Public Health Inspectors a great deal of the routine work in relation to smoke control areas could be done by other officers under the supervision of a Public Health Inspector. Conclusion Sincere thanks are due to the Chairmen and members of the various committees for their consideration and encouragement, and for their interest in public health matters throughout the year. I wish to express my thanks also to the Chief Officers of the Council and to the staff of their departments for their co-operation and help at all times. It is a pleasure to work with Dr. W.H.S. Wallace, Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council, and the members of his staff, and one wishes to acknowledge the great deal of help which is received from Dr. Tomlinson of the Public Health Laboratory Service as well as from Dr. Betty Hobbs and many others. Finally I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. H. Archer, the Senior Clerk Mr. E. A. Clark, and to the entire staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal support and assistance throughout the year. -X- I have the honour to be Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, A.D.C.S.

The Borough forms a boundary with Lambeth to the west, as far south as Kennington Park, to the south with Camberwell, and to the east with Bermondsey. The landward part of the Borough extends to 1,131 acres and is divided into ten Wards. The Elephant and Castle forms a landmark, roughly dividing the borough into two. The portion of the borough between the Elephant and the river is becoming increasingly devoted to wharves, warehouses, diverse industry including food factories, and the printing trade, and offices, while the area south and southeast of the Elephant is mainly residential in character. The provision of office accommodation in the northern part of the Borough continues a trend of commercialisation which was commented upon sixty years ago by toe Borough's first Medical Officer of Health in his first annual report. The momentum of development has however of late ragidly increased, not only in the north but also in the southern part of the borough where the improved aesthetic effects of the new and attractive housing estates which have been built both by this Council and the London County Council, with their associated open spaces become ever more apparent. The role of Southwark as a religious centre is symbolised by the two fine Cathedrals which it contains. The historic and cultural aspects of the borough are well known and the commercial and industrial importance of this central London borough have continued to increase. The extensive redevelopment which is taking place at the Elephant and Castle, the Brandon Estate and elsewhere are already giving Southwark a new look. A large modern office block already houses the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Health now occupy newly constructed offices at the Elephant and Castle. -2- VITAL STATISTICS Land Area 1,131 acres Estimated Number of Dwellings 25,167 Dwellings Erected by Borough Council During Year 148 * Approximate Rateable Value (Total) £2,467,532 (Dwellings) £570,001 * Sum represented by a Penny Rate £9, 250 Population: Census 1961 86,249 Registrar General's estimate (mid-1962) 86,440 This estimate represents an increase in the figure for 1961 of 170 The natural increase in population - that is, the excess of births over deaths - was 418 compared with 444 for the previous year 1952 - 97,970 1957 - 91,140 1953 - 96,870 1958 - 89,920 1954 - 95,370 1959 - 88,720 1955 - 93,820 1960 - 88,690 1956 - 92,300 1961 - 86,270 Live - Births - 1651: Rate per 1,000 pop 19.1 Adjusted by comparability factor (0.91) 17.3 Still births - 29: Rate per 1,000 total births 17.2 Total births - Live and still 1,680 Total deaths - 1233: Rate per 1,000 pop 14.2 Adjusted by comparability factor (0.84) 11.9 Infant deaths - 34: Rate per 1,000 live births 20.5 Rate per 1,000 live births, legitimate 20.1 illegitimate 25.1 Neo-Natal mortality - 22 (under 4 weeks) Rate per 1,000 live births 13.3 Illegitimate Live Births - 159 Percentage of total live births 9.6 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) 1 Rate per 1,000 live and still births 0.5 Perinatal mortality - 20 (under 1 week) Rate per 1,000 total births 29.1 -3- COMPARATIVE ADJUSTED BIRTH AND DEATH RATES 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 live Births Southwark 14.7 15.2 14.9 15.4 16. 1 15.8 15.3 16.2 17.8 17.3 England and Wales (per 1,000 population) 15. 5 15. 2 15. 0 15. 6 16.1 16. 4 16. 5 17.1 17.4 18.0 Total Deaths Southwark 12.7 11.8 14.1 11.6 10.8 10.2 11.5 12.0 12.0 11.9 England and Wales (per 1,000 population) 11.4 11.3 11.7 11.7 11.5 11.7 11.6 11.5 12.0 11.9 Infant Deaths Southwark 32.3 20.6 28.1 16.0 22.3 26.7 28.2 26.8 21.8 20.5 England and Wales (per 1,000 Live Births) 26.8 25.4 24.9 23.7 23. 1 22.6 22.2 21.7 21.6 21.4 Still Births 23. 3 27. 5 22.1 18. 7 24.7 20. 1 18. 0 15. 9 20.8 17. 2 England and Wales (per 1,000 Total Births) 22.5 23.5 23.2 22.9 22.4 21.6 21.0 19.7 19.1 18.1 Neo-Natal Mortality (under 4 weeks) Southwark 20.35 12. 98 20.80 11.08 15.69 18.68 16.4 16.8 11.8 13.3 England and Wales (per 1,000 Live Births) 17.7 17.7 17.3 16.8 16.5 16.2 15.8 15.6 15.5 15.1 Maternal Mortality 0.5 1.1 1.1 Nil Nil 0.6 Nil 0.61 1.1 0.5 England and Wales (per 1.000 Live & Still Births') 0.75 0.7 0.64 0.56 0.47 0. 43 0.38 0.30 0.33 0.35 (England & Wales rates for 1961 are provisional estimates only) -4- YEAR LEGITIMATE ILLEGITIMATE TOTAL Male Female Total Male Female Total Male Female Total LIVE BIRTHS 1958 773 728 1,501 56 49 105 829 777 1,606 1959 735 678 1,413 62 48 110 797 726 1,523 1960 789 701 1,490 59 51 110 848 752 1,600 1961 791 744 1,535 78 79 157 869 823 1,692 1962 817 675 1,492 88 71 159 905 746 1,651 STILL BIRTHS 1958 16 13 29 3 1 4 19 14 33 1959 11 15 26 1 1 2 12 16 28 1960 8 16 24 1 1 2 9 17 26 1961 17 12 29 3 4 7 20 16 36 1962 10 15 25 3 1 4 13 16 29 INFANT DEATHS (Under 1 year) 1958 20 18 38 3 2 5 23 20 43 1959 20 19 39 3 1 4 23 20 43 1960 17 22 39 2 2 4 19 23 43 1961 17 13 30 3 4 7 20 17 37 1962 18 12 30 2 2 4 20 14 34 -5- DEATHS Male and Female Age Groups Under 1 1-4 5-14 15-44 45-64 65 and over Total Males 20 4 6 30 182 407 649 Females 14 4 2 21 89 454 584 34 8 8 51 271 861 1233 Infant Mortality The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 34, the causes of death being as follows:- Pneumonia 1 Gastritis, Enteritis & Diarrhoea 1 Congenital Malformations 7 * Other defined and ill defined diseases 24 Accidents, other than vehicle 1 34 Twenty of these deaths occurred under the age of one week, as follows: - Males Females Legitimate 14 5 Illegitimate - 1 Maternal Mortality One maternal death occurred in the 15-24 age group. -6- CANCER DEATHS Year Cancer of: Lung and Bronchus Other Organs Total Cancer deaths per 1,000 pop.

Lloyd, T. D. ) In the past decade the number of persons requiring treatment at the Council's Centre, for verminous conditions of the head and body, has shown a most decided decrease. The reduction in numbers is most marked in regard to children of school age. During the year 1952, a total of 2,559 school children were treated at this centre for verminous conditions of the head and body, whereas, in 1962, only 375 school children were found to require treatment and, in every case, for head lice only. None were found with body lice infestations. With regard to adult persons requiring treatment for personal verminous conditions during the same period; the decrease in numbers, although less substantial, is nevertheless quite considerable, andwas as follows:- 1952. Verminous treatments - Adults. Males 959. Females 500 1962. Verminous treatments - Adults. Males 459. Females 166 433 of the 459 adult male persons requiring treatment, (in every case for body-lice,) were sent from common lodging houses and hostels, or were vagrants. We have in this Borough a large number of Common Lodging House beds that attract casual lodgers from other areas of London and the South. Most of the credit for this very welcome decrease in the numbers of persons requiring treatment for personal vermin infestations, must undoubtedly be given to the great improvement in housing conditions in the Borough during these ten years. Overcrowding and the absence of suitable and sufficient domestic washing facilities, are two of the conditions most inducive to the dissemination of lice within the family, or other groups of people living in close proximity. The incontinent laundry service continues to build up and the installation of additional laundry macinery and modern boilers, has enabled us to cope with the incresed demand. Over 49,000 lbs weight of soiled bedding and clothing was collected from incontinent aged and sick persons during the year, laundered and returned on the day following collection. This service is of course, quite free to those known to have functional incontinence. The recommendations to receive the service come mainly from the Doctors and District Nurses attending those unfortunate enough to have this added-burden to advanced age and sickness. Precautionary disinfestation of furniture, bedding and soft goods was carried out during the year for 168 families rehoused by the Borough Council, in their new flats and houses. This treatment is carried out in every case when a family is re-housed. It has been gratifying to note that each year obvious infestations of families effects have been progressively fewer in number. -38- Infectious Disease Cases: Enquiries and Visits Total 462 as under: Gastro enteritis 2 Scarlet Fever 66 Poliomyelitis 2 Dysentery (bacilliary) 251 Smallpox contacts 42 Food Poisoning 17 Erysipelas 3 Meningococcal infections 2 Revisits 77 Disinfection following infectious diseases Rooms treated (Formalin solution) 46 Library books treated 107 Other disinfection, Tuberculosis etc. 4 Treatment of Verminous and Infected Articles (including precautionary disinfestation) Verminous articles treated Infected articles treated Beds 98 2 Palliasses 601 21 Bolsters 88 4 Pillows 928 72 Cushions 29 14 Blankets 1643 87 Sheets 864 53 Quilts 647 21 Other articles (clothing, etc.) 7686 409 Rehousing Precautionary disinfestation of soft goods and bedding 168 families. -39- Scabies and Vermin Treatments Scabies Vemin Males Females Males Females Lambeth cases 19 23 13 55 treatments 30 42 13 56 Southwark cases 15 21 446 110 treatments 29 37 446 110 L.C.C.

During the year, 4 complaints were received. The Metropolitan Water Board was informed and the samples analysed, and found satisfactory. Whilst the Board from time to time draws samples for bacteriological and chemical examination, samples of drinking water have been taken by the Public Health Inspectors and submitted to the Public Analyst who has reported in each case that the supply was satisfactory. In many of the old tenement buildings the water supply is communal, there being taps on the staircase landings whilst in others the water passes through storage tanks on the roofs. The indirect supply of water for drinking purposes has been considered in a number of cases to be unsatisfactory and representations have been made to the owners with a view to all taps being supplied direct from the rising main. -44- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 - Section 98 During the year 17 notifications of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board.

Five premises are registered for the use of filling materials and two licensed for manufacture or storage of Rag Flock. -50- AIR POLLUTION (Smoke Abatement Officer -Mr. G. Stubbs) The overall figures of air pollution recorded by the Council's instruments show that the improvement of the previous year had not been maintained. The 'smog' conditions which prevailed in the London area from 3rd to 7th December 1962 caused a great increase in atmospheric pollution. During this period the smoke was about five times the normal quantity and the sulphur dioxide more than six times the normal concentration. When the 'smog' cleared the measurements of pollution returned to the normal figures for the time of year. The Smoke Control Order No.2 made by the Council on 10th January 1962 was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 11th May to come into operation on 5th November 1962. The area is residential and is bounded by Farmer's Road, St. Agnes Place, Kennington Park Place, Cook's Road, Fleming Road, St. Paul's Church, Lorrimore Square, rear of Carter Street (south side), Penrose Street, rear of Lorrimore Road (south side), 204-262 (even) Olney Road, Heiron Street, and Hillingdon Street, and includes most of the London County Council Brandon Estate, and covers 40 acres. Included in the area are 1,324 separate dwellings, 14 shops and public houses, one nursery, three Churches, three factories and workplaces. The figures of the survey showed that the appliances in 141 dwellings needed replacement or adaptations with gas ignition, at an estimated total cost of £2,150. No adaptations of appliances in bedrooms were considered except in special circumstances. It was calculated that 275 additional tons of smokeless fuel would be required for the area. A meeting with coal merchants, representatives of nationalised undertakings, smokeless fuel manufacturers and other interested bodies, regarding the availability and prices of smokeless fuels took place at the Town Hall on 18th September 1962, presided over by Mr. Councillor W.A. Miller. Assurances were given at the meeting that there would be a sufficient supply of smokeless fuels available for the No. 2 Smoke Control Area. There was a discussion on the prices charged for pre-packed fuel - paper bags containing 14 lbs. and 28 lbs. of house coal or smokeless fuel. There has been a great increase in the demand for pre-packed fuels and complaints had been received of the high prices charged by some dealers. Following the confirmation of the Order, the occupiers and owners of dwellings which required some adaptation were advised fully of the position and the owners were also sent the estimate forms. The occupiers of dwellings which did not require any modification were informed by letter of the date and terms of the Order. -51– It was found that the estimates submitted by the owners were usually reasonable and in instances where the specifications and estimates were considered excessive, there were discussions and agreement with the owners. Nearly all the required work was completed by 5th November, the outstanding items being mainly gas ignition work. Householders in the Area expressed approval of the scheme and satisfaction with the work carried out. Co-operation in providing information and assistance to the residents was readily given by the London Electricity Board, South Eastern Gas Board, Coal Utilisation Council and Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation. The mobile exhibition of the Solid Smokeless fuels Federation toured the areas demonstrating the correct way to burn smokeless fuels efficiently and special attention was given to the burning of Sebrite. A Display stand with appropriate literature explaining the purpose of Smoke Control Areas was on show in the entrance to the Municipal Offices. As a result of certain trolleymen offering coal to residents in No. 1 Smoke Control Area, representations were made to two firms who employed the men and they readily agreed to co-operate to stop the practice and issued the appropriate instructions to their trolleymen. Complaints of difficulty in obtaining supplies of premium fuels were received at the beginning of the year with the coming of the severe weather. Investigations were made at the Coal Depots where the merchants confirmed that there was a temporary shortage and explained their difficulties in meeting peak demands. Fortunately the shortage was not of long duration and soon the delivery time to householders was considerably reduced. Eleven notifications were received of proposals to install new furnaces, and plans and specifications submitted for approval in respect of one other installation are the subject of negotiations. The Council has in use a daily volumetric smoke and sulphur dioxide apparatus, two standard deposit gauges, and three lead peroxide instruments. The Central Electricity Generating Board has a lead peroxide instrument on the jetty of the Bankside Power station. During the year 12 complaints were received of smoke and grit emission; 193 special observations and inspections were made, and 10 Intimation Notices were issued. It is pleasing to record that the managements took remedial action on all occasions. -52- Deposited matter at following sites:- 1962 Rainfall (inches) BANKSIDE WALWORTH ROAD Mean Daily Concentration of Sulphur Dioxide micro gms. per cubic metre.

There are three pools with sizes and capacities as follows. Total attendances for the year ending March 31st 1963 were 204, 982. (a) lst-Class Swim Length 120 ft. Width 40ft. Capacity 157,000 gallons. (b) 2nd-Class Swim Length 144 ft. Width 35 ft. Capacity 164,898 gallons. (c) Small Swim Length 60 ft. Width 25 ft. Capacity 49,000 gallons. Method of Treatment Filtration through sand filters installed by Paterson Engineering Co. in 1935. Breakpoint Chlorination with Chlorine Gas Plants. Frequency of Change 3½ hour turnover on each pool. Source of Supply Metropolitan Water Board. Eighteen bath samples were analysed by the Public Analyst. It is standard practice to record the number of bathers who have used the bath prior to the sample being taken and the number of bathers in the pool at the time of sampling, and the appearance of the water. In only three cases was the appearance cloudy, and in one of these 100 bathers were using the bath at the time of sampling. In no case, however, was the bacterial count more than 5 per million, and in 12 samples (including that taken with 100 bathers) there were no growths of bacteria. Free chlorine ranged from 0.5 to 3.1 parts per million. Bacteriological Examination (a) Bacillus coli - Not found in 50 mls. - 18 (b) Number of bacteria per ml.

SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL The arrangements in the borough are under the administration of the Borough Council and the London County Council, the latter authority being responsible for sewage disposal. TRADE EFFLUENTS The London County Council General Powers Act of 1962 gave further powers regarding trade effluents discharged into sewers, and the prevention of flooding. There has been no recent flooding of basement premises, and the question of the discharge of trade effluents was still under consideration at the end of the year. The powers and duties of the Council under Parts II and III of the Act have been included in the terms of reference of the Public Health Committee. REFUSE STORAGE AND DISPOSAL There are now twenty eight properties where ashpits are still in use, a number of which are below ground level. There has been a concentrated drive to get rid of this type of refuse storage, and considerable improvement has been made. Consideration has been given to a suggestion for the installation of paper bag dustbin receptacles, but as the disadvantages outweighed the advantages, the Council decided not to support this proposal. -55- LICENSING ACT 1961 REGISTRATION OF CLUB PREMISES Part III and the 5th to 8th Schedules of this Act, replace the provision of Part IX of the Licensing Act, 1953, (under which registration of clubs for the supply of intoxicating liquor was virtually automatic) by provisions under which a club in which intoxicating liquor is to be sold or supplied to members or their guests must apply to a Magistrates' Court for a Certificate of Registration which, in most cases, will require renewal annually. Objections to the granting or renewal of a certificate may be lodged by the Police, the local authority, the Fire Brigade or by any person affected by reason of his occupation or of interest in other premises. The Act provides that, on behalf of the Council, an officer authorised in writing, may inspect premises for which application is made. These inspections should be made within 14 days of the making of the application and are subject to 48 hours notice to the applicant or occupier of the premises. As a general rule objections by the Council to the granting of certificates of registration must be made within one month of the date of application. The Chief Public Health Inspector, having been appointed authorised officer under this Act, inspected all club premises in respect of which applications were made for certificates of registration. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT 1960 Complaints have been investigated in regard to noise from the loading and unloading of lorries, engineering work and building work, all at night time, and the operation of machinery in day time. Considerable improvements have been effected and at the end of the year, two or three cases were still being dealt with. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES The Council's bye laws as to artificial lighting of common staircases have, in the main, been properly observed. In those cases where there have been contraventions the necessary work has been carried out without resorting to legal proceedings. -56- PUBLIC CONVENIENCES The day to day administration of the Council's public conveniences is under the control of the Borough Engineer. These conveniences have been well maintained, but serious consideration has been given to the resiting of some of the existing conveniences and the finding of suitable sites for new ones. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 1961 This act empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations imposing requirements as to the composition, contents, design, construction, finish or packing of such goods as he may prescribe and as to the warnings or instructions to be sent with such goods. The sale, or possession for sale, of goods not complying with any regulations made under the Act is prohibited. There are certain saving provisions. Powers of inspection and testing are given to local authorities and their authorised officers, who may institute proceedings for offences under the Act committed in their area. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES BILL The main provisions of this Bill have been under consideration in preparation for the implementation of the new requirements when they become law. LANDLORD AND TENANT ACT 1962 The main provisions of this Act are as follows. Obligation to Provide Rent Book Every landlord who lets a house, flat, rooms or a single room on a weekly tenancy for residential occupation must provide a rent book - it does not matter whether the accommodation is controlled or decontrolled, or whether it is furnished or unfurnished.

HOUSING ACT 1961 - PART II HOUSES IN MULTIPLE OCCUPATION The principal problems which could be dealt with under this new legislation in Southwark are in relation to tenement buildings built as model dwellings some ninety years ago. These buildings were brought into the scope of legislation by reason of section 22 of the Act. A survey has been carried out showing that apart from the tenement buildings there are some 5000 houses in multiple occupation and approximately 100 of these call for action by the authority. Five blocks of tenements were the subject of notices of intention to make Management Orders and subsequently the conditions were improved and the Council did not make the Orders. A detailed survey of houses calling for action was being carried out, and as a result of informal action conditions at a number of the tenement buildings were improved. Had Section 22 been wider in its powers as to the control of tenement buildings, more could have been done. At the Annual Conference of the Association of Public Health Inspectors, Mr. Harold Archer, the Chief Public Health Inspector, gave an address on the subject of Houses in Multiple Occupation. The Council's congratulations were extended to Mr. Archer on the excellent manner in which he had presented his address, copies of which had been sent to each Member. In this paper, the extent of the problem was reviewed and Mr. Archer discussed the powers and responsibilities of local authorities, with special regard as to management, amenities and overcrowding. He stressed that immediate attention should be given to en suring proper management, and, at the same time or subsequently, as circumstances permitted, that a strenous drive should be made to provide adequate facilities and services and to control occupation. -64FOOD THE INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year, 144,926 tons of imported food were inspected under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 1937 and 1948, and the Preservatives in Pood Regulations 1962.

Beer, A.I.S.W., Organising Secretary of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee:- "We present the Twelfth Annual Report of the Southwark Old People's Welfare Committee for the year 1962/63 and in so doing we are pleased to announce once again that progress has been made in every section of the work. More meals have been served in the Restaurant and more meals have been delivered by our meals - on -wheels service. More old people were taken on holiday. Numbers have increased in the Workshops and many more old people have come to St. Alban's Hall seeking help and finding friendship. We have received generous help from the Borough Council both financially and practically and we would like to thank the Mayor, Councillor P.W. Fuller, J.P. for his unfailing interest in our progress. Once again we have pleasure in thanking our M.P. and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Gunter, for their very active support throughout the year. The subject of old age has been given much publicity during the last few months and greater measures of help have been promised to this section of the community. The need for consideration and planning for the aged is obvious, the age of the population is increasing and the population structure is becoming unbalanced. Therefore, to give consideration to the study of the needs and problems facing this age group is of the utmost importance. The Old People's Welfare is sure that the only way to keep this age group from becoming too much of a social and financial burden to the country is to bring to the old people new interests and activities; to prove to those who have just retired that life is not over, but that with the closing of their working days comes the opportunity of starting something new. The aim of the Committee is to keep old age at bay by offering new interests to those who find themselves without the ability to help themselves. "There is nothing so insupportable to man as to be in entire repose, without passion, occupation, amusement or application. Then it is that he feels his own nothingness, isolation, insignificance, dependent nature, powerlessness, emptiness. Immediately there issue from his soul ennui, sadness, chagrin, vexation, despair". Much of the constructive and preventive work of the Committee is not seen when you enter St. Alban's Hall but in the background it is going on all the time. During this year many old people were referred to us and each one of these presented a problem of some sort. Many were of a temporary nature and after a little help and -79- understanding the old people settled down again with just an occasional friendly visit to ensure that everything was all right. But in many other cases a lot of time and hard work is needed to straighten out a difficult situation. A list of a number of these applications taken at random gives some idea of the nature of the requests for help received over the past twelve months. Meals-on-Wheels Convalescence Holidays Surgical Equipment Tracing Missing Relatives Reuniting Families Transport Escorts Legal Matters Help with Removals Radio Moving dangerous meters Clothing and Bedding Hospital Visiting Illness Accidents Chiropody Religion and Consolation Letter Writing Occupational Therapy Chimney Sweeping Housing and Homes Cleaning Fuel Furniture Employment Social Interests Domestic Quarrels Care of Pets Friendly Visits General Care Mobile Library Service Applications come from varied sources and all day long the telephone at St. Alban's Hall is ringing doctors, hospital almoners, police, relatives, neighbours, employers, landlords, caretakers, clergy and religious organisations, L.C.C. departments, Borough Council, Government departments etc., all asking for help for some old person or couple in need or trouble. And it can be said once again this year "not one application for help has been refused". One afternoon during the very cold spell, a request came from a neighbour of an old man who had just heard that his wife, in hospital, was sinking. He was too infirm to make his own way to the hospital; could we take him? Already the car was out on an errand of mercy, and there were four more such journeys waiting to be done. However the neighbour was told "Yes, we would take him but it might not be till late evening Eventually the car arrived at the old man's door at 9.45 p.m. and he was allowed to sit with his wife for an hour. When the driver of the car arrived at the porter's gate of the hospital she was met with the remark "What!" You here again, don't you ever go home". While there is an urgent human need the Old People's Welfare is always on duty. -80- The exceptionally hard winter has taxed the resources of the Committee to the utmost. It led to the discovery of many old people without heating of any description. Many who relied entirely on the trolley-man each week for their supply of coal did not get any for weeks. During this bad spell it was not unusual to find our small meals-on-wheels van side by side with large coal carts and lorries at the railway sidings waiting for coal to arrive. We were given V.I.P. treatment and always served first. The coal was tipped into the van and the staff and helpers went round to the homes of the old people in need and shovelled the coal into scuttles, boxes and any available utensil. Then back to St. Alban's Hall where the van had to be cleaned out for the delivery of meals. On one occasion we travelled as far as Bromley for a five cwt. load. Added to the problem of coal was the problem of water. Everyone had frozen pipes and the only cup of tea enjoyed was had at St. Alban's Hall. To make their plight worse many could not reach the centre because of the conditions of the road, so many more had to have their dinners at home. The Meals-on-Wheels van had to cope with many more deliveries, as well as bad road conditions, and the vans usually back at 1.30 p.m. were still delivering at 4 p.m. A telephone call to the secretary one day was from an infuriated man who demanded that she should call in her van. "I have helped to dig it out three times and I am not going to do it again", he said. Visiting An average of 40 visits are made each week but most of these are to old people who have met with some calamity or are in need of some special service which we can render. There are many old people who are just lonely and although we try to visit as many of these as possible, we can only visit every two or three weeks. We need many more volunteers for this service. It has been said "Half the world stands willing to help and not knowing how" If you are one of those drop into St. Alban's Hall and we will help you to direct those odd moments of spare time, those little bits of kindness, those small pieces of generosity which you are ready to give. The Chiropody Clinic The demand for chiropody is still increasing and our hardpressed chiropodists are fighting a losing battle with the demands made upon them. This is a satisfying service because after treatment in their homes we have the joy of seeing many of the hitherto homebound, walking to the centre. We have recently acquired a pedaloperated chiropody chair which makes life much easier for the chiropodist and much better for the patient. -81- Meals on Wheels Service For the Meals-on-Wheels service the Borough is divided into six areas and each day six teams leave St. Alban's Hall to take hot meals to those who otherwise would never have a hot meal. The value of this work cannot be measured by numbers. The helpers observe as they serve. They must not let themselves be long delayed, for each one has about 40 dinners to deliver. But they will get a message to a coal merchant. They will even go back in the afternoon when they should be off duty with a sack of coal in the back of a car and carry it upstairs themselves. They will post a letter, phone a doctor. Sometimes they are the first to come upon a final, lonely passing. All this which is so precious in this service, can create a problem because the right kind of workers are hard to find. We are fortunate in Southwark and acknowledge with thanks all the extra services given to the old people by our Meals-on-Wheels teams. We also acknowledge with grateful thanks, the help of the W. V. S. in this service. Every day a W. V.S. van and team arrive to help with the distribution of these meals. St. Alban's Restaurant The Restaurant still plays a very big part in the lives of many of the old age pensioners living in Southwark. Many out doing their shopping will call in for a coffee and a chat with a friend. We feel that if it is only used by some for morning coffee they are getting to know us and will come to us when in difficulty. In fact, we have found this so in many cases. Our numbers are again increasing after a temporary decrease during the very severe winter weather. We give below a table showing the figures for the past three years: Restaurant Meals-on-Wheels Luncheon Clubs Total 1960/61 41,976 37,119 9,413 88,508 1961/62 46,800 48,549 6,875 102,224 1962/63 44,336 56,393 6,572 107,301 Workshops for the Elderly The scheme came into operation two years ago and has been slowly but surely building up. At the beginning there were morning sessions only, with eight to ten people working for two hours. As soon as more work was available, afternoon sessions were started, also for two hours and there are now twenty people working in the morning and twenty in the afternoon. The work undertaken has varied from making boxes, labelling bottles for chemicals, to stitching Christmas decorations and filling envelopes' for a mail order firm. At times it is not easy to obtain offers -82- of work, and our Workshops have had to face these periods of slackness. The aim of the organisation is rehabilitation - to help those who think they are long past work to realise that they are not old because they are pensioners. The scheme has already justified its existence by the therapeutic value and its effect on old people who are discouraged by inactivity. There have been several cases of workers going back into full and part-time employment and other who thought life was over for them are now leading happy and useful lives. Television for the Homebound A new venture this year has been the introduction of a scheme for bringing television into the homes of the homebound who have no means of providing this entertainment for themselves. With the co-operation of the British Relay Wireless Company, who have agreed to install sets free and charge only a nominal fee per week for maintenance, we are able to provide this service, including the licence, for £10 10s. 0d. a year. The Committee cannot afford to take on this added financial responsibility and we are asking for people to come forward to guarantee the ten guineas each a year. Already a number of sponsors have come forward; in some cases groups of friends have agreed among themselves to sponsor a set. As few as four friends paying 1/- a week each can bring continued joy to an oli person all through the year. We ask for many more sponsors to come forward to help in this very valuable work. Money Raising Events A flag day was held on Friday 7th September, when the total sum raised on the street collection was £95 18s. 5d. Another succesful Dickens Fair was held on 24th November and raised the total sum of £385 19s. 1d. This has become an annual event. Donations are always gratefully received and all money sent in this way goes to helping the old people. During the past very severe winter a considerable amount of coal was bought, as well as a number of gas and electric fires, and given to old people without any adequate heating facilities. Holiday Homes It is with very great pleasure that we can report immense progress made by the Holidays Homes Committee. Many successful money - raising functions have been held during the past year and the culmination of their efforts was when a cheque for £15,000 was received from Mr. J. -83- Collier. This magnificent gesture has made the Home possible and all old people living in Southwark who hitherto have been barred by infirmity from participating in the various schemes already established, will now be able to have a holiday by the sea. Holidays Holidays have again played a big part in the lives of many old age pensioners; we would like to pay tribute to the Mayor of Southwark who gave £500 from his fund to enable us to send so many away to Bognor, Southsea, Eastbourne and Clacton for a fortnight by the sea. The "Cheap Holidays for old age pensioners" given by the Southwark Borough Council and organised by the Old People's Welfare Committee, have given an opportunity for many old people who have never had a holiday to spend two weeks at the seaside. Christmas Activities The Christmas Dinner was, as usual, a great succes, and grateful thanks are due to the Southwark and Kennington Branches of Rotary for their generous contributions to the Christmas comforts. Hundreds of Christmas parcels were delivered from the United Africa Company and St. Christopher House to the old people and Kennington Toc H also made gifts. General Activities The usual weekly classes have taken place - dressmaking, handcrafts and leather Work. There have been drama and singing classes. Old Time Dancing still takes place on Wednesday evenings and is a firm favourite, and on that evening there is often an entertainment which is much appreciated by the old people. The St. Alban's Choir has achieved great success by taking first place at the recent SouthEast London Music Festival. The Over 60 Fellowship meets every Thursday afternoon under the leadership of a London City Missioner. The Mobile Library still functions every Friday under the helpful guidance of Councillor Mrs. Soltesz, and the homebound are also provided with reading matter." -84- HOME ACCIDENTS Information regarding home accidents is available from the London County Council giving figures reported by the London Ambulance Service according to cause and age, cause and Divisional area, and the total numbers in each borough. In regard to cause and age, estimates have been prepared of those occurring in Southwark during 1962 which are set out in Table 1 under the various causes. Similarly in Table 2, estimates have been made of the numbers of accidents occurring in Southwark in 1962 in the various age groups and the percentage contribution made by each age group to the total accidents. It is emphasised that these figures can only be estimates.

Certainly they receive less publicity. The position is, however, that more people die each year from home accidents than do as the result of injuries sustained on the road. In these circumstances it is reasonable that at least as much attention should be given to the prevention of home accidents as is at present given to road accidents. The prevention of the latter is the responsibility of the individual be he pedestrian or driver. This personal responsibility of the public is very much reinforced by statutory measures such as police control, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings, "no parking" signs and so on. The possibility of legal compulsion is very much diminished in relation to occurrences in private residences. Parliament has passed a certain amount of legislation mainly directed to making safe appliances and materials before they are taken into the home. For example, electric and gas fires cannot be sold without suitable guards, and oil stoves must conform to certain safety standards. Legal enforcement has been attempted in regard to the provision of fireguards, but any person over 16 years of age only becomes criminally liable if a child under the age of 12 years is killed, or sustains serious injury, as the result of burns or scalds whilst in their care, in any room containing an open fire grate or any heating appliance which is not sufficiently guarded. In the home, therefore, the prevention of accidents becomes much more a matter of personal responsibility than is the case in regard to accidents occurring elsewhere. Since the majority of home accidents occur in children under the age of five years and in men and women over the age of 65 years, as well as in the handicapped and infirm, this responsibility for prevention must, in many instances, be exercised, in the interest of others, by everyone who is fit and able to do so. -86- The commonest kinds of fatal accidents in the home are falls, burns and scalds, suffocation, and coal gas poisoning. Most of the falls and over half the burns and scalds are sustained by persons over 65 years of age. Suffocation and one in five of the burns and scalds happen to children under five. Apart from fatalities, however, a great deal of illness, both physical and mental, much of it preventable, results from burns and scalds in childhood and from falls in old age. How can this be avoided? Reference has been made to the personal element in the prevention of home accidents, but it must be recognised there is also the question of our own man-made environment. Gas, electricity, television and wireless sets all bring their own hazards into the home, but just as important is the basic design of the house itself. The mother of young children living in overcrowded or cramped conditions, where the kitchen is also the living room, will find it particularly difficult to safeguard her children especially when she is preparing meals or doing any washing. The old person will be much more liable to fall in older properties where he or she has to negotiate stairs and perhaps cross an uneven yard to reach the toilet. The improvement of housing conditions is therefore a fundamental prerequisite for home safety. The incidence of home accidents is reduced in homes which are well lighted, have modern and safe appliances,even floors and have suitable guards and handrails to protect children and the aged and infirm. Such homes are, unfortunately, not as yet universally available and meantime the prevention of home accidents, which calls for great care in modern properties, is a formidable task in older houses. It is, however, a task well worth undertaking and suitable measures will, even in adverse circumstances, prevent a large number of home accidents. The prevention of falls entails making sure that no objects such as dustpan and brush are left on ill-lighted staircases; that there is not a loop of flex running across the living room, nor a loose mat on a slippery floor. In the prevention of burns and scalds, both for old people and children, an efficient fireguard securely fixed is essential. Particular attention must be paid to movable sources of heat and light such as gas rings and oil lamps both as regards their stability and where they are placed in the room. The design of clothing is as important as the material from which it is made in the causation of burns, the loose frilly garment being particularly dangerous. Particular care must be taken with teapots and kettles containing hot fluids to ensure that their contents cannot be pulled down or fall on an unsuspecting child. Coas gas poisoning is a less common but tragic accident when it happens. Gas cookers used by old people are often old and inefficient. These can be checked by the Gas Board and if necessary a safety type of appliance can be installed. Another form of poisoning, this time mainly in children, can be avoided by ensuring that all medicines, particularly tablets and pills which resemble sweets, as well as disinfectant, are carefully locked away -87- beyond the reach of children. These are only some of the measures which can be adopted in order to make our homes safe. An important step to this end will have been taken when all of us become conscious of this problem and take upon ourselves the duty of doing everything possible, not only to ensure our own safety, but the safety of the young and the old.
