The tender of Mr. Palmer was accepted, and the works have been carried out. Possession has been obtained of the whole of the premises In the rear belonging to 28 and 30, Three Colt Street. Arrangements have been made with the Freeholder as to the premises in Church Lane, at the corner of Northey Street, for the Board to take a Conveyance of so much of the ground as is required for the Improvement. Mr. Parsons previously to pull down and rebuild the house to the new line of frontage, and to enclose the ground with a brick wall at his own expense.

Widening Wapping Wall.—Having been informed by Messrs. Anderson & Ludlam, of the Metropolitan Wharf, that they were about to pull down Nos. 12 to 23, Wapping Wall, and an opportunity being thus offered of widening the thoroughfare at that point, I prepared a plan shewing the proposed widening, and laid the same before the Board. The Board determined to carry out the improvement at the estimated cost of £5,633, provided the Metropolitan Board would contribute one half the same, and a memorial was presented to the Metropolitan Board requesting them to sanction the improvement, and to contribute thereto. That Board have given their sanction, and have consented to pay one half of the cost. Negociations are pending with the owners of the premises required for the improvement for the purchase of their interests in the same. Widening White Horse Street, near Dean Colet House. —A letter having been addressed to the Board, by Messrs. Newman & Billing, on behalf of the committee for building a new Parsonage on the site of Dean Colet House, offering to the Board the portion of land for widening White Horse Street, upon certain terms, it was resolved to carry out the proposed improvement, on condition that the Metropolitan Board would contribute one half the cost thereof, which that Board has consented to do. I have arranged with the owners of the premises to set back the line of frontage as agreed and the necessary steps will be taken to have the land conveyed to the Board. Proposed Improvements in High Street, Shadwell; Cable Street, and Victoria Street.—A letter having been received from Mr. Hunt, the engineer of the East London Railway Company, stating that as the works of the Company in the vicinity of High Street, Cable Street, and Victoria Street, were approaching completion, it seemed a favorable opportunity to consider the question of improvements in the thoroughfares, should the Board deem it advisable to do so; the matter was referred to me to enquire into the practicability of making any improvements in the locality. A plan prepared by Mr. Hunt, shewing the suggested improvements was laid before the Board, and I made a report thereon, and explained that the improvement suggested could not be carried out according to such plan on account of the expense that would be incurred. Proposed Widening of Commercial Road, opposite Limehouse Church.—The Metropolitan Board having adjourned the consideration of this matter until July, 1873, a letter was addressed to them by this Board requesting that if the improvement was to be considered, then this Board should be allowed an opportunity of expressing their views upon the subject. Subsequently to this the Metropolitan Board determined that the further consideration of all questions of Metropolitan improvements should stand over until July, 1874. IRON BRIDGE, BARKING ROAD. This Board, having been solicited by the West Ham Committee to unite with them and other Boards and Vestries in memorializing the Justices to consent to the erection of a new Iron Bridge over the River Lea, in Barking Road, the Board consented to affix their Seal to a Memorial prepared by the Secretary to the Committee, to the Justices in reference to the matter. A letter was also addressed to the Board upon the subject by Mr. Wilson, Clerk to the West Ham Local Board, requesting the Board to appoint a Deputation to co-operate with other local bodies on the Middlesex side of the River, to endeavour to influence the Middlesex Magistrates in favor of the proposed Bridge. A Deputation has been appointed by the Board for the purpose. COMMERCIAL ROAD. An order has been received from the Metropolitan Board, with Plan attached, specifying the portions of the Road which, as regards drainage and paving, are to be under the management of the Vestry of Mile End Old Town and this Board respectively. I have arranged a new line of Boundary with the Surveyor of the Poplar District, as to the future repairing and maintaining of that part of the West India Dock Road between Limehouse and Poplar, and that part of the East India Dock Road between the same parishes; and application has been made to the Metropolitan Board for an order of apportionment. LABORATORY. Pursuant to the instructions of the Board, I prepared a plan for the erection of a Laboratory in the yard of the Office of the Board, for the use of the Analyst, and laid the same before the Board. Tenders were received for the building thereof, and the tender of Mr. Stuttle was accepted. The building has "been erected and completed, and is in use by Dr. Rogers for analytical purposes. HIGH TIDES. On the 20th March, 1874, Wapping and Limehouse were inundated by a very high tide, and much damage was done thereby. Pursuant to the directions of the Board, the attention of the Metropolitan Board was called to the matter, and they were urged to give the question their serious consideration, with a view to obtaining Parliamentary powers for dealing with the same, and the resolution of the Board in reference to the matter was communicated to the other Districts concerned. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. London & Black wall Railway Bill.—Pursuant to the directions of the Board I agreed with the engineer of the Company for the insertion in the Bill of Clauses for the protection of the interests of the district. The Company subsequently withdrew from the Bill, Clause 4, sub. sec. 2, consequently the loop line from Rhodeswell Road to Island Row, Limehouse, was abandoned. Notice has since been given, and plans deposited by the Company to extend and improve the following stations and works: Fenchurch Street Station, Leman Street Station, Shadwell Station, Platforms of Stepney Station, Limehouse Station, West India Dock Station, Mill wall Junction Station, Formation of a new Station at Bow.
