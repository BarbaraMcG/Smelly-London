To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to present an Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1949, which has been compiled in accordance with Circular No. 2/50 of the Ministry of Health. It is satisfactory to note that the improvement in the general health, as shown by the Vital Statistics, has been continued during the year. The comparative table later in the Report shows that Penge can show as good or better figures as comparable parts of the country. The live-birth rate continues high although the expected drop from the peak years following the war continues. Infantile mortality has now reached a further low level record in the past year, and the general death rate is the lowest recorded since 1933. Again there was a high proportion of persons over 75 years of age among those who died. This large number of old people in the community presents many problems in their care and welfare, especially in the case of those who have become infirm and unable entirely to look after themselves. In many cases voluntary organisations are augmenting the help given by official departments. A meals service and home for old people are being very successfully run by voluntary bodies in this district. In spite of all this many cases of hardship are met with by my department which are very difficult to relieve. The figures for diphtheria immunisation again show satisfactory progress and about 70% of the young people under 15 years of age have received the necessary protective doses. The value of this method of protection is shown by the fact that for the second year in succession no case of diphtheria occurred in Penge. Clean food campaigns have been much in the public mind during the past few years and it is gratifying to report again that no case of food poisoning has been notified during the past year. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 770 Population (Census, 1931) 27,771 Civilian Population mid year 1949 (estimated by Registrar General) 24,850 Total Population „ „ „ „ „ „ „ 24,870 Rateable Value, 1st October, 1949 £193,787 Sum represented by 1d. rate £783 4 The district is situated on the slope of a hill, its highest point being 370 ft. above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 32, this being the highest in the County of Kent. The remains of the Crystal Palace and the greater part of the grounds, occupying approximately 127 acres, are within the district and provide a much needed " lung." The district is mainly residential although in recent years there has been an increase in the amount of industrial work in the district, the chief industries being engineering, button making, printing and laundry work. The Manager of the Employment Exchange informed me that there were approximately 85 persons registered as unemployed in the Penge Urban District at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS. Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population 20.84 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population 0.48 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 22.64 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population 11.22 Adjusted Death Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population 10.32 Deaths from Puerperal Causes:—Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 1.88 Death Rate of Infants Under One Year of Age. All infants per 1,000 live births 19.30 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 21.00 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births Nil Births. The live births registered during the year numbered 518. This gives a live birth rate of 20.84 per 1,000 Civilian Population compared with 22.74 for 1948. Stillbirths. The number of stillbirths registered was 12, equal to a rate of 22.64 per 1,000 total births, compared with 21.35 for 1948. Deaths. The deaths registered totalled 279, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.22 per 1,000 civilian population, compared with 11.69 for 1948. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.92. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 10.32, the lowest rate recorded for the district since 1933. 5 Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 14. It should be noted that a large proportion of the deaths were of elderly people, and of the total deaths 192 or 68.8% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 64.3% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 42.6% of the total deaths, compared with 30.-7% in 1948. Cancer. The Cancer death rate per 1,000 civilian population was 2.01, compared with 2.10 in 1948. Tuberculosis. The death rate per 1,000 civilian population was 0.40, as against 0.44 in 1948. Maternal Mortality. There was ore maternal death during the year, equal to a death rate of 1.88 per 1,000 total (live and still) births. This death was due to septicaemia following incomplete abortion. An open verdict was returned at the inquest. The maternal mortality rate for England and Wales was 0.98. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year of age was 10, corresponding to a rate of 19.30 per 1,000 births (which is the lowest rate recorded in Penge) compared with a rate of 30.25 for 1948. Comparative Vital Statistics. The following table shows the comparative figures for 1949:- Rate per 1,000 Civilian Population Death Rate per 1,000 Civilian Population Deaths under year per 1,000 live Births Live Births Still Births Penge Urban District 20.84 0.48 10.3 19.3 England and Wales *16.7 *0.39 *11.7 32 126 County Boroughs and Great Towns including London 18.7 0.47 12.5 37 148 Smaller Towns (resident populations, 25,000 to 50,000 at Census, 1931) 18.0 0.40 11.6 30 London Administrative County 18.5 0.37 12.2 29 *Rates per 1,000 total population. 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water Supply. All the houses in the district are provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water being examined bacteriolcgically daily by the Board. In addition, the County Pathologist reports that the samples of water submitted to him quarterly were good, Bacillus coli being absent in 100 c.c's. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Seven storage cisterns were renewed, cleansed or covered. Drainage and Sewerage. All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewerage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams. There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham, the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation. The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing. The house refuse was collected throughout the district by a contractor once every week and removed by him in closed vehicles. There are no cesspools within the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. This subject is dealt with in the Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. 7 HOUSING. During the year, the Local Authority converted 3 houses into 8 flats. Private builders erected 5 dwelling houses, 2 maisonettes and converted 11 houses into 26 flats. At the end of the year satisfactory progress had been made by the Council's Contractors in the erection of 132 flats in Queen Adelaide Road, several being ready for occupation early in 1950. Work in connection with the erection of 86 flats in Croydon Road by the Council's Contractors was commenced in September. 1.

Towards the end of the year a meeting of local food traders was convened by the Penge and Anerley Chamber of Commerce in regard to a Clean Food Campaign and the formulation of local "Codes of Practice" for traders. Early in 1950 an independent clean food association was formed and Codes of Practice drawn up by them. In January, 1950, the Council recommended the adoption of bye-laws based on those suggested by the Ministry of Food. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Whilst it has not been found necessary to take action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, there were occasions when difficulty was experienced in obtaining admission to institutions of aged persons suffering from chronic illness, and in need of care and attention. Until sufficient institutional accommodation and staff are provided for the chronic aged sick, particularly those living alone, the proper care of these elderly people will remain a problem. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their cordial support during the year, and also to the staff of the Public Health Department for their ready co-operation. I am, Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, B. E. HAWKINS, Medical Officer of Health. 12 Notifiable Diseases (other than Tuberculosis) during the Year 1949.

Town Hall, Anerley Road, S.E.20. June, 1950. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report on the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for the year ended 31st December, 1949. There was again a large number of complaints received regarding defects and nuisances in houses. Considering the high cost of building repairs it is gratifying to report that a large amount of repair work has been done during the year as will be seen on reference to the list of work executed. A great deal of work, however, is still necessary to bring many houses in the district up to a reasonable standard of fitness. Once again delay was occasioned in many cases in executing repairs required by notices owing to the prolonged negotiations between owners of property and the War Damage Commission regarding war damage claims. Owners were reluctant to put in hand any work until settlement was reached with the Commission. Every effort is made by informal action to get repairs done, but I regret to have to report that it was necessary to institute legal proceedings against certain owners in order to abate nuisances caused by housing defects. The following is a summary of these cases :— Case No. Result. 1. Occupying premises without water supply when prohibited from so doing by Order of Court. Fined 5s. per day for 75 days (£18 15s. Od.) and £1 Is. Od. costs. (a) Further summons regarding the above for continued occupation. Cases adjourned on non-appearance of Defendant and warrant issued for her arrest. (b) Further hearing of case when it was reported the water supply had been reinstated. The prohibition order was therefore withdrawn. 2. Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined 5s. per day for 40 days (£10) and £1 Is. Od. costs. (a) Further summons for continued non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Defendant did not appear and warrant issued for his arrest. (b) Fined 3s. per day for 33 days (£4 19s. Od.) and £1 Is. Od. costs and Court costs. Owner subsequently completed works required. 16 Case No. Result. 3. Nuisance Order made to do work in 28 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 4. Nuisance Order made to do work in 28 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 5. Nuisance Order made to do work in 7 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. 6. Nuisance Order made to do work in 28 days and pay £1 10s. 6d. costs. (a) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £1 0s. Od. and Is. 5d. costs. Council did work in default. 7. Nuisance Order made to do work in 14 days and pay £1 9s. 6d. costs. (a) Non-compliance with Nuisance Order. Fined £2 0s. Od. Legal proceedings were taken against an occupier for failing to keep his premises clean.- A Nuisance Order was made to abate the nuisance within 7 days. In addition to verbal intimation of defects found in premises, 876 written informal notices and 65 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Eight hundred and eleven intimation notices and 62 statutory notices were complied with. The Local Authority carried out, in default of the owners, the works required by one statutory notice served under Section 39 and two under Section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1936. The Council also did the work required by seven notices served under Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers at 10 premises. A Demolition Order respecting one house was made under Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1936. Closing Orders were made under Section 12 of the Housing Act, 1936, in respect of three underground rooms at two houses which could not be made fit for human habitation at a reasonable cost. The drainage systems of 46 houses were wholly or partially relaid and 85 cleared of obstructions. Under the Rent Restrictions Acts, certificates were issued in respect of two houses that were not in a reasonable state of repair. Five licences to deal in game were issued during the year.

The supervision of premises and stalls where foods are prepared, stored or exposed for sale, has been regularly carried out. Defects found at 21 food premises were remedied. The provision of washing accommodation at the public convenience in the High Street during the year has provided a most desirable facility for the traders in the street market and appreciation thereof has been expressed by them. Your Inspectors gave advice to the occupiers of food premises on matters relating to food hygiene and found that food traders, generally speaking, were anxious to co-operate. The amount of food surrendered and condemned as unfit for human food, after examination by your Inspectors, was 10 tons, 16cwts., 1 qr., 16 lbs., a large proportion of which was at a food manufacturing factory. The foods condemned were as follows:— Apples 45 lbs. Bacon 11,773 „ Beef 597 „ Cakes 10 „ Cheese 70 „ Dried Eggs 1/4 „ Dried Milk .. .. 392 „ Figs 2 „ Fish 1,754 „ Flour .. .. .. 21 „ Grapes .. .. .. 8 „ Jam and Marmalade 5 „ Meat pies .. .. 1 „ Mutton and Lamb .. 609 „ Offal 277 „ Ox tongues .. .. 210 „ Pickles .. .. .. 1 jar Pork .. .. 60 lbs.

All milk is retailed in sealed containers. 20 Milk (Special Designations) Orders. The following licences were issued:— Dealers' Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 4 Pasteurised milk 5 Sterilised milk 9 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin tested milk 5 Pasteurised milk 6 Sterilised milk 5 Milk Sampling. Informal samples of milk submitted to chemical analysis totalled 61. Four were found to be very slightly deficient in solids not fat and three slightly deficient in fat. Further samples in these cases proved satisfactory. The analyses of the 61 samples show the following averages:Fat—3.47% (standard 3.0%). Solids not fat—8.80% (standard 8.5%). Twenty-six samples were taken for the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase Tests and with one exception satisfied the tests. Two further samples in the latter case proved satisfactory. One sample of sterilised milk satisfied the turbidity test. Ice Cream. There are no manufacturers in the district, but a large number of premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream. Thirty-nine samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the Methylene Blue Test with the following results :— • Grade 1—7 ; Grade 2—19 ; Grade 3—13 ; Grade 4—Nil ; In no case were samples found to be consistently below Grade 2, and in all cases temperatures did not exceed 28°F. During the year the Ministry of Food made available additional supplies of sugar and in certain cases fat, to those manufacturers who undertook that their ice-cream should have a minimum fat content of 2½%. Forty samples were submitted to analysis for fat content, and all were found to contain more than 2½% fat, the results ranging from 2.8% to 11.4%. These samples show a wide disparity in food value. It is to be hoped that when suitable ingredients for the manufacture of ice-cream become more readily available a satisfactory fat content standard will be required for the sale of this popular foodstuff. 21 Slaughter Houses. No animals were killed at slaughterhouses within the district. Bakehouses. The last of the underground bakehouses in the district was the subject of an adverse report. The Council therefore decided to withdraw the Certificate of Suitability. The occupiers' appeal to the Court of Summary Jurisdiction against this decision was adjourned for some months to enable them to make satisfactory alterations to the bakehouse. Adulteration. The Kent County Council Sampling Officers took 159 samples of various foods in this district. Included in the total were 50 samples of milk, 9 butter, 9 margarine, 6 cooking fat, 5 sausage, 4 whisky, 4 gin, and 17 drugs. Four of the 159 samples were found to be of inferior quality and two adulterated. Legal proceedings were not taken. Factories Act, 1937. Visits paid to factories totalled 170, and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, 22 written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with minor defects. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, and Infestation Order S.R.O., 1943. Complaints received from various parts of the district and investigated numbered 347. When considered necessary, the drains of premises were tested with smoke and any defects found made good. In no case was a major infestation found. The foul-water sewers were treated on two occasions during June and December, pre-bait and poisoned bait being laid in the manholes and side entrances. In June 298 manholes were baited and pre-bait takes recorded in 154. The figures for December were 309 manholes baited and prebait takes recorded in 175. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of the work carried out by him at premises in the district :— Premises surveyed 2,972 Premises reported infested with rats 347 Premises treated for rats 394 Premises where rat poison bait taken 342 Premises re-treated 308 Estimated number of rats poisoned 1,754 Number of rats trapped 20 Premises treated for mice 149 It was necessary to treat some premises on three or more occasions and the total treatments for destruction of rodents numbered 984. 22 Shops Acts, 1912 to 1938.
