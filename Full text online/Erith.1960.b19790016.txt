The Registrar-General's estimate of the mid-year population is 45,780 (45,700 in 1959). The vital statistics supplied ant.ually by the General Register Office and dealt with below indicate that, broadly speaking, the health of the Borough was well maintained. The standardised death rate for 1960 was 11.63 per th thousand of the home population (11.8 in 1959) compared with 11.5 per thousand for England and Wales. The standardised birth rate was 15.73 per thousand estimated home population (15.08 in 1959) compared with a rate of 17.1 per thousand for the country as a whole. 14 infants died during the first year of life giving an infant mortality rate of 19.44 per thousand live births (13.06 in 1959) compared with 219 per thousand in England and Wales. Ail but four of the infantile deaths were due to congenital abnormalities and prematurity over which there is little control at present. For the second successive year there was no maternal death associated with childbirth. Bearing in mind that during this period there were 1.409 total births in the area, it may be said that the result reflects the efficiency of the antenatal and obstetrical services as well as the greater degree of control over puerperal infections made possible by the use of the antibiotics and chemo-therapeutic substances. In regard to the infectious diseases, it is pleasing to report that, for the eleventh year in succession, there has been no case of diphtheria in the Borough. It is, nevertheless, a duty that the public should be constantly reminded of the possible return of this disease should the level of immunisation fall to a sufficiently low level. Already there have been signs of a recrudescence of the disease in various pjrts ot the country and, while there were no deaths from thic cause in England and Wales during 1959, there were two deaths m 5 1960 and seven deaths in the first seven months of 1961. Parents would be well advised to heed this warning and ensure that their children are kept fully immunised. For the second year in succession no case of poliomyelitis occurred in the Borough. There can be little doubt that this satisfactory result is, substantially, due to the intensive poliomyelitis vaccination of children and young adults in recent years. A further interesting development which may have far-reaching consequences is the introduction of a new type of vaccine which is given by the mouth (oral vaccine). It is evident from extensive trials carried out in various parts of the world that it is both safe and effective. In the meantime, it behoves all parents and all adults within the approved age limit (at present 40 years) to avail themselves to the fullest extent, both for their children and for themselves, of the fully-tried procedure at present in use which is known to be at least 90 per cent effective for those persons receiving three or more doses. During 1960, there were 39 deaths from cancer of the lung—the highest number recorded in the Borough in any one year. The annual figures for the previous nine years were 20,16, 16, 13, 18, 17, 21, 22 and 24. The increased incidence and associated mortality are, of course, a national problem. It is now ten years since the first publication of evidence in this country, of the close association between cancer of the lung and heavy cigarette smoking and there must be few people from the age of 15 years and upwards who are not aware of the danger; and yet the consumption of cigarettes goes up and up. The report of the Commissioners of H.M. Customs and Excise, for the year ended 31st March, 1960, indicates that the big increase in tobacco smoking in Britain sent the Customs and Excise revenue up, during that year, 7 £52 million to £788 million—the department's highest single revenue rise. Tobacco clearances for consumption rose by more than 17 million lbs. to 262 million lbs. and the report makes it clear that the increase was due, in the main, to an increased consumer demand. It may be of some use to re-state the facts. The consump™ of tobacco rose from 1 ly million lbs. in 1900 to over 225 million lbs. in 1958. In 1900, deaths from lung cancer were eight per million of the population—in 1958, 440 per million. In the past eight years' 125,000 deaths have occurred from lung cancer in England and Wales alone—many more than all accidental deaths on the roads, in the home and in industry. 6 Publicity has failed. In any case it has been quuc inadequate when compared with the skilful and sustained propaganda for smoking conducted by the tobacco industry —much of it directed at the adolescent boy and girl to whom smoking is presented as something fine and glamorous and a sign of maturity. It would be wrong, in spite of public apathy, to drop this subject and accept the consequents. It is hoped that the wise person will, progressively, cut down his cigarettes or, better still, give them up altogether, 01 change over to a pipe which is considered to be less dangerous. During 1960 a concentrated mass x-ray survey was carried out in Erith, Bexley andi Crayford (total population 166,800) in conjunction with the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The results of this survey are given in the body of the report. It will be seen that 35,250 people were x-rayed (Erith 9,690) but it should be stated that an additional seven thousand were x-rayed in factories just prior to the campaign in order to free the units from some of their routine work. Further, the fact that a high proportion of local residents work in London ensures that many are x-rayed by units operating in different parts of the metropolis. A diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made in 169 cases (Erith 61) of which 57 (Erith 18) required close supervision or treatment — an incidence of 1.6 per thousand x-rayed. The total number x-rayed, however, includes 16,040 persons who had not previously been x-rayed and these show an incidence for tuberculosis of 2.7 per thousand x-rayed. One can agree, therefore, with the statement made in the Survey report by Dr. J. M. Morgan, Director of the SouthEast London Mass X-Ray Service that "an important step has been made in reducing the number of unrecognised cases in the area surveyed." He continues, "It seems unlikely, however, that more than 60 per cent of adult residents in the areas have been examined in the last five years, including those who have been x-rayed elsewhere and in an effort to reach the remaining 40 per cent, a mass radiography unit is visiting Bexleyheath weekly, and it is hoped that it will prove possible to persuade a substantial number of this unexamined group to attend." Persons attending this weekly session are, in the main, referred by their private doctors and these attendances are, therefore, more selective than is the case in ordinary mass radiography sessions. I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Council for their encouragement and assistance in carrying 7 out this survey and the innumerable people who worked so hard on the organisation of the campaign. For a fuller account of the latter, reference is made to the report issued by the Director of the South-East London Mass X-Ray Service from the New Cross General Hospital, S.E.14. The work of the Bexley, Erith and Crayford Home Safety Committee continued during the year and, with the grant now being received from the Local Health Authority, has increased in scope. However, this is time-consuming work and must, at present, be fitted into the general work of the Health Department. This makes a really sustained effort a matter of some difficulty. It may be that the appointment of a part-time Home Safety Organiser for the three areas covered by the Committee would be one way of solving the difficulty. In conclusion I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I am, Your obedient servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health. 8 Annual Report 1960 SECTION A:—STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA A (1) Physical Situation and Amenities Erith is situated in the north-west corner of Kent, and is bounded on the north-east by the River Thames to which it has a frontage of about 4 miles: on the west by the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich and the Borough of Bexley, and on the south by the Borough of Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford. The shopping facilities are advantageously situated having regard to the disposition of the six wards in the Borough, and there is a copious supply of pure water which is provided and maintained by the Metropolitan Water Board. The chief industries are light engineering, edible oil refining, manufacture of chemicals, coal shipping and lighterage, and the production of building materials, i.e. stoneware drain pipes and asbestos components. The manufacture of television and radio equipment, and toys, are also well established industries. As in other years, industrial expansion has continued. 9 A (2) Comparative Rainfall 1959 1960 Month.

The idea of a Mass X-Ray Campaign for the Boroughs of Erith and Bexley and the Urban District of Crayford arose out of a report entitled "No Time for Complacency," issued in May, 1958 by the South East London Mass Radiography Service and which covered the area of South East London and North West Kent. The report indicated that, although great improvements had taken place in recent years in the treatment of tuberculosis, there was little evidence that this progress had yet effected a material decrease in the incidence of new cases of tuberculosis or in the size of the reservoir of long-standing tuberculosis cases within the community. The figure relating to the incidence of tuberculosis per 1,000 x-rayed for the three towns appeared to provide "prima facie" evidence that further action was indicated and the Councils of Erith, Bexley and Crayford readily agreed to co-operate with the Mass Radiography Service in planning a comprehensive survey on the lines of the one carried out in Glasgow in 1957. The area under review. Erith, Bexley and Crayford are three contiguous towns forming part of Metropolitan Kent. The mid-year populations (as estimated by the Registrar General) were:— Erith 45,700 Bexley 90,500 Crayford 30,600 Total 166,800 These figures are for the total population in the area, but the Mass X-Ray Campaign was only concerned with the ambulant adult population. A full account of the Campaign has been published as a separate report and may be obtained from Dr. J. M. Morgan, Director, South-East London Mass X-Ray Service. 'New Cross General Hospital, Avonley Road, London, S.E.14. The following statistics relating to the Survey are extracted from the main report. Certain observations on these findings are made in the Foreword on page 6. 25 TUBERCULOSIS AND NEOPLASMS OF LUNG Borough of Residence Totals X-rayed Tuberculous cases requiring close supervision or treatment Tuberculous cases requiring occasional supervision.

C (11) Mortuary Owing to the retirement on 4th April, 1960, of the Coroner's Officer who, for the past ten years had been providing technical assistance for the pathologists, H.M. Coroner decided that bodies should be diverted to the mortuary at the West Hill Hospital, Dartford. Consequently the Bexley mortuary was not used from 4th April, 1960, until the end of the year. During the first three months of the year the mortuary accommodated 52 bodies, and post-mortem examinations were carried out in 52 cases. 12 inquests were held. 17 bodies were from the Erith area and post-mortem examinations were carried out in each case There were 4 inquests. C (12) Disinfection and Disinfestation of Bedding, Clothing, etc, A joint arrangement is in existence with the Bexley Borough Council for the disinfection and disinfestation of bedling, clothing, etc. There is, also, a cleansing station for dealing with verminous persons.

D (1) Refuse Collection and Disposal The method of storage is by means of sanitary dustbins, and some 19,500 are emptied weekly. The dustbins are provided and maintained by the owners of the properties concerned, the Council securing this by a local Act—the Erith Improvement Act, 1920. Disposal by barging under contract ceased on 20th August, 1960. Refuse is now transferred from collection vehicles to larger transporting vehicles at a transfer depot, and disposal is effected by tipping at Stone. D (l)a Costs £ s. d.

Corporation sewers have been extended to take the drainage of recently developed housing estates, and in some cases, sewers have been enlarged. Of domestic cesspools, 17 are known to exist, and these are subject to regular cleansing and emptying accordance with the resolution of the Council dated 10th March, 1942. During the year, one cesspool was abandoned. 37 D (5)e Atmospheric Pollution Results of Analysis (A) The Erith Borough Council is represented on the Thames-side Advisory Committee for the Abatement of Atmospheric Pollution. In this connection, a deposit gauge, lead peroxide gauge, and a smoke recorder are respectively in various positions, and the analysis of the contents of these guages for 1960 are as follows:— Month Deposit gauge Lead peroxide gauge Sulphur mg/100 sq .cms/day Rain in inches Insoluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Soluble deposit Tons per sq. mile Total Solids Tons per sq. mile Calcium Tons per sq. mile J«nuary 1.41 8.85 8.32 17.17 1.41 3.10 February 1.39 10.07 7.75 17.82 1.41 2.39 March 1.21 11.78 13.49 25.27 2.95 2.72 April 0.35 5.54 4.75 10.29 0.94 1.44 May 2.16 11.24 9.80 21.04 1.96 1.28 June 0.82 5.21 4.90 10.11 0.96 0.85 July 1.93 4.88 3.09 7.97 0.38 0.54 August 3.85 6.90 10.20 17.10 1.42 0.72 September 4.19 7.47 10.20 17.67 1.98 1.37 October 5.05 7.73 11.07 18.80 2.12 1.72 November 3.15 3.36 4.83 8.19 0.41 1.95 December 2.32 9.89 6.58 16.47 1.05 2.95 Monthly average for 1959 17.44 1.76 2.07 (B) The combined smoke filter and sulpher dioxide apparatus which has been in operation at the Town Hall since July 1958 has been maintained by the Department throughout the year, and readings and results thereof have been carried out and recorded daily. Appended below are particulars of the highest recorded figures for the year ended 31st December, 1960:— Smoke: Smog level Sulpher dioxide: Smog level (200 mgs. black suspended (40 parts per 100 million matter per 100 cu. metres of air) parts of air) 101.0 on Jan. 7th. 37.0 on Dec. 9th. Highest reading 1959 Highest reading 1959 135.2 on Jan. 30th 77.6 on Jan. 30th. (C) Resulting from a nuisance due to toxic fumes discharged from a resin factory, it was necessary for a Town Planning notice to be served against which the authors of the nuisance gave notice of appeal, which was subsequently abandoned, The effect was that the Town Planning Enforcement notice became operative, and in June 1960, the manufacture of phthalic anhydride ceased. This event thus obviated statutory action which was pending under section 93 of the Public Health Act, 1936. 38 The emission of toxic and other types of fumes from industrial premises is a problem with no easy solution. In many instances the Public Health Act is of little value because of the difficulty of assessing the extent of a nuisance on a particular occasion, that the emission is injurious to health, or that a specific plant is responsible. Furthermore, the provisions of the Clean Air Act and the Alkali Act being limited in their application, it has been found that control is likely to be best achieved by refusal of planning permission, or by imposing appropriate conditions on certain manufacturing processes. (D) During the period under review the 44 feet high coal grading screen at the local coal wharf was dismantled and removed from the site. It was from the top of this shaker screen that the emission of coal dust was extremely difficult to control without resorting to elaborate precautionary measures, and now resulting from the cessation of high altitude screening, the uniform height of all hoppers on the wharf is 22 feet. (E) Continuous oil fired kilns are gradually replacing the intermittent type at a local clay industry premises, and this is resulting in a great reduction of smoke production. At this site also, hand firing boiler plant has been superseded by oil combustion. (F) The substitution of aero paint sprays by electrostatic sprays (Ransburg process) has resulted in a considerable reduction of fumes being emitted from a local factory. (G) During the year a Pratt Daniel dust arrester was adjusted and its water circuit was improved at a foundry. D(5)f The Clean Air Act 1956 No. 1 Smoke Control Area which comprises the whole of the Bostall Ward is an area of some 390 acres in which are situated the following buildings:— 3,234 dwellings, 32 shops, 4 places of worship, 1 public library, 1 public house, 1 convent school, 1 County Council school. The provisional plan received Ministerial approval on 12th November, 1959, subsequent to which a house-to-house inspection has been made throughout the area, and the requisite information collated. At the end of the year, 196 premises were yet to be inspected, and on the completion of the inspections, all the acquired data will be analyse so that the total cost of the scheme can be ascertained. 39 National Survey of Air Pollution. At the end of the year, the organisation of a national survey of air pollution which was suggested by a Working Party of Local Authority representatives and Government technical experts was well advanced, the object being to obtain comprehensive detail which will present a quantative aspect of the pattern of air pollution generally. For this purpose, towns will be classified within categories according to domestic and industrial coal consumption in consideration of their geographical situations, and from each category it is proposed to select about 100 towns in all from which samples will be taken to provide a statistically valid picture. D (5)g Swimming Baths and Pools (1) The Council's open air bath is situated in Stonewood Road, and comprises one pool of 55,000 gallons capacity which is now exclusively used by the Kent County Education Committee during normal school hours, and local youth clubs during the evenings and on Saturdays. Water in the pool is heated to a temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit by low pressure steam heating and is sterilised by the chlorine process. There is a slipper bath establishment with accommodation for 16 males, and 4 females. Adjacent to the bath, is a mechanical laundry which launders on behalf of the various undertakings in the locality and which include the Corporation's Catering Dept., Works Dept., the County Health and Education Depts., and the Royal Alfred Seaman's Home. During the year, 85,586 articles were laundered. Attendances at the Swimming Baths for 1960. Swimming pool Slipper baths Schools: During term 13,710 Schools: During holidays 2,745 Youth Clubs 16,455 Total Total for 1960 32,910 for 1960 15,332 Total Total for 1959 26,837 for 1959 15,812 (2) A childrens' paddling pool of 60,000 gallons capacity is situated within the Belvedere recreation ground at Woolwich Road, and this is a popular rendezvous during the summer months. 40 The pool is regularly emptied and cleansed during the period it is in use, and methodically dosed with chloros. A successful model power boat regatta sponsored by a local model engineering society is held at this site and is always well attended. D (5)h Offensive Trades Other than 10 fish frying establishments, there are no other scheduled offensive trades under Section 107 of the Public Health Act 1936 in the Borough. Fish frying was declared to be an offensive trade on 17th March 1939, and bye-laws were made accordingly. All the fish frying businesses are well conducted and the frying apparatus at each is of modern and approved pattern. D (5)i Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act 1951 There are now three registered premises in the Borough in which filling materials as defined in the Act are used. The Act is designed to secure that clean filling materials are used in the upholstery trade, and applies to manufacturers' and dealers' premises alike. The three persons operating businesses are dealers, and in addition to regular inspections made at their premises, samples have been obtained and submitted to the Prescribed Analyst for the purpose of testing. A typical Report is as follows:— T ests Results Chlorine content 7 parts per 100,000 Oil content 1.2% Soap content 0.8% 2.0% Soluble impurities (1) 1.4% (2) 1.4% (3) 1.5% Average 1.4% Remarks:—Sample satisfactory. D (5)j Pet Animals Act 1951 There are four pet animals shops in the Borough at which a wide variety of domestic pets can be purchased. All the premises are well conducted and no conditions contrary to welfare provisions have been observed. 41 D (5)k Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 Under the above Act, which came into operation on 29th August, only one site consisting of one half acre of land will be subject to licensing. The three caravans concerned occupy a site which has been used for 40 years. During the year, the area has been free from indiscriminate caravan squatters. D (5)1 Hop pickers There are no hop fields in the district. D (5)m Rodent control Two fully trained operatives are employed to deal with rodent infestations at commercial, private and Corporation premises. The number of premises inspected and treated during the year is as follows:— Commercial premises 34 Dwellings 123 In March and September a total of 104 Corporation sewer manholes (inclusive of a 10% test) was subjected to pre-baiting as a result of which nine manholes were found to be infested, and these were successfully treated with baits consisting of oatmeal, sugar, oil, warfarin and added preservative. In conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a survey was made at a local oil works which is the only known black rat reservoir in the Borough, when it was found that the best practicable means were being employed with a view to keeping the premises free from major infestation. At this source also, an exhaustive investigation was made into the possibilities of black rats being conveyed to different parts of the country by means of road transport, but having regard to all the circumstances, it was considered that the chances were remote. During the year, a fine specimen of Rattus rattus (an outsize black rat) was secured by trapping, and sent to the Ministry of Agriculture's Research Laboratory at Tolworth for experimental purposes. 42 The Prevention of Damage by Pests (application to Shipping) Order, 1951, applies to the many wharfs, jetties and dry slipways in the Borough, and was implemented by the following visits and inspections being made:— Commercial barges 46 Town's refuse barges 15 Coastwise vessels 21 Tugs 13 Oil tankers 9 Miscellaneous craft 3 No marine infestations were located during the year. D (5)n Pest control. For matters which are outside the scope of the statutory provisions of the Public Health Act, the practical assistance of the Department's outdoor service is available to occupiers who need such help, in particular having regard to choked waste pipes and drains, and the destruction of wasp nests. The income arising from the above service amounted to £50 9s. 6d. which represents the cost of materials, etc., used and the apportionment charge on the operative's time. A suspected Colorado Beetle which was submitted for identification was found to be Amphimallus (a summer chafer). D (5)o Eradication of Bed Bugs Vermin infestations continue to decrease and the number of dwellings treated during the year is as follows:— Privately owned houses 0 Corporation houses 7 Occupiers are encouraged to reveal promptly any signs of infestation so that the menace can be eradicated in its initial stages. D (5)p Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act 1952 and Regulations 1953 Almost without exception, heating appliances sold in shops have a guarantee attached which declares that the fitments comply with the requirements of the above Act and Regulations. With a view of ensuring that gas and eletric appliances did comply however, the probe test was applied to 161 fitments, when it was found that all were satisfactory. 43 Special attention was devoted to appliances found to be on sale at second-hand establishments. The Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960 comes into force on the 1st January, 1961 and this Act empowers the Secretary of State to make Regulations as to the standards to be observed in respect of oil heaters and requiring such appliances to bear instructions for their use. The Regulations in question are awaited. D (5)q Mosquito Control The many ditches which intersect the Belvedere and Abbey Wood marsh area have been kept under constant review and in the spring of the year, such watercourses were treated with D.D.T. and Lindane. Good control was thereby maintained and no complaints were received. D(5)r Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956. Sections 3 and 5 of the above Act place duties on Local Authorities in connection with the provision of sanitary conveniences at farms and similar premises. Of such premises, very few exist in the Borough, but each is served with suitable sanitary accommodation. The premises in question are kept under review, and the necessary return has been made to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. D (6) Shops Act 1950 The following Closing Orders are in operation in the area:— Closing hour (1) Erith Weekly Half-Holiday (No. 1) Order dated 17th Feb., 1913. Thursday, 1 p.m. (2) Erith Hairdressers & Barbers Shops Closing Order dated 11th March, 1947. Every evening, 7 p.m. (a) No partial exemption orders with regard to Sunday trading provided for by section 48 of the Shops Act, 1950, exist. (b) The majority of unmixed trade shops in the Borough close at 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m (c) No legal proceedings were instituted during the year, but on four occasions it was found necessary to draw the attention of shop-keepers to the provisions regarding Sunday trading. 44 (d) During the early part of the year, inspections revealed that carpet sales were taking place at premises other than shops, and at times which were contrary to hours prescribed by the Shops Act, 1950. In two instances it was necessary to forbid sales taking place altogether because the sessions were arranged for Thursday afternoons, whilst in three other cases, the adjustment of the closing hour from 9 p.m. to 8 p.m. effected compliance with the statute. (e) The application of section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 resulted in the following improvements at shops being effected:— Heating facilities provided or renewed 8 Washing facilities improved 6 Lighting improved 3 Seats provided 8 Sanitary conveniences 9 D (7) Sanitary Accommodation at Offices In accordance with the requirements of section 46 of the Public Health Act, 1936, all new offices constructed in the developing area at Belvedere were provided with suitable and sufficient sanitary accommodation. D (8) Street Trading There is no established street trading in the Borough, there being only three mobile stalls sited in the shopping area. No nuisances have been located at this source. D (9) River Pollution. Clean Rivers (Estuaries and Tidal Waters) Act, 1960. This Act came into operation on 29th September and enacts that River Boards will decide whether any new discharge of sewage or trade effluent can be made into tidal rivers, and to what extent it must be purified first. The Minister of Housing & Local Government will decide cases in dispute and Sea Fishery committees and Port and Harbour authorities will be consulted where their interests are affected. 45 The Schedule to the Act lists all the rivers of England and Wales, except the River Thames where the Port of London Authority already has powers. For the first time since 1956, no complaints have been received regarding objectionable odours arising from the River Thames, and a review of the results of inspections at various river-side sites throughout the year would indicate that there has been a considerable improvement so far as turbidity and sewage odour are concerned. Whether at long last, the River Thames is in the process of being adequately cleansed, remains to be seen, but it can definitely be said that the improvement manifested during 1960 has been much appreciated locally, especially by residents and visitors to the Borough who have been able to enjoy the amenities of the Corporation's Riverside Gardens. D (10) Flooding Resulting from exceptional rainfall on 2nd August, flooding incidents were localised and minor in character. In no instance was it found necessary to have to render material assistance other than that of removing obstructions from a number of choked interceptors. On 7th August when heavy rainfall inundated roads in the Metropolitan Boroughs, no flooding incidents occurred in the Borough. D (11) Council Refuse Tip. The disposal of town's refuse by barging across the River Thames to Essex was discontinued in August, since which date incidental tipping has taken place on Council land at Manor Road. The site in question is kept under constant review, particular attention being paid to rodent and vermin infestations. 46 D (12) Factories Acts 1937 to 1959.

Housing Act 1957 Sec 2 and Ministry Circular 2/60. In accordance with the provisions of the above Act and Circular dated 27th January, 1960, a preliminary survey was duly carried out, as a result of which a total of 82 Privately owned houses and 18 Corporation properties were scheduled as probably needing to be dealt with under sections 17 or 42 of the Housing Act, thus forming the basis tor a second 5 year plan. 50 D(14) Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1958. (1) Breaches of Mortgage conditions. Irregularities on the part of certain residents have been investigated by the Public Health Inspectors during the year, in particular with regard to overcrowding and attempts to sub-let mortgaged property. Whilst in each case the investigation has been completed satisfactorily, some occupants however have been found to be extremely elusive and talented in effecting a rapid dispersal whilst inspections have been in progress. With a view to coping with situations such as these, it is suggested that rent books should declare the precise names of the permitted occupants, so that they can be identified on the site. (2) Discretionary Grants. These are available for a wide range of improvements which enable houses built before 1945 to be thoroughly modernised. To qualify for grant, houses must be brought up to a requisite standard of comfort and after improvement they must:— 1. be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp. 2. have each room properly lighted and ventilated. 3. have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the house. 4. be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes. 5. have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet. 6. have a fixed bath or shower in a separate room. 7. be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water. 8. have a proper drainage system. 9. be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available). 10. be provided with adequate facilities for heating. 11. have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food. 12. have proper provision for the storage of fuel where required. Dwellings after improvement should have a useful life of at least 30 years. During the period under review 49 Discretionary grant applications were approved. 51 D(15). The House Purchase and Housing Act 1959. Standard Grants. These grants are available in respect of improvements of dwellings built before 1945, by provision of the following amenities: — (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom, (b) a wash-hand basin, (c) a hot water supply, (d) a water closet in, or contiguous to the dwelling, (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. Dwellings subject to these grants should remain fit and available for use as dwellings for a period of not less than 15 years. During the period under review, 36 Standard grant applications were approved. D(16). The Rent Act 1957. The majority of enquiries regarding this Act are made by tenants desirous of effecting rent reductions on account of items of disrepair, but considerable assistance has been given to tenants regarding information on de-control and tenancy agreement matters. In these respects each case is dealt with on its merits. Action under the Act is enumerated below: — (1) Number of applications for Certificates of Disrepair 11 (2) Number of Certificates issued 1 (3) Number of Revocations applied for 9 (4) Number of Revocations granted 7 No appeals, either by landlords or by tenants against Local Authority decisions were made to the County Court during the year. 52 SECTION E— WATER SUPPLY—MILK—FOOD AND DRUGS ACT—FOOD INSPECTION E (1) Water supply The Borough is served throughout by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water containing some 30.8 degrees of hardness. Almost without exception, the supply is led direct into the premises served. Twenty four samples drawn from various points in the district have been forwarded to the appropriate Laboratory for bacteriological examination, with satisfactory results. E (2) Milk supply E(2)a Food and Drugs Act 1955. Section 37. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified areas) Order 1951. In pursuance of the above Order which has operated since 1st October 1951, all milk which is retailed in the Borough is specially designated. E (2)b The Milk (Snecial Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954. The Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. The designations applicable to milk sold in the Borough are limited to "Pasteurised," "Sterilised," and Tuberculin Tested." Pasteurised milk must be bottled at the premises at which it is heat treated. There are no pasteurising plants and milk bottling establishments within the Borough. E (2)c Bacteriological examination of milk The following samples of designated milk from various sources and retailed in the Borough were obtained and submitted for examination:— Pasteurised 15 Sterilised 1 Tuberculin Tested 5 21 All satisfied the prescribed tests. 53 E (2)d Milk (Special Designation) Regulations 1960. Designated milk licences. Details of dealers' licences to use a special designation in relation to milk which is obtained and sold pre-packed by the dealer are as follows:— Pasteurised 19 Sterilised 36 Tuberculin tested 11 Total 66 E (2)e Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959. Dairies and milkshops The register of dairies and milk shops records the following registrations:— No. of registered distributors 12 No. of dairies 4 No. of milkshops 36 No. of producer/retailers 0 Regular inspections have been made at the above throughout the year. E (2)f Ice-Cream 126 premises in the Borough are registered for the sale of ice-cream. There are 3 active manufacturers of ice-cream (2 boil mix and 1 cold mix). The Ice-cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959. Bacteriological sampling. Six samples were obtained and forwarded for bacteriological examination with the following results:— Grade 1 5 Grade 2 1 54 E (3) Meat and Food Inspection E (3)a Slaughterhouses Act and Regulations 1958. There is one slaughterhouse in the Borough, and in pursuance of the above Statute, the requisite Slaughterhouse Report was duly submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 5th August, 1960 with a recommendation that the "appointed day" should be 31st August, 1962, but, at the request of the Minister, this date was amended to 1st October, 1962. In this regard, a copy of the Slaughterhouse Report was forwarded to the slaughterhouse licencee with a request that early attention should be given to the carrying out of the works required. As will be seen from the following prescribed tabulation, in addition to other animals, 33,787 pigs were slaughtered and inspected during the year, and in this connection, a 100% inspection has been possible only by one of the three Public Health Inspectors as per rota, being engaged full time on meat inspection each week. Thus it will be seen that meat inspection duties at the slaughterhouse is equivalent to the whole time service of an Inspector, and as in other years, slaughtering has taken place daily and inclusive of every Saturday and Sunday. Until legislation makes provision for regulating and stabilising hours of slaughter, it would appear that the present exacting situation is likely to continue. 55 The following table in prescribed form details the number of carcases inspected and condemned: — Carcases and offal inspected and condemned in whole or in part. Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Horses Number killed 950 235 459 5543 33787 - Number inspected 950 235 459 5543 33787 - All diseases except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci. Whole carcases condemned - - - - 25 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 132 36 3 128 1226 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than tuberculosis and cysticerci 13.89% 15.32% 0.65% 2.31% 3.70% - Tuberculosis only. Whole carcases condemned - - - - 1 - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned - - - - 59 - Percentage of the number inspected affected with Tuberculosis - - - - 0.18% - Cysticercosis. Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 2 - - - - - Carcases submitted to treatment by refrigeration 2 - - - - - Generalised and totally condemned - - - - - - Total weight of meat at slaughterhouses found to be diseased and unfit, and consequently destroyed:—4 tons, 8 cwts., 1 qtr., 0 lbs. 56 E (3)b Tuberculosis (Area Eradication) Order 1950. On the 1st October, 1960, the whole of England and Wales was declared an attested area and the final stage of eradication of bovine tuberculosis was reached. Kent reached attested area status on 1st October, 1958, but some reactors to the tuberculin test are still found in herds in the county. These reactors are slaughtered under the Tuberculosis (Slaughter of Reactors) Order, 1950, and normally a post-mortem examination is carried out by a veterinary officer of the Animal Health Division in me slaughterhouse receiving such reactors. When lesions of tuberculosis are found in bovines during the normal course of meat inspection by Public Health Inspectors, the Animal Health Division of the Ministry at Maidstone is notified so that veterinary officers are enabled to identify the animals concerned, trace back to the herd of origin, and impose restrictions on that herd, inclusive of carrying out tuberculin tests. E (3)c Foot and Mouth Disease. Of the total of 298 outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease during 1960, none occurred at the slaughterhouse, and all livestock premises in the Borough remained free from infection. In view of the proximity of Foot and Mouth Diesease which existed in neighbouring areas, it was necessary to exercise the utmost surveillance of animals which were slaughtered and inspected at the private slaughterhouse. E (3)d Other Foods. Considerable time and attention has been devoted to the inspection of food in shops and stores, as a result of which the following was found to be unfit for human consumption, and consequently destroyed: — cwts. qtrs. lbs. Meat 1 0 24 Fruit 1 1 12 Cheese 1 3 14 Fats 1 0 7 Vegetables - - 12 Vinegar - - 22½ Tinned Goods 5 0 9½ Total 10 3 17 57 E (3)c Disposal of Unsound Meat and other Food. Meat (Staining and Sterilisation) Regulations 1960. With the coming into force of the above Regulations, as there are no sterilising facilities for unfit meat at the slaughterhouse, such meat is stained with naphthaline green, and removed by arrangement for sterilisation elsewhere. The residue of unsound food, inclusive of tinned goods is disposed of with the town's refuse. E (3)f Slaughter of Animals Act 1958.

The Foods Standards Committee which was set up in 1947 to advise the appropriate Ministries on the exercise of their powers under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, was reconstituted in 1960 and during the period under review recommendations have been made by that Committee for control over the composition, description, labelling and advertising of bread and flour. It is now proposed that there should be a statutory list of ingredients, that the description of "protein" breads and slimming claims in connection with bread should be controlled, and that exaggerated claims for enrichment of bread, or for energy producing qualities, should be prohibited. E(5) Food Hygiene. The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. These Regulations made under sections 13 and 123 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, came into operation on 1st October, 1960 for the purpose of amending and consolidating the Food Hygiene Regulations 1955 to 1957, and for extending statutory action to the handling and service of food on board "home going ships" and certain other vessels. In addition to the above, two new codes of practice, i.e. (a) Hygiene in the retail fish trade and (b) The Hygienic transport and handling of fish were issued in September jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The codes have no statutory force and are not intended as an interpretation of the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations. 1960. The Food Hygiene Advisory Council which was set up under section 82 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, to advise the Minister has, however, approved the codes whose main object is to give guidance to persons in the trade who are responsible for compliance with the Regulations. During the year, considerable time and attention has been devoted to food shops and food prepared therein, and considerable improvements have been effected, particularly with regard to refrigeration. All the public houses in the Borough have been inspec- as a result of which many sanitary improvements have been carried out, and where necessary, recommendations have been made to improve food service. 60 Number of food premises in Borough, (a) Registered under Statute.
