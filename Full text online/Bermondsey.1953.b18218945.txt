Staples Borough of Bermondsey. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Bermondsey. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit my Annual Report for the year 1953. The health of the community has remained generally good, and the details of the mortality and morbidity statistics, together with information on the varied work carried out by the Public Health Department may be found in the body of the Report. The population of the Borough, again, shows a slight decrease in spite of the rehousing by the London County Council in their new estates of housing applicants from outside this area. More attention is being paid to the needs of the aged, particularly those home-bound and chronic sick persons who seem to be the responsibility of neither the Hospital Services nor the Welfare Department of the London County Council. As a result of the responsibilities placed upon the Public Health Department by the Council, every effort can now be made to mitigate the sad circumstances of most elderly persons who, while needing some attention, cannot be admitted to a hospital or old people's home. In 1953 the Borough suffered its second severe flood disaster in 25 years. Although high tide was not expected until 3.5 a.m. on the morning of the 1st February, by 2 a.m. considerable quantities of water were flowing in the Tooley Street and Rotherhithe Street areas. The flooding affected over 150 dwellings, the water entering some houses to a depth of 2 feet. Inspection of these premises was made by the Sanitary Inspectors who took a complete inventory of the furniture and articles affected. Arrangements were made for the larger articles of furniture and bedding to be dried and cleaned in the Disinfecting Station. With the valuable assistance of the W.V.S. and R.B.C.S., clean bedding and blankets were provided. The Department co-operated with the Mayor, the War Damage Commission, and the owners of the damaged properties, in examining claims for the replacement of damaged furniture and for the repair of damaged houses, and schedules were prepared by the staff of the losses of foodstuffs sustained by individual shopkeepers and of the damage occurring to foodstuffs lying at the wharves, including large quantities of figs, dates, rice, flour and dried egg. Soap and soda were issued from the Department's stock to those householders whose homes were affected by the flooding. Whilst the flooding was not so severe as that which occurred in 1928, it was nevertheless necessary to utilise the resources of the Department to the utmost. The means adopted to meet the emergency proved efficient and satisfactory. Proposed new legislation will, if enacted, add considerably to the duties and responsibilities of the Department, and much thought is now being given to the most effective means of absorbing the additional work involved. In conclusion, I am glad of this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to the Mayor and the Members of the Public Health Committee, and also Members of other Committees of the Council for their active interest in all matters concerned with the welfare of the Department. I desire also to thank members of the staff for their co-operation and loyal assistance. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, D. M. CONNAN. VITAL STATISTICS. AREA.

This designation seems to have served the very useful purpose of eliminating from this area the host of unlicensed traders who used to frequent it, and has incidentally saved the staff and the police considerable trouble and the Council considerable expenditure in connection with the many prosecutions that had to be instituted against these traders for street trading offences.

Some of these, mainly of the small cafe and snack bar type, are in premises not entirely suitable for carrying on such a business. Progress has been made in effecting improvements of a permanent nature but, in a number of cases, the structure and lay-out of the premises does not permit of any serious attempt at improvement; fortunately housing clearance schemes are gradually leading to the demolition of many of them. Cleanliness, however, does not depend on chromium plate and tiling and, although modern materials and easily cleaned floor and wall surfaces are a great help, it is the will, energy and knowledge of the management and staff that are the governing factors. In order to supplement the legislation controlling the preparation and sale of food and with the realisation that if persons employed in the food trades had a better appreciation of the dangers of food poisoning that can arise through careless food handling and dirty personal habits, a programme of lectures to food traders (mainly in the catering trades) was started in 1951. These lectures, which are illustrated by films and exhibits of various kinds, have been held each winter since then. They have been only moderately supported but those who have shown enough interest to come along have, I think, profited and it is hoped that every person employed in food handling in the Borough will eventually attend. A certificate is awarded to those who regularly attend a full course of four lectures. A number of local authorities have set up Clean Food Guilds by which food traders can voluntarily subscribe to a set of rules, or code of practice, of a somewhat higher standard than that required by law but in Bermondsey it is not considered opportune to establish such a Guild at present for the following reasons: — (1) The traders themselves have shown little interest in such a scheme. (2) The legal standards are, for reasons already given, difficult to attain in all circumstances. (3) Impending legislation, i.e., the Food and Drugs (Amendment) Bill at present before Parliament may provide a code of practice for food traders as useful as any voluntary arrangement between the Council and the traders. On page 44 of the report are set out details of prosecutions taken against food traders for such things as selling a loaf of bread containing a used finger bandage and a meat pie covered with a green mould. These are obvious instances of careless handling and bad storage of food, two of the most likely causes of food poisoning. Happenings of this nature serve as an index of the care with which food is handled and give an urgency to our task which is to raise the standard of cleanliness in all operations involving the handling of the food we eat. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE As a result of discussions between representatives of the Council for the Welfare of Old People and the Bermondsey Borough Council, the Public Health Committee appointed 6 of its members as representatives of the Borough Council on the Executive Committee of the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Council for the Welfare of Old People, and the Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee, Councillor Mrs. A. M. Hatcher, was elected Chairman of the Old People's Welfare Committee. A member of the staff of the Public Health Department undertook responsibility for the administrative and secretarial work of the Welfare Council. Under the powers given by Section 4 of the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937, the Borough Council has taken over nominal control of, and financial responsibility for, Old People's Clubs. Each club has a voluntary leader and voluntary helpers, and is entirely selfgoverning. The Public Health Department makes all the arrangements for handicrafts, singing, and film shows given by the Department's Propaganda Section. Holidays at reduced rates are arranged for the aged, the Borough Council meeting the cost of transport for club members who take advantage of these arrangements. The Welfare Council have, in some cases, rendered financial assistance where the old person would have had some difficulty in meeting the whole of the cost. The Corporation at Margate have offered facilities to old people on holiday for concerts, outdoor games, and the use of deck chairs for the nominal charge of 1/- per week. The Welfare Council have always maintained a close friendship with a number of Women's Institutes in the Home Counties and during the summer months a number of coach outings to the various institutes was arranged for members of the Old People's Clubs, and the Institutes were most generous with their hospitality. Clubs have their meetings in Church Halls or in buildings under the control of the Borough Council. Times of meetings are as follows:— Arthur's Mission, Snowsfields, S.E.I. } Leader : Miss M. A. Hanbury, B.R.C.S. } Thursda y , 2.30- 4 P.m. Dockhead House, 225 Abbey Street,} S.E.1.} Leader:Mrs. F. L. Manser.} Thursday, 2.30-4 p.m. Lady Gomm, Hawkstone Road, S.E.16 } Leader: Mrs. I.

Bliss.} Wednesday, 2.30-4 p.m. Other old people's clubs affiliated to the Welfare Council are: Bermondsey Central Hall, S.E.1. Tuesday. Bermondsey Medical Mission, Grange Road, S.E.I. Monday and Friday. Bermondsey Settlement, Farncombe } Street, S.E.16.} Thursday. St. George's Hall, Old Kent Road, TO} S.E.1. Wednesday. The closer co-operation with the Borough Council has, indeed, been justified during the past year, and the relationship between the various voluntary organisations and the Council has been cordial. Mutual assistance has been ready and friendly, and in the future much can be done to improve the lot of old people living in this Borough. Meals Service At the beginning of February, 1953, the delivery of meals which had previously been undertaken by volunteers of the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Council for the Welfare of Old People was taken over by the Department. The service hitherto provided by the voluntary workers comprised two deliveries per week to an average of 12 old people, and with the limited equipment at their disposal the service was, to quote themselves, far from satisfactory, their main difficulty being the keeping of food warm until the last meal was delivered. It was felt that if the Borough Council supplied services in lieu of the monetary grants previously made to the Council for the Welfare of Old People, this would be more beneficial to the old people and, by using existing facilities, provide more service at less cost. At the last audit the District Auditor queried whether the provision of services and the debiting of the cost to a voluntary organisation could be, under Section 31, National Assistance Act 1948, a " contribution to the funds of any voluntary organisation." The Ministry of Housing and Local Government have sanctioned the expenditure for the year under audit and for the year ending 31st March, 1954. The Ministry have under consideration the question of the continuance of the scheme by this method of costing. A number of surplus United States Army food containers, specially insulated for heat retention, were purchased and it was found that if the food was dished up immediately it was cooked, on to really hot plates and placed in the containers which had already been heated with boiling water, the food retained its heat for quite a long time. On enquiry it was found that most old people required meals on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday only, as their meat ration was enough for the weekend with invariably a little left over for Monday. On 3rd February 1953, the first delivery was made by Borough Council staff and transport. Seventeen meals were delivered to homebound old people and bulk food was taken to three clubs, where it was served up by volunteers to club members. By August the three clubs had closed, due either to lack of customers or lack of volunteer servitors. Every effort was made to include in the home delivery scheme any necessitous cases who still required meals and who were deprived of them owing to the clubs closing down. The number of meals delivered to homes had by now increased to about 40 per day, and this number has been maintained for the rest of the year. It has been found that 40 is the maximum number which can be delivered with one unit comprising a van, driver, and female attendant. Our clientele is ever changing for various reasons; some die, others are taken to hospital and for this reason it is necessary that regular visits be made. Although no claim will be made that the meals improve health or extend the expectation of life, there is nevertheless no doubt whatsoever that the old people derive tremendous pleasure from the fact that there is something to look forward to in most of their remaining days, if not the meal then the knowledge that someone who has their interests at heart will be calling on them. In the Autumn of the year a quantity of packet tea and sugar was received from a Bermondsey school for distribution to homebound old people, the Headmaster of the school having recommended his scholars to take gifts of this nature to school for their Harvest Festival instead of the customary fruit, flowers and vegetables. The commodities were distributed a little at a time and were received with very grateful thanks, being the most useful type of gift to make to old people: they all, without exception, enjoy a cup of tea. Each packet was accompanied by a neatly written, nicely worded, little note from its donor. During the Christmas Holiday the London County Council Kitchen which supplies the food was closed and in order to ensure that the old people had a Christmas Dinner, forty frozen dinners, comprising roast turkey, stuffing, brussels sprouts, creamed potatoes, and Christmas pudding, were purchased by the Council for the Welfare of Old People and distributed on Christmas Eve, together with a parcel of sweets, a Christmas card, and a handshake by the Secretary of the Council for the Welfare of Old People and a member of the staff. One customer, a lady of 78 years whose husband had died and whose children had moved away, was experiencing that common complaint of old people, loneliness. After a very active life in local affairs, she was rendered homebound by chronic arthritis: her depression got to such a state that it was felt necessary to recommend her for admission to an Old People's Home. A vacancy was found in one of the London County Council's smaller Homes and I have since heard from her to the effect that she is happier than she has ever been in her life. The staff of the Department have also taken on various extra voluntary duties, such as arranging chiropody, obtaining and supplying wireless sets, distributing gifts of clothing, flowers, food, etc., and many other little persona l matters have been attended to where necessary. PROPAGANDA. Propaganda work has been carried on during 1953 in a manner similar to that in past years. Almost every organisation holding meetings in the borough has been visited at least once a month and a film display or lecture given. The film programmes, which consist of two or three documentary films of general interest and one on a health subject, continue to be very popular. Most modern 16 mm. films are extremely good, both in production and technique. Many are made in colour which is so necessary for dealing with certain subjects and present day speech recording on 16 mm. film makes it possible to reproduce the almost perfect lecture without a lecturer being present. Two courses of lectures were arranged during the year to further the clean handling of food campaign. Owners and staffs of local catering establishments were invited to attend. Each course consisted of four lectures given by the inspector in charge of this work, each lecture being illustrated with film strips and films ROAD SAFETY Once again this department has been able to assist the Road Safety Sub-Committee with film displays designed to introduce road safety propaganda. The monthly shows in two of the borough halls during the winter months have attracted good audiences. CIVIL DEFENCE Assistance has been given to the Civil Defence Corps and also to local firms' own civil defence groups with recruiting and training films. The following lectures and film displays were given during the year: No. Attendance Clean Handling of Food 9 181 Youth Clubs and Children's Organisations 34 3,130 Adult Organisations 49 1,415 3,635 Old Folks' Clubs 60 4,920 Road Safety Film Displays 24 345 Civil Defence 8 12,626 184
