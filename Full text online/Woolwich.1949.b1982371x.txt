Walsh PREFACE To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of WoolmIch. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Forty-ninth Annual Report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. The Report is prepared along the lines indicated by the Minister of Health. I am pleased to state that during 1949 the general health of the Borough was maintained at a satisfactory level. There has been a steady increase in the population of the Borough since 1944 ; the Registrar-General's estimate of the civilian population in mid 1949 was 144,000, being an increase of 1,200 on the 1948 figure. The total population, i.e., civilians and non-civilians, is now estimated to be 149,200. An examination of the vital statistics shows that the birth rate (17.4) continues to fall from the post-war maximum rate of 22.8 in 1947, but nevertheless the rate for the Borough is higher than at any time between the years 1927 and 1941. The death rate (10.9) is the lowest for Woolwich since 1938 (10.4) and compares very favourably with that for England and Wales (11.7) and for the Administrative County of London (12.2). It is pleasing to record an infant mortality rate of 28.7, which is the second lowest rate for the Borough. In 1949 there have been fewer deaths in Woolwich of children under one year than during any of the preceding seven years. For the fourth year in succession the maternal mortality rate was less than 5 per 1,000 births. The incidence of infectious disease was again low. Notifications showed a marked decrease in numbers with two exceptions, those of tuberculosis and poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis). Tuberculosis is still a great social problem. However, in Woolwich, whilst there is no room for complacency, there has recently been a substantial drop in the number of deaths from this disease. This decrease became much more apparent in 1949, i.e., there were 59 deaths in 1949 compared with 82 in 1948 and 101 in 1947, giving a death rate from tuberculosis of .41, compared 3 with .57 in 1948 and .72 in 1947. The number of cases of tuberculosis remains high, probably to some extent accounted for by the increased use of the chest clinics and other facilities available for the early detection of the disease. The general insufficiency of institutional beds for tuberculosis cases continues. However, the opening during the year at the Brook General Hospital of a new isolation ward is a most welcome development locally. The increasing use in this country of B.C.G. vaccine as a protection against infection is a new factor in fighting the disease which should show the beneficial results indicated by Continental experience. At the present time the vaccine is being made available primarily to hospital and nursing staffs, those constantly exposed to infection and similar special groups. Poliomyelitis, which continues to present difficult problems, occurred in epidemic form over the country during the summer months of 1949. In Woolwich, there were 25 confirmed cases—the highest number on record and slightly more than during the 1947 epidemic. Two cases proved fatal, but I am pleased to say that 18 patients made a complete recovery. The year 1949 was notable for the low incidence of whooping cough and there was also a drop in measles notifications. During April and May cases of smallpox were reported in the London area. Precautions were taken locally and many contacts of a suspected case were kept under observation. Diphtheria, which was a major problem in the years between the wars, has now become a comparatively rare disease. Only 11 years ago there were 507 confirmed cases in Woolwich alone, with 8 deaths occurring from this disease. The total confirmed cases numbered only 8 during 1949 and there were no deaths ascribed to this disease. This rapid fall has coincided with the immunisation campaign carried out on a large scale during the past few years. The housing situation is one of particular difficulty. That part of the Report dealing with sanitary administration shows that much work has been done in the remedying of defects and in the abatement of nuisances associated with housing. At the end of the year Woolwich still had a clear lead over other metropolitan boroughs in the post-war provision of houses. The number of complaints of sanitary defects has increased. It is not difficult to find the cause. There are a large number of older type houses in the Borough, particularly in the Woolwich and Plumstead districts, which now require increasing maintenance work to keep them in a reasonable state of repair. Investigation of complaints and repeated visits within a short period has accounted for a large proportion of the sanitary inspectors' time, and it has not yet been possible to carry out house-to-house inspections on a large scale. It is hoped that the time is not far distant when the process of clearing the Borough of its substandard property can be recommenced; The Council at the end of the year made an approach to the London County Council for the transference to the Council of the Lord Warwick Street Clearance area for representation and subsequent development. Those inspectors responsible for the inspection and supervision of the food supplies have experienced a particularly busy year. Progress can be reported in the work of securing a satisfactory level of hygiene among kitchen staffs and other food handlers. Personal contact with such workers is of the utmost importance and usually has the desired results. Draft food by-laws based on the series of model by-laws issued during the year by the Ministry of Food, and which it is hoped will shortly be made applicable to London, should be of assistance in the work of exercising a greater control in the handling and sale of food. 4 There has been a decided improvement in the bacteriological purity of ice cream, due in some measure to the regular supervision of these premises and to the advice given by the Council's sanitary inspectors. Owing to a large increase in the number of sheep, lamps and pigs for slaughter in the Borough, some 10,000 more carcases were inspected by officers of the Council than in the previous year. An important step in the progress towards the elimination of tuberculous cattle and in the campaign for " safe milk " was taken during the year, with the coming into force of the Milk (Special Designations) Act, which is designed to ensure that milk sold in this country is free from tuberculosis germs. In Woolwich, practically all the milk sold is already Tuberculin Tested, Pasteurised or Sterilised. Measures to combat the mosquito nuisance were again taken in 1949. The Council's rodent scheme was in full operation throughout the year. In accordance with the scheme agreed with the London County Council and the Borough Council, I have continued to act for the local health authority in the day-to-day administration of their personal health services. Co-operation between the local health authority and the sanitary authority in the administration of the health services in the Borough has obvious advantages, and I am pleased to say that liaison between the County Council and ourselves is excellent. I desire specially to acknowledge the continued confidence and support which I have received from the Council. I take this opportunity also of thanking every member of the staff for the valuable work they have done during the year and for the help they have given me personally. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRING, Medical Officer of Health.

After correction for inward and outward transfers, the nett number of Woolwich live births was 2,504, 1,280 being males and 1,224 females. It is known that 1,135 births took place in Institutions in the Borough. The birth rate was 17.4 compared with 22.8 in 1947 and 17.7 in 1948. For the year 1949 the birth rate for England and Wales was 16.7, and for the Administrative County of London, 18.5. In addition, there were 38 still births, 21 being males and 17 females. Natural Increase in Population {i.e., excess of births over deaths). In 1947 the natural increase in population was 1,567 ; in 1948, 954 ; in 1949, 932 ; compared with 465 in 1937 ; 483 in 1938 ; and 541 in 1939. Deaths. The number of deaths registered in Woolwich was 1,244, the nett number of Woolwich deaths being 1,572, giving a death rate of 10.9 for the Borough. Deaths of Woolwich residents in hospitals in the Borough totalled 280, whilst 288 died in other hospitals within the London area and 153 in hospitals outside London. The Registrar-General supplies a factor by which the crude death rate should be multiplied in order that the local death rate may be compared with the crude death rate of the country. The adjusting factor for Woolwich was .93, giving, when so multiplied, an adjusted death rate of 10.1. In the following table, this figure is compared locally and nationally. Table No. 2. Deaths.

During the year, 30,590 inspections, including re-inspections, were carried out by the sanitary inspectors. The nature of these inspections is shown in Table No. 6 and details of nuisances abated are given in Table No. 7. The number of intimation notices served as a result was 2,616, and the number of statutory notices, 1,201. In 29 instances legal proceedings were found to be necessary. 10 Table No. 6.—Inspections.

The necessary action was taken where defects or nuisances were discovered. Water Supply. The Metropolitan Water Board is responsible for the water supply for all domestic purposes in the Borough, all dwelling houses being supplied direct from the public water mains. Wells. There are now only eight wells in use in the Borough, and these are used chiefly for trade and kindred purposes. One private spring in the Woolwich Borough is at Conduit Meadows, Eltham. There are three private deep wells used for trade purposes and also deep wells at the Council's Woolwich and Plumstead Baths and at the refuse destructor plant at Plumstead. Another deep well, the supply from which is unfit for drinking, is situate in the Royal Dockyard. Other wells within the Borough have been sealed off and there is no access to them. Drainage. The inspection of new drains is carried out by the Borough Engineer and reconstruction and repair of drainage work supervised by the Health Department. During the year repairs to 260 drains were carried out. Twenty drainage systems and 6 combined drainage systems were reconstructed. Smoke Abatement. During the year 36 observations were made on factory chimneys in the Borough and in two cases offences were committed. In one of these cases the nuisance was abated forthwith and in the other the emission of smoke was still the subject of correspondence between the Council and the owners of the factory at the end of the year. At the annual meeting of the National Smoke Abatement Society, at which the Council was represented, a resolution was passed : " That the Minister of Health be requested to make a condition of qualification for their approval of new housing schemes or for the issue of a licence in respect of houses built by private enterprise, that any solid fuel-burning appliances proposed to be installed should be on the Government's list of approved appliances." The Council supported this resolution. Rag Flock. Rag flock must comply with the Rag Flock Regulations, 1912, in which it is laid down that soluble chlorine in the form of chlorides must not exceed 30 parts of chlorine in 100,000 parts of flock. The Public Analyst reported that the three samples submitted for analysis during the year conformed to the standard of cleanliness laid down in the Regulations, the number of parts of chlorine being 11, 8 and 9 respectively. 11 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. This Act places upon Metropolitan Borough Councils the duty of enforcing the provisions of that part of the Act which relates to poisons in Part II of the Poisons List. One hundred and three applications were received during the year for retention in the Council's list. In addition, 13 new entries were made and visits were carried out to premises of all listed sellers. Shops Act, 1934. The Council, in its capacity as sanitary authority, has duties under this Act of securing and maintaining sanitary and hygienic conditions in shops. The number of inspections made during the year was 940 and 16 notices for offences under the Act were served. Offensive Trades. During the year, the Council approved an application for the renewal of one tripe boiler licence. There is one other offensive trade—that of slaughterer of poultry, carried on within the Borough, and the Council in 1948 approved the re-establishment of this business. Legal Proceedings. During 1949 it was necessary to institute legal proceedings in 22 cases, in order to obtain compliance with notices served by the sanitary inspectors. A total of 26 summonses were served. Of these 11 were withdrawn or adjourned sine die, as at the time of the Hearing the necessary work had been put in hand. Of the remainder, the Magistrate made 9 Abatement Orders and imposed fines and costs amounting to £18 15s. 6d. In five cases it was necessary to issue further summonses for non compliance with Abatement Orders. Of these, 3 were adjourned as the necessary work had been put in hand. In the remaining 2 summonses, fines and costs amounting to £17 2s. Od. were imposed by the Magistrate. There were two summonses issued regarding the deficiency of meat in sausages. A total of £11 3s. Od. in fines and costs was imposed. Common Lodging Houses. These are licensed annually by the Borough Council in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. There are now only two licensed Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. The number of inspections made during the year was 16. Details of the accommodation available are as follows :— Premises. Accommodation (Men). 60, Beresford Street 50 102, Woolwich High Street 22 Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts. During the year 7 applications for the issue of a certificate under the provisions of the above Acts were considered by the Health Committee and in 6 cases a certificate that the premises were not in a reasonable state of repair was issued. The Committee also considered two applications for revocation of existing certificates of unfitness and authorised the issue of one such certificate on being satisfied that the necessary repairs to put the house in a reasonable state of repair had been executed. Mosquito Control. Breeding grounds for mosquitoes are provided by the marshland areas in the Borough. In Abbey Wood, the area nearest to the marshland, considerable annoyance has been caused by this pest and extensive spraying operations have been carried out on stagnant ponds, marsh ditches and allotment holders' water butts, reducing this annoyance to a minimum. During the year, fewer complaints were received than during 1948 when climatic conditions were considered to be against the mosquito, and it is felt that the work of the department met with considerable success. Routine spraying is carried out every year in the early summer, as a preventive measure. 12 Factories Act, 1937. Table No. 8. Details of inspections carried out during 1949:— Premises.

Outworkers within the Borough are visited periodically by the sanitary inspectors. The number of outworkers and the nature of the work carried on, in the list prepared in August, 1949, was as follows:— Making, etc. of wearing apparel 100 Cleaning and washing of wearing apparel 37 Lace, lace curtains and nets 2 Locks, latches and keys 2 Racquet and tennis balls 3 Feather sorting 9 13 Eradication of Bed Bugs. In the last Annual Report, the various methods used by the Department in recent years for the eradication of bed bugs, were fully described, and reference was made to the Council's experiments in the search for a disinfectant which would not only kill bugs but which would also provide a residual lethal effect. It was also reported that a new twin-cylinder compressor set, the Aerograph type "A.D.V." had been purchased. This apparatus has been used extensively and excellent results obtained. This type of treatment is a vast improvement when compared with the old methods, as constant refilling is now unnecessary and the highest ceiling can be reached without the use of trestles or ladders. It is also unnecessary to move the whole of the apparatus, as was the case in the use of former types when moving from one room to another. Dry powder or liquid can be sprayed with equal ease and generally the performance has been very good. The fullest co-operation from householders is being obtained in this matter. A letter, giving as much notice as possible of the proposed date of disinfestation, together with advice on preparation for the process and the nature of the treatment, is sent to the householder. In all cases a routine re-inspection of the premises has been carried out to ascertain the degree of success obtained. Prospective tenants of the Council's houses are all visited by the Sanitary Inspector responsible for disinfestation, and 1,134 such visits were made during the year. Upon finding vermin in furniture, a specially equipped Council pantechnicon is used for the removal, and all articles (except bedding, which is treated by steam) are fumigated in the vehicle with hydrogen cyanide gas. When sufficient time has elapsed fully to process and ventilate the contents of the van, the furniture is delivered to the Council house. Fifty such removals were undertaken during 1949 and a further 14 were similarly carried out on behalf of the London County Council. The Council is also called upon, at various times, to assist in the destruction of such pests as cockroaches and beetles, etc., and although the Council is under no obligation to assist in these matters, every assistance is, in fact, given. Treatment with insecticides took place in 15 cases upon an undertaking being given by the householder that a reasonable charge for the work would be paid. Rodent Control. The work of rat destruction was continued throughout the year. The staff engaged on this work consisted of two investigators and four operatives working under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector who devoted the whole of his time to this service. The treatment of private dwellings is generally free. This fact has made the public much more ready to report infestations. Before the scheme commenced, the average number of complaints received during a month was 40. This figure has now increased to approximately 100 per month. All complaints are investigated and the area of infestation defined before treatment is commenced. In addition, a block control scheme is systematically worked throughout the Borough. Where the infestation appears to originate from the drainage system the drains are tested and any defects remedied. The sewers are treated twice a year in addition to an annual test bait, and the Council's refuse destructor and tips are treated monthly. The total number of premises surveyed during the year was 11,045, and the number of inspections amounted to 27,090. Effective preventive measures were taken in 2,286 instances. Guidance to local authorities on methods of treatment continues to be made • available by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Housing. As in previous post-war years, the housing problem, with almost 9,000 applicants outstanding at the year's commencement, has been of the utmost concern to the Council. However, the number of new houses built by Woolwich exceeded that of any other Metropolitan Borough, passing the 2,000 mark of new 14 houses built since the cessation of hostilities and, as the following statistics show, some headway was made in reducing the number of waiting applicants. Actual numbers of new houses built in the Borough during 1949 were:— By Woolwich Borough Council, 386 ; and by private enterprise, 111. In addition, 146 flats erected by the London County Council on the Barnfield Estate became available for letting during the year. Apart from the erection of flats by the London County Council, there were a further 287 houses under construction in the Borough by the Borough Council and by private enterprise at the end of the year. Number of applications on Register at 1st January, 1949 8,809 Number of applications received during year 1,889 10,698 Number of applicants rehoused during year:— (1) By Borough Council 484 (2) Nomination to L.C.C. 58 Nomination to owners of private property 7 (3) Direct by L.C.C. 223 772 9,926 Number of applications cancelled or withdrawn (no reply to Ministry of Health Circular, licences issued under Control of Civil Buildings, applicants moved or found own accommodation) 3,626 Number of applicants on Register at 31st December, 1949 6,300 Properties under Council's control:— At 31st December, 1949, tenancies totalled:— In pre-war houses 4,317 In rebuilt houses 130 In new post-war houses 1,006 In temporary dwellings 986 In S.D.A.A. Properties in Possession 35 In requisitioned properties 1,140 In other properties 103 7,717 The weekly rent roll at the end of 1949 was £7,164 6s. 3d. The above information has been kindly supplied by the Director of Housing. In December, 1949, there were 37,925 houses in the Borough. The number inspected for housing defects under the Public Health or Housing Acts was 6,242. The number found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for habitation was 2,995. Some 2,321 houses were rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the sanitary inspectors, including the service of Intimation Notices. Statutory Notices were served for the first time in respect of 1,229 houses. The work necessitated by the large number of complaints of all descriptions received in 1949, not only made essential the appointment of an additional sanitary inspector, but continued to restrict the number of house-to-house inspections carried out under the Housing (Consolidated) Regulations, 1925. Nevertheless, 397 dwelling houses were inspected under these Regulations compared with 103 in 1948. 15 The Council is under obligation, upon application made by either landlord or occupier, to give in writing the permitted number of persons in respect of any dwelling, and measurements were taken of dwellings on 126 occasions. In all, 261 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions, mainly due to recently married couples being low on the Housing List and having to seek accommodation with their own or other families. Overcrowding reports were made to the London County Council on behalf of these persons, and in 87 such cases alternative accommodation was obtained. At the end of the year only 14 families were still in occupation of huts on vacated Army sites, which they had occupied as squatters. This accommodation is unsatisfactory in spite of works carried out, and as each hut becomes empty it is rendered uninhabitable. Demolition and Closing Orders. Demolition Orders were made in respect of the following unfit houses:— 1, Oak Street 57, John Wilson Street 6, Oak Street 106, Ann Street. The Council made a Closing Order in respect of part of the dwelling house, 37, Escreet Grove. New Houses. The number of certificates issued in respect of new dwelling houses as having a proper and sufficient supply of water was 642. Building Licences. During the year, 2,221 applications for building licences were received by the Borough Engineer and licences were issued in respect of 1,848 of these applications. Burial or Cremation of the Dead. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the Council as sanitary authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died, or been found dead, in their area, where it appears to the Council that no other suitable arrangements have been or are being made. This duty was previously exercisable by the London County Council. Expenses incurred in such burial may be recovered from the estate of the deceased person or from a " liable relative." During the year 1949, the Council arranged for the burial of 10 persons, in each case there being no known relatives of the deceased or the relatives being unable to defray the private funeral costs. The total expenses in respect of the cases amounted to £77. Certain cases dying in hospitals in the Borough are now being buried by the Regional Hospital Board, although where it is possible to recover from a " liable relative," the Council will make the necessary arrangements, as recovery of the costs of such burial from the estate or relatives of the deceased persons under Section 50 of the Act is administered by the local authority. On the 5th July, 1949, a local authority became eligible to receive payment in cases where they have arranged for burial or cremation in respect of any person to whom a death grant under the National Insurance Scheme could be, but has not already been paid. The maximum amount payable in respect of a local authority is three-fifths of the death grant which would be payable in respect of the death of the person concerned. However, men who were over the age of 65 and women who were over the age of 60 on the 5th July, 1948, are excluded from death grant provisions, which limits seriously at present the application of this provision. No such claims were made by the Council during the year. Laboratory Facilities. During 1949, certain pathological and allied work of the Council, i.e., examinations of swimming bath water, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, and ice cream tests, examination of which had previously been carried out by the pathological department of the Woolwich Memorial Hospital, was transferred to the Camberwell Laboratory of the Public Health Laboratory Service. 16 By arrangement with the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee, the examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) continued to be undertaken by the Memorial Hospital. At the time of the change-over the Council emphasised that the work had been most competently performed under the old arrangement, but under the new scheme would be free of direct cost to the Council. At the end of the year, arrangements were made for the Hither Green Laboratory to undertake the transferred work on behalf of the Public Health Laboratory Service. During the year, 259 throat and nasal swabs were examined, 1,389 specimens of sputum, 10 specimens in suspected cases of dysentery, two in suspected cases of typhus, two specimens of urine, one specimen of blood and two rectal swabs. Examination of Swimming Bath Water. Samples of swimming bath water for bacteriological testing are taken monthly and more frequently if found necessary. Twenty-four such samples were submitted for bacteriological examination during 1949 and satisfactory reports were received on all the samples. During the year arrangements were made for the department to carry out its own analytical tests for free chlorine estimation and colorimetric test for the pH value. Mortuary. Public mortuary facilities are provided at the Council's premises at Sunbury Street. These facilities have been little used in recent years owing to the centralisation of Coroners' Courts in London. Welfare of Aged and Infirm Persons. The welfare of elderly and infirm persons in the Borough continues to occupy the attention of the Borough Council and the problem of those people who are living alone is a matter of increasing concern. Over 1,000 visits were made by the Council's inspectors to the homes of these people during 1949. Much valuable assistance has again been given by home helps and the Home Nursing Service. The London County Council hope, by the end of 1950, to complete the erection in the Plumstead area of a home to provide additional accommodation for elderly and infirm persons. A scheme prepared by the County Council also provides for temporary accommodation for those in urgent need. The powers of the Borough Council to deal with the removal to suitable premises of aged persons in need of care and attention, are now derived from Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. It has not been necessary during the year to exercise these powers ; often, suitable provision can be made for such persons without resort to the above Section. Where difficulty is experienced, and in the opinion of the Council removal is necessary in the interests of the persons concerned, or in the interests of the general public, the Council can apply for an Order to a Court requiring removal to suitable premises for a period, in the first instance, of not more than three months. However, action under this Section is limited to those persons who are suffering from a grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapable, are living in insanitary conditions. Acting under the powers conferred by Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, the Council is now giving financial assistance to the Woolwich Council of Social Service, who are operating an " Old People's Lunch Club " at the Central Hall, Plumstead High Street. Approximately 1,600 meals a month are now being served from the Club. Arrangements may be possible for the provision of meals to old people in other areas in the Borough. Welfare Services for Blind and Other Persons. In 1949 the London County Council prepared a scheme which provides for the employment of home visitors whose duties will include teaching blind persons to read embossed literature, giving instruction in pastime occupations, and generally assisting and advising in promoting the welfare of blind persons. 17 The scheme also provides for workshop and home employment in various crafts for remuneration, the marketing of produce, the provision of hostels and the general social welfare of the blind. This scheme includes arrangements for promoting the welfare of partially sighted persons. Street Cleansing and Refuse Disposal. The large area of Woolwich Borough, 8,282 statute acres, necessitates an efficient organisation for the provision of street cleansing and refuse disposal services. Each main thoroughfare is cleansed daily, secondary roads twice per week and district roads once per week, this work employing 86 sweepers. House and trade refuse is collected by the Council's fleet of 18 Pagefield lorries, 88 collectors being formed into gangs for this purpose. During the year under review, 39,526 tons were collected under this system and disposal of this and trade refuse collected and delivered by various tradesmen was effected at the Council's own destructor plant at White Hart Marsh, Plumstead. Here, 45,887 tons were received and sorted. The salvaged material, weighing 2,094 tons, yielded £7,533 when sold. In addition to house refuse collection, raw kitchen waste is collected throughout the sanitary area and concentrated at the Council's plant, for sale as pig food. 3,000 tons of waste were collected during the year and, together with waste obtained from neighbouring boroughs, was sold for £50,692, a valuable contribution to the income of the Borough. A piggery has also been established at White Hart Marsh and, at the end of 1949, 264 pigs were being maintained and fed. During the year, the sale of pigs realised £5,440. Public Conveniences. Fourteen conveniences for men and a similar number for women are maintained throughout the area, hours of opening and closing varying with local requirements. In the town centre, for example, the conveniences are open from 5.30 a.m. Normally, however, this service is available between the hours of 6.30 a.m. and 11 p.m. The information regarding the street cleansing, refuse disposal and public conveniences, has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. Public Baths and Wash-houses. The Council now has four bathing establishments in the Borough, situate at Eltham, Woolwich, Plumstead and North Woolwich. At Eltham there are two modern luxuriously appointed swimming baths which were opened in 1939. During the summer months the larger of the two baths is used for some of the more important national and international swimming competitions and in winter the bath is converted into a public hall and used for various kinds of social functions. A modern pre-cleansing system, and first-class locker system are installed. At Plumstead there is one large and one small swimming bath, 64 slipper baths, a public wash-house fitted with 30 washing stalls and a separate building for Turkish and Russian vapour baths. Conversion of the large bath into a public hall for the promotion of table tennis and badminton functions is effected during the winter months. The indoor bowling green at the Woolwich Baths is a popular attraction during the winter months. At Woolwich there is a first-class swimming bath (capacity 120,000 gallons), a second-class swimming bath (90,000 gallons) and 60 slipper baths. At North Woolwich there are 22 slipper baths. Through the courtesy of the Baths Superintendent, it is possible to present a comparison between the numbers of bathers using the Baths Service in 1937-38 and in 1949-50. So far as the swimming figures are concerned, it should be remembered that the Eltham Baths, which cater exclusively for swimming, were not open during the year 1937-38. 18  1937-38. 1949-50. Swimming 187,246 411,642 Turkish Baths and Massages 23,756 20,246 Slipper Baths 194,298 157,204 Public Wash-house 14,133 13,597 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed — 4,547 419,433 607,236 Filtration plants are installed at the Plumstead, Woolwich and Eltham Baths and the chemical and bacteriological content of the water is regularly examined. Open-air Pools. The two open-air swimming pools in the Borough, in Eltham Park and in the Victoria Gardens, North Woolwich, are provided by the London County Council. Filtration plants have been installed at both these pools. The Borough Council have a paddling pool at the Middle Park Estate, and there is another paddling pool in Eaglesfield, Shooters Hill, belonging to the London County Council. Cemeteries. Three cemeteries are owned by the Woolwich Borough Council and administered by the Town Clerk's Department. These are situate at Eltham and Plumstead, the two in Plumstead being known as Woolwich Cemetery and Plumstead Cemetery. Roughly, each cemetery serves the area after which it is named. The following table gives details of interments during the last three years at these cemeteries:— Table No. 9. Cemetery. Number of Interments. 1947. 1948. 1949. Woolwich 501 474 416 Plumstead 668 623 586 Eltham 354 321 357 Proposed Joint Crematorium. The Council in 1939 decided to establish a crematorium in Eltham Cemetery jointly with the Boroughs of Bexley and Erith and the Urban District Council of Chislehurst and Sidcup, but owing to the war the Council could not proceed. During 1949 the Crayford Urban District Council asked to be included in the scheme, and this was agreed by the constituent authorities. Since the cessation of hostilities the Borough Council has made several approaches to the Minister of Health for sanction to proceed with the scheme, but in view of the need for economy in capital expenditure, it was not possible to obtain sanction to proceed during the year. Churchyards. The parish churches of Woolwich and Eltham, and the old parish church of Plumstead, each have an extensive churchyard, but burials are confined solely to Eltham, where only old vaults and graves are now opened. The parish churchyard of St. Mary's, Woolwich, has been laid out as informal Rest Gardens, and a plan has been submitted for a similar layout of the St. Nicholas' Churchyard, Plumstead, once parish church of Plumstead, with flower beds and seats. 19 River Thames. During the summer months the Council made representations to the London County Council and the Port of London Authority on the offensive smells from the River Thames. The Chief Engineer, London County Council, informed the Council that one of the causes of the smells was the abnormal high average temperature experienced during the summer months. The County Council recognised that the condition of the effluents from the Northern and Southern Outfalls had an important bearing on the matter and informed the Council that an improvement programme of capital works at an estimated cost of £3,000,000 had been adopted and would be put in hand as soon as necessary priorities could be effected. The Chief Engineer stated that he was satisfied that the operational efficiency of the existing equipment at the Outfalls could not be bettered and that no improvement could be attained until the new works came into operation. The General Manager of the Port of London Authority informed the Council that the only permanent solution to the problem was by the complete treatment of sewage prior to its discharge into the river. Representations were made by that Authority to the County Council on these lines and consultations followed with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Parks and Open Spaces. Woolwich is fortunate to have so many parks and open spaces. The Borough has more open space per head of the population than any other Metropolitan Borough, there being six acres of open space for each 1,000 of the population. The Council has always been very active in securing open spaces for its residents. Sixteen open spaces, of considerable size, are maintained throughout the area. Woodlands. At Shooters Hill the Borough has a continuous expanse of woodland, some 312 acres in extent, whilst Bostall Woods is one of the most popular places in London. Children's Recreation Grounds. There are 15 such recreation grounds in the Woolwich area, which must play a considerable part in giving healthy outdoor exercise and in keeping children off the busy roads. HEALTH PROPAGANDA In addition to the normal health education work of the Council's visiting staff and Press publicity, some 500 copies of the journal "Better Health" were distributed each month during the year. This journal is the official magazine of the Central Council for Health Education. During 1949 its lay-out was revised in order to increase its publication appeal. Its contents include articles on personal health and hygiene from the public and personal points of view and it is a valuable aid to public health in these matters. Occasionally, informal talks on health subjects are given to local organisations by the staff of the Department. During the summer months the Council took part in a campaign to prevent nuisances caused by dogs on the footpaths and in close proximity to foodshops. By means of Press publicity and with the cooperation of local shopkeepers, much was done to make the public aware of this nuisance. Posters were displayed in the Borough and 2,000 leaflets were distributed during the campaign. A series of posters provided by the Central Council for Health Education were displayed during the year in prominent positions in the district and the subjects covered were: "Flies," "Clean Hands," "Home Safety," "Early Treatment of Tuberculosis," "Influenza," "Measles," etc. Other posters, both crown and double crown, were in regular use in the Council's establishments. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Milk Supply. The number of registered distributors of milk in the Borough is 71 and there are 5 dairy premises. The Council has also approved the registration of a further 27 distributors of milk who are selling milk in the area from premises 20 outside the Borough. Under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 73 dealers' licences and 27 supplementary licences authorising the use of special designations have been issued. The standard of the milk supply was found to be satisfactory ; practically all the milk distributed in the Borough is heat-treated. All the 423 samples submitted for chemical analysis contained 3 per cent, or more of fat. During the year 259 samples of milk (all pasteurised) were submitted to the Methylene Blue test for the keeping quality of milk and satisfactory reports were received in all cases. Of the 100 samples of pasteurised milk submitted to the Phosphatase test for adequate heat treatment, the test was satisfied in respect of 94 samples. In the six cases where an unsatisfactory report was received, further samples were immediately obtained and were reported as satisfactory. Nine samples of sterilised milk were submitted for turbidity test in accordance with the Milk (Special Designations) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and satisfactory reports were received in each case. Milk (Special Designations) Act, 1949. This Act came into force on the 1st October, 1949, and makes the use of a special designation obligatory for all milk sold by retail for human consumption within certain areas, to be specified from time to time by the Minister of Food. Food and Drugs Authorities are responsible for the execution and enforcement of many of the allied provisions and will have added responsibilities in the specified areas. Until these areas are specified the use of a special designation will remain a voluntary act. Licences are granted on prescribed tests. In addition to the special designations laid down in existing regulations under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, provision is made for a new special designation, "Sterilised" milk. Accredited milk is to be excluded from special designations after October, 1954, and after October, 1957 the special designation "Tuberculin Tested" may only be used in respect of milk from a herd which is on the register of Attested Herds kept by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. Regulations made under the Act provide that licences to producers of raw milk to use a special designation are now granted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, whilst local authorities continue to grant licences to dealers to use a special designation and also issue supplementary licences. Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944. With the coming into force during 1949 of this Act and the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries became responsible for executing and enforcing the Regulations with regard to dairy farms and* for the registration of dairy farms and dairy farmers. Local authorities retain responsibilities for those provisions relating to diseases communicable to man and for the registration of milk distributors, i.e., persons trading from premises other than a dairy farm and for the registration of other dairy premises which are not dairy farms and of dairymen who are not dairy farmers. Local authorities are required to keep a register of all persons carrying on the trade of milk distributor and of all dairy premises (other than dairy farms) in their district. With the coming into force of the Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, Section 22 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, is amended, so that the power of the authority to refuse or cancel registration is extended to all persons who apply to be registered by the authority under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, whether as retail purveyors or not. There are a number of changes in the Regulations relating to buildings, cleansing of vessels and utensils and the distribution of milk and its protection against contamination and infection with disease. 21 Premises where Food is Prepared or Offered for Sale. Amongst there other duties, five inspectors are specially concerned with this work and in the taking of samples under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938 ; the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations ; and the registration of all new premises under the Food and Drugs Act. In addition, routine visits are paid by the district Sanitary Inspectors to all food premises in the Borough and immediate action is taken in regard to any insanitary condition found. Two women Inspectors devote a great deal of time to the inspection of cafes, restaurants, canteens and eating houses. The total number of inspections of food premises during the year was 3,637. In addition to canteens there are some 309 restaurants and eating houses in the Borough. The task of educating the food handler has been carried out by personal contact rather than by public lecture. Generally the trade has responded well to the advice given ; the great majority of those concerned appreciate the importance of a satisfactory standard of hygiene. Food hygiene is discussed with kitchen staff at every possible opportunity. Constant attention is given to the inspection of stalls in the markets. Special inspections of bakehouses are carried out. Inspections during 1949 numbered 53 and 7 Notices were served. Conditions on the whole were satisfactory. On the occasion of the quinquennial review of basement bakehouses carried out in 1948, certificates of suitability were issued in respect of five basement bakehouses. The following is a summary of the registered food premises in the Borough at the end of 1949, together with the number of inspections carried out during the year. Table No. 10. Description. Number in Borough on 31st December. Number of Inspections. Notices. Dairies 4 26 — Distributors of Milk 101 395 5 Ice Cream Premises 238 596 16 Premises where Food is prepared other than above 260 367 27 Restaurants and Eating Houses 309 823 41 Shops and Markets — 1,288 50 Bakehouses 29 53 7 Meat Supply. Slaughterhouses are subject to annual licensing and there are now only two licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough, one of which is not being used at the present time. The Council's food inspectors engaged on the inspection of meat supplies at the Plumstead Abattoir, again had a very busy year. Due to the concentration of slaughtering at these premises, the equivalent of the full-time services of more than three inspectors was required for the inspection of carcases. Compared with the previous year, 10,168 more carcases were inspected in 1949. This was due to a large increase in the number of sheep, lamps and pigs being slaughtered. As the arrival of beasts for slaughter is irregular and as all carcases must be inspected almost immediately after slaughter, the staff were frequently kept late on duty. The following table gives details of the number of animals slaughtered daring 1949. 22 Table No. 11. Carcases Inspected and Condemned, 1949. Cattle, excluding Cows. Cows. Calves. Sheep and Lambs.

However, only 74 whole carcases or 1.3 per cent, of the total number of cattle (other than cows) inspected had to be condemned. In the month of September, the Minister of Food asked local authorities to ensure that while the shortage of meat continues, no meat which is fit for human consumption should be unnecessarily condemned. This has been the practice in Woolwich. Liaison between the Council's inspectors and officers of the Ministry of Food works satisfactorily. Meat Manufacturing Premises. A working party to review the present meat trade practice, legislation governing the meat manufacturing trades and control over the disposal of unfit meat, has been appointed by the Minister of Food. Ministry of Food inspectors co,operate with local authorities in any cases of suspected contraventions of the Food and Drugs Act. Whalemeat. Regulations were made during 1949 prohibiting the importation into England and Wales of whalemeat and whalemeat products for sale for human consumption, unless accompanied by a veterinary certificate certifying that the whalemeat had been inspected and was produced under conditions satisfactory to the Ministry of Food. Provision is also made for securing whalemeat against contamination in shops and on stalls and during transport. The Borough Council is responsible for the enforcement of the Regulations dealing with shops and stalls. Diseases of Animals Act. During August, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurred in the Sidcup area. A " standstill " order was placed on the movement of cattle in an area which included the whole of the Metropolitan district. As a result a large number of pigs (over 1,000 in all) was sent for slaughter to the Plumstead Abattoir by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 23 The Ministry, in consultation with offices of the Council, decided that the carcases could be used for human consumption but that the entrails should be destroyed. As burning at the Plumstead Destructor was inadvisable, due to the proximity to the Council's pig farm and food concentrator, burial at a suitable site at the abattoir was decided upon. A mechanical excavator was required to dig the trench and quick lime was used as dressing. There were no further outbreaks. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933. Eight licences were granted to persons working in the Borough to act as slaughterers. In addition, 9 applications for renewal of existing licences were approved. Ice Cream. Regular supervision of ice cream premises is carried out by the sanitary inspectors and advice is given where necessary, particularly to manufacturers of ice cream. During 1949, 596 inspections of ice cream premises were made. There were 238 registered premises in the Borough at the end of the year, of which 28 were for manufacture. Twelve samples were submitted for grading by the Methylene Blue reduction test. This test assesses the bacterial cleanliness of ice cream. The time taken at 37° C. for complete decolorisation to take place is ascertained and the sample graded according to the following table:— Table No. 12. Grade. Time taken to reduce Methylene Blue. 1 4½ hours or more 2 2½ to 4 hours 3 ½ to 2 hours 4 0. All the twelve samples which were submitted to the test were graded in Grade 2. The provisions of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947, made under the Food and Drugs Act, had not come into full force during 1948 owing to difficulties in the supply of certain essential recording instruments. From a date yet to be appointed by the Minister of Health, it will be necessary in connection with the Regulations to use such indicating and recording thermometers as the local authority consider requisite for indicating and recording the temperatures to, or at which, the mixture is raised, kept or reduced. This interval has been provided in order to give time, where needed, to obtain thermometers. In view of possible difficulties in obtaining cooling apparatus, it has been provided that it shall be a defence for a defendant charged with an offence under the Regulations alleged to have been committed before the 1st May, 1949, that suitable cooling apparatus had been ordered before the date of the alleged offence and that all practical steps had been taken to comply as far as possible with the Regulations. These Regulations provide that ice cream mixtures intended for sale for human consumption shall be raised to, and kept at, a temperature of 150° Fahr. for 30 minutes, or alternatively, at not less than 160° Fahr. for 10 minutes, before freezing. The Regulations do not apply to a "complete cold mix" which is a product capable of being manufactured into ice cream with no addition except that of water. During 1949 the Minister of Food increased the allocation of sugar and fat to manufacturers who gave an undertaking that the fat content of their products would not fall below 2½ per cent. Local Authorities were asked to co-operate by forwarding details of all analyses of ice cream. The Minister pointed out, however, at that time that the minimum fat content of 2½ per cent, did not constitute a " standard " for ice cream. 24 From the month of May, 97 samples of ice cream were obtained and submitted for analysis, the average fat content of the samples taken during each month from May onwards being: 7.2, 7.2, 10.9, 7.1, 8.5, 7.9 and 12.1 respectively. A large number of new applications for registration of ice cream premises were received during the year. Inspections are carried out of all such premises and alterations and additions required as necessary before registration is approved. In several instances it was found necessary to restrict the sale to that of pre-packed ice cream only. Unsound Food. During 1949, 43,737 articles of food, weighing approximately 340 tons, were surrendered as unfit for human consumption. The majority of these articles were from the one large abattoir in the Borough. Most of the food was utilised for animal feeding or for fertilisers. No seizures were made. Sophistication of Food. During the year 910 samples were submitted for analysis to the Public Analyst, including 615 Informal and 295 Formal samples. Of these, 16 Formal samples and 21 Informal samples were reported to be adulterated, giving a percentage of 4.06, compared with 4.5 in 1947 and 3.3 in 1948. The foods examined were:— Ale and Stout 2 Mineral Waters 9 Arrowroot 2 Mustard 2 Aspirins 6 Olive Oil 3 Baking Powder 3 Pastry Mixture 1 Biscuits 2 Pepper 5 Bread 5 Pickles 3 Butter 1 Proprietary Foods 2 Caraway Seeds 1 Puddings—canned 2 Confectionery 53 Rice 1 Cheese 7 Christmas Pudding 2 Saccharin Tablets 1 Cocoa 1 Sago 1 Coffee 17 Salt 2 Cooking Fat 6 Salad Cream 11 Curry Powder 4 Sandwich Spread 4 Custard Powder 6 Sauces Sausages and Sausage Meat 14 14 Epsom Salts 2 Sausage Rolls 2 Fish, canned 13 Semolina 2 Fish Paste 7 Soda bicarb 1 Flavouring Essences 5 Soup, canned 3 Flour 6 Spaghetti, canned 1 Fruit, canned 1 Soya Flour 1 Fruit, dried 6 Suet 1 Ice Cream 121 Tapioca 2 Jam (Marmalade, etc.) 25 Tartaric Acid 1 Tea 1 Lard 1 Tomato Paste, canned 3 Lemonade Powder 6 Vinegar 7 Macaroni 5 Vegetables, canned 4 Magnesia, Milk of 2 Margarine 7 Whisky 2 Meat Products 14 Yeast 1 Milk 423 Yoghourt 1 Milk, condensed 14 Miscellaneous 17 The following table No. 13 gives details of adulterated samples:— 25 26 Table No. 13.

Zymotic Enteritis Although notification of an infectious disease in a house is incumbent not only upon the medical practitioner in attendance but also upon the head of the family or the nearest relative or person in charge of the patient, in fact it is a rare thing for a " lay " notification to be received. If the patient is an inmate of a hospital, in most cases the certificate has to be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the usual residence of the patient is situated, but cases of malaria, dysentery and the acute pneumonias, are always notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the patient is residing at the time he is notified. Diphtheria. There were eight confirmed cases of diphtheria in the Borough during the year and from enquiries made there was evidence that only one patient had been immunised. A child who was originally notified as a case of diphtheria died in hospital; however, the cause of death was attributed to measles. Whooping Cough and Measles. The minor epidemic of whooping cough experienced in 1948 did not recur and the number of notifications of this disease was halved. Measles notifications (1,314) were also less than the number for 1948, some 283 fewer cases being reported. There was one death from whooping cough and two from measles. Scabies. The number of cases notified continues to show a marked decrease, there being only 30 cases compared with 122 in 1948 and 390 in the year 1944. Scarlet Fever. The number of notifications of scarlet fever (203) was slightly lower than the previous year (239) and there were no deaths from this disease. 27 Table No. 14.

It is interesting to compare this percentage with the corresponding percentage for home isolation of this disease during the years between 1930 and 1938, when never more than 7 per cent, of cases of scarlet fever were isolated at home. Frequent visits are made by the district inspectors to these cases in order to ensure that proper precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of this disease. Smallpox. Seven smallpox contacts living or staying in the Borough were kept under daily surveillance following the death from smallpox of a passenger on board the s.s. Mooltan which docked at the Port of London in the month of April. Altogether there were 11 confirmed cases in the country, five of them in the London area, with six fatal cases. A further 22 contacts were also kept under observation until it had been established that the case of which they were contacts was not, in fact, smallpox. Arrangements were made for additional vaccination and all necessary precautions were taken. Woolwich was indeed fortunate that no case of smallpox developed when it is remembered that one of the contacts dined with a friend the evening before the friend developed smallpox. Food Poisoning. There were no serious outbreaks of food poisoning in the Borough during the year 1949. Actual notifications totalled 4 and no deaths were attributed to food poisoning. In the majority of cases of food poisoning, the illness is normally of short duration with symptoms of diarrhoea, abdominal pains and vomiting. Probably only a minority of patients seek medical attention, consequently difficulty in tracing the causal organism with certainty is frequent. In two cases organisms of the Morgan type, probably derived from ham sandwiches, were isolated from the specimens taken from the patients. Another patient was found to be suffering from a Salmonella Typhi Murium infection believed to have been derived from duck or chicken eaten at a meal in a London restaurant. Reports were received that a number of other patients present at this meal (a dinner) were also suffering from food poisoning and that in each case they had eaten a meal consisting of duck or chicken and ice cream. From investigations into a further case of food poisoning, it was ascertained that three members of a family, who had eaten a meal in an hotel, were all ill. The food suspected was meat pie. The Minister of Health in a memorandum to local authorities issued during 1949, stated that, in general, experience during the past 10 years had shown that the notification of food poisoning has achieved the purpose intended, namely, that circumstances requiring further investigation and action of the kind which a general practitioner cannot be expected to undertake are brought promptly to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health. Poliomyelitis. In the years 1947 and 1949, this disease occurred to a greater extent than ever before in this country. In Woolwich there were more cases of poliomyelitis than in any other year on record. The total number of confirmed cases was 25 against 23 in the 1947 epidemic. Of the confirmed cases 18 made a complete recovery, one patient has some paralysis, four patients with more severe paralysis are still in hospital and the remaining two cases were fatal.

The number of primary notifications of tuberculosis was 256, an increase of 24 on the previous year's total. Of the total number of notifications, 224 were in respect of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. There were 59 deaths from tuberculosis during the year as against 82 in 1948. Of the 59 deaths, 55 concerned cases of respiratory tuberculosis. The following table shows the number of notifications, deaths and death rates for the Borough since 1940:— Table No. 15.

The Health Department assisted in this work and circularised local firms inviting them to co-operate by allowing their employees to take advantage of the facilities. Appointments were made by the department, the campaign was widely advertised and the public responded well. Whilst the main object of this examination was, of course, the early detection of tuberculosis, certain other abnormalities may be detected. The Council has duties under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930, concerned with measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, investigations of sources of infection, supervision of the environment of tuberculous persons, together with the keeping of the Notifications Register of all cases in the Borough. The administration of the dispensaries at Eltham and Woolwich is now carried out by the Regional Hospital Board. The Work of the Dispensaries. I am indebted to Dr. E. V. Saunders.Jacobs, the Chest Physician at the Clinics, for the following observations on the work carried out during 1949. The work carried out at the Clinics continues to increase, although there has been little variation in the number of notifications, and a reduction in the number of deaths. This increase in work is attributable to several factors, including the greater awareness on the part of practitioners and the public of the desirability of early investigation and diagnosis ; and the work of the mass radiography units. Also, modern methods of treatment offer greater hope to patients. In addition to the work at the clinics, the clinic staff undertook Artificial Pneumo.thorax refill clinics at the St. Nicholas' Hospital and at the Brook Hospital. X.ray examinations 30 were made principally at the St. Nicholas' Hospital and at the Memorial Hospital, but also at the Brook and Eltham Cottage Hospitals. Domiciliary treatment was carried out in collaboration with the general practitioners, of patients awaiting admission to and on discharge from hospitals and sanatoria. Plans were in preparation for B.C.G. vaccination to be offered to hospital staffs and to child contacts for their protection. The work of the dispensaries during 1949 is shown below in tabular form:— Table No. 16. 1938. 1947. 1949. Number of Primary Notifications 248 297 256 Number of Persons examined for first time 1,312 1,968 2,263 Number of Contacts examined 512 505 473 Number of Contacts found to be Tuberculous 21 14 16 Total number of Attendances 5,415 9,472 12,351 Visits to homes of patients by Chest Physicians 285 92 397 Number of X-ray Examinations 1,156 2,983 4,127 Number of specimens of Sputum examined 1,059 1,191 2,338 Number of specimens of Sputum positive 157 134 184 Number of Cases on register at end of year 874 1,438 1.399 The voluntary Care Committee on which the Borough Council is represented, continued to exercise its function of using the funds at its disposal for the purpose of providing assistance to patients and their relatives in emergencies not covered by other agencies. Help is being given in many ways, including the supply of clothing, shoes, extra nourishment and pocket money, and outings and comforts for elderly patients and children. The funds are derived from interest on investments and donations from both employees of firms in the Borough and from private sources. Thanks are due to the many voluntary workers who collected over £200 by the sale of Christmas Seals. Successful classes have been held twice weekly throughout the year at Maxey Road, for dressmaking and for handicrafts, by the Care Committee in co-operation with the London County Council. Materials for home occupational therapy have also been provided. Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council's Disinfecting Station is situated at White Hart Road, Plumstead, where there are installed two WashingtonLyon steam disinfectors, one steam washing machine and a room for disinfecting articles which cannot be subjected to heat. Infected articles of bedding, clothing, etc. and articles infested with bugs, are disinfected at the station, but personal clothing of persons treated at the two Cleansing Stations is disinfected at these two stations. During 1949, the Department carried out disinfection of 458 rooms in 323 houses after cases of infectious disease, and of these, 77 premises had been occupied by tuberculous persons. Some 3,627 inspections regarding verminous conditions were made and 1,132 rooms were disinfested of vermin. 75 vanloads of furniture were fumigated during the year. 31 The number of articles disinfected at the Disinfecting Station was 6,991, details of the type and number of articles disinfected there being as follows:— Beds 213 Handbags 82 Palliasses 750 Wearing Apparel 459 Pillows 1,416 Boots 2 Bolsters 190 Slippers 10 Quilts 446 Toys 60 Sheets 548 Cushions 217 Blankets 1,318 Library books 140 Curtains 8 Other books 55 Carpets 12 Rugs 11 Sundry other items 1,054 Personal Cleansing. The personal Cleansing Stations are situated adjacent to the Turkish Baths, Plumstead High Street and at the Eltham Hill Health Centre, Sherard Road. Part of the premises at the Turkish Baths was adapted as a Cleansing Station as a temporary measure after the destruction in 1941 of the former Cleansing Station at White Hart Road. Until it is possible to erect a combined cleansing and disinfecting station, the premises at the Turkish Baths have been structurally altered, enabling the service to be more permanent and efficient. The Turkish Baths and the Cleansing Station are each quite separate establishments. The number of persons cleansed was 1,795 (including contacts), and the number treated for scabies was 200. The total number of attendances was 2.129. Details of the number of cases and attendances at the two Cleansing Stations are given below:— Treatment of Verminous Persons. Pre-school Children.

The following information regarding health services has been kindly supplied by the Divisional Medical Officer. The health services transferred to the County Council from the Borough Council under the National Health Service Act, 1946, were maintained during 1949. Attendances at the various sessions were on a level corresponding with those of 1948. So far as maternity and child welfare is concerned, a noteworthy development was the acceptance by the County Council of responsibility for the personal health services in the Woolwich Garrison, including the maternity and child welfare clinic. The services provided are also available to the civilian population ; infant welfare, ante-natal and immunisation and vaccination sessions are held. There was considerable development of the home help service. The number of cases attended on 5th July, 1948 (177) rose to 485 on 31st December, 1949, whilst the number of part-time home helps rose from 91 to 227. The continued popularity of the chiropody service was evident by the demand for treatment. A link-up with the school medical service was provided by the reference of school-children to the foot clinics for the treatment of verucca paedis. By this method early and effective treatment is ensured. On 31st December, 1949, registration had been effected under the provisions of the Nurseries and Child Minders Regulation Act, 1948, of 8 child minders with a capacity for the care of 41 children. Under the County Council's voluntary registration scheme for persons undertaking the care of not more than two children, there were 17 child minders on the panel, 10 of whom were minding children.

In accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946, the London County Council, as local health authority for the Administrative County of London, provides the following ambulance services free of charge:— (a) Accidents and Sudden Illness. For the conveyance to hospital of persons meeting with accidents (in the home or elsewhere) or suffering from sudden illness (in streets, public places or places of employment) within the County of London. The ambulance may be called by private, public or police telephone ; full instructions are given in every telephone box. Where the dialling system is in operation "999" should be dialled and the operator asked for " Ambulance." No charge is made for the use of the telephone if the call is made from a public call-box. (b) Maternity Cases. For the removal of maternity cases to hospitals, etc. Normally, if the expectant mother has booked a bed at a hospital or nursing home, she is in possession of a white card (Form L.A.S. 23) confirming the booking arrangements and giving full instructions for summoning the ambulance. In other cases, where no prior arrangements have been made and urgent admission to hospital is deemed necessary, an ambulance should be summoned by dialling REGent 4000-1; CENtral 6301-2 ; RELiance 3622; WATerloo 6000 or NEW Cross 2645. (c) Analgesia Apparatus. For the delivery to addresses within the County of London of analgesia apparatus. Orders for this service are normally accepted only from the London County Council's domiciliary midwives. (d) Removal of Sick Persons. For the removal to hospitals, etc. of sick persons from any place in London. Full particulars and arrangements for removal can be obtained by telephoning WATerloo 3311 or writing to the Officer-in-Charge, London Ambulance Service, The County Hall, S.E. 1. (e) Facilities in North Woolwich Area. The West Ham Ambulance Service undertakes, on behalf of the London County Council, ambulance work in the two parts of the Borough which lie north of the River Thames. For accidents or sudden illness, an ambulance may be summoned as in (a ) above. Ambulances for the removal of maternity cases and sick persons from these areas are obtainable by telephoning GRAngewood 3050. Services under the Control of the Regional Hospital Board. Since the inception of the National Health Service in July, 1948, the administration of the hospitals and chest clinics in the area has been carried out by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee. I am indebted to the Secretary of the Group Committee for the following information on hospital facilities in the area. 34 The three chief general hospitals serving the district are : the Brook General Hospital, with a bed complement of 644 ; the Memorial Hospital (137 beds) ; and St. Nicholas' Hospital (255 beds). Another hospital serving the area is the Eltham and Mottingham Hospital with 42 beds. The British Hospital for Mothers and Babies, has at the present time a bed complement of 70 [40 at Woolwich and 30 at Paddock Wood (Moatlands) ]. It has been necessary to adopt a system of priorities to ensure that accommodation is available for maternity cases for whom, on medical or social grounds, treatment in hospital is considered to be essential. Owing to a shortage of nursing staff there has been insufficient accommodation available for medical cases and this has resulted in overcrowding in the wards. However, this position has been alleviated to some extent by bringing into use at the Brook General Hospital additional beds for medical cases. At other hospitals the full complement of beds has continued to be staffed. Since July, 1948, three additional wards consisting of 91 beds have been opened at the Brook General Hospital for female medical cases, male pulmonary tuberculosis patients and male surgical cases. Several adaptations (including new X-ray and physiotherapy departments, and new operating theatres) at this hospital are nearing completion. A large number of cases of infectious disease is admitted for treatment at the Brook General Hospital. A small unit of six cots for ophthalmia neonatorum cases has also been opened in the infectious diseases section of the hospital. Cases of poliomyelitis are admitted for treatment at the hospital. Approval to a proposal to build a new out-patient department at the Memorial Hospital has been given by the Ministry of Health, and it is hoped to commence building works during 1950. Further extensions adjacent to the Memorial Hospital are also contemplated. Progress has been made in the purchase of suitable land for the provision of a new out-patient department at St. Nicholas' Hospital. Since July, 1948, it has been possible to bring a further 20 beds into use at the hospital. In-patients are treated for respiratory tuberculosis in all the general hospitals in the area, the majority at the Brook General Hospital. A small number of cases of non-respiratory tuberculosis have also been treated as in-patients. There are no beds in the area for sanatorium or convalescent treatment, but arrangements are made for the admission of suitable patients to sanatoria and convalescent hospitals. In addition to the children's wards in the general hospitals, a special children's unit at Goldie Leigh Hospital, with a bed complement of 266, deals exclusively with dermatological diseases in children who are admitted from all parts of the country. The majority of the major surgical work is being performed at the Memorial and St. Nicholas' Hospitals. In an endeavour to improve arrangements for the admission of cases of emergency, an Admissions Office for the area was opened during 1949 and later the Emergency Bed Service took over the organisation by establishing an area office to assist medical practitioners in this matter. Attendance at hospital out-patient departments in the Borough has greatly increased during the past year. The need for further accommodation in the area for the chronic sick patient is recognised. Orthopaedic clinics for the treatment of fractures, accident cases, etc., have been opened at the St. Nicholas and Eltham and Mottingham Hospitals, in addition to the clinic already functioning at the Memorial Hospital. Hospital dental treatment is given to patients when specially recommended by general practitioners.
