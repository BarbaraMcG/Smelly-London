Sir, Madam, and Gentlemen, In compliance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, I have pleasure in presenting my report on the health and sanitary condition of your district during the year 1899, and more especially, because I am able to point out that its death.rate is 1.4 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the preceding 13 years, and that its general sanitary condition, whether as regards the houses, cowsheds, dairies, workshops and factories, shows a distinct improvement. I would call your particular attention to that part of my report which relates to the housing of the people (pp. 10.17), as this is one of the most difficult questions to be dealt with in Islington, as well as one that daily becomes more acute. I have also to express my personal obligation to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for the kind manner in which they have received my reports and my advice, and to the Clerical and Sanitary Staff, with Mr. Leggatt, the Superintendent, for the readiness with which they carried out my instructions, and the zeal with which they have performed their several duties. I am, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED E. HARRIS, Medical Officer of Health. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, FOR THE YEAR 1898. It is most gratifying to be able to report that the general health, together with the sanitary conditions which prevailed in Islington during the year 1898 were of the most satisfactory character. Thus the death.rate was only 16.5 per 1,000, which, with one exception, is the lowest trustworthy rate on record ; the zymotic death.rate was 2.69 per 1,000, and the infectious sickness case.rate only 7.0 per 1,000 inhabitants, the lowest return since 1891, the year in which notification became compulsory. AREA, POPULATION AND DENSITY OF ISLINGTON. Before more fully discussing these matters it will be well to consider first some particulars as to the area of the district and the density and distribution of its population. Area. — The boundary line of Islington encloses 3,109 acres, of wliich 13.2 is water, mainly the Regent's Canal and New River Company's aqueduct. A very considerable portion is also devoted to the broad lines of the Great Northern and the North London Railways, while also a large area is occupied by the Cattle Market, the Highbury Fields and some smaller open spaces. The railways cover some 158½ acres, the Cattle Market 15½ acres, Highbury Fields 25 acres, and the smaller open spaces 12½ acres. Thus altogether about 224½ acres must be deducted from the total acreage to arrive at that available for living purposes. In the sub.districts the acreage of each is as follows:— Gross Area, Acres. Water, Acres. Railways, Acres. Market, Acres.. Parks and open Spaces, Acres. Net Area, Acres. Upper Holloway 1,028 — 21½ —. —. 1,006½ South.west Islington 813 4.1 55 16½ 7 731½ South.east „ 463 6.7 — . — . 3½ 452½ Highbury 806 2.4 82 — 27 693½ Islington 8,109 13.2 158½ 15½ 37½ 2,884½ 1898] 10 Here then we see that Upper Holloway has an available acreage of 1,006½, South.west Islington of 731½, South.east Islington of 452½ and Highbury of 693¾. Table I. Showing the Areas, Densities, and Estimated Populations of the Sub.registration Districts. Sub.Districts. Areas in Acres. Persons to an Acre. Acres to a Person. Estimated Number of Persons living at the middle of,1898. Upper Holloway 1,028 99 0.0100 102,034 Islington, South.west. 813 133 0.0075 108,211 Islington, South.cast 463 146 0.0068 67,667 Highbury 805 83 0.0119 67,096 Islington 3,109 111 0.0090 345,008 Density.—In this table it is seen that the number of persons living on each acre of Islington is 111, and that they average from 146 per acre in South.west Islington to 83 in Highbury. The parish is, therefore, very densely populated, even more so than these figures indicate because allowance must be made for the Railways, the Cattle Market and Highbury Fields. When this has been done, it is found that the densities of the Sub.districts and the District are as follows :— Upper Holloway 101 persons to an acre. South.west Islington 148 ,, „ South.east ,, 150 „ „ Highbury 97 „ ,, Islington 120 „ „ Such densities as these, although not unknown in London, are hardly ever found in provincial towns. This is well seen in Table V. where it will be noticed that the densities range from 8.6 persons per acre in Huddersfield to 60.9 in West Ham itself—except in name only—an integral part of the Metropolis. 11 [1898 The density of a population is to a large extent a factor in the mortality, which may be favourable or unfavourable; as it is small or great. It is not, however, a rule, as was once supposed, that the death. rate of a community was in proportion to its density. It will be noticed, however, in Table V., that the highest death.rates are for the most part found in the most thickly peopled places, a statement which is equally true of the provincial towns and of the Metropolitan Districts (vide Table VI.) Under these circumstances it is most gratifying to notice that, notwithstanding its great density of population, this Islington of ours shows such a remarkably low mortality. It is a noticeable fact that the density, 79 persons per acre, of the least dense portion of our district, namely, Tufnell Ward, is greater than that of the most densely populated of the large towns, and that our most thickly populated ward is nearly five times as dense as Manchester or Liverpool.

This is, indeed, the case, and consequently, as has been frequently pointed out, it is all the more necessary that in the future, as in the more recent past, its sanitary condition, especially of its houses, should be very carefully and anxiously looke 1 after; for it will be more by the crowding of the people in the existing houses than by building operations, that greater numbers will find accommodation. This will be met, doubtless, also by the pulling down of old properties and the erection on their sites either of large industrial dwellings for the working classes or by flats for the commercial classes or the more well to do people. In this connection it would be well not to forget that at the 1891 census 72,652 families or separate occupiers were lodged in 37,875 houses, making nearly two families per house. But matters were worse than this, and they certainly are no better now, for at that period, 1891— 28,189 persons lived in 1.roomed tenements or 8.8 per cent. of the population 60,639 „ ,, 2 ,, ,, ,, 19.0 „ „ 49,762 „ „ 3 „ „ „ 15.6 „ „ 41,740 „ „ 4 „ „ „ 13.1 „ Also that there were 12,856 tenements of 1 room. 16,716 „ „ 2 rooms. 11,806 „ „ 3 „ 8,015 „ „ 4 „ From these figures it is at once apparent that— 2.2 persons lived on the average in each 1.roomed tenement. 3.6 ,, ,, ,, ,, 2 „ ,, 4.2 „ ,, „ ,, „ 3 ,, „ 5.2 „ ,, ,, „ ,, 4 ,, „ At the first glance it does not appear that these tenements are over.crowded, nor indeed do the figures indicate that, they are. It is only when the census tables are further dipped into that this is discovered. 13 [1898 First, as regards sinqle.roomed tenements. It is stated that— 4,559 are occupied by 1 person. 4,240 „ 2 persons. 2,137 3 „ 1,194 „ 4 „ 497 „ ... ... 5 „ 159 „ 6 „ 51 „ 7 „ 10 „ 8 „ 4 „ 9 „ 4 „ 10 „ 1 „ 11 „ A single.roomed tenement should allow not less than 400 cubic feet air space for each occupier, irrespective of furniture, because it is at once the living, cooking and sleeping.room, hence its air becomes quickly polluted, and is not capable of supplying the occupiers with the amount of oxygen requisite for their well.being; wherefore it is most inadvisable that more than two persons should occupy such a room. If this be so, it then appears that at least 4,055 tenements, containing 15,300 persons, are over.crowded, or, in other words, that their occupants live under conditions that are dangerous to their health. Two.roomed Tenements.—The average number of persons living in two.roomed tenements is, as we have seen, 3.6 per tenement. In these rooms it is customary for the people for the greater part to use one room solely for living in during the day and the second room for sleeping in at night. Hence this overcrowding may be said to commence when they are occupied by more than three persons, so that they will be found to be in almost as bad a state as the single room tenements. Altogether there are 60,639 persons residing in such dwellings, of whom 20,455 live in rooms that are not occupied by more than three persons, thus leaving 40,184 who are living under conditions that are unsatisfactory. Three.roomed Tenements.—The average number of persons in each tenement is 4.2. In these rooms it is also the rule to give up one room for living in, so that overcrowding may be reckoned not to have 1898] 14 commenced until the two rooms available for sleeping are occupied by more than six persons. Altogether they number 11,806, and are dwelt in by 49,762 persons, of whom 36,020 are properly housed, and 13,742 are over.crowded. Four.roomed Tenements.—The average number of persons in occupation per tenement is 5.2. By applying the same rule as regards the living room to these dwellings, it is found that overcrowding does not commence until the occupants exceed nine persons. There are altogether 41,740 people in occupation, of whom 38,160 live in rooms not occupied by more than nine persons, so that there are 3,580 persons who live under unwholesome conditions. These particulars may be better grasped if placed in the form of a table. Number of tenements and of persons living in them. No. of Occupants in eash Tenement. One Boom. Two Rooms. Three Rooms.

It may be thought that the limit at which the 15 [1898 rooms begin to be overcrowded has been placed at too low a point. Perhaps, if the matter be considered for a moment, it will not appear so. It must be recollected that the houses in which this overcrowding exists are, for the most part, occupied by several families, who use a common staircase, whose sanitary accommodation is identical, and who draw their water from a common source, not being supplied with it individually. These circumstances lead to uncleanly habits. The staircases are neglected and therefore dirty, pails or other vessels are often used in the rooms, and washing becomes a luxury, because a premium is put on uncleanliness, in consequence of the enormous labour involved in dragging water. upstairs. Would that the law compelled a separate supply direct from the main on each flat in all such dwellings ! The buildings themselves, too, are not cared for as they should be by the leaseholders, so that there are found dilapidations, such as broken flooring boards, and broken walls (with receptacles for dirt and filth), dirty ceilings, walls thick with layers of paper (often half.a. dozen), windows that will not open, doors that will not close, yards whose surfaces are but sodden filth, frequently mixed with the excreta of fowls (which should never be tolerated near such dwellings), together with many other defects, which tend to make them more or less insanitary, and, therefore, not capable of affording those aids to health which are found in newer and better dwellings, occupied by individual families. These remarks are not of course intended to apply to all tenemented properties, for there are many in a most creditable state, but the fact is that a house which is let in lodgings or is occupied by the members of more than one family is, ipso facto, not so healthy as one not so occupied, even though other conditions be equal. According to the table 4,057 tenements with one room, 7,670 with two rooms, 1,752 with three rooms, and 331 with four rooms are overcrowded; altogether 13,810 tenements out of 49,393. These contain 15,150 overcrowded persons in tenements of one room, 40,184 in those of two rooms, 13,742 in those of three rooms, and 3,580 in those of four room's, or, altogether, 72,656 people. . Every gallon of water weighs 10 lbs., and as at least 5 gallons per head of family is required daily for drinking, cooking and domestic purposes, it can be seen that great labour is involved in bringing it upstairs. 1898] 16 Even if the most liberal allowance be made on the ground that these figures are too arbitrary there must still remain an enormous population who live under conditions that require careful supervision, and which should be from time to time carefully inspected, if we would not have Islington in the course of a few years become, what it certainly is not at present, a slum district of the Metropolis. We can see for ourselves what has occurred, and is still occurring, in some of the neighbouring districts, once the abode of the well.to.do, and even of the wealthy, aad we can see its effects on their mortality returns which are proportionally far higher than those of Islington. Assuredly if great care be not taken, and if stringent precautions be not adopted, the same fate will overtake us. We are not sufficiently alive to what is going on. At the present time there is a room hunger in this district which is almost alarming; to satisfy which many agents, owners and leaseholders are converting houses, which have hitherto been occupied by single families, into tenement dwellings for the artizans or for those who follow a commercial life in the City (particularly) or elsewhere in London. Numerous instances have recently come under the notice of the Public Health Department where work has had to be postponed for weeks because the unfortunate tenants could not find lodgings for themselves and their families. It has frequently been impossible to take up drains passing under the rooms which they occupied, and equally impossible to force the landlord to proceed with the work, because it meant casting the occupiers on the streets. If, under these circumstances, a man possesses a large family his case is almost hopeless, for his chance of obtaining apartments is almost nil, unless he resort to deceit to secure them. Just recently a complaint reached the Public Health Department from an owner of a house that a man had taken rooms from him for a family of three, and that now it numbered seven, because the additional members had been smuggled into them one by one, while one was a newly.born infant. The overcrowding of the people, no doubt, affects other metropolitan districts besides Islington, although it does not affect all equally alike. Here it is of more 17 [1898 importance than usual, as there is so little room for further expansion because of the lack of building sites. What, then, is the remedy? Broadly stated it is to discourage the transformation of existing houses, at present let to one person, into flats or into dwellings to be occupied by members of more than one family. This can be done by the Vestry itself to an extent, but increased legal powers will also be required. It is said that the person who makes two blades of grass grow where but a single blade flourished previously is a benefactor of mankind ; and in this light many property.owners, who plant 20 or more persons on a site whereon half.a.dozen people once dwelt, view themselves. But theirs is an altogether mistaken notion, for their action injures rather than benefits the body politic; for it is almost an axiom that the greater the crowding the greater the sickness and the higher the death.rate. And yet the authorities in London, as a rule, encourage the construction of these buildings by granting to their owners the privilege of a large percentage off their rates when they compound for them; that is to say they are allowed from 15 to 30 per cent, off the rates on the understanding that the amount be paid, whether the tenements be occupied or unoccupied. By so doing—in Islington, at all events —this Vestry must be a distinct loser, for it is an almost unknown circumstance for a property.owner to have an unlet set of apartments on his hands. The parish is full, and to overflowing. There is no need, therefore, to give him a helping hand and encouragement to still further increase the overcrowding in this district and thereby to jeopardise its health. The second remedy, or set of remedies, may require statutory powers. It is apparent to every person who takes a disinterested and impartial view of the subject that the conditions under which families, dwelling in houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family live, are far from satisfactory, either when viewed from the standpoint of sanitation, or of reasonable comfort or privacy. This is especially the case when the landlord does not live on the premises, for then no one is responsible for the cleanliness of the premises. The sanitary conditions are generally very indifferent, for the provision of a single w.c. is the rule rather than the exception, while invariably there is but a single.water supply for the whole house. 1898] 18 Wash.houses, in the accepted term of the word, there are none, means for coal storage there are none, while pantry accommodation is an almost unknown quantity—a luxury. But as these are all reasonable requirements it seems only the barest justice that the person who transforms residences, hitherto occupied by only one family, into houses to be tenanted by many people, (thereby deteriorating the properties themselves, as well as those in their neighbourhood, and reducing their rateable value, which, of course, means a loss of revenue to the Local Authority) should be compelled to make the effects of the increased aggregation of people as little felt as possible. He should, therefore, be required, before allowing these houses to be let to different families, (a) to make ample and suitable w.c. provision for the number of persons who are to occupy them ; (6) to supply each tenement with a separate water supply ; (c) to provide separate storage for coals ; (d) to provide sufficient means for washing clothes; and (e) to provide pantry accommodation for the keeping of food. These are absolute necessaries for civilized beings, and, therefore, should be provided in every tenement. Their presence tends to promote health ; their absence makes for dirt, ill.health, disease and death, while it also tends to dehumanize people and to breed paupers and criminals. But it may be argued that the owners of these houses are put to an increased cost in collecting their rents, because it is more expensive to collect from many tenants than from one. The answer to this is that, as a rule, they let their houses in this fashion for their own private gain, and that, while they have no more ground rent to pay, the rents received by them are very largely increased, while their rates, instead of being raised in proportion to their improved rents, are reduced on the plea that the properties are not so valuable. It seems to the writer that the duty of the people of Islington to.day is to protect themselves from being invaded by swarms of people from other parts of London, for this means the preservation of the good health of the Parish, which has from time immemorial been noted for 19 [1898 its salubrity, and to keep Islington for the Islingtonians. To do this will necessitate the adoption of the .most stringent precautionary measures, for assuredly, if they are neglected, a day of reckoning will fall on this Islington of ours, and that speedily, and then a long farewell to its good health and its low mortality. Population.—This was estimated to be 345,008 at the middle of the year, and is an increase of a little over 1 per cent. (1.1) on the population of 1897.

BIRTHS. There were 9,453 births registered during the year. This is the smallest return since 1890, when 9,419 children were born, which, however, bore a higher proportion to the population than the present number, for whereas the birth.rate was then 29.7 per 1,000 inhabitants, it is now only 27.39. The latter figure is probably, nay, it is, the low water mark in Islington, for never before was so low a birth.rate recorded Table VIII.

There were 5,705 persons died during the year, 2,898 being males and 2,807 females, as against a corrected annual average of 6,176 during the preceding thirteen years, but 310 more than the number registered in 1897. The death-rate was 16.5 per 1000 of the population compared with an average of during 17.90 the years 1885-97. It was, however; higher than the rate (15.8) experienced in the preceding year, which was the lowest on record. There is every reason to be satisfied with the present returns, so far as gross numbers are concerned, for they represent a death-rate which contrasts most favourably with the rates experienced in other places. Thus it was below the death-rate of England and Wales, and considerably less than that of London or the Great Towns. Indeed, only five of the last mentioned places were in a more healthy state, namely, Croydon, Cardiff, West Ham, Portsmouth and Brighton, while in London only seven districts showed better returns, namely Hampstead, St. George, Hanover Square, Stoke Newington, Wandsworth, Lee, Lewisham, Plumstead, Hackney, Camberwell, Paddington, all of which are not nearly so densely populated as Islington. The Islington deathrate was also below the mean rate (17.2) of the 07 other large towns. • In Glasgow the death-rate was 21.2 per 1000, in Edinburgh 19.7, and in Dublin 26 8. The two succeeding tables, which with the aid of the foot notes will explain themselves, are of great interest as showing the relative mortality in the Great Towns and in the London Districts. They show very conclusively the very good position in which the mortality of this district stands when brought into contrast with that of other places. It might be well in studying these tables to take into consideration the facts as to density of population already given in Tables V. and VI. 30 1898] Table XIII.

Upper Holloway. There were 1,530 deaths registered, equal to annual death-rate of only l5.O per 1,000, which is 3.17 below the average rate of the preceding seven years, and is only very slightly above the rate (14.75) experienced in 1897. It is a noteworthy fact about this district that ever since 1892 the death-rate, which was then 23.39 per 1,000, has steadily declined until it has fallen in the last two years to 14.75 and 1500. This is very satisfactory, and shows that the sanitary work which has been done in it has not been without its effect. South West Islington. The number of deaths was 2,050, as against an annual corrected average of 2,030, and the death-rate was 18.94, compared with a mean rate of 18.76 which obtained during the years 1891-7. South East Islington. 1,194 deaths were registered, representing a death-rate of 17.64, and are 34 below the corrected average of the preceding seven years, during which period the death-rate averaged 18.15 per 1,000. Highbury. The mortality returns were particularly good the deaths numbering 931, or 76 below the corrected mean of the preceding seven years, and the death-rate being 13.87 as against a mean rate of 15 01. In the Western portion of the sub-district (he death-rate was 14.20, and in the Eastern only 13.44 per 1,000. The annexed statement shows how the sub-districts contrasted with towns whose populations are as nearly as possible the same as their own. In every instance these towns are far less densely populated than the sub-districts. 33 Table XV, Upper Holloway. South-west Islington. Sonth-east Islington and Highbury. Towns. Deathrates. Towns.

SEASONAL MORTALITY. The deaths registered and the resulting death-rates therefrom during the four quarters of the year were as follows :— Deaths. Per 1,000 inhabitants. 1st Quarter 1,744 20'21 2nd „ 1,246 14.44 3rd „ 1,439 16.68 4th „ 1,276 14.79 First Quarter.—The deaths, which numbered 1,744, were 56 below the corrected average of the first quarters of the preceding thirteen yearly and the death-rate, which was 20.21 per 1,000, was 2.33 below the mean rate of the same period. During this quarter Measles and Whooping Cough were unusually fatal. c. 1898] 36 Second Quarter.—During this period the health of Islington, as judged by its mortality returns, was very satisfactory. Indeed, it might be almost described as abnormal, for the deaths, which numbered 1,246, were 172 below the corrected average of the second quarters of the years 1885-97, and the death-rate, which equalled 14.44 per 1,000 of the population annually, was 3.30 below the mean of the same periods. On one occasion only has the death-rate for this period been so low, namely in 1897, when it was only 12.67. If it had not been for the presence of Measles, which caused 107 deaths, the return would have been even more favourable than it was. Third Quarter.—The quarter was only slightly less healthy than is usual at this season of the year, the deaths being 41 above the corrected average of the third quarters of the preceding thirteen years and the death-rate 0.47 above the mean of the same periods. The total number of deaths was 1,439, as against a corrected average of 1,398; while the death-rate was 16.68 contrasted with a mean rate 16.21 per 1,000. In the beginning of this quarter very low death-rates were experienced, ranging from 9.98 1o 15.72 per 1,000. In its seventh week (the 33rd of the year) the mortality increased, so that the deathrate became 19.80, whence to the end of the quarter it varied from 17.53 to 21.76. Diarrhcea was the cause of this disturbance of the death-rate for it was more than usually prevalent, having caused 238 deaths, equal to an annual death-rate of 2.76, as against a corrected average of 165 in the corresponding periods of the thirteen years 1885.97. There have been occasions when the deaths exceeded this return, namely, in 1886 and 1887, when they were respectively 272 and 280. They are, however, the highest for ten years. Throughout the Country the 37 [1898 disease was above the average of the preceding ten years, as the following death-rates show:— Average 10 years. 1898. Increase. England and Wales. 1.7 2.85 1.15 33 Great Towns 2 .5 3.85 1.35 67 other Large Towns 2.0 3.27 1.27 Rural England and Wales 1.0 2.07 1.7 Islington 1.5 2.76 1.26 There cannot be any doubt that the increased mortality was chiefly due to the fact that the mean temperature which prevailed was 2.9° above that of the preceding ten years, and 30° above that of the preceding thirty years. Not indeed since 1884 (when the figures were the same as those recorded in the past quarter) has there been so high a temperature, nor so great a departure from the mean. When a comparison is made between the temperatures which prevailed and the deaths which occurred twelve months previously and those now recorded the effect of heat is well seen. Thus during the first four weeks of the quarter the mean weekly temperatures were considerably below those which prevailed in 1897, and the deaths were correspondingly less ; indeed they showed the large decrease of 22. In the next two weeks similar conditions obtained, but in the following week (the 7th of the quarter), the temperature suddenly rose so that its mean for the week was 7.5° above that of 1897. To this greatly increased temperature the diarrhoea sickness at once responded, as was clearly shown by an increased mortality of 17 in the following week. From this period to the end of the last week but one of the quarter the temperatures were much above those of the corresponding periods of 1897, and on one occasion the heat was as much as 16.2° and on another 11.8° in excess of that then registered. The result of this was that the deaths during September numbered 154 compared with 17 in 1897. c 2 38 1898] Table XX.

This year, owing to the fact that there wag more rain in the earlier weeks than in the corresponding periods of 1897, the earth did not get warm so quickly, and the mortality was held in check; but when these conditions were reversed in the later part of the quarter, its greater dryness and greater warmth quickly promoted a markedly increased mortality. The chief factors in the causation of Diarrhcea have been laid down in an opxis memorabil'e by Islington's first Medical Officers of Health, Dr. Edward Ballard, to be (1) temperature of the earth at 4 ft. deep above 56° Fab.; (2) high atmospheric temperature; (3) a loose soil permeable more or less freely by water and by air; (4) organic matter in the soil; (5) moisture or dryness of the soil; (6) density of population ; (7) density of buildings upon area ; (8) restriction of and impediments to the free circulation of air, either (a.) about dwellings or (b) within dwellings; (9) domestic darkness and general dirtiness of 39 1898 dwellings; (10) sewer or cesspool emanations; (11) atmospheric fouling, from mere coal smoke or from the gaseous emanations of chemical works or of chemical refuse ; (12) filthy accumulations of domestic refuse in privies, ash-pits, dust-bins, &c.; (13) undefined pollutions of drinking water; (14) social position; (15) food (a), mode of feeding, as that of feeding young infants by means of bottles, and (6) food keeping, eg., the exposure of food to contamination by telluric emanations or to emanations from accumulations of domestic filth; (16) maternal neglect and carelessness in infant management; (17) occupation of females from home. From this brief recapitulation it is seen at once that many conditions which lead to the large annual mortality are entirely preventable, and can be dealt with, some by sanitary authorities and others by the heads of households, especially by the women thereof. Among the former, might be pointed out as one of first importance, the necessity of paving the entire surface of yards (in so many instances by a misnomer called "gardens" by their owners, particularly when attached to tenemented houses) because the frequent pollution of the earth, either by children, animals, or the drainings of dirty water from clothing, render them particularly liable to promote Diarrhcea, either through the inhalation of the foul dust which so quickly forms in hot or even dry weather, the contamination of the air itself, or the contamination of the food by the dust or by the fouled air. It might be added that the paving of these yards is just as necessary for the prevention of Enteric Fever and Diphtheria. It has frequently been remarked that Islington has generally showed a better record for Diarrhoea than most places, and this has been ascribed to the facts that the houses here have more air space about them, and are not so crowded together as in other places. But we must not forget, because these conditions exist, to enforce those others which are of paramount importance; one of which was formerly, and to an extent even now is, lost sight of, namely, the concreting of the ground on which the houses stand. Dr. Ballard has shown that the Diarrhceal mortality in dwelling houses built on solid rock is, notwithstanding other unfavourable conditions, low, and, indeed, almost altogether unnoticeable. The reason is not far to seek, namely, that such houses are not influenced by the movements of the ground air, which, it is now recognized, is most necessary to exclude from dwelling houses.

MEASLES. Measles was unusually prevalent and fatal, for it caused 325 deaths or 136 more than the average of the recorded deaths during the preceding thirteen years. They were also 121 more than the average of the same period after correction had been made for the largely increased population. The 325 deaths were equal to a death-rate of 0.94 per 1,000 of the population, a rate which was more than a third of the death-rate from the principal zymotic diseases taken collectively. In one year only since 1885 were so many deaths registered from Measles, namely in 1887 when 335 were entered. The epidemic really commenced in the fourth quarter of 1897, when 72 deaths occurred. These were followed by 183 deaths in the first quarter of 1898, by 107 in the second and by 23 and 12 in the third and fourth quarters respectively. The history of the epidemic was given in the return for the second quarter of the year, and it is now reprinted here. 55 [1898 "The disease was first noticed in the neighbourhood of Richard and Trinity Streets towards the end of October under circumstances which have been fully explained in my last annual report, pages 98 et seq., and, therefore, it will be unnecessary to go into details now, particularly as the conduct of the School Board, therein detailed, is not likely to be repeated. "Almost immediately afterwards I received information of its appearance in the neighbourhood of Hornsey Road and Poole's Park, and inquiries led to the closing of the Infants' Department of St. Anne's Church School and of Upper Hornsey Road and Poole's Park Board Schools. At this time the disease also became prevalent in that portion of the district which is bounded on the— North-west by St. John's Road. South-east by Fairbridge Road. South-west by Ashbrook Road. North-east by Mulkern Road. ''From this centre of infection it seems to have travelled down Hornsey Road, until the area around the Forster Board School, situated on that road, became infected towards the end of January, at which time many of the scholars were attacked, and it became necessary to close the School. "On the 11th of February the Infants' Department of St. Mark's Church School, Grove Road, was closed because of the prevalence of the disease among the infants, of whom 70, or more than a fourth, were absent by reason of its presence in their homes. " In February the disease was prevalent in the north-west of the district, and particularly so in the neighbourhood of the Yerbury Road Board School, whose infant classes were closed at a moment when no fewer than 154 scholars out of 514 on the rolls were excluded because either they were ill themselves or because their homes were infected. " Within three days of this School being closed the disease was found to be fatally prevalent in the neighbourhood of Dorset Street, and consequently, the Infants' Department of the St. Paul's Church Schools was closed on February 23rd, at which time 74 children out of 204 were away from School. 56 1898] "Two days later (25th February) it became necessary to close the Infants' Class Rooms of the Station Road Board School, as it was found that 72 out of 292 scholars were absent through illness, while 18 were not in attendance because of illness in their homes. "On the same date the Caledonian Road Board School was ascertained to be considerably infected, and therefore its Infants' Department was closed. At this time 73 scholars were away ill, while 12 were absent because Measles was in their houses. "Three days later (February 28th) it became necessary to close the Infant Classes of the St. Mary Magdalene (Chapel-of-Ease) Church Schools, from which 52 children out of 268 were absent. "The St. Mary Church Schools were closed on March 3rd, at which time 205 out of 720 scholars on the rolls were absent. Of the 205 scholars 145 were themselves ill, while 60 were detained at home on account of the disease being present in the houses in which they resided. "On the same day (March 3rd) the Infants' Department of St. Clement's Schools was closed, because out of 184 on the school register 87 children were absent through being ill with Measles. "Three days later a very serious report reached me as to the state of affairs at the Infants' Department of the Ecclesbourne Road Board Schools, and on inquiries being made it was discovered that out of 642 children on the roll 230 were absent through Measles in their homes, of which number 130 were themselves ill. Consequently, this department of the School was closed on March 8th. • "The day prior (March 7th) to this date Westbourne Road Board School (Infants' Department) was closed because it was found that out of 495 scholars 134 were absent, of whom 80 were ill and 54 lived in infected homes. ''Canonbury Road Board School was the next School to be closed (March 28). At this date 79 children out of 393 on the rolls were absent, either because they were ill themselves or lived in houses where other children were ill with Measles. 57 [1898 "On March 31st the disease Lad become so prevalent among the infant scholars of Duncombe Road Board School that their class rooms were closed. At this date there were 652 infants on the class rolls, of whom 92 were away ill, while 31 were living in infected homes. "Just about this time the Easter Holidays intervened and consequently all Schools remained closed until April 18th, at which time the weekly return of deaths from Measles had sunk to 11. ''About April 22nd it came to my knowledge that 180 infants out of 437 who usually attended Vittoria Place Board Schools were absent because of Measles. On inquiry it was found that 80 were ill, and 100 had the disease in their homes. Table XXXIII.

Separate they indicate the numbers who were absent through the combined causes. 68 1898] "Altogether 7,193 infant scholars attended the Schools which were closed, and of these 2,035 were either laid up with Measles or lived in infected houses at the time of the closure of the Infants' Departments of the several Schools. These represent 28.3 per cent, of the scholars in actual attendance. "It cannot he said that this percentage was too low to warrant the closing of the classes. On the contrary, I am of opinion that the reverse was the case, and that, judging the results of the closure of the Schools by the amount of disease among the scholars at their re-opening, it would have been better to have closed them when 10.0 per cent. of the scholars had become absentees because of Measles. I might here mention, that in nearly every instance inquiries were made a few days before the Schools were re-opened, to ascertain how many children and houses remained infected, and on each occasion it was found that the disease was practically non-existent. "Surely these facts are sufficient warrant for the closing of the Schools, and for their early closing if possible. Unfortunately in most cases I was unable to carry out my desires, because I had not daily information from the Head Teachers of the Infant Schools; indeed, it was only when there was an unusual number of children absent, or when I made inquiries, that they suddenly awoke to the necessity of notifying the absentees to me. I think they more thoroughly understand the importance of this matter now, and that the future will show that cases of Measles will be more readily notified by them than has been their custom. "It will also be noticed from the table just given that the longest period for which a School was closed was 35 days,* while the longest period for which the Sanitary Authority ordered Schools to be closed was 28 days, the usual period being 21 days. "In the case of Richard Street School the time during which the School was first required to be kept closed was three weeks, but on * Due to the inclusion of the Christmas Holidays. 59 [1898 inquiries being made it was found that the homes of the children were still considerably infected, and, therefore, the Sanitary Authority desired that they should not be re-opened for a further period of seven days. " In the case of Pooles' Park and Hornsey Road Board Schools the period for which they were intended to be closed was really three weeks, but inasmuch as the Christinas Holidays would commence on December 18th, the School Authorities very wisely refrained from re opening them until the vacation had ceased on January 10th. "As regards the mortality from the disease, I have already stated that there were 365 deaths,* which represent an annual death-rate of 1.41 per 1,000 of the population, a figure which may not look very high to those who do not recollect that the disease attacked very few persons who were over five years of age ; indeed, there were only 20 over this age who died. "The sub-districts return show that the deaths in each quarter since the epidemic began were as follows:- Table XXXIV. 1897. 1893. Totals. 4th quarter. 1st quarter. 2nd quarter. Upper Holloway 37 49 27 123 South-west Islington 21 82 47 150 South-east ,, 4 32 15 51 Highbury 10 20 8 38 Total 72 183 107 362 As this table does not show the incidence with regard to population, I have arranged the following table which gives the number of deaths per 100,000 of the population in each district. I have done this in order to avoid the use of decimals, which would be necessary in taking smaller proportions. * In July, 6 additional deaths occurred. 60 1893] Table XXXV.

In the South-east it was 100, and in Upper Holloway 161. In the last mentioned district the disease followed a very even course throughout the epidemic, for the deaths were 37, 49 and 37 respectively in each quarter, and the death-rates per 100,000 persons were 147, 192 and 145. How different this is from the very sudden rise and quick fall which occurred in Islington West; where the deaths for each quarter were respectively 21, 82 and 47, and the proportion to each 100,000 persons 78,303 and 147. Similarly in Islington South-east the disease fluctuated considerably, for while it only caused four deaths in the fourth quarter of 1897, yet it increased eight-fold in the 1st quarter of this year, the deaths being 32, which decreased to 15 in the 2nd quarter. In these periods the death-rates per 100,000 of the population were 23, 189 and .89 respectively. "In Highbury, also, there was a quick rise and a sharp fall in the deaths, which, although they were only 10 in the closing quarter of the year, increased almost 100 per cent. in the 1st quarter, numbering 20: and fell to 8 in the 2nd quarter. During these periods the rates were respectively 60, 119 and 48 per 100,000 inhabitants in the three quarters. 61 [1898 "In the Parish, as a whole, there were 72 deaths in the 4th quarter of last year. 183 in the 1st quarter, and 107 in the 2nd quarter of this year, while the rates per 100,000 were respectively 84, 212 and 124, and for the entire nine months 140."

This is just what might have been expected, fur whereas the first is a very crowded district with 102 persons living on each acre, the latter has only 83 persons. On consulting Table II. it will be noticed that Lower Holloway is not the most densely populated Ward, but this is accounted for by the fact that no allowance has been made for the large spaces occupied by Cattle Market, the Great Northern and the North London Railways, which of course cause very great concentration of population on the remainder of the district. It is noteworthy, too, that Upper Holloway Ward, considering that the disease was very fatal in the adjoining Tollington Ward (especially in its more southerly parts), escaped with a comparatively light mortality. St. Mary's and St. Peter's Wards were also relatively free from the disease as judged by the number of deaths, which is the more remarkble in that they are both densely inhabited ; indeed, St. Peter's, which is the most densely populated Ward in Islington, houses 204 persons on each of its acres, or nearly twice the average density of the whole Parish, which is 111. The density of St. Mary's is 120 persons per acre. Generally speaking, I do not find in this epidemic that the mortality in the Wards has been always in proportion to the density of the population, but it suggests a connection as may be seen in the following figures:— Wards. Persons to an Acre. Deaths per 100.000 Inhabitants. Tufnell 79 123 East Highbury 83 46 West Highbury 83 99 Tollington 97 291 Lower Holloway 102 240 Canonbury 110 134 Wards. Persons toan Acre. Deaths per 100,000 Inhabitants, St Mary's 120 87 Upper Holloway 129 92 Barnsbury 165 143 Thornhill 195 171 St. Peters 204 76 "When the last epidemic of Measles took place in 1895-6 the deaths were not taken out for the Wards, and I am therefore unable to make any comparisons between the mortality of that date and the present 63 [1898 time. They were, however, tabulated for the geveral sub-districts, and hence, I can now show their relative mortalities. Sub-Districts. Death rates per 100.000 inhabitants. Persons to an acre. 1895-6 1897-8 Upper Holloway 60 161 99 Highbury 63 76 83 South-east Islington 95 100 146 South-west „ 169 185 133 Total 102 140 111 "Here we perceive that Upper Holloway sub-registration district (not ward) had the least mortality in the epidemic of 1895-6, whereas now it stands third. Highbury, which then stood in the second place, now stands first, while South-east Islington has risen from third place to second. South-west Islington occupies the lowest place in each epidemic. This changing of the incidence of the disease may most probably be attributed to the fact that the preceding epidemic had to an extent drawn on its stores so much that its pabulum was now soon exhausted. "This table is also of interest, because it shows that the present epidemic was more severe than that which preceded it in each district. Thus the rates per 100,000 inhabitants rose from 60 to 161 in Upper Holloway, from 169 to 185 in South-west Islington, from 95 to 100 in South-east Islington, and from 63 to 76 in Highbury. Now, although the returns for the Wards did not point to a certain connection between density and mortality, yet they certainly suggested it. In the case of the sub-registration districts, the case is altered, for there the district mortality, with one exception, bears a relationship to the density. In a previous table I have shown that the mortality of Islington West was 143, but when the Great Northern Railway cutting and the North London Railway embankments, and the Cattle Market, and the Grand Canal, are eliminated from it, it will be found to be the densest district in Islington, as any one can easily judge for himself by traversing the streets situated between Caledonian Road and York Road on the east and west, and the Cattle Market and King's Cross on the 64 1898] north and south. This being so the districts stand in the following relative positions:— Death rate per 100,000 Persons to an acre. Highbury 76 83 South-east Islington 100 146 Upper Holloway 61 99 South-west Islington 185 149 "From these figures it appears that practically density and deathrate went hand in hand, the only exception being that South-east Islington instead of occupying the third place occupies the second. "How severe the epidemic really was can be understood when I mention the number of children living at each year under five years, the number of deaths, and the proportion of deaths to each 1,000 living at these periods. Ages. Estimated Population. Deaths. Deaths per 1,000 children. under 1 year 8,783 69 7.85 1—2 7,942 143 18.00 2—3 8,319 73 8.77 3—4 8,114 38 4.68 4—5 7,659 27 3.53 under 5 years 40,817 350 8.57 "I would, however, point out that the proportion of deaths to each 1,000 living is not calculated as if they were annual death rates, but are the actual proportions to each 1,000 children living at each age period. "In this table the serious nature of the epidemic is well seen, for out of every 1,000 infants who had not reached 1 year of age nearly 8 died; out of every 1,000 children between 1 and 2 years old 18 died; out of every 1,000 between 2 and 3 years nearly 9 died; out of every 1,000 between 3 and 4 years nearly 5 died; and out of every 1,000 between 4 and 5 years nearly 5 died; and finally out of every 1,000 children under 5 years old, nearly 9 died. 65 [1898 "Surely after such a statement as this no person can pretend to think that Measles is so trifling a complaint that little or no care need be taken of the patient, And yet it is just this lack of care which kills, because it lays the patient open to secondary diseases, a fact which may be fully understood by an examination of the following table ;— Table XXXVIII. Showing the Secondary Causes of the deaths from Measles, during the Epidemic. Secondary Diseases. Males. Females. Totals.

In my report for the first quarter of this year I pointed out that many of these deaths were avoidable, and, consequently, I will not now discuss the question especially as I know that my remarks received very wide publicity in the medical and lay press, 66 1898] "I have not said anything about the number of cases of Measles which occurred in this outbreak, for I do not know it, but if I reckon the fatal cases as being 5 per cent, of the total, then there could not have been less than 7,300, which, I think, is a fair estimate. Allowing that 300 of these were over five years of age I find that 7,000 cases would represent, a proportion of 171 children attacked out of every 1,000 children under that age, and they are estimated to number 40,817. Even if the fatality had been 10 per cent. there would still have been 3,500 cases of the disease among children under five years old, or a proportion of nearly 86 to every 1,000. Whether I take the higher or the lesser fatality the number of attacks was very great, but of these, unfortunately, I received hardly any information, except such as came from a few Schools. "The epidemic practically came to a close during the second quarter, for only 23 deaths were registered in the third quarter and 12 in the fourth."

The return from this disease was probably the lowest on record for there were only 26 deaths known. In 1886, it is true that the record was exactly the same, but when the largely increased population is taken into account these 26 deaths were equivalent to 30 at the present time. The death-rate was only 0.07. It is noteworthy that no death was registered in South-west Islington in the fourth quarter, nor in South-east Islington in the second.

INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths among infant children, that is to say, children under twelve months old, were more numerous than usual. They numbered 1,504 and were in the proportion of 159 to every 1,000 infants born during the year. This infantile mortality rate is, with two exceptions, the highest known in the fifteen years 1883-97. Nevertheless, when an inquiry is made as to what has occurred in other places during the same period, the return appears much more favourable than it does at first sight. 85 [1898 The Registrar General in his Annual Summary for 1898 writes that "the infantile mortality, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to births registered was equal to 178 per 1,000 in the thirty-three great towns, and was 11 per 1,000 above the average proportion in the ten preceding years. During the year 1898 the lowest proportions in the thirty-three towns were 150 in Croydon, 153 in Huddersfield, 156 in Portsmouth, and 158 in Cardiff; the highest proportions were 206 in Blackburn, 208 in Gateshead, 212 in Salford and 225 in Preston." It may be accepted that although the local infantile mortality rate was 13 in the 1,000 births more than the usual average, yet in other places the excess over the average rate was also great and in some places excessive. Thus in Birmingham it was 11, in London 12, in Manchester 12, in Wolverhampton 12, in Salford 14, in Bradford 14, in Sheffield 15, in West Ham 16, in Norwich 17, in Derby 17, in Bristol 20, in Birkenhead 20, in Croydon 22, in Newcastle 23, in Swansea 27, in Sunderland 33, in Brighton 33, and in Gateshead 42, above the average of the preceding ten years. The cause of the excess rates was chiefly due to the large number of deaths from diarrhoea in the third quarter, and to some extent to measles, which was the case in at least six of the abovementioned towns. The Islington records for the preceding fifteen years have been as follows:— Years. Deaths under 1 year. Deaths per 1,000 Births. Years. Deaths under 1 year.

In the second quarter there was an excess of deaths from Measles (11), Whooping Cough (8) and Premature Birth (18). In the third quarter there was an increased mortality from Diarrhoea (90), Enteritis (39), Premature Birth (20), Bronchitis (6), Pneumonia (6) and Dentition (5). Finally, in the fourth quarter, there was an increased number of deaths from Diarrhoea (13), Enteritis (11) and Debility (6). These increases in the returns fully account for the increased mortality for the year. The mortality in the several quarters was as follows:— 1st quarter 362 deaths = 151 per 1,000 births. 2nd „ 282 „ = 122 ,, ,, 3rd „ 561 „ = 227 ,, ,, 4th „ 299 „ = 132 ,, ,, The year 1,504 „ = 159 ,, ,, 87 [1898 The infantile mortality rates in the several sub-districts were Deaths.

The notifications were highly satisfactory as they were, with the exception of the year when the system was first adopted, the lowest on record. 1808] 88 Indeed, the infectious eases, which numbered 2,418, were 1,000 less than the corrected average of the years 1891-7. These cases represented a case-rate of 7.01 per 1,000 inhabitants, which, as the following return shows, is 2.89 below the mean rate. Cases. 1891 2,063 = 6.4 per 1,000 inhabitants. 1892 3,320 = 10.3 „ ,, 1893 4,853 = 14.8 „ ,, 1894 3,123 = 9.4 ,, „ 1895 2,840 = 8.5 „ ,, 1896 3,822 = 11.3 „ ,, 1897 2,903 = 8.5 „ „ Corrected mean 3,418 = 9.90 ,, ,, 1898 2,418 = 701 In London the case-rate was 8.3, and in the Encircling Districts 9.1 per 1,000 of the population. The most gratifying feature of the return is that the reduction in the number of cases was general to all the diseases, with the exception of Enteric Fever, which showed the slight increase of 2. Thus, Small Pox cases were less by 49, Scarlet Fever by 470, Diphtheria by 280, Membranous Croup by 18, Erysipelas by 165, Puerperal Fever by 13, and Continued Fever by 5.

As in past years, so in 1898, careful inquiry was made in every instance as to the attendance at school of the children living in the homes wherein the disease occurred, and as to the schools attended by the patients if they were scholars. Altogether it was found that 891 patients were scholars attending one of the public elementary schools, a list of which will be found in Table LXXXVIII.. and that 614 children, who, not being in attendance at school themselves, lived in houses from which other children attended In addition to these cases many hundred cases of Measles came under notice, but as this matter was fully dealt with when writing of (his disease in the earlier part of the report it is not now proposed to dwell further on the subject. It might also be mentioned that, during the latter part of the year especially, the head teachers of the various Board Schools supplied the Medical Officer of Health with the names and addresses of numerous children who were absent from school by reason of Measles, Whooping Cough, Mumps and Skin Affections. BACTERIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS OF DIPHTHERIA, ENTERIC FEVER AND PHTHISIS. It became the duty of the Medical Officer of Health, in July, to bring under the notice of the Public Health Committee the possibility of diagnosing certain infectious diseases by Bacteriological Examination and also the advantages that would be likely to accrue from their early recognition. Previous to this time, the matter had been under consideration, but he only refrained from bringing it forward until he was in a position to form some opinion as to its utility and as to its cost.

He, therefore, recommended the Public Health Committee to have these examinations made, and they unanimously approved of his suggestion. Consequently he was enabled to issue a circular letter to the Medical Profession informing its members that an arrangement had been made with the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine to make the necessary examinations at half-a-crown per case, but free of charge to them. From that date to the end of the year 31 examinations were made for Diphtheria and 47 for Enteric Fever at a cost of £9 l5s. to the Vestry. The Medical Practitioners in Islington have been greatly gratified with the results obtained and have hailed the action of the Public Health Department with very great delight. On the 19th of December, the writer in the following report urged the Public Health Committee to go one step further and cause Bacteriological Examinations to be made for the diagnosis of Phthisis, free of charge to practitioners. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Sir, Madam and Gentlemen, BACTERIOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS. I am pleased to be able to report that the bacteriological examination for the diagnosis of Diphtheria, and the application of the Widal test for Enteric Fever, have been taken advantage of in 73 instances. The former has been made in 28 instances, and the latter in 45. The cost to the Vestry has been £9 2s. 6d., a very small expenditure when it is considered that it has settled the diagnosis of these cases. As an example of its great usefulness, I may mention, that only on Friday last I received a letter from Dr. S.-, who had under his care two doubtful cases of throat affection, thanking me for the information that they were Diphtheria. I think I might now urge on you to go one step farther to enable practitioners to diagnose another disease, which, although not one of the zymotic diseases, is of the tirst importance to recognize in its earliest stage, namely, Phthisis, for at this period it 108 1898 is amenable to treatment, mil therefore, may be cured. Whereas, if it he allowed to advance too far it is not so amenable, or indeed, it may have become incurable. The bacillux of Tuberculosis has long since been determined, and, therefore, no difficulty can arise in recognising it, either in the sputum or in the secretions from the throat. I am certain that, if you undertake this work, you will confer a great boon oil all persons who may be threatened with the disease. I do not think there is any need for me to enlarge on this subject, for I am certain that my proposal will appeal to every member of this Committee, whose anxiety has ever been to prevent the causes of death. What other authorities are doing I am not aware, but I think I am quite safe in saying that few, if any, have undertaken this work. That they will do so, and before long, I have not the least doubt, for the force of circumstances will compel them. Let us not await until then. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. E. HARRTS, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Upper Street, N., 19th December, 1898. The Committee without hesitation adopted the report and since then diagnoses have been made of many cases. There is no question but that the action of the Vestry has been very highly appreciated by all the practitioners in every part of this immense district, and, indeed, letters of thanks have been received by the Medical Officer for the speed with which the diagnosis has been made. FATALITY FROM THE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. The fatality from the infectious diseases was 7·6 per cent. of the total cases, 2,418 in number, of whom 183 died. The fatality rate from Scarlet Fever was only 1·9 per cent., as against 3·8 per cent. the preceding year. The fatality from Diphtheria remained practically what it was in 1898, the rate being 16·4, as compared with 16·9. The Puerperal Fever fatality rose from 35·7 in the preceding year to 36·8 109 1898 Table LXXXIX.

The disinfection of houses and clothing after the occurence of infectious disease showed a large decrease on the preceding years, a fact which is altogether accounted for by the decrease in the number of patients by 588 on those notified in 1897, and by 1,404 on those known in 1896. There was for a time a growing tendency for people to carry out their own disinfection, but as this was most undesirable in the public interest a certificate was drawn up which had to be signed by the medical attendant, who declared that he had satisfied himself that the disinfection of the clothing and the house had been properly carried out. Since then the practice has gradually ceased, so that it is expected it will soon be a thing of the past. The disinfection of clothing was very satisfactorily performed at the disinfecting station in the two steam disinfectors erected a few years since by Messrs. Goddard, Massey & Warner, of Nottingham. These machines continued to give the utmost satisfaction, and, with the exception of the cost of new rubbers on the doors, have required no money to be spent on them. In addition to the Vestry's own work, the disinfection of clothing for the Vestry of Stoke Newington is effected at a reasonable charge. For a few days during the year, while the disinfector at St. Pancras was undergoing repairs, permission was given to the Public Health Department of that Vestry to disinfect clothing at the Islington station. This privilege was all the more readily accorded because, before the present station had been erected, that Vestry had gladly performed similar work for this Parish. The total number of rooms disinfected during the year was 2,358, as against 2,701 in the preceding year ; and the total number of rooms stripped was 1,033, compared with 1,158 in 1897. Although notices were served, as required by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in every instance on the owners of property to I 2 134 1898] disinfect, cleanse and strip rooms in which infectious diseases bad occurred, yet very few have complied with them, and thus the onus of doing the work was thrown on the Vestry. At one time a considerable amount of stripping and cleansing was done by landlords, but gradually they have awakened to the fact that if they do not execute it the Vestry will be compelled under the provisions of the Act to do it. The following statement gives the particulars for last year, as well as for the preceding year, of the clothing, etc., disinfected at the Vestry's Disinfecting Station:— 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter.

This work, which was first begun to be performed in a systematic manner in June, 1895, was, as has been usual since that time, performed most excellently by Mr. Wroot the Superintendent, and the staff of the Dusting Department. For the information of those members of the Vestry who are not aware ol the good work now being effected, and by the Vestry's own 136 1898] staff too, a statement extending from 1891 to the present date is appended. It shows clearly that the houses of Islington, as regards the storage of refuse, so often of a noxious character, is very different to what it was prior to 1895, for whereas then not only the householders but the Sanitary Inspectors were constantly complaining of the state of affairs, now they are hardly ever heard. Indeed, most of the complaints, few as they are, that now reach the Public Health Department are to the effect that a removal of the dust is not made more than once a week. When one remembers the outcry that was made in 1895, about the upsetting of household arrangements that a weekly collection would involve, one's astonishment is all the greater that even a single request should be made for a more frequent removal. 1891 10,138 1892 9,964 1893 4,986 1894 4,506 1895 2,506 1896 245 1897 312 1898 303 The 303 applications to remove dust were only 0.672 per cent. of the 45,096 separate assessments in the district. The largest number of requests came from East Highbury Ward, where they represented 1.28 per cent. of the assessments, and the least from Tufnell where they were only 0.38 per cent. Particulars for each Ward are given in Table Z in the Appendix. WORKSHOPS. To the inspection of Workshops one Inspector, Miss Gray, devotes herself wholly, while another (Mr. George West) sets apart the greater portion of his time to similar work. They have been generally well received by the employers whose premises they have had to visit, although there have been a few who 137 [1898 resented their inspection as an intrusion, yet such persons have speedily seen the folly of their ways and have ultimately afforded every facility for the inspections. The following statement, which shows the sanitary work effected, does not by any means represent the amount of good which has been done, for many suggestions for the comfort of the employees made by the Inspectors have been adopted by the Masters. Workrooms— Inspected 3,284 Overcrowded 21 Badly ventilated 2 Dirty 109 Workshops— Newly discovered 259 Reported to H.M.

The former is full of interest, as showing the character of her work in workshops where women are employed. Her remarks respecting the conditions under which the outworkers labour are worthy of attention, while her conclusion that the advantages 138 1898] of working at home are outweighed by the disadvantages will be readily accepted because they are founded on an assured foundation. It will be noticed in Table XCIII. that no less than 10 infectious diseases occurred in dressmakers' homes, in addition to which fully 13 cases were known in homes where wearing apparel was made up for the great wholesale houses in the City. MISS OKAY'S REPORT. The Vestry Hall, Islington, N., 1st February, 1899. To A. E. Harris, Esq Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration a report of my work for the year 1898. Registers.— At the end of the year there were on the "Register of Workshops where Females are Employed" and on the "Laundry Register" a total of 1,026 workshops, containing 1,646 workrooms. In 379 of these workshops dress, mantle and blouse-making arc carried on; in 440 miscellaneous trades (details of which will be found in the table which I append to this report) are carried on, and there are 207 workshop laundries. 195 workshops and 27 laundries have been added to the Registers during the year, while 131 workshops and 17 laundries have been removed from them. Notifications have been sent to the Home Office of 130 workshops and laundries which had not been visited by H.M. Inspector of Factories. There are, approximately, 5,000 females employed in the registered workshops and 1,700 in the laundries. The numbers fluctuate with the busy seasons, which during the past year have been short, as the cold spring and warm autumn materially affected the demand for articles of wearing apparel, in the manufacture of which most of the workers are engaged. Inspections.— I have inspected in the course of the year 1,535 workshops and laundries, containing 2,427 workrooms, and I have made 1,514 re-inspections, and calls. These figures include inspections of the three public conveniences for women and of the homes of female outworkers. The general condition of the workrooms now compares very favourably with (hat existing in 1895, when I mads my first inspection, as a proof of which I may point out that practically no complaints were received from employees regarding insanitary conditions in workrooms during the year. Overcrowding.— I found 15 workrooms to be overcrowded on inspection. In these the overcrowding has been abated. 139 [1898 I have distributed 279 cards to be exhibited in workrooms, stating the cubic capacity of each room and the number of persons who may be employed in it. It is to be regretted that the Factory and Workshop Act requires no extra cubic space in laundry ironing rooms in which there are iron-heating stoves, as in some rooms, though the legal 250 cubic feet is allowed for each person, the workers have to stand too close to the stoves, which, particularly in summer, is most exhausting, and cannot but be prejudicial to the health of the workers, especially considering the long hours (14 per day) they may be called on to work. It is also a matter for regret that there is no fixed minimum height for ironing rooms, as occasionally over-head drying is carried on in rooms which are so low that the wet clothes hang close to the heads of the ironers, and the dampness and heat of the atmosphere are very great. Ventilation.— In two dressmakers' rooms, which were structurally insufficiently ventilated, additional ventilators have been provided. In summer the ventilation of the workrooms presents comparatively little difficulty, but in winter the tendency, on the part of the employees, to keep all windows and ventilators closed, still exists. Cleanliness.— 84 workrooms, found in a dirty condition, have been cleansed and whitewashed. Proportionately the largest number of these rooms was in laundries, where the presence of dirty linon, dirty water and soapsuds, combined with the steam and dust from coppers and stoves, make frequent whitewashing a necessity. The work, which in mos "workshop" laundries is carried on in dwelling-houses, and not in specially adapted premises, causes many dilapidations, and the exercise of great care and vigilance on the part of the occupier is necessary to keep a laundry in a thoroughly clean and sanitary condition. Sanitary Defects.— In addition to the above-mentioned nuisances, I have discovered on inspection and reported to you the existence of 262 sanitary defects liable to be dealt with under the Public Health Act. In consequence of my reports the drains of 19 workshops have been tested by Inspector West and relaid under his supervision. I have served 85 intimation notices regarding the various defects, and I have personally supervised the abatement of 184 nuisances. Comlaints referred to H.M. Inspectors of Factories.— I have forwarded to H.M. Women Inspectors of Factories for their consideration various complaints which have been made to me regarding excessive hours of work and illegal employment of women and children, and also as to insanitary conditions existing in work places in other districts. The Homes of Female Outworkers.— In visits to the homes of female outworkers, who work alone or assisted by members of their own family only, I have found work being done in very varied surroundings. In some cases the workers are fairly well-to-do women, who only want to earn a little pocket money, and who work in their sitting rooms or kitchens; but frequently the work is the only or principal means of livelihood, and is carried on in the family living and sleeping room. In one such instance I found Ladies' Costumes being machined in her "one" room by a woman, who, though a good worker, had had to leave her indoor place of work on account of her great want of personal cleanliness ! The outworkers have to work late and early during the seasons, although in their slack time they are frequently weeks without employment. As there is no possibility of 140 1898] united action among them the middleman is able to make his own bargain with each individual and the work is often done for the merest pittance, and all expenses of houseroom, lighting, heating, machines, cottons, &c., fall on the worker, who brings the work out from the shop and takes it back finished. The system is doubtless a convenience to the few, but on the whole it seems to me that the advantages are outweighod by the disadvantages, i.e., tho tendency to lower the price of women's labour all round, in many cases, the neglectcd condition of the homes, and the danger of the spread of disease by means of the articles which are made in such surroundings. I am glad to be able to report that I have met with very little opposition in the course of my work. The employers have, as a rule, received me in a friendly way and have shewn themselves ready to act on my suggestions for the improvement of their workplaces. Nature of Business. Number of workshops.

To A. E. Harris, Esq., Vestry Hall, Medical Officer of Health. " Upper Street, Islington, N., January, 1899. Dear Sir, I have much pleasure in again submitting to you a report of my work during the year 1898. I have paid 3,833 visits to factories, workshops and workrooms, in the Parish, viz.:— 1,749 inspections and 2,084 re-inspections. 133 notices have been served for the abatement of nuisances and 50 additional w.c's have been provided. 105 workshops and workrooms have been cleansed and whitewashed, whilst 877 other improvements were effected. You will observe by the numbers quoted above that a great change in the improved sanitary condition of the workshops has been effected and not without being a great boon to the workers themselves. I may also state that where notices have been served, I have found owners and occupiers, with only a few exceptions, willing to carry out the various requirements with as little trouble as possible. I have reported the names and addresses of 42 workshops to the Home Office not previously visited by H.M. Inspectors of Faotories. Bakehouses.—There are at present 265 bakehouses on the register, 3 having been abolished during the year, 205 have been cleansed and limewhited. During the year I have paid 651 visits to them, and it is satisfactory to note that there is much improvement in their cleanliness. I may also state that several underground bakehouses, although closed before the passing of the Bakehouses Act, 1st January, 1896, are still kept on the register, because I feel it a duty to keep them there so that they may be visited in due course with those that are occupied to see that there is no infringement of the law respecting them. Miscellaneous Trades.—As the accompanying table does not give details as to the various trades carried on under this heading, I append a list as follows:— Dressmakers. Pianoforte String Makers. Laundries. Builders. Tin-box Makers. Skin Driers. Card Box Makers. Organ Builders. Furriers. Fish Curers. Printers. Dyers. Engineers. Paper Stainers. Paper Sorters. Farriers. Rag Sorters. Tripe Dressers. Screw Makers. Tallow Melters. Cabinet Makers. Confectioners. Smoke Nuisances.—1,093 visits have been paid by me during the year in various localities in the, Parish for the purpose of taking observations of chimneys of factories and workshops. I may state that during the great coal strike in Wales, many complaints were received owing to the alleged difficulty of obtaining smokeless coal. Since then, however, it has been found necessary to serve 10 notices on offenders, and I am happy to say that they have not been served without good results following. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE WEST, Inspector of Workshops, §e. 1898] 144 BAKEHOUSES IN ISLINGTON. Reg. No. Street or Road.

At present there are 459 houses on the register, which is an increase of 66 on the number of 1897. No house was removed from the register. Number on register at beginning of year 393 Placed on register during 1898 66 459 There can be no question that the registration of houses let out in tenements to different families is a great boon, not only to the tenants but to the landlords, for the former are compelled under the by-laws to do their duty in keeping the premises clean, while the latter are equally not allowed to neglect their obligations to their tenants. Inspector Jordan's work has been very arduous, as the inspection of the houses now on the register fully occupies his time, and, indeed, were it not that he is an active officer, it is doubtful if they could be efficiently supervised. That there are very many houses in Islington that might with advantage be placed on the register goes without saying, and it is, therefore, hoped that in time they will be added to it. The process is, however, likely to be a slow one unless another Inspector is appointed to assist in this work for, at present one man has as much as he can undertake. Inspector Jordan's report shows the work which he has accomplished during 1898. Public Health Department, Vestky Offices, Upper Street, N. To A.. E. Harris, Esq., January, 1899. Medical Officer of Health, Dear Sir, In placing my report before you of the works carried out during the year 1898 under my supervision, in accordance with section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in respect to houses let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family, I may state there are 458 houses on the register, and that the work of supervision is very great. 151 [1898 Of course, some of the houses have been much improved, for after being thoroughly repaired they are let to a different class of occupiers, but the greater number require constant observation. I served 245 intimation notices as to nuisances and 357 cleansing notices. There were nine prosecutions. Three summonses were, however, withdrawn, and the others resulted in fines and costs amounting to £17. Several other prosecutions should have been taken, but were abandoned because the time taken up in preparing the evidence, in attending at the Police Court to obtain the summonses, and afterwards attending to prove the case at the hearing, which often means several adjournments, is so great that it could not be afforded unless by neglecting the inspections. During the year I have made 4,629 inspections and 924 re-inspections and calls, and have had 1,572 improvements carried out on 844 premises, the full statement attached hereto showing the details under their respective headings. In consequence of the outbreak of Measles, and in accordance with your instructions, I made 988 calls in respect to this disease. This, I venture to think, is not an unsatisactory report of 1 2 months' work. I am, Sir, Yours respectfully, JAMES J. JORDAN, Intpector of Houses let in Lodgings. 1898] 152 Table C.

Thus 6,802 houses were inspected and 59,966 re-inspections were made, which showed an increase of 880 and 2,669 respectively on the returns for the preceding year. The improvements effected were 32,212, and the premises improved 6,011. These improvements included the construction of 1,683 drains and the repair of 1,294; the fixing of 7,551 traps; the abolishing of 33 cesspools; the supply to w.c's of 1,360 pans, traps and water waste preventers; the supply of water to 250 w.c's; the supply of 1,001 dust bins, and the repair of 323 others; the pavement of 920 yards and the repavement of 1,789; the provision of 643 new receptacles for water; the repairing and cleansing of 899 existing cisterns, and the provision of a water supply to 285 houses. Of other improvements it may be stated that 401 houses were generally repaired, 526 cleansed or lime-washed, and 1,478 ventilated. 90 cases of overcrowding were abated, and 34 rooms that were illegally occupied for sleeping purposes, i.e., contrary to Sec. 96 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were closed. Besides these special matters over 8,000 minor nuisances were attended to. In addition to these duties, it must not be forgotten that the Inspectors undertake the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and that they paid 897 visits to various shops and railway stations for the purpose of obtaining samples for analysis. In the following Table the places inspected are set out:— 1898] 154 Table CI. Giving a Summary of the Sanitary Work performed by the Inspectors in 1898. Places Inspected. QUARTERS. The Year. First.

It became necessary in 206 instances to take legal proceedings for the abatement of nuisances, or for offences against the By-laws or the provisions of the Public Health Act. In 159 instances the Vestry were successful, while the cases that were lost only numbered 7, while 32 were withdrawn on the work being completed. It should be mentioned that the railway stations situated in Islington were inspected, and that sanitary work of great importance, and, indeed, in some instances, very extensive, was executed, both in the stations themselves and in the residences of the officials. 155 [1898 Table CII.

No legislation has yet been carried out with respect to the registration of the houses or places where Ice Creams are manufactured by itinerant vendors of that article. This matter is of very serious importance, and it is not too much to hope that the London County Council will see its way to introduce a clause into the proposed amendment of the Public Health (London) Act to insure that the manufacture of this article of food shall be conducted in a cleanly and healthy manner. At present the conditions under which it is made are most unsatisfactory and very often most insanitary. This question was first raised in Islington, in 1894, since which time many of the provincial towns, such as Liverpool and Glasgow have obtained supervisory powers over the premises in which Ice Creams are made. It is not always that those authorities who first bring matters under public notice are enabled to reap the earliest advantage of their advocacy. This possibly would not be so in London if Sanitary Authorities, like the Vestry of Islington, possessed powers of introducing legislation. In Liverpool and Glasgow, regulations are now in force relating to the manufacture and sale of Ice Cream with a view to prevent contamination. In the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the former city he states that during the year 1,678 visits have been made to 251 premises occupied by makers and sellers of these articles. He also states that special attention had been directed to the street traders of these commodities, and that most of the Vendors make use of premises approved by the Health Committee, thus removing to a large extent the insanitary condition under which the food was previously made. He adds these words, "a striking proof of the value of the powers recently obtained." 1898] 158 SUMMARY OF SUMMONSES.—Year ending 31st December, 1898. Prosecutions. Successful. Dismissed. Withdrawn.

The largest amount of adulteration occurred in the first quarter, when, out of 134 milks, 20, or 14•9 per cent., were adulterated, while the least adulteration took place in the second quarter, when, out of 120 samples, only 8, or 63 per cent., were wrong. Of the 193 milks procured on Sundays, 28, or 15 per cent., were adulterated. This proportion was 5 per cent. greater than that found in the milks bought on week-days, of which 23 out of 230, or 10 per cent., had been tampered with. Of the milks procured in transit at the railway stations not one was found to be adulterated, which proves that the farmers as a rule send milk into London which will pass the standard of Somerset House. The following are the figures for each quarter and lor the year of the analyses of the milks procured at Finsbury Park Station. No. of samples analysed. Fat. Solids less fat.

This was probably due to the fact that five milks gave respectively 8•0, 7•39, 9•3, 12•5, and 8•01 per cent. of fat respectively. Even with these milks with their unusual percentages of fat deducted from the total milks the remaining 25 milks showed an average of 4•44 per cent. of fat, while the solids, less fat, was 8•63 per cent., thus making the total solids 13•07 per cent. These figures prove that the milk delivered during the period was of good quality. 161 [1898 The average analyses of the milks bought 011 Sundays were as follows:— No. of samples analysed. Fat. Solids less fat.

The low figures taken by the Government chemists have been the subject of much criticism for many years back, so that it is hardly necessary now to flog a dead horse. Some day they will be doubtless altered, and not a 1898] 162 moment too soon, but meanwhile milk dealers will be able to continue to adulterate milk by the addition of water, and to remove a large quantity of the fat by means of a separator without let or hindrance. Separated Milk.—The subject of recommending special legislation with respect to the sale of this diet came before the Public Health Committee on a reference from the Vestry of Camberwell, but it was decided to take no action on it. A most important decision was given by the Court of Queens Bench in the case of Petchley v. Taylor, in which it was held that condensed "separated" milk described on the label as "skimmed" milk was wrongly designated. There cannot, of course, be any doubt as to the decision of the Court being absolute!}' correct, although it is a misfortune that the question was ever raised, because the term "separated milk" will convey little or no meaning, or a mis-leading one, to the great mass of the people, whereas everyone understood the term "skimmed milk" to mean milk deprived of its fat. It is quite true that these terms have a very distinct meaning to scientists, but it will be a long while before the public will differentiate between the two words. To them "skimmed" milk has always been understood to be "creamless" milk—milk without its fat; but "separated" milk may, and doubtless will, convey an uncertain meaning. That this may be so is proved by the fact that when condensed "separated" milk was first put on the market, the public did not understand what was meant by the word "separated" and the writer has been informed by a member of one of the largest retail grocery firms in London, that the manufacturers, in order to make the public clearly understand what they were buying, were forced to change the word "separated," which was not understood, to the word "skimmed," which was. He has also been told that a bench of Magistrates held that the term "separated" was mis-leading, and was not one that would be generally understood and that such milk should be described as "skimmed." The writer has been unable to trace this case, although he has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statement, for his authority is one that is always most reliable in matters that affect the grocery trade. 163 [1898 The ground of the opposition to the labelling of separated milk as skimmed milk is mainly that mothers, relying on the fact that skimmed milk contained some fat, gave their infants this food. Can anyone seriously believe this statement ? Have those who make it ever heard of a case where a mother, to whom it is a new fact that this milk contains fat, deliberately went into a milk shop and bought skimmed milk for her infant child ? The thing seems incredible. And if mothers do not buy the raw "skimmed" milk, why should they buy the same article in its condensed state ? The real truth is that hitherto the labels of condensed skimmed milk did not draw sufficiently prominent attention to its contents, and the food was given more through ignorance as to its quality than through deliberate intent. The new Sale of Food and Drugs Act will rectify this, as for the future the article—separated milk—will be marked legibly, so that there may be no mistake as to its ineligibility for infants. It is not generally known that there is probably, nay there is, more condensed separated milk used to-day than there is of condensed milk retaining all its cream. The introduction of mechanical means for separating the fat of milk for the making of butter has led to this. Formerly, to obtain the cream, the milk had to stand for twentyfour hours, at the end of which time, especially in the summer, the skimmed milk had turned sour. Now all this is changed, for the fat is separated more completely, and almost instantaneously, by mechanical means, so that the residue is left quite sweet and fresh. The result is that, whereas in former days "skimmed" milk was only considered good enough for the food of calves and pigs, it is now used to feed human beings. And rightly so, for it is a cheap and exceedingly valuable food for youths and adults, tens of thousands of whom use it daily in these countries. Indeed, so great is its sale that it is well-known that one great firm turns out millions of tins annually. Now anything that might prevent the people, by whom is meant the industrial classes, from using this excellent food, would be a great misfortune for them, and, therefore, the action of the action of the authority in 164 18981 raising the fine point of the difference between meaning of words "skimmed" and "separated" is to be deplored, for it has undoubtedly had the tendency of throwing considerable doubt on the value of separated milk as a food. The milk of cows consists of solids and water in about the following proportion:— Total Solids 12.83 per cent. Proteids 3.55 per cent. Fat 3.69 „ Carbo-hvdrates 4.88 „ Salts 0.71 „ Water 87.17 „ 100.00 Now as regards the fat of any food, it is pretty well known that it is a source of heat, and therefore, to an extent, of energy also, and there is no occasion to refer further to its effect on the animal economy, beyond that it is absolutely essential for the support of infant life. Hence it is found in the milk of all animals, although in varying proportions. But the same cannot be said of the Proteids or the Carbo-hydrates, the very words themselves being unknown to the mass of the people, and therefore it may be well to explain what they are as well as what their value is as a food. Proteids are the most important food stuffs, and are the only organic food substances of which it can be affirmed with certainty that they are indispensable. They are always in every animal or vegetable food, and they all resemble each other in being composed in similar weight and proportions of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, with occasionally a little phosphorus. They are the main constituents of the nitrogenous portion of all foods. It must be recollected that every structure in the body from which energy is derived is nitrogenous. Thus the nerves, muscles, glands, cells, the floating cells in the various liquids are all 165 [1898 nitrogenous. Even the non-cellular liquids passing out into the alimentary canal at various points, which have so great an action in preparing the food in different ways, are not only nitrogenous but the constancy of this implies the necessity of the nitrogen in order that these actions shall be performed ; and the same constancy of the presence of nitrogen, when function is performed, is apparently traceable through the whole world. Surely such constancy proves necessity, and hence their great necessity in all dietries. Proteids then are a most valuable food, and indeed, it is their presence in milk which gives this article its great pre-eminence as an article of diet. But proteids are also themselves a source of fats, and probably of carbo-hydrates, so that they play two parts, 1st: that of regulators of oxidation and of the transformation of energy; and 2nd: they may form a non-nitrogenous substance which is oxidised and transformed. Indeed, that fats are formed from proteids is proved by the following facts :— J. Carnivora giving suck, when fed on plenty of flesh and little fat, yield milk rich in fat. 2. A cow which produces one pound of butter daily does not take nearly this amount of fatty matter in her food, so that the fat would appear to be formed in this case from vegetable diets. The above remarks, mainly drawn from the Firth & Notter's "Theory and Practice of Hygiene," are sufficient to show the inestimable value of the proteids which are present in milk as casein and albumin, in which the proportion of nitrogen is nearly as 2 to 7. Now as regards the carbo-hydrates. These are found in plants and animals, and are so called because they contain hydrogen and oxygen in the proportion to which these occur in water, in addition to at least six atoms of carbon. Their taste is sweet and they can be readily changed into sugar by the action of diluted acids. In milk they take the form of a peculiar sugar, like cane sugar, and called lactose or sugar of milk. 166 1898] Their consumption, according to Notter & Firth, spares not only proteid food, but also fat. They lessen the need of fat by being a source of energy in the body, and thus when present in a diet poor in fat, they diminish the oxidation of fat in the body. It is generally thought, too, that fat is formed directly from carbohydrates, and the weight of evidence is in this direction, but whether it is formed directly or indirectly, there is no doubt that the consumption of carbo-hydrates results in the formation of fat within the body. Much more could be written on this subject, but enough has been said to prove that these two large constituents of separated milk are indispensable in our food, and that between them they actually supply fat to the system when consumed. Apparently, unconsciously, the working classes seem to have discovered the fact, and hence the enormous sale in its condensed form of separated milk. To retard this sale would be to deprive the labourer and artizan of a convenient, nutritious, and most excellent food; one that does not readily decompose, and which, when the can is opened, can be kept for a few days without decomposition taking place. One, too, which, owing to its sweetening properties, lessens the amount to be paid for sugar, for use with tea, coffee, cocoa or puddings. Looking on separated milk in this light, it is not too much to say that, while admitting it is not a suitable food for infants, who require fat to generate heat, it is a most excellent and nutritious food for the human adult, as well as for the growing youth, especially when partaken with meals at which butter, margarine or dripping are consumed. The food of the people is a matter of utmost consequence to the Medical Officer of Health, and, therefore, it is as much his duty to see that good foods do not come under a ban as to watch that bad foods or unwholesome foods are not offered for sale. That condensed separated milk is a good food is beyond doubt, because its composition is almost identical with that of bread, whose moisture has been reduced to the proportion contained in separated milk. 167 [1898 Boric Acid as a Preservative.—One of the questions of the hour is undoubtedly whether it is right or wrong to use this preservative for the purpose of keeping milk, butter or other foods from decomposition. At present boric acid is used as a preservative for nearly every perishable article that is used for human food. Thus, it is added to milk, butter, fish, bacon, hams, meat. So much, indeed, is it used, that it would not be safe to affirm that it is not unknowingly consumed at every meal in some one or more of the foods that are placed on the table. Its addition to milk or other foods has never been the subject of a prosecution in Islington, although it has been known to have been added to various articles that were examined, and indeed was present in 118 milks out of the 323 tested for it. It has always been felt here that some authoritative pronouncement should be made on the subject by the Local Government Board after careful inquiry into the whole subject, more especially as medical men have given evidence for and against its use. It is understood that this question is at present engaging the attention of the Government and that a Special Committee has beeu appointed to make a full investigation. 168 1898] Samples taken.

There are at present 65 Slaughter Houses in Islington. These have all been kept in good condition during the year. Indeed, their state was so satisfactory, that for the first time for many years it was not necessary for the Vestry to oppose the renewal of any of the licenses at the Annual Sessions. It is not, however, to be understood from these remarks that their improved condition justifies their continuation as slaughter houses, for every modern writer on the subject holds that, from a hygienic point of view, private slaughter houses are most undesirable. This view has been endorsed by the Vestry on at least two occasions, on each of which it has almost unanimously declared in favour of a public abattoir. From a return made not long since and submitted to the Vestry, it appears that there are 140 beasts, 19 calves, 1,187 sheep, and 20 pigs 170 1898] killed on an average every week in the parish, thus making an annual total of:— Beasts 7,280 Calves 988 Sheep 61,724 Pigs 1,040 Total Animals 71,032 But, apart from hygienic reasons, the slaughter of such a total makes it most desirable that these animals should be killed under the most humane conditions and under the closest supervision, and therefore, in a public slaughter house, managed and controlled by public officials, who would be responsible, for the method of killing, as well as for the proper examination of the carcases for disease. It is not to be understood from these remarks that any allegation is made that cruelty is practised in Islington, for that is far from its meaning, although undoubtedly more humane methods might with great advantage be practised here as elsewhere in England. The fact is that many modern devices,"adopted on the Continent, for depriving animals of their life with the minimum of suffering, are either unknown in this country, or, if known, are not generally practised.

It is scarcely possible to pass over these institutions, which are such great adjuncts to the health of a community, in a report on the sanitary condition of the district. 173 [1898 There are three such institutions in Islington, known respectively as the "Caledonian Road," "Hornsev Road," and "Tibberton Square" Baths and Washhouses, from the roads in which they are situated. They have been erected under the Baths and Washhouses Acts of 1840, 1847, 1878 and 1882, with the approval of the Local Government Board; and in the first instance were managed by Commissioners, who, however, ceased to exist in March 1896, when the Vestry took them into its care. Caledonian Koad Baths and Washhouses were opened in May, 1892, those at Hornsey Koad in July of the same year, and those at Tibberton Square in April, 1895. It would be interesting to go through the returns of the valuable work which they have accomplished since their foundation, but as it would occupy too much time and space a statement as to their usefulness during 1898 may be taken as a sample. Swimming (Plunge) Baths.—During the year 178,327 perisons, men, women and children used the Swimming (Plunge) Baths, at Hornsey Koad, 99,712 those at Caledonian Koad, and 117,327 those at Tibberton Square, making a total 395,366 persons. Of this number no less than 134,929 were scholars, of whom 36,640 were girls. It is a noteworthy fact that altogether 61,895 female bathers used the plunge baths, and for the most part for the purpose of learning to swim. The Private (Slipper) Baths were also well patronized, for 308,244 baths were provided. Tibberton Square stands first with 112,830 bathers, then comes Hornsey Koad with 110,022, and Caledonian Road with 85,392. Women bathers numbered 67,699, of whom 58,422 were patrons of the second class baths, a fact which clearly proves that such baths supply a want which is much felt by the less wealthy classes. The return of 167,716 male bathers at the second class baths goes far to show the appreciation in which they are held by the toilers of the district. The Washhouses have also done good work for 119,527 washers used them, 25,385 using Hornsey Road, 32,501 Caledonian Koad, and 61,641 Tibberton Square. When it is recollected how little accommodation there is in houses let in tenements or occupied by members of 1898] 174 more than one family, the means afforded by the washhouses for the occupiers of these houses to wash their clothes at a cheap rate, comes as a great boon, and a boon too that would be more appreciated, if their advantages were more fully and widely known. However, as it is, the attendance of nearly 120,000 washers is not a bad return for Islington, although one would wish to see it increased. The appreciation of the Swimming Baths is the most gratifying feature of the returns, for bathing, especially when the bather practices, the art of swimming with it, is not only a means to cleanliness, but to the development of the muscular system, the expansion of the frame,, particularly the broadening of the chest, the expansion of the lungs, and the strengthening of the limbs. It is a most useful exercise, which perhaps more than any other makes for health. It is gratifying to know that not only do these plunge baths afford means for bathing, but they are much patronised for the purpose of learning how to swim, an art which every man, woman and child should learn, and have even led to classes being formed for the purpose of teaching persons how to save the drowning from death. Only within the last twelve months a gentlemen, who was taught at one of these baths, while on his holiday at the seaside, recovered a person from drowning, thanks to the instruction received in one of the classes. There is no institution which the local authorities of Islington manage, with which they can be more pleased than with its Baths and Wash-houses. They are noble institutions, doing a great and good work for its health, which at present is so good that every citizen can be proud of it. So long as they are managed with a view to improving the health of the people, by holding out inducements to them to be clean in clothing as well as body, and not for the purpose of making a profit, so long will they deserve every support. They are the people's baths, erected out of the ratepayers money, solely for the promotion of health through cleanliness, and therefore, never intended to be commercial speculations. If ever they should become money making concerns, then the profits should go to improving them, and by reducing the prices, to attract the public to them in even still larger numbers; thereby cleanliness will be promoted, and therefore, improved health, moral and physical, will be assured. 175 [1898 Swimming Baths.
