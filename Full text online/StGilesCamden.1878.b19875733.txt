In compliance with the requirements of the Metropolis Management Act the Board present their Annual Report, comprising the works commenced and completed, and those in progress, the proceedings for the Removal of Nuisances, the Improvement of the Sanitary Condition of the District and the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, the Abstracts and Summaries of its Annual Accounts. The Report of the Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, is also annexed. Meetings. The following Meetings have been held during the year commencing June, 1878, and ending May, 1879:— Board Meetings 21 Finance Committee Meetings 18 Works Committee 10 Sanitary Committee 12 Special Committees on various subjects 3 In all . 64 Annual Accounts. The Accounts of the Board for 1878 are annexed. The large payments to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the London School Board, for which precepts were made on this District, amounted as follows:— For the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate (comprising Main Drainage, Fire Brigade, Sinking Fund and General Expenses), the sum of £6,823 6 4 The School Board for London 7,177 7 0 Making together £14,000 13 4 And being nearly half the expenditure of the Board.

The lavish expenditure of the London School Board still continues; it has increased from 68 per cent, in 1875 to 208 per cent, in 1877, and in the present year to 225 per cent. This subject has been discussed in the House of Commons, where (as was suggested in this Board's Report of last year) it was pointed out that the remedy is, to a certain extent, with the ratepayers, who could, by electing suitable members to that Board, prevent its enormous outlay. The Decease of Members. The Board sincerely regret to announce the deaths of Mr. Benjamin Bennett and Mr. W illiam Day, both of Southampton Row, late Members of this Board. During the period they held office they were active and attentive to their duties. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868. The Board have applied the powers given by this Act to such of the dwelling-houses forming the north side of Shelton (formerly (9) King) Street, Drury Lane, which required structural alterations or improvements. Some of the owners have complied with the orders, but others have failed to do so, and steps have in consequence been taken for shutting up the premises under the powers contained in the Act. A Bill to amend this statute is now before the House of Commons, promoted by the Member who procured that of 1868 to be passed ; the scope of such amendments being to provide compensation to owners whose premises should be ordered to be pulled down, and substituting the Metropolitan Board of Works for the Vestries and District Boards as the Local Authority. The Board petitioned against the Bill on the latter ground, and the objectionable clause was altered accordingly. The Bill is under consideration in the House of Commons at the present time. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. GREAT WILD STREET SCHEME. This Scheme is progressing; the value of the several premises to be taken under the Act have been ascertained, and the purchase of the same by the Metropolitan Board of Works is (it is reported) rapidly proceeding. LITTLE CORAM STREET SCHEME. This Scheme, the object of which was the removal of the several buildings forming Tavistock Mews, Abbey Place, Little Coram Street, Marchmont Place and Russell Place, comprising many unhealthy dwellings and the erection of suitable dwellings, was strenuously contested before the Officer appointed by the Secretary of State, and resulted in Tavistock Mews, the north end of Abbey Place and the west side of Little Coram Street being excluded, subject to certain conditions under which the freeholder of these sites is to provide in the vicinity an eligible site immediately available for a building capable of providing accommodation for 118 persons of the working class. COAL YARD AND GOLDSMITH'S ALLEY IMPROVEMENT. This Improvement has, since the last Report, been further proceeded with; the large shed and premises forming a considerable portion of the proposed new street has been purchased and paid for and removed; the only remaining property to be dealt with is a plot of land belonging to the Guardians of the Poor, the conveyance of which is now before the Local Government Board for approval. PHCENIX STREET. This street, which connects Bloomsbury and Dyott Streets, and has for several years been entirely closed at the request of the (10) owners of the property abutting on the same, was, in the month of July, 1878, opened for public traffic by day, but (to prevent nuisances and at the request of the owners) closed at night. It will, when the houses at the south side of Bucknall Street (formerly Church Lane) and the corner of Dyott Street have been removed, which is in contemplation by the freeholder, afford an almost direct street from Bloomsbury Street into Bucknall Street, and an improved access to the latter street, which is at present from Dyott Street of a narrow and tortuous character. St. Giles' Churchyard. The neglected condition of this Churchyard has long been a source of regret to the parishioners of the United Parishes, and in the past year the Yestry of St. Giles having outlaid a considerable sum in converting the same into a Garden for the use of the inhabitants, the Metropolitan Board of Works contributed thereto the sum of £150, and this Board, in the month of December last, made a contribution of £133: 18s. 6d. Water Supply. Nothing has been done towards effecting a reduction of the burdensome rates imposed by the Water Companies of the Metropolis. Conferences of several of the principal Vestries and District Boards have been held at St. Martin's Vestry Hall, and a Deputation waited on the Home Secretary on the subject, but with, it is reported, no beneficial result. Wood Paving. During the present year Wood Paving has been laid down in High Holborn from Dean Street to Bury Place, at a cost of £5,518, forming a continuous carriage paving of wood from the junction of the District with that of the Holborn Board of Works to Tottenham Court Road at the junction with the Parish of St. Marylebone. The Board have received several applications by the inhabitants of other streets in the District to lay down wood paving in the carriageways, but owing to the large cost and short duration of that class of paving, it has been compelled to postpone the consideration of all such applications until next year. Street Nomenclature. The following streets have been re-named under the Powers of the Metropolis Management Act., 18 & 19 Vict. cap. 120:— Names. Re-named. King's Head Yard and Sardinia Place. Chapel Place, Lincoln's Inn Fields Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields Sardinia Street. Bedford Street Bayley Street. Tavistock Mews Morwell Street. Orange Street Theobald's Road. (11) The houses in the following streets have been re-numbered:— Bernard Mews, Brunswick Mews, Hunter Mews, Little Guilford Street, Lumber Court, Maras Buildings, New Yard, Nottingham Court, Red Lion Yard, Southampton Mews, Stacey Street. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. Under this Act Dr. Redwood, of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, has, with the approbation of the Local Government Board, been again appointed the Analyst for the District. There have been 274 cases of analysis during the year. Proceedings were taken in 4 cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed in such cases amounted to £6: 18s. It is to be observed that the prosecutions, fines and convictions are considerably less than last year, arising partly from the decrease of adulteration and in consequence of the decision of one of the Police Magistrates that an adulterated article sold to an Inspector under the Act was not an offence, it not being to his “prejudice,” and the summons being dismissed. The practical effect of this decision, until overruled, was to render the Statute a dead letter. The objection was raised in almost every case afterwards which was sought to be dealt with before the Police Magistrates. The decision was consequently immediately appealed by the Board to the Queen's Bench Division ; that Court, on the 28th day of March last, allowed the appeal with costs, to be paid by the offender, and remitted the case to the Magistrate to impose a fine, which he did of £3 and costs. The Report of the Analyst forms a part of this Report. Sanitary Acts. There have been several cases of prosecution under these Acts, and Orders have been made by the Magistrates for the abatement of the nuisances complained of. In some instances the Board have, under their statutory powers, entered on the premises and performed the necessary works, and recovered the costs of the same from the owners. June, 1879.

Brunswick Square. Bernard Street (west end). Marchmont Street (south end). Chenies Street (west end). The whole of the remaining macadamized roads in the District were repaired, and their surfaces maintained in good order. ( 23 ) Two new crossing refuges were formed, viz., one at the north end of Endell Street, and one in Broad Street, opposite to Dyott Street, the latter being in place of one that previously existed in Broad Street at its junction with Bloomsbury Street, and which was removed. New Sewers. The following lengths of new Sewers were constructed during the year:— Arthur Street 117 ft. run of brick sewer, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. Brewer Street 93 do. do. do.

Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public ways was performed by a staff of street orderlies employed by the Board, and consisting of 35 men, viz., 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping-machines, each drawn by one horse, were used in sweeping the paved carriageways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 8.888 loads. The cost of the street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1879, was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages 1,802 9 4 Brooms, Clothing for Street Orderlies, &c. 151 8 11 Amount paid to Contractor for removing Street Sweepings 2,514 5 4 Total Cost of Street cleansing £4,468 3 7 ( 24 ) The carriageways of High Holborn, Oxford Street, and Tottenham Court Road were washed, on several occasions during the year, by means of watering-carts and the horse-sweeping machines; the cost of the washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering. Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the Contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. The water used for this purpose (including that used for street washing) was 3,192,000 gallons. The amount paid for Water, Meter hire, Repairs £ s. d. of Stand-posts, &c., was 209 4 11 To Contractors for Carts, Horses and Men 727 12 0 Total £936 16 11 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, at a cost of £1,437: 10s. Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the mews, yards, courts, alleys, &c. in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited at a cost of about £60. Public Urinals. The public urinals belonging to the Board are 19 in number, and contain 48 compartments ; 9 of the urinals, containing 33 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others have not. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. Great complaints being made by inhabitants of the offensiveness of the urinal in Parker Street, it was removed, and a new cast-iron urinal to accommodate two persons was erected in its place. ( 25 ) The following is a List of the Contracts entered into by the Board and in force up to the 25th day of March, 1879:— Name and Address of Contractor. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. J. J.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— I have the honour to lay before you the Annual Report for the year 1878, which is remarkable in being the healthiest in this District on record. It will be seen that even after correcting the number of Registered Deaths, by adding those of parishioners who died in hospitals and institutions situated out of the District, the death-rate for St. Giles was lower than that for all London. I shall again begin by placing before you some facts from the Registrar-General's "Annual Summary" relating to the Metropolis, and which will be useful for the purpose of comparison. London. "Area.—The area of London (the registration division so called) is 70,080 acres, or 122 square miles, including 2,718 acres of the Thames. "The length of the streets and roads is about 1,500 miles, and their area nearly 12 square miles. "The sewers have a length of about 2,000 miles. "Elevation.—The population of London resides at a mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high-water mark, the elevation varying from 11 feet below high-water mark in Plumstead Marshes, to 429 feet above high-water mark in Hampstead. "Houses.—At the Census of 1871 there were within this area 417,767 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7.8 persons to a house. "Annual Rateable Value.—The annual rateable value of property in the Metropolis in December, 1878, as assessed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, equal to £23,960,109. "Density (1871).—103 persons to a hectare; 42 persons to an acre: 26,674 to a square mile. "Annual Rate of Increase of Population per Cent.— 1851-61, 1.73; 1861-71, 1.50. "1878. "Population.— (Estimated to the middle of the year.) Males 1,674,351 Total 3,577,304. Females 1,902,953 "Births.— Males 65,944 Total 129,184. Females 63,240 "Annual rate of births per 1,000 of the population, 36.2. ( 29 ) "Deaths.— Males 42,865 Total 83,695. Females 40,830 "Annual rate of mortality per 1,000,— Males 25.6 Total 23.5. Females 24.4 "Excess of registered births over deaths, 45,489. "Estimated increase of population, 43,693." St. Giles District. 1878. Area in Statute Acres, 245. Density of Persons to an Acre (Census, 1871), 219. Elevation.—The average elevation of the land in this District is about 68 feet above high-water mark. Population (Census, 1871) St. George, Bloomsbury 17,843 St. Giles South 19,089 ( St. Giles North 16,497 Total 53,429 Marriages and Marriage-rate. The marriages in 1878 were 415, viz.:— Name of Building. Denomination. Number of Marriages. St. Giles in the Fields (Parish Church, High Street) Established Church 146 St. George, Bloomsbury (Parish Church, Hart Street) Established Church 155 Superintendent Registrar's Office — — 40 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields Roman Catholics. 47 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 9 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 5 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist — Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist . 5 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church 7 Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 1 Total . 415 The marriage-rate (persons married to 1,000 population) was 15.5. The rate in England and Wales in 1877, last year of publication, was 15.8. The marriages in St. Giles District, in the preceding three years, were 397, 390 and 391, and the average marriage-rate was 14.71 per 1,000. ( 30 ) Births and Birth-rate. During the year the births registered in the three Sub-Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 425 St Giles South 761 St. Giles North 430 Entire District 1,616 of which 825 were males and 791 females. These numbers do not accurately represent the birth-rate, either in the whole District or in the Sub-Districts, and require correction; for example, 21 of the births at the Workhouse were children of mothers who belonged to the Strand Union and 149 of the children born at the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street, belonged to parents residing in various parts of the Metropolis; therefore, 170 births must be deducted, both from the entire District and from the Sub-District of St. Giles South, in which they were registered. This reduces the actual number of births to 591 for St. Giles South and 1,446 for the entire District, and gives a birth-rate for the whole District of 27.0 per 1,000, or 1 in 36.94, as the ratio of births to population, and which will be seen more clearly in the following table:— Showing the Birth-rate to Population in St. Giles and its SubDistricts in 1878. Sub-Districts. Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. Average Birth-rate per 1.ooo for 10 Years, 1869-1878.

During the year the deaths registered in the three Sub.Districts were as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury 255 St. Giles South 552 St. Giles North 284 Entire District 1,091 of which 571 were males and 520 females. In order to obtain an accurate death-rate, alterations must be ( 31 ) made by deducting 56 deaths of non-parishioners, who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street; the British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street; and the Infants' Home, No. 35, Great Coram Street; and by adding 130 deaths of parishioners, who died in the several Public Hospitals and Institutions situated out of the District. Various corrections must also be made for the Sub-Districts, and the proper numbers apportioned to each. These corrections make the actual number of deaths 1,165, which gives a death-rate for the whole District of 21.8 per 1,000, or a ratio of 1 in 45.86 of population. This is the lowest death-rate in St. Giles District of which we have any authentic record. The average death-rate for the ten years, 1868-1877, was 24.42 per 1,000. The various deaths which occurred in Public Institutions, both in and out of the District, also the corrected death-rate, will be shown more clearly in the following tables:— Showing the Number of Deaths in St. Giles Workhouse, the British Lying-in Hospital, and the Infants' Home, 1878.

Deaths of Children under 1 and up to 5 Years of Age. 476 children died under 5 years of age, which gives 1 death in every 3.0 of all registered births, and 1 death in every 2.44 of all registered deaths. The infantile mortality was almost identical with that of the two preceding years, and therefore again below the average. Deaths of Persons 60 Years and upwards. 206 persons died at 60 years and upwards, giving the following rate of mortality: 1 death in every 5.65 of all registered deaths, and in every 259 of population. Special Causes of Death. (In the Order of the Registrar-General's Tables.) CLASS I.—ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The death-rate in 1878 for England and Wales, for the seven principal zymotic diseases, was 3.32 per 1,000, and an increase upon the exceptionally low rate of the previous year. The death-rate for London was equal to 4.1 per 1,000. The rate for St. Giles District was equal to 3.44 per 1,000 against the low number of 2.99 for 1877. The deaths from all the seven diseases in this district, with the exception of those from whooping-cough, were below the decennial average. I will now take the diseases in their several orders,—the total number of deaths were 203. ( 33 ) Order 1.—Miasmatic. Small-pox.—No deaths were registered from this disease in the District during the year, but 13 parishioners died from it in hospitals belonging to the managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District Board, and must be credited to us, viz., 10 at Fulham and 3 at Hampstead. These, with 4 for 1876, and 14 for 1877, make up a total of 31 deaths for St. Giles District, from the commencement of the epidemic, in 1876, to this date. This fatality is comparatively light, considering the density of the population in many parts of the District. During the 3 years this disease has at no time been endemic with us, but has appeared from time to time in various parts of the 3 Sub-Districts. The speedy removal of infected patients to the small-pox hospitals undoubtedly prevented the spread of the disease, so that it never became epidemic in the District. As to the hospital accommodation for non-pauper cases, I entirely concur with the opinions of the Limehouse and other District Boards and Vestries, as expressed in their memorial, viz., "That the most practical way of overcoming the difficulty in providing hospital accommodation for non-pauper cases in each District would be for the Metropolitan Asylums District Board, who already have the necessary staff and appliances, to make arrangements, upon the request of the sanitary authorities, to receive any person not in receipt of parish relief, whom the sanitary authorities might require to have removed to hospital, and that the Asylums Board should provide a separate department for the accommodation of such cases, so that they can be kept distinct from pauper cases." Considering the severity and long continuance of the present epidemic, it is to be regretted that the Local Government Board refused the inquiry suggested by the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board "into the causes and conditions which protract the present epidemic of small-pox," for undoubtedly much information might have been obtained about "Vaccination "Revaccination," "Hospital Accommodation," and "Removal by Ambulances," &c., &c., which would be invaluable to local authorities and their officers in their endeavour to arrest the spread of infectious diseases. The following table respecting vaccination in St. Giles District has been supplied to me with the usual courtesy by Mr. Yardley, the vaccination officer appointed by the Guardians:— c ( 34 ) Return respecting Vaccination of Children, WHOSE Births were Registered during the Year. (For the period from July 1st, 1877, to June 30th, 1878.) Registration Sub-Districts comprised in Vaccination Officers' District. 1 Number of Births returned in Birth List Sheets. Number of these Births duly entered in Columns 10, 11 and 13 of the Vaccination Register (Birth List Sheets), viz.

Scarlet Fever.—This District did not experience the severe fatality from this disease, which prevailed over London during a portion of the past year. Our recorded deaths were 10 (the lowest number since 1873), including the deaths of parishioners in hospitals out of the District. Diphtheria.—6 deaths were registered, being about the average. Whooping-Cough raged epidemically over the Metropolis, and was more fatal in 1878 than in any previous year, with the exception of 1866. We lost 65 children, 26 of whom were infants under 1 year of age, 37 over 1 and under 5 years, and 2 above 5 years. Fever (Enteric or Typhoid).—There were 19 deaths, including those of parishioners who died in hospitals situated out of the District ; this number, though large, was 5 below the average. The first cases reported occurred in the spring of the year in Dudley Street; on visiting the houses with your surveyor, sanitary defects, structural and otherwise, were discovered, and orders were issued to remedy them, but these were unheeded, so that legal proceedings were taken. The magistrate convicted with costs, and ordered the works to be carried out within 14 days. The disease, which had been gradually increasing all over London, re-appeared in the autumn in several parts of this District, and caused 11 deaths. One of the places in which fever occurred was the cow-shed and dairy, No. 1½, Little Wild Street, where a child was found lying ill in a bedroom directly over the cow lair. I endeavoured, with the concurrence of the medical attendant, to obtain the father's consent to remove the child to hospital, but was unsuccessful, the patient therefore remained under treatment at home. Happily the milk was not infected, and the disease did not spread, or serious consequences might have followed in this densely-populated neighbourhood. At the annual licensing day, your Board ordered the granting of the licence to be opposed, on the ground of the insanitary condition of the premises; and at the adjourned meeting of Middlesex Magistrates, held at Freemasons' Tavern on the 3rd December last, the justices, having heard the evidence of your officers, refused the licence. Recently, under powers conferred upon them by the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, the Privy Council have framed bye-laws for the regulation of cow-sheds, dairies and milk shops, one of the principal objects of which is to prevent the spread of infectious disease through the milk. Erysipelas caused only 3 deaths. Metria (Puerperal or Lying-in Fever).—3 females died from it, against 13 for the previous year. DIARRHŒA.—There were 50 deaths, and 42 were infants under C 2 ( 36 ) 1 year of age, and only 3 were adults; the heaviest mortality prevailed amongst the children of parents living in the poorest parts of the District. The misuse of feeding-bottles is a great source of diarrhœa in infancy. Rheumatism.—5 deaths were recorded. Order 2.—Enthetic. Syphilis.—There were 12 deaths, and 11 were infants under 1 year of age. Order 3.—Dietic. Alcoholism.—5 deaths were registered from the abuse of alcohol, but these do not include those returned by the Coroner as "Accelerated by Drinking Habits." Order 4.—Parasitic. Thrush caused the deaths of 2 children. CLASS II.—CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASES. The total number of deaths in this second great class was 195, which were included in the following two orders:— Order 1.—Diathetic. The three principal diseases of this order caused the following deaths:—Gout, 2; Dropsy, 10; and Cancer, 13. Order 2.—Tubercular. Scrofula.—4 deaths. Tabes Mesenterica (Mesenteric disease).—7, all children. Tubercular Meningitis (Water on the Brain).—26, all children. Phthisis (Consumption).—132. The deaths from this disease are distributed amongst the three Sub-Districts as follows:— St. George, Bloomsbury, 28; St. Giles North, 30; and St. Giles South, 74. As usual, the latter Sub-District supplied the excess in deaths from this terrible complaint. CLASS III.—LOCAL DISEASES. This great class, which is sub-divided into eight orders, accounts for 489 deaths—nearly half the total number of deaths registered in the District from all causes. Order 1.—Nervous System. Caused 101 deaths. The three most important diseases of the order were Apoplexy, 30; Paralysis, 24; and Convulsions, 32 (all children). ( 37 ) Order 2.—Organs of Circulation. Heart Disease, 43; Aneurism, 2. 24 of these deaths occurred between the ages of forty and sixty. Order 3.—Respiratory Organs. Bronchitis again stands first in the order of fatality, and caused no less than 218 deaths. Pneumonia was fatal in 46 cases. The two diseases carried off 280 persons; of these, 109 were children under five years of age; 126 adults over forty years of age; and only 45 between the ages of five and forty. The deaths in the three Sub-Districts were—St. George, Bloomsbury, 58; St. Giles North, 59; and St. Giles South, 147. The latter Sub-District keeps up its numbers and, probably, will continue to do so until the proposed improvements in Drury Lane and Great Wild Street are carried out under the "Artizans Dwellings Act, 1875." The wretched courts and alleys in this neighbourhood will be then done away with, and properly-constructed houses be erected for the working classes on the site. Order 4.—Digestive Organs. The only important disease in this order, as to its fatality, was Liver disease, which caused 21 deaths. Order 5.—Urinary Organs. Order 6.—Organs of Generation. Order 7.—Organs of Locomotion. Order 8.— Integumentary System. A number of diseases are comprised in these 4 orders, but the only serious loss we experienced was from Bright's kidney disease, which was fatal in 11 cases. CLASS IV.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. This class contains 4 orders, viz. (1) diseases of children, (2) of adults, (3) of old age, and (4) of nutrition. The total deaths were 160. Order 1.—Diseases of Children. The 2 most important diseases in this order were premature birth, which caused 25 deaths, and teething 11 deaths. Order 2.—Diseases of Adults. Childbirth caused 6 deaths. Order 3.—Diseases of Old People. Forty-three persons died from old age, and 17 of these were above 80 years of age. ( 38 ) Order 4.—Diseases of Nutrition. Atrophy and debility caused 74 deaths. CLASS V.—VIOLENT DEATHS, &c. There were 36 deaths in the 4 orders of this class, the only one to be commented on is— Order 1.—Accident or Negligence. There were 12 deaths from fractures, falls and contusions, and 9 from suffocation, 8 being infants accidentally suffocated in bed. The various causes of death (under Class V.) returned by the Coroner are more clearly set forth in the following table:— Inquests. Eighty-six inquests were held, 50 of the deaths were returned from "natural" causes, 28 from "accidental" causes, and 8 from "wilful" or "suicidal" causes. 18 of the deaths belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury; 47 „ „ St. Giles South; 21 „ „ St. Giles North. The verdicts of the juries may be classified thus:— Cause of Death. Total. Natural causes. Diseases of the heart, aorta and aneurism 11 Diseases of the respiratory and pulmonary organs 18 Diseases of the brain and spinal cord 14 Diseases of the alimentary canal, liver and kidneys 7 Accidental causes. Suffocation (1 adult and 8 infants) 9 Fractures and contusions Falls in the streets 7 Falls down stairs 4 Fall off a hansom cab 1 Burn 1 Other causes 6 Wilful causes.

Pistol shot through brain 1 Haemorrhage from cutting arm with razor 1 Hanging 1 Wounds, &c. 3 Total 86 ( 39 ) The Workhouse, Broad Street. During the year 185 deaths occurred at the Workhouse. 1st Quarter 44 2nd Quarter 43 3rd Quarter 42 4th Quarter 56 Total 185 Of these 22 belonged to the Strand Union by previous residence. There were also 47 deaths of parishioners in the Cleveland Street Hospital of the Central Sick Asylum Board, 3 at Hampstead, 4 at Stock well, and 10 at Fulham Hospitals, making a total of 249 pauper deaths. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. Births.—175 children were born in the British Lying-in Hospital, of whom 86 were males and 89 females. Of these 6 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury, 13 to St. Giles South, 7 to St. Giles North, and 149 (by previous residence of their mothers) to various parts of the Metropolis. Only 1 case of twins occurred during the year. There were no still-born children. Deaths.—10 died in the Institution, viz., 2 mothers and 8 children. One mother died from "Ruptured Perineum and Puerperal Fever, the other from "Shock after Delivery, by 'Laparo-Elytrotomy.” Of the children,4 died from "Debility," 2 from "Premature Birth," 1 from "Erysipelas," and 1 from "Inanition." The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Great Russell Street. Dr. Steele, the Resident Medical Officer, has kindly given me the following information respecting the medical and surgical work performed by the Staff of the Institution during the past year. This Return, both in sick and death lists, shows a reduction of numbers from the following year:— The Number of New Cases treated at the Bloomsbury Dispensary, 1878. Physician's Cases.

There were 13 deaths at this "Home" during the year, all children of "female domestic servants," and under 6 months of age. The causes of death were as follows:— Diarrhoea 5, bronchitis 3, debility 2, pneumonia 1, convulsions 1, and enteritis 1. I am still of opinion that this and similar Institutions where infants are nursed should be placed directly under Government supervision. Deaths Registered, but not Certified. Five deaths were registered as uncertified, which is about the average number for this District. For public security it should be obligatory to hold an inquest where no medical certificate is produced to the local registrar. Sanitary Work. An account of the sanitary work carried out under the supervision of Inspector Walters and the late Inspector O'Donnell will be found in Table VI., Appendix; but this does not represent the whole work done, for much is effected in the cleansing, &c. of houses by verbal request of the inspectors to owners of property, without the formal notices of your Board. The late Inspector O'Donnell was attacked with pleurisy at the beginning of November, and after many weeks' illness died from it in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Proceedings under the Sanitary Acts.—Statutory notices issued by the Board were attended to in the majority of instances; 23 owners were summoned to the police courts and ordered by the magistrate to carry out the necessary works, which have been done. Overcrowding.—Twenty-four notices were served upon owners to reduce overcrowding on their premises, and were attended to in every case. Doubtless there is much overcrowding in many parts of St. Giles, but the difficulty is to detect it, for during the legal hours of inspection, many of the inmates are away from their rooms and do not return until night, so that the correct numbers cannot always be ascertained. Many of the cases of overcrowding are discovered only by anonymous information. Underground Dwellings.— Several illegally-occupied rooms were closed by the order of your Board. Dangerous Structures.—11 dangerous structures were reported by the Sanitary Inspectors, and due notices given to the District Surveyor. Nuisances from Animals (Pig-keeping).—The only 2 cases reported during the year were for keeping pigs. In October 2 small pigs were discovered in the kitchen of No. 8, Hyde Street, and 3 pigs were found in a stable at 7, Bhoades Mews. Notices were served on the owners for the nuisances to be abated forthwith. ( 41 ) Slaughter-Houses.—On the 29th October the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, granted licences for slaughter-houses to the following butchers, the works previously required by the Sanitary Committee having been performed:— Locality. No. 6, Drury Lane „ 11, Kenton Street „ 23, Store Street „ 11, Marchmont Street ,, 36, Marchmont Street „ 82, Marchmont Street (at Compton Mews) Licensees. Mr. Elan. Mr. Dunford. Mr. Balch. Mr. Edwards. Mr. Yernum. Mr. Philp. Cow-Houses.—Licences were also granted at the same time, on similar conditions, to the following cow-keepers:— Locality. Licensees. No. of Cows allowed. No. 1, Coal Yard Mr. Lewis. 10 ,, 15, Drury Lane Mr. Gibson. 8 „ 19, Tavistock Mews Messrs. Bonner and Coper. 12 „ 56, Great Coram Street 4 Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868 (Torrens). During the year I reported on the unhealthy condition of the premises Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, and 43, Shelton (formerly King) Street, Drury Lane. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875 (Cross). Representation No. 1 (Great Wild Street area.)—The final award of Sir Henry Hunt, C.B., in the matter of the above-named Act and Scheme, has been deposited at the Home Office, Whitehall. We may therefore hope that the demolition of the wretched property in this neighbourhood will soon take place, and that new and suitable dwellings for the working classes be erected on the site. Representation No. 2 (Little Coram Street area.)—My report to the Metropolitan Board of Works, relating to the above area, was taken into consideration by the Board, and a resolution passed, to the effect that the said area was unhealthy, and that an Improvement Scheme ought to be made in respect thereof. ( 42 ) A public local inquiry was held by order of the Secretary of State for the Home Department, by Mr. D. Cubitt Nicholls, at your Board's Offices, No. 199, High Holborn, in March last, for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of my official representation as to the area and the sufficiency of the Scheme provided for its improvement and to any local objections to such Scheme. The inquiry lasted six days, and was subject to great opposition on the part of various owners. Mr. D. C. Nicholls has since made his Report to the Home Secretary, who has made a provisional order in respect of the property to be laid before Parliament, subject to certain conditions and modifications. The low death-rate in the District during the past year bears evidence of its healthy condition, and must be a source of congratulation to the Board for its efforts in the sanitary improvement of the District. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, S. R. LOVETT, Medical Officer of Health. June, 1879. APPENDIX.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS OF THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen,— During the year ending on the 31st of last March I received from your Inspector, Mr. Hoyle, 274 samples for analysis, consisting of bread, butter, flour, cocoa, coffee, milk, condensed milk, arrowroot, corn-flour, preserved peas, porter, pickles, lard, mustard, vinegar, and Cayenne-pepper. Of these samples 22 were found to be adulterated, that is, 8 per cent. of the whole number. This proportion of adulterated articles compares favourably with those of previous years, and especially as the number above given includes some cases in which there was but slight evidence of adulteration, and in which, therefore, further proceedings were not taken. The great bulk of the cases of adulteration are still those of milk. There have also been several cases of adulterated butter, in which the material sold under that name has been made up either wholly or partially of other fat than butter-fat. Large quantities of fat are now specially prepared for use as a substitute for butter, and are sold under the name of butterine or bosh. The best samples of this prepared fat are wholesome and not unpalatable, but they are inferior to good genuine butter, and should only be sold under a name that would distinguish them from true butter, and at a price considerably below that of butter. Only a few samples of beer have been analysed during the past year, and in these no evidence of adulteration has been found. There is reason to believe, however, that a large proportion of the beers sold at public-houses are not, when sold, in the state in which they were received from the breweries. It is, I ( 54 ) believe, a common practice for the retailers of beer to dilute it by the addition of water, at the same time adding sugar, and sometimes salt; but in the existing state of the law it is difficult to get the evidence required to sustain a conviction in such cases, partly because there is no legally available definition of what the strength and composition of beer should be, and also because the law does not authorize the collection of samples for analysis from wholesale dealers, so as to enable the analyst to compare the article which is professed to be sold with that which is actually supplied. I have, at the instigation of your Clerk, Mr. Jones, suggested to the President of the Local Government Board that, in the Bill now before Parliament for amending the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, some provision should be made by which the detection of the adulteration of beer, such as I have alluded to, might be facilitated. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD. 17, Bloomsbury Square, 23rd June, 1879.
