MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1864. With Table of Causes of Deaths, &c. To the Vestry of Saint James and, Saint John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I do myself the honor of laying before you my Ninth. Annual Report upon the sanitary state of the district for the past year, 1864, with a statement of the causes of deaths, and a review of the principal points referred to in the Reports presented to you at your ordinary meetings. The number of deaths which occurred from all causes in the district during the year 1864, was 1735; the average of the last ten years being 1455. During the last 8 years, the total numbers ot deaths have been as follows: in 1857, 1406; in 1858, 1477; in 1859, 1374; in 1860, 1383; in 1861, 1494; in 1862, 1572; in 1863, 1509; in 1864, 1735. In each year a certain number of deaths of the Inhabitants takes place in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for 1864, amounts to 111. The births which took place during the year were 2224; the natural increase of the population thus being 489; in the preceding year the births were 2449. The number of deaths from Zymotic* diseases in 1864, was 435; that for the preceding 7 years having been respectively 340, 327, 329, 266, 381, 422, and 411. The number of deaths which occurred from the principal Zymotic diseases was 378; the kinds of disease, as also the number occuring during the preceding 6 years being shown in the subjoined table. *This term, which wag first proposed by Dr. Farr, of the Registrar General's Office, is now generally employed for brevity to signify Infectious, Epidemic, and Endemic diseases. 14  Small Pox.

In the preceding 7 years the numbers were 663, 656, 628, 624, 707, 724, and 728. 351 deaths took place in persons at and above 60, including 55 at and above 80; the corresponding number for the preceding year being 248. 347 deaths took place from pulmonary diseases, the number for the preceding year being 262. 167 deaths at all ages in the Workhouse, 91 of them occuring in persons at and above 60. The number of deaths at all ages, in 1859, was 120; in 1860, 137; in 1861, 160; in 1862, 172; and in 1863, 158. 42 deaths took place in the House of Correction; and 5 in the House of Detention; the numbers forthe preceding year being 21 and 1. The accidental deaths were 22, against 19 in 1863, viz: 5 from fractures and contusions, 6 from burns and scalds, 9 from suffocation, and 2 from other causes. One death arose from murder, that of a newly-born infant; and 8 deaths from suicide, viz: 2 from poison, 5 from hanging, and 1 from a violent fall. 15 134 inquests were held in the year; 106 upon those whose death had arisen from natural causes; 19 upon cases of accidents; 8 of suicide; and 1 of murder. 42 of these inquests were held in the House of Correction, and 5 in the House of Detention. The table appended to this report contains a list of the deaths arising from all causes, arranged according to the causes which produced them, and the ages at which they occurred. These are the principal facts relating to the causes of death, and upon them I will offer a few remarks. In regard to the total mortality, it is evident that the deaths were more numerous by 226 than in the preceding year. The census of 1861 showed that the population of this district was not rapidly increasing, the annual increase being 90 only ; and the number of births being even less than that of the preceding year, tends to confirm the view that the increase of mortality does not arise from increase of population. In considering the state of mortality of a single district, it is always a matter of interest to compare it with that of the entire metropolis, so as to be enabled to determine whether the increase is local or general. The mortality of the entire metropolis during the preceding year 1863 was 72,346, while that of 1864 was 77,723; hence there was an increase of 5377 deaths; so that the year was unhealthy throughout the metropolis. In investigating minutely the several causes of deaths, we are naturally led first to consider the Zymotic diseases, these being more immediately under control than most of the others. By reference to the table at page 14, it will be seen that the Zymotic mortality is almost exactly the same as that of the two preceding years, so that the general increase cannot be attributed to these diseases. The deaths from Small Pox have fallen from 26 to 7, which number is still too great, for undoubtedly if vaccination were properly carried out, a death from this horrible complaint would be rare. In the early part of the year, hand-bills were posted about the parish near the dwellings of the poor, so that all might know when and where they could take their children to be vaccinated gratuitously. During the year 42 patients were sent to the Small Pox Hospital, of whom 8 died. The deaths from Measles increased from 44 to 73, while those from Scarlet Fever fell from 146 to 94; of the latter 8 were registered as arising from Diphtheria. The deaths from Hooping Cough suffered a slight increase from 66 to 71. As mortality from Measles and Hooping Cough depends mainly upon pulmonary complications, the temperature of the year having been below the average, would tend to favor this increase. The mortality from Diarrhoea and Typhus has also undergone an increase. Many of the deaths from Diarrhoea, 72 of which occurred in children under 5, arise from want of care and attention to the feeding. Many mothers have to work and leave their infants to be fed when they 16 should be suckled, which will always cause an undue mortality in a working community, but as this agency is constantly at work, we must look elsewhere for the cause of the absolute increase. The deaths from Diarrhoea however were equally too numerous through out the metropolis, the number being greater than in any preceding year, excepting the Cholerayears, 1849 and 1854, and the year 1857, when Cholera prevailed in the continent, but did not affect us. Hence this great mortality from Diarrhoea may probably be attributed to the existence of a Choleraic constitution of the air, if the term may be allowed. The deaths from Typhus have increased to a small extent in this District, but it has prevailed epidemically in the metropolis generally. 49 patients were sent to the Fever Hospital in the year, of whom 9 died ; 9 of these were sent from Eagle Place, and 5 from Smith's Place, both localities well known to the Vestry as being overcrowded and occupied by those who pay but little attention to personal cleanliness, and the ordinary rules of healthy living. The deaths from Consumptive diseases increased from 248 to 283 ; and those from Pulmonary affections from 262 to 347; this increase makes up a great portion of the total increase of mortality. It must bo attributed to the very severe cold which prevailed during the early weeks of the year especially, in which the exposed thermometer fell as low as 6° & 7° F. And it may be remarked that in the second week of the year, 65 deaths were registered, including 26 of persons over 60 years of age, the average weekly number of deaths being about 30. Bakehouses. Towards the end of October the Bakehouses of the District were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself, to ascertain that the provisions of the "Act for the regulation of the Bakehouses" were properly carried out. The requirements of this act are briefly : 1. That no person under the age of 18 be employed in a Bakehouse between the hours of 9 o'clock at night and 5 in the morning. 2. That the inside walls and ceiling of every Bakehouse, and the passages and staircase leading thereto, be either painted or lime-washed, or partly painted and partly lime-washed; the paint to be renewed once in 7 years, and washed with hot soap and water at least once in every 6 months, and the lime-washing to be renewed once at least every 6 months. 3. That every Bakehouse be kept clean and provided with means of proper ventilation, and be free from the effluvia of any drain, privy, or other nuisance. 4. That no place on the same level as the Bakehouse and forming part of the same building be used as a sleeping-place, unless it be effectually separated from the Bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and unless there be an external glazed window of at least 9 superficial feet area; of which at least 4½ feet are made to open for ventilation. The number of Bakehouses was 77, 38 being situate in the upper 3 wards, and 39 in the 2 lower. 17 On inspection, they were found to be of very different kinds ; some being large, high, airy, and well ventilated, while others were very small, low, and close, in fact by no means suitable for the purposo, with due regard to the health of the workmen. 51 of them were found to be in tolerably good order; 17 of them however required to be lime-washed, and 9 were in a more seriously defective state, such as being dirty and offensive, without traps to the drains, containing pigs, &c.; and in one a bed with pillows was found. The necessary orders for the removal of these nuisances were made. Slaughter-houses. The Slaughter-houses were also inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself. They were 41 in number, kept by 40 butchers. It may be well to state briefly the conditions upon the fulfilment of which the Slaughter-houses are licensed, as they have not been issued since the licenses were first required. They are:— That no part of the premises used as a Slaughterhouse be inhabited; that the walls be properly lime-whited; that the paving be laid in cement; that there be a properly constructed drain, with a suitable trap to prevent the animal matter from entering the drain; that there be a proper water supply; with receptacles for holding the garbage until its removal, and that no accumulation of refuse be allowed upon the premises. These conditions were found to be very fairly complied with, the principal defects consisting of imperfections in the cement of the paving, which were ordered to be remedied. Cowhouses. The cowhouses were also inspected. They wero 32 in number, kept by 29 Cow-keepers, the number of cows being 652. The numbers for the preceding year were 32, 28, and 669 respectively. The conditions required for the licensing of the Cowhouses, are: that they be properly lighted and ventilated ; that they and the adjoining yards be properly paved and drained; that there be a proper supply of water; a properly constructed dung pit; and that grain bins or pits be kept clean and in good repair: that the Cowhouses be cleaned twice, and the yards once a day; that the dung be swept up twice a Hay, and removed three times a week before 8 o'clock in the morning; and that the Cowhouses be lime-whited at least twice every year. Wherever Cowhouses are kept in the metropolis, there must be a nuisance arising from the effluvia evolved by the decomposing dung and the fermenting grains. But if the above regulations were properly carried out, the nuisance would be reduced to a minimum. In most cases the nuisance has not been sufficient to give rise to complaint, but in two or three instances were cows are kept in large numbers, the complaints made have been great and frequent. Sanitary Improvements. The following are the principal Sanitary improvements which have been effected in the year: 118 feet of new sewer have been laid down; 3 sewers have been repaired and 67 cleansed; 5 new gullies have been constructed, 4 trapped, 19 repaired, 18 and 288 cleansed; 32 house-drains laid down, 2 trapped; 41 houses drained; 30 cesspools have been destroyed and filled up, and waterclosets substituted for them; 152 loads of soil have been taken out and removed from the sewers and gullies; and 1 new urinal erected. The meteorology of the year is given in the following table:— 1864. Temperature, mean Difference from mean of 93 Years. Dew Point. Humidity. (Saturation=100.) Height of Barometer. Rain, in inches Difference from average of 47 Years.

While the quantity of rain which fell during the year was very considerably less than the average. I have the honor to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, November, 1865. J. W.
