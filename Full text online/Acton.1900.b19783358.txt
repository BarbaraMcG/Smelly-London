ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the YEAR 900. BY G. A. GARRY SIMPSON, M.R.C.S., L.S.A., Fellow of the Royal Institute of Public Health, Medical Officer of Health, Acton, W. ACTON: Printed by J. Knowles, 5 and 6, Market Place. 1901. The Urban District Council of Action. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER for the year 1900. To the Chairman and Members of the Acton District Council. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of Acton during 1900. The population shows a marked increase compared with preceding years; and our death rate of 137 per 1,000 is remarkably low, taking into consideration the number of children resident in the district. The neighbourhood is being rapidly built upon, and new estates are being opened up; this, together with the improved method of locomotion by means of electricity will make Acton one of the most accessible and desirable suburbs of London. The chief works of Sanitary interest during the year have been:— The experiments in connection with the Bacterial Treatment of our Sewage; the Building and Opening of a most perfect and up-to-date Mortuary; the determination of the Council to erect Baths; and preliminary arrangements have been made for the purchase of an 4 extensive and suitable site, on high ground North of the town, for our much needed Isolation Hospital. I am now, in conjunction with your surveyor, considering sketches for the construction of the same. A long-felt want has been supplied by the erection of sanitary conveniences for both sexes in the park. Similar arrangements are badly wanted in the centre of the town, and I trust this matter will soon engage your attention. I am pleased to state that the work of the Sanitary Department is being carried on in a satisfactory manner. I have received most valuable help from your Sanitary Inspector Mr. Kinch, and also from Nurse Dawkins, to both of whom I tender my sincere thanks. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, G. A. GARRY SIMPSON. 5 POPULATION. Every year as we move onwards from the census of 1891 all vital calculations become more and more doubtful; but it is only a question of a few months, and we shall once more have a correct estimation of the population of Acton. Adopting the usual method of allowing six persons to each occupied house, the population is assumed to be 38,406. It will be interesting to see how far these figures coincide with the true census which will shortly be taken. The number of inhabited houses in the middle of 1900 was 6,401. The following table shows the number of the population and inhabited houses at the four preceding censuses:— Year. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1861 610 3,151 1871 1,568 8,306 1881 2,844 17,110 1891 4,084 24,207 The number of the population and inhabited houses since 1896. Year. Inhabited Houses.

During the year 1900 there were 1,080 births registered: of these 542 were males, and 538 were females. The birth rate per 1,000 persons living was 28.1. The London birth rate was 28 6. The following table shows the births since 1890. Year. Number of Births. 1890 704 1891 772 1892 763 I893 831 1894 834 1895 874 1896 894 1897 973 1898 995 1899 1,068 1900 1,080 DEATHS. General Mortality.—There were 528 deaths registered. The deaths comprised 237 males, and 291 females. The recorded general death-rate was 137 per 1000. The London death-rate was 18.3.

The following table compares the death-rate of children under one year per 1,000 registered births, and the birth-rate for the last fourteen years:— Birth-rate per Thousand.

Acting on the instructions received from the Registrar General, under the heading of " Diarrhoea," I have included deaths certified as from Diarrhoea alone, or in combination with some other cause of ill defined nature; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic Enteritis, Zymotic Enteritis, Epidemic Diarrhoea, Summer Diarrhoea, Dysentery and Dysenteric diarrhoea, Choleraic Diarrhoea, Cholera, Cholera Nostras, (in the absence of Asiatic Cholera), 10 According to the previous methods of classification I could have shown a marked diminution in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, but the method as now suggested is more satisfactory. The number of deaths from Diarrhoea in each district was as follows:— acton. s. acton. e. acton. a. green. willesden. b. park. 19 l8 - 9 - 2 Diarrhoea is one of the epidemic diseases that has shown no tendency to decrease with the advance of sanitation, and its prevention is a subject of anxious interest to those responsible for the health of a District. One of the primary causes in this district lies in the fact that the mothers wean their children very early, so as to be able to continue their work at the laundries. The children are left to the younger members of the family, or put out to nurse with perhaps some equally ignorant person who has no idea as to the suitable food to give a child brought up by hand. Thus, at a very early age, an unhealthy condition of the intestine is set up, and the child's vitality being further lowered by possible bad ventilation and overcrowding, it easily falls a prey to the disease, should it swallow the specific organism. Recent researches have drawn attention to a micro-organism which is found in the intestine of the horse. These bacteria are deposited in the streets in enormous numbers, and, when dry, are blown about in the form of dust, which finds its way into house larders, milk shops, and restaurants, and contaminates the food exposed therein. Milk is an excellent breeding ground for bacteria; and this fact may explain why town infants, who are fed mainly on milk, are so subject to the disease, which is hardly found in the country, where the road dust is practically free from horse dung. A hot summer supplies the temperature which favours the growth and multiplication of the microbes. 11 MEANS TAKEN FOR LOWERING THE MORTALITY FROM DIARRHŒA. The following leaflet was freely distributed in the early Summer months. Instructions as to the suitable food to give a child brought up by hand are given to each person registering a birth. ACTON DISTRICT COUNCIL. Printed and Circulated by order of the Sanitary Authority. The PREVENTION of SUMMER & INFANTILE DIARRHŒA. Summer Diarrhœa is a very fatal form of Diarrhœa, due to germs, or microbes. Thousands of children die from it every year, yet the complaint may be avoided by the exercise of common care. The germs that cause the disease are found in dust of streets, dust-bins, and where there is decaying matter. It is therefore very important to keep all dust and flies away from the food, which should be kept covered over and stored in a cool and clean compartment, away from dust-bins, closets, or drains. All milk should be boiled, and should be kept covered over prior to use. Never give a child or infant unboiled milk. The house should be kept as clean as possible. All animal and vegetable refuse should be burnt. Water closets and drains should be kept sweet and clean, any obstruction to the drainage should at once be reported to the Sanitary Inspector at the District Council Offices, High Street. See that your dust-bin is cleared at regular intervals. If there is any delay write to the Surveyor of the Council. 12 Keep your children from eating unripe or over-ripe fruit. It is most important to remove all dust adhering to fruit, and this precaution applies especially to fruit purchased from street barrows. The ices sold in the street often contain very poisonous microbes. A previous case of Summer Diarrhœa in a house will cause the disease to spread to other children if care is not taken. All diapers used by children should be placed in boiling water immediately they are soiled, and it is a wise precaution to disinfect with strong solution of Carbolic the bowel discharges of all Diarrhœa patients before they are thrown down the water closet. Send at once for a qualified medical man in every case of diarrhœa. G. A. Garry Simpson, Medical Officer of Health. The dairies, cowsheds and milkshops are periodically visited, and I insist on the following very important precautions being taken, viz.: that the milk should be always kept covered over with a damp cloth, and the cans finally washed with boiling water, which destroys any microbes that may be present. A fresh register has been made of all dairies, and for the future only those premises that are considered suitable will be placed on the register. I made during the year excursions to farms in the country which supply the milk to the largest dairies in the district. The cows appeared healthy and I could find no evidence of Tuberculosis. On two occasions I was fortunate in timing my visit for the milking hour, and I gave the men special instructions about washing their hands before milking; from personal inspection I am convinced that this precaution is not enforced as rigorously as it should be. 13 It is most important that scavenging should be carried on with particular vigour during the summer months ; our object is to keep the dust of the streets from entering the houses and settling on the food, which in the poorer districts is often left exposed in the living room. INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND THE MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT THEIR SPREAD. The following table gives the number reported each year since the Act came into force: 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 Small Pox — — 13 7 2 — — — — — 2 Scarlet Fever 108 63 74 192 86 67 193 93 167 111 243 Diphtheria 14 8 27 41 22 32 23 89 35 49 28 Membranous Croup 4 — 13 1 — — — 4 — — 1 Typhoid Fever 13 13 15 19 15 28 14 10 9 46 29 Continued Fever — — — 1 — — — — — — 2 Puerperal Fever 1 — 1 2 1 3 3 — 1 — — Erysipelas 22 18 37 77 41 31 26 25 22 31 28 162 102 180 340 167 161 259 221 234 239 333 It will be seen from the above table that 333 notification certificates of Infectious Illness were received from medical practitioners, as against 239 during the preceding year. The usual method of dealing with infectious cases in this district is as follows: On receipt of a notification from the certifying Practitioner, notice is forwarded with as little delay as possible to the Sanitary Inspector, Nurse Dawkins, the Librarian, and the Master of the School where the child or any inmates of the house attend. A small Pamphlet giving advice as to Isolation, &c., is also forwarded to the parents or some other responsible person in the house. 14 Nurse Dawkins visits the patient with as little delay as possible; takes disinfectants, sees to isolation, and visits the patient periodically till convalescence ensues. If it is found impossible to satisfactorily isolate the patient, an attempt is made to remove the case to an Isolation Hospital. The Sanitary Inspector visits the house in the course of a day or two, and tests the drains, &c. When the premises are ready for disinfection I forward a printed notice to the Sanitary Inspector. For more thoroughly disinfecting rooms a spray was purchased, the container of which is filled with a solution of Perchloride of Mercury (1 in 1000);and the walls and ceiling and all articles of furniture in the infected room are well sprayed with the solution before being sulphured. After disinfection a printed form is left with full instructions when, and how to open the room. A counterfoil signed by the tenant is kept, so that no misunderstanding on this point can now arise. Also in the case of removing bedding,—a list is taken of all the articles removed, and the owner upon receiving them back from the Council's man, checks them and signs a receipt. HOSPITAL ISOLATION. Two patients suffering from Scarlet Fever were admitted into the W'illesden Isolation Hospital, two from Small Pox into the Small Pox Hospital at Barnet. Six from Enteric Fever into the Acton Cottage Hospital. Seventeen patients were removed to the Stanmore Convalescent Home for Scarlet Fever at Stanmore. 15 The sum of £65 8s. was allowed during the year, to deserving poor persons, who through no fault of their own, were debarred from following their employment owing to having Infectious Disease in their homes. Probably never before has the want of an Isolation Hospital been more keenly felt than during the last year; and the distress caused thereby has been widespread regardless of the generosity of the District Council. In some cases I was obliged to use the expedient of removing children from the source of infection and boarding them out, and it is satisfactory that not a single individual thus removed developed the disease. SICK NURSING. The nurses in connection with our Cottage Hospital have had under treatment 293 patients, and paid 5,271 visits, an average of 18 visits to each patient. Nurse Dawkins has paid 3,090 visits; she has nursed 39 Scarlet Fever, one Diphtheria, and 19 Enteric Cases. She has given out 1,179 bottles of disinfectant, and taken 12 patients to Infectious Disease Hospitals. SCARLET FEVER. There were six deaths from Scarlet Fever, which, considering that 243 cases were notified during the year, is not a high rate. In 1893, there were 10 deaths and 111 notifications. We were not alone as regards the prevalence of this disease, as it was universal over the metropolitan area. There is no doubt that an individual who has suffered from Scarlet Fever, can convey the disease to others, long after apparent convalescence. Too much importance has been hitherto attached to the infectivity 16 of the skin during the latter weeks of Scarlatinal Convalescence. Dr. \V. J. Simpson who has made investigations at the request of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, found that only in 2.7 per cent. was there any reason to suspect desquamation of the skin as the cause of secondary infection, whereas 80 per cent. of the primary infective cases were connected with discharges from the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and that these discharges are probably the carriers of infection. The Medical Officer of Health should be notified as to the discharge of a patient from hospital, and printed instructions should be given to the parents, in order that suitable precautions can be taken in the home. SMALL POX. Two cases (a male and female) occurred in an old-fashioned ill-ventilated house in the town. The first patient, the female, contracted the disease in Town. She had never been vaccinated. The male sickened a few days afterwards, and had the disease mildly compared with the female; he was supposed to have been vaccinated when an infant. The patients were removed within an hour or so of the notification of the disease, to the Small Pox Hospital, at Barnet. Both recovered. The premises underwent thorough disinfection. DIPHTHERIA. Twenty-eight cases were notified against forty-nine in 1899. There were four deaths, against seven in the preceding year. The antitoxin for this disease is now used by nearly every practitioner in the district. I continue as before to keep a supply ready for immediate use from the Jenner Institute. It is most important to inject early, and not to wait till the disease assumes a severe form. It is said that it is impossible to give a fatal over-dose. 17 In mild cases 2,000 units should be injected, and this dose should be repeated in 24 hours, it the faucial condition gets worse and constitutional symptoms appear. In severe cases, and when the larynx is attacked, 4,000 to 10,000 units should be injected according to acuteness of constitutional symptoms. It is believed if any good is to be done by antitoxin in a bad case, it will be accomplished by 16,000 units given within 24 hours. TYPHOID FEVER. Twenty-nine cases were notified, against 46 in 1899, there were four deaths, against seven in the preceding year. Strict precautions regarding disinfection are carried out immediately a case is notified, with a view of destroying any Typhoid Bacilli deposited in closet pans or soil area around the closets. An outbreak of Typhoid occurred in some wooden huts in Old Oak Lane, which have been erected for the accommodation of the men employed on the new railway. I clearly proved that the disease was imported by a servant who had been sent home sick from Holloway. At my suggestion the contractors closed the huts, and submitted them and the soil area to a thorough process of disinfection under my supervision. As soon as a case of Enteric Fever is notified, Nurse Dawkins takes with her tabloids of Perchloride of Mercury. All the inmates in the house are told of the risks they run should they take their meals without first disinfecting their hands. By adding one tabloid to a pint of water, a solution is made of the strength of 1 in 1,000, and the hands should be steeped in this solution for at least five minutes. The following leaflet is also left:— 18 TYPHOID FEVER. HOW TO DISINFECT The Stools and Urine should be passed into a Solution of Chloride of Lime or Carbolic Acid (wine glassful of Carbolic to ¼ pint of Water). The Stool should be soaked in the above for at least 3 hours before being thrown away. Any solid lumps in the discharges should be broken up and well mixed with the Disinfecting solution : for which purpose two pieces of stick may be used, and the pieces should be burnt immediately after being used. It is necessary to soak infected linen in the Solution for at least 4 hours, since the Solution does not penetrate the whole of the linen for a considereble time. To Disinfect the Nurse's Hands.—The hands and spaces under nails must be thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water. Then the hands soaked in a Solution of Perchloride of Mercury (1 in 1000). Urinals must be treated in exactly the same way as bed pans, viz.: Immediately after use the bed pan should be covered and removed, one pint of Disinfecting Solution should be added to and well mixed with its contents before they are emptied down the closet. The bed pan should be finally washed with the Disinfecting Fluid. In the early part of the year a smoke testing machine, stoppers, etc., and a hand cart were purchased. These are in constant use, and the department is now equipped for testing drains and sanitary appliances. DRAINAGE. Sewers laid by the Council. Uxbridge Road about 271 yards.

The precipitation method of dealing with sewage is rapidly being replaced by the bacterial treatment, by nearly all large towns. The fallacies of our Ferrozone process are yearly becoming more apparent. We get a very indifferent effluent, and we find the difficulties of disposing of the sludge increasing. With the view of testing the new bacterial treatment, an experimental filter was started in the early part of the year. It consists of an open septic Tank, into which the sewage is turned without any preliminary treatment. This tank is aptly called the digesting or liquefying chamber. This liquefying process is brought about by the action of organisms that do not grow in the presence of air, and an effluent is produced which is practically without solids in suspension. The effluent from this septic tank is then uniformly distributed over the surface of coke or clinker, and passes out purified. This final purification is produced by organisms that grow in the presence of air, and also by the oxygen of the air. 20 As complaints were received of noxious smells in the neighbourhood of the Sewage Works I made frequent visits, and found by experiments that the smell arose from the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen, and that this gas was liberated owing to the force with which the effluent from the septic tank was sprayed on to the filter. To remedy the above defect, further experiments are being carried out, and so far with very satisfactory results. The effluent from the septic tank is forced by a pulsometer into a tank holding a day's supply, viz.: 250 gallons ; from this tank the effluent is delivered by gravitation on to a 6-in. tile, and from thence on to the surface of clinker. The effluent not being forced on to the filtering medium, no gases are disengaged. The following are the analyses of the two effluents, viz.: the precipitation process, and the bacterial treatment. The superiority of the latter is obvious, and I have no hesitation in advising the Council to adopt the bacterial treatment in place of the precipitation method ; the saving to Acton will be considerable, and we shall have no sludge to deal with.

WATER SUPPLY. I took samples of water from three different points during the year, viz.: top of Acton Hill, South Acton and East Acton. The samples were collected in specially prepared Winchester quarts and Sterile tubes, and submitted to a thorough chemical and Bacteriological examination with satisfactory results. Many of the ratepayers display extraordinary indifference as to the importance of the periodical cleansing of their water cisterns. I have repeatedly urged the importance of taking the drinking water from a draw off tap straight from the rising main. And once again I warn the ratepayers against using domestic filters containing charcoal, which gives off phospate of lime, and so forms food pabulum for microbes. I am aware that in many of the older houses the water cisterns are placed in a position that renders it very difficult to properly cleanse them, viz.: under the ceilings in the scullery, and where they are exposed to warmth and pollution. Whenever such cases come under my notice I endeavour to get this serious sanitary defect remedied. There are, I believe, few cisterns in the district now that have not properlyfitting covers. DWELLINGS. The district still continues to be built upon very rapidly. A large estate in the North of the Parish has lately been developed. Several other estates have been opened up. These are :— Acton Wells Estate, near Willesden. SoUthfield Park Estate, off Southfield Road. And Carlton Road Estate. 22 The Housing of the Working Classes is perhaps one of the greatest public health problems we have to face ; this matter is now engaging your earnest attention. No less than 679 houses were inspected by officers of the Council and myself during the year; and all buildings are now under the strict supervision of a competent building Inspector. PUBLIC BATHS. Public Baths will shortly be in evidence, and they are as necessary to every town or district as is a system of drainage. Our grand-children will look back with horror at the insanitary nineteenth century, in which, although lecturers were continually priding themselves on the advance in Sanitary Science, Local Authorities were not compelled to provide facilities for the furtherance of public health. THE MORTUARY. A new Mortuary has been built, situated at the rear of the Fire Station. It is lined with glazed bricks, well ventilated, fitted with three tables and every convenience. During the year 29 inquests were held, and 20 post mortem examinations performed. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. I personally made an inspection of several Laundries during the year. the following is the ANNUAL REPORT of MAURICE W. KINCH, Cert. San.

Systematic Inspection.—During the year there were 679 premises inspected, and 609 re-inspections of nuisances in course of abatement ; 298 visits were paid to infected houses, 178 rooms disinfected, also 17 closets where cases of Enteric Fever were notified, in addition to the ordinary inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops, Bakehouses, Slaughter Houses, Piggeries, and the Common Lodging House. Drainage Examinations.—The smoke test has been applied to 83 drains, and over 96 per cent, of them were found to be defective in some particular. Workshops.—Three Workshops with insufficient sanitary accommodation were provided with additional and efficient water closets. 28 Houses Closed.—One house, viz.: Swiss Cottage, in the Steyne, was closed by the owner without an Order having to be obtained. Notices.—Twenty-three Statutory Notices have been served for the abatement of nuisances, and the necessary work demanded was carried out without having to take proceedings before the Magistrates. Cowsheds, Dairies and Milk Shops.—In October Notice was given in the Local Paper requesting Cow-keepers, Dairymen, and Purveyors of Milk to be registered under the Dairies and Cowsheds Orders, 1885 and 1886. Sixty-five applied, 61 of which were registered, and the other 4 are bringing their premises up to the requirements of the Medical Officer of Health, and will be registered in due course. There are 6 Cowsheds, 21 Dairies, and 38 Purveyors of Milk, viz.: Register of Dairymen, Cowkeepers, and Purveyors of Milk.

Piggeries.—I beg to report that there are 10 piggeries in the district, as follows :— John Hotten. Ed. Frances James Pearce Thomas Bosher William Baggs James Bosher Geo. Morris Arthur Philips Geo. Morris J. Wm. Lawes Old Oak Lane, East Acton „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ „ 50, Hanbury Road 8, Enfield Road 112, Bollo Bridge Road 31 These have been visited 96 times, and were generally found to be in as cleanly a state as is possible under the conditions. Offensive Trades.—At Old Oak Lane, East Acton, the pig-keepers boil daily a considerable quantity of offal for the pigs. This at times is very offensive, but I do not think it can be classified as an offensive trade. Common Lodging House.—The common lodging house kept by Alice Rosina Gee, 20, Shaftesbury Road, has been inspected 11 times, and was always found to be satisfactory. Smoke Abatement.—Seventeen observations of Works' Chimneys were taken during the year. One of these chimneys gave considerable annoyance to occupiers in the immediate vicinity. The owner was written to on the matter, and the nuisance was considerably abated. Food and Drugs' Acts.—Samples for Analysis under the Food and Drugs' Acts are taken by Mr. W. Tyler, the Inspector, Brentford. No return as to the number of samples taken and the result of the analysis is supplied to the Council. During the year I seized :— 2 cases of oranges. 3 barrels of fish. 2 boxes of rabbits. which I took before a Justice and were duly condemned. MAURICE W. KINCH.
