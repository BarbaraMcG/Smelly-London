SOUG LIBRARY BOROUGH OF SOUTHGATE ANNUAL RETORT OF THE medical officer OF health FOR TH£ YEAR 1943 To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the BOROUGH of SOUTH GATE. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1943. The Report is again a very short one, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Health, but the record of the Council's Medical Services during the year is a good one, and the vital statistics generally again show an improvement on those for the previous year. The number of births occurring in the Borough for the first time passed the figure of 1,000, and at 1,088 gives a Birth Rate of 15.55, the highest rate since 192 0. The Death Rate of 12.2 is rather higher than that for 1942, but the Infantile Mortality Rate of 35 is appreciably lower than 36.7, the rate for 1942. The number of cases of infectious disease notified was high, due mostly to the prevalence of measles, but the infectious deaths were very few. The only changes in staff during the year were in the Sanitary Inspectors. Mr. L. Skeeles, the Senior Inspector was off duty on account of illness from the beginning of February until the end of the year. Mr. H. Hill was suspended from duty in April and resigned in November, and Mr. J. D. Dant commenced duty as an Inspector at the end of September. For five months the whole work of the Sanitary Inspectors had to be done by the remaining Inspector, Mr. A. E. Gooday, so far as it was possible for one man to cover all the ground. I would like to express my thanks to the Chairmen and Members of the Public Health and Maternity and Child Welfare committees for the support they have consistently given to the work of the Health Department, and to the members of the staff of the Department for their loyal -1- and willing co-operation throughout the. year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, M. MANSON. Acting Medical Officer of Health. Southgate Town Hall, N. 13. August, 1944. PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE at December 51st, 1945.
