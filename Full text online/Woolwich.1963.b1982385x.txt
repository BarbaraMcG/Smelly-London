AC 4372 WOO 63 II METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1963 BY T. STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1963 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health PREFACE To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting the 63rd Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Woolwich. The Report is on the general lines indicated by the Minister of Health. During the past decade there has been little movement in the population of the Borough, which was confirmed at the Census in 1961 at 146,603. The estimated population for the year 1963 was 148,690. A gradual rise in the Woolwich birth rate has taken place during the past seven years, the adjusted birth rate for 1963 being 15.6, compared with that- for the County of London of 20.0. Similarly, the local death rate has risen due to a rise in the year of 210 in the total deaths occurring. The adjusted death rate for 1963 was l3.0, compared with 11.4 for the year 1962. The previous excellent infant death rate for Woolwich, however, was not maintained, the rate increasing from 19.5 in 1962 to 28.9 in 1963. There were altogether 62 infant deaths, being the highest total 3ince 1951. The cause is not obviously apparent and too much weight must not be given to a single year especially when the total numbers involved are relativexy small. The greatest single cause of infant deaths, both locally and nationally, is now prematurity and research to lessen its incidence continues. Seventeen of the infant deaths resulted from prematurity, ten from pneumonia, 14 from congenital malformation, and the remainder from various other causes. The number of stillbirths registered was 38. However, only one maternal death was recorded. It is regretted that 27 Woolwich residents died from motor vehicle accidents, 13 of the fatalities involving pedestrians and including three boys and ten elderly people. A further 23 deaths were due to other accidents, 17 of these being home accidents. By intensive publicity, the Council is taking every opportunity to bring to the notice of the general public the dangers from home and road accidents. The year 1963 saw an appreciable extension in the work of the Health Department, particularly in the further services being made available for old people. The many and varied problems relating to their welfare calls for a good deal of co-operation with other health and welfare workers. The number of old people known to the Council's Visitors as needing the help of the health and welfare services now 2 totals over 5,000. Every effort is being made to increase the home services designed for their assistance. Two more 'meals on wheels' vehicles were brought into service during the year, and three new luncheon clubs were established. All meals are now being supplied by the Council's Catering Department from the central kitchen to the luncheon clubs and 'meals on wheels' service. The Council's incontinent laundry service was doubled. Two more full-time Welfare Visitors were appointed to meet the needs of the elderly. The Council's Old People's Welfare Committee had a busy year, and reports excellent support from the various voluntary agencies active in this work in the Borough. The Council's Smoke Control programme received added impetus during the year, with the bringing into operation on the 1st October, 1963 of the Eltham Smoke Control Area, in which there are some 5,500 premises, with a total acreage of 1,550. In addition, the preliminary work for the declaration of the Well Hall Smoke Control Area, comprising over 4,000 dwellings was completed; the operative date for this Area being October, 1964. The various tasks of the Public Health Inspectors concerned with the supervision of the local food supplies, infectious diseases, housing and other environmental health duties continued smoothly. Important new duties were given to the Inspectors for the implementation of the Offices, Shops, and Railway Premises Act, 1963. I am pleased to report that the Council's student training scheme for Public Health Inspectors continues to prove its value. With the appointment of a full-time Health Education and Home Safety Officer, who has been able to concentrate on this work, good results have been achieved. Details of the many local publicity measures taken during the year are contained in the Report. At the time of writing, plans for the reform of London Government which affect the work of the Health Department greatly are now well advanced. As we approach the Appointed Day for the transfer of all the County Council Health and Welfare Services, except the Ambulance Service, to the new London Borough of Greenwich, the opportunities which lie ahead for the Members and Officers of the new Borough in the field of Health and Welfare are apparent. The smooth implementation of all the local services will not be an easy one, but I am certain that it will be achieved speedily and effectively. It remains for me to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee and other Members of the Council and Chief Officers for their support and interest during the year. I would also like to pay a special tribute to the staff of the Department for their valuable work and support during another busy year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. STANDRNG. 3 HEALTH COMMITTEE at 31st December, 1963 THE WORSHIPFUL THE MAYOR (Councillor D.S. Ramsey, J.P.) Councillor G.E.

The ages of the victims ranged from 17-45 years. The remaining four deaths were caused by two youths being thrown off a motorcycle, a young lorry driver whose lorry ran off the road, and a middle-aged man who fell from his motor cycle under a heavy goods vehicle. OTHER ACCIDENTS Accidents other than road accidents accounted for 23 deaths, 11 less than in 1962. Seventeen of these accidents occurred in the home, and in 11 cases persons over 60 were the victims. Five elderly ladies died from falls at home, while one other and two elderly men died from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Two elderly women died from burns, and one elderly man from drowning when he collapsed in his bath.

Five others met their deaths from miscellaneous causes. 15 CENSUS 1961: COUNTY OF LONDON REPORT In March, 1963 the Registrar General issued the County of London Report giving information on the Census taken in April, 1961. The Report contains sections dealing with the distribution of population by age, sex, and wards of the Borough; marital conditions; nationality of residents; and housing conditions in the area. Since the last Census in 1951 a decrease of 147,472 in the population of the County area has taken place. The population of the Borough at the time of the Census was 146,603 (comprising 71,170 males and 75,433 females), compared with 147,891 at the 1951 Census, and 146,881 at the 1931 Census. The following Table gives details of the increases and decreases in the population by various wards of the Borough during the last ten years TABLE NO. 9 Wards Persons 1951 Persons 1961 Increase Decrease Persons per acre Abbey Wood 6,285 14,544 8/259 - 11.9 Avery Hill 5,428 5,096 - 332 9.9 Burrage 6,425 5,109 - 1,316 42.2 Central 7,527 6,621 - 906 50.9 Coldharbour 7,076 9,775 2,699 - 23.6 Eltham Green 5,542 5,297 - 245 31.5 Falconwood 2,753 5,868 3,115 - 13.0 Glyndon 6,076 4,383 - 1,693 47.6 Herbert 8,393 8,731 338 - 43.7 Horn Park 6,219 6,648 429 - 15.0 Middle Park 7,333 7.550 197 - 17.4 New Eltham 8,382 8,340 - 42 18.7 River 6.477 4,6l4 - 1,863 4.8 St. George's 8,425 5,844 - 2,581 15.9 St. Mary's 8,132 5,241 - 2,891 23.7 St. Margaret's 8,062 7,572 - 490 20.2 St. Nicholas 6,884 6,085 - 799 48.7 Sherard 6,152 5,684 - 468 28.0 Shooters Hill 5,970 5,290 - 680 9.8 Slade 7,144 7,005 - 139 25.8 Well Hall 5,478 4,834 - 644 32.7 Winns Common 7,728 6,492 - 1,236 15.1 16 The average number of persons per acre was 17.7 (compared with 17.9 in 1951), the 1961 figure being the lowest in the County area and closely followed by Greenwich with 22.1 persons per acre. The following Table gives a summary of the population of the Borough by age and sex. For comparative purposes the number of persons in 1951 is also shown. TABLE NO. 10 Age Group (Age last Birthday) Persons 1951 1961 Males Females Total No. of Persons 0-4 12,522 5,261 4,841 10,102 5-14 19,227 11,853 11,197 23,050 15-34 41,847 17,883 17,549 35,432 35-54 42,351 21,206 21,887 43,093 55-59 8,607 4,552 4,846 9,398 60-64 7,459 3,664 4,259 7,923 65 and over 15,878 6,751 10,834 17,585 There were thus 21,844 people of pensionable age (women over 60 and men over 65) at the time of the Census. The total population of the Borough over the age of 65 (17,605), compared with 15,828 at the 1951 Census. There were 3,254 women aged 60 and over living alone in the Borough, and 592 men aged 65 and over also living alone. There were 23,552 males and 22,108 females under the age of 21 years. The largest single yearly group in this age range related to those whose age on their last birthday at the time of the Census in April 1961 was 14 years. The birthplaces of persons in the Borough on the Census night are recorded as follows:- England 134,182; Wales 1,895; Scotland 2,162; Northern Ireland 696; Irish Republic 2,240; Canada 145; U.S.A. 56; India 1,026; Other European Countries 1,056; Malta 163; Australia 96; Gibraltar 68; Jamaica 111; Other Caribbean Countries 113; Cyprus 90; Pakistan 69; Nigeria 76; South Africa 124; Other African Countries 81. 17 The total number of private households in the Borough (i.e. comprising a person living alone, or a group of persons living together taking meals prepared together and benefiting from a common housekeeping) was recorded as 47,551, being 2,185 more than ten years ago. Altogether 45,001 structurally separate dwellings were occupied, being an increase of 5,04l since the last Census. Of the total population of 146,603, 143,804 (or 98 per cent.) were residing in private households, 888 were in hospitals, 292 in hotels, 167 in homes for the aged and disabled, 55 in places of detention, 27 in children's homes, 27 in educational establishments, 4ll in defence establishments, 440 in civilian ships, boats and barges, and 491 in miscellaneous communal establishments. Woolwich had a high percentage of wholly residential permanent buildings containing one dwelling (87 per cent, of total households), and also a high proportion of owner/occupiers (42 per cent, of total households). The Borough had almost the lowest percentage in the County of London of rented furnished accommodation. There were 45,549 structurally separate dwellings in the Borough containing a total of 47,098 household spaces; 20,932 were owner/ occupied; 13,464 were rented from the local authorities; 10,560 were rented unfurnished; 1,082 were held by virtue of employment; 775 were rented furnished; and 285 were rented together with business premises. Almost 40 per cent, of the total accommodation in the Borough consisted of five-roomed accommodation. At the time of the Census 548 dwellings were unoccupied. The density of occupation (persons per room) for the Borough was 0.68, compared with 0.73 at the 1951 Census, and is the lowest density in the County area. Twelve per cent, of Woolwich households are one-person households; 29 per cent, two-person households; 22 per cent, three-person households; and 19 per cent, four-person households. The percentage of Woolwich persons living at more than 1½ per room was 3.8, compared with 6.1 in 1951. This latest figure is the lowest percentage of any Borough in the County, the County average being 11.5 per cent. It is pleasing to report that the number of households in the Borough without a fixed bath has been substantially reduced in the last ten years and is now 9,727 (20 per cent.) compared with 15,534 at the time of the 1951 Census. A further 2,393 households (5 per cent.) compared with 4,119 ten years ago, were sharing a fixed bath with another household. 18 At 32,922 households (70 per cent. of households), all three amenities, i.e., piped hot water supply, water closet, and fixed bath, were available, and the occupiers had exclusive use of all three facilities. A total of 9,951 households (21 per cent.) were without a piped hot water supply, and a further 1,094 households (2 per cent.) were sharing this amenity. With regard to the provision of fixed baths, however, only eight Boroughs in the County area compared more favourably than Woolwich; on the provision of a piped hot water supply, in only two Boroughs was the standard higher. PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION OF THE AREA The Public Health Inspectors carried out 27,180 inspections, including reinspections, during 1963. The nature of the inspections is shown in Table 11. As a result of the inspections made, 775 Intimation Notices and 380 Statutory Notices were served.

Seven of the summonses were subsequently withdrawn, the necessary work having been completed prior to the Hearing. In two other cases the summonses were adjourned - one sine die as the repairs had been carried out, and the other case until the New Year as the owner concerned had entered hospital and was no longer capable of administering his own affairs. The Magistrate made Abatement Orders of 28 days in respect of two Nuisance Notices, and for contravention of a Byelaw Notice one landlord was fined £5 and the Council were awarded £10.10.0. costs. WATER SUPPLY Water supply for domestic purposes is supplied to the dwellinghouses in the Borough exclusively by the Metropolitan Water Board. 20 The water supplied in this Borough is not subject to plumbo-solvent action. Bacteriological, chemical and radio-activity tests of the water are carried out as a matter of routine by the Board and the results of these tests are regularly forwarded to the Council. No complaints were received during the year as to either quantity or quality from any of the occupiers of the estimated 45,529 dwellings in the Borough. In addition to water supplied to them by the Metropolitan Water Board, local industries take water for industrial and firefighting use from seven wells which are still in use in the area. Well water is also used at the Council's swimming baths at Woolwich and Plumstead. Samples of well water taken for bacteriological examination showed that the water was satisfactory. DRAINAGE Drainage defects found during the course of 1963 totalled 445, and the work of repair or reconstruction was supervised by the Public Health Inspectors. A total of 58 private or combined drains were tested with smoke, and of this number 22 were found to be defective. Of the defective drains two were subsequently discovered to be disused, and they were accordingly exposed and sealed off by the Health Department staff. Two of the 28 combined drains tested were found to be defective, and the necessary repairs were carried out by the responsible owners. PUBLIC BATHS AND SWIMMING POOLS Water used in the Council's swimming baths is continuously filtrated and chlorinated, and samples from paddling pools as well as the swimming baths are taken regularly for testing. Samples of water were submitted to the Southern Group Laboratory, Hither Green Hospital for bacteriological examination, and further samples of the water were tested by the Health Department staff for chlorine content and pH reaction. 21 The average result of the examinations and tests are shown belows-  Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 m.l.

In eleven instances it was necessary to serve formal Statutory Notices under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 before new dustbins were provided. WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS During 1963 the Public Health Inspectors made 424 inspections in response to requests by residents for assistance in ridding their premises of various insect pests. Thirty houses were disinfested of woodworm; one shop was disinfested of a heavy infestation of house flies; another house was disinfested of beetles and one infestation of cockroaches was cleared from a Council establishment. The practice of sprinkling powder containing 0.5 Dieldrin in the entrance of wasps nests as a method of destroying the wasps in the nest was continued, and a total of 29 nests were successfully destroyed in this way during the year. Charges made to the responsible persons for the work mentioned above totalled £170. 15. 1d. RAG FLOCK Routine inspections of three registered premises where filling materials are used and to which the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act applies were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. One licence to manufacture rag flock was renewed during the year. Four samples of rag flock submitted for analysis passed the prescribed standards of cleanliness. CINEMAS The Public Health Inspectors made regular inspections of the sanitary conveniences used by the public in the Cinemas and the one Theatre in the Borough. The standard of cleanliness found in the sanitary conveniences was good. 24 SHOPS ACT, 1950 The Shops Act, 1950 provides that the Borough Council is the authority for ensuring that temperature, ventilation and sanitary accommodation is suitably maintained in shop premises. The Council is also responsible for ensuring the suitability of washing facilities, lighting, and facilities for employees to take meals in the shop in which they are employed. A total of 233 Shops Act inspections were made by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. A total of 119 defects were remedied following the service of 29 informal Notices and nine formal Notices. NOISE ABATEMENT As a result of complaints of noise nuisance, the Public Health Inspectors made 47 inspections during the year. It was not found necessary to take formal action under the powers contained in the Noise Abatement Act or the Byelaws made by the Council to secure abatement of noise nuisances. A considerable number of the complaints investigated concerned noisy machinery. A Doctor, whose surgery adjoined a Launderette, complained of the noise and vibration from the washing machines when they were in use. The Public Health Inspector confirmed the existence of a noise nuisance and on inspecting the Launderette discovered that an electrical switch gear box fixed to the party wall was a major cause of the noise and vibration. He arranged with the Manager for a suitable baffle board to be inserted between the box and the wall and the vibration was thus eliminated. Uneven loading of the spin dryers was another source of unnecessary noise and vibration, and the Manager was also requested to ensure that the washing was evenly loaded into the machines before they were used. This he promised to do and no further complaint was received. Noise from a circulating pump operating a central heating system in an office block gave cause for complaint from nearby dwellers. A visit by the Public Health Inspector resulted in the pump being re-sited in a position where it would not cause a nuisance. Residents living near to a light engineering firm complained that their sleep was disturbed by hammering and running machinery that continued throughout the night. Following an interview with the Manager work involving hammering was promptly discontinued. 25 A resident annoyed by the constant revving of a neighbour's motor cycle complained to the Department. A simple request from the Public Health Inspector to the owner of the cycle to refrain from this practice was immediately agreed to. No further complaints were received. The noise from pumps used on works of excavation in preparation for the construction of a new swimming pool caused many residents living in the locality to complain. However, it was found that pumping was vital during the works of construction in order to keep the site dry. With the co-operation of the contractors the noise created by the pumps was effectively minimised by the erection of baffle screens over and around the pumping equipment, the works continuing without undue annoyance to neighbouring residents. Following a complaint of the use of chimes by an ice-cream salesman outside the hours permitted by the Noise Abatement Act, the firm concerned was warned that proceedings would be taken against it should a further infringement against the Act occur. The firm replied that the attention of their staff was repeatedly drawn to the requirements of the Noise Abatement Act, and instructions had been issued to their local Manager to warn the driver concerned. Other local firms were also warned of the use of the chimes outside of the permitted hours. Motor cyclists using a piece of ground as a race track also gave rise to a number of complaints from residents. The land so used however was outside the Borough. Accordingly, the attention of the Council concerned was drawn to the complaints received. Correspondence between that Council and the owners of the land resulted in the erection of warning notices. Since the notices were put up no further trespass has been reported. RODENT CONTROL During 1963, 1,233 premises were inspected following complaints of rats, and 401 premises visited following complaints of mice. The systematic inspection under the 'block control' scheme was continued in addition to the investigations carried out following complaints received. The total number of premises inspected during the year was 13»l65 and of that total 11,511 were inspected under the 'block control' scheme. 26 Charges are made for rodent control treatments carried out at all industrial and business premises; private dwellings are treated free of charge. Where defects of a structural nature are found to be causing or aggravating an infestation of rodents the owner is requested to remedy such defects. Twenty drains suspected of being defective were smoke tested by staff of the Department, and four drains were found to be defective. The defects found were remedied by the responsible owners. It was not found necessary to serve formal Notices under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 in order to secure abatement of the nuisances found. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer the use of the poison Sodium Fluroacetamide was continued in the sewers. The sewers were poison baited four times during the year and the results of the four treatments were very good. A reduction of 94 per cent. was recorded in the rat population in the sewers compared with the previous treatments when the poison used was Zinc Phosphide. HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS Persons carrying on the business of hairdresser or barber as well as the premises used for that purpose are required by Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 to register with the Council. Minimum standards to which both premises and equipment must conform are also laid down in Byelaws made by the Council. The Public Health Inspectors carry out inspections of hairdressers' and barbers' shops. There are 63 ladies' hairdressers; 46 gentlemen's hairdressers; and ten combined ladies' and gentlemen's hairdressers' shops registered by the Council. BETTING, GAMING AND LOTTERIES ACT, 1963 Under Part IV of the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act applications are considered by the Council from proprietors of cafes, restaurants and public houses for permits for the provision of amusements with prizes. Before considering the applications reports as to the suitability of the applicant's premises are made by the Health Department. Thirteen such premises were inspected and reported upon during 1963. 27 LICENSING ACT, 1961 - APPLICATIONS FOR CLUB REGISTRATION Before considering applications for Club registrations the local Magistrates forward copies of the applications to the Council for observations to be made to the Clerk of the Court. In order to ensure that the Club premises conform to the requirements of the Public Health and Food and Drugs Acts, the premises are inspected by the Public Health Inspectors. Reports were submitted to the Town Clerk in respect of 24 applications, twelve of which were applications for renewal of existing licences. PIGEON NUISANCE This Borough, in common with many other Boroughs both in London and the country generally, has shared in the increase in the number of pigeons that have appeared in recent years. Section 121 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 authorises the Council to take such steps as are considered necessary to prevent or minimise any nuisance, annoyance or damage caused by pigeons or house doves. At the beginning of the year a number of colonies of pigeons, varying in size from 20 - 120 birds, were noted, and except for two colonies nesting under two railway bridges, the majority of the colonies appeared suitable for trapping. Of the methods of destruction trapping was considered to be the best way of catching and destroying the pigeons. Specially designed traps were baited with suitable food, and the birds lured into the traps were destroyed. This method ensures that only wild pigeons are killed, other birds and homing pigeons finding their way into the traps being released. Two infestations of pigeons nesting in empty buildings were destroyed by the pigeon catcher entering the buildings after dark. Since March, when trapping was commenced, some 586 pigeons were caught and destroyed. This work was carried out by the Rodent Control staff. In dealing with the pigeons nesting under the railway bridges, it was considered essential to prevent the pigeons from perching under the bridges and fouling the footpath. Accordingly, 'Bird Baffle' - a pointed metal strip-was fitted to the underside of the bridges over the footpaths in order to prevent nuisance to pedestrians using the pavement under the bridges. The work of 28 fixing the 'Bird Baffle' was undertaken by British Railways. FLOODING IN HOUSES CAUSED BY BURST WATER PIPES One of the inevitable results of the extremely cold weather during the months of January and February was flooding in homes due to burst water pipes. Many residents who were without water due to freezing of the supply pipes had in some cases the greater problem of flooding to face when eventually the thaw restored the supply. The bursts normally occured in pipes situated in the roof space, causing saturation to bedding and soft furnishings in rooms, usually bedrooms immediately below. To assist residents in drying their belongings the equipment at the Disinfecting Station was made available to them, and during the cold weather the Department collected, dried and returned bedding, clothing, mattresses, carpets and other items of soft furnishings from 47 premises that had suffered severe flooding. Three neighbouring local authorities not possessing drying equipment of their own also sought assistance with the drying of bedding and carpets from flooded houses in their areas. Such assistance was gladly given and altogether eleven consignments of bedding, carpets, etc. were dried out for these local authorities. Collection to and delivery from the Disinfecting Station of the various articles was arranged by the Boroughs concerned. Charges to cover the labour involved and the plant used were made in respect of the work carried out for non-residents of the Borough. FOXES A number of complaints were received of foxes having been observed roaming on land and in gardens, driven, no doubt, by the abnormally cold winter of 1962/63. All such reports were investigated, and where foxes 'earths' were found these were treated with 'Cymag' gas. During the period under review seven 'earths' were discovered and treatment was undertaken by the Rodent Control staff. PHARMACY AND POISONS At the end of 1963, 136 names were entered in the Council's list of persons (other than Registered Pharmacists) entitled to sell Part II poisons. 29 Inspections of premises from which Part II poisons are sold are made regularly, and the licences are renewed annually. STREET CLEANSING There are over 161 miles of roads to be cleansed in the Borough, of which 11 per cent. are swept at least once daily; 8 per cent. three to six times weekly; and 8l per cent. twice weekly. Fifty-five street sweepers are employed on the work and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the main traffic routes in the Borough and the roads In the shopping areas of Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,770 street gullies are cleansed quarterly by mechanical gully cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review, 56,076 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor or carted to tip. The Council decided that, subject to the provision of tipping facilities at Stone, Kent, arrangements be made for the Plumstead Destructor to be closed on the 1st April, 1963. Prior to the final closing of the Destructor, some 260 tons of scrap metal, nine tons of waste paper and three tons of textiles were salvaged and sold, producing an income of £1,510. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES The water closets at all the Public Conveniences in the Borough are available without charge. Free washing facilities-For the past 12 years the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, Including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the public. Paid washing facilities, which include the supply of a linen towel, are also available. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse, and Public Conveniences, has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. 30 ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The Crematorium situated in the grounds adjoining Eltham Cemetery, is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich, and North-West Kent Joint Crematorium Committee, which comprises the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford, Erith, and Gravesend, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Crayford. The Crematorium was opened in August, 1956. The number of cremations taking place at this Crematorium during 1963 totalled 2,949 being 187 more than the previous year. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes Swimming Baths, Slipper Baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry, and in winter the Eltham Baths large swimming pool is converted for Public Hall use for social and sporting activities, and the Woolwich large pool for Indoor Bowling. The attendance figures for the Public Laundry during the past seven years are as follows:- 1962/63-24, 738; 1961/62- 26,124; 1960/61-24, 211; 1959/60-23,570; 1958/59-26,081; 1957/58-23,939; and 1956/57-18,295. Attendances for Slipper Baths in 1962/63 totalled 106,674 including the admission of 6,568 old age pensioners free of charge. The total attendance for all services for the year was 751,567, an increase of 17,536 over the year 1961/62 and a new Departmental record. Altogether 206,735 schoolchildren attended at the Baths in organised classes for swimming and swimming instruction, and 5,762 swimming lessons were provided for members of the public. The detailed attendances for the year ended 31st March, 1965 were as follows:- 31 Public Swimming 537,599 Swimming Tuition 5,762 School Swimming 206,735 Slipper Baths 100,106 Turkish Baths 11,763 Public Laundry-Hand washing 7,858 Machine washing 16,880 Swimming Club 35,661 Schoolchildren-Cricket School 457 Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners and Unemployed Persons 6,568 Spectators 16,791 Bowling Green (excluding Club reservations) 5,387 751,567 OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE EXPANSION OF WORK The year 1963 saw a rapid expansion in the Council's work for the elderly. As mentioned in my Report for 1962, the Council's newly established Old People's Welfare Committee is supported by two Sub-Committees consisting mainly of representatives of voluntary organisations working for the elderly. Within this framework it has been possible to establish the foundations of a comprehensive old people's welfare service. This rapid progress has only been possible through the enthusiasm of the many active workers in this field, both voluntary and statutory, and the interest of Members of the Council. There has been a widespread distribution of pre-paid business postcards by the Department to active workers in old people's welfare. These postcards are a useful means of notifying the old people's welfare staff of a need. Immediately on receipt of a postcard the elderly person is visited and any help found to be required is obtained. VISITING A rapid rise in the amount of visiting of elderly persons needing health and welfare help took place during the year. 32 The following are brief details of this work in the Borough:- Number on Register 1.1.63 3,433 Number removed from Register 537 Number of New Cases registered 2,218 Number on Register 31.12.63 5,114 Number of Home Visits made by Council's Visitors 15,387 Hospital visits 44 Number of Office interviews 781 Mobile Meals delivered during the year 23,809 Lunch Club meals served 33,849 LUNCHEON CLUBS In September three new lunch clubs were opened-at the Grovebury Hall on the Abbey Wood Estate; at the Council's Middle Park Social Centre (3 days a week); and at the St. Saviour's Church Hall, Middle Park Avenue (2 days a week). All the clubs are working satisfactorily, and are meeting a need in the respective areas. The Supervisors are assisted by a team of voluntary helpers at each club. Less active old people are taken to these clubs by special transport, with voluntary escorts in attendance. The two other clubs are at the Plumstead Baths and at the Progress Hall, Eltham. From the 1st January, 1963 all meals for the lunch clubs (other than The Victorians Club in Sherard Road, Eltham) were prepared at and delivered from the Council's central kitchen in Woolwich. The former responsibility of the London County Council for the meals subsidy in respect of all meals supplied in the Borough passed to the Borough Council during the year. In addition, the Borough Council is also responsible for the meals subsidy for lunches served at The Victorians Club. MOBILE MEALS During the year the mobile meals service was expanded to cater for the increased demand. Four vehicles are now operating on five days a week, meals being delivered by the Women's Voluntary Service helpers and by the Council's staff. 33 In view of the further increased demand, the Old People's Welfare Committee decided at the end of the year that two additional mobile meals vehicles should be purchased. RECREATION AND HOLIDAYS (a) Transport-Delivery was taken early in the year of the new Minibus specially designed to transport handicapped and less mobile old people. It is being used daily to convey handicapped and homebound old people to luncheon and other clubs, as well as to concerts, on regular afternoon outings during the summer months, and to special functions arranged by voluntary organisations. In view of the success of this work for the handicapped and homebound, and the need for more transport, the Old People's Welfare Committee are hoping to purchase a larger specially equipped vehicle. (b) Holiday Scheme-Under the Council's holiday scheme for old people 200 persons enjoyed a week's holiday at Westgate during the Spring or Autumn. Preference was again given to those who had not recently had a holiday and who could not otherwise afford a holiday. The great majority of applicants were either in receipt of National Assistance or would have been eligible for National Assistance if they made application. The cost of the holiday to the applicant, including full board and fare, was 40/-d., with a reduction in cases of hardship. Payment by the old people was often received by instalments. Voluntary escorts again assisted in this scheme. Many letters of thanks were received from the old people. (c) Special Services for Homebound-Following a most successful Christmas concert held at the Town Hall, which was attended by some 200 handicapped and elderly old people, the Old People's Welfare Committee, with the co-operation of the Amenities and Catering Committee, arranged two further concerts for handicapped and homebound old people. During the year the Old People's Welfare Committee considered the possible further use of community centres by lonely and less active old people for recreational activities, including the provision of luncheon clubs, and referred this question to a special Sub-Committee of the General Purposes Committee, which is considering the future provision of community centres. 34 INCONTINENT LAUNDRY SERVICE The Council provides a clean laundry service under its powers contained in the Public Health (London) Act, the work being carried out by the Health Department Disinfecting staff. The service was greatly expanded during the year with the provision of additional equipment to meet the increased demand for the service. Only applicants who cannot make other suitable arrangements for the laundering of their soiled linen are considered. Altogether 46,040 articles were laundered, compared with 30,947 in the previous year. The articles laundered were as follows:- Night attire 12,128; Sheets 7,826; Draw Sheets 7,021; Blankets 174; Pillow Cases 525; Table Cloths 281; Tea Cloths 387; Towels 1,062; Miscellaneous 15,636. TELEVISION AND WIRELESS FOR THE BEDRIDDEN Through the generosity of a private donor Woolwich, along with other Metropolitan Boroughs, was given the opportunity of recommending the names of needy old folk as being suitable for participating in a scheme for the provision of free television sets. So far more than 30 old people in the Borough have been provided with a free television set. The Department also acts as local sponsor to the Wireless for the Bedridden Society, who supply some 80 old people in this category in the Borough with free radio facilities. PUBLICITY With a view to informing the elderly and other sections of the community of the available services for the elderly, the Old People's Welfare Committee published a brochure giving details of the kinds of help available in the Borough. Some 10,000 copies of this brochure were distributed during the year to all actively engaged in this work, and to the old people on the Council's register. In addition, full local press publicity was obtained during the year of the Council's activities concerned with Old People's Welfare. 35 FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS APPEAL Under the slogan "Someone Cares", the Worshipful the Mayor, Councillor D.S. Ramsey, J.P., constituted another Festival of Christmas Committee this year with a view to co-ordinating and encouraging various voluntary bodies in the Borough to organise a number of efforts and projects and thereby raise funds for gifts for the aged at Christmas. Among the activities were the switching on of the lights in the main shopping area and the Christmas Tree lights; a Festival of Christmas Ball organised by Nalgo; Stage Coach tours of the Borough in which singers in Dickensian costume toured the area accompanied by Bell Ringers to collect funds for the Mayor's Appeal; carol services, and programmes of recorded carols during the lunch-time and for a short period in the evenings. A number of other fund raising efforts were also arranged. Members of the Council' staff again volunteered to deliver the Mayor's gifts to the old folk, and altogether made 1,800 calls to the old folk during the ten days before Christmas. The Appeal was again most successful and the amount collected was £2,355, of which approximately £1,800 was given to individual old folk in the Borough, the balance being used during the year to give help to old people when it was needed. GIFTS OF FUEL AND FOOD FOR NEEDY OLD PEOPLE During the cold spell at the beginning of the year, the Worshipful the Mayor, Councillor Mrs. M.E. Polley, J.P., authorised the purchase of 30 tons of coal and 3 tons of Sebrite to be delivered in small quantities to needy old folk who were found to be without fuel and who could not expect early delivery by their merchants. The names of the recipients, numbering over 400, were obtained from the Department's visiting staff, from the Chief Housing Officer, local clergymen and general medical practitioners, the W.V.S., the District Nursing Association, the National Assistance Board, and others. Through the generosity of the Mayor, gifts of food to several old people who were found to be short of food during the cold spell were arranged by the Department. VOLUNTARY WORK FOR THE ELDERLY The Old People's Welfare Committee are being supported by many voluntary helpers in this work. Over 100 voluntary visitors are now 36 regularly visiting lonely old people and reporting direct to the Organiser. Several local senior schoolgirls are active in this work. Among the many miscellaneous voluntary acts being undertaken in the Borough are car driving, radio repair work, home decorating, hairdressing, assistance with gardening, the delivery of logs and chopped wood, and help with shopping, washing and the preparation of meals. The New Eltham Townswomen's Guild kindly agreed to run the Old People's Welfare stall at the Mayor's Michaelmas Market and raised £30, which is being used for welfare purposes for the old people. SALE OF NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS At the end of the year the Old People's Welfare Committee gave approval to the commencement of a scheme for the distribution of nutritional food supplements to old people living in the Borough. Under this scheme supplementary foods such as Horlicks, Ovaltine and Marmite will be supplied to old people at "welfare prices". HOUSING REPAIRS The number of occupied dwellinghouses in the Borough at the end of the year was estimated as 45,529. Premises inspected for defects during the year under the Public Health and Housing Acts, totalled 2,258. Of the premises inspected 825 were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 548 houses were made fit or repaired by informal action. The number of Intimation Notices served during the year was 742. In 277 cases it was found necessary to serve Statutory Notices in order to ensure that the necessary repairs were carried out. OVERCROWDING On complaints of unsatisfactory housing conditions or overcrowding, or in the course of routine inspections, 111 families 37 were visited. Six families were found to be living in accommodation that was statutorily overcrowded and reports in respect of these families were submitted to the Chief Housing Officer. Requests for a statement of the permitted number of persons at a dwelling as provided by the Housing Act were received concerning 384 dwellings. The necessary information was supplied to the landlords. SLUM CIEARANCE AREAS The following Borough Council Clearance Areas were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year. Area Date of Confirmation Earl Rise No. 1 Area: Nos: 4l-45(incl.) Walmer Terrace. 30th May, 1963 Earl Rise No. 2 Area: Nos: l-17(odd); 21-27(odd); 9th July, 1963 31-4l(odd); 45 and 47; 12, 16-22(even); 34-52(even); and 56-60(even) Earl Rise. Nos: 47-50(incl.); 52-54(incl.) and 56-66(incl.) Walmer Terrace. Nos: 6-40(even); and 44-56(even) Elmley Street. Nos: ll-4l(odd) Glyndon Road. Both these Areas, together with added land, constitute part of the Council's Glyndon Redevelopment Area. They are in an area zoned for residential purposes. I also represented the following Clearance Areas, which comprise part of the Council's Glyndon Redevelopment Area:- Elmley Street No. 1 Area: (comprising 42 houses) Nos: 3-9(odd), and 13-31(odd) Elmley Street; 1, 3, 29, 31, 2-12(even), and l6-30(even) Southport Road; and 67-76(cons.) Walmer. Terrace. Elmley Street No. 2 Area: (comprising 4 houses) Nos: 43-49(odd) Elmley Street. Elmley Street No. 3 Area: (comprising 9 houses) Nos: 45-61(odd) Glyndon Road. 38 These houses, which were occupied by 62 families, comprising 165 persons, are between 80 and 100 years old, and are in general disrepair. Most of them are affected by rising and penetrating dampness, have inadequate lighting and ventilation, sagged roofs, and bulged and fractured walls. During 1963 I represented that the properties l-28(cons.) Fennell Street were unfit for human habitation and should be considered for slum clearance by the Council. I also represented that the properties l-4(cons.) Taylor's Buildings, Spray Street, were unfit for human habitation, and the Council made a Clearance Order in respect of these houses. INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation, and Demolition and Closing Orders were made by the Council as follows:- Demolition Order-1 Saunders Road. Closing Orders-39 Woolwich Common. 56 Vicarage Road. 154 Plumstead Road. 208 Maxey Road (Basement front and back rooms). 32 Herbert Road (Basement front and middle rooms). 202 Maxey Road (Basement back room). On the satisfactory completion of work to make the accommodation fit, the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of:- 25 Cantwell Road, 26 Wilmount Street (part), 29 Majendie Road (part), and 11 Saunders Road (part). IMPROVEMENT GRANTS The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959 provides that owners, and in some cases leaseholders, of dwellings may receive from the local authority a grant of money towards the cost of modernising their properties. Two schemes are available to a landlord under which he can claim a grant. The 'Standard' grant can be claimed in respect of houses erected prior to 1945. The 'Standard' grant is towards the cost of the installation of the five following amenities 39 1. Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom. 2. Wash-hand basin. 3. Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling. 4. Hot water supply. 5. Facilities for storing food. A 'Standard' grant can provide half the cost of the work involved up to a maximum of £155. The second form of grant available to an applicant is the 'Discretionary' grant. This form of grant is subject to a minimum of £50 and a maximum of £400, and is paid towards the cost of converting a dwelling to conform with a 12-point standard. Applications for either 'Standard' or 'Discretionary' grants are made to the Borough Treasurer, and are passed to the Health Department for an inspection of the premises to determine that the proposals satisfy the standards specified by the Act. During the year the Public Health Inspectors inspected 162 premises in respect of applications for 'Discretionary' grants, 20 in respect of 'Standard' grants, and an additional 85 visits were made to advise owners or builders on enquiry regarding Improvement Grants. RENT ACT, 1957-CERTIFICATES OF DISREPAIR The following applications for various Certificates under the provisions of the Rent Act were dealt with during the year:- 1. Applications for Certificates of Disrepair 16 2. Notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 10 3. Certificates of Disrepair issued 4 4. Undertakings received from landlords, and accepted by the Council 4 5. Works completed after issue of Notices to landlords of the Council's intention to issue a Certificate of Disrepair 1 6. Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair 7 7. Certificates of Disrepair cancelled without objections 5 40 8. Applications for Cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused 2 9.

Applications from tenants for Certificates as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 3 12. Certificates issued to tenants as to the remedying of defects for which the landlord had previously given an undertaking 3 HOUSING PROGRESS The number of dwellings built in the Borough during the year was as under:- By the Borough Council 318 "the London County Council 359 "Private Enterprise 319 996 In addition, the Borough Council had a further 633 dwellings under construction. The provision of new housing accommodation by the Council continued throughout the year by means of the further redevelopment of temporary dwelling sites, and in Redevelopment Areas. At the end of December, 1963 there were 10,336 tenancies owned or controlled by the Council. In the St. Mary's Redevelopment Area, 35 dwellings and a Doctor's Surgery were completed and occupied at the Junction of Woolwich Church Street, and the completion of this scheme has allowed the widening of Woolwich Church Street to be commenced. Work also began on a further scheme totalling 119 dwellings, many of which should be available for letting during 1964. The first stage of the redevelopment in the Glyndon Area, comprising 252 dwellings has proceeded satisfactorily, and at the 41 end of the year 170 dwellings were completed and occupied. This scheme includes three 11-storey blocks of flats where space heating is by gas warm air. Laundry facilities and garages have been provided. Eight shops were included in this scheme, and it is hoped that the facilities provided will meet the day-to-day needs of the tenants in the area. Work also commenced on the second stage which, when completed, will comprise 179 dwellings in four and five-storey blocks. A Doctor's Surgery and house is also included. The families who will occupy the majority of these properties will be transferred from the fourth stage of the Redevelopment Area. Initial consideration has also been given to the redevelopment of the Woolwich Common area, where it is proposed to clear the older houses and erect approximately 1,000 new dwellings. The provisional scheme considered by the Council includes shops, a Community Centre, a Doctor's Surgery, and a Nursery School. Schemes are in progress on several other sites throughout the Borough. In the Bostall area 64 dwellings are under construction, replacing certain temporary dwellings which stood on the sites, and 72 flats and maisonettes are being erected in the Kirkham Street Redevelopment Scheme. At Gossage Road a 5-storey block of flats was erected, on a site formerly occupied by old properties. In Eltham, the Well Hall Road scheme comprising 100 dwellings has progressed satisfactorily, many of the houses being occupied at the end of the year. The second stage of the scheme-45 onebedroomed flats in a tower block-will be completed during 1964. During the year 57 families were rehoused from temporary dwellings, helping to make additional land available for permanent development. At the 31st December, 1963 there were 3,161 applicants on the Housing Register, compared with 2,978 the previous year. The above information on the housing progress in the Borough has been kindly supplied by the Chief Housing Officer. HEALTH EDUCATION Modern health education has progressed beyond the mere imparting of information on what health services are available. By example, exhortation and training it now seeks to encourage even those who are "healthy" to make the fullest use of their physical and mental well-being 42 and to maintain it by the avoidance of detrimental habits. A climate of opinion in which smoking, obesity, or poor dental hygiene is regarded with the same distaste as lack of cleanliness in person and clothing can only be achieved by constant pressure at all levels, from national programmes to local campaigns and the day-to-day contact by public health workers. This Council has for many years been active in publicising information and advice on the promotion and maintenance of health. Beginnings were made well before the last War. Since that time a service has been progressively built up which has developed along with the changing basis of health education. Film shows; talks, sometimes illustrated either by films or by other visual aids; training schemes and displays, have become extremely popular with local organisations ranging from youth clubs to pensioners meetings. Publicity, advice and assistance in home accident and atmospheric pollution prevention, instituted by the Council when both these problems first came to notice, have grown in impact and emphasis over the years. Permanent poster displays and the issue of leaflets have formed a continuous means of background publicity to the general public. FILM SHOWS AND TALKS The year 1963 saw much interest and participation in this service. Recovery from a wane in popularity due, it is believed, to the initial impact of television has now been completed and has even exceeded the pre-television demand. The total of 136 visits denotes an increase of 17 visits (or 14 per cent.) over the previous year. Average audience figures remain approximately the same as in previous years, varying individually from small groups to large numbers in old people's and youth clubs. Talks, and talks with films, continue to show a rise in popularity, but, as can be seen from the Tables below, the film show still possesses the greater attraction. Several organisations were visited for the first time and revisits were often requested upon the realisation of the diversity of the subject of public health. A number of letters of appreciation were received following visits by the health education unit. The general format of programmes followed established patterns. Where a talk alone is given the programme lasts about 30 minutes, with time for questions. When films are included with the talk, 43 or films alone are shown, the programme is designed to last approximately 60 minutes. All equipment, projectionists, speakers and transport are provided by the Department, which is fortunate in having a number of the staff willing to give their time to explaining aspects of health and welfare work with which they are concerned.

In addition, the Department's own poster sites were supplemented by the hiring of a site at each of the nine local railway stations. The monthly edition of "Better Health" is distributed to doctors' waiting rooms, and to factory and workshop canteens and rest rooms. In 1963 this distribution was augmented to include dentists' waiting rooms. Large quantities of other leaflets on health and home safety matters are included in this distribution. FOULING BY DOGS - WARMING NOTICES The demand for display of these notices continued throughout 1963. The nuisance caused by owners of dogs in not training their pets properly or not exercising proper control appears fairly general. However, the display of a notice warning of the penalty involved does reduce the incidence in a particular area. Since it is felt that a permanently erected notice loses its impact, it is the practice to remove the notices at regular intervals to different areas of the Borough. CLEAN AIR The Council is pursuing a vigorous policy of smoke control over the area of the Borough. Much publicity is required in order to keep residents affected aware of the progress in bringing new Areas into operation. In addition, a Public Meeting is held following the confirmation of a Smoke Control Order, and static and mobile demonstrations of approved appliances and fuel, with a full information and advice service arranged. A large selection of leaflets is made available. Further details are given on page 57. SMOKING AND HEALTH Local publicity is carried out aimed at reducing the incidence of smoking, and its consequent contribution to lung cancer and bronchitis. Posters issued by the Ministry of Health are regularly displayed throughout the Borough, and leaflets distributed to local general practitioners, dentists, factories and 45 workshops. On five occasions, mainly to youth organisations, smoking and health was made the main theme of the health education programme. FOOD HYGIENE CAMPAIGN During the summer months an intensive food hygiene campaign was arranged, making use of the posters and poster strips issued by the Ministry of Health. These were distributed to all known «afes. restaurants, public houses, butchers, grocers, ice-cream and milk vendors, and fish and chip shops in the Borough. The proprietors of these establishments were asked to display posters where they would be seen by food handlers. Arrangements were also made for the supply and printing of small plastic covered notices drawing attention to the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations relating to smoking whilst handling "open" food. VENEREAL DISEASE With the assistance of the Borough Engineer, permanent notioes were erected in all public conveniences in the Borough drawing attention to facilities for free and confidential treatment of this disease. A number of requests were received from leaders of local youth organisations for leaflets on this problem. SAFETY IN THE HOME The Home Safety Committee, appointed in 1962, considerably expanded its activities in 1963. In spite of national and local publicity the extent and gravity of this problem is only gradually being realised by the general public. Part of the reason for this lack of appreciation is the fact that most home accidents have no "news" value and therefore do not generally attract the same press, radio and television coverage as the more dramatic road, travel and industrial accidents. It is hoped that the cumulative result of the activities of the Home Safety Committee of this Council, and of those throughout the country, particularly in training parents of the future, will result in a substantial reduction in the toll of death and suffering. 46 In Woolwich during 1963, as mentioned earlier, 17 persons died as a result of an accident at home. Five of these deaths occurred from falls, and four from poisoning. A further seven died from burns and one from drowning. Figures for non-fatal accidents are not readily available since many people either treat themselves or are treated by their own General Practitioner, and still others report to hospital either by their own transport or public transport. It is known, however, that injuries sufficiently serious to require the use of an ambulance were sustained in 474 cases during the year. i) Film Shows and Talks On 50 occasions, Safety in the Home was made the subject of programmes given by the Health Education Unit. The talks were well received and often surprise was expressed at the gravity of the problem. On 23 other visits by the Unit a short Home Safety film was included in programmes covering another aspect of Public Health. ii) Leaflets and Literature Much use is made of the existing facilities for distribution of leaflets to local doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms, factory and workshop canteens and rest rooms. Much literature is also distributed during visits made by the Health Education Unit. A new departure was made in the inclusion of leaflets dealing with the safe use of solid fuel, electricity and gas, in letters to residents of new and current smoke control areas. Posters are displayed on the Department's transport, at Council offices and libraries, and at nine sites at each of the railway stations. iii) Visiting Advice on Home Safety is given by the Old People's Welfare Visitors and Public Health Inspectors on their routine visits. A new scheme was inaugurated with the consent of the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee for the issue to home accident patients attending hospital, of a reply-paid card offering the assistance of the Committee in preventing any future accidents. This scheme, first started in this Borough, has received much interest by other authorities, a number of whom have started up their own schemes. iv) Home Safety Training (a) Local Department Stores - An offer was made to the larger department stores for the inclusion of Home Safety in their staff 47 training schemes. One acceptance was received, and a three-week course was given to selected staff, the emphasis being to encourage sales staff to bear safety in mind when advising customers on purchases. (b) Local Youth Organisations - A similar offer of Home Safety training courses was made to leaders of local youth organisations. In all, throughout the year, nine courses were given and there is evidence that the interest in these courses will continue. Some of the courses were in preparation for the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme, and safety badges. (c) Local Schools-With the assistance of the Divisional Education Officer an offer similar to the one made to youth organisations was made to local secondary schools. Two illustrated lectures were given following morning assembly to 400 elder boys and were well received. (d) Local Day Hospital-An interesting experiment was commenced where a comprehensive course, including Home Safety and some Public Health information, is given to short-stay patients at the local Day Hospital. It is believed that this is proving of benefit to these patients, and it is expected that the courses will continue. v) Displays (a) Local Department Stores-An exhibition provided by the Department-at one of the large stores drew attention to the need for care in the home. Some of the exhibits were lighted and animated, and attracted considerable interest. (b) Local Organisations-An offer was made to local organisations for the inclusion of a Home Safety display, provided by the Council, in any public function such as a bazaar or fete that the organisation concerned might be considering. The response was good, with the result that 22 displays were arranged in all parts of the Borough. (c) Improvement Grant Exhibition-Liffler Road-Through the courtesy of the Borough Treasurer space was made available for a Home Safety display in an exhibition house designed to show the advantages accrueing from the benefit of an improvement grant. This exhibition was extremely successful and attracted large numbers of visitors. vi) Campaigns Under the general heading of "Safety begins at Home" the two main national campaigns were devoted to "Home Safety Training" and "Buy for Safety". 48 Full participation was made in both of these campaigns. Copies of the "Buy for Safety" leaflet were circulated to local organisations and the "Sell for Safety" leaflet to local businesses. Local campaigns were initiated, the two major ones being (a) the canvassing of local pharmaceutical establishments as to the inclusion of leaflets on accidental poisoning with medicines and tablets issued on prescription, and (b) posters recommending the use of fireguards sent to all local fuel merchants and ironmongers with the request that they be prominently displayed. A simple Home Safety leaflet was devised drawing attention to everyday causes of home accidents, together with suggestions for simple remedies. 20,000 copies of the leaflet were printed and distributed. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES AT WHICH FOOD IS OFFERED OR PREPARED FOR SALE A total of 1,078 inspections of food premises, other than the daily market inspections, was carried out by the Food Inspectors during the year. Inspections of registered food premises were as follows:- Visits to Dairies 9; Distributors of Milk 78; Ice-cream Premises 167; Premises where Meat is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved 166; Premises where Sausages are Manufactured 72; Premises where Fish is Cured or prepared for Frying 24; Wholesale dealers in Margarine 3; Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 191; Industrial and School Meals Service Canteens 46; Bakehouses 11; Itinerant Vendors 5? Non-Registered Premises 158; Greengrocery and Fish Shops 70; Public Houses 78. FOOD SAMPLING, 1965 During the year ended 31st December, 1963, 732 samples of food and drugs (being 603 informal and 129 formal samples) were submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst. Of these, 15 informal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, givi.ig a percentage of 2.0 compared with 2.5 in 1962. No private samples were examined during the year. -49- Details are as followst:— TABLE NO. 14 Sample No. Article Adulteration or Irregularity. 786 Desiccated Coconut Contained sulphur dioxide 60 parts per million, contrary to Preservatives Regulations. 688 Aspic Jelly Powder Contained sulphur dioxide 150 parts per million, not disclosed on label. 724 Canned Casserole Steak Contained 60 per cent. meat.

MIIK SUPPLY There were 165 registered Distributors of Milk in the Borough at the end of 1963* A Dealer's Pasteuriser's Licence and a Dealer's Steriliser's Licence were in force in respect of the one Dairy. In respect of Distributors of Milk, the following licences, issued under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, i960 were in force - 53 Pre-packed Milk licences to use the Special Designation "Sterilised" 15 "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised" 65 "Sterilised", "Pasteurised" and "Tuberculin Tested", Six licences were issued in respect of milk sold from vending machines. Routine inspection of premises used for the distribution of milk were regularly carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. No formal Notices had to be served to secure compliance with requests made to remedy defects found. The percentages of fat content of milk samples submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis were as followst- No. of Samples 4.5 per cent, and over 3 4 per cent, and under 4.5 per cent. 7 3.5 per cent, and under 4 per cent. 74 5 per cent, and under 3«5 per cent. 45 Below 3 per cent. Nil -51- The ten samples containing 4 per cent. of fat and over were of Channel Island milk. No Channel Island milk samples contained less than 4 per cent. of fat. To assess the keeping quality of the milk 153 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for the Methylene Blue test. All the samples submitted passed the prescribed test. A similar number of samples of Pasteurised milk or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were tested at the Park Hospital Laboratory and all the samples satisfactorily passed the Phosphatase test, which determines the adequacy of pasteurisation. Satisfactory reports were received from the Park Hospital Laboratory in respect of 22 samples of Sterilised milk or Tuberculin Tested Sterilised milk subjected to the Turbidity test. The above tests are contained in the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. During the course of delivery to schools, hospitals, and Institutions, 13 samples of milk were taken for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and a similar number were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests. ICE-CREAM There were by the end of the year, 331 registered ice-cream premises in the Borough, of which four are used for the manufacture of ice-cream, and four for the storage of ice-cream. Of the remainder, the great majority sell only pre-packed Ice-cream. The premises from which ice-cream is sold are inspected regularly by the Public Health Inspectors, and during the year six defects which were found were remedied following the service of informal notices. The premises of each applicant for registration for the sale of ice-cream are inspected in the first instance to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations. A copy of the Heat Treatment Regulations is supplied to the applicant. In the course of the year 34 samples of ice-cream were tested at the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for grading by the Methylene Blue test. All the samples examined were satisfactory. -52- PUBLIC HOUSES To ensure that the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations are observed regular inspections of the 132 licensed public houses in the Borough are carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. Of the 132 public houses in the area, 25 serve main meals. The standard of hygiene in the public houses was on the whole excellent,, and it was necessary on only two occasions to serve informal notices to remedy defects found. UNSOUND FOOD The number of items of foodstuffs inspected and certified as unfit for human consumption during the year was 37,l8l and weighed approximately 59 tons. Of the total weight of unsound food examined, some 47 tons were of offal and meat condemned at the local Abattoir. FOOD COMPLAINTS The Public Health Inspectors investigated 37 food complaints received in the Department during the year. Foreign bodies in foodstuffs were a major cause of complaint and altogether 16 complaints of this nature were dealt with. Investigation into a complaint of a foreign body in a loaf of bread revealed that the foreign substance was mouse dirt. The Bakery was inspected; the premises were in a clean and orderly condition and no evidence of mice infestation was found. The Health Committee decided to send a warning letter to the Baker concerned. Other foreign bodies were reported to have been found in bread (5 cases), in a bottle of lemon squash; in a bottle of milk - which apparently resulted from the capping machine fixing two caps to the bottle, one of which distorted and fell into the milk. Foreign bodies were also reported in a packet of cornflakes; in a bag of flour; in a tin of corned beef; and in a tin of plums. The attention of the responsible manufacturers was drawn to the complaints. The complainants were advised of the action taken, and generally a call was also made to the complainant by the firm concerned. -53- Complaints of mould growth related to a Jam roll, a meat pie, sponge cakes, a cornish pasty, bread rolls, and pork luncheon meat. The retailers selling this food were visited and their premises and stock examined. Where necessary stale stock was withdrawn from sale and destroyed. Other complaints dealt with included alleged unfit meat, cheese, corned beef, sausage rolls, blackcurrant tarts, and steak (thought by complainant (incorrectly) to be cats meat). It was found during the investigations that both manufacturers and retailers of foodstuffs were as anxious as the Pood Inspectors to see that all steps possible were taken to ensure that similar oomplaints did not occur in future. MEAT INSPECTION An event of national and historic importance in the field of meat inspection took place on the 1st October, when for the very first time in this country it became a statutory requirement for local authorities to inspect all carcase meat intended for human consumption during the course of slaughter. By the introduction of the new Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963 it is hoped to obtain throughout the country 100 per cent, inspection of all animals presented for slaughter for human consumption. It has long been the practice at Woolwich to carry out 100 per cent. Inspection of all food animals presented for slaughter and for this purpose there are four Public Health Inspectors always available for regular meat inspection duties. Should the occasion arise through holidays or sickness other Inspectors are seconded temporarily to maintain this service. When carcases have been inspected and passed as fit for human consumption they must be marked with a stamp identifying the local authority and the Officer by whom the inspection was carried out. The marking of all carcases passed fit for human consumption appears at first sight to be a very small exercise in the process of completing the inspection, but cumulatively the time taken up by this additional operation during the course of a day In a busy slaughterhouse similar to the one at Woolwich is considerable. It has been found in practice that if the local authority's mark is to be legible it is best to delay marking the carcases until they are nearly but not quite dry. -54- Provision is made in the Regulations for local authorities to make a charge for the inspection within the scale of charges prescribed by the Regulations. The permitted charge should not exceed 2/6d. per horse or bovine animal, 9d. per calf or pig, and 6d. per sheep, lamb or goat. The Council decided to charge the maximum rates having regard to the cost of meat inspection to the Council. The downward trend of the incidence of Tuberculosis in cattle, calves, and pigs has been maintained during 1963. For the second year in succession no whole carcases of beef, veal, or pork were condemned for this disease. There were, however, 48 whole carcases of veal, lamb and pork condemned for other reasons which rendered the meat unfit for human consumption. Pneumonia in pigs and parasitic infestations of various kinds, particularly liver fluke in cattle and oscarides in pigs, were responsible for large amounts of offal being condemned. More than 2,000 bovine livers were condemned for liver fluke infestation during the year. Arthritis in pigs is also still very prevalent, and many joints have to be condemned because of this condition. There was a noticeable decline in the number of cases of Cysticercosis identified in cattle during the year, being nearly a third less than the previous year, when fewer cattle were slaughtered. The export of pig carcase meat from the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society's slaughterhouse at Garland Road, Plumstead, was the main trading feature of the year. Between June and December a thousand hogs and sows, representing a hundred tons of carcase meat, were slaughtered for export to France. Legs of pork from selected hogs were also the subject of export to the European Continent. All carcase meat slaughtered for export to the European Continent (except for Belgium) must be inspected by a Veterinary Surgeon specially delegated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for this purpose. I am happy to report that the most cordial relations are maintained between the Council's Public Health Inspectors and the Ministry's Veterinary Surgeons. The total number of animals slaughtered and inspected during the year at the Garland Road slaughterhouse was 64,171. Details are as follows:- -55- TABLE NO. 15 CARCASES & OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART, 1963 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed and inspected. 11,702 37 1,330 12,151 38,951 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci)- Whole carcases condemned - - 10 1 37 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 3,637 3 14 833 12,609 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis and Cysticerci 31.0 8.1 1.0 6.8 32.3 Tuberculosis only- Whole carcases condemned - - — — — Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 33 2 — — 277 Percentage of the number inspected affected with Tuberculosis .28 3.3 — — .7 Cysticercosis - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 48 — — — — -56- CLEAN AIR SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Good progress was made in 1963 towards bringing the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control. During the year a further large Smoke Control Area was declared, and at the end of 1963 there were 19 Areas in operation. The following Areas, details of which have been previously reported, are now in operation:- St. Mary's Clothworker's Wood St. Mary's No.2 Coldharbour St. Mary's No.3 New Eltham St. Mary's No.4 Garrison North Abbey Wood Glyndon Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Glyndon No.2 Abbey Wood No.2 Horn Park Abbey Wood No.3 Rockmount Middle Park (North East) Eltham. Middle Park (South West) The total acreage of these Areas is 4,443 acres, with over 25,000 dwellings subject to Smoke Control. With the addition of the Well Hall Smoke Control Area, which was declared during the year, and of which details are set out below, over 29,000 dwellings are within Smoke Control Areas. This represents over three-fifths of the premises in the Borough. With the exception of the Council's Page Estate, the whole of the Borough south of Shooters Hill is now subject to Smoke Control. Details of the individual Areas are set out in Table No. 16 and the accompanying map. The following Area was declared during the year:- Well Hall This is a large Area of predominantly private property. It comprises 540 acres and 4,136 dwellings. Of the total number of properties, 19 are Borough Council permanent dwellings; 12 are London County Council permanent dwellings; 27 are Crown properties; and the remainder are privately owned. In the majority of the Borough Council and London County Council premises no works of conversion are necessary. -57- Included in this Area are 104 shops, offices or other nondomestic buildings. It is estimated that some 3,000 dwellings will require 4,800 approved appliances, and a further 500 will require means of ignition to the existing approved appliances. The operative date is 1st October, 1964. NEW AREAS During 1963 preliminary work was commenced upon two further Areas. The first of these is a large area of private property immediately to the north of the Well Hall Area. The second Area coincides with the phasing of one of the Council's Redevelopment Areas. The Council's target date for the whole of the Borough to become smokeless is 1968. At the present rate of progress this should be achieved. PAYMENT OF GRANT One of the main difficulties associated with the payment of grant upon the conversion of fires continued to be the inability of the Council to give financial assistance where the work was carried out without prior written approval, or carried out before the Smoke Control Order had been confirmed by the Minister. The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee made unsuccessful representations to the Minister in 1959 and 1961 that the law in this respect should be amended. Further representations were made during the year that where the work is carried out under the supervision of a local authority, grant should be payable towards the cost if and when a Smoke Control Order is confirmed. SMOKE CONTROL PROGRAMMES Early in the year the Minister circularised local authorities on their progress in Smoke Control in the "black areas". The Minister reported that although a number of authorities expect to complete their programmes earlier than was originally estimated, there remained nearly 40 authorities who expected to take 15 years or more. In the Minister's view many authorities would need to get along more quickly than they have in the past. As previously mentioned, Woolwich is ahead of schedule and the whole Borough should be smokeless by 1968. -58- HARDSHIP CASES The Clean Air Act gives the Council discretion to pay more than 7/l0ths grant where it considers this to be reasonable to cover cases of financial hardship. The Council decided to pay the whole cost of reasonable works of conversion in the case of applications from owner/occupiers who are retirement pensioners and who are also receiving National Assistance, and nine such payments were made during the year. In addition, seven payments were made in respect of retirement pensioners who, although eligible for National Assistance, had not applied for it. Two special cases were considered. The applicants were approaching pensionable age. One was a widow of 59 in straightened circumstances, and the second was a resident aged 6l who had been very ill for some time, with a consequent loss of earnings. In both cases the Council agreed to pay the whole cost of works of conversion. SUBSCRIPTIONS The Council continued to support the work of the National Society for Clean Air and the London and Home Counties Clean Air Advisory Council. FUEL SUPPUES The severe winter of 1962/63 brought with it some temporary fuel supply difficulties. Only one Area, in Eltham, appeared to be badly affected. Many of the local merchants reported that they were unable to obtain sufficient supplies of the proprietary or 'premium' fuels. This shortage confirmed the publicity given by the Council to residents of the inadvisability of relying entirely upon such fuels with the use of old-fashioned appliances. The supply of Gas cokes was not entirely satisfactory at one time during the worst part of the winter. However, the producers and distributors willingly co-operated with the Council to give residents in Smoke Control Areas the maximum possible assistance. With the aid of the Mayor's Christmas Fund for Old People it was possible to supply old and needy residents with extra smokeless fuel which they could not otherwise have obtained. The severity of the winter brought with it national fuel problems. This prompted Parliamentary questions, and in reply the Minister of Housing and Local Government reported that in the past it had been possible to rely upon open-fire coke being available as -59- the basic domestic replacement for the raw coal previously used, but owing to the rapid technological changes taking place in the gas industry it was clear that a major increase in the production of gas coke could no longer be expected. The Minister felt that at a stage in local authority programmes, varying from place to place, additional supplies of open fire coke may cease to be available, and that changes in current arrangements might be needed to ensure that progress with Smoke Control was not impeded. The Minister reported that an immediate review of the fuel situation was to take place. During the year the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, in conjunction with the Ministry of Power, issued a Circular on the use of gas cokes. Steps were being taken to ensure that unsuitable grades of coke were not sold for use on open fires, and that gas cokes were not knowingly sold as suitable open fire fuels to householders whose grates were not designed to burn them. Arrangements have been made to deal with complaints in this respect. During 1962 the National Coal Board introduced their new fluidlsed char binderless briquettes, popularly known as "Bronowski's bullets". A pilot plant is producing limited quantities for special distribution and testing. The Board hope to make approximately fifty-thousand tons of this new fuel available per year during the next two years. The Minister of Housing and Local Government, by Regulation, included this type of fuel in the list of authorised fuels for the purposes of the Clean Air Act, 1956. CONVERSION COSTS As requested by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the original estimate of cost for each Area has been based upon a 100$ conversion rate. In the New Eltham and Horn Park Areas, which-came into operation in 1962, it was estimated that, after survey, 2,470 private dwellings required works of conversion to the fires, at an estimated cost of £48,543. However, upon completion of the Areas it has been found that final costs have been considerably reduced. -60- The following details show the various factors which gave rise to that reduction:-  New Eltham Smoke Control Area Horn Park Smoke Control Area Number of private properties eligible for conversion. 1,650 820 Total estimated cost £32,430 £16,113 Number of private properties in which conversion was carried out. 687 319 Total approved cost £9,548 £4,215 Total actual cost £17,685 £9,095 This represents a property conversion rate of- 42% 39% -61- Only 211 (31%) in New Eltham, and 98 (30%) in Horn Park carried out the complete solid fuel conversion including gas ignition, for which grant was available. The remainder carried out a variety of works as follows:- (1) Complete solid fuel conversion without gas ignition 107 35 (2) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition 55 36 (3) Part solid fuel conversion without gas ignition. 77 32 W Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition and part electricity 2 - (5) Part solid fuel conversion with gas ignition and part gas fire. 28 11 (6) Part solid fuel conversion without gas ignition and part gas fire. 5 5 (7) Complete conversion by gas fires. 79 39 (8) Part conversion by gas fires. 90 50 (9) Complete conversion by electricity. 13 5 (10) Part conversion by electricity. 15 9 (11) Central Heating. 5 5 (12) Means of ignition only to existing approved appliances. - 4 TABLE NO. 16 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Map Ref.

However, there has been a marked increase in the number of conversions to non-solid fuel appliances. Thus, whilst the total approved expenditure in these Areas is lower than heretofore, the actual further expenditure by residents has increased from £6,100 during 1961/2 to over £12,000 in 1962/3. PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough:- Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague, Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms), Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, the Inspectors see that home isolation continues satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the room sealed and fumigated. A total of 2,093 cases of infectious diseases was notified during the year, being an increase of 1,792 on the previous year. 119 cases were removed to hospital. The substantial' increase in total notifications is due to the large number of notifications of measles (1650 compared with 66 the previous year). POLIOMYELITIS I am pleased to report that for the second year in succession there was no confirmed case. This is encouraging and reflects credit on the immunisation campaign being carried out locally. -63- PUERPERAL PYREXIA Of the 95 notified cases of Puerperal Pyrexia occurring in the Borough, of the patients were not Woolwich mothers. MEASLES The incidence showed its usual alternate yearly rhythm, notifications totalling 1,650. All but two of the notified cases were under the age of 14 years. Forty patients were admitted to the Brook Hospital because of complications. DYSENTERY There were 65 confirmed cases of Dysentery during the year. Although the majority of cases investigated were single unrelated cases, an outbreak occurred at an Eltham Infants School involving 28 children. A full investigation of the water closet and washing facilities was carried out by the Public Health Inspectors, and stool specimens were examined in respect of a large number of children. General Practitioners co-operated fully with the Department. FOOD POISONING Of the four confirmed cases of Food Poisoning, three related to a single family, the agent being identified as Salmonella Typhimurium. -64- TABLE NO. 17 NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (EXCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS), 1963 Under 1 yr. 1-4 yrs. 5-14 yrs. 15-44 yrs. 45-64 yrs. 65 and over Total Admitted to Hospital Scarlet Fever 1 28 53 3 - 1 86 - Meningococcal Infection - - 1 2 - - 3 3 Erysipelas - - 1 3 3 1 8 - Dysentery - 14 43 8 - - 65 2 Zymotic Enteritis - 1 2 4 5 1 13 1 Pneumonia 2 2 5 12 18 32 71 9 Food Poisoning - 1 - 2 - - 3 - Puerperal Pyrexia - - - 97 - - 97 95 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 8 - - - - - 8 8 Whooping Cough 11 39 31 - - - 81 3 Measles 56 809 763 21 1 1 1650 40 Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - - Smallpox - - - - - - - - Paratyphoid Fever - - - 3 1 1 5 3 Scabies - 2 - 1 - - 3 - TABLE NO. 18 TUBERCULOSIS Table of Notifications and Deaths compared with Population Borough of Woolwich Year Estimated Civilian Population excluding Army Primary Notifications Deaths from Tuberculosis Deaths per 1,000 of population Total Deaths all Causes Percentage of Tuberculosis Deaths against all Deaths 1953 146,000 156 29 .20 1,569 1.8 1954 145,000 200 21 .14 1,443 1.4 1955 145,000 154 23 .15 1,537 1.4 1956 144,000 155 22 .14 1,524 1.4 1957 143,000 145 22 .14 1,504 1.4 1958 142,000 101 20 .14 1,514 1.3 1959 142,000 86 14 .09 1,542 .9 1960 143,000 72 9 .06 1,424 .6 1961 146,850 56 16 .11 l,6l6 .9 1962 148,000 63 10 .06 1,580 .6 1963 148,000 45 16 .10 1,790 .9 TABLE NO. 19 The following is an extract from the Tuberculosis Register for 1963:- Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F Total M F Total Cases notified for the first time 19 19 38 5 2 7 Other additions to Register during the year, including transfers of patients from other areas. 20 27 47 2 - 2 Cases on Register at 31st December, 1963. 773 645 l,4l8 44 64 108 The following Table gives the age groups of new cases notified:- Formal Notifications Number of Primary Notifications of New Cases 0- 1 1- 4 5- 14 15- 24 2534 3544 4554 5564 6574 75 & up Total (All ages) PULMONARY- Males - 1 1 2 2 6 3 1 3 - 19 Females - - 2 3 4 2 5 1 2 - 19 NON-PULMONARY- Males - - - 1 1 2 1 - - - 5 Females - - 1 - - - 1 - - - 2 TOTAL: - 1 4 6 7 10 10 2 5 1 45 MASS X-RAY SERVICE I am indebted to Dr. Morgan, the Director of the South East London Mass X-Ray Service for the following information on the work of the Unit in the Borough during 1963. -h6~ Altogether 21,783 people were x-rayed during 1963, and 29 cases of Tuberculosis requiring close supervision or hospital treatment, and a further 46 requiring occasional supervision, were discovered. A further 28 were previously known Tuberculous cases. A breakdown of those examined is shown in the following Table Numbers examined Cases found Men Women Men Women Public Surveys 4,340 5,830 3 5 Public Surveys Examination of Special Groups 116 52 - - Firms: Full Scale Visits 2,860 1,435 7 2 Firms: Examination of Special Groups 1,494 9 - - Regular Sites (Woolwich and Mottingham) 2,689 1,214 6 5 Colleges, Hospitals, etc. 658 1,086 - 1 TOTALS: 12,157 9,626 16 13 21,783 29 Of the total of 21,783 persons examined, 9,828 people had not been previously x-rayed. Included in the total x-rayed were 10,170 persons who were examined at the special Public Survey during the year; 6,231 of these had not been previously examined. Other Non-Tuberculous Abnormalities found included the following:- MEN (59) WOMEN (41) Carcinoma of bronchus 9 Carcinoma of bronchus 1 Sarcoidosis 2 Old lobectomy for Carcinoma of bronchus 1 Pneumoconiosis with PMF 1 Neuro-fibroma 1 Sarcoidosis 3 Pneumonitis 14 Pneumonitis 16 Encysted effusion 1 Hamaeotma 1 Chronic Bronchitis & Emphysema 10 Bronchiectasis 2 Pleural thickening & fibrosis 2 -67- MEN WOMEN Pleurisy 2 Atelectasis of middle lobe 1 Atelectasis super-imposed Asthma 2 on Chronic Bronchitis 1 Pericardial cyst 1 Pleural thickening 10 Pleuro-pericardial adhesions 1 Hilar shadow - probably vascular 1 Hiatus hernia 3 Diaphragmatic hernia 1 Fractured rib 1 Paralysed R. diaphragm 1 Pericardial cyst 1 Right phrenic paralysis 1 Diaphragmatic hernia 1 Calcified thyroid adenoma 1 Muscular dystrophy 1 Retrosternal goitre 2 Gynecomastia 1 Pad of fat 1 Peptic ulcer 1 DISINFECTION AND DI3INFESTATI0N Resulting from notifications of infectious diseases 188 rooms occupied by affected persons were disinfected by the staff of the Department. Of the number of rooms disinfected 66 were occupied by patients with Tuberculosis. Over 1,000 inspections were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors to check on possible verminous conditions, and as a consequence 177 rooms were disinfested of vermin by the staff of the Health Department. A number of items of old and unwanted furniture, sometimes verminous and usually owned by elderly persons who had died, was collected from 31 premises and destroyed by the Department. In addition, a further six bedsteads, 12 sets of bedding and 15 soiled or wornout mattresses were collected and destroyed. To accompany consignments of rag wipers for export 26 Certificates of Hygiene were issued to a local laundry who specialise in the production of rag wipers. The firm concerned paid a small charge for each Certificate. Many importing countries, particularly those behind the Iron Curtain, require a Certificate showing that clothing has been efficiently disinfected before any clothing is allowed to be imported into the country. Three residents desirous of sending parcels of clothing to friends or relations living abroad asked for the necessary Disinfection Certificates to accompany the clothing. The requests were granted and a small charge was made in each case for the necessary disinfection. -68- AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination or inoculation. The signatures on these Certificates are not acceptable by the countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a Doctor practising within the area. During 1963, 636 Certificates were authenticated by me; 542 related to protection against Smallpox; 64 for Cholera, and 30 for T.A.B. inoculation. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal Cleansing Stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths in Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service. Specimens sent to this Laboratory include samples of milk and Ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the local slaughterhouse, and samples of swimming bath water. swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the Laboratory on behalf of the Council during 1963:- Type of Specimen No. Examined Ice-cream (Methylene Blue test) 2 Milk (Statutory tests on Pasteurised, Sterilised and T.T. milks) 178 Food 2 Water (from swimming baths, paddling and boating pools) 21 Organs from Animal Carcases (Sections) 12 215 -69 • The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the Hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at the St. Nicholas Hospital. The convenience of this service is much appreciated by the local doctors and by the Department.
