The Index to the Quarterly and Annual Reports, extending from October, 1856, to June, 1879, inclusive, has reference not only to the Sanitary Work which has been carried out during the last twenty-three years, but it also embraces some particulars of the Sanitary Condition of the District before the formation of your Board, and has reference to several Nuisances which were suppressed by the authority of the Board of Guardians, and contains a few particulars respecting the Displacement of Large Populations by the Formation of the Docks, Commercial Street, Blackwall Railway, &c. The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act 1879, in Section 14, gives power to the Local Authority to Open-out Closed or Partially Closed Alleys or Courts inhabited by the Labouring Classes, and to Widen the same, by pulling down any building or otherwise, leaving such Open Spaces as may be necessary, to make such Alleys or Courts healthful. Similar recommendations were made by me in my Reports for December, 1856, Page 4, January, 1858, Page 7, and March, 1872, Page 12. September '29th, 1879. JOHN LIDDLE. CONTENTS.
