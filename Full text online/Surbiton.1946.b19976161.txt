To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am presenting my 25th Annual Report to which is attached the Sanitary Inspector's Report. I would draw your attention to the very low figure of the infant mortality rate and the increase in population as registered by the Registrar General. Ninety prefabricated bungalows were erected during the year but no permanent Council houses were built. It might be as well for the Council to consider the provision of accommodation for the elderly people in the form of a block of houses, hostels, etc., each house having two to three rooms, and the provision of suitable persons, such as women with nursing experience or nurses to look after the old tenants, the nurse being responsible for a certain number of houses. I wish to thank all the members of my staff for their assistance during the past year. STATISTICS.

You will note that the population for 1945 was 50,360; now. it is 56,420 which means that in the space of twelve months the population has risen by over 5,000 persons. Referring to my Annual Report of 1945 it wa3 stated that overcrowding existed then which suggests that the extra 5,000 have been accommodated, in many cases, in already overcrowded houses .

ICE CREAM. Eleven persons are registered "by the Corporation for the manufacture, storage and sale of ice cream and fifty-three for storage and sale but not manufacture. On the 8th October, 1946, the Minister of Health issued Circular 183/46 in which he stated that it was proposed to make regulations for the better protection of the public health against risk of infection from the consumption of ice cream. The Minister pointed out that he had received representations that the cleanliness of ice cream, as shown "by bacteriological tests, was often found to be far from satisfactory, and that to facilitate the work of local authorities in securing the adoption of hygienic methods in the preparation and handling of the commodity, cleanliness tests for ice cream should be prescribed. The minister further stated that he was advised that, while bacteriological tests any usefully be employed as an indication of possible faulty methods, no test has yet been devised of the safety of ice cream; and that there is no known test which would be sufficiently reliable for use as a statutory test of its contamination with non-pathogenic organisms. The Regulations did not come into force until the 1st Lay,1947, so that no experience of their operation was obtained during the year under review in this Report. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS. There are forty-three persons registered in accordance with the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, as follows:- Wholesale Traders or Producers of milk 7 Retail purveyors of milk residing in the district 28 Retail purveyors residing outside the district but retailing in the district 8 In consequence of the Rationalisation Scheme only thirteen retailers are know selling milk in the Borough, but the others have expressed a wish not to be removed from the register. Eight dealers' licences to sell "Pasteurised" milk, six to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk, two supplementary licences to sell "pasteurised" milk and two to sell "Tuberculin Tested" milk were granted under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936. Thirty samples of milk were taken for phosphatase test to ascertain if pasteurisation had been properly carried out. Twentyeight were found to be satisfactory but two (both from the same dairy) did not pass the test. Necessary action was taken and further samples were satisfactory. - 23 - DISINFECTION. During the year disinfection was carried out at sixteen civilian premises in which the following diseases occurred:- Diphtheria 1 Dysentery 1 Scarlet Fever 1 Tuberculosis 13 Disinfection was also carried out at twenty-three premises after cases of non-notifiable diseases, the occupiers in each case paying the cost. The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Isolation Hospital or destroyed was:- Disinfected Destroyed Beds 10 — Blankets 52 — Bolsters 12 1 Counterpanes 9 — Cushions 10 — Mattresses 41 1 Mattress Covers 1 — Pillows 107 4 Pillow cases 8 — Rugs 4 — Sheets 13 — Towels 4 — Wearing apparel 32 — Miscellaneous 10 — 313 6 Number of rooms disinfected 26 Number of library books 53 ERADICATION OF BED BUGS.

"Vermicine" Spray - 6 PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year fifty-nine bodies were received into the Mortuary, fifty-eight post mortem examinations were carried out and fourteen inquests held. One body was received into the Mortuary pending burial. In this case a post mortem examination was not necessary. - 24 - CIVIL AMBULANCE. In August the Corporation purchased a Daimler 20 H.P. ambulance nd disposed of the ex-Civil Defence ambulance which was not satisfactory. In addition to the Daimler, the Corporation also owns a 1934 18 H.P. Talbot. It was the Corporation's intention to sell the Talbot ambulance but an advertisement brought no offers, and it was, therefore, decided to retain it for use as reserve ambulance. during the year 312 accident and 472 private cases were dealt with. The mileage covered by the Daimler ambulance was 2,059 miles and by the Talbot 5,507 miles. The personnel consists of two drivers and two attendants working twenty-four hour shifts. The St. John Ambulance Brigade arranges for one of its members to he in attendance each evening to assist the permanent staff, a service which is much appreciated. BUILDING LICENCES. During the year 707 applications for building licences, involving 902 visits to premises, were dealt with in my Department, and suitable recommendations made to the Borough Surveyor who is Licensing Officer. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The responsibility for disinfestation rests, by law, upon the occupiers of premises, and a charge is always made when, the Corporation undertakes work at the request of occupiers. The scale approved by the Town Council is 2/6d per servicing visit which includes labour, transport, traps, poisons and baits. Special terms are quoted for cases requiring long-term treatment. No charge is made for inspections and advisory visits. Number of complaints received during year 115 Number of visits made 851 Number of premises found to he infested 172 Number of private premises treated by Corporation on payment 39 Number of re-treatments 37 Number of treatments of Corporation properties 26 Number of premises in respect of which advice was given to occupiers to enable them to carry out disifestation themselves 103 Number of premises in respect of which action was pending at end of year 4 All infestations were of a minor type. Owing to labour difficulties no progress could he made with the treatment of sewers. - 25 - COUNCIL HOUSES AND REQUISITIONED PROPERTIES. In July, as a consequence of staff changes made by the Corporation, the work of maintenance of Council Houses and adaptation and maintenance of Requisitioned Properties reverted to the Department. CONCLUSION. It has fallen to my lot to prepare this Report in consequence of the death on 29th March, 1947, of the former Chief Sanitary Inspector and housing Officer, the late Mr. Geoffrey McClelland, to whom I acted as deputy during the year under review. The loss of the Chief was a severe blow to the Department, and was keenly felt by all members of the staff. His death at such an early age was a tragedy, and I am sure that all with whom he was associated will greatly miss the friendly help and guidance which he was always so ready to give. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to the staff of the deportment who have so ably and willingly supported me during a very difficult period, I am also most grateful to the Medical Officer of Health and my colleagues in other departments whose help and advice has been so freely given. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, H, J. ELDRIDGE, Senior Sanitary Inspector. - 26 -
