Presented pursuant to the 198th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18 and 19 Vic. Cap. 120 VISITATION OF CHOLERA. In consequence of the prevalence of Cholera in the Metropolis, an Order in Council * was issued, dated the 21st July, 1866, which was received by the Vestry on the 26th. The directions and regulations contained therein having been read and considered, a Resolution was passed, instructing the Sanitary Committee to carry out with all possible energy and despatch the provisions contained in the Order as far as may be necessary, and the Churchwardens and Overseers were added to the Committee for the purpose. The Committee and the Medical Officer of Health were called together immediately, and having considered the nature of the duties thus devolving upon them, it was— Resolved and ordered, on the 30th July, as follows :— That the Clerk do ascertain and write to all the Medical Practitioners in the Parish, requesting them to furnish the Vestry with information of the presence of any Cholera or Diarrhoea, or the existence of any nuisance injurious to health, which may come under their notice. That this Committee do meet at 11 o'clock in the morning, on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, in each week until otherwise arranged, for the purpose of receiving information and acting as circumstances may require. That the present Medical Officers of the poor be and are hereby appointed "Medical Visitors" under the Order for the purposes therein set forth, for their respective Districts. That the Dispensaries of such Medical Visitors be the Dispensaries for their respective Districts, and that they be available night and day. That they be authorized to employ nurses where necessary. That a Special place be provided by thus Committee for the reception of the sick. That the Medical Visitors be authorized to provide a place or places for separating the healthy from the sick if necessary. * See Appendix No. 1. 5 That the Medical Visitors be instructed to provide, and use, and distribute disinfectants liberally. That they be empowered to force entrance into infected premises, for the purpose of disinfecting, cleansing, &c., when and where necessary, and to call in the aid of the Police where necessary. That they (the Medical Visitors) direct rough-cleansing, limewhiting, cleansing of water-butts, &c., where necessary, and that a man be employed by the Vestry for the purpose. That they be empowered to order the burial of the dead where necessary, by the Parochial Undertaker employed by the Guardian Board. That the Pumps in Amwell Street, and Aylesbury Street, (the water being of doubtful quality,) be locked up for the present. That hand-bills be issued, addressed specially to the owners of stables, mews, and the like, requiring the prompt removal of dung, &c., and the proper pavement of their premises. Instructional letters, enclosing copy of the Order in Council, were accordingly forthwith addressed to the Medical Visitors so appointed, and the Medical Practitioners of the Parish were communicated with as directed.* The Committee continued to meet as arranged, assisted from time to time by Dr. Griffith the Medical Officer of Health, Mr. H. J. Brown, Mr. Goddard, Mr. Eugene Goddard, and Mr. Hudson, the Medical Visitors. Hand-bills, large and small, were printed and posted, and circulated throughout the Parish, giving precautions and directions against Cholera, the names and adddesses of the Medical Visitors, and the Dispensaries where medicines might be had gratis, &c., and inviting information and co-operation, especially from the clergy and medical profession. Failing to obtain premises in Woodbridge Street, suggested as a Cholera Hospital, the Royal Free, The Fever, and St. Bartholomews Hospitals were communicated with, with the view to coming to terms for the admission of Cholera patients in case of need, and the result was that an arrangement was made with the Royal Free Hospital for the admission of Cholera patients at £1 1s. per case. Chloride of Lime was ordered to be kept on the Vestry's premises, to be supplied gratis to the poor applying for it, and to be used where required. Several cases of death from Cholera having occurred wherein it was necessary to destroy the infected clothing, bedding, &c., the Committee directed that in all such cases the infected articles be * See Appendix No. 2. 6 destroyed upon the premises, where practicable, and men were placed at the disposal of the Medical Officer and Medical Visitors for this purpose, and to obviate as much as possible the inconvenience to the poor caused thereby, arrangements were made with the Guardian Board to supply such persons, on account of the Vestry, with any articles of clothing, bedding, &c., in lieu of such as had been so destroyed, on receiving an order for same from the Vestry Clerk. The Committee, after most of their sittings, proceeded to view any premises or localities to which their attention had been called as requiring Sanitary improvement, and gave such directions as appeared necessary, and it is hoped much good was thus done by way of preventive measures. By direction of the Committee the walls and ceilings of all entries, dung pits, &c., which appeared to require it, were lime-whited by men employed by the Vestry for the purpose. The public urinals (and also many private ones abutting on public streets), were tarred and cleansed daily, including Sundays, and chloride of lime was freely used about them and the street gullies, &c. On the suggestion of the Medical Officer of Health, the New River Company was communicated with, with the view to a water supply being furnished on Sundays, during August and September, especially to the poorer localities; and the Vestry have much pleasure in acknowledging the readiness with which this was afforded by the Company. The Vestry also beg to acknowledge the ready and gratuitous supply of tar for the urinals afforded by the Chartered Gas Company, from their works in Goswell Road. Courts in Turnmill Street.—The Cholera having visited these courts, a Deputation of Inhabitants waited upon the Home Secretary with a Memorial upon the subject of the Sanitary condition of these places, which resulted in the following correspondence :— The Secretary of State to the Vestry Clerk. Local Government Act Office, 8, Richmond Terrace, 3439c. Whitehall. S.W. 66. 29th October, 1866. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Walpole to transmit to you, for communication to the Vestry of Clerkenwell, the enclosed copy of a Memorial presented to him by a Deputation from Clerkenwell, calling attention to the Sanitary condition of certain localities in the parish. 7 I am to call the attention of the Vestry to the 49th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and to state that the Secretary of State hopes that by prompt attention to the removable sources of nuisances and disease specified by the Deputation, and described in this Memorial, the Vestry will render it unnecessary for the Secretary of State further to exercise the powers vested in him by the 49th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866. He will be glad to receive from the Vestry a report on the nuisances specified in the Memorial, and a statement of the steps taken under their direction, with respect to these nuisances. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) T. TAYLOR. The Vestry Clerk, Clerkenwell. [enclosure.] To the Right Honorable Spencer H. Walpole, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for the Home Department. We the Deputation which waited on you this day, beg most respectfully to bring under your notice the Sanitary condition of Bitt's Alley, Frying Pan Alley, Rose Alley, Lamb Square, Broad Yard, and Union Place, situated in Turnmill Street, near the Farringdon Road Station of the Metropolitan Railway, in the District of Cow Cross, in the Parish of Clerkenwell : Some of the places above mentioned are blind alleys, so that when fever comes, a frequent visitant, it is difficult to arrest its progress for want of that free current of air obtained only in thoroughfares. There is but one privy for forty families, the average number residing in each alley, and the soil may sometimes be seen running down into the main thoroughfares, a state of things revolting to a more refined condition of society. In Broad Yard, a privy is within six yards of a room where both parents have recently died from Cholera, leaving five orphans unprovided for, and in close proximity to this privy six other persons have been attacked with Cholera, five of whom have also died. There is only one really efficient dust-bin for the whole of the alleys, and very recently the contractor refused to take away some dust until the Vestry paid him more money, and a neighbour had it removed, defraying the charge from his own purse. The water supply is not as it should be; it is turned on for halfan-hour daily, and is conveyed to the houses through small pipes, 8 but there are not receptacles in the houses or alleys to keep a reserve, an evil we think requires to be remedied. We also think the alleys ought to be frequently flushed with clean water, which the Vestry have refused to do. We beg to refer you to an Act to amend the Law relating to Public Health, 7th August, 1866, clauses 16, 34, 49. and 50, which seems to meet our case. (Signed)—W. J. RIVINGTON, A. SOUTHEY. On behalf of the Deputation. 52, St. John's Square, Clerkenwell, E.C. 24th October, 1866. The Vestry Clerk's Reply. Yestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 23, Upper Rosoman Street, E.C., November 9th, 1866. Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication dated the 29th ulto., which has been duly laid before the Sanitary Committee of this Vestry, and in accordance with their instructions I beg to submit the following observations with reference to the subject of the Memorial to the Secretary of State, a copy of which you enclosed. The Vestry have long been fully alive to the Sanitary condition of the courts in Turnmill Street, viz.: Bitt Alley, Frying Pan Alley, Rose Alley, Lamb Square, and Broad Yard. These courts are a colony of costermongers and others of that class, whose habits and notions of cleanliness are of the lowest and most repulsive kind, and are the most difficult to be dealt with. In 1857, the attention of the Yestry having been called to the state of the courts by the Medical Officer of Health, a Sanitary Committee was specially appointed to inspect them, when it was found that the houses were filthy, the privies foul in the extreme, and without pans, traps, or water laid on, and orders were at once issued to remedy these defects ; the Committee, however, found the disposition and habits of the people themselves so hopelessly reckless and filthy that they reported :— "That though they have adopted such remedies as the immediate "emergencies of these places require, cannot but express their "strong conviction that nothing less than the absolute removal "of the present tenements will bring about a Sanitary state "more conducive to the health and morals of the neighbourhood, "and they therefore beg to recommend this step to the serious "consideration of the Vestry." 9 The Vestry, however, did not deem it expedient to take any action in this direction, or of closing the premises, feeling the importance and difficulty of the question involved, viz.: the displacement of the poor, they therefore made special provision in their Scavenging Contracts for the daily cleansing of these courts which has ever since been rigidly carried out. In 1858, the Sanitary Committee, after a special inspection, again reported:— "That whilst deploring the filthy state of these courts and alleys, "this Committee deem it impracticable to effect any material "improvement therein beyond the daily cleansing and scavenging "already in practice, the nuisance so often complained of arising "from the filthy habits of the inhabitants, rather than from the "defective state of the premises." In 1861, complaints having been made of insufficient water supply, the Sanitary Committee examined same, and directed that a water supply be laid on to each house, or that sufficient cisterns be fixed in the yards for the purpose, which has since been done, and with which the inhabitants, at least of Frying Pan Alley and Bitt Alley, have expressed themselves perfectly satisfied. The "filthy habits" herein referred to have reference more particularly to the use, or rather the misuse, of the water-closets by the people, who, instead of using them as such, render them totally unfit for use, by invariably covering the seats and floors with the contents of their chamber and other utensils, thereby creating a "state of things," in the words of the Memorialists, "revolting to a more refined condition of society." This being the prevailing practice, the Committee have not thought it expedient to enforce compliance with their order to pan and trap, and lay water on to such privies, feeling convinced, from experience, that to pan and trap would only be to increase the nuisance by obstruction, and to lay water on would be utterly useless. They have also felt, that to increase the number of privies where they are so used, would only be to increase the number of nuisances. The owners have therefore been prevailed upon by the Committee to appoint and pay persons to flush and cleanse these privies, daily, which is done, but no sooner it is done, than they are as bad again as ever, and the people seem to delight and exult in so doing. Since the receipt of the Order in Council of July last, with reference to the approach of Cholera, the Sanitary Committee having been instructed by the Vestry to carry out its provisions to the utmost, have been meeting every other day, (till just lately,) and have been unremitting in their efforts, in conjunction with the Medical Officer of Health and "Medical Visitors" under the Order, to adopt all precautionary sanitary measures in their power, and among other 10 places these courts have received their anxious consideration and attention. They have visited them from time to time, and on the 15th ulto. specially with reference to the flushing them frequently with water, as suggested by a person residing in the locality. These courts are receptacles for all kinds of costermongers' refuse, brought from all parts of the metropolis, and deposited in the dustbins and other places about the yards; and although all which comes in the way of the scavenger's broom is removed daily, still there is always a great quantity thrown among the dust heaps in the yards, (created by the people instead of using the dust-bins,) and to flush the yards where rubbish is so deposited, would, in the opinion of the Committee create a greater nuisance than the flushing was intended to remove, they therefore declined to adopt the suggestion. Tho Dust Contractor having refused to remove the refuse in question, the Vestry have for some time past been paying extra specially for its removal three times a week at the least, and they are now in litigation with the Contractor upon the subject. Upon this visit orders were given for sundry improvements required, but at the next meeting of tho Committee (on tho 17th), they came to a determination that, unless the owners and inhabitants at once took tho necessary means of putting and keeping tho places in a more satisfactory state, steps should bo taken to endeavour to shut them up as unfit for human habitation. The Medical Officer thereupon examined and defined what he considered should be done, and his memoranda were laid before the Committee on the 29th, and it was then resolved that such suggestions be carried out—and orders were issued accordingly. I annex copy of the Medical Officer's memoranda just referred to. Union Place, named in tho Memorial, is not in this Parish. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. T.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Walpole, to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your letter of the 9th inst., with the reply of the Sanitary Committee of the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, to the communication from this office, on the subject of the Memorial of which a copy was sent to the Vestry. The Secretary of State is fully aware of the great difficulty which the habits of those who inhabit the courts and alleys referred to by the Deputation from Clerkenwell, and in this answer of the Vestry, interpose in the way of Sanitary improvement. The Memorial [moaning the communication from the Vestry] shews that the Vestry have not been sparing of their efforts to remedy the indecent and unwholesome state of filth in which the privies of this district are kept by the recklessness of the occupiers of the houses, and to enforce the periodical removal of refuse. The Secretary of State is disposed to agree with the Vestry, that if the landlords of these houses do not take more stringent measures for enforcing on the tenants a stricter observance of the obvious requirements of decency and cleanliness, and do not them selves provide what is necessary for this purpose in the way of privies, ash-bins, water-cisterns, and sowers, the best course for the Vestry would be to apply for orders for shutting the houses up as unfit for human habitation. The Secretary of State will be glad to learn what effect the threat of the Vestry to take this course has had. In the meantime, there are some specific allegations in the Memorial of the Deputation to which the attention of the Vestry may, it would seem, be usefully directed. "There is only one really efficient dust-bin for the whole of the alleys," and the allegations that "the water supply is not as it should be. It is turned on for half an hour daily, and is conveyed to the houses through small pipes, but there are no receptacles in the houses or alloys to keep a reserve ; an evil we think requires to be remedied." 13 In the absence of precise references in the Memorial, it is impossible to say whether the cases in which the Medical Officer has made suggestions are those to which the memorial refers. I am to enquire if proceedings have been taken under the Nuisance Removal Act, to obtain orders for enforcing the Medical Officer's suggestions. I am, dear Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) T. TAYLOR. ROBERT PAGET, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Clerkenwell. The Vestry Clerk's Reply. Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 23, Upper Rosoman Street, E.C. December 12 th, 1866. Sir, Your letter of the 13th ulto. has been duly received and laid before our Sanitary Committee and the Vestry, and I have to state in reply thereto as follows :— With reference to the allegation in the memorial referred to "The water supply is not as it should be—It is turned on for halfan-hour daily, and is conveyed to the houses through small pipes, but there are no receptacles in the houses or alleys to keep a reserve, an evil we think requires to be remedied." After the receipt of your letter, I again visited the courts in question along with your Medical Officer, for the purpose of making personal enquiry upon the subject, and found the inhabitants of Lamb Square, Bitt Alley, and Frying Pan Alley, (forming really one court, the communication being common to all), all agree in stating that they have always an abundant supply of water from a large cistern erected by order of the Vestry some time ago. In Rose Alley, the supply is from a cistern which would evidently be ample, but the inhabitants, instead of drawing it off as they require it, recklessly draw it off to till their own tubs, &c., in their own houses, whether they require it or not, and consequently the cistern is sometimes exhausted before the next supply comes on, which is at a certain hour daily, but the people agree that they have generally plenty in their houses, and that it is very rare that any of them are without; nevertheless, an additional cistern has recently been ordered here by the Vestry, and it is now in course of construction. 14 In Broad Yard, a separate supply is provided for every one or two houses, and the inhabitants all agree that they have ample. The allegation in therefore, I submit, without foundation. With reference to the statement that "there is only one really efficient dust bin for the whole of the alleys" I have to state that there is one large dust-bin, common to the first three named places, and this is ample for the purpose; it is cleared out throe times a week; and if there is any untidiness in this respect about the premises, it is owing to the people carelessly throwing their dust down anywhere, instead of taking the trouble to go a few yards to deposit it in the Dust-bin. The same may be said as regards Rose Alley, there being also one largo bin common to the court. In Broad Yard, there are two recognized places for depositing dust and other refuse, and whore the costermongers also place their barrows and trucks, and to wall those places up as dustbins would be inconvenient, and would so interfere with these barrows and trucks as would doubtless cause the immediate demolition of the dust-bins if constructed. This refuse, as in the other cases, is removed by the Dust Contractor three times a week at the least. With regard to the suggestions made by the Medical Officer, contained in my last, notices have boon duly served on the owners to carry them out; some of the works required, such as cleansing and limewhiting, have been done, others are in progress, such as constructing additional water closets and water-cisterns in Rose Alley; others have not been attended to, and therefore legal steps are being taken under the Nuisance 'Removal Acts to enforce the orders of the Vestry. I may add, that although the panning and trapping, and laying water on to the water-closets, as recommended by the Medical Officer, will bo enforced, our Sanitary Committee, from their experience of the inhabitants of these courts, have no faith in the success of the experiment. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. T. TAYLOR, Esq., Local Government Act Office, 8, Richmond Terrace, Whitehall. 15 The Secretary of State to the Vestry Clerk. Local Government Act Office, 8, Richmond Terrace, Whitehall, S.W. December 18th, 1866. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Walpole, to acknowledge, with thanks, the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, in reply to the Memorial as to the Sanitary state of the courts in Turnmill Street, &c., &c. A copy of your letter has been sent to the Memorialists. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) T. TAYLOR. R. PAGET, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell. The Cholera having in a great measure subsided, and all practicable precautions having been adopted, the Sanitary Committee, in November, discontinued their frequent meetings, and agreed to meet only as occasion may require as usual. And the Vestry unanimously passed a vote of thanks to them for the valuable and important services rendered by them in the discharge of their very onerous duties during the late visitation of Cholera. For the statistics of Cholera cases, &c., see the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The expenses incurred on account of this epidemic, amounting to £413 15s. 11d.* will be found in the Balance Sheet annexed. ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. * Subsequent to the period embraced in this Report, the Vestry unanimously presented the Vestry Clerk with the sum of Twenty Guineas, in consideration of the extra services rendered by him during the visitation of Cholera; and also the sum of Eight Guineas to Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, Master and Matron of the Workhouse, in consideration of extra services in supplying Bedding, &c., in sundry cases, which makes the total expenses £443 3s. 11d.

Gentlemen, I have the honor to present to you my Eleventh Annual Report upon the sanitary state of the district. For the sake of comparison, I shall endeavour to preserve the same form as that adopted in my preceding Reports. The number of deaths occurring from all causes in the district, during the year 1866, was 1661. The average of deaths for the last ten years was 1522; hence the deaths wero 139 more than the average. The absolute mortality during the last ten years is shown below, the number of births being added:— Deaths. Births. In 1857 1406 2219 1858 1477 2220 1859 1374 2175 1860 1383 2279 1861 1494 2295 1862 1572 2287 1863 1509 2449 1864 1735 2224 1865 1613 2389 1866 1661 2434 Average 1522 2297 During each year, a certain number of deaths of the inhabitants of the district takes place in General and Special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The number of these appertaining to the year 1866 is 135. As shown above, the births taking place in the year were 2434; 639 of them occurring in the first quarter, 616 in the second, 608 in the third, and 571 in the last quarter. Hence there is a natural increase of population for the year, of 773. In the preceding year, the deaths being 1613, and the births 2389, the natural increase was 776; which very nearly agrees with that of the past year. The average of births for the last ten years being 2297, the births taking place in 1866 were 137 more than the average. 26 The number of deaths occurring from Zymotic* diseases in 1866, was 409; the average for the last nine years being 366. Thus the Zymotic deaths were 4.9 more than the average, but 28 more than occurred in the preceding year, when they were 381. The number of deaths which occurred from the principal Zymotic diseases was 342, that for the preceding year being 316. The causes and numbers of these deaths for the last ten years are exhibited in the subjoined Table. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhoea. Typhus. (In Fever Hospital) Totals. Deaths from all causes. 1857 6 51 42 84 65 47 + 9 295 1406 1858 5 69 64 61 55 31 + 8 285 1477 1859 9 24 82 87 68 31 + 6 301 1374 1860 10 39 50 62 38 27 + 5 226 1383 1861 0 22 95 107 72 44+17 340 1494 1862 1 76 133 53 42 70 + 9 375 1572 1863 26 44 136 66 52 42 + 8 376 1509 1864 7 73 94 71 87 46 + 9 378 1735 1865 12 27 57 88 84 48 + 5 316 1613 1866 6 42 59 95 93 47 + 4 342 1661 This term, which was proposed by Dr. Farr, of the Registrar General s Office, is now generally employed to signify Infectious, Epidemic, ana Endemic diseases. 27 The number of deaths occurring from all causes in infants and children under five years of age, was 736; the numbers for the preceding nine years having been 663, 656, 628, 624, 707, 724, 728, 789, and 700, the average being 691. 354 deaths occurred at and above 60 years of age, including 71 at and above 80. 295 deaths occurred from pulmonary diseases, the number for the preceding year being 293. 156 deaths took place in the Workhouse; the numbers for the last seven years having been 120, 137, 160, 172, 158, 167, and 174. 29 deaths occurred in the House of Correction; and 2 in the House of Detention. The numbers for the preceding year were 38 and 4 respectively. The accidental deaths were 20, against 19 in 1865, viz.: 8 from fractures and contusions, 1 from wounds, 1 from burns, 7 from suffocation, and 3 from other causes. 1 death was produced by murder, that of an infant. 4 deaths arose from suicide, viz.:—2 from wounds, 1 from poison, and 1 from hanging. These are the principal numerical data relating to the mortality of the year. The Table appended to this Report gives a statement of the causes and numbers of the deaths, with the ages at which they occurred, in further detail. In deciding upon the rate of mortality occurring in the district, we are at once met by the difficulty of determining the number of inhabitants, in consequence of being unable to ascertain how many have left, from their dwellings having been pulled down. So that we can do little more than compare the absolute numbers of deaths occurring in one year with those which have taken place in former years. Taking the rate of increase found to have ensued between the years 1851 and 1861, the increase would amount to 541. Adding to this number that of the occupants of the Corporation Buildings (811), and of the Cobden Buildings, containing 20 families (say 80), we should have an addition of 1432 to the inhabitants of the district. But considering the number of houses pulled down in the Farringdon Road, and their occupants, this number would have to be reduced to an uncertain extent. Yet, on the whole, there can be no doubt that the number of 28 inhabitants has increased, and we must therefore expect an increase of mortality. Summing up the above data, it is clear that the deaths for the year are above the average; that they are more than in the preceding year; and that the principal Zymotic diseases have also increased. These Zymotic diseases are the principal concern of the Sanitary Department of a Vestry; and no doubt if all the conditions under which they occur were under the control of sanitary officers, we could greatly reduce the mortality arising from them. But this would require that we should ensure a free supply of pure water; that the water receptacles be kept clean; that the inhabitants be not too crowded in their dwellings; that these dwellings should be kept clean; that the clothes and linen be also kept clean, and especially purified when epidemic diseases occur; that the dwellings be well ventilated; and that the inhabitants should be well fed, and the children well nursed and cared for. The effect which the attendance to and neglect of these particulars has upon the mortality of a population may be well shown by the perusal of the subjoined Table, where the mortality arising in infants and children of the poor is compared with that of the rest of a parish. Mortality per 10,000 of the population, in Children under five years of age. Causes of Death. Standard Mortality of Infants in Healthy Districts. Mortality of Infants. I. II.

And with this distress, and the resulting poverty, is too often combined a total neglect of sanitary laws, particularly that relating to cleanliness. In fact it is mostly a disagreeable and 29 painful circumstance to visit the dwellings of the poor; the dirty houses, the dirty floors, the dirty beds, and heaps of dirty clothes are too often met with. And when this is the case, the parents and the family dependent upon them will surely suffer, even to their lives. In the spring of the year, as the Small Pox was prevalent, the handbills were posted up throughout the Parish. The Small Pox has been very prevalent throughout the Metropolis during the last few years. In 18G6 it caused 1388 deaths. In Clerkenwell it caused 6 deaths. One also took place in the Small Pox Hospital, among 33 sent from this district. In my opinion, the want of Vaccination is not the cause of the great prevalence of this disease, but the overcrowding. Neglect of vaccination will ensure a large mortality, for it must be a very debilitated person who dies from Small Pox after vaccination. The law regarding vaccination is practically inoperative, because to obtain conviction it must be proved that the parent or guardian of the unvaccinated person has received a notice from the District Registrar; and this is very difficult to accomplish. As the law is about to be amended, it is hoped this difficulty will be abolished. Surely the 33 persons sent to the Small Pox Hospital must mostly have been vaccinated, otherwise the mortality would have amounted to more than one death. To express the point briefly, I should say that the overcrowding causes the spread of the disease, and the neglect of vaccination causes the mortality. The deaths from Typhus (47) were nearly the same as in the preceding year (48). During the year, 67 cases were sent to the Fever Hospital, 4 deaths taking place; in the preceding year the cases sent away were 58, with 5 deaths. In looking over the localities where the cases of Typhus have occurred we recognize some old faces—Bitt Alley (3), Rose Alley (4), and Broad Yard (13 cases). The mortality of the year was raised by the prevalence, in an epidemic form, of a disease which fortunately but rarely visits us; I mean the Cholera. In my preceding Report, for 1865, I remarked that "The occurrence of a few cases of Cholera at Southampton and Epping, in the Autumn, produced some alarm, lest the disease should reach the Metropolis and this Parish." 30 Every year a few deaths are registered as arising from Cholera, in this Parish; the numbers for the preceding 6 years having been 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, and 7, respectively. But during the year 1866 the disease prevailed extensively in the Metropolis, and this Parish had its share. The Cholera appeared epidemically in the Metropolis in the beginning of July. The first death occurred in this Parish, in one of the best houses and well tenanted, on the 30th June. It was attributed to English Cholera, and on inspection nothing was found amiss about the house and premises. On the issuing of the "Order in Council," dated July 21st, 1866, the Sanitary Committee was summoned to carry out its provisions. The first meeting took place on July 30th. The meetings were held three times a week for four weeks; subsequently twice and once a week, as occasion required; the total number of meetings being 33. The first proceeding consisted in issuing letters of request to the legally qualified medical practitioners, and printed forms to be filled up and sent to the Vestry, to acquaint them of the presence of Cholera or severe Diarrhoea in the Parish, and of its locality. These forms were not very satisfactorily returned. In some cases they were made once or twice only, and with the exception of the medical visitors, and one or two others, they were extremely incomplete; so that the total of cases recorded by no means represents accurately the cases which occurred. At the same time, Medical Visitors were appointed; of these there were four, spread over the district. To them were given the powers required by the Order in Council:—to provide assistants, if necessary; to visit infected places, and to supply medicines and attend all cases of Diarrhoea or Cholera which might come under their notice; to report nuisances; to communicate with the Relieving Officers in cases requiring relief; to administer any relief immediately required, and to provide proper accommodation for these having no home. Six Dispensaries were open day and night, to supply medicines and disinfectants; and more than 2200 persons received medical relief from them. Where cases of Cholera were known to have occurred, the localities were inspected, always by myself—mostly by the Medical Visitors; and proper means were taken to cleanse the premises, disinfectants being ordered, and supplied gratis to disinfect the premises, the discharges, the bedding, clothing, &c. 31 At the same time, handbills and placards were posted throughout the district, stating who the Medical Visitors were, the localities of the Dispensaries, with precautionary advice. The urinals were flushed daily; the gullies covered with disinfectants; the common privies in the courts where the disease prevailed were also disinfected. On application, the New River Company kindly supplied the most populous courts with water on Sundays. The public pumps were locked. Of disinfectants, 42 cwt. 3 qrs. of Chloride of Lime; 40 gallons of Carbolic Acid; and half a ton of Mc Dougall's Powder were consumed in the Parish. Arrangements were made with the authorities of the Royal Free Hospital to receive, at a fixed sum, cases of Cholera which might be sent to them from the worst courts or dwellings; and several were sent. Some were also sent to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. A special conveyance was engaged to be kept for the transport of patients to these hospitals. An undertaker was appointed to remove and bury immediately the corpses of those whose means were insufficient for the purpose. When a patient had died, in addition to the cleansing and disinfecting of the apartments, the clothes, bedding, &c., were examined, and those which were soiled, or had been near the body, were destroyed; the Sanitary Committee replacing them, either by money or material. In several cases the beds were burnt in the public streets, saltpetre being sprinkled upon them to aid combustion, and to destroy contagious matter. Later in the course of the epidemic, the beds, &c., to be burnt were conveyed in a truck to the furnace of a large iron foundry, and burnt after the workmen had left the premises. At the meetings of the Sanitary Committee the state of prevalence of the Cholera in the district was considered; the Medical Visitors attending and reporting cases and nuisances; and the Medical Officer and the Inspectors reported upon the progress of the removal of nuisances, &c. At these meetings also, the Sanitary Committee decided upon the replacement of the beds, &c., destroyed; unless in cases of emergency, when this was done by the Vestry Clerk. 32 Of the Sanitary Staff, one Medical Visitor suffered severely from Choleraic Diarrhœa, being confined to his bed for a week; and one of the men engaged in burning the beds suffered from Choleraic Diarrhoea (three weeks), and secondary Fever (four weeks).

(Barthlmws.) c 34 The appended Table shews the number of cases returned to the Vestry during the prevalence of the epidemic. It will be noticed that, in some of the weeks, the number of deaths exceeds the number of cases; this arises from the cases having been reported by the Medical Visitors orally, or from the cases not havinsr been reported. In several instances, the knowledge that a patient had died of the disease, was derived from the most valuable "Daily Returns" of the Registrar General:— No. of Week 31 Aug. 4 32 Aug. 11 33 Aug. 18 34 Aug. 25 35 Sep. 1 36 Sep. 8 37 Sep. 15 38 Sep. 22 Cases.

It may be remarked here, that Choleraic Diarrhoea, although unquestionably a form of Cholera, differs from the typical form of the disease by its less malignant severity, and the presence of color in the evacuations; whereas in the true form the evacuations resemble rice-water, the collapse is extreme, and the disease very rapidly fatal. 35 Of these 72 deaths, 56 are registered as arising from Cholera, and 16 from Choleraic Diarrhoea. 45 of the deaths occurred in the Parish; 27 after removal to the Hospitals. As regards ages, the deaths may be arranged thus:— Under 5 years 14 Between 5 and 10 years „ 10 „ 20 „ „ 20 „ 40 „ „ 40 „ 60 „ Above 60 years 5 5 21 17 10 72 In regard to districts, the deaths occurred as follows; the deaths which took place in the two previous epidemics of 1849 and 1854 being appended:— 1866 1849 1854 St. James's 38 53 24 Amwell 13 17 15 Pentonville 9 29 8 Goswell 12 22 11 72 121 58 Of the 38 deaths occurring in the St. James's District, 10 took place in the courts of Turnmill Street, viz.: 2 in Rose Alley, 2, in Bitt Alley, and 6 in Broad Yard. As regards the localities in which the cases of Cholera occurred in this Parish, it may be remarked that they were mostly scattered; in few instances only were they centred round a spot. In the greater proportion of the cases, where Cholera occurred in a house, the sufferers lived on the first and second floors, while those on the ground floor escaped. In a few cases there were grounds for believing that the disease was imported from the East End of London, where it raged so fearfully. The first case that occurred in Eagle Court was that of a young woman, who nearly died, and had been living at Whitechapel. The mother subsequently took the disease, and died, the father and a brother being next affected and recovering. Two other fatal cases afterwards occurred in the same locality, which is densely crowded and very unhealthy. In the outbreak in c 2 80 St. Helena Place, which is a long, narrow, and overcrowded street, and where 6 deaths occurred, the disease began at a coal-shed, where vegetables were sold. These were kept in a yard, which was badly paved, with an open offensive privy and an open drain. The disease spread to the two next houses, and some cases occurred in two other houses on the opposite side of the street, but all pretty near together. The probability is that the Cholera evacuations were emptied into the yard,and splashed over the vegetables, which thus conveyed the disease to the neighbouring customers. One instance is worth special notice: a clockmaker went to a house where some nurses lived who attended upon Cholera patients; soon afterwards his wife was attacked and died, and subsequently his sister, who temporarily resided there—he himself escaping. The preponderance of evidence is in favor of the idea, that the Cholera is propagated by a person taking with his drink or food the matter composing the vomit or intestinal discharges of a patient suffering from the disease. Hence the great importance of destroying or decomposing by disinfectants every trace of these matters, and of extreme care in protecting the drink water or food from any possible contamination with them. The importance of attending to the purity of water is generally admitted; but we have but little control over the manner in which the fruit, vegetables, and fish, so largely distributed by the costermongers to the poorer classes, are kept—mostly in very small backyards, in close proximity to closets where there is no water, and where the slops are carelessly thrown. It might be argued that cooking will destroy the poison; but there is no doubt that the slight and imperfect boiling to which these provisions are subjected is inefficient for the purpose. The last case which occurred in the Parish, was that of a man who went to Petticoat Lane, and in good health. He partook freely of mussels at a stall in the street, came home, and died of Cholera within 24 hours. In one visitation to a house where there were two cases of Cholera, I found some washed clothes hung to dry on the margin of a water-butt, which had no lid! The courts in Turnmill Street, as I have stated, yielded just l-7th of the entire mortality from Cholera; the population being about 450. The inhabitants are mostly costermongers, and "roughs" in their habits. Many of the houses are realty not fit for human habitation, being very small and dark, and the courts very narrow, without back ventilations. Horses and 37 donkeys are kept there. The privies have, until quite recently, been at the rate of 1 to 58 inhabitants; now they are 1 to 36 inhabitants. They are untrapped, and without water; for if trapped they become at once stopped up, and the metal parts of the water-supply apparatus are soon stolen and taken to the rag-shops. The drain traps suffer the same fate. As the privies are at a distance from most of the houses, the slops are thrown upon the foot-way, which they keep in a wet and foul state, being mixed up with the refuse of vegetables. In most of the instances, which were isolated and scattered, the poison of the disease had been imbibed and brought home by the sufferers; nothing particular being observable about the houses or apartments, beyond the general want of attention to cleanliness which is so often found among the poorer classes. So far we have considered the Cholera in regard to the District of Clerkenwell; we will now see how the mortality which occurred there stands in comparison with that of other districts of the Metropolis. In the subjoined Table, the proportion of deaths to every 10,000 persons living is given, with the absolute number of deaths in each District. Deaths per 10,000. No. of Deaths. Hampstead 0.8 2 St. George, Hanover Square 1.6 15 Newington 2.6 24 Marylebone 2.9 46 Chelsea 3.5 23 Kensington 3.7 84 St. Martin's in the Fields 4.2 9 Islington 4.4 86 St. James, Westminster 4.4 15 Wandsworth 4.9 41 London City 5.3 21 Bermondsey 5.6 36 Holborn 5.6 24 Camberwell 5.9 48 St. Pancras 6.0 127 Lewisham 6.1 55 Westminster 6.2 42 Lambeth 6.5 113 Strand 6.8 28 St. George, Southwark 7.0 40 St. Saviour 7.4 27 38  Deaths per 10,000.

No doubt its proximity to the mainly infected districts had an important influence upon the diffusion of the disease; and this is borne out by the few instances in which the disease settled itself in any particular locality. Great thanks are, however, due to the gentlemen who honorarily and so arduously performed the duties of members of the Sanitary Committee; for without their services, especially in regard to the courts and poorer dwellings, where the sanitary apparatus is almost necessarily defective, the disease must assuredly have fallen more severely upon the inhabitants. The duties of the Medical Staff were rewarded by a gift of money. Sanitary Act. The year has been fertile in producing this important Act, which imposes new duties and gives new powers to the Vestry. The 27th and 28th Sections require the especial attention of the Vestry, but no action has as yet been taken upon it. The 27th says, "Any nuisance-authority may provide a proper place for the reception of dead bodies, and where such place has been provided, and any dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, or any dead body which is in such state as to endanger the health of the inmates of the same house or room is retained in such house or room, any justice may, on a 39 certificate signed by a legally qualified medical practitioner, order the body to be removed to such proper place of reception, at the cost of the nuisance-authority, and direct the same to be buried within a time to be limited in such order, &c." The 28th Section says, "Any nuisance-authority may provide a proper place (otherwise than at a Workhouse or Mortuary House, as lastly hereinbefore provided for) for the reception of dead bodies for and during the time required to conduct a postmortem examination ordered by the Coroner of the District, &c." The importance of using the powers thus given to the Vestry need scarcely be dwelt upon; yet I cannot refrain from re-printing an extract from my Report to the Vestry in 1856:— ''A question requiring very serious attention arises in connection with the occupation by a family of a single room only. If a poor man gets married, he is pretty sure to have a large family of children; and at the present rate of mortality of children from Zymotic diseases, several will die of these maladies. Hence, when a death occurs, the living and the dead must be together in the same room; the living must eat, drink, and sleep beside a decomposing corpse; and this in usually a small, ill-ventilated room, over-heated by a fire required for cooking, and already filled with the foul emanations from the bodies of the living and their impure clothes. This is an everyday occurrence in Clerkenwell, and constitutes a formidable evil; for what can be more calculated to drown the finer feelings of human nature, to harden the heart, and to favor deeds of violence and even murder, than this bringing up of childhood and youth in the immediate presence of the dead ? These fearful occurrences could scarcely be avoided even by preventing a family from occupying a single room; but they might, by insisting that no corpse shall be kept in an occupied dwelling room, and erecting a small mausoleum in which the dead might be safely deposited until the time for burial might arrive." In regard to this matter, we are in the same state as eleven years ago; and it is a terrible sight to witness these conditions even under ordinary circumstances; still more so in the face of an epidemic, as of Cholera, Typhus, or Small Pox. Slaughter-houses. The slaughter-houses were duly inspected in the Autumn of the year; the results of the inspection, however, do not require special comment. Bakehouses. The bakehouses were not inspected during the year, the Sanitary Committee being so much engaged at the usual period of visitation, with business relating to the 40 epidemic of Cholera. (They were, however, inspected in the spring of this year.) Cow-houses. The cow-houses were inspected as usual. In granting the licences, the Magistrates decided upon acting on the rule that 1000 cubic feet of space should be provided for each cow. It may be well to give a list of the Cow-houses, with the number of cows kept in them in 1864 (the year before the cattle plague broke out), and the number allowed by the order of the Magistrates.
