S., D. P. H., Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHORED1TCH IN THE COUNTY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1961 BY B. BROADBENT, M. A., M. B., M.R.C. S., D. P. H., Medical Officer of Health. Printed by WATERLOW & SONS LIMITED. S.S. 7440 2. To the MAYOR, ALDERMEN and COUNCILLORS of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF SHOREDITCH. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, In recent years it has been noticeable that the sun shines more brightly in Shoreditch, so that the bus conductor who announced "Shoreditch Garden Suburb" on arrival at the terminus near Shoreditch Church did not sound quite so facetious as would have been the case in December 19521 However, the Borough Council is determined to help still further, by compressing the smoke control programme into a shorter space of time, and thus having the whole Borough controlled by 1965 at latest: the London County Council is helping in the eastern part of the Borough by creating Haggerston Park, but is not helping the more overcrowded western part of the Borough: the Census of l$6l shows a 10% reduction in the population since 1951, ao that, once we leave the noisy congested roads, we should breathe more easily. Even on the roads, this Department has been making its contribution by sending about 250 letters to owners of vehicles passing through and emitting excessive fumes.(p.4l) The vital statistics of the Borough have been very satisfactory for everything except the number of deaths from tuberculosis which have relapsed to the pre-1956 levels. Admittedly the victims were all over 45 years of age, and mostly over 65, but this slip back is disconcerting, especially as the habit of spitting on pavements appears to be on the increase again, despite the placing of notices at strategic points in the Borough (The Health Department has plenty of these available to any employer or property-owner in the Borough if they will apply to me.) Apart from 1961 being a "measles year", our notifications of infectious diseases have never been better, for we not only had no cases of puerperal sepsis (and certainly not a maternal death), but we had not a single case of polio, diphtheria or any of the other crippling diseases - even dysentery was down from 109 in i960 to a mere 7 in 1961. As will be seen by a glimpse at the staff (page 5), 1961 has been the most difficult year in our whole history for public health inspectors, for, after the retirement of Mr. Gibbs (who had been here almost from childhood and finally reached 60), the last straw broke with the resignation of Mr. Lambden, the deputy chief. This left us with a mere skeleton of three inspectors none of whom had their 'meat and other foods certificate1, and our new smoke inspector to support Mr. Marshall. Each one had fortunately been provided with a portable dictation machine which he could take with him on his district, so that none had any clerical work, but, even so, they were not capable of holding the fort alone, so, in desperation, the Council appealed for permission to engage 3 senior supervisory officers instead of 1 deputy, and this gives hope for 1962. All credit must be given to the depleted staff of inspectors, and to the two trainees who perhaps obtained more practical, if less theoretical, training at that time, for they pursued the Noise Abatement Act prosecutions as well as preventing a complete collapse of other services. This has meant 3. overtime work in the evenings with regard to ice cream vendors, hut has removed the many complaints hitherto received. The Social Welfare Services continued to widen their circle of activities as shown on pages 20 - 22, and, as with details of sanitary circumstances, cover too widespread a field to detail here. Suffice it to say that despite difficulties, they are still proving their worth. When I first came to work in Shoreditch, all difficult superannuation examinations were sent to Dr. Kenneth Harris of Harley St., and this continued most amicably until the Council decided that I could perform this function in 1961. This I am pleased to do, though at times it is an invidious task while working in the midst of the "victim's" friends. Similarly, superannuation examinations for manual staff were formerly done by Dr. Taylor of City Road, and these I now do. The new function of medical referee for judging those worthy of exemption from parking-meter fees naturally falls to me, so that the Council now have all their medical matters dealt with by the one person - which may or may not be wise. It is now five years since my research into causes of coronary thrombosis began (choosing only those certified by the Coroner), and I feel that the remarks made last year in this report remain as near the truth as anyone has yet attained. It is only just over one year ago since I initiated my research into cancer of the lung, and although I have the same number of records already as for coronary thrombosis, the only firm conclusion seems to be that every one smoked cigarettes until a year or so before death, though some ceased latterly. The method or type smoked covered every range of possibility, and there was certainly no evidence of any other physical cause found. I would like to thank all the relatives who have helped me so willingly during their period of trouble, and to let them know how much I appreciate their assistance. To conclude, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank all of you with whom the department has had contact, for your courtesy and cooperation, and would wish especially to thank every member of the department for his or her intense loyalty and help given to me. Yours faithfully, B. BROADBENT. Medical Officer of Health. Shoreditch Town Hall, Old Street, E.C.I. SH0reditch 7600. 4.

The Registrar-General's estimate for the mid-year 1961 population was 40,530, and decrease of 2,340 on the previous year. This figure is used for statistical purposes throughout this report. The density of the population is 61 persons per acre. The Area Comparability Factors for the Borough are Births 0.94 and Deaths 0.90, and the rates shown in this report have been adjusted accordingly. BIRTHS. The number of registered live births allocated to the Borough during the calendar year I96I were as follows Total live births - (legitimate and illegitimate) Males 354 Females 329 Total 683 Illegitimate live births - Males 31 Females 28 Total 59 The birth rate for the Borough was 15.83. For England and Wales the rate was 17.4 and for London 18.7. The illegitimate births represented 8.64 per cent of all births in the borough. STILLBIRTHS. The number of registered stillbirths allocated to the borough was 11, or 1.58 per cent of all births. MARRIAGES. The number of marriages during the year was 384 and the marriage rate was 18.9 per 1,000 population* The marriage rate for the Metropolis was 21.1 and that for England and Wales 15.0. DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the borough in 1961 was - 524 Transferable deaths - Non-residents registered in Shoreditch - 199 Shoreditch residents registered elsewhere - 191 The number of deaths allocated to the borough is therefore - 516. This gives a death rate for the borough of 11.46 compared with 12.0 for England and Wales, and 11.9 for London. In connection with these deaths 17 inquests were held. 394 or 76 per cent of the people belonging to Shoreditch who died during the year, died in hospital. The table on page 8 showing causes of death at all ages has been supplied by the Registrar-General. 10. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of infants under one year numbered 18 of which 13 were males. These deaths amounted to 3.45 per cent of the total net Shoreditch deaths from all causes, as compared with 2.73 per cent in 1960. The infantile mortality rate (death rate of infants under one year per 1,000 live births) for Shoredit was 26.35, the rate for England and Wales being 21.6 and that for London 21.5 Two illegitimate infants died. The number of deaths of infants under 4 weeks of age was 14, which gives a neo-natal rate of 20.49.

CANCER. The deaths from cancer in the borough during the year numbered 78 as compared with 114 in 1960. COMPULSORY REMOVAL OF AGED AND INFIRM PERSONS. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council are empowered to apply to the Court for an Order for the removal to hospital or other institution of a person who is aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, and who is living in insanitary conditions and "unable to devote to himself, and is not receiving from other persons proper care and attention". In addition, during 1951, the National Assistance (Amendment) Act came into force. Under this Act, on certification by the Medical Officer of Health and another practitioner, emergency removals of such people for periods not exceeding three weeks may be enforced by the Courts. No action under this Section was necessary during the year. BURIAL OF THE DEAD. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Borough Council is responsible for arranging for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or been found dead in their area, and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. During the year 4 burials were carried out. The Council have not yet carried out any cremations, as although it may appear at the time of death that there are no surviving relatives, there is always the remote possibility that at some future date, one may come forward and start enquiries which might result in the Council's action being disputed. III - INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. During the year 753 notifications of infectious disease were received but in three cases diagnosis was revised after examination of the patients in hospital. SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION. No case of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year and no vaccinations were performed by the Medical Officer of Health under the Public Health (Smallpox Prevention) Regulations, 1917. 12.

PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS I925. These regulations prohibit a person suffering from tuberculosis, and who is in an infectious condition, from following any employment or occupation in connection with a dairy which would involve the milking of cows, the treatment of milk, or the handling of vessels used for containing milk. No formal action was necessary during the year. 17. LASS MINIATURE RADIOGRAPHY I am indebted, to Dr. Thompson, Medical Director of Unit 6D for the following report "Introduction During 1961 the Unit examined 43,004 males and 23,569 females, making a total of 66,573. Up to the end of 1961 the Unit has examined 412,361 males and 279,676 females - making a grand total of 692,037 since it commenced operations in May 1950. Fifty-four cases with a significant tuberculous lesion have been discovered which gives an overall rate of .83 per 1,000 examinees. Seventeen cases of carcinoma of the lung (l6 men and 1 woman) were discovered during the year. These results are slightly lower than for previous years. The highest incidence of tubercle was discovered in men between the ages of 45 - 54, with those between the ages of 25 - 34 and 55 - 59 running them very close. The greatest incidence in women was found in the 25 - 34 Age Group. The zone of the Unit has remained the City of London, and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch. The unit operated for about eight months during the year at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20 Golden Lane, E.C.I, while for the remaining period (excluding a three week period for annual leave) the Unit visited various firms and organisations within its zone, including a co-operative Survey at the Geffrye Museum, Kingsland Road, E.2. - by kind permission of the Museum's Curator, Mrs.M. Harrison - for the benefit of Shoreditch firms unable to attend the Mass Radiography Centre. About one hundred and twenty firms participated in this Survey. Whenever the Unit visits a firm permission is usually sought and granted for firms in the vicinity to participate, thus when the Unit operated on the premises of Associated Newspapers a large number of firms unconnected with Associated Newspapers were also X-rayed to the general benefit of all concerned. New firms are continually being added to the Unit's Register, and the demand for our services is on the increase. Doctors' Referrals Not so many General Practitioners use the Unit's services as one would wish or expect even though they are fully advised of the Unit's movements. Doctor's cases however have produced an incident rate of 11.56 per 1,000 examined. Medical Procedure As has been our practice in the past abnormal cases (after an interview with the Medical Director) are referred through the examinee's own.dactor to the appropriate Chest Clinic. Clinics have recorded their sputum findings and twenty-one cases with a positive sputum have been reported of which 14 were male and 7 female. Cases outside the purview of a Chest Clinic have been referred to St. Bartholomew1s Hospital and I gratefully acknowledge the willing co-operation offered by Dr. N.C, Oswald and Dr. Graham Hayward and their colleagues. Conclusion During the year under review there were several changes in the clerical staff. I gratefully acknowledge the loyalty and conscientiousness of all members of the staff. 18. It is a pleasure to report the continuing friendly relationships which exist between the Unit and Dr.J. Greenwood Wilson, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, and the Medical Officers of Health for the Boroughs of Finsbury and Shoreditch, and the Divisional Medical Officers in Divisions 3, 4 and 5. I am also most grateful for the great assistance rendered at all times by the Central Group Hospital Management Committee and the Regional Hospital Board.

SHOREDITCH TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE I am grateful to Miss M.D. Nutt, the Acting Secretary for the following report of Care Work from January 1961 to March 1962. "Members of Care Committee. Councillor Mr. F.G. Aldred (Chairman) Miss R. Glennie, (Vice-Chairman) Shoreditch Borough Council Soldiers', Sailors' & Airmens' Families Association, Dr. B. Broadbent, Medical Officer of Health, Shoreditch. Mrs. W.G. Dibble, Women's Voluntary Services. Miss J. Lamport Smith, Almoner, St. Leonard's Hospital. Dr. S. King, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council. Miss M.W. Sweeney, Superintendent - Shoreditch & Bethnal Green District Nursing Association. Rev. Meredith Davies, L.C.C. Divisional Health Committee Ex Officio: Dr. W.F. Richards, Chest Physician. Miss M.D. Nutt, Health Visitor. Miss E. Fletcher, Health Visitor. The work of the Care Committee continued, to be the alleviation of the stress which so often occurs in families where there is a case of tuberculosis and after-care of patients with non-tuberculous chest conditions is increasing. The statutory services were called on to a large extent, the National Assistance Board were concerned with cash payments and the London County Council for other services - recuperative holidays, home help service, extra nourishment, and the boarding out of T.B. contacts. Voluntary Societies gave an enormous amount of immediate and willing help, not only to T.B. patients but to necessitous cases with other chest conditions. We would like to thank especially, The Soldiers', Sailors' & Airmens' Families Association, Forces Help Society, Glasspool Trust, Shaftesbury Society, as well as others, for generosity in their response to our requests. The bulk of our income was as usual, from the Seal Sale,,although this is unfortunately decreasing every year. The calls made on the Fund are as numerous as ever, and include clothing, fares to enable visits to be made to hospitals and sanatoria, wireless for the lonely and housebound, and some hire purchase repayments. 20. The net result of the Seal Sale was £117.12.3d. (after of the net profit has been allotted to the Chest & Heart Association) Other donations included - Sunday Cinema Fund £40. St. Leonard's United Charities £10. The year was marred by the accidental death of Miss E.B. Guest, in January 1962. As Secretary of the Care Committee and Care Organiser, she had worked in the Shoreditch Chest Clinic for sixteen years, and had been a friend and helper to all our patients in bhoreditch and S.W. .iackney. Miss Guest is sadly missed, and it is hoped that a perpetual plaque may be arranged in her memory." SOCIAL WELFARE SERVICES. All services to old people continued unabated the good work they have now been doing for many years. Perhaps the principal change was the conversion of the Haggerston Old People's Club from part-time to full-time working, so that we have at last provided for the old folk in each quarter of the Borough, a home from home where they can live, if necessary, from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. each Monday to Friday inclusive and obtain every necessity or pleasure available at less than cost price. The main reason for a home of their own is for sleeping; and many of them do just this during the winter months. The special club concert given at Hoxton Hall each Friday, with the help of members of the Concert Artistes' Association, continues to attract full houses, and every seaside or country outing is always fully booked - not to mention the pantomines, annual Xmas dinners and so forth. In other words, there is no excuse for a pensioner in this Borough to feel lonely, starve or be short of any reasonable need. The Council's Holiday Home, despite vicissitudes following Miss Stacey's retirement as Matron after 30 years with Shoreditch folk, has continued to serve people from both the Borough of Shoreditch and from the whole area served by King Edward's Hospital Fund. Daily abjut 100 "meals on wheels" continued to be served at Clubs and (by W.V.S. and Salvation Army) to homebound folk each Monday to Friday, the price remaining at lOd. despite increased costs. Countless other services were rendered, particularly by our three lady visitors, who again topped the 4000 mark with their visits. A reasonably comprehensive list of amenities provided directly by the 21. Borough Council, through my department for old people in the Borough includes free baths, free chiropody (though 4/- at home), clubs (full and part-time) with almost every amenity, home visiting (twice annually to every pensioner by one visitor, and for emergencies, etc. by one of the three visitors), assisted holidays, free laundry facilities for the incontinent, 10d. mid-day two-course meals both at clubs and for the homebound (22,000 in all), provision of bedding, clothing, furniture, etc. where needed, Christmas parcels (670), Christmas dinner (and 2 weeks at Copthorne for 46, as well as Club dinner for 400), Church Service at St. Paul's Cathedral, clothes mending at one club, redecorating of premises, entertainments, talent competition, exhibition of handicraft? (and annual sale of work also), assistance with fuel, Harvest festival gifts distribution, home nursing requisites (including 20 wheel chairs), library books delivered to housebound, assistance with ophthalmic and dental services where needed, lowering of gas and electric meters where needed, a regular shoe repair service (free, by Lion Boys' Club) S.O.S. cards for pensioners living alone, summer outings for both active and housebound groups, various goods at reduced prices or free, wireless for the bedridden, legal aid assistance (which will be extended further when the new Citizen's Advice Bureau opens this year) - and in fact other help such as collection of pensions for housebound and almost every possible assistance in any form of difficulty. Birthday cards and Christmas cards are sent to all club members, even if in hospital at the time. Since 1953 a register of all known pensioners has been kept and has remained fairly constant at about 4,000, despite the fact that we are p.ble to keep up-to-date on all deaths and removals, while at the same time not receiving information of new pensioners unless and until they need help (or unless they are discovered during the routine street-by-street six monthly visits to the whole Borough). In addition to these services, and in very close liaison with our own welfare visitors, the pensioners receive a great deal of help from the District Nursing Association, the L.C.C. Home Helps Service (incidentally, by local arrangement the L.C.C. Health Visitors pass on to our visitors any old age pensioners who apply to them for help), the staff of St. Matthew's (geriatric) Hospital, and of course the National Assistance Board. We have appreciated the help given by the W.V.S. and Salvation Army in distributing meals-on-wheels in Council-owned vehicles, and we are indebted to King Edward's Hospital Fund for their annual maintenance payment of £300 towards the running of the Holiday Home, as well as to the City of London and East London Dispensary Fund for £250 towards the salary of the full-time visitor. 22. The number of persons who attended the Shoreditch Holiday and Rest Home at Copthorne during 1961 were as follows:- Adults 209 10-18 years 34 3—10 years 106 9 months - 5 years 170 Under 9 months 30 Old Age Pensioners 237 Conference members — Total 786 The following table shows the average attendances at the Old People's Clubs during the year (1) Old People's Clubs (2) Average number of attendances (3) Av. weekly No. of Mon.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES In enumerating the work of the Public Health Inspectors, one is veryconscious of the amount of vital work which has not been effectively carried out during the year, due to circumstances beyond their control. Over the last few years, due to retirement, the number of the older and more experienced type of Public Health Inspectors has gradually diminished. Resignations of the younger type of Public Health Inspectors, trained in the Department, having accepted more lucrative appointments outside the Central London Area shortly after qualifying, further reduced the Inspectorial staff. The staff was further depleted by the resignation of the Deputy Chief Public Health Inspector in November this year who gained a more lucrative appointment outside Local Government. These depletions so severely reduced staff, that essential basic routine inspections of premises, the very foundation of the Public Health Inspector's work, suffered to such a degree that it was almost impossible to cope with work other than matters of immediate urgency. Fortunately no serious Public Health problems presented themselves during the year, and this may be more by good luck than good management. Undoubtedly this reflects credit on the occupiers and owners of business and commercial premises, particularly food premises. Therefore, in reading this Report one must bear in mind these facts, and whilst no apology is needed for having to neglect routine work, one must congratulate the ever changing and depleted staff on the result of the year's work. Mechanical Aids increase production. During the year three portable dictation machines and one office dictation machine were employed in the Department. The result has been to literally reduce the amount of clerical work of the Public Health Inspectors to almost nil, for all outside surveys, all letters, memoranda, Notices, daily diaries etc., are now dictated directly on to tape. By employing these mechanical aids and reducing the Public Health Inspectors' paper work to a minimum, at least fifty per cent more of their time is spent on technical surveys and their specialised technical knowledge is employed to capacity. This greater output of work by the Public Health Inspectors has naturally increased the amount of work of the clerical staff. And, it may be, that as this work increases, which undoubtedly it will, the clerical staff must be augmented. 24 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES (Contd.) The employment of dictation machines in the Department has not only enabled more profitable use to be made of the specialised knowledge of Public Health Inspectors, but has reduced the need for shorthand typists in the Department, providing more scope for the employment of non-shorthand typists. Basic Routine Inspection programme. A properly programmed inspection of all business and commercial premises within the Borough cannot efficiently be undertaken, unless simple and speedy means are devised to control this programme. A great deal of consideration has been given to this important work, with the result, that there is now employed in the Department, under the control of the Chief Public Health Inspector, a modern punched card system controlling basic routine inspections. This was not introduced until the latter part of the year and there can be little doubt already as to its value. The result of efforts made to recruit experienced Public Health Inspectors. To return to staff matters and to strike a happier note for the future, for the first time in many years there will be a full staff of Public Health Inspectors as from 1st January 1962. Towards the end of I96I the Council, determined that the serious situation which had arisen because of the serious shortage of Public Health Inspectors could not be tolerated any longer, decided to alter the establishment and the salary grades and advertise for three senior Supervisory Inspectors and one senior Pood Inspector. Ultimately they advertised, and from thirteen applicants, suitable candidates were appointed. This is perhaps one of the most significant items to record in this year's Annual Report. The reduction of atmospheric pollution. The appointment of a Smoke Control Officer in the Department in July this year, gave added impetus to the Smoke Control Programme which is now well on the way and gradually gaining momentum. If the present rate of progress is continued, and as we sincerely hope the present complicated requirements of the Ministry are curtailed, the whole of Shoreditch will be declared to be Smoke Controlled within the next three or four years. The pollution of the atmosphere from the exhausts of motor vehicles in a very busy Central London Borough such as Shoreditch, has given rise to much concern. 25. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES (Contd.) Accordingly, a great deal of work has been done during the year in connection with this subject, and it is a pleasure to report in detail later in this Annual Report, of the co-operation received from owners of commercial vehicles, in an effort to reduce this type of atmospheric pollution. The result of increase in daytime population. Vacant sites, so popularly used as dumping grounds are gradually disappearing, particularly in the Moorfields Ward of the Borough, and large blocks of new offices and factories are taking their places. As one difficult problem decreases so another increases, is a maxim usually accepted. This is particularly applicable to the daytime population in Shoreditch, fof as new factories and offices are erected, so, more people are attracted into the Borough in search of employment. This added influx of daytime population, automatically increases all the duties of Public Health Inspectors in factories, offices, food premises, public houses, and even in hairdressing establishments. When the Offices Act becomes law, there can be no doubt that the volume of the work of the Department in administering the Act and any Regulations made under the Act, will be increased considerably, and consequently, consideration may have to be given in the near future to increasing the establishment of Public Health Inspectors to carry out the duties associated with this important work. Parking of vehicles creates Public Health nuisances. Parking meters have been established in this Borough, and whilst the busy central parts of the Borough have undoubtedly been relieved of congestion, a new Public Health problem has been established. Unfortunately, there are still quite a number of occupied basements in Shoreditch and the parking of large commercial and other vehicles in narrow streets, and at times only a few feet away from the frontages of houses, overshadows the lower rooms of dwellings to such an extent, so as to very seriously reduce the standard of natural lighting. This is a real problem, and so far no solution can be found, but it is suggested that many other similar boroughs may be experiencing this problem and that very serious consideration should be exercised concerning this matter. 26. SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES (Contd.) Housing Act 1961. The Housing Act I96I which became operative towards the end of the year is undoubtedly an invaluable asset to Public Health Inspectors in-so-far as the control of houses let in multiple occupation are concerned. The Regulations made under the Act are now in draft form and we hope will be available early in 1962. This appears to be a real step forward in legislation controlling houses let in multiple occupation and it is long overdue. At the same time, this is an important addition to the duties of Public Health Inspectors, for it will require a full survey of all premises within the Borough let in multiple occupation together with all the work involved in bringing houses let in multiple occupation up to standard. In this preamble attention has been drawn to the employment of mechanical equipment and to methods employed to make fuller use of the specialised technical abilities of Public Health Inspectors. Reference has been made to new legislation and the automatic increase in work which this will entail. The influence of increased daytime population has been referred to and a new problem concerning the reduction of natural light in premises due to the parking of commercial vehicles.In the body of this Report will be founJnore detailed information under the various headings, and in conclusion, it is with confidence that one looks forward to the coming year with the hope that we may be able to retain a full complement of Public Health Inspectors which in turn will result in a complete programme of Public Health duties being transformed into a reality for the first time for many years. PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTORS SOCIAL WORK Much of the work of the Public Health Inspectors is in tabulated form according to the Ministry's official requirements in the Annual Report, and in addition to the work so recorded, and also in addition to the duties enumerated under the various sections of this Report is a great deal of unseen, unpublicised work of a social character. The duties of a Public Health Inspector take him into all manner of places, from the dwelling to the work place, into cafes, snack bars restaurants and pubs, places of entertainment and in fact into almost every place in his district. He meets a very wide cross section of the public and many have their 27. SANITARY CIRCUI,STANCES (Contd.) problems, and through no fault of their own due to the complexity of official bodies in this modern society, often they know not where to go for advice and here the Public Health Inspector has developed the role of a walking citizens advice bureau. It is fair to say that in assisting- and offering advice to these people, a great deal of confidence is often inspired between them and the public health inspector, a factor of paramount importance in his day to day duties. This is particularly important as the Public Health Inspector is the only Statutory Officer of the Council who is entitled to enter all manner of premises on his official duties (apart from the Medical Officer of Health). These remarks apply particularly to the aged persons in the Borough, often living on their own, and the Public Health Inspector is in no small measure responsible for improving their lot, often by persuading owners and others to carry out certain works which could not possibly be enforced under legislation. Very close liaison is enjoyed between the Public Health Inspectors the Borough Welfare Officers, and. all engaged in trying to improve the lot of aged persons who may require help and assistance. 28. A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION PORTRAYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN:- (a) the minimum number of basic routine inspections required to be made monthly (with 100% establishment of Public Health Inspectors). (b) the number of basic routine inspections actually made. (c) the Public Health Inspectors actually employed shown as a percentage of the full establishment. 29. 30.

Assiduous attention has been paid by the Public Health Inspectors to the provision of proper amenities within these new commercial and industrial buildings as an insurance against the development of problems later on. In complete contrast to these modem erections, there are numerous small factories in Shoreditch trying to cram 'a quart into a pint pot* because of lack of acccmmodation. This is a very serious problem, and little can be done to encourage occupiers to provide other than the bare requirements of facilities and amenities for the staff according to the Factories Act. The standard therefore in this class of factory leaves much to be desired. A problem of major significance will be augmented under the heading of Atmospheric Pollution later in this Report, which deals with the prohibition of the burning of wood wastes in Smoke Control Areas. As the anoke Control Programme progresses in Shoreditch and the burning of wood wastes is consequently prohibited in wood working factories, unless approved appliances are provided for this purpose, the problem of providing alternative means of space heating will have to be faced. Bearing these facts in mind an approach has been made, through their Secretary, to the London and South Eastern Furniture Manufacturers Association, and very close harmony is being enjoyed with this body in an attempt to solve seme of these difficult problems. The problems of rodents and infestations in many of the older type of factories in this Borough is ever with us, but at the same time, much success is enjoyed due to the prompt action by the Council in this direction. This matter will be more amplified under the Rodent and Infestation Section of this Annual Report on page 50. 31. FACTORIES (contd.)

Again one must refer to the vast amount of what one considers to be unnecessary administrative work thrust upon the local authority Public Health Departments in respect of Outworkers. One must again repeat, that if an obligation were placed on the firms responsible fbr supplying local authorities with lists of outworkers, to notify the several authorities in which their outworkers reside, it would be to everyone's advantage, arri very much reduce the work of the clerical staff of local authorities. 208 Inspections revealed no defects necessitating the service of Sanitary Notices.

FOOD ADMINISTRATION The admini strati on of the various food legislations has been very difficult due to lack of staff, for we have been without a Food Inspector since May I960 and it was not until November 1961 that a suitable Food Inspector was found and his duties are to commence as from 1st January 1962. During the year, however, every effort has been made to cope with this important work, working under the greatest difficulties. Fortunately it has been possible to complete the programme of Routine Chemical Sampling of Foodstuffs, but it was quite impossible to carry out all the important work of Bacteriological Sampling of Foodstuffs. Effective cleansing of food utensils. Once again, it is to be regretted that provision has not been made for the effective cleansing and sterilising of food utensils in a manner similar to that as laid down for milk vessels under the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations. Under these Regulations, all milk vessels must be effectively sterilised with boiling water, or steam, or otherwise effectively cleansed with a chemical agent of a type approved by the Minister. Why we should accept a lower standard in catering establishments than in dairies one can never understand, and it is recommended that this matter should have earnest consideration in order that this unsatisfactory state of affairs may be remedied. There are 930 types of food businesses and food stalls in Shoreditch designated as follows : - Cafes and Restaurants 101 Factory, Warehouse and School Canteens 89 Ice Cream Shops 111 Butchers' Shops and Stalls 37 Milk Shops and Depots 84 Fried Fish Shops 10 Wet Fish Shops 8 Bakers 37 Bakehouses 10 Food Warehouses 12 Grocery and Provision Shops 87 Confectioners' Shops 82 Public Houses 115 Food Stalls 90 Greengrocers 31 Chemists 20 Off Licences 6 34. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (contd). The number of basic routine inspections. Number of basic routine inspections required 3,720 Number of basic routine inspections made 2,557 Number of re-inspections 222 Total number of inspections 2,779 Notices served. 25 Notices were served for breaches of the Food Hygiene Regulations during the year as follows : - Wash hand basins provided 4 Provision of hot water over sinks and wash hand basins 7 General repairs completed 8 Dirty floors cleaned, repaired etc., 5 Food preparation tables provided 2 Premises or part of premises redecorated 8 Improvements to urinals and W. C. 's 10 Cleansing of equipment 2 Cleansing of food rooms 5 Abatement of nuisance due to storage of refuse 5 Additional dust bin provided 2 Elimination of cockroach infestation 1 The traditional open shop front. Baphasis was made in last year's Annual Report as to the necessity of devoting some time to the unsatisfactory conditions prevailing at butchers shops and fish shops with the traditional open front, particularly in the Hcocton Street Market area. The appointment of a Food Specialist Inspector will enable vis to devote sufficient time to this problem in future. Food hygiene and the customer. The customer continues to play a most important role in maintaining a reasonable standard of food hygiene in food premises, and his ever increasing food consciousness is, without doubt, proving more and more, one of the most valuable assets of the Public Health Department. 35. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (contd. ) The inspection and sampling of foodstuffs. Chemical Sampling: 245 samples were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst during 1961. Details were as follows:- Ale, Beer & Stout 4 Macaroni 2 Arrowroot 1 Margarine 2 Baking Powder 2 Marmalade 2 Barley, pearl 2 Marzipan 1 Beer 3 Meat (minced) 1 Brandy 2 Meat Paste 3 Bread 1 Meat products 6 Butter 2 Medicines 2 Cake mixtures 2 Milk 91 Cheese spread 3 Milk (condensed) 1 Cocoa 1 Milk (dried) 1 Coconut, Desiccated 1 Mincaneat 1 Codeine tablets (compound) 1 Mustard 1 Coffee & Chicoiy essence 2 Oil, cooking 2 Confectionery, sugar 2 Pepper 3 Cooking fat 2 Pickles 2 Cream, sterilised 1 Pudding mixture 1 Curry powder 2 Bice, flaked 1 Drink, Soft (mineral water) 1 Rum 3 Drink, Soft (orange) 2 Salad cream 2 Drink, Soft (powder) 1 Sauce 3 Fish (canned) 3 Sausages 3 Fish cakes 1 Semolina 1 Fish paste 2 Soda, bicarbonate of 1 Flavouring essence 2 Soup, canned 2 Flour, self-raising 2 Soup, preparation 1 Fruit, dried 12 Sipice 9 Fruit curd (lemon) 1 Stout 1 Fruit, glace 2 Suet, Shredded 3 Fruit juice 1 Syrup, Golden 1 Gelatine 1 Tapioca 1 Gin 4 Tea 1 Honey 1 Vegetables, canned 1 Ice Cream 1 Vinegar 5 Jam (Gooseberry) 1 Vinegar, imitation 1 Jelly Tablet 1 Vodka 1 Lard 3 Whisky 5 Wine cocktail 2 8 were notified as being non genuine by the Public Analyst (as per schedule over). 36. POOD ADMINISTRATION (contd.) Details Results Action taken Butter Sample was rancid and affected by mould. Balance of stock withdrawn and returned to manufacturers. Sultanas - "Washed ready for use" (4) Contained sand and grit 0.14, 0.09, 0.11 and 0.13 per cent. Sultanas described as "Washed ready fbr use" should not contain sand or grit. On C.P.H.I's recommendation measures were taken by importers to obtain fruit of a higher standard of cleanliness. Samples of new stocks proved to be satisfactorily cleaned to a standard of 0.05 per cent. Vinegar (2) Samples were not vinegar but consisted of Water 99$ Acetic Acid 0.8$ Caramel colouring a small quantity. Vendor prosecuted. Pined £25 and ten guineas costs. Vinegar Consisted of a non-brewed substitute made from diluted acid with colouring and flavouring. Attention of shop-keeper drawn to offence of mis-desc ription. Later samples of both malt vinegar and condiment satisfactory. Milk Samples. After a great deal of thought, milk samples were considerably reduced during the year because of the fact that all the milk supplied in this Borough is supplied from half-a-dozen or so suppliers. 37. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (Contd. ) Bacteriological Sampling. 8 samples of foodstuffs were submitted for bacteriological examination. Details as follows : - Plans are now completed so that during next year a full programme of Bacteriological Sampling of Foodstuffs and all the necessary work in preventing cross infection in food preparing premises may be carried out. It is considered most essential that this programme should be assiduously pursued, particularly when one has regard to the vast increase in daytime population in the Borough, and the amount of food and drink which is supplied in order to satisfy their needs. It is estimated that upwards of 200,000 lunches and snacks are provided daily in the cafes, snack bars and restaurants of this Borough, and no doubt the reader may be able to imagine the amount of liquor consumed in licensed premises in this very busy Borough of Shoreditch. Details of Unsound Food: In no instance was it found necessary to seize unfit food during 1961. All unsound food in fbod premises and food stalls was voluntarily surrendered, and where possible under strict supervision, permission was granted for this to be ronoved to establishments for purposes other than for human consumption Herewith is a list of surrendered unsound foodstuffs :- Beef 4 cwt. 1 qr. 19 lbs. , Sheeps' heads 85 (3 cwt. 0 qrs. 4 lbs. ) Bacon 34 cwt. 2 qrs. 15 lbs. , Stewed steak 10 tins, Corned Beef 101 tins, Corned mutton 6 tins, Meat products 262 tins, 1 cwt.2 qrs. 17 lbs. 8 ozs. , Ham 31 tins, 11 cwt. 3 qrs.221bs. 5 ozs., Turkey 25 lbs. 6 ozs., Pigs kidneys 2 qrs., Chicken 34 lbs. 3 oz., Sausages 4 tins, Steak & kidney pudding 3 tins, Liver pate 2 lbs. 4 oz., Pigs* liver 11 lbs. 13 oz., Pork 1 cwt. 1 qr. 25 lbs. , Lamb loin 7 lbs. , Ox liver 2 qrs. 7 lbs. , Bacon pudding 15f oz., Tinned fish 15 tins, Skate 6 stone, Crab 1 lb. 4? oz. , Peas 32 tins, Tomatoes 21 tins, 21 lbs., 3 kilograms, Baked Beans 11 tins, Vegetables 6 tins, Pickles 2 jars, Tomato paste 30 tins, 38 tubes, Beetroot 11 tins, Butter 1 lb., Milk 4 tins, Pure cream 14 tins, Creamed rice 66 tins, Cheese 6 lbs. 2 oz., Chestnut puree 26 lbs. 10^ oz., Jam 7 jars, Coffee 4 tins, Tinned fruit 53 tins, 3 jars, Dried fruit 5 Its. , Fruit juice 6 tins, Fruit pulp 10 lbs., 20 kilos., Biscuits 30 packets, Chocolate 907 bars, 218 boxes, Sauce 8 bottles. 1 Pasteurised Milk - Methylene Blue test - Satisfactory Phosphatase Test - Satisfactory 3 Ice Cream - Provisional tirade I. 1 Ice Cream - Provisional Grade III. 2 tins Russian Crab - After incubation of cans for three days at 37°C. all cultures ranained sterile. 1 Gravy - Total count less than 200 cols/ml. 38. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (contd.) Complaints of foreign bodies in food. 10 complaints were made to the Department during the year and hereunder are details of the result of investigations made Complaint. Action taken. Piece of wire in sliced loaf of bread. Piece of twine in scone. Representative of bakery company interviewed. A thorough investigation carried out at the bakery, -which is modern and of a high hygienic standard, failed to trace the origin of the piece of wire. Warning letter was sent to the bakers. On investigation was found to be piece of twine used by millers to sew up mouth of sack of flour when full. Bakery is clean and well maintained. Warning given. Piece of wood in piccalilli. Appeared to be piece of wood split off inside of cask which contained mustard liquor. Bottling premises inspected by C.P.H.I. of area in which situated, and found to be clean and well conducted by working proprietor. Warning given. Piece of metal in bread roll. Bakehouse inspected and found in good hygienic condition. Baker stated that roll making machine had recently been repaired by welding and he attributed piece of metal found to be a piece of such -welding. Warning letter was sent. Cigarette end in chips. Warning letter was sent to shopkeeper but no further action was possible as there was no definite proof that the cigarette aid was in the chips at the time of sale. Spearmint wrapper in Madeira Cake. Cake was made at bakery outside London and investigation was passed to C.P.H.I. for that area. He reported that it was a large well conducted bakery, but that builders and electricians had recently been working on new plant, and had been cautioned several times about dropping litter. Filter tip from cigarette baked in bread roll. Baker denied that roll was of his manufacture, and although complainant asserts that it was purchased at his shop, she is unwilling to appear in court as witness. 39. POOD ADMINISTRATION (contd. ) Complaint. Action taken. Cigarette end baked in cut loaf of bread. Bakehouse inspected and found to be in good hygienic condition but flour was not screened during bread making. Baker could not account for cigarette end getting into bakehouse unless it had been dropped by engineers who had been working there, as his own staff were not allowed to smoke. Proceedings were taken and baker was fined £10 and three guineas costs. Wasp in cheese cake. Investigation carried out by C.P. H. I. of borough in which bakery is situated, and he reports that a high hygienic standard is maintained and that all reasonable precautions are taken. No previous complaint of this nature has been made in nearly 30 years trading. Piece of adhesive plaster in sliced loaf of bread. Investigation showed that this came from the first-aid booc in bakehouse. Warning letter was sent to baker. Seven instances of assistants in food premises found by Public Health Inspectors to be snoking whilst handling open food were reported to the Public Health Committee. In four cases warning letters were sent and the other three offenders were prosecuted, ths results being as follows : - 1 Absolute discharge on payment of two guineas costs. 1 Conditional discharge. 1 Conditional discharge on payment of three guineas costs. Once more one cannot help but regret that even after repeated efforts made by various bodies, the law still contains no effective provisions for the punishosnt of these types of offences, and one is compelled to repeat the need for early consideration to be given to this vitally important subject. Certificates of purity. No 'Certificates of Purity' for certain products exported to overseas countries were issued during the year. 40. FOOD ADMINISTRATION (contd.) Condensed Milk Regulations. One sample of condensed milk was submitted for analysis under these Regulations and conformed with the prescribed standard. Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, I960. These regulations which became operative on the 1st October, I960 amended legislation concerning the licensing of milk dealers and distributors, and now licences are valid for five years instead of requiring renewal annually. Details of licences issued during the year are as follows Pasteurised Sterilised T. T. Pasteurised T. T. (Raw Milk) Dealers' licences 75 83 32 1 Merchandise Marks Act 1926, Orders. There were no contraventions of the above Act and Orders during the year and strict observation was kept of all food premises and stalls in the Borough in relation to this subject. Pharmacy & Poisons Act 1933- 41 licences were granted during the year. 68 inspections and visits were made, and general observation was kept of stalls and shops for unauthorised sellers, but no infringements were reported. Pharmacy <fc Medicines Act 1941. Throughout the year a watch was kept fbr contraventions of this Act but none were observed. 41. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Perhaps the most significant feature of this part of the Annual Report, apart from the very encouraging progress being made with regard to the Smoke Control Area Programme, is that which refers to measures taken by the Public Health Inspectors in an effort to reduce air pollution emitted from motor vehicles. Success has been greater than we had dared to hope for at the beginning of the year. Letters have been sent to the owners of vehicles observed to be emitting an undue amount of smoke, drawing their attention to the matter and suggesting the resultant pollution may be due to faulty maintenance and operation of the vehicle. 244 such letters were sent out during the year, and no less than 55 replies have been received expressing appreciation that their attention had been drawn to the particular circumstances concerning the vehicles, often operating hundreds of miles from their bases. In almost every reply the owners informed the Depai'tment that as a result of our letter defects had been discovered and remedied. Some of the defects, as reported in these letters, are enumerated below. Defective fuel pumps 15 Defective fuel injectors 27 Complete overhaul of engine required 3 These were the main defects, and others reported were as follows:- Defective carburettor Radiator overheating Complete new engine required Oil leaking on to hot exhaust pipe Defective gaskets Defective pump seal These results are, to say the least, encouraging and a real step forward in-so-far as air pollution from motor vehicles is concerned. Undoubtedly the owners of motor vehicles welcome the information that we send to them, and it is our belief that if such measures were assiduously employed by all local authorities a major step forward would be made in reducing air pollution from this source. 42. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Contd.). Smoke Control Areas. During I96I two Smoke Control Areas were declared in Shoreditch, and on 14th March, the Shoreditch (Pitfield) Smoke Control Order was confirmed, and on 28th December, the Shoreditch (Wenlock) Smoke Order was confirmed, the former becoming operative on 1st June 1962 and the latter on 1st September 1962. Very wide publicity has been given to these pending Smoke Control Orders, in letters to occupiers and owners, in the Press, in the Shoreditch Borough Council newsletter, and on the various notice boards throughout the Borough. The Public Health Department therefore has been kept extremely busy answering the numerous enquiries made to the Department and applications for grants are already being received and investigated. The Smoke Control Programme is well up to date, and it is reasonable to estimate that, if the present rate of progress can be maintained, we shall easily fulfil the programme as planned, in fact if the complicated procedure invoked by the Ministry could be simplified, and there are indications that this may be so, there is no reason why we should not be in advance of our original planning. Modern family trends and the domestic chimney. The growing trend of the wife going out to work as well as the husband., is having an added effect in reducing pollution from the domestic chimney. Nearly half the dwellings of this Borough are believed to come under this category, and in order that those returning from work may be able to produce a comfortable fire quickly, the electric fire, the gas fire and the oil heating appliance have gradually reduced the use of solid fuel fires and automatically reduce the extent of air pollution. Recent surveys have furthermore established, that over the past two years the number of oil fired appliances have declined and given way to gas and electric fires. 43. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Contd.). The First Smoke Control Area in Shoreditch. The first Smoke Control Area in Shoreditch, on the Colville Estate has now been in operation for two years, and whilst this area is made up almost entirely of local authority flats provided with approved appliances and gas ignition, it has been established that there is a positive trend towards the use of gas and electric fires. Whilst in the early days a few offenders, were to be found, visits by the Public Health Inspector have revealed that either aged persons or those who had difficulty in understanding the law were the offenders, and a little instruction and encouragement seems to have solved the problems. During the recent year, no contraventions of the Smoke Control Order from domestic chimneys were observed in this Area. The problem of industrial smoke. The major problem of Smoke Control in this Borough is undoubtedly that of industrial smoke, produced by the occupiers of the numerous small wood working factories burning wood shavings, saw dust and other wood waste as a means of easy disposal and an economic means of space heating. Every effort has been made to obtain the full co-operation of furniture and other wood working manufacturers to secure the economical disposal of trade waste without producing unreasonable atmospheric pollution. To this end a very happy relationship has been established between the London and South Eastern Furniture Manufacturers' Association and the Public Health Department. Meetings are regularly being held and a great deal of harmony is being enjoyed in attempting to solve this very difficult problem. Every effort is being made by representatives of the local authority to assist and advise at every opportunity those who have employed the traditional methods of incineration of trade waste for many years, and are finding it extremely difficult to depart from this tradition especially when this will involve additional expenditure and no gain save that of affording cleaner air for the community. Underfeed stokers. There are several underfeed stokers in the two recently confirmed Smoke Control Areas, some belonging to the London County Council, some to the Shoreditch Borough Council and others belonging to industrial premises. It is recognised that these stokers, if provided with proper fuel, efficiently operated and maintained can comply effectively with the requirements of the Smoke Control Orders, and to this end the Public Health Inspectorate have seized eveiy opportunity, to ensure that the underfeed stokers are properly maintained and effectively operated before the Smoke Control Orders become operative in June and September 1962. 44 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION (Contd.). The valuable contributions made by Officers and Engineers of the National Coal Board in assisting Public Health Inspectors in this important work are worthy of the highest commendation. Railways. The only railway from which atmospheric pollution is likely to be produced in Shoreditch, is the Broad Street Line. The steam locomotive has disappeared from this line, and has been replaced completely by electric and diesel tractors. Consequently atmospheric pollution from this source has virtually disappeared. The measurement of atmospheric pollution. The daily measurement of atmospheric pollution by means of volumetric control method has continued throughout the year. It is, as yet, far too early to make comparisons, since no major Control Area has yet been operative in Shoreditch. Publicity and Education. The filter papers exhibiting atmospheric pollution as taken from the volumetric measuring apparatus are displayed on monthly charts in prominent positions in the Town Hall for the public to observe. This has aroused a great deal of interest, so much so that it is now intended to extend this type of publicity and arrangements are being made for similar charts to be displayed in the public libraries and other prominent places. It is our intention to impress upon the younger generation at every opportunity, the dangers of atmospheric pollution and to this end every effort is being made to persuade headmasters and others responsible to permit Public Health Inspectors to enter the schools and give talks and demonstrations on the subject. It is sincerely hoped that Educational Officers will offer every facility to Public Health Inspectors in this important duty of educating the young in the perils, the wastage and disease of air pollution. 45 46. HOUSING. Individual dwellings - Clearance Areas. The Council's housing redevelopment programme has continued with increasing momentum,most of the development taking part V of the Housing Act 1957« This has incurred the continuance of the very important work of the Public Health Inspector in tracing, and abolishing disused drains from Clearance Area sites. Mention of this important work and the very valuable insurance this work is providing in reducing the rat menace in sewers is referred to in the Section of the Annual Report RODENT CONTROL on page 50. Unfortunately routine House to House Inspection, as required under the Housing Act. has not been possible, because of tl^e depleted staff of Public Health Inspectors. As some indication of the work involved during I96I. 1 Clearance Area was resolved. 5 Compulsory Purchase Orders were confirmed involving 142 premises. 5 Demolition Orders were made. 2 Closing Orders were made. 3 Undertakings not to relet until premises were made fit, were accepted. 188 Premises were demolished. 156 New flats were completed. 485 New flats were in course of erection. 142 Routine inspections under Section 3, Housing Act, 1957. Loans and Grants. No application for loan to repair was received. 2 applications for Standard Improvement Grants were received and approved. 4 applications for Discretionary Improvement Grants were received and approved. Underground Rooms. During 1961 representations were made to the Public Health Committee resulting in:- 5 Closing Orders being made 13 undertakings being accepted not to relet until premises rendered fit 3 undertakings specifying works of repair accepted undertakings specifying works of repair not accepted 3 Underground premises made fit. 47. HOUSING (contd.) Derelict sites. Derelict sites throughout the Borough still present many problems to the Public Health Inspector but are gradually disappearing and new buildings taking their place, but as their value as parking places for cars now that parking meters are in operation in Shoreditch, has greatly increased, this is automatically keeping many sites presentable which would otherwise develop into refuse dumps. Drainage plans. All drainage plans submitted to the local authority are perused by the Public Health Inspectors before they are submitted to the appropriate committee for approval. During the year 67 plans were perused and numerous interviews have taken place with architects, builders, owners and others concerned in the works involved. Overcrowding and Preferential Treatment. At the end of 1960 the number of overcrowded cases on the Public Health Department Register was 44, and the number of cases on the Register for Preferential Treatment on medical grounds was 20. During the year 19 new cases of families living in overcrowded conditions were found and added to the register, and a survey of all premises on the register revealed that 7 families had been rehoused or had found alternative accommodation themselves. 1 case was removed from the preferential treatment register. The number of cases remaining on the overcrowding register at the end of the year therefore was 56, the number remaining- on the preferential treatment register being 19. 61 visits of inspection were made. Rent Act 1957. There has been very little work under the Rent Act 1957 during the year, and only an occasional application is now received either from a landlord or a tenant. 48. HOUSING (contd.) Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954. No applications were made to the local authority under the Housing .Repairs and Rents Act 1954 during the year. Housing Act I96I. The Housing Act 1961 received the Royal Assent on 24th October 1961 and came into operation on 24th November I96I. Part 2 of the Act amends the provisions of the Housing Act 1957 with respect to Houses in Multiple Occupation, and provides, amongst other things, for a code of management for such houses; amendments are also made in relation to condemned houses. In respect of Houses in Multiple Occupation, the Minister may, by Regulations, prescribe a code of management to ensure the condition of the following matters. fl} Water supply and drainage. (2j Kitchens, bathrooms and water closets in common use. (5) Sinks and wash basins in common use. (4) Common staircases, corridors and passage ways. (5) Outbuildings, yards and gardens in common use. (6) Refuse disposal. Local Authorities may require that such a code shall apply to any houses so let which are in an unsatisfactory state, due to failure to maintain proper standards of management, and then require the person managing such house which is defective due to failure to comply with these standards, to execute works to make good the defects. They are also empowered to require the execution of other work relating to lighting, ventilation, water supply, personal washing facilities, drainage and sanitary conveniences, facilities for storage, preparation and cooking of food, heating and means of escape from fire where these are insufficient, because of the number of persons or households accommodated in the property. The local authority also has power to limit the number of individuals who should occupy a house let in multiple occupation. Within a period of three years from the commencement of the Act a local authority may submit to the Minister a scheme authorising them to compile and maintain a Register of Houses Let in Lodgings or occupied by more than one family and buildings which comprise two or more dwellings with shared sanitary conveniences and personal washing facilities. With regard to condemned houses, the authority may now exclude from a confirmed Clearance Order, any house which has been or will be made fit 49 HOUSING (contd.) for human habitation, may revoke a demolition order where proposals are submitted for the reconstruction or improvement of the property, and where the proposals are for use other than for human habitation and make a Closing Order in lieu. Part 3 of the Act provides that the permitted increase in the rent of a controlled tenancy in respect of improvements shall be 12½% instead of 870 as previously. There are also amendments to the requirements relating to Improvement Grants and Standard Grants. Finally, in the case of a dwelling house which is let for a period of less than 7 years, there is to be an implied covenant that the landlord is to be responsible for the repair of the structure and the exterior of the premises, and also to be responsible for keeping in repair and proper working order the installations in the dwelling house as follows. (1) Water, gas and electricity supplies and sanitation and (2) for space and water heating. It is obvious that this new Housing Act has given far greater power to the local authority for the control of houses let in multiple occupation but at the same time it has increased the responsibility and the work of the Public Health Inspectorate to such an extent that consideration may have to be given to augmenting the existing staff if this work is to be done efficiently. 50 RODENT CONTROL (Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949). Throughout the year there were only 153 complaints of rodent infestations in private dwellings and 45 complaints from commercial premises. This gradual reduction in the number of complaints throughout the year is conclusive evidence that work of sealing off all disused drains carried out efficiently and effectively is a handsome insurance against rodent infestations in the future. Again one must report that surface infestations in the Shoreditch area have never been so low. The rat populations in the sewer also are at a minimum. There has been no evidence over the last year of the black rat in Shoreditch and surface infestations of the brown rat have been few and far between. So far as sewer treatments are concerned it is considered that the "residual population" is as low as one can achieve using the present poison bait, Warfarin. Some thought has been given as to how this residual population of rats in the sewers can be further reduced, and on the Ministry's recommendation plans are formulated to carry sewer treatment in 1962 using 1081 (Sodium Fluoracetate). Whilst the Ministry recommends direct poisoning with 1081 four times per year with a test bait to be laid immediately before the last application, it has been agreed with the Ministry that because of the low infestation of rats in the sewers in Shoreditch three direot poisonings may be made. It will, however, be necessary to bait 100% manholes during the year, and the result of the test baiting at the end of the last treatment will provide evidence as to the number of manholes to be treated in the following year. From the excellent results observed by the use of 1081 in neighbouring local authorities it is confidently hoped that the residual population of rats will be even further reduced in the years to come. The effective sealing of all disused drains as demolition takes place has continued in the Borough as usual, and has received assiduous attention as this is considered to be one of the most important functions of the Public Health Inspector working in close harmony with the rodent control officer as an insurance against the multiplication of rats in the sewers together with the resultant surface infestations. The relatively complete absence of surface infestations throughout the year is direct evidence that every effort made and all the time taken to ensure the effective sealing of disused drains is very well worth while. The mouse continues to be the villain of the piece in so far as factories and offices are concerned but the local authority contract scheme continues to be the most effective method of dealing with this problem. At the end of the year contracts were operative in respect of 74 premises yielding an annual income of £1,713. 37 single treatments were carried out amounting to £265. The employment of mechanical means for lifting manhole covers has proved to be entirely successful and the consequent reduction in labour costs for this work has been 50% with only an expenditure of £60 for equipment. 51 REPORT FOR PERIOD 1st JANUARY-31st DECEMBER, 1961.

No Notice was served in respect of verminous premises. 538 visits were made to premises, 174 in respect of infectious disease inquiries and 364 in respect of vermin. Articles belonging to private firms were disinfected at their request and charges amounting to £24 were made. During the year 297 families were removed to new Council dwellings as compared with 313 in i960. All furniture is subjected to Hydrogen Cyanide disinfestation and all mattresses are put through the Council's disinfector prior to removal to their new accommodation by private removal contractors under the supervision of the Officers of the Department. Prior to removal the Officers of the Department visit the premises, assess the amount of furniture to be removed, and arrange for the number of removal vans required. On the day of removal an Officer of the Department supervises the placing of all furniture in the vans and arranges for the reception of soft furniture in a room which can be securely locked until tests carried out to ensure that the furniture is clear of Hydrogen Cyanide have proved satisfactory. The problem of derelict sites and nuisances therefrom has been amplified elsewhere in this Report ( Page 47 ) and during 1961, 35 sites were sprayed to prevent" further nuisances from vermin and flies. At the request of the Public Health Inspectors 64 mattresses and other articles were removed for destruction by the Cleansing Department. The measures taken to prevent the breeding of beetles in heating ducts on new Local Authority Estates whilst in construction are a vital duty of the Public Health Inspectors. 54 DISINFECTION AID DISINFESTATION (Contd.) Personal Cleanliness. The arrangement with the Finsbury Borough Council whereby residents of Shoreditch requiring treatment for Scabies, or Vermin are sent to that Authority's Cleansing Station at Pine Street, was continued throughout the year. The numbers of treatments carried out are shown in the following tables:Verminous Persons. New Cases Total Re- Total 0 to 15 years Over 15 years new cases at tendances treatments - 2 2 2 4 Scabies. New Gases Total Re- Total 0 to 15 years Over 15 years new cases attendances treatments - 5 5 7 12 (Until school-leaving age, the L.C.C. treat all affected children at their owi Centre). 55 HAIRDRESSING ESTABLISHMENTS (London General Powers Act 1954) Total number of hairdressing establishments 55 Number of basic routine inspections (a) required to be made annually 110 (b) made in 1961 179 Number of re-inspections made in 1961 32 Total number of inspections made in 1961 211 Number of Notices served in 1961 Both barbers 'shops and ladies' hairdressing establishments seem to have been busier than ever during 1961, and no doubt this may be due to the gradual increase in daytime population. New establishments are being opened and registered by the local authority and it is considered to be one of the most important duties of a Public Health Inspector in inspecting hairdressing establishments to see that the general standard of hygiene in these premises is of the highest order. SHOPS (Shops Act 1950 and. London General Powers Act 1958) Total number of shops, wholesale establishments and warehouses subject to the requirements of the Shops Act 1950 and the London General Powers Act 801 Number of basic routine visits (a) required to be made annually 2,700 (b) made in 1961 3,229 Number of re-inspections made in 1961 361 Total number of inspections made in 1961 3,590 Number of Notices served in 1961 13 Under this legislation, inspections relate to heating, lighting, ventilation, washing facilities, sanitary accommodation and facilities for staff to take meals in shops including wholesale establishments and warehouses. Prior to the implementation of the London General Powers Act, the Council were only responsible for seeing that sufficient sanitary accommodation was provided for the staff, and these additional duties have now been imposed on us. During the year 21 applications were made and 20 certificates of exemption were granted in respect of sanitary accommodation. 1 application was refused. 56 PET ANIMALS ACT 1951. Seven premises were licensed under this Act during the year. In 5 cases a considerable business is carried on, mostly in budgerigars and goldfish, but the other two deal on a very small scale only, one in dogs and one in pigeons. During the year 15 inspections were made of these premises, and in no case were the conditions of the licence being contravened. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. General observation was kept on the sale of heating appliances to ensure that they complied with the Regulations made under the above-named Act, In several cases the sellers and users of heating appliances requested that their guards be tested. The Chief Public Health Inspector made several tests of appliances at the request of manufacturers and others in the Borough. OFFENSIVE TRADES An establishment order under Section 140, Public Health (London) Act, 1936, was renewed during the year in respect of the business of a Fur Skin Dresser. The number of visits made was 4. WELLS There are two wells in use in the Borough. In one case the water is used for washing down and cooling purposes and in the other case, which is a factory, the water from the well is used for all purposes. PUBLIC STORING BATHS Shoreditch has now only one swimming bath (indoor), built in 1904, situated in Whiston Road, Haggerston, open a11 the year round for mixed bathing at all times. (Sunday swimming from May to September only). The pool, is 100 feet long by 35 feet wide, constructed of blue and white glazed bricks, with a depth of 3 feet 4 inches at the shallow end, increasing gradually to 6 feet 4 inches at the deep end, at which there is one 3 metre fixed diving stage with 3 lower fixed boards at each side. The surround is 3 feet wide, of non-slip tiles and seats rise in tiers from the surround up to the dressing cubicles at the back. The seats which are made of teak, also form clothes lockers for use by children during peak periods. Male and female toilets and foot-baths are situated at each side of the pool at the shallow end. Entry to the pool from the dressing cubicles is via the toilets and footbaths and into the pool by teak steps fitted into each corner. The pool has a capacity of 109,000 gallons continuously filtered through pressure sand filters at the rate of 20,000 gallons per hour, chlorinated and heated to a temperature of 740F. in summer and 78°F. in winter. 57 PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS (Contd.). Chemical treatment of the pool is by Alumina Ferric and Sodium Carbonate. A Chlorine content of 1.0 to 1.5 parts per million is maintained during trade, with a P.H. value of 7.6. Back washing of filters is done by air agitation of sand and washing through to waste by M.W.B. water from a main storage tank. The pool is emptied and re-filled as conditions and analysis dictate. Cleaning of the pool sides and bottom is carried out every morning before opening and during the day as circumstances permit. During the year 18 samples of water were taken from the bath and sent for Bacteriological Examination and Chemical Analysis. Results received from both laboratories showed the water to be satisfactory in every case. RAG DEALERS. There are 4 premises in the Borough in which the business of Rag Dealer is carried out. 4 visits of inspection were made during the year. WATER SUPPLY. The water supply of the Borough is controlled by the Metropolitan Water Board and is relayed from public mains direct to premises. PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA. Health propaganda posters were posted and regularly changed from time to time on the Public Health notice boards which are fixed in positions on the Council's housing estates. There is also a large notice board situated at the Town Hall and one at St. John's Churchyard. A rack containing leaflets of various types is kept filled, at the entrance to the Department, and in addition to this, Public Health Leaflets have been distributed through the courtesy of the Borough Librarian at the Public Libraries. In-so-far as propaganda under the Clean Air Act is concerned, all occupiers and owners of properties have received Infoimation Letters and Booklets. Very wide publicity is being given to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, particularly those affecting Smoke Control Areas. All occupiers in proposed Smoke Control Areas and the Owners of the same have received relevant literature in this direction. Much success has been achieved by working in the closest possible harmony with the London and South Eastern Furniture Manufacturers Association and meetings are being arranged to address the members in order to assist them in complying with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. Reference is made to this valuable work under the heading of ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION in this Annual Report, (page 41). Articles have been written and published in the "Newsletter", published monthly by the Council, but the main propaganda has been by direct verbal transmission in the kitchens of cafes and restaurants, factories and offices, and all types of premises, for it is firmly believed that this type of propaganda really carries a great deal of weight. 58 ANTI-FLY CAMPAIGN. The campaign to combat the fly nuisance was continued. By arrangement, and with the co-operation of the Cleansing and Transport Superintendent, all dustbins and dust chutes were dusted during the fly-breeding season with gammexane after the receptacles had been emptied by the Council's refuse collectors. During the year a full survey has been made of all refuse container compartments at the foot of the dust chutes in Local Authority flats and because of the rapidly changing nature of refuse, that is to say more bulk as the Smoke Control Area Programme continues, working' in close harmony with the Borough Engineer on this subject work is already planned to bring these refuse container compartments up to standard of the British Codes of Practice Number 306 (1960). FREE WASHING FACILITIES. Free washing facilities are installed in every public sanitary convenience in the Borough, but these are unfortunately not being used as much as we should like to see. PAID PUPILLAGE. Whilst it has been impossible to invoke a properly organised training scheme for students because of the complete absence of experienced District Inspectors and the depleted number of less experienced District Inspectors, the brighter prospects of a full complement of Public Health Inspectors in 1962 has enabled a proper scheme of training to be planned. There are at the moment two trainees in the Department and the establishment has been altered so that three trainees may be employed. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT 1960. The Noise Abatement Act, one year old on 27th November 1961, is now becoming well known. Local Authorities have dealt successfully with thousands of noise nuisance cases-most without going to Court, and the tremendous pressure by Public Health Inspectors and by other professional and voluntary bodies is bearing fruit. For the first time in history, a Minister of the Government has admitted that noise is harmful. The fact that his jurisdiction extends only to hospitals is lamentable; nevertheless, we salute the Right Honourable Enoch Powell for his courage in openly declaring that patients need quiet conditions for quick recovery. The instructions to hospital staff are already having a marked effect. The Government Committee on the problem of noise admit that their evidence tallies with the opinions of so many of us engaged in this important work, but some of their number hold the view that noise is part of the price we must pay for progress. Many organisations have been invited to submit suggested remedies to the Government Committee, and no doubt plenty of suggestions will be made which if implemented, will make the crime of noise nuisance most unprofitable. 59 NOISE ABATEMENT ACT 1960 (Contd.) It may even be that noisy road drills will soon be a relic of the barbaric past. Since the advent of the Noise Abatement Act an increasing number of people are beginning to realise that being forced to listen to unwanted sound is an invasion of their privacy and common law rights as a citizen, and from numerous cases of noise nuisance it has been learned of noise attacks on several main fronts, not the least of these by sapping energy so that the body and mind succumb to disease they could normally fight off. It is stated that a typist working in a noisy office uses up 20% of her available, energy simply fighting the noise, and in the case of an executive the figure rises to about 30%. If, therefore we take the national average to be but 10% and the average wage but £10, and the number of employed persons to be around 20 million, the cost to industry is around one thousand million pounds per annum. As already stated, a great deal of work has been done by local authorities without going into court, and Shoreditch is well to the fore in this respect, although several actions in the court have been heard. The range of noise nuisances dealt with by the Public Health Inspectors includes, noise from pile drivers, noise from garage, noise from juke boxes, noise from the loud speakers of ice cream vans. The only action in the Courts taken by the Shoreditch Borough Council, have been in respect of the latter. During the year 9 ice cream vendors were found to be offending the law sounding chimes during prohibited hours from ice cream vans. Four were taken to court and convictions recorded, and the remainder received warning letters. It is noticeable that the action in respect of ice cream vendors has certainly proved to be a deterrent. In every other instance of noise nuisance satisfactory results have been achieved by persuasion and being able to suggest practicable means of reducing noise. 60 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES (tables) The following tables summarize the visits of inspection and the work of the Public Health Inspectors during 1961.
