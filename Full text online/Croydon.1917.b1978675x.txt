November, 1918. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the County Borough of Croydon. Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report of the work carried out in the Public Health Department during the year 1918. There are many returns of interest which might profitably be analysed and commented upon, but the need of restricting the size of the report and also the great difficulty in getting time for quiet consideration of these matters has made it impossible to do so in the present circumstances. when more normal conditions return, with the return of the Public Health staff to civil occupations, I intend to review the work of the department during the war as a whole, and in that way give an indication of the maintenance of the public health services during what has been a difficult period. A very considerable difficulty has been experienced in adjusting the work of the staff to the constantly varying requirements of the town, but I have to acknowledge the very loyal co-operation of those who are serving the Corporation as temporary officers and employees. The results, in my opinion, indicate on the whole a well sustained public health control. In particular I would mention the remarkably light incidence of civil infections which has characterised the major part of the war period, with the exception of the first year and a half of the war. The Maternity and Infant work is growing continuously, and makes a very large demand upon the activities of the staff. The scheme for the treatment of Veneral Disease has completed its first year of active work, and a table is embodied in the report showing the returns of the various bodies which have taken part in the joint scheme for London and the surrounding Counties and County Boroughs. In the section of the department dealing directly with the treatmen of tuberculosis, a considerable addition to the work has arisen out of the examination of recruits for the Army and in connection with the treatment of soldiers and sailors discharged from the services suffering fro tuberculosis. 4 It is my pleasant duty to record the very willing and continuous help which I have received from all the temporary medical staff in their various spheres of work. I beg also to acknowledge the continued courtesy and help which has been extended to me and the whole department by all the members of the Council concerned in the different spheres of Public Health work of the Borough. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. VEITCH CLARK, Medical Officer of Health and School Medical Officer. 5 County Borough of Croydon. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1917. 6 VITAL STATISTICS. Population—Census of 1911 —169,551. Estimated Population, June 1917—186,917 (Registrar General's Estimate of Civilian Population). Birth Rate, per 1,000, 15.3. Death Rate, per 1,000 living, 11.09 Infantile Mortality, per 1,000 births, 87. 7 INFANT WORK. INFANTILE MORTALITY is measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to 1,000 births, and amounted to 87, as com pared with 77 in 1916, 83 in 1915, 79 in 1914, 94 in 1913. 77 in 1912, 105 in 1911, 87 in 1910, 79 in 1909, 99 in 1908, and 86 in 1907 During the year 1917, the rate for England and Wales was 97 while in the 96 large towns it was 104, and in the 148 smaller towns 93; in England and Wales, less the 244 towns, 88, and in London 103. The figures for the various Wards were:— Births, Deaths under 1 year Death-rate per 1000 Births (all causes) Death-rate per 1000 births from "diarrhœal" diseases. Upper Norwood Subdivision 81 4 76 0 North Ward 556 56 101 l6 Thornton Heath Subdivision 312 34 109 12 East Ward 357 22 61 9 BOROUGH 28???6 249 87 12 Central Ward 197 23 111 10 South Ward 248 23 92 12 West Ward 634 65 102 19 South Norwood Ward 451 22 48 5 The birth-rate 15.3 is exceedingly low, contrasting with the previous year's rate of 20.6. The infantile mortality rate is a little raised, but not at all markedly so. The deaths amongst infants show the regular heavy proportion of mortality amongst the illegitimate of the Borough, as will be seen from Table IV., 200 deaths occurring amongst 2,664 legitimate infants, as against 49 deaths in 182 illegitimate infants. The following table shows the fluctuations since 1892 in the infantile mortality from "all causes," from "diarrhœal diseases," and from "causes other than diarrhœal." Years. Total Infantile Mortality from all causes. Infantile Mortality from "diarrhœal" diseases. Infantile Mortality from other than "diarrhœal" disease 1893—1897 142 25 117 1898—1902 143 38 105 1903 104 9 95 1904 128 29 99 1905 96 14 82 1906 125 42 83 1907 86 10 85 1908 99 12 87 1909 79 7 72 1910 87 10 77 1911 105 33 72 1912 77 11 66 1913 94 16 78 1914 79 12 67 1915 83 8 75 1916 77 7 70 1917 87 12 75 8 DIARRHŒA AND EPIDEMIC ENTERITIS. Deaths classified in the tables supplied by the RegistrarGeneral as diarrhœa, epidemic enteritis, enteritis and gastro enteritis, have been included as "diarrhœal" deaths: as this classification corresponds with that adopted in former years, comparisons made on the resultant figures are valid. During 1917 diarrhœa and epidemic enteritis accounted for 7 deaths of infants under one year of age, 28 others being due to enteritis or gastro-enteritis, making a total of 35 deaths from "diarrhœal" diseases. A further 6 deaths at ages from one year or upwards were due to these diseases. INFANT CENTRES. The Borough Centre is held in the same place—228, London Road—as the School Treatment Centre and the Spinal Remedial Class. The Infant work consists of two medical consultations weekly on Tuesday and Friday afternoons. At the medical consultations there have been during the year 1917 approximately thirty-five children attending each afternoon. The progress made by the children is extremely gratifying in practically all instances. Acute illnesses are not dealt with, being referred to hospital or private medical men. Infant foods and, to a small extent, special foods for mothers are obtainable at the Centre. These are supplied free of cost only to the very poorest people. A charge is made to others, not exceeding the cost price of the article. Simple medicines are also prescribed and dispensed. The total number of infants seen at this Centre in the year 1917 has been:— New Cases 422 Total Attendances 3.466 The Centre was opened in the latter part of 1914. One of the Lady Health Visitors acts as the Nurse to the Centre. SICK NURSERY. At the Borough Centre is maintained a small Infant Sick Nursery. Six cots are provided, and the children admitted are practically entirely cases of ailing infants suffering from dietetic or marasmic conditions The cots have been kept well filled throughout the whole year, and the results practically regularly show beneficial changes in the welfare of the infants admitted. The Croydon Mothers and Infants Welfare Association provides nine other centres in the town. The town provides the nursing and medical staff for these centres. The work done by the association has grown greatly and has maintained a high level of efficiency. The co-operation between the Association and the Public Health Department is of the closest and pleasantest nature. 9 Maternity Hostel-—This Hostel has been run during the year by the Voluntary Association as previously. Great pressure of cases has been felt, and the urgent need of new and larger premises has been more and more realised as the year has passed. During the current year—1918—this need has been more largely met by the establishment of a new Hostel where 18 to 20 cases can be accommodated, in place of the titular accommodation for 8 cases in the previous Home. A lull account of the work of the new Hostel will be given in my report for 1918 The establishment and maintenance of a Maternity Home has been fully demonstrated by experience to meet a very greatly felt want in the Borough. METHOD OF FEEDING. The following are the particulars as to feeding of infants during the first six months of life of children who survived, and of children who died between one week and six months old Deaths of infants under one week have been excluded because it is unlikely that methods of feeding can have been responsible for a fatal issue in so short a time.

NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT (1907). This Act was adopted by the Council on January 13th, and came into force on February 19th, 1908, after confirmation by the Local Government Board. During the past year 2,015 notifications were received. These births were notified as follows:— Notified by medical men 603 Notified by parents 481 Notified by certified midwives 931 2,015 Stillborn births notified 51 Total 2,066 MIDWIVES' ACT, 1902. Nineteen midwives attended at the Infant and Children Centre, 228, London Road, for inspection, etc., during 1917. One hundred visits were paid by the Inspector of Midwives to the houses of 30 midwives. During the year 7 registered midwives withdrew from practice and left the district, and 5 new names were added, leaving 28 on the register on December 31st, 1917. 11 12 TABLE H. V.

GENERAL SANITARY WORK. The usual summary is given in Table VII., which gives a fair idea of the various matters engaging the attention of the Sanitary Inspectors. Inspections.—During the year 758 house to house inspections were made. Combined drainage.—The number of systems of combined drainage dealt with as single private drains during the year was 2. This work was carried out under the provisions of the Croydon Corporation Act, 1905. The cost of carrying out the necessary works amounted to £22 10s. 0d, and was borne by the owners instead of by the inhabitants at large. House drains relaid.—In 25 instances the whole of the house drains were relaid, and 96 house drains were repaired or partially relaid. Examination of drains.—73 written applications were received for the examination of the drains and sanitary condition of houses by occupiers or intending occupiers. In all cases special reports were made by the District Inspectors, copies of which were forwarded to the applicants; where defects were found, and in many cases where improvements were suggested, the work was carried out by the owners without the necessity of serving sanitary notices. Notices and Council Orders.—Most of the nuisances discovered were remedied on receipt of informal notices, but in 24 cases Council Orders had to be applied for. Eleven were complied with at the end of the year. MUNICIPAL COMMON LODGING HOUSE. This Lodging House affords accommodation for 17 women and 84 men. The number of nightly occupants during the year amounted to 26,522 men and 1,867 women, making a total of 28,389. The average number of lodgers amounted to 72 men and 5 women per night. The receipts and expenditure (exclusive of sinking fund and interest) for the past seven years were:— Receipts.

There are ten other houses on the register. The following Table gives the situation of the ten registered houses and the accommodation provided therein:— Premises. No. of Rooms. Accommodation. 11 & 12, Princess Road 12 54 men and 8 married couples. 9, Prosp of Place 7 18 men and 5 m married couples. 19. 20. 21, 22, 23 & 24, Lahore Road 30 50 men, 10 women, and 6 married couples. 52, Union Street 13 30 men. Nos. 19 to 24, Lahore Road—These houses are under one management and worked as one establishment, as also are Nos. 11 and 12, Princess Road. Practically, therefore, only four common lodging houses now remain in the Borough, with a total accommodation of 200 adults, or if we add the Municipal Common Lodging House, a total of five houses with 263 single beds and 19 double beds. During the year common lodging houses received 575 visits, while 10 houses received night visits. Minor infringements of bye-laws were detected on 30 occasions, but in no case were they sufficiently serious for legal proceedings to be taken. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. There are 52 houses registered under the bye-laws. During the year these houses received 976 visits. On no occasion were offences discovered for which prosecutions were necessary. At the present moment the following houses are registered as houses let in lodgings:— Wilford Road 29 Forster Road 9 Holmesdale Road 4 Beulah Grove 1 Ely Road 8 Princess Road 1 52 44 HOUSE INSPECTIONS made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year ended 31st December, 1917.

The main attention of the inspectorate has been directed towards the detection and abatement of actual existing nuisances, the routine work unavoidably having been left alone to a considerable extent. As a result of these inspections, 978 preliminary notices were served during the year. The numbers in this table are in addition to 589 inspections of houses where infectious diseases have been notified, and 73 inspections on request of larger houses where the drains were tested and special reports sent to occupiers, prospective occupiers, or owners. Full details of general sanitary work are given in the Summary in Table VIII. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT.

Twenty-four communications were sent to H.M. Inspector of Factories in accordance with the various requirements of the Act. HOMEWORK. 133 lists were received from employers, containing the names of 326 outworkers residing in the Borough. 155 further names were received from the Medical Officers of Health of various neighbouring districts, and the names of 42 outworkers residing outside the Borough were similarly despatched to the Medical Officer of Health for the district concerned. 304 visits were paid to outworkers. 45 visits were made to premises of employers of outworkers for the purpose of examining lists and other particulars. BAKEHOUSES. At the end of the year there were 78 Bakehouses in occupation, of which 7 were underground. 593 visits were made by the Inspector during the year, and 39 nuisances discovered and abated. WORKPLACES. At the end of the year there were 82 workplaces on the register. 71 visits to eating-house kitchens have been made, and 16 nuisances discovered and abated. SMOKE NUISANCES. 13 complaints of smoke nuisances were attended to. RAG FLOCK ACT, 1912. Five inspections were made of premises occupied by upholsterers and bedding manufacturers. Very little work was done in the workshops in consequence of the war. No samples were taken. 47 TABLE VII. Work done by the Sanitary Inspectors during the Year ending 31st December, 1917.

In 45 cases the samples were below the standard suggested by the Board of Agriculture. Proceedings were instituted in respect of 17 of these samples, and fines and costs were imposed on the vendors to the extent of £227 11s. The other 28 samples were only slightly below the standard suggested by the Board of Agriculture. In 9 cases the vendors were written to asking for an explanation, and in all cases subsequent samples were taken No samples of cream were submitted for analysis during the year. Sixty two samples of butter were taken during the year. Four only proved to be not genuine. These were test samples, and subsequent samples proved genuine. Thirty-three other samples were taken, and, with the exception of one sample of lard and one sample of egg powder they all proved genuine. The lard was a test sample and was reported to have had water possibly in the form of milk. Subsequent sample proved genuine. MILK AND CREAM REGULATIONS, 1912.

During this year there has come into active being a scheme for the treatment of Venereal Diseases, a co-ordinated effort of the London County Council, the Counties of Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, Kent, Herts and Bucks, and the County Boroughs of Croydon, West Ham and East Ham. These took the form of an agreement with 22 different London hospitals for the establishment of clinics for the treatment of these diseases. The estimates made were approved by all the Councils concerned, and the monies were pooled and taken charge of by the Local Government Board, which has been the authority assigning on the reports from the various hospitals the final contributions to be made by the different Councils concerned, and in turn handing over the proportion of the amounts in such sums to the individual hospitals in respect of work carried out by them. Throughout the year numerous conferences of the Medical Officers of the Counties and County Boroughs concerned have been told to discuss and arrange the many complicated details of the working of the scheme. A very considerable degree of success has attended these efforts, and the sub-joined table shows a summary of the patients dealt with at the different clinics, giving the number of such people coming from the individual contributory areas. A local treatment centre has also been established during the year at the Croydon General Hospital, at which women and children of both sexes up to the age of 18 years are eligible for treatment. This centre, however, could not be got into working order until the last quarter of the year. No figures are, therefore, given in this report with reference to the work done at this centre, as the period has been too short to make them of value. 73 VENEREAL DISESES Annual Summary Year 1917.

Nineteen young persons who desired to become Bursars and Student-Teachers and one desiring to become a Pupil Teacher were medically examined during the year. TEACHING OF INFANT CARE. The Infant Care Class has been continued at the Tavistock Grove School. It has not been possible to maintain such a regular attendance of one of the medical officers owing to staffing difficulties, but this has been maintained very fully on the whole. One of the health visitors attends regularly. Short talks have been given at each meeting by one or other of these officers on matters relating to infant welfare. 97 98
