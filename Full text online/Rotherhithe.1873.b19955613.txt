Commercial Street, to be " Osprey Street" Wellington Street, Deptford Koad, to be "Trident Street." The Vestry, with the consent of the Trustees of the Burial Grounds have erected a Mortuary in the Burial Ground, Church Street, and converted the old dead house there into a Dissecting Room. The attention of the Vestry having been called to a proposal of the School Board for London to erect schools at the east end of the Parish, in the neighbourhood of Silver Street, also that a Memorial numerously signed by influential residents, ratepayers in that locality, had been presented to the said Board against such proceedings, inasmuch as there were several schools iu the immediate vicinity, which were capable of accommodating a much larger number of children than were then attending the same; it was resolved to support such Memorial, and to communicate with the School Board for Loudon, aud more especially the Members of the Board representing this di.strict to that effect, subsequently a reply was received from the Board stating that as they had received assurances from the Managers of the neighbouring voluntary schools to make suitable provision iu their schools for the class of children for whom the intended accommodation was to provided, the Board had. under the circumstances, determined not to hire the Silver Street School Kooin.

From the 1st April, 1873, to March 31st, 1874. The Vestry of the Parish of Botlierhithe, Surrey. Gentlemen, Since the introduction of more comprehensive sanitary laws, than those which existed before the the establishment of a local nuisance authority, under the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855, there has been a desire evinced to improve from time to time our sanitary legislation, and year after year expectations have been entertained that amendments would be made, and the sanitarv laws consolidated, so as to remove some of the difficulties which beset the efficient working of the various Acts of Parliament which relate to sanitary matters. This work has only been partially achieved at present, and the only step of importance in this direction, 1 have to communicate is contained in the enactments of the Public Health Bill of 1872, this Act of Parliament gave power to form sanitary country districts, and appoint medical officers of health, and gave to London its port sanitary medical officer, it is impossible to overrate the importance of both these additions to our sanitary code, but we are more particularly concerned with that which relates to the Port of London. Before the appointment of Dr. Harry Leach as the medical officer of health for the Port of London, our security from the introduction of epidemic diseases into this country, by the crews of foreign vessels entering the River Thames, was confided to the Officers ot Her Majesty's Customs, who doubtless used the most praiseworthy efforts to accomplish the duties assigned to them, but the means at their command were insufficient. we have therefore to congratulate ourselves on now being provided with a staff of officers, who will give us every possible security from the importation of epidemic diseases from abroad, by the source of the Thames. No district in London is ever free from the presence of epidemic disease of some kind, and with the exception of lever of the continued type, and Asiatic cholera, the fatal effects of these diseases are chiefly observed among the young; the susceptibility ranges from one ten yean of age, and alter that period of life it almost ceases, the late oi mortality is so much influenced by the extent to which epidemic diseases prevail, and the character lor mildness or severity, oi the particular epidemic, that it 21 is always a source of satisfaction to find the loss of life diminishing in this class of diseases, moreover it imports hope to the sanitary labourer, that in this field of work. he is not using his efforts in Tain, and that by causing the removal ot nuisances, improving the dwellings of the people, using disinfection judiciously and as effectively as far as he has means at command, something has been done perhaps as much as is practiccablc, to lessen this form of disease and preserve human lite. The table be1ow will represent the number of deaths which have been produced by some of the most destructive of epidemic diseases, during the last seven years, the total number is seven hundred and twenty-eight, and eighty only have occurred this year, viz :— Fever. Seven cases of typhoid, one of typhus, and one of continued fever were registered. Small-Pox. Not a single death from this cause has been registered. I believe this circumstance to he unparallelled. and strikingly illustrates how much may be done in preventing this disease by a vigilant attention to vaccination. Scarlatina. Another unusual circumstance is the fact that only two fatal cases of Scarlatina have occurred. Measles. This disease has been more fatal than usual, twenty-two cases having been registered. Whooping Ceugh. Twenty fatal eases occurred which are about the average number. Diarrhoea was rather more fatal than usual, twenty-seven deaths having been registered. Dipthcria. Not a fatal case occurred. TABLE OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES. Disease. 1868 1869 1870 1871 1872 1873 1874 Total.

There arc indications that the population of this Parish will increase at a more rapid rate than hitherto, the registration of births during the last three 22 years shown an unusual augmentation, and we see around us great activity displayed in building houses, adapted to the wants of all classes, but more especially the artizans, and as these houses are tenanted as ioon as they are fit for occupation, there is evidently a tide of migration going on towards this Parish which must increase the adult population very considerably. One thousand and sixty-nine births were registered, five hundred and seventeen males, and five hundred and filty-two females, in the former year one thousand and six births were registered, the increase will consequently be sixty-three. An arrangement of the births into quarterly divisions will be as follows:— Births. From April 1, 1873, to June 30, 1873 217 „ July 1, 1873, to September 30, 1873 285 „ October 1, 1873, to December 31, 1873 272 „ January 1, 1874, to March 31,1874 295 1069 Deaths. Five hundred and eighty deaths were registered, two hundred and eighty-six males, and two hundred and ninety-four females, including that of a female aged 101, the births have therefore exceeded the deaths by four hundred and eighty-nine. The number of deaths which occurred in each quarterly division of the year will be represented by the following table, viz :— Deaths. From April 1, 1873, to June 30, 1873 149 „ .Inly 1, 1873, to September 30, 1873 137 „ October 1, 1873, to December 31, 1873 148 „ January 1, 18V4, to March 31, 1874 146 580 The number of deaths in the Infirmary of the St, Olave's Union wag twentyeight, compared with thirty-seven in the previous year; seventeen of these patients had been tent from Rotherhithc, eight from Berinondsey, one from St. Olave's, two from St. John's parishes: Forty-five Inquests were held, and nineteen of these deaths occurred to persons who had not resided in this parish, a deduction in these two classes must therefore be made, amounting to thirty, and the actual number of deaths due to this parish will be live hundred and fifty. The rate of mortality compared with the two previous years, making an allowance for increase of population will be ascertained by referring to the accompanying table. No. of Correoted Per Deaths.

Various forms of nuisances have engaged the attention of the Sanitary Inspector and myself, and it was necessary to serve one hundred and twenty-six notices, for the abatement of them. An addition to our sanitary efficiency is to be attributed to the erection of a new mortuary in the burial ground of the parish, and in an adjoining brick built room arrangements have been made for conducting post-mortem inspections. From the district of the parish suppliec with water by the Kent water company, no complaints have been made, but from that supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company, the chronic complaint of scarcity has again been expressed during the summer months. Periodical examinations of the Slaughter-houses and Cow-houses have been made during the year and as the premises of the various occupiers wore found in fair condition at the time of inspection, no objection was raised by the Vestry to the renewal of the respective licenses. The inspection of Hake-houses is never an agreeable duty, owing to the reluctance which a few of the owners manifest to cleanse their premises within the prescribed time, alter more trouble than usual. the object of our various visits was accomplished.
