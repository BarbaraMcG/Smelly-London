In June, another nursery of similar type was opened at Westway with accommodation for 50 children, and in August yet another nursery was opened in Uxbridge Boad with accommodation for 60 children. The latter is accommodated in two large houses, which have been adapted for the purpose. All the nurseries have been well attended by children whose mothers are for the most part engaged on war work, and at each of the nurseries there is a waiting list of mothers seeking accommodation for their children. To meet this demand the Brook Green Nursery has been extended by the addition of a wing, and it now has accommodation for 83 children. Two other nurseries of the " pre-fabricated hut " type are now in course of erection at Bailing Boad and on the White City Estate. Residential Nursery.—To meet the needs of mothers requiring accommodation for their children in a residential nursery the Council, with the co-operation of the Ministry of Health, requisitioned a large house at Iver Heath, Bucks, and converted it for the purpose. The nursery which was opened in February, 1941. has accommodation for 8 babies and 30 children from one to five years. It has been practically full ever since it was opened, and there has always been a list of children awaiting admission. 13 CHILD LIFE PROTECTION. Public Health (London) Act, 1936.

In April, 1942, the Council's Tuberculosis Officer was called for service with H.M. Forces, and arrangements were made with the British Post-Graduate Medical School (which is also housed in the Hammersmith Hospital) for a member of the School's staff to act as clinician at the Dispensary. An agreement has since been entered into between the Council and the School by which the School will provide the services of a doctor who will act as Tuberculosis Officer, and they will also supply any necessary clinical assistance. The Council will as before provide nursing and clerical staff. Five sessions are held each week at the clinic at which patients are seen by appointment. New Patients.—During the year 518 persons attended for examination for the first time, 241 males and 277 females. Of these 113 were under the age of fifteen and 405 were adults. Of the total 245 were referred to the clinic by local practitioners for the purpose of consultation and 93 by the National Service Medical Boards. One hundred and eighty were "contacts" of persons suffering from tuberculosis. Of the "contacts" examined 22 were definitely cases of tuberculosis, whilst 158 were nontuberculous. Total Attendances and Examinations.—The total attendances of persons for the purpose of examination, observation or treatment, numbered 3,394, and physical examinations were carried out in 3,265 instances, i.e., in 96 per cent. of the total attendances. 35 Home Visitation.—The Tuberculosis Officer made 17 visits to homes of patients for the purpose of examination and investigation of the home conditions. The Health Visitors visit cases of tuberculosis on notification, and thereafter as far as possible at intervals of six months or less, as may appear advisable. During the year 2,209 such visits were made. During the year 61 definite cases were transferred from other areas into the Borough and 66 moved out or were lost sight of. Five were written off the register as being cured. 36 FOOD SUPPLIES. Unsound Food. One seizure of unsound food was made during the year. A quantity of unsound food was voluntarily surrendered during the year of which a large proportion was salvaged for use as animal and chicken food or recovery of fats for trade purposes other than for human consumption. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1928. 800 samples of various foods and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst during the year by the Council's Sampling Officer for analysis; 9 were found to be inferior and 44 were adulterated. Legal proceedings were taken in respect of 13 of the adulterated samples, and penalties and costs amounting to £86 16s. 6d. were imposed. PHOSPHATASE TEST. 28 samples of milk sold under the special designation "Pasteurised" were submitted to the phosphatase test during the year. The results of these examinations showed that the pasteurising process had been properly carried out in each case.
