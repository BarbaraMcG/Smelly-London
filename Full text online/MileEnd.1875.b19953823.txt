The Vestry have much pleasure in submitting a report of their proceedings for the year ending 25th March, 1876. The Vestry have, during the year, lost by death the services of their esteemed colleague, Mr. W. Newton. For many years Mr. Newton had devoted his great energies and talents for the benefit of this Hamlet, and had been for a number of years the representative of the Vestry at the Metropolitan Board of Works. In the consideration of all the stupendous works for the improvement of London which came before him at that Board Mr. Newton had exercised a most important influence, and had acquired a reputation for ability throughout the whole Metropolis, and the Vestry feel that not only have they lost an esteemed colleague, but that the Metropolis generally, and this Hamlet in particular, have lost a representative whose place it will be nearly impossible to fill. The details of the various works carried out by the Vestry during the year will be found set out in the separate reports of heads of the departments to which such works belong. There have not been works of any great magnitude executed during the year, but the existing ones have been kept in a state of efficiency. In consequence of the works of the East London Railway Company it became necessary to divert the sewer in Bedford Street, and, under an arrangement with the Company, the work has been done by the Vestry's Contractor, but the Company are to pay the cost. 8 That part of the Mile End Road used by the Tramways Company still continues to be a source of endless trouble. As intimated in the last Report legal proceedings have had to be taken against the Guardians of the Whitechapel Union with a view of enforcing payment of the proportion of the cost of paving the East side of South Grove. The Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice have decided that the manner of apportionment is incorrect, and that the Guardians are not liable for the amount claimed. Acting upon Counsel's advice the decision was appealed against to the High Court of Appeal, but that Court has upheld the decision of the Court below. A fresh apportionment will therefore have to be made. The contracts for horses, carts and drivers, and for the removal of dust, are at considerably increased prices. A list of all contracts entered into will be found at the end of the Abstract of Accounts. The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works has not been received but will be rather less than that of last year. The precept of the School Board for London, however, exhibits the enormous increase of £1839 16s. 9d. over that of last year, and for the general information the Vestry beg to give the amounts of the various precepts received from that Board since its institution. Year £ S. d. 1871 536 17 3 1872 1001 8 10 1873 827 17 2 1874 1989 3 10 1875 3496 6 11 1870 5335 17 3 9 Under the Act of Parliament the amount to be paid to the School Board has to be collected in the General Rate. In the £ The General Rate for the year has amounted to Is. 6d. The Lighting Rate Os. 3d. The Sewer (excluding Consolidated Rate) Os. 2d. Making a total of 1s. l1d. But if from this be taken 3d. in the £ for the School Board, it will give the amount required for Vestry purposes proper 1s. 8d in the £, which is identical with that of last year. This enables the Vestry to do all its works and keep down the interest and instalments of the various loans. The amount of the loans will be seen on reference to the Abstract of Accounts. The Poor Rate has amounted to 2s. 1d. in the £. In the present Session of Parliament the Great Eastern Railway Company have had a bill for the widening of their line, and the Vestry determined, if possible, to obtain an improvement of the Bridges over the principal thoroughfares in the Hamlet. The matter was hardly fought before the Committee of the House of Commons, and ultimately a provision was inserted that upon this Vestry and the Vestry of Bethnal Green each contributing £500 towards the expenses the Company are, when executing the work, to pull down the old bridge over Grove Road, and construct the whole of a width of 40 feet with a 15 feet headway, Various other provisions, such as lighting, &c., have been obtained, which will vastly improve the thoroughfare under various bridges. The road called Medway Road being situate partly in this Hamlet and partly in Bethnal Green with the boundary running through it longitudinally, the Metropolitan Board of Works made an order under the Act 10 dividing it transversely and placing one port ion under the jurisdiction of this Vestry and the other under that of Bethnal Green. Orders of the same Hoard have also been received for renumbering and abolishing subsidiary names in Bow Common Lane || Grove Road, &c. Names of Streets or Roads to be abolished. 1 Grove Street (Clinton Road.) 2 Norfolk Street 3 Now St., Fieldgate St. 4 York St., Commrl.

Varden Street Yalford Street Myrdle Street Wall wood Street Walden Street Charles Street The Vestry have resolved that the following new Streets shall be made up and paved at the expence of the owners of property in such streets, viz., 1.

Proceedings under the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, have had to be taken in respect of properties in Upper York Place and Cottage Court, Hayfield Passage, but in each case the works ordered are being proceeded with. There have been 21 Meetings of the Vestry. The average attendance of the members of the Vestry has has boon over 50. There have been beside 81 meetings of the Standing and Special Committees. 11 The Accounts for the year ending 25th March last were submitted to the Auditors and duly audited, vouched, and allowed, except as to a sum of £125, part of the moneys paid to the Clerk of the Assessment Committee for the expenses of that Committee. A ratepayer having objected to the amount, vouchers for the total amount could not at the moment be produced, and the account therefore was not passed in toto, but the matter will, without doubt, be satisfactorily cleared up at the next audit. The Abstract of the Accounts, as certified by the Auditors pursuant to the Statute, is printed with this Report. Vestry Hall, Bancroft Road, Mile End. June, 1876.

Gentlemen, I have again the pleasure of laying before you a few statistics appertaining to the ordinary work of my department, for the year ending March 25th, 1876. From the tables at the end of this Report of the cost of road materials, labour, and horse hire, it will be found that the year just completed compares favourably with the two preceding, but I regret to say that the Vestry have just entered a season during which their cartage will cost them considerably more than it has for any like period during the past ten years. This arises from two causes, first, the large increase in the contract price of horse hire; and second, the increased distance the road sweepings have to be carted. The Vestry have, for many years, had a great advantage over most East End Parishes, in the facility afforded to them for the removal of street refuse by the Great Eastern Railway Company. This Company entered into a contract with me on your behalf to carry 34 to such parts of the Eastern Counties, as experience told them were good markets for the description of manure, about 7000 tons of street refuse every year. Any portion which was sold for manure was removed by the Company free of cost to the Vestry, and upon the portion not saleable the Vestry paid an uniform rate of 1s. 6d.per ton, that being the minimum rate of the Company. In January last I received notice, under the agreement, that the Company would close their gates against the Vestry's carts within forty-eight hours, and this they did. For a week in January you were entirely without a place of deposit, during this time the slop had to be shot into barges, which were ultimately unloaded on the banks of the river Lee. At the time of the notice there were about 5000 tons of material at the depot, which had been deposited by the Vestry in a state of slop, and which was not only unsaleable, but much of it, owing to the water it contained, could not be removed in railway trucks. A small portion has been taken away but a very large quantity still remains. For the current year I was enabled to enter into an agreement with the lessee of a piece of land at Hackney Wick, to receive all the Vestry's refuse for the sum of £60, which, under the circumstances, was a good arrangement for the Vestry, but this will not last beyond Christmas next. The ultimate disposal of the refuse of London is a subject which is becoming a greater difficulty to the various Parishes every year. The Vestry may probably except from me some suggestion as to what is to bo done in the future, and although the question is one of universal 35 difficulty, I venture to say that, so far as the Eastern part of London is concerned, the Hackney Marshes will (owing to their level) provide a site which requires to be raised in order to fit the land for building purposes, and that the acquisition of such land will be found to be a profitable speculation. An acre of low lying marsh unfit for building purposes, is worth as much rent per year for a shoot as it would be were it a level twelve feet above its present surface, and when raised to the proper level it is of the value of other building land in the neighbourhood. It has been suggested that the gases produced in the decomposition of animal and vegetable matter would be likely to escape into the houses erected upon street refuse, but any one who has to remove the material which has laid for a year will know how exceedingly hard it is. and that all gases of decomposition are absorbed by the earth which form part of the material. Foundations such as these I am now speaking of are sure to be well drained, and three inches of good concrete will make an impermeable slab between the earth and the interior of a dwelling, which, in the case of six-roomed houses, would only cost £2 per house. So long as this field is open the annual cost of removing street refuse will steadily increase, but when this fails the cost will be more than doubled. The reed beds on the Essex shores will be the next place available for East London, if the North, South, or West do not take possession of them first. In this case a fleet of barges specially constructed, and towed by steam-tugs, will have to be used; but again, in this case, the conversion of comparatively valueless land into useful wharves is the advantage gained. 36 Unpaved Carriageways.

During the year the water-carts and wagons were employed 106 days, at a cost of £887 7s. 6d. for horses and drivers, and of £363 15s. 9d. for 8,861,000 gallons of water, supplied by the East London Water Company. Footpaths. No important paving works have been executed during the year, but 5080 feet of 2½-inch and 5175 feet of 2-inch, have been used, the cost of which was £281 8s. 4d. Experience has now shewn the value of asphalte footpaths for the main thoroughfares of this Hamlet; that laid three years ago in the Mile End Road, has shewn the concrete through in places, and the Company who laid it have made it good, but I am satisfied that half an inch of asphalte is useless as a permanent footpath in the main thoroughfares of this Hamlet. The piece of footway laid with powdered rock asphalte appears to stand better than that laid in a mastic state. Tramways. The condition of the Mile End Road, which was the first tramway laid in London, still continues in a bad state of repair, It is made with flat rails laid on sleepers, fastened only by spikes driven through holes in the grooves, the heads of which rapidly cut off with the traffic. Lighting. The lighting of this Hamlet is done by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 824 lamps. The cost for the year has been £3,559 18s. 8d. Sewers. During the year 560 run of 12-inch pipe sewer have been laid by you and 113 house drains have been connected with the sewers under your control. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. M.

London: Painted by T. PENNY & Co., 121, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1876. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Twentieth Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of the Hamlet for the year ending March, 1876. I have estimated the population of the Hamlet during the year 1875-6, at 100,000, although it is now about 5,000 above that number, and during the current year I shall adopt this increase for statistical purposes. Births. The number of births registered in the Hamlet during the year was 4005, compared with 4010 the previous year; the birth-rate was thus 40 per 1000 of the population, that for the whole of the Metropolis being 35.5, and for the whole country 35.39. I am, on the other hand, able to congratulate you upon a low death-rate. With many authorities upon vital statistics, it is an accepted theory that a high birth and low death-rate are incompatible. For many years this Metropolitan Hamlet has disproved this theory. Marriages. The marriage-rate in the Hamlet was a fraction over 19 per 1000, being about two per 1000 over the rate for the whole county. The previous year the rate was rather under 19. 44 Deaths. The total number of deaths for the year endin March, 1876, was 2077, compared with 21G5 the pre vious year, showing a decrease of 88. The average number for three previous years was 2077, or the same as for the past year. The death-rate was 20.77 per 1000 population living in the Hamlet. The rate for the whole Metropolis was 23.10. Owing to the continued absence of the District Registrar's Returns, I cannot give a complete statistical and tabular return of the mortality from diseases of all kinds, nor a comparison of the number of deaths in the different Wards of the Hamlet. There is much other information of interest to you as the sanitary authority which I could supply from these returns. I therefore feel much satisfaction that you have agreed with the Districts Registrars to supply mo with such Returns in future. Zymotic Diseases. The death-rate per 1000 population from the seven principal diseases in the preventable class, including small pox, scarlet fever, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, fever, and diarrhoea, was 4½ in Mile End, the same in the Metropolis generally, and 4¼ in 18 of the largest English towns. Although the general death-rate of the Hamlet was low, it will be seen, upon reference to the Table, that the deaths from this class of diseases amounted to nearly one-fifth the total, and if to those be added the deaths from suppressed infectious diseases, in which the external symptoms arc not developed, I have no doubt the number would be equal to more than one-fourth the total mortality. It certainly appears a serious indictment against sanitary science and its administrative authorities that about one-fourth the total 45 mortality is causedby diseases acknowledged to be amenable to the measures which the law empowers us to employ. But this is not all, for all diseases non-infectious as well as infectious, are caused or influenced in their course for good or evil by the condition of the atmosphere, the water supply, the general sanitary condition of sick rooms, and the surroundings of dwellings, &c., so that much of the health and many of the lives of considerably over 100,000 persons in this Hamlet depend upon your care and vigilence as the health authority, and nearly all your duties have a more or less direct tendency towards promoting these desirable results, I am not able to make a comparison of the number of deaths in the different Wards of the Hamlet, owing to absence of the Registrar's Returns, but I can give the numbers for each of the two registration divisions into which the Hamlet is divided. The number of persons living to each acre is 211.6 in the Western, and 122.4 in the Eastern Division, yet, and as I showed also in my last Annual Report, the death-rate in the more crowded division is considerably less than that of the less crowded. The respective death-rates per 1000 population being 18.1 and 22.5. The density of the population in the former being nearly double that of the latter division. Again, in the class of infectious diseases, there is a considerable excess of deaths in the Eastern compared with the Western Division. The only disease showing a higher deathrate in the Western Division being diarrhoea. Almost everything is in excess in the Eastern Division, except the density of population, which is only half that of the Western. The birth-rate is higher. The general deathrate is higher, as are also the rates from infectious diseases collectively, and with the exception of diarrhœa, all are individually higher, in some cases as measles and scarlet fever, nearly double. This appears a some 46 what anomalous condition and scarcely reconcilable with the usually accepted hygienic views and practical experience of such circumstances. Were the disproportion between the death-rates in the two districts distributed equally through all classes of disease, the cause would be discovered in the fact that the deaths in old persons above 60 years of age in the Eastern, were nearly double those in the Western District, owing to the Workhouses being situated in the Eastern. But when we find the mortality from the principal infectious diseases so largely in excess in one defined district over that of an adjoining district, we must look for other reasons. The death-rate for infants is about equal. Much of the causes for producing the disproportion may be attributable to the existence of a large poor population in the Centre Ward, and in a large portion of the East Ward. There were no deaths from small pox in the Hamlet during the whole year. I have again been unable, in reply to my application, to obtain for the information of the Vestry the vaccination statistics of the Hamlet. Before quitting the subject of infectious diseases. I have to acknowledge much valuable information voluntarily given to me by the Medical Officers of the Board of Guardians, Drs. Cæsar, this has frequently enabled me to take prompt measures, when most urgently required, in cases which could not otherwise have come under my notice. I am also indebted, for similar prompt assistance, to the Vicar of St. Philip's and the other clergy of the West Ward of the Hamlet. Subjoined is the Sanitary Inspector's Report, which will bo the best evidence of the assiduity and zeal with which he has performed his duties:— 47 Sanitary Inspector's Report of Works Executed during the Years 1875—1876. Houses and premises connected with sewers 95 Old drains abolished 80 Houses cleansed and purified 136 Houses disinfected 40 Houses visited where contagious diseases had occurred, and Notices served re contagious diseases 95 Traps provided to drains and closets 86 Drains cleansed and repaired 175 Cesspools abolished 10 Water supply provided to houses 15 Accumulations of dung and offensive matter removed 37 Houses from which pigs were removed 12 Many inspections have been made during the year of premises where offensive works are carried on, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge, I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. In addition to the above, all bakehouses have been visited twice during the year, and where necessary, Notices were served, requiring the respective owners to limewhite and otherwise cleanse the same. The slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have likewise been frequently visited, and many improvements effected. HENRY LESHAW, Sanitary Inspector. 48 It will be observed that a large number of old drains still continue to bo discovered and abolished, as also old cesspools. They are both great sources of atmospheric pollution and danger to health; they are the factors whence specific infection may actually originate, or if not they have often palpably retained it locked up for years, and until discovered, causing mysterious visitations of typhoid or scarlet fever. The modern main drainage system in the Metropolis has proved that it is comparatively easy to get rid of the solid and liquid sewage from our houses and doors, but that it is not so controlable when it assumes a gaseous form in the great sewers, where it will not, of course, circulate with the liquid and suspended sewage and escape with it from the mouths of the sewers, but rises or is forced just sufficiently high both in houses and out of doors to become unavoidably respirable. Viewed in this light, the great modern sewerage system of the Metropolis is a greater source of atmospheric pollution than was the old cesspool system with all its local objections and abominations, and to which of course wo could not return. The vexed questions to bo solved arc effective sewer ventilation and prevention of sower deposits, whence the most noxious and offensive effluvia arise, and efficient and general smoke consumption, both domestic and manufacting. Hence the chief sources of general atmospheric pollution in the Metropolis, are smoke, sewer gases, and suspended matter arising from all kinds of sources, organic and inorganic, from the products of respiration of living beings, and from the comminuted filth of the streets. This condition of the London air is often palpable enough, especially when its pressure is great and movement slow, so that those impurities cannot escape producing effects, of which general lassitude and mental depression are often the least injurious. We should be at least as 49 solicitous to breathe clear and pure air as to eat clean and pure food and drink, whether water or other fluids. We hear of constant care and anxiety, with regard to these and special Acts of Parliament, to secure them, but that perpetual necessary of life without which we cannot exist even for a few moments, may be polluted with filth and poison from all kinds of sources, without much regard being given to the immediate or ultimate consequences. We have only to look at the good effect upon health of temporary change into a clear phere to realize the urgent necessity for preventing, as far as possible, the pollution of the air supply of the enormous population of this Metropolis, and especially of its central parts. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Acts. I have not hitherto deemed it necessary to report to the local authority, under the Act of 1874, which, as you are aware, gives such comprehensive powers, in the case of large areas proved to be unhealthy or where the houses are unfit for habitation. Having upon several occasions reported to the Vestry under the Act of 1868 (Torrens'), with fairly successful results, I have thought it better, up to the present time, to continue to proceed under this Act, where circumstances rendered such a course necessary. During the past year I recommended proceedings under the Act, in the case of eight houses in Cottage Court, Stepney Green, and the necessary works are now being carried out, including extensive structural alterations. Water Supply. The water supplied by the East London Company has been almost invariably of good quality, and compared most favourably with the other Metropolitan 50 waters. This good result is mainly due to the measures adopted by the Company for its reserve storage and efficient filtration, the domestic supply has been at the rate of about 25 or 26 gallons daily per head for the population of the Hamlet. This quantity is unfortunately, of course, not used, firstly, because the majority of houses have not the provision for storing a fourth of the supply, and secondly, if they had such, they would not use it, at least not until taught the great benefit derivable therefrom; this they have not been able to learn because they have not the means provided to keep the quantity supplied; neither can they, nor would if they could, preserve it in the all but pure condition in which it reaches them from the Company, a qualitative condition which many country towns and villages would be glad to obtain. Landlords of the small class of house property usually pay water rates direct to the Company; they pay for that which is not used or not received. Owners of this kind of property have much to contend with, and are frequently visited with unmerited obloquy and penalties owing to the dirty and dilapidated condition which these houses rapidly fall into from carelessness, neglect, or wilful damage, on the part of the occupants; at the same time, I am sure if these tenants had better and larger means for storing water they would use it, keep their houses in a more creditable condition, and do less injustice to the landlord. I am glad to find that which I have always advocated, viz., an entirely separate and disconnected closet and domestic supply, are found more frequent than formerly. Either sufficient water storage must be provided for every dwelling, or a sufficient number of public baths and wash-houses must be established in every district. Water, air, and light, are nature's disinfectants and preventives of disease; they are abundantly provided, but most meagrely and inef- 51 fectively used, indeed practically ignored, by architects, builders, owners, and occupiers. New Houses and other Buildings. The following return, for which I am indebted to Mr. Legg, the District Surveyor, shows the number of dwellings and other buildings erected in the Hamlet during the past year:— New houses 210 Church 1 Iron ditto 1 Synagogue 1 Theatre 1 School Board School 1 Although I much regret to see the open spaces disappearing rapidly, one after another, still, if the population of the Hamlet persist in increasing in the way it has done of late years, provision must be made for its shelter. But last year this increase in the number of new houses was neutralized, temporarily at least, by about an equal number having been demolished for railway purposes, so that there was no absolute addition to the house accommodation for the increased population. I am satisfied there is very great overcrowding in some parts of the Hamlet, than which nothing is more injurious to the general health, and more likely to produce fever and other diseases. Healthy dwellings, if attainable, would be the greatest desiderata to health and comfort, but from foundation to roof the construction of an ordinary human habitation is a series of blunders in respect to both these desirable conditions, unless, indeed, they are designedly contrived to cause illness and misery and all that is inimical to health and convenience in a domestic interior. 52 These defects need not be detailed; they are sufficiently impressed upon most occupiers of such houses by the agency of rheumatism, bronchitis, influenza, and other ailments, more often contracted within than without the shelter of our abodes. The universal smoky chimney and defective drain, play a not inconsiderable part in the general rôle of domestic dangers to health. The question of foundations for new houses has recently attracted some attention, and has been brought under the notice of the Government. Houses have been and are built upon ground made up of decomposing refuse and without the foundations being prepared with any regard to sanitary conditions. I brought this question before you some years since, and at that time corresponded with the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject, who promised to keep the matter in view and to provide a remedy for the evil. There are now six Board Schools in the Hamlet. In reply to letters of enquiry as to the health of the pupils, I have been favored with replies from three of the School Principals, viz.:— Essex Street School, with 1045 children, has an average of twelve only absent through sickness, and Mr. Gilbert states, very few have suffered from infectious diseases during the year. Baker Street School, with 390 children, Mr. Usherwood states, the absent from sickness to be, boys four per cent., girls 5, infants 9. Infectious diseases has been very rare. St. Paul's Road School, with 1075 children, Mr. E. Johnson reports twenty-four absent through sickness, and four sent away on account of infectious disease being reported in their homes. These appear to be exceedingly favourable returns, showing an average sickness of less than 2.5 per cent. among over 2,500 children and infants, at ages most 53 susceptible to illness. Much of this is no doubt due to the care of the school officials, to the superior sanitary condition of the school buildings, compared with the unhealthy homes of the children, together with greater regard to cleanliness and proper clothing, rendered necessary by school attendance. By degrees the direct effect of education itself will prove the strongest and surest ally and aid to sanitary progress and public health; then sanitation and hygiene will be comprehended and courted, instead of as now too frequently doubted and resented. The material deductions, and those most interesting to you as the local sanitary authority, derivable from experience in sanitary work, are that well made and well cleansed roads, good drainage, wholesome water, and the means for so preserving it, dwellings in good repair, with necessary sanitary requirements, are essential to, and practically synonimous with, a high standard of public health, good tenants, secure rents, few paupers, and low rates, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER.
