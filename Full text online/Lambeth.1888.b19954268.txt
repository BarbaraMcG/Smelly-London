During the year ending 25th March, 1889, there have been erected 67 ordinary Column Lamps and 4 Bracket Lamps, 7 Column Lamps have been discontinued, and 78 Column Lamps and 1 Bracket Lamp shifted to positions of greater utility, whilst in three cases Brackets have been replaced by Columns. In Norwood Road at the corner of Cemetery Road the ordinary Lamp has been replaced by a more powerful Lamp with reflecting top, and at the junction of the Chatsworth Road and Idmiston Road a similar improvement has been made. The following are particulars of the Lamps lighted and maintained at the expense of the Vestry on the 25th March, 1889. Gas Company's District.

This is attributable to the following reductions made by the Gas Companies, viz.:— Crystal Palace District Gas Company from £1 15s. 10d. to £3 14s. per lamp per annum, commencing from 30th September, 1888. South Metropolitan Gas Company from £1 7s. 4d. to £3 3s. 9d. per lamp per annum, and from 2/5 to 2/3 per 1000 feet, commencing from 26th December, 1888. All these reductions are subject to the usual discount of 5 per cent. The following is a comparative statement of the prices paid by the Vestry to the three Companies which supply the Parish:— Gas Light and Coke Co.—On actual consumption, according to meter, at 2s. 2d. per 1000 feet (3940 hours per annum, and 4.72 feet per hour per lamp), per lamp per annum £2 0 3 Lighting, Extinguishing, Cleaning, Painting, Repairing 0 18 0 £2 18 3 South Metropolitan Gas Co.— At per lamp per annum £3 3 9 Discount 5 per cent. allowed if paid within one month from Quarter-day 032 £307 31 Crystal Palace District Gas Co.— At per lamp per annum £3 14 0 Discount 5 per cent. allowed if paid within a month from Quarter-day 0 3 8 £3 10 4 The Gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company has been regularly tested by the Medical Officer, and the following is a summary of the Lighting Committee's Reports to the Vestry:— Gas Companies. Parliamentary Standard. Candles. Where tested. Average Illuminating Power. Candles. Tests for purity, Ammonia, and Sulphuretted Hydrogen. Gas Light and Coke l6 Vestry Hall 16.06 Free from Sulphuretted Hydrogen & Ammonia. Crystal Palace District 12 Sydenham Station 16.08 Ditto. The average Illuminating Power of the Gas supplied by the South Metropolitan Company, as tested at the various Testing Stations during the year ending 26th March, 1888, was shown to be above the Parliamentary Standard of 16 Candles. 32 PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The only Schemes for the Parliamentary Session of 1880, of which notices were given to the Vestry, were as follows:— 1. A Bill for continuing the existing Tramway lines on Brixton Hill from Water Lane to Telford Avenue. Certain conditions and stipulations were required by the Vestry and were assented to by the Company, the necessary alterations were made in the Bill during its progress through the House of Commons, and the Bill afterwards passed through both Houses. 2. The South Eastern Railway Company introduced a Bill to give them power to widen their Railway from Waterloo Bridge Road to Charing Cross. The Vestry presented a Petition against the Bill, asking that proper provisions should be inserted in the Bill to give the local Authorities authority as to the construction and maintenance of the bridges aud other works and for the payment of rates by the Company in respect of property destroyed until the new line and works should be completed and brought into rating. The Company opposed the locus standi of the Vestry before the Court of Referees, but the Court deeided against the Company, aud allowed the Vestry to appear and be heard on their Petition. The Bill did not come on before the Committee of the House of Commons prior to the end of the Parochial year. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Although several Electric Lighting Companies gave notice of an intention to apply for Paliamentary Powers to supply the whole or parts of the Parish of Lambeth with Electric Light, under the Electric Lighting Acts, only two Companies, viz. the London Electric Supply Corporation and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, actually deposited Draft Orders under the Act. In both cases the proposed area comprised the entire parish ; the Vestry decided in January, 1889, that the Vestry itself would not apply for a License or Order, but would oppose both Companies, with the view to obtain from one or other Company clauses to carry out the three main points considered by the Vestry to be essential, and such other protective clauses and provisions as might be deemed necessary in the interests of the Parish. The three main points desired by the Vestry were as follows:— (1.) That the Company should he bound to lay down mains and supply electricity in certain trunk streets within a definite time to be settled by the Order, and in side streets when required either by the Vestry or by a specified number of Owners or Occupiers in such streets, and 33 that on the breach by the Company of this condition the Order should be cancelled. (2.) That the cost of laying all mains in the public streets should be borne by tho Company. (3.) That all wires should be laid underground unless with the consent of tho Vestry. Tho Board of Trade appointed Major Marindin to hold an enquiry into all the Electric Lighting Schemes for London, and postponed the consideration of all tho Draft Orders until the Report of Major Marindin had been made. The Enquiry was appointed to commence on the 3rd April, 1889, at the Westminster Town Hall. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Under tho provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888 (51 and 52 Vict., Chapter 41), as from tho 1st April, 1889, or such earlier day as tho Local Government Board might order, all the powers and duties of the Metropolitan Board of AVorks created by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, were to bo transferred to tho London County Council, to be elected under the Act of 1888. By an order of the Local Government Board, dated the 19th March, 1889, the 21st March, 1889, was appointed as the day for the transfer to take effect, and on that day the Metropolitan Board ceased to exist, and the London County Council took over its duties and held its first Meeting. PUBLIC LIBRARIES. In February, 1889, Messrs. Caine, Lawrence, and Gent-Davis Commisisiouers retired by ballot; Messrs.

With reference to the work tarried out by the Vestry, the Expenditure shown hy Wharf account is about £400 less than previous year, which is accounted for by the purchase of plant and difference in prices of Fodder in the year ending March, 1888. It will be seen by the Tabulated, Statement the last year's Watering is much less, and the Slopping more than previous year, the consumption of Water, as shown by the General Purposes account is for 1888, .£2692, and for 1889, £2183, making a difference of <£5')9. An important alteration has been made in collecting the house dust in a portion of the Parish. Pails have been supplied to the houses, and the use of the dust bins generally discontinued ; the Carts collect the dust twice in the week, so there is no accumulation to become a nuisance as under the former system of keeping the stuff until the bin was full. The alteration is very favorably regarded by the people, and difficulty of bringing the work into system and control is completely got over by the new pails. The people who have not been supplied, and are still dependent upon their dust bins, are most anxious for the change. 39 VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF LAMBETH, AN ACCOUNT IN ABSTRACT, OF THE Receipts and Expenditure BY THE VESTRY, From 25th March, 1888, to 25th March, 1889, AND Of the Monies owing to and Debts and Liabilities incurred by the Vestry, on the 25th of March, 1889. 40 41 LIGHTING ACCOUNT, 1883-9. £ s. d. £ s. d.

WILLIAM STEVENS, GEORGE STEVENS, EDMUND M. HEMELD, Auditors. TO THE VESTRY OF THE Parish of Lambeth, 18 8 8. Thirty-third Annual Report OF THE 1 MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the year 1888 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. The vital statistics accompanying this Report arc based upon an estimated population of 281,935. In arriving at an approximate estimate of the actual population the natural :increase from the excess in the number of the births over that of the deaths is thought a safer guide than any deduction drawn from the augmentation which was ascertained to have taken place during the decade terminating in the last census year. The latter indication, adopted by the Registrar-General as a basis of calculation, gives a larger return. Having reference, however, to the parish of Lambeth, the adoption of a more modest estimate lessens the risks of exaggeration. Whether or no the presumption that the growth during the years following 1881 has maintained the same ratio as during the decade antecedent to that year, an opinion entertained by E 2 the Registrar-General, be in accordance with fact, or whether that growth has been in a reduced ratio, can only be ascertained when the next census is taken. I am inclined, however, to adopt the latter view. It is a matter of regret amongst those the most interested in sanitary matters, that ten years should be allowed to intervene between each official enumeration of the population. When that period is approaching its term, any estimate, however carefully prepared, may in a large measure either be in advance or fall behind the actual figures. It is needless to say that such a basis, and the one upon which all health and sanitary statistics must be founded, is unreliable. The organisation of a quinquennial census would result in securing a closer approximation to truth in these estimates. In order as far as possible to exclude any element of inaccuracy from the death statistics, the record of the deaths of parishioners who die in extra-parochial institutions and that of those who, although they be not parishioners, yet die in the public institutions of Lambeth, is noted, the one to be added to and the other deducted from the returns proper to the district. The Staff of Sanitary Inspectors. The question of the appointment of additional Inspectors upon the Sanitary Staff has already been discussed. A resolution embodied in a Report coming down from your Sanitary Committee has introduced the subject to the notice of your Vestry. The Committee had considered at some length the condition of the Department in respect to the duties it was called upon to perform, and the relative strength of its Staff. The two quantities were found to be disproportionatc, and a scheme of reorganization involving the appointment of additional Inspectors and a clerical assistant was submitted to the approval of your Vestry. The 3 recommendation of that Report in its entirety your Vestry did not adopt. But by the appointment of a clerk, whose duty it would be to relieve the Inspectors of their clerical work, the principle advanced by the Committee received a recognition. This concession on the part of the Vestry, although not fulfilling the purpose held in view by the Committee, has been followed by excellent results; results which may be observed in the greater efficiency of the Department. Whether or no the question should receive the further attention of your Vestry, may be decided by a consideration of the bearing of the facts which I find it consistent with my duty to lay before you. As far as it may be ascertained byan examination ofthecondition of the Sanitary departments of the Metropolitan Vestries, the provision made for the needs of the several parishes is not based upon the observation of any uniform principle. A district comprising a population of 9,000 inhabitants, in some quarters is regarded as affording a field sufficiently extensive to engage the attention and energy of the Inspector; whilst in another parish, a district comprising 105,000 is not considered too large. Between these extreme ranges, inspectorial areas containing a population numbering 20,000, 40,000, and 80,000 are found. If the size of a parish may be gauged by the number of houses contained within the limits of its boundary, Lambeth is the largest parish of the Metropolitan group. But if population be regarded as the test, the parish of Islington takes precedence. No remarkable inequality exists, however, between the two great parishes either in the size of population or the number of rateable householders.* The one on the *Population Census returns 1881, Lambeth 253,699, Islington 282,865. Rated Householders 1888, Lambeth 34,910, Islington 34,327. E 2 4 north side and the other on the south, their geographical position in relation to the centre of the Metropolitan area is not dissimilar. And in the condition of life of their inhabitants they bear a resemblance. In each there is a large middle class and a large working class. In neither is there a great body of the very rich, and in neither a great body of the very poor. Bearing so many points of resemblance the two parishes are favourably adapted for the purposes of comparison. A few years ago the staffs of Lambeth and Islington were numerically equal. To each Inspector in the one a population of 65,000 was apportioned. To each in the other a population of 70,000. But Islington has reorganized its Department and added to the number of its Inspectors, whilst in Lambeth the question of reorganization has not yet assumed definite shape. These two parishes, so much alike in the size of their populations and in the number of their inhabited houses, have become widely dissimilar in the strength of their Sanitary Departments. The Comparative Strength of the Sanitary Departments of Lambeth and Islington, 1888. Lambeth. One Chief Inspector. Three District Inspectors. One Clerk. Islington. One Chief Inspector. Eight District Inspectors. Four Clerks. These figures afford food for reflection. They point to a belief that either the staff of Islington is too large, or the staff of Lambeth is too small. But although the means of satisfying the needs of a parish may be conjectured by making a comparison with the provision made in others, especially when a fair parallel may be drawn, they are rather to be estimated from the examination of conditions not extraneous to the parish itself. 3 Since the year 1871, when the last addition was made to the staff of your Sanitary Inspectors, the growth of the parish of Lambeth has been continuous. In the older districts, where no room remains for further development, the houses already occupying the ground arc used for the accommodation of a greater number of families. The growth in the outer wards is more apparent. The land which lay between and separated the detached districts has been converted into building estate, intersected with streets, and covered with houses. Loughboro' and Herne Hill on the one side, and Vauxhall and Stockwell on the other, have become conterminous with Brixton, and that which was formerly an isolated suburb is now regarded as the business centre of South London. This change in the condition of the parish has been accompanied by a growth no less remarkable. The education of public opinion upon questions relating to health has kept pace with the advances made in Sanitary Science; especially are the upper and middle classes more conscious of the advantages derived from sanitary dwellings, and less patient in tolerating the existence of a nuisance either upon their own premises or that of their neighbour. The growth of opinion is manifest in the increasing number of demands made upon the Sanitary Department, formerly the aid of the Inspector was seldom invoked. Now every post brings with it batches of requests bearing upon the subject of drain defects, drain testing, and drain reconstruction. Moreover it has become a custom with parishioners before entering upon a purchase or lease to make an application at the office for a preliminary inspection of the premises. A mode of Sanitary administration considered efficient twenty years ago by every Metropolitan Vestry would scarce meet with the approval or indeed escape the censure of the parishioner of to-day. The Inspector was an unskilled 6 Workman holding that which might almost be regarded as a sinecure office, an official recruited into the service of the Vestry from the ranks of ex-sailors, ex-policemen, or army pensioners. He brought with him a character for honesty and sobriety, and his appearance was such as would admit him as a candidate where youth was a quality having weight with the Committee of Selection. A knowledge upon sanitary matters acquired from a course of technical training was not expected from him. No greater accomplishment than the art involved in writing a letter or the ability displayed in reading it was put forward as a qualification by the candidate, or regarded as a recommendation by his employers. A close application for a few weeks to the work of his district, and a few hints from his older associates in office, afforded him a sufficient fund of assurance and official mannerism to follow the routine of his duty with satisfaction to himself, his Vestry and his Parish. But with the advances in sanitary science, and a more extended appreciation of sanitary principles, this view of the qualifications and duties of a Sanitary Inspector is no longer entertained. Builders, plumbers, and the heterogenous body of workmen engaged in connection with sanitary work, are not long in estimating at its proper worth the practical ability of the man whose instructions it is their duty to follow ; nor are they slow in finding means to evade the supervision and directions of a chief whose opinions they have learned to despise. Although perhaps not deeply versed in sanitary matters, the ratepayers and the workmen alike look for the presence among them of a man who, having a practical knowledge of his profession, can speak with authority. But the Inspector of to-day is a man highly trained and skilled in plumbing, drain-laying, and the allied handicrafts 7 and other technical duties of his profession. By their devotion to duty the Inspectors of Lambeth may be said to have acquired that skill which was not looked for in their earlier years of office. The work of the Sanitary Inspector is divided into two classes. In the one are scheduled all those duties relating to the maintenance of the parish in a sanitary condition, as the systematic inspection of the public schools, Board and parochial, the bakehouses and manufactories, the dairies and cow-houses, the slaughter houses and public mews, the dust yards and the brickfields, the registered lodging houses and the model dwellings: to maintain in operation the Sale of Food and Drugs Act; to effect, either by arrangement at home or by removal to the hospitals of the Asylum Board, the isolation of the infected sick; to secure the removal, the disinfection, and the return of infected bedding and clothes; to conduct the disinfection of infected premises; to attend to the letters of complaint which reach the office from the inhabitants of the several districts in respect to the existence of nuisances, whether referring to dirty premises, stopped drains, the overcrowding of tenements, offensive accumulations, trade nuisances, dangerous structures, or animals improperly kept. The other class relates to works which are carried out with the object of effecting a permanent improvement in the sanitary condition of the parish. It includes all works of a structural character. It therefore comprises: The disconnexion and reconstruction of drains. The removal of traps and other sanitary appliances of an obsolete and inefficient sort and their replacement by those of a more perfect pattern. The rebuilding or repair of dilapidated houses. The paving and draining of yards and areas. The provision of a sufficient water supply, and all other matters 8 which may properly come under the designation of improvement works. These deal with nuisances perhaps of the most injurious order. There is no nuisance so great as the contamination of the air of the living room and the sleeping room with sewer gas. There is nothing so destructive of energy, so dangerous to health or even to life, nor in the whole range of sanitary work is there anything more complete, more lasting, or more satisfactory than the remedy. When the drains arc laid in concrete and trapped with stoneware gullies, when the yards arc paved with stone or a thick layer of concrete upon a firm foundation, when the materials are of a good quality, and when during the progress of the work there is efficient superintendence as far as drainage and paving are concerned, the house will remain in a sanitary condition as long as the bricks and mortar of the walls hold together. The two classes of work differ essentially from each other upon this one important point, the effect of the one is temporary, the other permanent. That the sanitary condition of the parish be maintained by the removal of offensive accumulation, the cleansing of houses, and the disinfection of premises, is proper and necessary. But the work is not of that kind requiring the technical skill essential in the other. It is of a lower order, and, unlike the structural work, does not result in a lasting improvement. Yet notwithstanding the advantage, sanitary and economical, resulting from the employment of the time of the Inspector in the superintendence of structural work ; when the Department is undermanned the structural work is that which of necessity must be neglected. There are matters engaging the Inspector's attention in which procrastination ol neglect would be immediately followed by a sufficiently apparent result. The daily batch of complaints must be 9 attended to. Isolation in infectious disease, and disinfection at its termination, must be carried out. The periodical inspection of slaughter houses and cow-houses, dairies and bakehouses may not be neglected. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act must be maintained in operation. When all these matters have received a proper share of consideration ; when notices have been served, and in due course the issue of summonses has followed; when time is spent in the Police Court in applications for summonses, in first hearings, in adjournments, in second hearings for the recovery of penalties, and in adjournments on account of vexatious proceedings on the part of the defendant; then, and not until then, may the Inspector having sole charge of a large district commence the work of house to house inspection, and devote his energy to structural improvements. The precedence given, and which must be given, to the least important class of inspectorial duties, results in the shelving of that class which requires in its performance the greatest skill, the largest amount of technical knowledge, and is followed by the most satisfactory results. When I speak of satisfactory results I use that word in its larger sense. No work engages the attention of the sanitarian that has a more beneficial effect upon the community than that which devotes itself to the improvement of the dwellings of the working classes. Such an improvement indeed often awakens among the people a pride in cleanliness, which before had laid dormant. The effect of the development of the cleanly habit may be observed in districts in which the Sanitary Inspector has left behind him a trail sufficiently recognisable in paved courts and yards and perfected sanitary appliances. When the muddy surfaces adjacent to the doors of the cottage have been renovated by the provision of a smooth and impervious paving, when surfaces that can be cleansed by the use of the scrubbing 10 brush replace the indescribable material of which an unpaved yard is composed, it is instructive to notice with what eagerness the scrubbing brush is applied. Again and again have I witnessed a dirty court, full of dirty people, transformed by a small outlay on the part of the landlord into a thrifty and pleasant place. Landlords are never tired of complaining of the improvident habits of their tenants, their destructive proclivities, and their filthy ways, and in some districts of the parish they arc not without reason for their complaint. But these gentlemen should remember that the remedy often lies in their own hands. Habits destructive alike to their own interest, to that of the tenant, and the parish at large, are engendered, fostered, and exaggerated by the neglect of the property owner. A dilapidated house, with defective drains and filthy surroundings, will certainly exert an influence, and that not of a beneficial character, upon the occupier. As cleanly and healthful surroundings lead to an elevation in the moral nature, as surely do the filthy and unwholesome lead to its decay. The existence of a few badly paved, badly drained and insanitary dwellings will often result in the lapse into a lower tone of the inhabitants of the whole court. More than once I have been told that the expense incurred at the instance of the Vestry by the landlord in house improvement has been more than recouped from the resulting alacrity on the part of the tenant to meet his engagements, and property which before was a constant scene of discontent and eviction, from the improved relations which have been established between owner and occupier afterwards, has been regarded as furnishing a sound return upon the capital investment. The houses of the working classes of Lambeth, although probably in a better sanitary condition than dwellings of a 11 similar description in many other parts of the Metropolis, require and will still continue to require the attention and consideration of your Vestry. The work accomplished by your Sanitary Inspector in this class of property during recent years is excellent of its kind, but the reconstruction of drainage demands close supervision and the expenditure of much time upon the part of the Inspector. Unless the Inspector be prepared to assure himself of the efficiency of the work performed by daily superintendence during its progress, and by examination and test upon its completion, little advantage is derived from inspection or the service of the Vestry Notice. The men employed by the owner are frequently incompetent workmen. When left to follow their own course without close superintendence, pipes are laid with 1 faulty connexions, with gradients dipping in the wrong direction, defects resulting at no distant time in the saturation of the earth with sewage matter, and the escape of deleterious gases. From considerations such as these, it becomes obvious that the work of structural improvement must proceed slowly, and indeed periodical house to house inspection, which, with the assistance of a larger staff, might with great advantage to the health of the parish be extended to all dwellings, must now of necessity be limited to those streets and courts which are considered by the Medical Officer either on account of disease incidence or other urgent cause, the most deserving of attention. Since the year 1871, 70,000 persons have been added to the population of Lambeth. The annual rateable value has increased by 63 per cent., or a sum estimated at £600,000. 20,000 houses are now occupied by the working classes, and more than an equal number by parishioners in 11101c comfortable circumstances. This accession to the work of the Department has not been accompanied by any change in the 12 composition of the staff of sanitary inspectors. In 1871 their number was four, in 1888 their number remains the same. By the employment of men to assist in the work of the Department, formerly from time to time and at irreguiai intervals, latterly without interruption, your Medical Officer has endeavoured to counteract the defects in the constitution of the Department. But having regard to the reasons already advanced, and in order that the health of the parish may be maintained by the efficient performance of the duties in respect of which the Sanitary Department is responsible, I venture to ask your Vestry to take into its consideration the present condition of the Department, the work it is called upon to perform, and the means which are at its disposal to conduct that work in a manner satisfactory to its Officers, your Vestry and the Parish. Smallpox and Vaccination. If any apology be needed for raising a discussion upon the well-worn subject of vaccination at a time when of all others it would appear that measures for the prevention or mitigation of Small Pox are the least in demand, the absence of panic and the usual disturbances of mind inseparable from a season of epidemic would be a sufficient excuse. For several years, in common with other districts of the metropolitan area, Lambeth has enjoyed a measure of immunity from Small Pox. Since the last general outbreak the cases reported have been few in number and separated from one another by long lapses of time. The history of the disease does not afford us, however, any reasonable assurance of the indefinite prolongation of this already unusually prolonged interval. Indeed, the history of small pox is a history of surprises. An interval of immunity has always been brought to an 13 unexpected close by the appearance of the disease in an epidemic form. An interval of unwarranted confidence has invariably been succeeded by a season of panic. But even common prudence has not been purchased by a century of experience. Now, as in times gone by, each outbreak in turn is regarded as the final flicker of a dying ember, and with the general acceptance of this belief precautionary measures arc either relaxed or abandoned. It shows a peculiar and contradictory phase in human nature, when a people, remarkable alike for common sense and business capacity, and eminent among others in qualities of prudence and foresight, should be among the last by legislative enactment to adopt, and the first by popular consent to relax, the use of a measure which has saved thousands of their countrymen from a miserable existence or an untimely death. But yet this popular tendency to relaxation in the employment of preventive measures is not altogether a sign of loss of faith in the value of those measures. When an epidemic is looming in the distance, or the danger of infection is at the threshold, many who before had been negligent seek protection, and many who, until now, stood aloof among the ranks of the anti-vaccinationists are observed in making rapid strides towards the camp of the other party. The man who delays building a shelter until he is alarmed by the gathering clouds, will indeed be fortunate if he escape the effects of the storm. The habit of procrastination, and the lack of common prudence, are factors which, during epidemic periods, largely tend to swell the death rate. Yet besides those to whom reference has been made, there is a large number of people who entertain honest doubts upon the value of vaccination as a preventive measure. This section is aware of the almost universal support the principle 14 receives from scientific men. They know the operation has obtained the sanction of Parliament, and its general adoption has been rendered compulsory by a series of legislative acts. But on the other hand they have heard of a protest raised by a body of men both in and out of Parliament. A body, although insignificant in size, one which acquires no little importance from the perseverance of its members, and from the energy displayed in the dissemination of its doctrines. The anti-vaccinationists have had the satisfaction of making themselves heard. They have also succeeded in unsettling the minds of not a few people, who, unacquainted with the history of the operation and the nature of the disease which called it into being, are influenced by arguments they have not the means to controvert, and figures the accuracy of which they are not in a position to dispute. The enquiry instituted by the Local Government Board during the recent epidemic of small pox at Sheffield supplies in its published record a wealth of material bearing upon this question of the value of vaccination. From this source, during the course of this Report and in pursuance of my present object, I shall largely draw, in order that I may bring to the notice of those who care to be informed evidence of the most accurate and conclusive character. During the year 1796 vaccination was introduced by Edward Jenner. In the days of bad roads and stage coaches communication between distant places was difficult. News travelled slowly. New modes of treatment were received by an ignorant and prejudiced public with distrust. Yet before the first decade of the nineteenth century had closed, vaccination was practised in every important city in Europe and America, and the name of Jenner had become a household word throughout the civilized world. In the history of discovery nothing is recorded, either before or after, which 15 has created an impression so general or profound. People living at the latter end of the nineteenth century, unacquainted with small pox in its eighteenth century dress, find a difficulty in comprehending the magnitude of the service rendered, or the display of gratitude with which that service was received. To understand the nature of the benefit conferred upon the human race by Edward Jenner, I we should acquaint ourselves with the condition under which I the people of his day lived. Small pox was then the scourge of mankind. Dreaded alike by all classes of men, no age or condition in life was exempt from attack. A number probably exceeding three-fourths of the population had already suffered.* The remainder hourly awaited an attack. Fully one-tenth of the people bore upon their faces the imprint of the disease. Blindness and a repulsive distortion of feature were common characteristics. The disease when acquired by artificial means was generally believed to be milder in type than when introduced by the ordinary channels of infection. But disfigurement and death sometimes succeeded inoculation, and those who submitted themselves to the operation were aware of the danger to which they were exposed. Nevertheless, in order that they might escape from a position rendered unbearable through the terror of suspense, many were found who voluntarily sought a condition of immunity through suffering. The practice of inoculation became popular. Hospitals that should receive within their walls these voluntary sufferers were established and endowed. But, notwithstanding the amount of suffering, notwithstanding the immunity purchased by that suffering, inflammable material was always present among the population in a sufficient quantity to maintain a perennial conilagration. * In Chester, in the year 1775, a population existed of 14,713, of whom only 1060, or seven per cent., had not passod through an attack.—McVail- 16 Let anyone who entertains a doubt upon the prevalence of Small Pox during the last century consult the records handed down to us in the Bills of Mortality both of London and the great Continental towns. In the year 1723, Dr. Jurin, the President of the Royal Society, asserts that Small Pox destroys a fourteenth part of mankind. Later we find Dr. Lettsom, also a President of the Royal Society, making a statement in regard to London and its environs at a time when the population was barely one million. From this disease, he declares three thousand in every year die. The significance attaching to this statement when interpreted into language applicable to the conditions existing in the metropolis of to-day, allows us to indulge in a striking comparison. Taking into consideration the extent of the present population, did we live under the same conditions in regard to small pox mortality now as then, we might confidently expect an annual occurrence of 18,000 deaths. Yet again we learn from the eminent statistician Dr. Farr, that the annual mortality from small pox among every million persons living, amounted during the twenty years ending 1679 to 4170, during the thirty years ending 1757 to 4260, and during the ten years ending 1780 to 5020. These figures relate to the annual mortality alone, they do not speak of the deformities resulting from that disease in those who recovered. They do not tell of deafness and of blindness, nor of that disfigurement of feature which to many would come in a more hideous guise than death itself. When we turn our attention to extracts from the bills of mortality preserved in continental countries, a result no less imposing is observed. The Medical Officer to the Privy Council, Mr. Simon, has collected some figures from this trustworthy source which illustrate the prevalence of the disease at the close of the 17 last century. The numbers refer to the annual death rate per million of the living population. Berlin is credited with 3422 per million, Sweden 2050, Moravia 5402, whilst Silesia is remarkable with 5812, and Trieste with an enormous small pox death rate of 14,046. Whilst Small Pox was claiming its victims at home and abroad unfettered by natural boundaries and unrestrained by anything human skill could devise; in a small and obscure village of Gloucestershire, Edward Jenner was engaged in a scries of experiments upon lymph derived from the udder of the cow. With the farmers and villagers among whom he practised his profession a tradition was current and probably repeated often enough in his hearing concerning the antagonism existing between cow pox and small pox. Sayings of this character upon many other subjects were doubtless common in the village community. Country folkare often keen observers of nature. The folk-lore current among them represents the result of the crude observation of many generations crystallized by age into trite and many times into rhyming phrases. Serving sometimes as a guide to action, sometimes as a warning against danger, the folklore of the country often contains a solid substratum of wisdom. It was from folk-lore that vaccination derived its origin. Jenner had not only heard the .tradition, but he had determined to search for the kernel of truth lying hidden in the husks which enveloped that tradition. He had already observed how some engaged in dairy work had escaped infection even in the presence of an epidemic of unusual severity. He had noticed a peculiar and painful disease often contracted by the milkers, which declared itself by the appearance of a sore upon the hand. His attention had also been directed to the occasional occurrence pf an eruption upon the udder of the cow, to which he f 18 attributed the origin of the milkers' sore. Connecting these circumstances together in his mind he arrived at a definite conclusion. He was convinced that the immunity from small pox enjoyed by the milkers resulted from a previous inoculation by cow pox; an inoculation accidentally accomplished by contact with the diseased animal. Jenner did not arrive at this conviction until after years had been passed in careful experiment and laborious research. His chief service to mankind consists rather, then, in having converted into a practical channel the result of the experience of previous generations of illiterate observers, than in the inauguration of a new discovery. After Jenner had made known to the world the results of his investigations, vaccination came rapidly into repute. A Royal Jennerian Society was founded in the year 1802; within eighteen months of its institution 12,000 persons had been vaccinated. Six years had scarcely passed, when vaccination had become a general practice over the whole world. It was accepted alike by nations of every clime, habit, and religion. In Geneva and Holland its adoption was advocated from the pulpit. In Germany, the anniversary of Jenner's birthday was celebrated with the rejoicings significant of a feast day. In Russia, the court, in commemoration of the occasion, endowed the child upon whom vaccination had first been practised, with an education provided at the public cost. At Naples, with religious observance and solemn rite, surpliced processions, bearing the insignia of the Church, did honour to the name of the benefactor. From among the European and Native Races of India a Subscription amounting to over £8000 was raised and presented to the English physician. In England, with unanimous consent, Parliament voted for Jenner's private purse a sum of 19 £10,000, afterwards increased to £30,000. An incident, at the time of little importance in itself, illustrates the esteem in which Jenner was held. Napoleon the First had detained as prisoners a number of Englishmen, and Jenner had Written, praying for their release. Buona parte read the letter, and, with others of its kind, was about to consign it to the waste paper basket, when, observing Jenner's signature at the foot, he turned to his minister, saying, "I cannot refuse anything to one bearing that name, we must let the prisoners go." An account of these incidents in the history of the early times of vaccination is introduced for no other purpose than to show the position of esteem and regard in which the name of Jenner was held. And surely the people of his time, acquainted with the conditions existing both before and after the introduction of vaccination, had opportunities now beyond our reach of forming a judgment upon the value of vaccination. That they held in high estimation the services rendered to humanity by Edward Jenner is sufficiently patent from the record of the honours showered upon him by the grateful inhabitants of every civilized country. The evidence of those in a position to judge from personal observation the immediate advantages following the introduction of vaccination, must count for something in the scale when weighing the merits and demerits of that operation. But fortunately we are in possession of papers which hand down to us definite facts endorsing that evidence. To the bills of mortality reference has already been made. These documents were written for parochial purposes; their authority is removed from any suspicion of bias. In characters sometimes almost obliterated by age, and in monotonous detail, they bear record to a yearly recurring mortality largely exceeding f 2 20 that which in our century appertains to the isolated and infrequent periods of the greater epidemics. The figures indeed stand out as a lasting proof of the blow vaccination has dealt to a disease of whose remorseless hunger these dusty records bear witness. Appended is a table of the London death rate from Small Pox per million, calculated for the period before registration was in operation, by the able statistician Di. Farr, together with the recorded figures of a later time. The rates before and after the introduction of vaccination are compared in parallel columns. Before Introduction of Vaccination.

Although fragmentary they sufficiently reflect the conditions existing before and after the introduction of Vaccination. It was in the last decade of the eighteenth century that Jenner announced his discovery, From that time is observed a rapid but steady decline in the mortality, a decline which in the recorded rate has converted thousands into hundreds, hundreds into tens, and tens into units. Contemporaneous with the appearance in England of a declining death rate, a similar condition is observable in Continental countries. 21 Mortality from Small Pox upon the Continent before and after the introduction of Vaccination. *Terms of years respecting which particulars are given.

That change must have resulted either from a modification in the virulency of the Small Pox poison or from an increased capacity for resistance exhibited by the human subject. To which of these entities in the problem may the remarkable shrinkage in the death rate be attributed ? That the change is not due to an attenuation of the poison is obvious from an examination of the death rate among the unvaccinated, for since the period of the introduction of vaccination the death rate among this section has risen. In the year 1726, taking as a basis for calculation a list of 17,151 cases, the President of the Royal Society, Dr. Jurin, estimates the percentage of deaths among those who contract the disease at 16.6. In 1763, and for the seventeen years previous to this date, the mortality in the London Small Pox Hospitals was estimated at 25 per cent., and in the last quarter of the century at 32 per cent. From 1835 to 1865, Mr. Marson, from the analysis of cases occurring at the London Hospitals, discovers that 35.5 of the unvaccinated died. Whilst a later authority, Dr. Gayton, in a digest of 10,000 cases treated by himself, shows a death rate among the unvaccinated of 43 per cent.; and finally, as a result of the inquiry by the Inspector of the Local Government Board, Dr. Barry, at Sheffield during the epidemic of 1888, the percentage of deaths among the unvaccinated was 31.1. Death Late per cent. from Small Pox among unvaccinated. Before introduction of Vaccination. 16.6, 25.0, 32.0. After introduction of Vaccination. 35.5, 43.0, 31.1 23 From this analysis of the death rate of the unvaccinated section of the community, it is evident that Small Pox is at least as severe when it attacks the unprotected to-day as in pre-vaccination times. But there are two causes alone to which the shrinkage in the death rate from Small Pox can be attributed. Either the poison of the disease has become less intense, or the human body less susceptible to the influence of the poison. Either the bullet is dispatched with lessened impetus, or the armoured plating has acquired an improved resisting power. In regard to the former of these two contentions a direct negative has been proved. We are called upon, then, to accept the alternative theory. But whilst some admit that the body is more efficiently protected now than formerly, they contend that this condition results rather from the effects of improved sanitary administration than from vaccination. But an insurmountable difficulty stands in the way of the acceptance of this proposition. For if we assume that sanitation be the protective influence, we must be prepared to show that both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated alike derive an equal share of protection. But it has been shown that the unvaccinated when coming within the range of attack are subject to a larger rate of mortality than formerly. The contention that sanitation is the protective influence breaks down. The conclusion to which we are driven confirms the opinion held in the days of Jenner. Vaccination confers upon those who are subjected to its agency a protective influence effective in lessening the severity of the attack, and in reducing the mortality from Small Pox. In the years 1887 and 1888, when Small Pox in epidemic form invaded Sheffield, the population consisted of four distinct sections, distinguished from one another by welldefined characteristics. 24 18,121 had already suffered from Small Pox. 63,654 bad been twice vaccinated. 186,622 had been once vaccinated. 5,715 had never been vaccinated. For the purposes of comparison these sections may be regarded as separate populations. Living together, intermingled in the same town, they enjoyed the same advantages from sanitation, and were exposed to similar influences of infection. It is interesting to notice whether or no Small Pox attacked the several sections with an equal degree of severity, especially having reference to those which differ from each other in regard to the presence or absence of the protective influence afforded by vaccination. To illustrate this point the disease rate which actually occurred is appended to the description of each section. The section every member of which had already suffered from Small Pox, for every thousand of its population had 1.3 individuals attacked. The twice vaccinated section, for every thousand of its population had 3 individuals attacked. The once vaccinated section, for every thousand of its population had 19 individuals attacked. The unvaccinated section, for every thousand of its population had 94 individuals attacked. These figures speak for themselves. In the presence of an epidemic, we observe Small Pox tracking out and decimating that portion of the population unprotected either by vaccination or previous attack. Let us now observe what effect the dissimilarity existing between the sections in regard to protective influence has upon the relative death rate. The section every member of which had already suffered from Small Pox lost 3 persons by 25 death in every 10,000 of its population; the twice vaccinated section lost 1 person by death in every 10,000 of its population ; the once vaccinated section lost 10 persons by death in every 10,000 of its population; and the unvaccinated section lost 510 persons by death in every 10,000 of its population. During the course of the epidemic, in the eight registration districts of Sheffield a census of the population inhabiting the houses invaded by Small Pox was taken. Both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated were included in the returns. A population of 4756 children below the age of ten years was discovered in these houses. When drawing a comparison between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, in order to arrive at a just appreciation of the value of vaccination, no other period of life supplies so fair a test as the first decade. We are able to obtain information in regard to vaccination from the parents of children, and from the inspecting officers, which at a later period of life would be unattainable. Nor, in this age period, has sufficient time elapsed for the influence of vaccination to wear away. It must be remembered that this child population was living in the houses invaded by Small Pox, and therefore in close relationship with people who were actually suffering from the disease, and consequently at some time or other a large proportion of them were exposed to infection. In North Sheffield sub-district 992 children had been vaccinated, 71 took Small Pox, and after an illness of 110 great severity recovered. Inhabiting the same houses, living under the same conditions, and exposed to the same influences, 65 children were scheduled upon the returns, grouped together for no other reason than that they differed from the others in never having been vaccinated. Among 2 6 this unvaccinated element all were infected with the exception of 6, and 26 died. It might be urged by those unwilling to concede any point to the advocates of vaccination that special circumstances perchance existed which militated against the unvaccinated section, and hence the death rate should be regarded as incidental. Taking note of this objection, let us proceed to compare the disease rate and mortality of the two classes in another sub-district, Sheffield Park. Here we find 334 vaccinated children, 24 from among this group contract Small Pox and all recover. But in the unvaccinated class are 9 children, every one of these become infected, and only 3 out of the 9 recover. 780 vaccinated children live in the invaded houses of the Nether Hallam sub-district, among these 56 are attacked and all recover. But in the same district are 35 unvaccinated children, 31 of these take Small Pox and 8 die. In the Sub-district Brightside 829 vaccinated children reside, 67 of these become infected and 2 deaths occur. But in this district 32 of the unvaccinated class live. All of these contract Small Pox, and 15, nearly half their number, die. In the Ecclesall district the vaccinated child population in the invaded houses is 772, among them 65 are attacked and 2 die. But in the unvaccinated class are 39 children, 32 of these suffer and 13 die. The vaccinated class in the Attercliffie district number 274, one death results among the 19 attacked. The unvaccinated class number 24 children, 17 are attacked and in 8 the attack is fatal. 27 The evidence from the South Sheffield and West Sheffield districts corresponds with that from the other districts already enumerated. In the former, 184 constitute the vaccinated class, 23 of these are seized with Small Pox but all recover. Whilst the unvaccinated class consist of 24 children, of these are seized and in 10 the seizure results in death. In the latter, namely in the West Sheffield district, 301 belong to the vaccinated class, 28 take Small Pox and 1 dies. In the unvaccinated class are 34 children, 31 become infected and 14 of these children die. Census of Invaded Houses, including number of Attacks and number of Deaths.

In pursuance of the object of this enquiry let us now consider the relative severity of the disease when contracted by the vaccinated and unvaccinated, still confining our attention to children under the age of ten years. In the Borough Hospital, Winter Street, Sheffield, the cases of the vaccinated class admitted were all of a mild type, whilst 81 per cent. of the unvaccinated who had contracted the disease suffered from it in a severe form. In the Sheffield Union Workhouse Hospital, whilst 12 per cent. of the vaccinated were severe cases, the same might be said of 64 per cent. of the unvaccinated. But perhaps the most significant view of relative severity among vaccinated and unvaccinated is that supplied by the death 29 Site. For every 100,000 vaccinated children, the rate of small xox mortality actually observed in Sheffield gives 9 deaths, lor every 100,000 unvaccinated children the rate of small pox Mortality actually observed gives 4400 deaths. There is one section of the Sheffield population, previously Noticed, which deserves, from its importance, to receive a little further consideration. I refer to the re-vaccinated section. During the years 1887 and 1888, 56,233 persons were revaccirated. A portion of this class were living in invaded houses,and rionsequently were exposed to the direct influence of infection, dow does this section compare with the unvaccinated class ? rt will be remembered that the unvaccinated numbered 6556 of all ages, that 1028 of these were seized with Small Pox, and in the course of their illness 320 died. The revaccinated section constitutes a body eight times the size of the unvacinated. Its members were inhabiting the same bouses, living under the same conditions, and exposed to the same nfluences, yet out of this vast number two only were affected. And their illness was of a type so mild, that in the official leturns the disease was designated as "doubtful." These observations, reflecting the conditions existing during the epidemic period in the several sub-districts ot Sheffield, taken with the minutest accuracy of detail, and recorded with impartiality, show upon their face conclusive Evidence of the remarkable protective influence resulting from vaccination, and like a number of witnesses bearing corroborative evidence with monotonous repetition of circumstance they alike point to one conclusion. Among those who recognise the value of vaccination in affording protection from Small Pox, and, when complete immunity is wanting, in mitigating the severity of the attapk, not a few are found who dissent *The Class hero mentioned is exclusively that in which revaccination was oexformed during 1887 and 1888. 30 altogether from the principle of compulsion. Any neglec upon the part of the parent in securing for his children the protection afforded by vaccination is viewed by them as: failure in parental duty and as a misfortune. But the inter ference with the liberty of the subject involved in the administration and operation of the Acts is regarded as an evil of a greater magnitude. With a system of popular government the representative adopting this attitude does no lack support from a considerable section of the community moved by feelings of a sentimental character against vacci nation. Those who have witnessed the course of recen elections are aware of the pressure brought to bear upon parliamentary candidates by a section of the constituencie dominated by anti-vaccinationist proclivities, and must have observed an increasing tendency on the part of would-b members to conciliate that faction with pledges in favour repeal. But whatever methods are employed by the anti vaccinationists, either in gaining the sympathy of the people or the pledges of their representatives, they have signall failed as yet in making good their case by argument. Neithe have they shown that compulsion in the administration the Vaccination Acts, either in principle or in practice, i inconsistent with the enjoyment of the fullest measure freedom. Before the introduction of the Factory Acts, stranger visiting the manufacturing towns in the north of England were struck with the aspect of the inhabitants. The working classes were dwarfed in stature and were sickly in appea ance. The children lacked childish ways. Their faces boad traces of toil and suffering. With those who were acquainte with the life and habits of these children their prematurel aged expression of countenance was not a matter of surprise Except at infrequent intervals, their lives were spent in the 31 eavy atmosphere of the factory amid the ceaseless din of nachinery. These children worked at a monotonous occusation for twelve, fourteen, or even eighteen hours a day. Government at length intervened between parent and child, and the Factory Acts were passed. Under the parental control of the State, resulting in restricted hours of labour, he physical condition of the manufacturing population improved. In standing between the ignorance of the parent and the helplessness of the child, the State cannot honestly e accused of having narrowed the bounds of freedom. But Small Pox inflicts upon the unprotected infant populaion a more serious injury than that resulting from the jxactions of a hard factory master. And the State, when insisting that the child shall enjoy the protection which accination affords, is again only assuming that parental control essential for the protection of a helpless section of he community. There is another reason rendering the intervention of the State desirable. The person unprotected by vaccination may at any moment become a source of danger to the ' community. The effects of a single operation, it has already been shown, are not of a permanent character, and since evaccination is only submitted to by a fractional proporion of the population, there exists at all times a large imount of inflammable material. The unvaccinated element s like so much dry tinder interspersed throughout the mass, eady to ignite when brought into contact with the smallest park of infection. Some of our large epidemics are raceable in their origin to this cause. In our own parish, at /auxhall, an outbreak, including in its range several hundreds >f victims, made its first appearance in an unvaccinated nfant. The parents of the child were opposed to the principle >f vaccination. They had been successful in evading the 32 requisition of the officers appointed by the law. They had succeeded in retaining their liberty of action. But the course they had adopted culminated in the injury, and even in the death, of many of their neighbours. The man who disseminates disease among his neighbours is rightly regarded as a public enemy. Beyond his immediate surroundings outside his district, or even his county, the effect may be felt in illness and in death. Another generation may have occasion to regret his default. The consequences are not limited to time or place. No one would seriously contend that he who carelessly or wilfully exposes his neighbour to danger is undeserving of punishment, or deny that legislation which restrains such a one from his own folly, and safeguards the public from its effects, is more expedient than that which would prescribe penalties after the event. From these considerations we are bound to believe that the vaccination laws are justified both in their inception and in their operation. In exceptional instances, it is true, injury has resulted from the operation, either on account of the sickly condition of the subject or from the inoculation of disease producing material; but the exceedingly rare accidents of practice do not afford grounds for an argument adverse to the principle. Undoubtedly there is room for improvement in the details of administration. As vaccination is made compulsory in the interests of the public safety, the charges incidental to its performance should be defrayed at the public cost; but its association with the administration of Poor Law Relief, under circumstances which must be distasteful to the least sensitive of the community, is a policy which must tend to bring the operation into disrepute. Moreover, the employment at the public station of humanized lymph, an agent less efficient as a means of protection than calf lymph, is a 33 fault in administrative detail which no considerations of economy can justify. Vaccination has maintained its good repute for a period closely approaching a century. It stands, in the estimation of those the best informed upon matters relating to the prevention of disease, in a position unaffected by the lapse of time. In every country its introduction has been followed by a decline in mortality. In England, contemporaneously with its general adoption, Small Pox has almost disappeared from amongst us. It would be an attitude wanting alike in common sense and prudence, did we permit any false sentiment to interfere with the efficiency of those laws the exercise of which is doing so much in the advancement of the health and welfare of the people.

The deaths from all causes, registered in Lambeth during the year 1888, were 5157, of these 2619 were males and 2538 females. This number includes the deaths of 410 persons who had been removed to the Hospitals situated in Lambeth but who had previously lived in other parishes of the Metropolis; on the other hand 265 parishioners died in the outlying institutions in the Metropolis, and 84 parishioners died in extra Metropolitan institutions. Having deducted the former and added the latter, the number of deaths proper to Lambeth is 5096, representing a death rate of 18.1 per 1000 persons living. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 18.5 per 1000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 78,848, and the rate was the lowest on record.

Diphtheria, unrecognized in England before the year 1859, is said to have been introduced from France. Its appearance in London was immediately followed by an epidemic of considerable proportions. Since then the disease has remained amongst us, exhibiting itself in local outbreaks of greater or less severity. Year by year with few exceptions the attacks have become more numerous. Since 1877, when 316 cases were recorded, the death rate has increased fourfold. To diphtheria in London alone, during 1888, 1301 deaths are attributable. About the causal agent of diphtheria, its nature, and its origin, little is known. The weak and the robust are alike subject to attack. It affects the well fed equally with the ill fed. The crowded tenement is not more often the scene of an outbreak than the villa residence. It occurs in its greatest frequency and severity among children and during the first six years of life. But age does not confer exemption from its influence. Not unseldom when it makes an appearance in the family, several or perhaps the whole household are simultaneously attacked, a circumstance lending weight to the presumption that the disease manifest in the individual members is derived from a common origin. Milk, water, and food, have been variously suspected as the carriers of contagion, and in many well authenticated instances the suspicion has not been without foundation. That the disease is conveyed by contagion from one to another is a matter of common knowledge, and there is reason to believe the infectious material clings to the patient 58 and his clothes for weeks or even months after the disappearance of the last symptom of the malady. The question arises, is diphtheria a drain disease, or does the contagion find a congenial forcing bed in organic matter during its various stages of decomposition upon the surface ? Although circumstances would often appear to indicate the latter as a favourite seat, there is little doubt that defective drainage is contributary to the prevalence of the disease. During 1888 the invasion of 115 houses was notified at the office of the Department. A careful inspection in each case revealed the existence of defects in the condition of the drain itself or its inlets in 58 instances; but in 57 the system of drainage was in no particular defective. That the infected persons living in the houses of the latter class may also in some instances have contracted the disease from a drain source is not improbable. Children under the age of ten years comprise 77 per cent, of the sufferers. It has been noticed that children spending much of their time in the streets, and others going backward and forward to school, not infrequently find amusement in dropping stones between the bars of the gratings which guard the openings into the main sewer. Some of these openings, the ventilating shafts, as you are aware, at all times emit large volumes of sewer gas; others, consisting of the gullies at the road side, occasionally during dry seasons. In several instances it has subsequently come to the knowledge of the Inspector that the child, immediately preceding the attack, had been observed engaged in this dangerous pastime.
