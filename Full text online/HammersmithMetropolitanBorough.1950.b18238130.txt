Ex officio : The Worshipful the Mayor (Councillor F. L. Hewett, J.P.). Town Hall, Hammersmith, W.6. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Hammersmith. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,—I have pleasure in presenting my annual report for the year 1950. The report is still in an abbreviated form, on instructions from the Ministry of Health, and has been prepared on similar lines as last year. During the year Dr. Mary Irene Adams was appointed Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Fulham and relinquished her appointment as Deputy Medical Officer of Health of this Borough on the 31st December. The liaison between the Divisional staff of the London County Council and ourselves has continued on a very happy and cordial footing. There was no serious outbreak of any infectious disease during the year under review and, generally speaking, it can be said that the health of the Borough has remained satisfactory. In Hammersmith, perhaps the most interesting feature of the year and one which calls for some comment is the infant mortality rate. The present rate of 17 per 1,000 births is a record low figure and compares with 28 for the previous year. The infant mortality rate for the whole of London was 26 and for the whole of England and Wales, 29. On reference to the table in the Statistical Supplement it will be observed that the average infant death rate for the years 1906/1913 was 117. It can also be recorded that the present death rate of 10.8 per 1,000 of the population constitutes a new record low figure for the Borough. It is interesting to consider the effect of the continued fall in the loss of life amongst young and old since that time. The increase in the population of England, together with the decrease in infant deaths and also in deaths at all ages, means that our interest in the future is likely to be at least as much in the welfare of the aged as in that of the newly born. The Maternity and Child Welfare Services have been transferred to the London County Council. No local authority is permitted 2 by statute to make itself directly responsible for a similar type of welfare service for old persons. I wonder if it is too soon to throw out a hint that the direct participation of local authorities in a service to maintain our well-being, when we have finished our productive contribution to life, should be given consideration at the Ministry of Health. At the present time many local authorities are making considerable contributions to the funds of voluntary bodies which they themselves have been responsible in setting up. These voluntary bodies, perhaps, are the ghosts of the old voluntary maternity and child welfare committees which ultimately were absorbed by local authorities. It is to be hoped that the same fate awaits the fantoccini-like voluntary bodies now carrying out the welfare of old people, and that such abracadabra is not a permanent feature of the English health services. It is once more a pleasure to report that the maternal mortality rate continued to remain at a low level and only one mother lost her life because of her confinement. In conclusion, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their help and consideration shown to me and to record my thanks to the staff for their co-operation in maintaining a high standard of efficiency in the Department. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. M. DAY, Medical Officer of Health. 3 GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES. General Statistics. The Registrar General reports that in England generally and in Hammersmith there has been an increase in population. There seems to be no diminution in the tendency to overcrowd London's dormitory areas. Furthermore, a greater proportion of the population are elderly people and, of course, these are the very ones who prefer not to move to other areas but like to remain in surroundings familiar to them. No epidemic producing high mortality has occurred for some years. Vital Statistics. A reduction has taken place in the infant mortality rate (deaths of children under one year) and the rate is now 17 deaths per 1,000 births, as compared with 28 for 1949. The death rate at all ages (the general death rate) has also been reduced to a figure never before attained, and is now under 11 deaths per 1,000 of the population. Cancer, of course, is not the cause of most deaths after childhood but even so is responsible for a high proportion of the total. It is interesting that in Hammersmith during the last 10 years the cancer death rate has not altered at all and remains at the figure of just over 2 deaths per 1,000 of the total population. Infant Mortality. The number of deaths of children under one year of age was 34 during the year. Of these, the death rate amongst children born in wedlock was 17, whilst extra-marital births accounted for a rate of just over 14. This, in my view, is a particularly cogent reflection upon the services provided for the health of the mother and her child. It is usual to find that the extramarital infant mortality rate runs at a much higher level than that of legitimate children and it is particularly gratifying that the rate is now better than the legitimate rate. I make this comment, not to suggest that we want more illegitimate children, but because it is forceful reassurance that children under one year of age nowadays die of neglect less than ever before. Maternal Mortality. Only one maternal death occurred during the year. Sanitary Inspection. The work of the 17 inspectors proceeded according to schedule and a considerable amount of " catching up " was accomplished. The house to house inspection programme got well under way and during the year, under it, 852 inspections were made and 418 notices served for defects found. 4 The new allocation of the food inspection duties between Food Inspectors and District Inspectors worked smoothly and well. Broadly speaking, the two Food and Drugs Inspectors deal with all food premises except eating or drinking establishments. INCREASE OF RENT AND MORTGAGE RESTRICTIONS ACT, 1920/1939. During the year 12 applications were received for certificates under the above Act, and in 9 cases certificates were granted. This total includes three applications from owners, all of which were issued as the work specified had been completed satisfactorily. RODENT CONTROL. Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. An important change in the law took place at the end of March, when the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, was repealed and replaced by the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. Part I of this Act, which deals with rats and mice, has made fundamental changes and the primary obligation is now upon the local authority to ensure that, as far as practicable, its area is kept free from rats and mice. Under the old Act this primary duty was laid upon the individual occupier, who was liable to a penalty if he had failed to take necessary and reasonable steps to destroy rats or mice in property occupied by him or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent infestation. Henceforth, the occupier is required to notify the local authority or, in the case of food premises, the Minister of Food, in all cases where it comes to his knowledge that rats or mice are living on or resorting to his premises in substantial numbers. The Minister has undertaken to inform the particular local authority of all such notifications received. The new Act empowers the local authority to serve notices requiring the carrying out of specified treatments, structural repairs, or other works upon the owner or occupier of infested premises. This important new inclusion of owners will overcome a long-felt weakness in the law, and it should be possible in the future to secure the execution of necessary rat proofing works which it would not have been reasonable to require of an occupier. Local authorities have lost the statutory power to enter premises and deal with infestations themselves after giving 5 24 hours' notice. In general, the individual owner or occupier has the right to carry out such treatment or work as the local authority may prescribe by written notice, and the local authority can only deal with the' matter themselves if the person upon whom the notice was served defaults. An important and necessary exception is made, however, where rats and mice are present in substantial numbers in a group of separately occupied premises in a block. In such an instance, the local authority is empowered to take necessary or expedient steps to deal with the infestation themselves, after giving seven days' notice of their intention and a further 24 hours' notice before entry is made. The Act does not prevent the Council from continuing the practice of carrying out free treatment for the destruction of rats and mice in private dwelling-houses with the occupier's consent and the Minister has stated that expenditure thereby incurred will rank for grant. The main advantage of the new Act, therefore, is the power to require an owner to carry out reasonable structural repairs or other works necessary for keeping premises free from rats and mice. Under Section 2(2) of the Act every local authority shall keep such records and make such reports relating to their functions under the Act as may be required by any direction given by the Minister. No such direction was received by the end of the year and I accordingly append a summary of the work carried out during the year. Total number of complaints received :— (Rats 404—Mice 137) 541 Number of inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors 1,589 Number of Private Houses baited 395 Number of Business Premises baited 58 Number of Statutory Notices served 6 Number of Prosecutions Nil HOUSING. 851 enquiries regarding re-housing were received in the department during the year. 439 families were found upon investigation to be living in overcrowded conditions, and particulars of this overcrowding were passed to the Housing Department for transmission to the London County Council. 35 cases were recommended for re-housing on grounds of health, tuberculosis, inadequate hygienic facilities for the 6 proper care of babies and young children, and many other serious conditions. The remainder of the cases were found to be living in circumstances which were not considered sufficiently necessitous to recommend for re-housing. Although the construction of new homes by the Borough Council continued the number of families on the waiting list did not appreciably diminish. The demand for good accommodation owned or requisitioned by the Council continues to be very great and is not expected to diminish. The Council are anxious to clear areas where numbers of worn-out houses exist. There is, however, a system of rationing slum clearance which is likely to hold up any comprehensive scheme for a considerable period. I want to sound a note of warning with regard to these houses. Unless notices can be served and work can be done, whoever the owner, they will get in a worse state of disrepair, and people will continue to overcrowd them for years. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that if this happens we may return for a time to the bad old days and experience epidemic disease in such weight as has not been known this century. I urge that no discrimination be permitted and that every house in the Borough is kept in as high a state of repair as is compatible with modern ideas of housing for the people. BUILDING LICENCES. The arrangements existing for dealing with applications for building licences have continued in operation throughout the year. The Sanitary Inspectors have continued to investigate and report upon all applications received. The number of applications received during the year was 1,110. LANDLORD AND TENANT (WAR DAMAGE) (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1941. Applications for certificates of fitness for housing purposes are dealt with by the Senior Sanitary Inspector. No application was received during the year. EXHUMATION AND RE-INTERMENT OF BODIES. During the year seven Licences were granted by the Secretary of State for the exhumation and removal of bodies from graves in St. Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Harrow Road. Each of these was attended by the Sanitary Inspector for this area, and in each case it was possible to certify that the removal was carried out in a proper manner. 7 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Removal to suitable premises of persons in need of care and attention. Section 47 of the above Act provides that a Local Authority shall be responsible for the removal to suitable premises of persons who are suffering from a grave chronic disease or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, who are living in insanitary conditions and who are unable to devote to themselves and are not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. It has been found necessary on two occasions to apply to the Court for Orders under this section during the year. Enquiry and consideration into both cases showed that, in their interest and for preventing injury to the health of others, they should be removed from the premises in which they were residing. In one case an Order was obtained from the West London Magistrates' Court for the patient's removal to and detention in an Institution for a period of three months. It was not necessary to apply for an extension as the patient died within this period. In the other case, an Order was obtained from the West London Magistrates' Court for the patient's removal to and detention in Hospital for a period of three months, which was extended for a further period of three months. Fifty-seven other cases, all elderly persons, alleged to be living without proper care and attention, were reported, but in no case was it found necessary to take legal action to enforce removal to hospital. It was possible, however, to arrange the voluntary admission of seven cases to Hospital and four cases to an Institution. Eight cases were referred to the duly Authorised Officer of the London County Council. Burial or cremation of the dead. It is provided that the Local Authority shall arrange burial or cremation in the case of any person who has died or been found dead in the Borough, in any case where it appears to the authority that no suitable funeral arrangements have been or are being made. The Council may recover from the estate of the deceased person or from any person who for the purposes of this Act was liable to maintain the deceased person immediately before his death, expenses incurred for the burial or cremation. 8 Up to the end of the year eighteen burials have been carried out in Hammersmith at a total cost of £186 16s. Of this amount £79 18s. 5d. has been recovered. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. Meat and other Foods. Routine inspections of shops, stalls, vehicles and premises where food and drink intended for human consumption is sold, stored and prepared have been made throughout the Borough during the year. The number of inspections of food premises made during 1950 totalled 3,673. Four seizures of unsound food were made under Section 10 of the Act. The commodities involved were dried milk, bread and dates, and in each case they were taken before a magistrate who ordered the destruction of the foodstuffs as being unfit for human consumption. Quant ities of unsound food were also voluntarily surrendered during the year (see list in Statistical Supplement). Sampling. As the result of the appointment of a second Food and Drugs Inspector in the spring of this year, there has been a large increase in the number of samples taken for chemical analysis. During the year 1,413 samples of food and drugs were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst under the provisions of the above Act. Only six samples (or .4 per cent.) were reported adulterated. It is of interest to mention that for the first time samples of fish and fruit have been taken for the purpose of identification. All the specimens sampled have been confirmed as properly advertised at the time of sale. In the case of fish, certificates were obtained from the Public Analyst in verification, and each sample of fruit was submitted for examination to the Royal Horticultural Society. Ice Cream. Nineteen premises were registered during the year. At the end of 1950 the total number of registrations in compliance with Section 14 of the Act were 244. The Food and Drugs Inspectors made 342 visits to premises where ice-cream is sold, stored or manufactured. Since 1949 samples of ice-cream taken for bacteriological examination have been submitted for testing to the Public Health Laboratory Service, Colindale. Prior to this, bacteriological examinations were carried out in the Borough at the West London Hospital. 9 During the year 37 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and 17 for chemical analysis. Synthetic Creams. There has been a noticeable increase in the production of confectionery in which synthetic, etc., creams are used; this may be a result of the restrictions on the sale of sweets. Particular attention has been paid to the sampling of synthetic and butter creams, and during the year 106 samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Samples of cream were taken during manufacture and of the final products, e.g. cream buns, gateaux, layer cakes, etc., exposed for sale by retail, and also from bulk supplies. In the case of one manufacturer it was reported that butter cream was heavily contaminated with coliform bacilli of faecal origin, and upon investigation the likely cause appeared to be due to a number of factors. It was found that the cream after manufacture was kept in a warm atmosphere suitable for the growth of organisms, there was a general lack of coverings to receptacles containing the cream, sufficient care was not being taken by employees in the washing of hands, and the method of cleansing receptacles was unsatisfactory. The precautionary measures required were pointed out to the management, and steps were at once taken by them to implement all the recommendations, one of which was that a specially enclosed " cream room" should be built. The manufacture of the cream was transferred to other staff and structural alterations carried out to the premises, including the construction of a separate room for the manufacture of butter cream. Results of these measures at once became obvious, and all the varieties of cakes involved began to be reported free from faecal contamination. Initially the improvement was perhaps only about 10 per cent, of all samples taken ; gradually, however, this percentage increased until finally all samples were reported to be satisfactory. This happy state of affairs continues (April, 1951). Milk. Eighteen samples of milk were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis and 103 samples of Special Designated Milk (Tuberculin Tested, Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised, Pasteurised, Sterilised), were submitted for the methylene blue, phosphatase and turbidity tests, all of which were reported to comply with the required standards. 10 At one of the large milk processing and bottling depots in the Borough, extensive alterations are in progress involving almost complete re-equipment with modern plant. It has been shown over the past number of years that the results of milk testing as laid down in the Sale of Milk Regulations 1939 has proved to be very satisfactory, and, in view of this, the number of samples taken for examination during 1950 was reduced, allowing the Food and Drugs Inspectors to increase the amount of sampling of other commodities. Inspection and Supervision of Food and Food Premises, etc. It has been observed that offences relating to food which in the past consisted mainly of the addition or abstraction of some substance for the purpose of gain, appear to be giving place to offences arising from carelessness in preparation or manufacture and lack of supervision. Among these, the most common is perhaps the presence of foreign bodies in foodstuffs such as string in bread and fly pupae in milk bottles. The following is a list of some of the complaints of this nature received in the department. Human hair in dried milk. Wood in bread. Iron locking nut in bread. String in bread. Dirt containing fibres and insect fragments in a bread roll. Wood in butter. 2-in. nail in a currant pudding. Piece of cloth in tinned corned beef. Fly pupae in bottle of milk. Glass fragments in bottle of milk. Metal foil caps in bottle of milk. Deposits of foreign matter (cement, etc.) in bottles of milk. Legal proceedings were taken in a number of these cases resulting in a total of £72 4s. in penalties and costs. Underground Bakehouses. As the result of action taken under Section 54 of the Factories Act, 1937, the number of basement bakehouses in use in the Borough has been reduced to four. In these cases Certificates of Suitability as required by the Act have been renewed following completion of the necessary work to the satisfaction of the Council. 11 Slaughterhouses. In accordance with the Livestock (Restriction on Slaughtering) Order 1940, no slaughtering was carried out in the Borough during the year but two licences have been renewed by the occupiers. Licensed Premises. An investigation of the conditions relating to the washing of glasses in public houses was undertaken. In all, 103 premises were visited. Particular attention was given to the number and type of sinks in which the glasses were washed, the availability or otherwise of an adequate supply of water (hot and cold), the use of detergents in the cleaning process and the condition of cloths used for drying and polishing. The actual method of washing glasses differs in the several houses and also with the state of business. The general practice, however, is to wash the glasses in a sink containing hot water, allow them to drain on a draining board (usually of metal) and then to polish them with a cloth. When the trade is brisk the polishing process may not be carried out. In a few of the houses the glasses are rinsed as a separate operation after they have been washed, and then drained and polished. In a number of the houses all glasses are thoroughly cleansed with a hand brush as a routine (sometimes daily, sometimes twice a week) in addition to the washing after use, and at seven of the premises, a glass washing machine has been installed. It was found that the practice adopted for washing glasses in public houses throughout the Borough was generally good; in 94 of the 103 premises visited, a constant supply of both hot and cold water has been installed over a sink or sinks in the bars ; in 58 houses a detergent is added to the washing-up water ; the cloths used for washing and polishing the glasses were found to be clean. Markets. There are in the Borough three street markets, Bradmore Market in Bradmore Lane, Norland Market in Norland Road and Shepherds Bush Market in Railway Approach leading from Goldhawk Road to Uxbridge Road. The last named is on private property but the first two are in thoroughfares which have been designated by the Borough Council as streets in which licenced street traders may operate pursuant to the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1947. At the present time there are 103 stalls and premises dealing in food commodities and 39 licences have been issued to street traders trading in food, these being the stallholders in the markets controlled by the Council. 12 The food stalls and premises in the three markets are summarised in their various trades as under :— Grocers and Provision Merchants 14 Butchers 6 Dealers in Horseflesh for Human Consumption 2 Greengrocers 47 Fishmongers 7 Dealers in Rabbits 3 Sweets and Confectioners 6 Chemists and Drug Stores 3 Cafes, Snack Bars and Coffee Stalls 9 Ices and Minerals 4 Bakers and Confectioners 2 Refuse is removed daily from the private market by a contractor. In the case of the two street markets, controlled by the Council, the Borough Engineer is responsible for the cleansing of the thoroughfares. Waste materials and refuse from the stalls is removed several times a day. At all the shop premises concerned, adequate water closet accommodation and washing facilities are provided. In the case of the stallholders, water is obtained from neighbouring premises, storage premises and stand pipes; water closet accommodation is available at nearby public conveniences. The Council commenced during the year preparatory moves to provide full washing facilities in these conveniences, incorporating hot air hand dryers. Pharmacy and Poisons. The names and addresses of 107 retailers were entered on the Council's list of persons entitled to sell poisons under Part 2 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. No action was necessary in respect of any offence under the Act. These premises have been inspected as to their suitability, method of storage and labelling, as required under the Act. BACTERIOLOGICAL SERVICES. As previously referred to the Food and Drugs part of the Council's bacteriological examinations are dealt with at the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. The Borough Council have arranged, for the convenience of local doctors and their patients, that various bacteriological investigations are made at the West London Hospital. This service ensures that there is no difficulty in getting the specimens to the laboratory. The system has been in use for some years and has been found to be thoroughly successful. 13 FOOD POISONING. Total Nnmber of outbreaks. Number of cases. Number of deaths. Organisms or other agents responsible with number of outbreaks of each. Foods involved with number of outbreaks of each. 3 First outbreak—4 Nil. Staphylococcus Aureus. Cold cooked pork. Second outbreak—3 (all in one family). Nil. Not isolated. Not known. Third outbreak—2 (all in one family). Nil. Not isolated. Not known. In addition to the above, eight cases were notified from various addresses in the Borough. There were no deaths. In two of the cases Bacillus Aertrycke was isolated as the responsible organism. Organisms were not isolated in the remaining six cases. Foods involved included a leg of lamb, roast beef and meat pies, but it was not possible to isolate any organism from any of these foods. HAMMERSMITH CLEAN FOOD TRADERS' GUILD. The Hammersmith Clean Food Traders' Guild, the formation of which I referred to at some length in my last report, has continued to make progress. Further applications for membership were received during the year under review from both traders and employees. A number of premises of traders who had applied for membership when the Guild was inaugurated, but at which certain works were required by the Health Department before they could be regarded as satisfactory, were brought into conformity with the Guild's Codes of Practice and enrolled. The membership at the end of the year totalled over 100. One aspect of the Guild's work, which I consider of great value, was developed during the year. Arrangements were made for talks on " Food Hygiene " to be given to employees in the food trades. The talks are illustrated by film strips shown by a portable diascope and screen at the trader's own premises. They are given to audiences either large or small and in rooms of any size. The only requirement is an electric supply to illuminate the diascope. A number of talks along similar lines have been given also to various organisations such as Women's Guilds, Trade Union Branch Meetings, Church gatherings, etc. These talks have been well received and, I think, have served a useful purpose. 14 CORONER'S COURT AND PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year new refrigerating equipment was installed and the Mortuary was closed for a short time whilst this work was in progress. Consequently there was a slight reduction in the total amount of work done. The Mortuary is in use by the Boroughs of Chelsea, Fulham and Hammersmith ; in addition the Coroner's Court was used for inquests on persons dying in the Royal Borough of Kensington. TUBERCULOSIS. The number of new cases has fallen to the 1948 total and in general the incidence of the disease has not varied very much during that period. The sum total of the two factors, of course, means that there are more cases in the Borough and there has been a steady rise since the immediate post-war period, when the total was 859 as opposed to the present figure of 1,779. This means that whilst the outlook to the individual sufferer is improved, the risk to the healthy person is increased, and so it is more important than ever that special attention should be paid to the environment of every case to ensure the greatest possible degree of preventive attention. MASS RADIOGRAPHY. Arrangements were again made for a Mass Radiography Campaign in the Borough during the year in conjunction with the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospitals Board. The scheme enables large groups of persons to have their chests X-rayed, the object being, of course, to detect anything abnormal and, in particular, to discover cases of early Tuberculosis. The Unit was established at Olympia for five days during the month of August for the purpose of conducting the X-ray examinations. A number of industrial undertakings in the Borough were invited to allow their employees to undergo examination by the Unit and certain sessions were reserved for examination of the general public. The scheme was advertised to the public in the local press, by means of posters and handbills and slides were shown at four of the largest cinemas in the Borough. 15 Disposal of large film cases. (a) No further action 44 (b) To return to Unit for further X-ray 14 (c) Further investigation required (not necessarily Tuberculosis) 31 (d) Known cases had or having treatment 1 (e) Failed to return for large film 4 MEDICINAL BATHS. In war and peace there is a great difference in the amount of scabies and other verminous conditions in the warring or peaceful countries. After more than five years of peace in London our Medicinal Baths are dealing with fewer and fewer qases of infestation, both amongst children and amongst adults. This fluctuation, however, does not apply to the same extent to the incidence of the bed bug and the flea, and it has been possible to give greater attention to homes so affected. All this work is done without charge. STATISTICAL SUPPLEMENT TO ANNUAL REPORT FOR YEAR 1950 2 GENERAL STATISTICS—1950.
