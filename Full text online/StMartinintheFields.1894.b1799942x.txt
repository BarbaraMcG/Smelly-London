STMART 2 Vestry of St. martin-in-the-Fields. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1894. LONDON: HARRISON AND SONS, ST. MARTIN'S LANE, Printers in Ordinary to Her Majesty. 1895. MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT, 1 8 94. Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, for the Year 1894. To the Vestry of St, Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Twentyfifth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. During the year the registered Births numbered 233, being an increase of 10 over the previous year. 2 The following Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 15 15 30 February 11 3 14 March 6 8 14 April 10 7 17 May 11 11 22 June 9 11 20 July 7 7 14 August 12 10 22 September 11 11 22 October 10 13 23 November 13 7 20 December 9 6 15 124 109 233 The Birth-rate of the Parish for the year 1894 is 16.0 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths. The total Deaths registered in St. Martin-in-the-Fields during the year 1894 numbered 341, being a decrease of 26 over the previous year. 3 The following Table gives the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year 1894:— Males. Females. Total January 24 16 40 February 19 10 29 March 22 12 34 April 15 12 27 May 18 10 28 June 14 14 28 July 13 14 27 August 12 13 25 September 13 5 18 October 23 12 35 November 16 11 27 December 18 5 23 207 134 341 These 341 Deaths include those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, and therefore must be omitted in estimating the death-rate, but, on the other hand, the deaths occurring outside the Parish among persons belonging thereto must be added. On referring to Table 7, it will at once make clear what I have just stated. In estimating the Death-rate, I do so in two forms, the first in which are excluded 21 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in Edmonton Workhouse and 2 at St. Martin's Almshouses, they having been resident in these Institutions many years prior to their death, and in the second I have included them. Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1894, excluding 21 deaths of aged parishioners occurring in the Edmonton Workhouse and 2 in the St. Martin's Almshouse 16.0 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 4 Death-rate of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the year 1894, including the 21 deaths of aged persons occurring in Edmonton Workhouse and 2 in St. Martin's Almshouses 17.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population. Infantile Mortality. The mortality of children under one year of age in the year 1894 was at the rate of 206.0 per 1,000 births. Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 years of age, in and out of the Parish, during the year 1894, numbered 73. 38 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 22 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 10 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ 3 „ „ 90 „ 100 „ Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.—The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhœa. The total number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the above class of disease was 27. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin-inthe-Fields would be 26. Small-Pox.—Notwithstanding the prevalence of this disease in some parts of London, this Parish, during the year, was quite free from the complaint. 5 Measles.—In the early months of the year, this malady produced 8 deaths, and 1 of a parishioner in King's College Hospital. Scarlet Fever.—No death from this disease occurred in the Parish, but 1 of a parishioner was recorded at the Western Fever Hospital, Seagrave Road, Fulham. The number of cases notified during the year in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was only 21, against 100 of the previous year, 1893. Diphtheria.—The total deaths in the Parish from this malady were 8, and of this number 4 were those of non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital; and in addition, 1 of a parishioner, occurred in King's College Hospital, making in all 5 to the credit of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Whooping Cough.—Four deaths were attributable to this disease, and 1 of a parishioner in King's College Hospital. Typhoid Fever.—Four deaths were due to this complaint, 2 of which were non-parishioners, occurring in the Charing Cross Hospital. Typhus Fever.—No death was recorded from this malady. Puerperal Fever.—One death of a parishioner occurred from this disease in Wandsworth Workhouse. Choleka.—Nil. Diarrhœa.—Three deaths from Diarrhoea were recorded, 1 of which was an infant, a non-parishioner, and occurred in a railway carriage, and, in addition, a young child belonging to the Parish, died in a Hospital outside. The deaths from all causes, with the ages at death of those who died in the Parish, and also of those parishioners who died in institutions outside the district will be found fully detailed in Tables 2 and 6. 6 Inquests. During the year 1894 there were held 58 inquests. The causes which produced death were as follows:— Natural causes 25 Pistol Shot Wound (suicide) 3 ,, ,, „ (murder) 1 4 Drowning 4 Hanging (suicide) 1 Poison, carbolic acid (suicide) 2 „ morphine (suicide) 1 ,, chloroform 1 4 Erysipelas following a blow 1 Burns 3 Cause not specified 1 Suffocation 1 Found dead—newly-bom child 1 Injuries received in a goods lift 1 „ „ from fall from a scaffold 1 „ „ „ „ wall 1 „ „ ,, jumping off roof of a house (suicide) 1 Injuries received from jumping from a window (suicide) 1 Injuries received from falling down 3 „ „ „ a fall from Waterloo Bridge 1 Injuries received from falling downstairs 1 ,, „ „ a cellar flap 1 ,, „ „ being run over by a train (suicide) 1 Injuries received from a fall from a van 1 58 Notification of Infectious Disease. The number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year was much below that of the previous year, 1893, when they 7 numbered 151, and in the year 1894 the figures were 71. On referring to Table 9 the comparison of these two years can be seen at a glance. The fee paid to the Medical Practitioners for certifying to these cases amounted to £6 19s. 6d., which sum is repaid to the Vestry by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The provision of telephonic communication at the Town Hall directly with the offices of the Metropolitan Asylums Board has greatly facilitated the prompt removal of infectious cases. Disinfection after Infectious Disease. During the year 40 disinfections were carried out. These, as for several years past, were performed by Mr. W. G. Lacy, who has extensive disinfecting premises at St. John's Wharf, Town Mead Road, Fulham. The disinfections were all carried out with the utmost dispatch and care. The House to House Inspection. The works ordered in conformity with this inspection are in a great many cases still unfinished. There have been many unforeseen circumstances preventing their completion, legal difficulties and the new system of sewerage in the Adelphi area, which has given your Surveyor a great amount of anxiety and trouble, but I am glad to say the works are beginning to near the end. I must remind you that the owners of all the houses abutting on these new sewers will have to make connections of their drains with this new system of sewerage. This of course entails a large amount of supervision on the part of your officers. For the last twelve months we have had only one Sanitary Inspector, instead of three, to carry on this work; his time, it is needless to say, is fully occupied in performing his duties. Then, again, a large number of new houses are springing up in the Parish, and in which the sanitary arrangements are required to meet the Bye-Laws of the London County Council, also the Regulations for House Drainage drawn up by your Surveyor. In houses in course of erection, these bye-laws and regulations should be rigidly 8 enforced, but on the other hand, houses at present standing, leniency and discretion should be shown in any alterations required in their sanitary arrangements; for these houses having been built many years ago, it is a difficult matter to apply to them modern sanitary arrangements. Some of the works completed have taken a long time to carry out. Exeter Hall and the Hotel Victoria, for instance, took months, and I could enumerate many more, such as large business houses. In concluding these remarks on this subject, I must bear testimony to the intilligence and zeal in which your Inspector, Mr. G. A. Allan, is displaying in the discharge of his duties; he is doing the work in a manner so as to produce as little friction as possible, and I think I may safely say he has been so far successful. Appended is a list of those premises where notices and plans have been sent in of intention to lay down new drains since the commencement of this inspection up to the end of February, 1895.

In all, 48 samples have been taken during the year for the purpose of analysis, and in all cases except 4 the samples were certified to be genuine. The excepted cases were adulterated to a small extent, not sufficient to warrant a prosecution; the vendors were cautioned. The samples were as follows:— Coffee 6 samples. Genuine. Tea 3 „ „ Cocoa 3 „ ,, Sugar 6 „ „ Butter 9 „ „ New Milk 9 „ 2 of the samples were poor, the rest genuine. Tinned Milk 3 „ Genuine. Bread 3 ,, „ Whisky 6 „ 2 of the samples were a little below the standard, the rest genuine. 11 Bake-Houses. The bake-houses have been duly inspected, and have been found in a clean and satisfactory condition. On the 15th October, 1894, at the requisition of the Vestry of St. George the Martyr, Southwark, a conference of the Vestries and District Boards was held at the Vestry Hall, Borough Road, as to the amendment of the law regulating bake-houses. Mr. J. U. Turner, a member of this Vestry, and myself attended this conference. After a very lengthy discussion the following resolutions were adopted:— 1. That the present state of the law relating to bake-houses requires amendment by the addition of the following clauses to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. (a) That uniform Metropolitan Bye-laws, regulating houses be made by the London County Council, and be confirmed by the Local Government Board, and that the duty of enforcing these Bye-laws shall devolve upon the various Local Sanitary Authorities. (b) That the portion of the Bye-laws regulating the structure of bake-houses do not apply to existing bakeries. (c) That the London County Council be empowered to frame Bye-laws for the construction of underground bakehouses, and that all bake-houses erected after the passing of such Bye-laws shall conform thereto. These resolutions are, in my opinion, just and fair. They do not affect, as regards structure, present bake-houses, and if they did so, it would, I think, be very hard to put the owners to an outlay, which would be very great, in reconstructing their bakeries. The above resolutions, as regards construction, would only apply to those bake-houses erected after the passing of such Bye-laws. Sanitary Notices. Legal Sanitary Notices, to the number of 205, were served upon the owners or occupiers of property; and, in addition, a great number of friendly notices were also served. 12 Magisterial proceedings were instituted in three cases against owners or occupiers who failed to comply with the notices. I think you will find it absolutely necessary to retain the services of the present temporary Sanitary Inspector as a permanent officer. So much attention is now being directed to sanitation that the work in this department has enormously increased, and, notwithstanding this increase of work, we have only one permanent Inspector, as when I was appointed, 25 years ago, your Medical Officer of Health. Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Sanitary Inspector, whom you appointed permanently to inspect these houses, has regularly carried out this duty, and has reported to me all sanitary defects coming under his notice. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Graven Street, February, 1895. 13 TABLE I.
