AC4391 ACT 56 ACTION BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1953 BOROUGH OF ACTON ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE REPORT ON THE MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS FOR THE YEAR 1953 2 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1953 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Acton, W.3. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Acton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I submit the Annual Report of the health of the Borough of Acton for the year 1953. Statistics are always of interest and I should like to draw attention to some of the figures in the report. The infantile mortality rate of children under one year is 25.7 per 1,000 live births; this is not so good as in 1952 when the figure was 18.6 per 1,000 live births. The chief cause of death in children under one year was congenital defects and prematurity, and I am afraid that we do not yet know how to attack these problems. The corrected birth rate was 12.03 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 13.21 in 1952. The births outnumber deaths in 1953, and wherever this is the situation, it is clear that the population of this area is growing. There were two deaths of children under two years of age due to gastro-enteritis, and these occurred during the summer months, although the year was notably deficient in hot weather. Included in the body of the report is a brief summary of statistics over the last ten years. Two important deductions can be made from this table. The first is that the maternal mortality rate is very low; there have been no maternal deaths during this period except in 1945, and this tends to show that care and skill devoted to the birth of children in the district either at home or in hospital are 3 first class. The second observation is that the infant mortality rate has been reduced since 1944 from 44.8 to 25.7 deaths per 1,000 infants born—almost a 50% reduction. During the year we have noticed much publicity in the daily press concerning cancer of the lung. In the year 1952 there were 28 deaths from cancer of the lung or bronchus and in 1953 there were 23 deaths. The following table shows the site of the affection.

Our campaign to immunise the child population is being continued with vigour. As over many years past the problem of old persons living on their own still gives rise to difficulties, but with the co-operation of the Geriatric Clinic, various Hospitals in the neighbourhood and the County Council's Welfare Officer, most of the cases have been settled without resort to legal process, either by admission to hospitals or institutions or by the continuance of care by the old persons' friends or relations. Unfortunately, however, legal compulsion became necessary in two cases during the year, when orders under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. were obtained for the removal of two old people to an institution. I should like to take this opportunity of expressing to the staff of the Public Health Department my appreciation of their cooperation and loyalty throughout the year. I remain, Your obedient servant, George E. B. Payne. 4 LIST OF CONTENTS Introduction 2 List of Staff 5 Section A.—Statistics and Social Conditions 6 Section B.—General Provision of Health Services in the Area 13 Section C.—Health Services Provided by Middlesex County Council 16 Section D.—Infectious and other Diseases, Scabies and other Conditions 22 Section E.—Housing 29 Section F Sanitary Circumstances of the Area 30 Section G.—Inspection and Supervision of Food 36 Section H.—Diseases of Animals 44 Section J.—Atmospheric Pollution 45 Annual Report of the School Medical Officer 49 5 STAFF Medical Officer of Health George E.

Consequently it is not strictly possible to compare the birth and death rates for Acton with those for England and Wales. 13 SECTION B GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA LABORATORY FACILITIES These continue as in previous years. The Ministry of Health Emergency Medical Service provides a Pathological Service at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Laboratory at Ealing. The following Table gives the types, and number, of specimens submitted for examination. [##3]Type No. of specimens examined Throat and Nose Swabs 164 Ear Swabs 3 Sputum 1 Faeces 241 Hair, Widals, etc. 9 Milk 62 Milk Bottles 30 Water 54 Ice-Cream 157 HOSPITAL PROVISION The Regional Hospital Board of the N.W. Metropolitan Area, which includes Acton, is responsible for hospital treatment of the sick. The most difficult cases for which to obtain treatment are 14 old persons or chronic sick who become acutely ill or who are in the terminal stage of their illness. These types of cases need continuous care and treatment, and it is just these requirements which cannot be met in the home. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948 Under Section 47 of this Act power is given to the Councils of County Boroughs and County Districts to apply to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction for an Order for removal and detention, in a suitable hospital or other place, of persons who (a) are suffering from grave chronic disease, or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions; and (b) are unable to devote to themselves, and are not re- ceiving from other persons, proper care and attention. Several cases were brought to our notice during the year and in most of these it was possible by co-operating with the local hospital to arrange for the persons concerned to be admitted. However, in two cases it was found necessary to take action under Section 47. The first of these cases concerned a man aged 82. When I visited following a complaint I found that his clothing and bedding were dirty and foul smelling. His rooms were dirty and the kitchen appeared not to have been used for cooking for some time. He was physically weak and nobody was looking after him. He could not be persuaded to enter a suitable home and as his condition did not improve I decided that it would be in the man's interests if he were removed to an institution. The other case was that of a woman over 80 years of age, and the circumstances were similar. Orders were obtained authorising their detention for three months, and, in the case of the man, this period was extended as his physical condition did not improve. The woman became a voluntary patient and both were still in an institution at the endi of the year. 15 The Borough of Acton carried out its obligations under Section 50 of this Act (i.e. the burial of bodies for which no other provision was made). MASS X-RAY The N.W.Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board MassX-ray Unit visited Acton from 10th March to 15th April, 1953, and individual visits were made to several of the larger factories later in the year. Most of the period was given to group appointments from factories and other establishments, and the response was good. Sessions were also arranged for the general public, but these were not so well attended as had been hoped. A total of 18,229 persons attended and of these 1,271 were members of the general public. For the first time invitations were issued under the Unit's scheme for X-raying Middlesex school leavers. Approximately 650 children who had left school at Christmas 1952 in the boroughs of Acton, Brentford & Chiswick and Ealing were sent appointments, and about 40% attended. A further 173 were X-rayed in September. I am indebted to the Physician in Charge of the Mass X-ray Unit for the following particulars of persons who attended for examination. The statistics given do not necessarily relate only to persons residing in Acton, as the facilities were available to all, whether they resided in the Borough or not. Males Females Total Number of persons examined 11,822 6,407 18,229 Recalled for large films 208 74 282 Disposal of large film cases: (a) No further action 193 (b) To return to Unit for further X-ray 1 (c) Further investigation required (this does not necessarily indicate tuberculosis) 71 (d) Known cases had or having treatment 5 (e) Failed to return for large films 12 16 SECTION C HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY MIDDLESEX COUNTY COUNCIL AMBULANCE FACILITIES The Middlesex County Council is responsible for this service. NURSING IN THE HOME This service is administered locally by the Middlesex County Council. The number of sick persons under care in Acton during the year was 1,823 necessitating 28,968 visits. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE 1953 saw the opening of the new Pierrepoint Road Clinic in premises acquired by the County Council at the juncture of Creswick and Pierrepoint Roads, in the district formerly known as Springfield Park. The house, "Manorlea", stands in grounds of approximately seven-eighths of an acre, and its value as a suitable site for ultimate development as a health centre was a potent factor in the compulsory purchase of the property by the Middlesex County Council. A restricted adaptation of the premises was carried out to provide for Child Welfare and Ante Natal Clinics, but it was not considered expedient to equip yet another dental surgery. It was anticipated that it might be possible to transfer one of the Ante Natal Relaxation classes from Avenue Road to Pierrepoint Road, but up to: the end of the year this was not found practicable, owing to: difficulty in recruiting Health Visiting staff. The new clinic soon became popular with the mothers, and' sessions were diverted there from Cloister Road and Avenue Road Clinics. Its situation also permitted ready access for mothers living in the Ealing Common area, just across the western border oft Acton, and by arrangement with Dr. Booth, the Joint Area: Medical Officer, the district of one Health Visitor was extended toi take in the roads stretching from the borough boundary to Hanger< Lane. 17 At the close of the year weekly sessions were being held as follows: — CHILD WELFARE Avenue Road Three sessions weekly, two with and one without a doctor. Cloister Road Two sessions weekly, one with and one without a doctor. Palmerston Road Two sessions weekly, one with and one without a doctor. Pierrepoint Road Three sessions, two with and one without a doctor. Steele Road Two sessions, one with and one out a doctor. Trinity Way Two sessions, both with a doctor. ANTE-NATAL Avenue Road One session weekly. Cloister Road One session a fortnight. Palmerston Road One session weekly. Pierrepoint Road One session a fortnight. Trinity Way One session a fortnight. ANTE NATAL EXERCISES Avenue Road Two sessions weekly. The average attendances per session for the six Child Welfare Clinics are given below, last year's figures being shown in brackets. Avenue Road 3 sessions weekly 24.2 (22.8) Trinity Way 2 sessions weekly 37.7 (33.7) Cloister Road 2 sessions weekly 28 (29.0) Palmerston Road 2 sessions weekly 28.7 (30.8) Steele Road 2 sessions weekly 27.5 (28.4) Pierrepoint Road 3 sessions weekly 34.9 CHILD WELFARE CLINICS Total number of children who first attended the clinics during the year, and who, on the date of their first attendance were: Under one year of age 899 Between the ages of one and five 72 18 Total number of children who attended during the year, and who, , at the end of the year were: — Under one year of age 798 Over one year 2,275 Total number of attendances at Centres during the year: By children under one year of age 14,197 By children between one and five years 6,499 HEALTH VISITING Number of visits during the year by all Health Visitors working in this area: — To expectant mothers—First visits 306 Total visits 406 To children under one year of age—First visits 922 Total visits 2,896 To children between the age of one and five years—Total visits 3,922 MIDWIFERY SERVICE Domiciliary Midwifery was performed as in previous years by the Midwives of Queen Charlotte's Hospital. Only 16% of the total births were home confinements. The bulk of the hospital confinements were accepted at Central Middlesex, Queen Charlotte's and Hammersmith Hospitals, the table below gives the distribution: — Central Middlesex Hospital 34.6% Queen Charlotte's Hospital 32.0% Hammersmith Hospital 8.2% Other Hospitals 7.7% Nursing Homes 1.5% Confined at home (Queen Charlotte's midwives attending) 16% ANTE-NATAL CLINIC The opening of the new Pierrepoint Road Clinic provided a convenient central focus for the transfer of one of the Ante Natala 19 Clinics from Avenue Road. Some mothers who would formerly have attended at Cloister Road, also found that Pierrepoint Road was more centrally situated, so that by the autumn the weekly timetable was as follows: Avenue Road Wednesday afternoon Cloister Road Alternate Friday mornings Palmerston Road Wednesday morning Pierrepoint Road Alternate Thursday mornings Trinity Way Alternate Thursday mornings The following table shows the number of attendances made throughout the year: Number of new cases attending during the year 621 Total number who attended during year 839 Total number of attendances made 2,897 Average number who attended per session 14.2 POST NATAL CLINICS There were no specific post natal clinics as the majority of patients returned to hospital for this examination. The domisiliary cases who had been attended by Queen Charlotte's Midwives also attended the post natal clinic at the hospital. Two women only, attended the local ante natal clinic for their post natal examination. EXERCISE CLASS FOR MOTHERS Attendance at these "relaxation classes" continued to improve. 78 new patients were taken on during the year and there was a total of 752 attendances, an average of eight per session. PREMATURE INFANTS Certain changes in the compilation of statistics for the Ministry of Health Annual Return Form L.H.S.27 have enabled us this year to give a more complete record of the occurrence of premature births and the survival of premature infants. Hitherto it has been the practice for hospitals to supply statistical information to the Ministry regarding all premature births occurring in hospital together with information in respect of the infants' survival, It was 20 left to the Local Health Authority to collect this information only in respect of home births and births in private nursing homes. In January 1953, the Ministry issued a draft of Form L.H.S.27 by which the Local Health Authority was made responsible for the collection and transmission of information in respect of all premature infants born to women resident in its area. The following is a condensed version of the table supplied in respect of premature births in Acton. Number of Premature Live Births (a) In Hospital 51 (b) At Home 2 (c) In Private Nursing Homes 2 55 Number of Premature Stillbirths (a) In Hospital 5 (b) At Home 1 (c) In Private Nursing Homes — 6 Live Premature Births TOTAL Died within 34 hrs. Died between 1st day and. 28th day Survivin, at end of 28 days Born in Hospital 51 3 4 44 Born at Home 2 — — 2 Born in Nursing Home 2 — — 2 BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC As in previous years, arrangements for this purpose with the North Kensington Women's Welfare Association were continued.: One clinic weekly was held at the Palmerston Road Hall, Southt Aoton, a nominal fee being paid to the County Council for the use of the premises. One new patient was referred for advice in 1953. 21 HOME HELP SCHEME At the end of the year there were 5 full-time Home Helps, and 59 part-time Staff. The following table shows the number of cases actually attended: — Number of cases attended Maternity 46 Tuberculosis 31 Chronic Sick 274 Other cases attended 62 DAY NURSERIES The report of 1952 made reference to the six-monthly review which was to take place in 1953. At this review, which was undertaken in June, a revised interpretation of expenditure factors was adopted and this gave more stringent effect to the new scale of charges imposed in 1952. Notwithstanding this, radical changes were introduced in November by the County Council's decision that the existing arrangements should be superseded by the general assessment scale in force for other services under County control, and, since the Divisional Finance Officers were responsible for assessments for all these services, it was decided to give them the responsibility for assessing Day Nursery charges also. At about the same time the County Council's decision on the question of closure of certain Day Nurseries was also made known. ; Acton was to lose Horn Lane Nursery (the largest remaining since the closure of Birkbeck Road at the end of the war), but was to be allowed to retain St. Dunstan's at East Acton, Bollo Bridge Road in South Acton, and "Longcot" in Bedford Park. The date of closure was fixed for Friday the 1st January, 1954, when it was anticipated that the bulk of Horn Lane children would be accommo; dated at St. Dunstan's and the remainder offered places at Bollo Bridge and "Longcot".

(2) A notice was sent to the parent of each 8 months old child. (3) All children admitted to Day Nurseries were given protection. (4) Health Visitors combed their districts for children who did not attend Welfare Centres, and urged their protection. (5) Head Teachers gave forms of consent to new school entrants. (6) Prior to school medical inspections, questionnaires were sent to each parent asking, inter alia, whether the child had been inoculated. If the answer was in the negative a form of consent was sent to the parent. All immunised cases were followed up and, at the end of three years, each child was offered a boost dose. At the age of 11 years or over, this was preceded by a Schick test. All children under 5 who had not had the disease, were inoculated against Whooping Cough at the same time as they were inoculated against Diphtheria, i.e. they had three doses of protective material at monthly intervals. Owing to the fact that estimates of child population are no longer supplied by the Registrar General, it is not possible to give 23 the proportion of children immunised against Diphtheria, but the actual number at 31st December, is as follows: Children under 5 years of age 2,853 Children 5 to 15 years of age 8,293 The figures of work carried out during 1953 are given below: DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION, 1953 Total number of under 5s inoculated 696 Total number of over 5s inoculated 53 Boost dose after 3 years 1,098 Schick Test after 3 years—Negative 270 Positive 5 Primary Schick Test —Negative 44 Positive 13 24 CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE NOTIFIED DURING THE YEAR (Corrected).

Of the total notifications 546 were in respect of measles and 182 in respect of whooping cough. Poliomyelitis During the year 5 cases of poliomyelitis were notified, 4 of which were paralytic. One death was attributed to polioencephalitis after a post mortem examination on a girl aged 6 years, who had been found dead in bed. This case was not notified. Food Poisoning Food Poisoning Notifications (Corrected) Returned to Registrar General 1st Quarter 2nd Quarter 3rd Quarter 4th Quarter Total Nil 2 9 3 14 Outbreaks Due to Identified Agents : Total Outbreaks 1 Total cases 16 Outbreak due to Staphylococci aureus. Outbreaks of Undiscovered Cause: Total outbreaks 2 Total cases 310 6 316 Single Cases: Agent identified 5 Unknown cause 3 Total 8 (4 Salmonella organisms) (1 Staphylococci aureus) The outbreak due to staphylococci aureus occurred at a wedding reception held within the Borough and attended by 44 persons. About three hours after partaking of a meal, 16 guests became ill with diarrhœa and vomiting and were removed to hospital. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from faecal specimens. Samples of all unconsumed foods and drinks were collected by the hospital authorities and on examination a growth of staphylococcus aureus was obtained from cooked tongue only. The tongue, which was purchased by a Mrs. B, a guest who lived outside the Borough, was cooked and pressed at her home in hygienic conditions and brought over to Acton on the day before the reception. It was put into a cellophane bag and stored in a cool place. On the morning of the reception it was sliced and placed on 26 plates, together with other meat (cold roast beef and ham) by a Mrs. F. who lived within this Borough. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from a throat swab taken from Mrs. F. and this was the same type as that isolated from the tongue. A faecal specimen submitted by Mrs. B. to the Medical Officer of Health of the area in which she lived proved negative. Negative nose and throat swabs were obtained from other persons who assisted at the reception. It appears likely that the tongue was infected by Mrs. F. although in the absence of nose and throat swabs from Mrs. B. this is not certain. The large outbreak of undiscovered cause occurred in a canteen of a large block of offices, serving 1,000 lunches per day. On the 6th October, 800 persons had a meal which included steak and kidney pie with gravy. From 8 to 18 hours after, 310 became ill, the main symptoms being flatulence, colic and diarrhoea. The illness was only moderately severe and lasted from 6 to 12 hours. No pathogens were isolated from faeces of cases or food handlers. In the provisional report of the Pathological Laboratory, Clostridium Welchii was present in the specimens of food submitted, but subsequently it was found not to be the heat-resistant strain, it being killed at 80° in 10 minutes. The Pathological Laboratory have stated that the particular strain of Clostridium Welchii found was not a proven pathogen, and in the absence of any other pathogenic organisms they must provisionally conclude that the outbreak was toxic in origin, probably staphylococcal, and that the organisms themselves were killed in the re-heating, leaving the toxin intact. After investigating the preparation of the meal, the manageress was advised of the potential danger of cooking meat in large bulk, leaving it in a warm kitchen overnight and re-heating the following day. Another factor investigated was the large number of house sparrows which were living and Inesting within the restaurant. Faecal specimens were obtained and submitted for examination, but no pathogenic organisms were found. Subsequently various screening measures to windows were carried out to prevent the ingress of sparrows, and in addition the kitchen premises were redecorated. The remaining outbreak was restricted to 6 members of one household!. Faecal specimens obtained 3 days after onset were negative, and all suspected food had been consumed before notifications were received. 27 TUBERCULOSIS Age Periods NEW CASES DEATHS Respiratory Non-Respiratory Respiratory Non-Respiratory Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female 0 — — — — — — — — — 1 — 1 — — — — — — 5 — 1 — 1 — — — — — 15 — 6 9 — 1 — — — — 25 — 7 6 1 3 — — — — 35 — 2 1 — — 1 1 — — 45 — 8 1 3 — 2 — — — 55 — 5 4 — 1 — — — 65 upwards 6 — 1 — 4 2 1 — 36 21 6 4 8 3 1 — 28 STATEMENT OF PARTICULARS APPEARING ON THE REGISTER OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS—1953 Pulmonary NonPulmonary Total (a) Number of cases of tuberculosis on the Register at the commencement of the year 564 males 80 males 389 females 99 females 1,132 (b) Number of cases notified for the first time during the year 36 males 6 males 21 females 4 females 67 (c) Number of cases previously removed from the Register which have been restored thereto during the year 2 males — males 2 females — females 4 (d) Number of cases added to the Register other than by notification during the year 19 males 2 males 15 males 1 female 37 (e) Number of cases removed from the Register during the year 16 males 2 males 6 females 3 females 27 (f) Number of cases remaining on the Register at the end of the year 605 males 86 males 421 females 101 females 1,213 SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS As in previous years, cases suffering from the above conditions have been referred to the Kensington Medicinal Baths for cleansing treatment. 29 During the year 26 persons were treated for dirty heads. Nine of these were referred for treatment by the medical staff of factories within the Borough. Ten persons were treated for scabies. SECTION E HOUSING I am indebted to the Borough Engineer for the following information showing the progress made since the end of the war. Temporary Prefabricated Dwellings. Occupied 31.12.53 232 During the year 18 temporary dwellings were removed from 3 sites to make way for permanent development. 54 permanent dwellings will be provided in their place. New Permanent Dwellings. (1) Within the Borough: (a) Completed and occupied 31.12.53 764 (b) Contracts let or under construction 31.12.53 140 (c) Schemes in preparation 165 (2) Outside the Borough: Completed and occupied 31.12.53 435 1,754 Rebuilt War Destroyed Dwellings. (1) By the Council: Completed and occupied 31.12.53: — Council Houses 8 Private Houses 36 44 30 (2) Under Private Licence: Completed and occupied 31.12.53 230 230 274 SECTION F SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The whole of the population is supplied from the public water mains direct to each house and the supply has been satisfactory. Waste of water has been notified to the Metropolitan Water Board on 57 occasions and, in addition to saving a measure of water supply, these notifications have been the means of preventing nuisance from dampness in many cases. In addition to the public supply, there are three deep wells in the district, two at factory premises, and one at the Public Baths. Samples of water from these wells have been taken from time to time and on submission to bacteriological and chemical examinations have proved satisfactory. In the course of the year a total of 57 samples of water were submitted to the Council's analyst or pathologist for examination as to chemical or bacteriological content. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE All the dwelling houses are provided with water closets and are connected to the sewerage system which discharges, by an arrangement with the L.C.C., into the London sewers. Storm water is filtered and emptied into the Thames. 31 PUBLIC CLEANSING The amount of house refuse collected by the Council in 1953 was 15,277 tons and trade refuse collected amounted to 1,446 tons. All was removed to controlled shoots. In addition to the foregoing, 2,522 tons of salvage were sold. RODENT CONTROL Test baiting of public sewers and treatment as necessary have been continued in accordance with the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The services of the Council's Rodent Destruction staff have been divided as occasion has demanded between destruction of newly discovered rats and mice by intensive treatment, and the regular visiting, examination and treatment of business premises to prevent infestation. There is no serious infestation of rats or mice in the Borough, and there can be no doubt that this is largely due to the Council's policy and practice of maintenance treatment in business premises, particularly those where food for human consumption is manufactured or stored. Investigation, destruction and maintenance have entailed a total of 4,296 visits by the Rodent Operatives, 1,923 to business premises and 2,373 to dwellings, in addition to inspections by the Sanitary Inspectors as noted elsewhere. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1991 Under the above Act, sixteen premises are registered for the manufacture of articles of upholstery, toys, etc., and two premises were licensed for the storing of rag flock. In the course of inspections it has been noted that rag flock and other filling materials are stored and used so as to be maintained in hygienic condition. One informal sample was taken and on analysis found to be satisfactory. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints registered at the counter was 1,263, and by letter 91. INSPECTION OF FACTORIES The number of factories in the Borough has fallen to 645 and these have been subject to inspection by the Sanitary Inspectors to ascertain that the provisions of the Factories Act, 1937, and regulations as to sanitary accommodation are complied with. The usual work of inspection of factory canteens has been 32 tained, and advice given as necessary as to fitness or otherwise of food for human consumption. The home addresses of 94 outworkers engaged in work at home for Factories within and outside the Borough, have been visited to ascertain hygienic conditions and freedom from infectious disease.

Inspections of registered food premises are carried out from time to time and further action taken as necessary to ensure the premises and method of production being maintained at a satisfactory standard. Members of the Sanitary Inspectors staff from time to time give lectures with film strip displays to stimulate and maintain interest in food hygiene and the general work of the Public Health Department. 37 DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED FOOD Condemned food noted in the report is disposed of as follows: — At the large slaughterhouse and bacon factory in the Borough all diseased or unfit carcases, parts of carcases and offal are destroyed under the supervision of the Council's Meat Inspectors in a special plant producing inedible material—bone meal, fertilizer, etc. The rest of the surrendered diseased and unsound food material is disposed of either for animal feeding purposes or by burning in a destructor as appropriate. FOOD INSPECTION Reference to special examinations of consignments of food follow in this section of the report and while details of the quantity condemned are noted, it is not practicable to collate total quantities. The amount of food-stuffs surrendered owing to deterioration or damage is largely related to the extensive work of food manufacture and distribution in the Borough. Under the direction of the various Departments of the Ministry of Food, much inferior food material is received into the Borough for manufacturing purposes subject to control by the Local Authority, and the Sanitary Inspectors carry out necessary examinations to ensure that only sound material is used; this accounts generally for the bulk surrenders of meat. There are two large wholesale grocery Depots within the Borough, and hence surrenders of canned and packeted goods are made to this Authority; these surrenders constitute the major part of such foodstuff noted. The following list collated for convenience shows some details of the surrendered food-stuffs: Bakers Sundries 3 cwts. 2 qrs. 18 lbs. ,, ,, 19 cartons Cereals 38 packets Cheese 4½ ozs. Eggs, shelled 33 lb. Fish, wet 3 cwts 3 qrs. 1 st. 10 lbs. tinned 608 tins Fruit, tinned 28,921 tins dried 654 lbs. 38 Ham, tinned 1,184 lbs. Meat: — Fresh 10,062 lbs. Tinned 2,026 tins Corned beef and mutton 13 tins Offal 401 lbs Rabbits, fresh 70 lbs Sausages 4 lbs. Milk, Condensed 2,919 tins Pastes, Pickles, etc. 121 jars Poultry: — Chickens, tinned 1 tin Preserves 934 tins Puddings, sweet and savoury 45 tins Vegetables 3,431 tins FOOD COMPLAINTS There were 22 complaints as to unsound food etc., and in 5 cases the Council decided to send strong warning letters to the firms or persons who sold the food which formed the subject of the complaint. MILK The number of dairies in the Borough has been reduced to three owing to the increasing practice of distributing milk wholesale in bottles from large bottling depots to local depots, for delivery by roundsmen, or over the counter in milk shops. Of 62 samples taken throughout the Borough and submitted to the Pathological Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, there was only one failure in respect of the methylene blue test, while all phosphatase tests were satisfactory. The wholesale, pasteurising and bottling centre in Bollo Lane has continued in operation without cause for complaint, and 30 empty bottles taken from the filling lines for examination as to sterility, were found to be sterile. 39 The following licences were granted under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949 and 1950, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1919 and 1950. Dealers' Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 21 Pasteurised Milk 30 Sterilised Milk 28 Supplementary Licences: — Tuberculin Tested Milk 12 Pasteurised Milk 13 Sterilised Milk 13 117 ICE-CREAM The number of manufacturers of ice-cream in the Borough is now 6. Each of them is equipped to produce pasteurised ice-cream, and production is in every way in accord with the Ice-Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1947/1952. There are 118 premises where ice-cream is not manufactured, but where the commodity is sold in the main from pre-packed stocks. During the year 157 samples were taken, 94 of ice-cream manufactured in the Borough, and 63 from shops or itinerant vendors trading in icecream manufactured outside the Borough. The grading of samples noted below and expressed in percentages indicates the very good standard of ice-creams manufactured in the Borough. Grade I 100% Grade II —% Grade III —% Grade IV —% Premises, plant, processing and storage conditions are well and satisfactorily maintained. 40 FOOD AND DRUGS The Middlesex County Council are the Food and Drugs Authority in this area, and the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department has supplied the following figures and notes: — List of samples procured in the Borough of Acton during the year. Article Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 158 4 Almond Mixture 1 — Blackcurrant Syrup 1 — Cakes 7 — Camphorated Oil 7 — Cheese 1 — Chops 3 — Condensed Milk 1 — Cooked Meat 16 — Cream 2 — Drugs 4 — Fish 10 1 Fish Cake 1 — Ice Cream 6 — Icing Sugar 1 — Jelly 1 — Lamb 1 — Meat Paste 1 — Meat Pie 4 — Minced Meat 1 — Non-brewed Condiment 1 — Sausages 23 — Sausage Meat & Rolls 8 — Self Raising Flour 2 — Stewing Meat 2 — Suet 1 — Sweets 3 — Tripe 1 — Wines & Spirits 19 5 Vinegar 20 6 307 16 41 "With regard to the samples noted as unsatisfactory the following comments may be of interest. "Of the four milk samples three were of hot milk procured from a cafe ; each was slightly deficient in fat and an official caution was sent to the proprietor. The fourth was from a churn of new milk sent from a farmer to a milk processing depot in your borough. This sample was slightly deficient in milk fat but as samples from six other churns all forming part of the same consignment from this farmer were genuine, no further action was taken. "In respect of the six samples of vinegar, two samples were obtained from each of three local shopkeepers. In every case nonbrewed condiment was sold. Two of these traders were prosecuted and each was fined £2 and £1 15s. Od. costs. An official caution was sent to the third trader. "The five unsatisfactory samples of spirits were all obtained from the same licensed premises and the licensee was prosecuted and fined a total of £15 15s. Od. and 7 guineas costs. The sample of smoked haddock was unsatisfactory as smoked cod was supplied. The trader concerned was also prosecuted and fined £1 and 1 guinea costs. "The following brief notes relate to other activities by my Council by virtue of their duties as Food and Drugs Authority. Special Designated, Milk "During the year one dealer/processor was licensed to use the special designation "pasteurised" in connection with milk processed at their premises. Eight inspections were made of these premises and fifty-two samples of "pasteurised" milk were procured, none of which was adversely reported upon. Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1926 "Attention has been paid in particular to compliance with the Imported Food Orders made under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1926 and which require in respect of specified foods that when, inter alia, they are exposed for retail sale they must bear a clear indication of the country of origin, that is to say either the words "Empire" or "foreign" as the case may be or the specific country of production. 96 premises were visited and 281 head of poultry, displays of meat, or stacks of apples, tomatoes, dried fruit were examined. The only infringements were of a minor character and these were dealt with on the spot. 42 Labelling of Food Order, 1958 "88 premises were visited and 345 different articles of food were examined to ensure compliance with this Order. No infringement of substance was discovered." TOTAL NUMBER OF CARCASES INSPECTED WITH DETAILS OF SURRENDER ON ACCOUNT OF DISEASE Pigs Horses 1. Number killed 154,810 2,577 2.

On April 8th there was an outbreak of foot and mouth disease near Northolt and the Borough was included in the resulting infected area. Because of further outbreaks, this area continued in being until May 23rd. During this period over 2,200 licences were issued by the department and over 17,000 pigs were moved into the Borough on licence. During the early part of the year there was an increase in the number of outbreaks of swine fever in certain parts of the country. In order to prevent the further spread of infection, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries decided to impose restrictions governing both the holding of markets of swine and the movement of swine into, out of and within certain areas. The Swine Fever (Infected Areas) Order, 1953, came into force on 27th April and was not completely revoked until 20th November. During this period over 30,200 pigs accompanied by over 4,200 licences were received at the slaughterhouse in Atlas Road. Because of the numbers of pigs coming in from one of the infected areas, it was necessary to maintain the two additional inspectors on duty from April 8th for the purposes of ante-mortem inspection, receiving and examining licences and supervising the cleansing and disinfection of vehicles until the Swine Fever (Infected Areas) Order was finally revoked. These additional duties, lasting continuously for a period of 229 days—almost twice as much as last year's figure—once again resulted in the working of a considerable amount of overtime by the inspectorial staff and this totalled over 900 hours. 45 SECTION J ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The three deposit gauge and seven lead peroxide stations were maintained during the year and, for the first time, enable comparison with the previous annual figures. ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY THE LEAD PEROXIDE METHOD The monthly figures for each station for the years 1952 and 1953 are given in the table on page 46. The average figure for the year was 2.10 an increase of some 10% over the previous year's average. The stations with the highest average figure—2.29—were Town Hall and Bashley Road; that with the highest monthly figure was Bashley Road—3.73. The station with the lowest average—1.87— and the lowest monthly figure—0.64 was Acacia Road. Once again, the figures show an increase in the amount of atmospheric sulphur in the Borough, although no station reached the very high levels of pollution recorded during the notorious fog of December last year. The monthly average for all stations is shown in a graph on page 47. DEPOSIT GAUGES The monthly figures for the amount of solids deposited at the three stations is given on page 48. Once again, the highest average figure—28.79—and the highest monthly figure—43.69—was reached at Bashley Road, and the lowest average figure—16.81 and lowest monthly figure—10.13 was recorded at Kendal Avenue. These results show an increase of some 7% over those for 1952, but the amount of combustible material in the deposited matter dropped from 20% of the total to 17%. The average monthly deposit for all stations is shown in a graph on page 47. The table on page 48 gives the average monthly rainfall. 46 ESTIMATION OF ATMOSPHERIC SULPHUR BY LEAD PEROXIDE INSTRUMENTS Weight of S03 in Milligrams per 100 Square Centimetres per day.

During the year 9 new cases were admitted. TUBERCULOSIS—SPECIAL SURVEYS During the Autumn term of 1953 it was decided to Tuberculin patch test the new entrants into Infant schools. In the first place it was done in two schools only with a view to making this a regular practice in all infant schools in the Borough. 106 children were included in this group, of which two, 1.87%, showed a positive result. Both children were referred to the Ealing Chest Clinic for further investigations. One child developed later a primary complex. The other child showed a normal X-ray of the chest. A special survey was carried out on children in one of the Secondary Modern Schools who had been in contact with a teacher who developed pulmonary T.B. 202 children were involved, of these 157 were negative, 30 had a positive reaction and 15 were not tested for various reasons. The figure of 30 positive was within the normal limit of positive results in the age group and therefore, in consultation with the Chest Physician, no further steps were taken. 53 AUDIOMETRY SCHEME The following table shows the number of children tested by Gramophone Audiometer with details of failures. All children who fail the test are examined by the Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist, who recommends the appropriate treatment. 1 2 3 FAILURES 7 4 5 6 Total of School Population in Area Total tested by Gramophone Audiometer Absentees.
