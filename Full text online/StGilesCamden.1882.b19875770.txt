(9) The Decease and Retirement of Members. Mr. Joseph Lough, of No. 69, Great Queen Street, for some years an active member of the Board, died in the month of February last. The Board received the intelligence of his decease with sincere regret, and offered their sympathy with his widow and family. The Board also have to regret the retirement of George Evelyn Cower, Esq., of Tavistock Street, Bedford Square, by reason of declining health. Mr. Cower was a very intelligent and active member for several years past, and his withdrawal is in consequence much felt. Railway Bills of the present Session. The Plans and Notices deposited with this Board were— 1st. The Central Metropolitan Railway, from the Metropolitan Railway, King's Cross Station, through Southampton Row, Great Queen Street, Long Acre, and Parliament Street, to the Victoria Railway Station. 2nd. The Mid-Metropolitan Railway, from Uxbridge Road to the Minories, through Holborn and Oxford Street. The Bill of the first-mentioned Company was petitioned against by 26 owners and occupiers on the line, and amongst them by this Board, and was rejected on the second reading in the House of Commons without a division. The other Company, viz., the Mid-Metropolitan Railway, fell through, owing to the promoters failing to make the usual Parliamentary deposit. (10) The Electric Lighting Act, 1882. This Act, which came into operation on the 18th August, 1882, granted powers to the Board of Trade from time to time to license any local authority, as defined by the Act, or any company or person, to supply Electricity for any public or private purposes within any area, subject to the consent of the local authority, with such conditions as, subject to the approval of the Board of Trade, the local authority might prescribe, for a term not exceeding seven years, renewable upon such terms and conditions as the Board of Trade may determine. By the 4th Section the Board of Trade is authorized to grant Provisional Orders, and the local authority may, within six months after the expiration of a period of 21 years, or such shorter period as is specified in the Special Act confirming the same Order, require the undertakers named in the Special Act to sell to them their undertaking upon the conditions therein mentioned. The Act contains numerous provisions for controlling and regulating the powers of the undertakers, and enabling the Board of Trade to rescind the Provisional Order on failure by the undertakers to perform certain conditions. Under this Act several companies and individuals gave notice of their intention to apply for Provisional Orders to supply parts of the area of this District, among which were the following:—The Edison Electric Lighting Company, Limited; the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light Company, Limited; the Pilsen Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited; the Swan Electric Light Company, Limited. (11) The Edison Company proposed to take all the streets and places south of Holborn and Great Queen Street; the Metropolitan Brush Company the entire District of the Board; the Pilsen Joel Company the south side of Holborn, Great Queen Street, and streets running thereinto; and the Swan Company other parts of the District. The Draft Provisional Orders were forwarded to the Board by the several Companies, except the Swan Company, which abandoned their notice to supply any portion of the District. Very serious objections arose on consideration of such Draft Orders, and the Board were requested by the Board of Trade to forward their objections to the same. After long and careful consideration and consultation with counsel and a celebrated electrician, these objections were lodged with that Board; and after some time, that Board prepared and issued long and special conditions to be incorporated in all such Orders, and subsequently held a Meeting at Westminster Session House, of which notice was given to vestries and district boards whose areas were proposed to be dealt with. At such Meeting, on the 10th day of May, 1883, the Edison Company withdrew their notice of application for a Provisional Order, as also did the Swan Company; and after long deliberation and debate it was agreed that the Metropolitan Brush Company should comprise in their Order the north side of High Holborn and New Oxford Street, and the east side of Tottenham Court Road up to Bayley Street; and the Pilsen Joel Company the south side of High Holborn and New Oxford Street to Little Queen Street. The rest of the District remains unprovided for. The Board of Trade has approved of these terms, and (12) the Draft Provisional Orders have been made and now require to be confirmed by Act of Parliament. The Board considers that these Orders comprise important rules and regulations which will be found of much advantage to the Inhabitants of the District who may require to use Electricity. Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. Little Coram Street Scheme. Nearly the entire buildings on this area have been removed, and it is stated that the work of erecting new buildings will shortly be commenced by the Peabody Trustees. Artizans Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875. Artizans Dwellings Acts 1868 and 1879. These Acts have continued to be the subject of the careful consideration of a Select Committee of the House of Commons, which has made its Report. Drinking Fountain, Lincoln's Inn Fields, In the middle of the year 1882, Mrs. Philip Twells erected at a considerable expense a polished granite Drinking Fountain, on the Garden side, at the south-east corner of Lincoln's Inn Fields, on which is an inscription that it is erected to the memory of "Philip Twells, of Lincoln's Inn, Barrister-at-Law, and some time Member of Parliament for the City of London." It presents a very handsome and pleasing appearance. (13) Public Mortuary and Coroner's Court, Goldsmith Street, Drury Lane. This building was completed and opened for use in the month of April, 1883, when the first inquest was held, 27 bodies have since been received, several post-mortem examinations made, and 22 inquests held. Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The articles analysed during the year were 183. Proceedings were instituted in eleven cases, and convictions obtained. The fines and costs imposed by the magistrates amounted to £30: 2s. 6d. The continuous enforcement of the Act in this District still produces a very considerable abatement in the sale of adulterated articles of food. Dr. Redwood, the able Analyst, continues the Analyst of this Board. His Report is subjoined. Nuisances Removal Acts. During the year 39 summonses have been heard and adjudicated on by the magistrates; the orders have been either complied with by the owners of the premises wherein the nuisances existed, or they have been carried out by the Board at the cost of such owners.

GILES DISTRICT. Surveyor's Office, 197, High Holborn, 26th June, 1883. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the following Report on the Works executed by your Board during the year ending 25th March, 1883. Pavings. The carriage-way of Great Wild Street was re-paved with new 3" x 7" granite, on a concrete foundation, at a cost of £442: 17s. 6d. Bayley Street was re-payed with re-dressed granite, on a concrete foundation, at a cost of £322 : 15s. 9d. New Yard, Great Queen Street, was re-paved with l-e-dressed granite, on a concrete foundation, at a cost of £414 : Is. The footway of Great Wild Street, east and west sides, (from Great Queen Street to Wild Court), was re-paved with new granite kerb, and York stone flagging, at a cost of £237 : 7 s. 8d. The granite carriage-way paving of Tottenham Court Road being in bad repair, the Board ordered it to be taken ( 32 ) up and re-laid, all defective stones to be taken away, and replaced with new granite of similar description. The new stone required for this purpose was purchased and arrangements made for commencing the work; when a memorial, signed by numerous ratepayers in the road, was presented to the Board, objecting to the carriage-way being again paved with stone, and asking that it might be repaved either with wood or asphalte. The memorial was considered by your Board, who ultimately resolved to repair the existing paving, and defer for the present the question of repaving it with wood or asphalte. The following macadamized roads were re-coated with broken granite, steam rollers being used to consolidate the granite after it was spread:—Chenies Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square (east side, south side, and portion of west side), Russell Square (south side, portion of north side and portion of west side), Arthur Street, and Brunswick Square. Relay of Wood Paving. The wood paving laid in Hart Street in September, 1875, and in New Oxford Street in April, 1878, by the Asphaltic Wood Paving Company, Limited, was towards the end of the year found to be getting into very bad condition, and the Board accordingly gave notice to the Company, under the terms of their contracts, to take up the same and repave the streets with new materials; this the Company was unable to do, and shortly after filed a petition in the Court of Bankruptcy, for liquidation. The Board thereupon decided to make good at once the most defective places ( 33 ) porarily with granite, and ultimately, on the 9th day of January, 1883, resolved to replace the wood paving with compressed asphalte. Tenders for this asphalte were subsequently received, when that of the Val-de-Travers Asphalte Paving Company, Limited, was accepted, and arrangements made to commence the work forthwith; but at the request of many of the inhabitants in the street, who presented a memorial to your Board, and waited on you by a deputation, the work was postponed until later in the season, and will probably be commenced towards the end of August. Sewers, No new sewers were constructed during the year. Street Cleansing. The cleansing of the public carriage-ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, drawn by horses, were used in sweeping the paved carriage-ways. The street-sweepings were carted away by contract, and amoimted to a total of 12,803 loads. The carriage-ways of High Holborn, New Oxford Street, Little Queen Street, High Street, Hart Street, and Great and Little St. Andrew Streets, were washed on several occasions during the year by means of watering-carts and the machine brooms. The cost of washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. C ( 34 ) Street-orderly Boys. Nino boys and one man (acting as ganger) were employed during the year in cleansing the public footways in the District during wet and sloppy weather, and in collecting the horse droppings on the surface of the wood paving in High Holborn, New Oxford Street, and High Street, in dry weather. Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses, and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. The water used for this purpose (including that used for street washing) was 3,388,000 gallons. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs of stand posts, &c., was 213 5 6 To contractor for horses, carts, and men 754 16 0 Total £968 1 6 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary men, horses, and carts, and performing the whole work at a cost of £1,900. Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year ending 25th March, 1883, was as follows:— ( 35 ) £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,035 13 3 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 218 10 8 Cartage of slop, street sweepings, and snow, and hire of horses for street sweeping, and sand-distributing machines 2,421 16 0 Total cost of cleansing for the year ... £4,675 19 11 Limewhiting Courts. The walls of buildings at the entrances to the Mews, Yards, Courts, Alleys, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and liraewhited during the year at a cost of £55 : 10s. 10d. Public Urinals. The public urinals in the district belonging to the Board are 18 in number, and contain 51 compartments; 11 of the urinals, containing 41 compartments, have water laid on to them, the others are without water. The whole of them are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Bainsbridge Street 5 compartments, Water Supply laid on.

The public urinal in Brewer Street, being strongly complained of by some of the inhabitants of adjacent properties, was closed temporarily with the view of ascertaining if its permanent removal would be likely to cause much nuisance or inconvenience. Observation was made of the site for several weeks afterwards, but no complaint has been made of its being closed, nor has any nuisance been observed to arise in consequence. Public Lighting. The work of substituting the new improved circular street lamps for those of the old square pattern was proceeded with during the year; the total number of these lamp-posts and lanterns erected in the District at Lady Day, 1883, was 403. The Siemens' Patent Regenerative Gas Burner Lamps that were fixed in March and April, 1881, on the refuges opposite to 198, High Holborn, and at the north end of High Street, not giving satisfaction in consequence of the light at them being frequently deficient in illuminating power, and the lamps on many occasions going out of lighting, the Board gave notice to the patentees to remove them, and they were accordingly taken away, and other lamps fitted with Sugg's burners fixed instead, ( 37 ) The large cylindrical-sliaped lamp on the refuge at the west end of Guilford Street, which was fitted with five 4 ft. fish-tail burners, was removed, and a Sugg's 50 candle power lamp was substituted for it. Street Refuges. The Metropolitan Board of Works recently constructed a new Fire Brigade Station at the eastern end of Theobald's Road, facing towards Hart Street, and finding that a crossing refuge belonging to your Board opposite to the new station obstructed the fire engines in going in and out the station, the Metropolitan Board requested you to remove the refuge ; this your Board accordingly did, and caused an adjacent refuge near to Southampton Row to be enlarged. No additional street crossing refuge was formed during the year, and the number now existing in the St. Giles District is 16, viz.:— In Bloomsbury St. South end, by Broad Street In Broad Street West of Endell Street Do. East of Endell Street Do. by Drinking Fountain in Endell Street North end, by Broad Street In Guilford Street West end, by Russell Square In High Holborn by Little Queen Street Do. at junction with New Oxford Street In High Street North end, by New Oxford Street In New Oxford St. East of its junction with Bloomsbury St. Do. West of its junction with Bloomsbury St. Do. by Hart Street Do. by Thorney Street Do. West end, by Tottenham Court Road In Theobald's Road West end, by Southampton How In Tottenham Ct. Rd. South end, by New Oxford Street. They are all well lighted, and afford great assistance to pedestrians in crossing the carriage-ways. ( 38 ) Improvement—Southampton Row. The vacant land (including the site of the old Bedford Head Yard) 011 the east side of Southampton Row, north of Theobalds Road, has, during the year been built on, and the widening of the public way of Southampton Row at that spot, agreed to be effected by His Grace the Duke of Bedford, has been carried out, and gives much additional convenience to the public traffic. Mid-Metropolitan Railway. Plans and Notices for the above Scheme affecting this District were duly deposited at the Private Bill Office in anticipation of the present Session of Parliament. The Scheme proposed a line of railway from the Uxbridge Road (near to the West Junction Railway) to the Minories in the City of London. The railway was to enter your District in New Oxford Street by Tottenham Court Road, and proceed thence along New Oxford Street and High Holborn towards the City. It was to be entirely underground, at depths of about 30 to 35 feet, and to be worked on the pneumatic principle, by stationary engines fixed at permanent stations on its line of route. The Promoters, however, did not comply with the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and the Bill was not proceeded with. ( 39 ) Electric Lighting, Various Electric Light Companies applied to Parliament during the Session, 1882, for power to supply electricity for lighting and other purposes in the Metropolis and elsewhere, under powers similar to those of gas and water companies. These various Bills were referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, together with a Bill prepared by the Board of Trade, dealing generally with the same subject. The Committee, after hearing lengthy evidence on the matter, reported to the House in favour of the Board of Trade's Bill, which ultimately passed the Legislature and became law. It is known as the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, and its purpose is to " facilitate and regulate the supply of electricity in Great Britain and Ireland," and with that object gives very large powers to the Board of Trade, empowering that Board to grant licenses and Provisional Orders, authorizing local authorities, companies, and persons to supply electricity within certain areas. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, notices were served on your Board by the four following Electric Lighting Companies—The Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light Company, Limited; The Edison Electric Light and Power Company, Limited; The Swan United Electric Light Company, Limited; The Pilsen-Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited—seeking power to supply electricity within the St. Giles District. ( 40 ) These applications were referred by you to a Special Committee of your Board to consider and report upon, and 011 the recommendation of that Committee, your Board resolved to oppose the various Orders before the Board of Trade, with the view of obtaining such amendments in the same as were considered advisable; this course was adopted, and after considerable negotiations with the Companies and the Board of Trade, and after a "Local Enquiry," held by an inspector appointed by that Board, it resulted in Provisional Orders being granted by the Board of Trade to enable two of the said companies, viz., The Metropolitan Brush Electric Light Company, Limited, and the Pilseu Joel and General Electric Light Company, Limited, to light certain areas within the St. Giles District, and the other two companies referred to withdrawing their Orders. These Provisional Orders require confirmation by the Legislature, and will then become law. Drinking Fountain, Lincoln's Inn Fields. The Drinking Fountain presented to the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains Association by Mrs. Philip Twells was erected, by permission of the Board, at the south-east angle of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and was opened to the use of the public on the 21st August, 1882. Contracts. The following is a list of the Contracts entered into by the Board and now in force :— 41 ) Name and Address of tho Contractor. Nature of Contract. Term of Contract. J. J.

The length of the streets and roads is more than 1,600 miles. The area of London, being 122 square miles, is equal to a square of about 11 miles to the side. Assuming it to be crossed by straight roads at equal intervals there would be 145 such roads, each 11 miles long, and 134 yards apart. "Elevation.—The population of London resides at a mean elevation of 39 ft. above Trinity high-water mark; the elevation varying from 11 ft. below high-water mark in Plumstead Marshes to 429 ft. above high-water mark in Hampstead. "Houses.—At the census in 1881, there were within this area 486.286 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7*8 persons to a house, exactly corresponding with the proportion in 1861 and 1871. "Annual Rateable Value.—The annual rateable value of property in the metropolis in April, 1881, as assessed in accordance with the Valuation (Metropolis) Act. 1869, was equal to £27,405,488.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you the vital and sanitary statistics of the District for the year 1882. St. Giles District. Area in statute acres, 245. Density of population, 185 to an acre. The average elevation of the District is about 68 feet above Trinity high-water mark. The estimated population (1882) of the District and its registration Sub-Districts according to the census returns of 1881, is St. George, Bloomsbury 16,002 St. Giles, South 16,337 St. Giles, North 13,733 Whole district 46,732 Estimated decrease of population (in the 10 years, 1872-82), 6,697. ( 46 ) Marriages and Marriage-Rate. The following table shows that during the year 1882 there were 357 marriages in the following churches, chapels, and buildings situated in the District;— Name of BuildiDg. Denomination. Number of Marriages, St. Giles in the Fields Parish Church, High Street Established Church . 136 St. George, Bloomsbury Parish Church, Hart Street Established Church . 130 Superintendent Registrar's Office 51 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 26 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 7 Little Wild Street Chapel Baptist 0 Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyau Methodist . 0 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed Church . 5 Ivingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street Baptist 0 Keppel Street Chapel Baptist , 2 Total 357 being 4 more marriages than in the preceding year. The marriage-rate was equal to 15.2 per 1,000 of the population. The average rate for the 5 years, 1877-81, being 14.9 per 1,000. St. Giles marriage-rate was 3'0 below that of London, where the marriages in 1882 numbered 35,414, giving a proportion of 18.2 persons married to 1,000 inhabitants. This London rate was far below the average. ( 47 ) Births and Birth-rate, During the past year 1,538 children, 778 males, and 760 females, were born in the District. Of these 1,181 belonged to the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 357 to the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The births registered in the three Sub-Districts were:— St. George, Bloomsbury 357 St. Giles, South 782 St. Giles, North 399 Whole district 1,538 equivalent to a birth-rate of 32.9 per 1000. But this birth-rate must be corrected by deducting 166 births—children of non-parishioners—148 born at the British Lying-in Hospital, and 18 at the workhouse. This deduction affects the registration Sub-District of South St. Giles, as well as the whole District, and the corrected numbers give a birth-rate of 29'7 per 1000, as will be seen by the following table:— Birth-rate in St. Giles and its Sub-Districts in 1882, and the Ratio of Births to Population, etc. Registration Sob-Districts. Estimated Population. Births (corrected.) Patio of Births to Population. Pate per 1,000. Average Birth-rate per 1,000 for 10 years 1872-81. St. George, Bloomsbury. 16,662 357 1 in 46.6 21.4 24.8 St..

The excess of registered births over deaths was 528. The birth-rate for London was 34-3 per 1,000. The birth-rate in England and Wales was equal to 33.7 per 1,000 persons living. Deaths and Death-rate. 1,010 persons died in the District during the past year, 496 males and 514 females. Of these 765 belonged to the parish of St. Giles in the Fields, and 245 to the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. The deaths registered in the three Sub-Districts were:— St. George, Bloomsbury 245 St. Giles, South 516 St. Giles, North 249 Whole District 1,010 From this total, 44 deaths of non-parishioners at the Workhouse, the British Lying-in Hospital, and the Infants' Home, must be deducted; and the deaths of 157 parishioners added who died out of the District in the General Hospitals and Institutions of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board. These corrections will give a death-rate of 24-0 per 1.000, as will be shown in the following table.

The death-rate for the whole parish of St. Giles in the Fields is 25*4 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole District is equivalent to 24'0 per 1,000, but if the deaths of parishioners who died in hospitals out of the District had not been added to the registered deaths, the death-rate would have been as low as 21*6 per 1,000, nearly identical with that of the whole Metropolis. I have carefully tabulated the deaths of parishioners who died in hospitals out of the district from the official books and records, as follows:— *It is impossible to apportion the corrected deaths in the Sub-Districts, therefore the death-rates, &c., are calculated from the number of registered deaths, ( 50 )  Hospitals and Institutions belonging to Metropolitan Asylum District Board.

Western „ . 19.9 Southern „ 20.7 Intermediate. The death-rate for England and Wales was equal to 19.6 per 1,000. The Death-rate among Infants and Young Children. 231 Infants died under 1 year of age, which gives 1 death for every 6.6 registered births. 418 Children died before they reached 5 years of age, which gives 1 death for every 3.6 registered births, (51) The Death-rate among Persons 60 years of age and upwards. The deaths of 264 old people were registered, which gives 1 death for every 4-2 registered deaths. The Workhouse, &c. 192 Persons died at the workhouse, Broad Street; 43 at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum; 14 at High gate Infirmary; 10 at Stock well, and 1 at Homerton Hospital; 1 at Darenth, and 7 at Caterham Asylums, making a total of 268 pauper deaths. Uncertified Deaths. The district compares favorably with many parts of the Metropolis in the small number of uncertified deaths, that is to say, deaths registered, but where the cause of death is not certified by a legally qualified medical practitioner, and those where the Coroner has deemed an inquest unnecessary. There were 6 uncertified deaths in St. Giles, all infants, but these were attended by medical students and midwives, and did not die from neglect or from the friends refusing to seek medical aid. Inquests. There were 77 Inquests held in the District; 22 of the deaths occurred in St. George, Blooms bury, 37 in St. Giles South, and 18 in St. Giles North. 2 D (52) The juries returned verdicts that 53 died from natural causes; 21 from accidents, and 3 persons committed suicide. The causes of death are set forth in the following table: Cause of Death. St. George, Blooms bury. St. Giles South. St. Giles North. Whole District. Deaths from natural causes, exposure, and neglect.

It was formally opened by the Coroner for Central Middlesex, Dr, Danford Thomas, who thanked your Board (53) for its public spirit in providing him and the ratepayers a suitable place for the holding of inquests, &c. He at the same time expressed his approval of the arrangements throughout the building, which were carried out by your surveyor under the directions of your Mortuary and Sanitary Committees. The following rules and regulations for the management of the building, drawn up after careful deliberation by the members of the conjoint Committee, are here appended for reference. Rules and Regulations For depositing Bodies in the Mortuary provided for the Parishes of St. Giles in the Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, situate in Goldsmith Street, Newton Street, High Holborn. 1. The mortuary is provided for the reception of bodies of persons who have died in the parishes of St. Giles in the Fields or St. George, Bloomsbury, and application for permission to deposit such dead body or bodies in the mortuary is to be made on a printed form to be obtained at the offices of the Board, situate at 197, High Holborn, or of the keeper in charge of the mortuary, and such application is to be signed by a relative or friend of the deceased, or by the Undertaker employed in the case. 2. Bodies will be received, free of charge, at the mortuary between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., and at any other hour in cases of emergency. The body is to be brought in a proper shell or coffin, and is to be removed from the mortuary by the relative or friend of the deceased, or by the undertaker, in a decent and proper manner, (54) within a period of live days, dating from the day on which the death occurred; but in cases of death from diseases of an infectious nature, the body is to be removed for interment within three days from the day on which the death occurred. 3. In the event of the relatives or friends, or of the undertaker, neglecting or failing to remove the body within such specified times, measures will be taken by the Board to cause the removal and burial of the body forthwith, and the expenses of removal and burial will be recoverable from the parties legally responsible. 4. No shell or coffin containing a body which has been brought to the mortuary shall, under any circumstances, be removed, save for the burial of the body contained therein, unless such shell or coffin, with the lid thereof, be properly painted inside and outside, or be lined or covered on the iuside with tinned copper, and be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. 5. If any shell or coffin sent with a body therein should prove to be in a defective condition, a thoroughly sound and larger shell in which the defective shell or coffin can be enclosed shall, upon notice being sent to the person depositing the body, be supplied by such person; and in the event of such person not supplying the same the Board will forthwith provide such larger shell or coffin and recover the expense thereof from the person sending such defective shell or coffin. 6. On the admission of a body into, or its removal from the mortuary, no public procession or large assemblage of persons will be allowed within the building; the only persons to be then admitted shall consist of the (55) tives of the deceased, the undertaker, and the bearers of the body. 7. The friends and relatives of a deceased person deposited within the mortuary may, except in cases where the death has occurred from infectious disease, visit the building daily, in numbers not exceeding three at a time, between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., and in the event of any person or persons causing disturbance, or behaving in an improper or disorderly manner, the mortuary keeper will cause such person to be forthwith removed from the building. 8. No post-mortem examination shall be made on Sundays, unless under urgent circumstances, with the sanction of the Medical Officer of Health. Sanitary Act, 1866, Sec. 27. As to the compulsory Removal of a Dead Body to the Mortuary.—On the receipt of a certificate signed by the Medical Officer of Health, or by any duly qualified medical practitioner, to the effect that the dead body of one who has died of any infectious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep, or that such dead body is in such a state as to endanger the health of the inmates of the house or room in which such body is retained, application will at once be made to a Justice for an order for the compulsory removal of the said body. Such order will specify the time in which the said body shall be buried, and the Board will, immediately on receipt of the same, cause the said body to be removed from the house in which it is retained and deposited in the mortuary, and shall give notice to the friends or relatives of the deceased of the time within which such body shall be buried, as specified in the said order, and in the event of their not burying the body within such time, the relieving officer of the parish will bury such body, and the expenses incurred thereby may be recovered from the person legally liable to pay the expenses of such burial, (56) FORM OP APPLICATION to be filled in by persons desirous of depositing bodies in the mortuary provided for the parishes of st. giles in the fields and st. george blooms bury.

He shall not receive gratuities of any kind from the friends or relatives of deceased persons. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. In the Year 1882, there were 171 confinements in this hospital, 85 of the children born were males, and 88 were females. There were two sets of twins. 7 children were still-born, 4 were males and 3 females. There was one supposed case of hermaphroditism which survived three weeks, and which proved on post-mortem examination to be a female. 148 of the children born were non-parishioners, their mothers being only residents in the district during the time of their lying-in. There were 4 deaths, 1 mother and 3 children; the mother, aged 30, died from ruptured perineum and septiccemia, the children (all males) died from premature birth, convulsions, and spina bifida. Praise is due to the (59) excellent management of this hospital, and in my experience the lying-in nurses trained here do credit to the matron. The Infants' Home, No. 35, Great Coram Street. There were 6 deaths in this house or home, all being described as children of female domestic servants; 4 died from atrophy and debility; 1 from convulsions; and 1 from diarrhoea. I am still of opinion that this and all institutions where such young children are received, should be registered and placed under official supervision. The Bloomsbury Dispensary, Streatham Street. Dr. Steele, the resident medical officer of the Dispensary, has kindly given me the following information respecting the number of the sick poor attended during the past year by the physicians and surgeons attached to the institution:- The Number of New Cases treated at the Bloomsbury Dispensary. 1882.

Mortality from certain Classes of Diseases. I. The Seven principal Zymotic Diseases—Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, WhoopingCough, Fever, and Diarrhcea. The death-rate from these diseases in England and Wales was equal to 2.6 per 1000. In London there were 13,553 deaths: 431 from smallpox; 2,329 from measles; 2,004 from scarlet fever; 8G3 from diphtheria; 4,647 from whooping-cough; 1,117 from fever (principally enteric or typhoid), and 2,162 from diarrhcea. The death-rate from these diseases in the aggregate was 3.49 per 1,000, the mean annual rate in the preceding decade having been 3.59. The most notable fact in regard to these diseases was the subsidence of the small-pox outbreak which began in 1876. The number of deaths from these seven diseases in St. Giles District was 156, and equal to a death-rate of 3.3 per (61) 1,000, 15 below the decennial average, but an increase of 14 over the preceding year; this increase was caused by the heavy fatality from measles. But this rate, as is seen, is a trifle lower than that of the metropolis. Small-Pox (London).—The fatal cases of small-pox, which had been 471 and 2,371, in 1880 and 1881, declined last year to 431, and were fewer than in any year since 1875. In St. Giles there were 3 deaths during 1882 (2 at Stockwell and 1 at Homerton Hospitals), against 10 for the previous year, the decennial average being 5-0. There were 31 cases removed to hospitals of the Asylum Board; 8 of the patients had not been vaccinated. In 1881 there were no less than 106 cases in the district, of which 71 were removed to hospital. No deaths from the disease were registered in the District. The patients resided, previous to removal to hospital, in the following places, all in the parish of St. Giles in the Fields:— Caroline Mews 1 Compton Street, New 3 Crown Street 1 Drury Lane 3 Dudley Street 1 Dyott Street 1 Edmonton Schools 2 (children of parishioners) Laurence Street 1 Macklin Street 2 Queen Street 1 Queen Street, Great 1 Carried forward 17 (62) Brought forward 17 Tower Street 1 Wild Street, Little 5 Workhouse 6 White Lion Street, Great 2 Total 31 Of these 4 were attacked in January, 9 in February, 4 in March, 10 in April, 1 in May, and 3 in August; from that date no case has been reported. The annual Vaccination Return of the district, kindly supplied to me by the Vaccination Officer, Mr. Yardley, is shown in Table No. XI., Appendix. Measles (decennial average, 28.4).—The 41 deaths in 1882, 13 above the average, were all young children; 31 of the deaths occurred during the months of October, November, and December. The disease was prevalent all over the metropolis, and the fatality was very heavy; in the majority of the fatal cases it is stated that the eruption was suppressed, and pneumonia, followed by typhoid symptoms, speedily caused death. Scarlet Fever (decennial average, 26.8).—There were 14 deaths, including one at Stockwell Hospital; of these 13 were children under 5 years of age, the other was an adult lady over 80 years of age. During the year 8 pauper patients were removed to Stockwell and 1 to Homerton Hospitals, and 5 non-pauper patients were sent to the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool road, at their friends expense. (68) The severe outbreak of Scarlet Fever which occurred in the month of January, 1882, in the Russell Square area of the district, was fully described in last year's Annual Report. No communication has yet been received from the Medical Inspector who was appointed by the Local Government Board to investigate it. Diphtheria (decennial average, 4.2).—The deaths were 21, all children but one; 11 died in the district, and 10 in the public hospitals of King's College, Charing Cross, and the Children's, Great Ormond Street. I can find no higher fatality from this disease in the district on record, but it must be observed that the disease was more than usually fatal in the metropolis. Whooping Cough (decennial average, 36.3).- Our deaths were 24, 12 below the average, all young children, but the all-London mortality from this disease was in excess of previous years. Fever, including Typhus, Enteric or Typhoid, and simple continued fevers (decennial average, 19.1).- The deaths in 1882 were 16. Twenty-three pauper patients suffering from Typhoid Fever were removed to Stockwell Hospital. Happily no cases of typhus were reported, but then its old and favourite haunts, viz., the filthy and dilapidated houses in the courts and alleys in Drury Lane and Little Coram Street have been swept away, and in the case of Great Wild Street and Drury Lane new and commodious dwellings have been erected in their stead, which are tenanted by a superior class of artizans and workpeople. (64) Diarrhcea (decennial average, 51.4). The deaths (37), owing chiefly to the cold Summer and Autumn, were below the average. 32 were deaths of children under 5 years of age, and of these 18 were infants under one year of age. The operation of the Adulteration Act may be a reason for this low fatality, through the better quality of the milk supplied to the numerous bottle-fed children in the poorer parts of the district, where the mothers are obliged to leave their homes to seek daily work. The other Zymotic Diseases. The remaining diseases in the Zymotic class require but few remarks. Croup was fatal to 21 children. Erysipelas caused 6 deaths. Puerperal or Lying-in Fever was fatal to one female, but in addition, 7 women died in childbed, but not from fever. Rheumatism, acute and chronic, killed 3. Syphilis destroyed 8; 7 being infants. Glanders.—1. A death of a cabman residing in Montague Mews was registered from Farcy (glanders). I immediately reported (65) this case to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and a veterinary surgeon was sent (under the powers conferred by the Contagious Diseases Animals Act) to examine the horses in the mews, but no evidence of the disease was detected. No other case either in man or horse was heard of in the district. II.—Pulmonary Diseases. (Excluding Phthisis.) The pulmonary class of diseases was, as usual, the heaviest in the death-rate, causing no less than 256 deaths, and was equal to a rate of 5.4 per 1,000 of the population. Bronchitis alone was fatal to 195, of these 73 were children under 5 years, and 77 were adults over 60 years of age, again showing that the fatality was greatest in the extremes of age. Pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) also caused a heavy death list of 51. The other deaths were attributed to laryngitis, pleurisy, and asthma. Ill—Tubercular Diseases. Phthisis, Scrofula, Rickets, and Mesenteric Disease. This class produced a total of 124 deaths, equal to a rate of 2.6 per 1,000 of the population. Phthisis, or consumption of the lungs, was, of course, the principal disease, and it destroyed 109 persons of the total deaths. E (66) The heaviest mortality (88) occurred between the ages of 20 and 60 years. 10 deaths occurred under 20 years, and 11 deaths between 60 and 80 years of age. IV.— The Wasting Diseases of Infants (under 5 years of age). Atrophy and Debility, Want of Breast Milk, Premature Birth. The 74 deaths in this class were equal to a rate of 1.5 per 1,000. 53 children died from atrophy and debility, 51 of these were infants under one year of age. There were 21 infants born prematurely, and who died shortly after birth. V.—The Convulsive Diseases of Infants (under 5 years of age). Hydrocephalus, Convulsions, and Teething. Tubercular Meningitis (Hydrocephalus, water on the brain) was fatal to 16 children. Teething to 11, and convulsions to 25. VI—Deaths from Violence. The number of deaths in this class is light, being only 24, but of these, no less than 14 infants under 1 year of age were found suffocated in bed with their parents. It is suggested that babies should not sleep in bed with their (67) mothers, the extra warmth of the mother's arm being unnecessary. A disused egg box is considered a capital substitute for a cradle by which this mishap may be avoided. The Small-pox and Fever Hospitals Commission. The Commissioners have issued a report which contains many useful and valuable suggestions, which I hope will become law. Correspondence has taken place between the Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government Board, and the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, in reference to carrying out the suggestions in the abovementioned Report of the Royal Commissioners. On the 3rd March, 1883, at a meeting of the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, on the motion of Sir E. H. Currie, it was resolved unanimously—"That in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board, urging upon them the importance of asking Parliament to confer upon the managers compulsory powers, not only for the purchase of wharves, &c., but also for the acquirement of additional hospital sites; and that in the meantime the General Purposes Committee be empowered to institute inquiries, with the view of ascertaining where such wharves and sites can be obtained. On the 17th March, 1883, at a meeting of the managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, it was moved by Mr. Carr (the able representative of the two parishes), and resolved—"That it be an instruction to the Committee of 2 E (68) the Eastern District Ambulance Station to remove to hospital the infectious cases arising in the parishes of St. Giles in the Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury. Sanitary Work. The summary of the sanitary work for the past year will be found in Table No. VI., Appendix. It is there shown that the sanitary inspectors made 11,776 visits and inspections, and served 1,318 orders on owners of properties for the abatement of nuisances and the sanitary improvement of houses and premises. Legal Proceedings had only to be taken against the owners of 45 houses for not carrying out the necessary sanitary works ordered by your Board. Convictions, with costs, were obtained in every case. In 23 cases in the Little Coram Street area the houses were so dilapidated and insanitary, that a magistrate's order was obtained for closing them until the owners had rendered them fit for human habitation. Most of these houses have since been demolished. Animals so kept as to be a Nuisance.—Complaint was made that a nuisance was caused by the keeping of a number of rabbits in a back room in a house in Great St. Andrew's Street. The usual notice was served on the owner, and the nuisance was speedily abated. Overcrowding.—38 notices were served on owners to reduce overcrowding on their premises. Your officers experience great difficulty in detecting overcrowding, in consequence of the legal hours for the inspection of houses being fixed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. The real overcrowding in the tenement dwellings takes place at nighttime, after the closing of the public-houses. (69) Slaughter-houses. On the 31st October the Middlesex Magistrates, at their Petty Sessions, held at the Holborn Town Hall, granted licenses for slaughter-houses to the following butchers:— Slaughter-houses. Licensees. No. 6, Drury Lane Mr. Elan. „ 23, Storr Street Mr. Belch. „ 11, Kenton Street Mr. Dunford. „ 11, M&rchmout Street Mr. Vincett. „ 36, do. do. Mr. Dobbins. Cow-houses. On the same day renewed licenses were granted to the undermentioned cow-keepers:— (1.) Mr. Rees Lewis, of No. i, Coal Yard, to keep 10 cows, in a shed 28 ft. x 17 ft. x 15 ft. = 7,140 cubic feet. (2.) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 56, Great Coram Street, to keep 6 cows, in a shed 29 ft. x 16 ft. x 8 ft = 3,712 cubic feet. (3.) Messrs. Bonner and Capper, of 19, Tavistock Mews, to keep 11 cows, in a shed 24 ft. x 22 ft. x 10 ft. = 5,280 cubic feet. As evidence that the slaughter and cow-houses in this district are kept in good sanitary order, no opposition was made to the renewal of the licenses, either by the Metropolitan Board of Works, or by your own officers. (70) Common Lodging Houses. Table No. XII., Appendix, shows that there are no less than 65 common lodging houses in St. Giles parish, with proper accommodation for 2,372 lodgers. The whole are under the supervision of a police serjeant, appointed for that purpose by the Commissioners of Police. Meat, Fish, &c., Unfit for Human Food. Your Inspectors have regularly visited the market streets, and have carefully inspected the different articles of food exposed for sale, but though complaints have been made of their inferior quality, yet upon examination there was no evidence of disease or putrefaction to warrant a seizure. Bakehouses. The condition of the London bakehouses, under the supervision of the Inspectors appointed under the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, according to the reports of the various sanitary authorities, is most unsatisfactory. In this District your officers visit the bakehouses as before the passing of the Act, and deal with them under the Nuisances Removals Act. Occasionally orders are served for lime-whiting and cleansing, and these as a rule are promptly attended to. Underground Dwellings. 15 notices were served on owners to close underground cellars used for sleeping purposes. (71) Rag and Bone Shops. The Inspectors reported that these shops were kept in fair cleanly condition, considering the nature of the business carried on in them. The health of our population throughout the year has been very good, this no doubt is largely owing to the many sanitary improvements which have taken place in the District, through the action of your Board.

( 84 ) ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST APPOINTED UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the year ending on the 31st of last March, I received from your Inspector, Mr. J. Hoyle, 183 samples for analysis, consisting of bread, butter, cheese, arrowroot, flour, black, white, and cayenne peppers, mustard, vinegar, pickles, tea, coffee, extract of coffee, chicory, cocoa, milk, jam, marmalade, orange jelly, Worcestershire relish, ketchup, pork, beef, and German sausages, collared head, black pudding, tinned beef and mutton, and gin. Of these samples I found fifteen to be adulterated; namely, eight of milk, two of black pepper, one of butter, two of raspberry jam, and two of coffee. The proportion of adulterated articles, therefore, has amounted to 8*2 per cent, of the whole. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD. 17, Bloomsbury Square, July 10th, 1883.
