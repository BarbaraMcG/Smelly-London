In accordance With the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during that time, and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1885. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial all airs generally, the Vestry have appended to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners tor Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent.— The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It has about 12miles of streets, of which 3½ miles are paved with wood, 1½ with asphalte, 4½ with pitching, 2½ with macadam, and 1½ mile of courts, yards, and passages. Population.— At the last census, which was taken in April, 1881, the resident population was ascertained to be 29,865 persons, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. In this enumeration, however, no account is taken of the large number of persons who are engaged in the Parish during the day, and reside away from their places of business. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 24. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the , Central London Sick Asylum District. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J. E. Kempe, M.A., is Rector. Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St. James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament, it now however forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative being the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith. The Register prepared in 1885 contains the names of 4,210 electors, viz. 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 477 Lodgers, and 3,729 possessing other qualifications. 15 There are also 181 registered voters for the County of Middlesex in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the parish of St. James. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected b\ the ratepayers of the Division. % Water Supply.—Four companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being as follow:— 1. Chelsea Water Works Company (Chief Office, 35, Commercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mali and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 05, South Morton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Water Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. 1 his company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office. 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as is situate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1800. The charges authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. 16 per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum, where the annual value of the house exceeds £30, but is less than £5O, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). The Coroner is Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths, the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The SubRegistrar is Mr. Thomas Matthew Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. BICENTENARY OF THE PARISH. The Parish of St. James, Westminster was formed out of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, by Act of Parliament, in the year 1685.

Ward No. 4 (Golden Square)— All parts of the said Parish of Saint James, Westminster, not included in the Wards hereinbefore particularly described. ST. JAMES'S CHAPEL AND BURIAL GROUND. As stated in the Report for last year, the Chapel and Burial Ground in the Hampstead Road, formerly belonging to the Parish, have been sold, and the Trust merely exists now for the purpose of applying the surplus funds as directed by the Acts of Parliament relating thereto. The sanction of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division), has been obtained to the erection of a block of dwellings for the labouring poor with the unapplied balance of the purchase money received from the London and North Western Railway Company for the Burial Ground, and some particulars of the scheme are given on page 64. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. This establishment has undergone extensive repairs during the year, and the extra expense entailed thereby necessitated the payment of £1000 from the poor rate for the purpose. It may be mentioned that the repairs now under notice represent the only thorough overhauling of the establishment since its enlargement in l861, and the first renewal of some 21 portions since the opening of the building in 1852. The cost of these repairs is somewhat increased by defects in construction and arrangement, which cannot now well be remedied, but would be avoided in the plans of a building designed at the present time. But the St. James's Baths and Wash-houses were among the first buildings of the kind erected in London, consequently no practical experience had then been gained as to the best means of providing for the requirements of the case. The Commissioners have paid large sums, from their surplus receipts, in some former years, in reduction of the poor rate, and when the establishment has been thoroughly renovated, it is anticipated that similar payments will again be made. Three vacancies occurred among the Commissioners in January, by effluxion of time, and were filled up by the reelection of Mr. 11. W. Burgess, and the election of Mr. J. Tapping and Mr. J. Styles. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 12, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1885, and the number of bathers and washers, on pages 122 and 123. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S SCHOOLS. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year bv the expiration of the term for which Mr. Frederick Crane had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. A statement of the accounts of the Schools for the year 1885 is given on page 126. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of 22 the Governors are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the period for which Mr. T. H. Elam had been elected, and that gentleman was unanimously re-appointed for the usual term of office. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1885 is given on page 127. THE CRAVEN PEST-HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz., St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present representatives of the Parish being Mr. F. Crane, Mr. J. Bonthron, Mr. R. W. Burgess and Mr. W. Winnett. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of beds in King's College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford out treatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1885 is given on page 128. MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, is administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1885 is given on page 131. 23 LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter s. It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. New Three per Cent. Annuities, and a statement of the accounts for the past year is given on page 130. OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 134 to 141 and statements of the accounts on pages 129 to 133. ANCIENT CHARITIES OF ST. MARTIN'S. The Vestry have given careful consideration to the draft scheme proposed by the Charity Commissioners for the administration of these Charities, and to an amended draft which was received subsequently. The points which the Vestry attach most importance are the constitution of the Governing Body and the proportional representation of the various Parishes interested. In both these respects, neither the first nor the amended draft meets the views of the Vestry inasmuch as it is proposed to create a certain number of cooptative Trustees, to which the Vestry object in principle. 24 and to assign only the same number of representative Trustees to St. James's as to the much smaller parishes of St. Anne, and St. Paul, Covent Garden. The representations made by the Vestry for the further amendment of the scheme were still under consideration by the Charity Commissioners at the close of the year. THE VESTRY Consists of 48 elected and three ex-offtcio Members, and was constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. It superseded an elected Vestry acting under the provisions of the statute 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers-of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. All the powers of the former Vestry and of the Paving Commissioners acting under Local Acts, as well as some of the functions of the Commissioners of Sewers, were transferred to the newly-appointed body.. An Act was passed in the year 1858 relative to the main drainage of the Metropolis, by which the Vestry, as the rating authority of the Parish, were required to meet precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works for a Main Drainage Rate not to exceed 3d. in the pound per annum. In 1862 the powers of the Vestry were enlarged by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, and in the following year turnpike roads in the Metropolis were transferred from Commissioners, who had power to levy tolls upon horses and other animals and vehicles, to the Local Authorities, whose expenses are defrayed from the rates. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869, and Money Acts of the Board, subsequently passed, besides making some alterations in the mode of assessing the expenses of the Board, have afforded increased facilities for the raising of money by Vestries and District Boards, of which the Vestry of St. James have availed themselves to a small extent. 25 The Vestry have also various powers under the Metropolitan Paving Act, 57 Geo. III., cap. 29, commonly known as Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Nuisances Removal Acts, the Metropolitan Building Acts, the Metropolis Gas Act, the Sanitary Act, 1806, the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868, better known as Torrens' Act, and other statutes. By the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, the Vestry are empowered to purchase samples of food and drugs for analysis, to appoint a Public Analyst, and to prosecute vendors of adulterated articles. Proceedings under these Acts during the past year are mentioned on page 69. There has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes, over the expenditure of which local authorities do not possess the slightest control. Thus, since the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855, the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage; (b) Fire Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges—purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. A statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes is given on page 35. STANDING ORDERS. Operative Resolutions in the nature of Standing Orders have been passed during the year as follows:— 27th May, 1885.—That the wood paring repairs be for the present carried out by the Vestry's workmen instead of by contractors (W. 9, p. 10). 27th May, 1885.—That in future the Accounts of the G&s Light and Coke Company be laid before the Lighting Committee tor examination instead of the Works Committee L.

THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday the 18th day of May, the places appointed for the purpose being—Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, King Street; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly : Golden Square Ward, National School II use, Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. The total expense of conducting the elections, including the hire of rooms and publication of notices, amounted to £1 10s. 6d., and an order for payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was accordingly made by the Vestry in accordance with the Statute. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 39 Finance and House Committee 25 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 23 Works and Improvements Committee 27 Lighting Committee 10 Special and Sub-Committee 32 Total 156 28 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Four Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the byelaws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. CHURCHWARDENS Were elected on the 9th day of April, when Mr. Frederick Crane, of 55, Regent Street, and Mr. William Cox, of 57, Pall Mall, were again unanimously chosen to fill this ancient office. SIDESMEN Were elccted by the Vestry on the 9th day of April, the under-mentioned gentlemen being selected to till the office: — Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. Samuel Morle, 102, Jerrayn Street. Mr. Robert Gurney Barclay, 69, Pall Mall. Mr. James MacMillan, 104, Jermyn Street. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the 9th day of April, to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held on the 24th of April, to act as Overseers for the year 1885-6, were:— Mr. John Malin, 107, Jermyn Street. Mr. Frederick Jenkins, 4 and 5, St. James's Place. Mr. Henry Venn, 42, Jermyn Street. Mr, William Yorke, 102, Berwick Street. 20 GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. In accordance with the requirements of the Local Act, 2 Geo. III., cap 58, the Vestry met on the 9th April, for the purpose of appointing twenty-one "substantial and discree" persons, either from their own body, or from among the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex or Westminster, or other "creditable inhabitants" of the Parish, such persons, together with the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor, to be called Governors and Directors of the Poor. A list of the gentlemen so appointed is given on page 11, and a statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Board on page 124. REPRESENTATIVE AT THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. The Vestry heard with much regret at their meeting held on the 3rd December, of the serious illness of Mr. T. II. Elam, who had represented the Parish at the Metropolitan Board of Works since the year 1877, and for many years usually presided over the meetings of the Vestry. A resolution was passed expressing the sympathy of the Vestry with Mr. Elam, and their hope that he might be speedily restored to health. Unfortunately, however, this hope was not realised, and a month later Mr. Elam intimated his intention of retiring from the Metropolitan Board of Works in consequence of his health having failed. This letter was taken into consideration on the 21 st January 1886, and a resolution was passed as follows:— That the Vestry do hereby record their deep regret that .Mr. Klam should have been compelled by failing health to sever his connection with the Metropolitan Board of Works, their appreciation of the value of his lengthened services to the Parish in numerous honorary capacities, and their earnest hope that he may be so restored to health as to admit of his again taking an active part in the proceedings of the Vestry, a duly tor which his ripened experience so eminently qualities him. 30 A letter was subsequently received from Mr. Elam, thanking the Vestry for their sympathy, and stating that if his health permitted, nothing would give him greater pleasure than to again preside over the deliberations of the Yestry. Mr. Elam, however, peacefully passed away on the 14th March. A resolution expressing the sympathy of the Yestry with the widow and family of Mr. Elam was unanimously adopted on the 25th March. Mr. John Bonthron was unanimously elected representative member of the Metropolitan Board of AVorks in succession to Mr. Elam. PREACHER AND ASSISTANT TO THE RECTOR. The appointment of Preacher and Assistant to the Rector having become vacant, the Rev. Reginald Dutton, M.A., of Trinity College, Cambridge, formerly curate of St. Martin-inthe-Fields was nominated by the Rector to fill the office. This nomination was consented to by the Yestry, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Act. 1 Jac., 2, cap 22, on the 26th November. A salary of <£100 a year is paid from the poor rate to the Preacher and Assistant under the provisions of the Local Acts of the Parish.. CLERK IN ORDERS. A vacancy having arisen in the Office of Clerk in Orders, by the resignation of the Rev. Lionel Davidson, on his preferment, the Rector nominated the Rev. Willis F. A. Lambert, M.A., of Wadham College, Oxford, in his place. This nomination was consented to by the Vestry, as provided by the Local Act, on the 2nd July. A salary of £30 per annum is attached to this appointment payable out of the "profits of the pews." 31 OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. The only change that has occurred among the Vestry's Officers during the year arose from Mr. Brooker, First Assistant in the Vestry Clerks Office, having obtained a more lucrative appointment elsewhere. The vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Mr. Brooker was filled by the appointment of Mr. T. H. Munsey, at a salary of £120 per annum. The salary of Mr. Crow, Assistant Clerk, was increased from £75 to £100 per annum, and the salary of Mr. Lund, Stoneyard Clerk, has been increased from £80 to £100. The Vestry have decided to transfer one of the Inspectors of Nuisances from the Sanitary Staff, and assign to him the oversight (under the direction of the Surveyor) of the work of Street Scavenging, the prevention and removal of obstructions, &c. A list of the officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries is given on pages 111 and 112. FINANCIAL. It will be seen on reference to the accounts given on page 106, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £16,729 19s. 2d. The sum of £72,248 16s. 8d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £75,400 11s. 2d., leaving a balance of £13,578 4s. 8d. on the 25th March, 1886. Against this cash balance, however, there were on the lastmentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £5,934 13s. 2d., with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £1,397 5s. 4d., leasing a surplus of £9,040 16s. 10d. From this surplus, however, there is to be deducted an instalment of the precept of the School Board for London, amounting to £6,393 6s. 7d., payment of which has been delayed this year, in con sequence 32 of the Board desiring to base their call upon the revised assessment arising from the recent re-valuation of property throughout the Metropolis, which does not take effect until the 6th April, 1886. There is thus a surplus of £2,647 10s. 3d. to be carried to the eredit of the present year. LOANS. Two loans for paving and sewer works have been taken up during the past year, amounting in the aggregate to £10,700. In each case the money was borrowed from the Metropolitan Board of Works for a period of five years at interest at the rate of £3 10s. per cent. per annum. A statement of the loans now outstanding is given on page 116. PROPOSED RATING OF GROUND RENTS. A letter was received from the Yestry of Lambeth in the month of November, inviting co-operation in representations to the Government in favour of legislation for the Rating of Ground Rents. The subject was carefully considered, and although at first sight the proposal seems reasonable and to afford a prospect of increasing the area of taxation, yet the Yestry felt compelled to dissent from the views of the Yestry of Lambeth in the matter, not being at all satisfied that the slightest benefit would accrue to the ratepayers at large by the adoption of the course suggested, while it is quite clear that if any proposal of the kind were carried into effect, a considerable increase in future ground rents would be inevitable. The equitable rating of ground rents, moreover, bristles with difficulties, and a logical measure would involve the rating of improved rents, rent charges, &c., all of which are merged in the-rack rent. 33 RATEABLE VALUE. Agreeably to the provisions of the Valuation of Property (Metropolis) Act, 1869, a general revaluation of the parish for the purposes of assessment was made during the year. The Valuation List was prepared under the direction of a small Special Committee appointed by the Vestry, and as revised by the Assessment Committee for the Westminster Union, and after the hearing of a few appeals by the Special Sessions, yielded a total as follows :— Gross Value £831,835 Rateable Value £694,201 The following figures show the amount at which the parish was assessed in the previous year and also at the last general revaluation. 1885 1881 Gross Value £824,295 £799,116 Rateable Value £687,949 £666,813 The new Valuation List comes into operation on the 6th April, 1886, and remains unaltered for a period of five years, except in cases where the annual value of the property assessed is increased or diminished. It may be stated that the total cost of preparing the Valuation List, up to the time of transmitting it to the Assessment Committee, only amounted to £130 15s. 8d., viz.:—Printing, £14 16s. 6d.; Clerical Assistance and Delivery of Notices, £107 14s. 6d.; and other expenses, £8 4s. 8d. RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows: Amount in the Pound. s. d. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police, County, and Lunatic Rates, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges)1 11 34 Amount in the Pound. s. d. General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, precepts of the School Board of London, and proportion of the Bridge Expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works 1 3 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 0 1 Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, for meeting the precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works, so far as relates to the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, Metropolitan Improvements, and general expenses of the Board ... 0 7 Total 3 10 The rates for the two previous years were 3s. 7d. and 3s. l0d. in the pound, respectively. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate— £ s. d Amount of rate as levied 64,568 19 1 Arrears of former rates 692 12 7 Rates on property assessed during the year 495 15 4 £65,757 7 0 Collected 61,660 l i • ' 7 Loss from empty houses, &c., 3,123 15 10 Arrears at cljse of year 973 9 7 £65,757 7 0 Other Parochial Rates— Amount of rates as levied 64,568 19 1 Arrears of former rates 780 4 0 Rates on property assessed during the year 495 15 4 - £65,844 18 5 35 £. s. d. Collected 61,692 10 4 Loss from empty houses, &c. 3,137 5 11 Arrears at close of year 1,015 2 2 £65,844 18 5 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry do not possess any control. although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers: Total amount expended, £148,530 2s. 3d.

It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £91,058 19s. 8d. of the total of £148,530 2s. 3d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. The efforts of the Vestry to reduce the rates by an economical administration in local affairs are thus to a large extent neutralised by the growing expenditure of Central Authorities. The following statement illustrates the enormous increase in the demands of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London during the last ten years :— 1876-7 1877-8 1878-9 1879-80 1880-1 1881-2 1882-3 1883-4 1884-5 1885-6 Metropolitan Board of Works 10,956 11,442 11,594 14,003 15,357 16,546 17,614 17,583 18,361 21,052 School Board for London 9,974 12,364 12,195 13,115 15,064 15,911 16,466 19,075 22,328 24,501 Total 2 1,930 23,806 21,789 27,123 30,421 32,487 34,080 36,658 40,689 45,553 37 The total amount raised with the local rates for these two Boards alone, during the ten years, is £315,536, being an average of £31,553 per annum. These precepts, which, in the year 1876-7, represented a rate of less than 9d. in the pound, had increased to a rate of nearly 1s. 4d. in the pound in 1885-6, and in actual amount have more than doubled in ten years. The precepts for the year 1886-7 show a decrease of £896 19s. 3d. in the demand of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and an increase of £1,071 12s. 9d. in that of the School Board for London. VESTRY PROPERTY. vestry Hall.—No repairs of importance have been required during the year. Stoneyard.—Some small additional space has been gained by the removal of the old disinfector, and the fixing of a new apparatus on a more convenient site. Disinfector.—A disinfecting apparatus of Mr. W. Lyon's manufacture has been fixed in the stoneyard, to replace a worn out apparatus of obsolete construction, at a cost of £236 12s. 6d. Sheds for the apparatus, trucks &c., were erected at a further cost of £40 10s. The disinfecting apparatus has been used on 36 occasions during the year, as compared with 93 for the previous twelve months. It may be remarked that from early in November 1885 until the close of the parochial year in March, the Parish was singularly free from zymotic disease. Mortuary.—The bodies of 32 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 43 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others he are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to 38 assist the vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thickly populated heighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfecting Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for Parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, and the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Wash-houses. The remaining six houses are let on repairing agreements, and realise a rent of £295 per annum, which, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. The Vestry have exercised the option reserved to them by the contract for street cleansing and dust removal entered into in the year 1884, and determined the contract at Ladyday, 1886. Tenders were invited by public advertisement, and: those of Mr. Covington for dust removal for the sum of £2,900 per annum, and of Mr. Mead for street cleansing for the sum of £1, 600 per annum, were accepted. These sums show a' 39 considerable advance on the tenders accepted two years since, the. total then being £3,200 per annum, compared with £4,500 on the present occasion. The enhanced cost of dust removal appears to be due to the larger supply of refuse as the Metropolis extends, combined with a diminished demand of ashes for brickmaking purposes in the suburbs, and the additional cost of removing the refuse to a greater distance than formerly. The contracts are entered into for a term of three years, terminable at the option of the Vestry at the expiration of the first or second year. Sixteen Orderly Boys have been engaged to keep the woodpaved carriageways clean, with fairly satisfactory results. Each boy is provided with a red jersey by the Vestry, so that he may the more easily be seen by drivers. The regular staff of road sweepers now employed by the Vestry numbers 18, and the total cost of the work of scavenging and dust removal for last year was £4,727 6s. 4d.. compared with £4,469 13s. 4d. for the previous year. Details of the cost will be found on page 110, Appendix B. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year:— Cart loads. Wugon loads. Dust 3,092 1,496 Slop 992 5,124 The cost of Street Watering last year was £907 13s. 5d., or £24 16s. 3d. less than in 1884-5. REMOVAL OF SNOW. Considerable inconvenience was caused throughout the Metropolis by the heavy snowfall which occurred on the 6th January, and the subsequent rapid variations in temperature. The snow came quite unexpectedly, for early in the day it was raining; the rain was succeeded by snow at about 6 40 o'clock, and the snow fell continuously until after midday, by which time it covered the ground to a depth of from 6 to 8 inches. Little could be done until the snow ceased falling, except in the way of clearing the channels and crossings. The whole staff of scavengers, supplemented by the paviours and 27 extra men, was kept at work until late in the evening. By 9 o'clock, when the men ceased work, a space had been cleared along the whole length of one side of Regent street and Waterloo Place from Oxford street to Pall Mall, sufficiently wide for a double line of traffic, the snow being thrown into the centre and to the sides of the road. Unfortunately a sharp frost followed, and the melted snow flowing from the centre of the street over the cleared surface speedily rendered the latter dangerous. Vehicles then turned into the snow, scattering it over the portion of the street which had just previously been cleared at considerable labour. Owing to the state of the streets throughout London, it was found impossible to obtain carts to remove the snow until 7 o'clock, when the contractor put a number to work. The following and two succeeding days, a large number of men and more carts were obtained, but the alternate thaws and frosts had caused the ice and snow to adhere so firmly to the wood-paved streets as to render its removal exceedingly difficult: the work of clearing the streets was thus considerably impeded. Another difficulty presented itself owing to the impossibility of obtaining shoots for the snow near at hand. It may not be deposited in the parks, or thrown into the river, and cannot be removed in any quantity through the sewers; while the Parish being remote from river, canal, or railwa frontages, or uncovered land, necessitated the carting to some distance, thereby of course lengthening the process of removal, especially as the roads to the shoot were snowed up or difficult of access from other causes. As a temporary measure, therefore, the snow was carted from the leading thoroughfares and deposited in Waterloo Place and the Squares, it being ultimately disposed of at shoots outside the Parish, 41 The following statement will give an idea of the labour and cost attendant upon clearing the streets on the occasion referred to:— Men employed. Horses and carts. Jan. 6 127 7 „ 7 157 8t „ 8 167 79 „ 9 80 29 „ 11 136 23 „ 12 54 18 „ 13 68 23 „ 14 84 15 873 278 The whole of the thoroughfares were cleared for traffic by the morning of January 12th, or within six days of the snowfall, hut heaps remained at the sides of some of the less important streets until after midday on the 14th. In consequence of the continuance of the frost, it became necessary to cart away the snow which had been temporarily deposited in Waterloo Place and the Squares. This second removal necessitated the employment of men, horses and carts as follows:— Men Horses and carts Jan. 15 77 129 „ 16 13 9 „ 18 .. .. 53 19 „ 19 73 56 20 21 20 267 263 It cannot be denied that considerable inconvenience was caused to the Parishioners, although it may be fairly urged that the approaches to the Parish remained in an almost impassable state, and therefore, however well and rapidly the streets of St. James's had been cleared, probably few, it any, additional persons would have been brought into the Parish. Two slight falls of snow occurred in January subsequently to the 6th, and to some extent delayed the cleansing of the streets, besides increasing the cost. 42. There were several snowstorms during the months of February and March, but no very great public vcnience was caused thereby. REMOVAL OF TRADE REFUSE. The right of the Dust Contractor to require payment for the removal of trade refuse having been questioned on more than one occasion, the subject was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration. A report was presented by the Committee to the Vestry on the 12th August, pointing out that following the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the contract for the removal of refuse excludes brick rubbish, drain soil, and the refuse of trades from the operation of the contract. The Act of Parliament provides that if any scavenger is required to remove the refuse of any trade, manufacture, or business, or of any building materials, he shall be entitled to reasonable remuneration. In case of dispute, two justices or a police magistrate may decide not only whether any specific refuse comes within the definition of the refuse of a trade, <fcc., but also what is a reasonable remuneration for removing any such refuse. These provisions seem to be equitable and reasonable, for while they do not prevent any tradesman disposing of the refuse of his business to the best advantage, either at a profit or at the least possible cost, they enable him, in the event of his not being able to make a more advantageous arrangement, to require the dust contractor to remove such refuse at a reasonable rate. It would be manifestly unfair to saddle the ratepayers at large with the cost of removing trade refuse for a section of the parishioners. CONTRACTS FOR WORKS AND MATERIALS. The contracts entered into in 1884 for a period of three years, terminable at the end of the first or second year, at the option of the Vestry, are still in force. 43 STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1885, there were 750 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 726 of which wore ordinary street lamps (525 burning cannel gas, and 201 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 20 were larger lamps attached to refuges. On the 25th March, 1886, the number of lamps was 728, showing a decrease of 22 in the twelve months; the proportion of different lamps is now 485 cannel gas street lamps, 218 common gas street lamps, 4 urinal lamps, and 21 refuge lamps. There are 34 lamps in Shaftesbury Avenue, the cost of lighting, extinguishing, and maintaining, which will in future be borne by the Vestry; these are not included in the above figures. The ordinary street lamps are lighted, extinguished, cleaned, and maintained by the Gas Company under an arrangement with the Vestry; the agreed sum is £2 11s. 2d. per annum each either for cannel or common gas, 2£ ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 3ft. of common gas. Larger street lamps are charged for at a proportionate price, but as regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,179 2s. 3d., as compared with £2,295 8s. 8d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of new lampposts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum ot £57 2s. 8d. The subject of Street Lighting has occupied much time during the past year, and several improvements have been effected. The lighting of Regent Street has been increased by the substitution of three lamps ot 80 candle power each for smaller lamps at refuges, and by affixing a burner consuming a fraction more than 4 cubic feet ol cannel ga^ p« r hour to each of the street lamps, in place of a burner pacing only 2J feet per hour. The extra annual cost lor gas conse- 44 quent upon these alterations will amount to about £100. The vestry have also decided to replace the street lanterns in Regent Street and Waterloo Place—many of which are defective and obsolete—with "Metropole" lanterns, by which it is anticipated the lighting of this important thoroughfare will be still further considerably increased. Larger burners have been fixed in Broad Street over the urinal, upon Ingestre Buildings, and at the north end of Berwick Street respectively, and additional lamps have been placed in Burlington Gardens, and Warwick Street, Golden Square. New lamp columns in harmony with those placed in the new street by the Metropolitan Board of Works, have been erected at Piccadilly Circus, at a cost of £4 each, exclusive of lanterns and fixing. An arrangement, has been made with Messrs. Sugg & Co. to substitute their lanterns for those of another maker which were originally fixed to certain of the refuge lamps, and to maintain the same for six years, the cost for purchase and maintenance to be the same sum per annum that the lanterns have hitherto cost for repairs only; at the expiration of the six years the lanterns will become the property of the Yestry without further payment. The Yestry have assented to the Metropolitan Board of Works fixing small tablets to the street lamps for the purpose of indicating the position of the fireplugs and hydrants. PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the following conditions:— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. 3. That all such lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such case as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 45 4. That no Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket-joint only. 6. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed lamps, with their dimensions, and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The Edison Electric Light Company having failed to comply with the conditions of their Provisional Order, the Board of Trade gave notice to the Yestry in the mouth of May of the revocation of the Order, known as the St. James's and St. Martin's (London) Electric Lighting Order, 1883, with a request that the notice might be published in two newspapers circulating in the district in two successive weeks. The notice was published accordingly in The Times and the West Middlesex Advertiser, of June 6th and 13th. With regard to the St. James, St. Martin, and St. George, Hanover Square (West London) Electric Lighting Order, 1884, notice was received in June from the West London Electric Lighting Company, the undertakers, of their intention to apply for a further Provisional Order in the ensuing session. The draft of the proposed Order, as well as of a private Bill, has since been deposited, and received the consideration of the Yestry. Under the Bill, the Company are seeking powers ot an exceptional character; its main provisions being to confer power upon the Company to acquire lands by compulsion, to vary the conditions of purchase ot the undertaking by the Local Authority, to extend the time allowed tor carrying out the compulsory works, and to restrain legal proceedings without the consent of the Board ot Trade. Some ot these provisions are contrary to the Electric Lighting Act, 1882. and the Vestry entertain a strong objection to a Public Act of Parliament of general application being modified in certain respects to suit one particular case. They have therefore 46 resolved to oppose the West London Electric Lighting Company's Bill, and to seek the co-operation in this course, of the Local Authorities in other portions of the area of supply. The Yestry have also asked the Board of Trade to withhold consent from the Provisional Order for which the Company are applying. Some correspondence had previously passed between the Yestry and the Company on the subject of the delay of the latter in commencing operations under their order which was granted in 1884, and the Vestry regretted to find that the Company held out little hope of carrying the Order into effect until more favourable terms had been conceded with respect to the compulsory purchase of the undertaking by the Local Authority. As the law stands, the Local Authority may, after specified notice, purchase the undertaking at the expiration of twenty-one years, or of every subsequent period of seven years, upon paying the then value of all lands, buildings, works, materials, and plant suitable to and used for the purposes of the undertaking, without any addition in respect of compulsory purchase, goodwill, or profits, either actual or prospective. These terms were settled by a Select Committee of the House ot Commons after a lengthened enquiry in 1882, and the West London Electric Lighting Company obtained their Order two years later, with a full knowledge of the conditions attached thereto. The Vestry could not therefore regard the explanation of the Company as satisfactory, and, as stated above, they would object to a Public Act of Parliament being altered to meet one special case. The terms may press unduly upon the Electric Lighting Companies, but in that case the most satisfactory course to adopt would be to amend the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, and leave Local Authorities in districts for which Orders have been granted and remained inoperative, free to enter into negotiations with competing companies under the altered conditions. The Vestry are watching the Bills now before Parliament for the amendment of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882. 47 LOCAL IMPROVEMENTS. The most important improvement which has been carried out during the year is the formation of the new street (Shaftesbury Avenue) from Piccadilly Circus to New Oxford Street, by the Metropolitan Board of Works, under the special Act of Parliament obtained by the Board in 1877. The Vestry will assume the charge of so much of this street as lies within the Parish of St. James, when the paving at the junction of certain streets has been satisfactorily completed, and has resolved to plant trees along each side thereof. Viewed from a financial standpoint, the formation of this new street is a direct loss to the Parish, inasmuch as the area to be paved, cleansed, and lighted is considerably increased, while much heavily rated property has been removed. This loss will, however, be diminished as the land now vacant is built upon, and the convenience of a direct route to Bloomsbury is unquestioned. The improvement of Little Pultenev Street is now approaching completion. Two minor local improvements have been considered during the year; one to set back the building at the north-east corner of Berwick Street, and the other to set back the projection of No. 9, Archer Street to the general line of the adjoining buildings. In view, however, ot the large outlay which would probably be involved, in comparison with the extent of the benefit to be derived by the public, the Vestry did not feel justified in effecting'either of the these improvements. NAMES OF STREETS. Several proposals for renaming streets have been under consideration. A suggestion was made to alvlish the name of Coventry Street, and to renumber the houses in Piccadilly, but it appearing that the resident tradesmen entertained a strong objection to the proposed alteration, and the existing name being sufficiently distinctive, the Vestry requested the 48 Metropolitan Board of Works not to adopt the suggestion, and the name remains unaltered. Another suggested alteration, to which objection was offered by the residents, was in the case of King Street, Regent Street; here also the name remains unchanged. Two orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board of Works during the year, for altering the names of streets in this Parish, viz.:— New name. Names abolished. No. of houses renumbered. Lexington Street. Cambridge Street and Little Windmill Street. 53 Ramilies Street. Blenheim Street. none The completion of the improvement at Piccadilly Circus, which involved the demolition of many houses, gave rise to much discussion, not only with regard to the naming of the new street, but also the renaming of the few remaining houses in Tichborne Street. The latter the Vestry suggest should be now incorporated with Piccadilly. For the new street the Vestry suggested the name of St. James's Avenue, as being specially applicable on account of the thoroughfare leading to the heart of St. James's, and the name thus forming an excellent guide to strangers visiting the west-end from Bloomsbury and the Northern Railway Stations. This suggestion was, however, not adopted, and the Metropolitan Board of Works have given the name of Shaftesbury Avenue to the thoroughfare, in connection with the proposed erection therein of a memorial to the late Earl of Shaftesbury. STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion of 49 the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. The annual charge for this work amounts to about £400. By an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:—Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area being regarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. A considerable further quantity of wood and asphalte paving work has been carried out duriug the past year, and tenders have been accepted for a further quantity of wood and asphalte paving during the ensuing year. Asphalte has proved particularly satisfactory; it is impervious, smooth, and comparatively noiseless, and is especially well adapted to narrow streets and courts. The first cost is somewhat 50 greater than wood, but it is more easily cleansed, and lasts considerably longer without repair. Tenders for the construction of a new sewer in conncction with the Little Pulteney Street improvement were invited by public advertisement, and the tender of Mr. J. Mears was accepted. The work was satisfactorily carried out by him at a cost of .£1,233 10s. 3d. SEWER VENTILATION. This subject has continued to occupy much attention, but it has not been found practicable to adopt any general plan in substitution of the system of open ventilators in the centre of the road. A useful report on the subject has been received from the Metropolitan Board of Works and the Vestry concur generally in the conclusions arrived at thereon, without regarding them as a complete or final solution of the question. The principal recommendations set forth in this Report are to destroy disused sewers; adopt stringent measures for preventing the discharge into sewers of road sweepings, chemical refuse, trade filth, or other improper substances; that effectua provision should be made for the cleansing of sewers b\ flushing or other means, and for this purpose the simultaneous flushing of house drains, in order to increase the volume oj water in the sewers is suggested; the flushing of courts anc alleys; an increase in the number of surface ventilators; the adoption of pipe ventilators carried up the side of buildings: and the deodorisation of sewage. USE OF STEAM ROAD ROLLER. Upon the invitation of the Kensington Vestry, three mem bers were appointed to attend a conference of representative from Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, to conside the use of heavy rollers in the repair of roads, as affected by a 51 judgment of Mr. Justice Field, which was affirmed with some modifications on appeal. The judgment virtually restrains Vestries from using Road Rollers in such a way as to injure pipes or mains properly laid under the surface. The Vestry have discontinued the use of the 15 ton roller altogether, and now use no heavier roller than one of 10 tons. I he increased use of wood and asphalte, moreover, has largely diminished the necessity for a roller of any description. REFUGES. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish:— Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. „ „ by the Athenæum Club. „ ,, by St. James's Palace. „ „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. „ by Burlington House. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly Circus (3 Refuges). Regent Street, by Oxford Circus. „ „ by Argyll Place. ,, „ by Conduit Street. „ „ by Glasshouse Street. „ „ by Air Street. „ „ by the County Fire Office. „ ,, by Jermyn Street. ,, „ by Charles Street. „ „ by the Haymarket. St. James's Street, by King Street. , „ by Pall Mall. Waterloo Place, between the Athenæum and United Service Clubs. It has been arranged to form a refuge at the south end of the Haymarket, at the joint expense of the Vestries of St. Martin and St. James, who will also share the cost of lighting and maintenance. 52 CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways:— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches, thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 143, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent of value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty years since. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorar and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the information should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting in maintaining a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. Where cisterns are in use they should be kept covered and be cleansed at sufficiently frequent intervals; if they are used as receptacles for drinking water they should be disconnected from water closets and drains; care should be taken to keep the drains clean and properly trapped; attention should be paid to the ventilation of dwelling rooms; and no foul accumulation should be permitted to remain in the dust bin. Information and advice on all these subjects, and on any other points relating to the public health or sanitary precautions, may be freely obtained at the Vestry Hall. It cannot be too earnestly urged that the neglect of sanitary measures in a small area, perhaps in a single house, may lead to a serious and widespread epidemic. The Vestry have therefore no hesitation in saying that a timely intimation to their Medical Officer of Health may prevent very serious consequences and actual loss of life. COWSHEDS, DAIRIES, AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are now no cowsheds in the Parish, and only two slaughter houses. The licenses of the latter were renewed in 54 October, the premises having been kept in a satisfactory Condition. Agreeably to the request of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the Vestry's Sanitary Officers have been instructed to note and report any milkshops or dairies which are not registered under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order 1885. The Vestry, however, entertain a strong opinion that it is advisable to transfer the adminstration of this Order and of the Regulations made in pursuance thereof, from the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Local Sanitary Authorities, inasmuch as the latter are already charged with the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, which relate to the quality of the article sold, and of the Acts relating to the Public Health which apply to the condition of the premises. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION FOR NON-PAUPER CASES. The Vestry have accepted, in principle, the form of agreement which the Metropolitan Asylums Board have submitted, for the reception and treatment in the Board's Hospitals of any patients suffering from infectious disease who may be sent on the order of the Medical Officer ofHealth. The persons contemplated by this Agreement are those who are in a position to pay for their own treatment and maintenance, but whose removal to hospital is desirable either for their own comfort or the protection of inmates in the same house or in close proximity thereto. The Vestry conceive it to be the duty of a Sanitary Authority to adopt all practicable precautions against the outbreak or spread of disease, including the isolation or removal of patients where necessary, and they therefore do not share the objection to the agreement which has been raised by some of the local authorities in the Metropolis. 55 METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. The facts elicited at the enquiry by the Local Government Board Inspectors into the management of the Eastern Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board seemed to point to some general laxity of adininstration on the part of the last mentioned. Board. The Vestry, therefore, in common with many other Local Authorities, petitioned Parliament for a more extended enquiry. No action, however, has as yet been taken in this direction. SANITARY REGULATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. It was stated in the last Annual Report that the Vestry were in communication with the Local Government Board on the subject of framing Regulations under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the 47th section of the Sanitary Law Amendment Act, 1874. As the result, the following Regulations were made by the Vestry on the 23rd April, 1885, and confirmed, by the Local Government Board on the 9th May, 1885. INTERPRETATION OF TERMS.

The Vestry will, on application, furnish the owner of every registered house with a card specifying the number of persons permitted to occupy each room in such house, but failure to furnish such card will not relieve the owner or lodger, as the case may be, from any liability to penalties, if the authorised number of occupiers is exceeded. GENERAL LAW. The powers of the Vestry, in the execution of the Nuisances Removal and Sanitary Acts, may be exercised by any Committee appointed for the purpose (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 121, sec. 5). The foregoing Regulations are in addition to the provisions of the various statutes relating to house drainage, construction of dustbins, removal of nuisances, &c., the principal requirements of which are appended. HOUSE DRAINAGE. Houses are to be properly drained into a public sewer. The Vestry may cause the drains, water-closets, and works, or apparatus connected therewith to be inspected from time to time, and put into proper condition at the expense of the owner or occupier of the premises, when necessary (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, secs. 73,74, 75, 82 & 85). Adequate water-closet accommodation, with a suitable water supply, to be provided (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, sec. 81). 61 DUSTBINS AND DUST REMOVAL. The Vestry may require ash-pits or dustbins, furnished with proper doors and coverings, to be provided (18 % 19 Vic., cap, 120, secs. 81 and 250). Persons refusing, or not permitting, dirt, ashes, or filth to be taken away by the scavengers or dustmen, or obstructing the scavengers or dustmen in the performance of their duty, are liable to a penalty of £5 for each offence (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, sec. 126). NUISANCES. The term "Nuisances" iucludes the following:—Premises in such a state as to be a nuisance, or injurious to health; offensive water-closeta, drains, ash-pits, &c. ; an animal so kept as to be a nuisance; an offensive accumulation; a house so overcrowded as to be dangerous, or prejudicial to the health of the inmates (18 and 19 Vic., cap. 121, sec. 8; 29 & 30 Vict., cap. 90, sec. 19). In any cases not affected by the Regulations, the general law relating to the removal of nuisances will apply. SERVICE OF NOTICES. Notices to the Vestry may be served personally on the Vestry Clerk, or left at his office in the Vestry Hall (18 & 19 Vic., cap. 120, sec. 220). Notices under the Nuisances Removal and Sanitary Acts may bo served by delivering the same to the persons to whom they are addressed, or at their residence, or to some person upon the premises to which such notices relate, or by fixing the notice upon some conspicuous part of such premises (18 & 19 Vie., cap. 121, sec. 31). INFORMATION. Information relating to any of the above-mentioned matters may obtained on application at the Vestry Hall. No drainage works or structural alterations, should be commenced until notice thereof has been given to the Surveyor, or Inspector, as the case may be. It may be mentioned that the Vestry have retained under these regulations, a far larger amount of discretionary control than many other authorities have done, being of opinion that those with a local knowledge are best capable of dealing with cases which cannot be met by inelastic regulations. 62 Immediately after the Regulations were confirmed the Sanitary Committee person ally inspected several houses in the Parish, and recommended the Vestry, in the first instance, to register 30 houses. The registration will be extended by degrees, as may appear desirable. HOUSING OF THE POOR. The views of the Vestry on two important points in connection with this subject were brought under the notice of the Royal Commission by the Vestry Clerk in evidence. These points are (1) the necessity of Local Authorities beingvested with compulsory power of purchase, under the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Acts, and the desirability of transferring the administrations of these Acts to the local Sanitary Authority, instead of requiring a separate body of commissioners to be appointed, and (2) the advisability of transferring the duty of reporting the illegal habitation of cellar dwellings from the District Surveyors to the Inspectors of the Local Sanitary Authorities. With regard to the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Acts, the Royal Commissioners suggest that in London the Acts should be made Metropolitan instead of Parochial, and be administered by the Metropolitan Board of Works ; that if necessary for the protection of the ratepayers against an imprudent scheme, a local enquiry might be held before sanction is given to the borrowing of money for the purposes of the Acts; and that compulsory powers to purchase land under the Acts should be given to, the local authority by provisional order. The Vestry entertain some doubt as to the wisdom of making these Acts metropolitan in character, feeling that the local sanitary authorities might from time to time be enabled to put them in operation at a smaller cost, if on a less ambitious scale, and to greater local advantage than a central Board. With this qualification the Vestry were gratified to find that their views were endorsed by the Royal Commissioners. 63 On the second point the Commissioners recommend that the duty of discovering illegally inhabited cellars should be placed in the hands of the inspectors of the local sanitary authority, as suggested by the Vestry. Following upon the Report of the Royal Commission, an Act of Parliament has been passed under the short title of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, by which legislative effect has been given to the recommendations of the Royal Commissioners with respect to the Labouring Classes Lodging Houses Acts. Other provisions of the Act include the repeal of two sections in the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Act (1868) Amendment Act, 1879, by which owners of property condemned under the Act of 18(38 might compel the Local Authority to purchase the same; the amendment of the Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Improvement Acts, 1875 to 1879, the amendment of the law with respect to interest on loans granted by the Public Works Loans Commissioners for the purposes of the Act, the general Sanitary law in one or two minor particulars, and the Settled Land Act, 1882. Power is also given to sanitary authorities to deal with tents, vans, sheds, or similar structures used for human habitation, if the same are overcrowded or otherwise injurious to health, in the same manner as if they were dwelling houses. But probably what will prove one of the most far reaching of the sections of the Act in its bearing on subsequent legislation, is that which holds that in any contract for the letting of houses for habitation by the working classes, there shall be implied a condition that the house is at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. The value of the houses coming within the operation of this scheme in the Metropolis, arc dwelling houses assessed to the poor rate upon an annual value noi exceeding £20. The principle ot this provision is no doubt sound, but it remains to be seen how far it will answer tinexpectations of its framers. Some particulars of the buildings now in course of erection by the Vestry for the labouring poor are given on page 64. 64 DWELLINGS FOR THE LABOURING POOR. Considerable progress has been made in carrying out the scheme for devoting the balance of the purchase money of the St. James's Burial Ground to the erection of a block of dwellings for the labouring poor, to which reference was made in the last Annual Report. The Vestry have taken a plot of ground at the corner of Ingestre Place and Silver Place on a building lease for 63 years from the 24th June, 1885, at a ground rent of one penny for the first year, and £50 per annum for the remainder of the term. The rent originally proposed was £75 per annum, but on representations being made to Sir R. F. Sutton, the freeholder of the ground, he very kindly reduced the amount to £50, at the same time stating that he could not injustice to his other tenants extend the term as desired by the Vestry. In addition to the balance of the purchase money of the Burial Ground, the Vestry have accepted an assignment of the lease of No. 7 Ingestre Place, and the accumulated surplus receipts in respect of the rents derivable therefrom. This property has hitherto been under the management of a body of private trustees, and it is anticipated that the amalgamation of the two projects under a public body will be an advantage to both, by developing the scheme more rapidly than would otherwise have been the case. The Vestry have also a sum of nearly £80, the surplus of a fund raised some years since to relieve the sufferers by a fire in Little Windmill Street, to be applied in aid of the scheme for the dwellings. Upon the petition of the Vestry and the various other parties interested, an Order was made by Mr. Justice Pearson on the 3rd August, 1885, authorising and directing the several before-mentioned moneys to be applied to the erection of the proposed dwellings in Ingestre Place, the nature of the 65 trust being set forth in a schedule to the order of the Court as follows:— 1. The funds are to be applied by the Vestry of the parish of St. James Westminster (hereinafter called the Vestry) In or towards the erection and fitting up on the land comprised in the Agreement dated the 18th May, 1885, and made between Sir Richard Francis Sutton of the first part and the Vestry ofthe Parish of St. James Westminster in the county of Middlesex of the second part of a lodging house or lodging houses to be used together with the leasehold messuage and premises No. 7 Ingestre Place for the accommodation at moderate rents of female pieceworkers and others of the labouring classes 2. Such lodging house or lodging houses and the premises No. 7 Ingestre Place are to be vested in the Vestry and to be under the control and management of the Vestry or a Committee appointed by them A proper declaration or declarations of Trust of the premises comprised in the said Agreement for lease and of No. 7 Ingestre Place shall be executed by the Vestry and enrolled pursuant to the Acts of George 2nd chapter 36 and 24 Victoria Chapter 9 3. Any surplus income of the said properties after providing for repairs and other outgoings and expenses of management shall be invested in the name or names of the Vestry or of Trustees to be appointed by the Vestry and applied in such manner as the Vestry with the approval of the Charity Commisioners for England and Wales or a court of competent jurisdiction shall hereafter determine either in perpetuating and extending the operations of the scheme or for other purposes in or for the benefit of the said parish. In order to avoid loss of time, the Vestry invited four Architects to submit designs, while the matter was under the consideration of the Court. The instructions to the architects were revised by George Godwin, Esq, F.R.S., to whom the Vestry are also indebted for many valuable suggestions during the progress of the matter. 1 he selected architects, who were chosen in consequence of their special knowledge of sanitation and the requirements of Artisans Dwellings were Mr. H. II. Collins, of 61, Old Broad Street. Mr. H. M. Eyton, of Ipswich. Mr. E. C. Robins, of 14, John Street, Adelphi. Mr. Ernest Turner, of 246, Regent Street. 66 Each of these gentlemen was good enough to submit a set of drawings. No premium was offered, but a stipulation was made that if any of the designs was selected by the Vestry the author thereof should be appointed architect to carry out the work at the usual rate of remuneration. The drawings were submitted to J.T. Wimperis Esq. and D. Cubitt Nichols Esq., who generously undertook the office of honorary professional advisers to the Vestry. These gentlemen awarded the place of honour to the design of Mr. Collins, as best fulfilling the conditions and meeting the requirements of the Vestry, and the Special Committee of the Vestry concurring in this view, Mr. Collins's designs were adopted, subject to one or two minor alterations in detail. Mr. Collins was appointed Architect in accordance with the understanding upon which designs were invited, and a very hearty vote of thanks was accorded to each of the other three gentlemen in recognition of the public spirit which prompted them to submit designs to the Vestry. A Quantity Surveyor has been appointed, and a number of firms have been invited to tender for carrying out the work. INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES. The Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, having transferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses, is given for the information of parishioners:— 1. A bakehouse, to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements:— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. 67 (5) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be in injurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or vari:i«lied, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished, and partly limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap once at least in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may bo employed in a house contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of au infringement of the law, and bakehouses brought into use after the 31st May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (33 in number) are under frequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vetsry. It has not been found necessary to take proceedings again the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year, but two bakehouses, each kept by a foreigner, have required almost constant attention from the Sanitary Officers. One of these bakehouses has now been given up. 68 WATER SUPPLY. Some important questions have been raised during the year affecting the relative positions of the Water Companies and the consumers. A Bill (The Waterworks Clauses Act [1847] Amendment Bill) promoted by Mr. W. M. Torrens,M.P., providing that the rateable value of premises shall betaken as the annual value, in all cases, as the basis of charge for a domestic supply has become law, but this Act will probably not benefit the residents in a highly-rented parish like St. James's to the slightest extent, indeed, it has, in some instances, led to an increase in the annual charge. Should, however, the question of purchasing the undertakings of the Metropolitan Water Companies again come to the front, the limitation of the power of the Companies in the matter of assessment must necessarily prevent any demand on the part of the Companies for a hypothetical increase represented by an undetermined basis of annual value. A far more important measure, in the judgment of the Vestry, was introduced into the House of Lords, but failed to pass. This was a Bill for regulating the powers of the Water Companies, and was introduced by Lord Carnperdown. Amongst other provisions the Bill proposed to considerably restrict the power of Water Companies to discontinue a supply. This question is exceedingly important from a sanitary point of view, for it is evident that absence of water in a crowded tenement house in sultry weather, might lead to an outbreak of epidemic disease, extending far beyond the source of origin. A large, and it is believed rapidly increasing, number of houses in St. James's are wholly let out in lodgings, the landlord residing away. In such cases, the rates, including water rates, are payable by the landlord, and instances have arisen more than once, where through no fault of the tenants, the water supply has been discontinued in consequence of the neglect of the 69 landlord to pay the company. Under these circumstances, the only remedy which the Vestry can take is to commence proceedings under the Nuisances Removal Act, an inhabited house unprovided with water usually being ipso facto in such a state as to be injurious to health. It seemed to the Vestry, however, that Lord Camperdown's Bill, which was referred to a Select Committee, afforded a convenient opportunity of providing a more complete and summary remedy, and they accordingly suggested that a clause should be inserted empowering occupiers to pay the rates, where payable by the landlord, in case of default, and to deduct the amount so paid from any rent due or becoming due. The Vestry were gratified to learn that this clause was adopted by the Committee, although they regret the Bill did not become law. The principle, however, has thus been agreed to by a Committee of the House of Lords, and will probably be incorporated in any future legislation dealing with the subject. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspector and submitted to the Public Analyst, appointed by the Vestry, during the year:— Coffee 32 Milk 13 45 Of these samples, 32 were found to be free from adulteration, and 13 to be more or less admixed with foreign ingredients. The poorest sample of milk contained no less than 29 per cent. of added water, and the worst sample of coffee contained 30 per cent. of chicory. Proceedings were taken in nine cases, in each of which a conviction obtained. 70 The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year, in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, is as follows:— £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of samples, &c 8 6 75 8 6 Fines recovered 7 0 0 Net cost to the Parish 68 8 6 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out for the following offences:— Adulteration 9 Unsanitary condition of premises 4 Offence under Sanitary Regulations 1 Obstructions 4 Standing vehicles in public places 10 Erecting hoard without license 1 Non-payment of cost of reinstating pavement, &c. 5 Defective coal plates 1 Total 35 The Vestry succeeded in all these cases: fines were inflicted in 13 cases; orders were made for the execution of works in 16; claims were paid before the hearing of the summonses in 4 cases; and the necessary works were executed in 2 cases. None of the proceedings call for any special comment. DISORDERLY HOUSES. As usual, several complaints have been received of house, alleged to be used for immoral purposes, but owing to the necessity of two householders being joined in the prosecution, proceedings have only been taken in two cases. One of these 71 was carried to a successful issue, fines being inflicted to the amount of £125. The other case, which had long been under observation, was taken under the Criminal Law Amendment Act of last session, but the prosecution was rendered abortive in consequence of the offender becoming incapable of pleading. The Vestry regarded with some satisfaction the passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, in support of which thev had petitioned more than once. The clause relating to the summary prosecution of brothel keepers, however, was weakened by the addition of an ambiguous provision which appears to render the proceedings subject to the formality of the old law.* It may be remarked that by joining in the prosecution a householder incurs no pecuniary liability, and in the great majority of cases need not give evidence at the Sessions. Still it is useless to deny that many people entertain some objection to being associated in any manner with proceedings of the kind, and the Vestry therefore hope that at no distant date, Parliament will confer upon Local Authorities power to prosecute in such cases. As a safeguard against the possibility of a Local Authority neglecting this duty, concurrent power might be reserved to two householders as at present. As one instance of the necessity of some reform in the procedure, it may be mentioned that the Vestry Clerk was in possession of abundant evidence to justify proceedings against the keeper of certain premises which subsequently became notorious in what was known as the Armstrong Abduction case, but owing to the reluctance ot the neighbouring householders to lay an information, no action was taken. If the Vestry Clerk, or some other officer, could initiate proceedings in his public capacity, without requiring • In a recent judgment in the Queen's Bench Division, it was held that the old form of procedure does not apply to summary prosecutions under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885 (Kerwin v. Hines, 50 J.P., 212) proceedings by way of indictment continue subject to the former practice. 72 to be set in motion by two householders, considerable advance might be made in the suppression of disorderly houses. URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals erected and maintained by the Vestry:— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments. Blenheim Street 4 King's Arms Yard 3 Broad Street 8 Mason's Yard 3 Coach and Horses Yard 4 Vine Street 7 Cork Mews 2 Wells Street 5 Ham Yard 3 With a view to supplying in some degree the need of further accommodation, the Vestry have asked the Metropolitan Board of Works to allow them to erect a public urinal and other conveniences on the vacant ground at Piccadilly Circus. This ground is scarcely suitable for ordinary building purposes, but might well be utilized as a small ornamental space, with possibly a fountain or statue in the centre. If some such idea were carried out, it would not be difficult to form an underground urinal, provided with proper approaches. This suggestion was brought under the notice of the Board by a deputation from the Vestry, on the 13th July, Mr. Burgess, Chairman of the Works Committee, speaking on behalf of the deputation, but no definite reply has yet been received from the Board. The Vestry had intended erecting a small urinal at the entrance to Wardour Mews, in order to abate a nuisance, but the owners of adjacent property objecting to the proposal, the nuisance continues. A wooden structure was erected in Bridle Lane by way of experiment, to ascertain how far a public urinal at that spot 73 would serve to abate a nuisance of which many complaints had been made, and from the free use to which this structure was put, it was clear that a public want had been supplied The Vestry accordingly determined to erect an iron urinal in place of the temporary structure, but were met with some opposition Eventually the opposition was withdrawn upon the Vestry agreeing to remove the urinal if the freeholders of the contiguous property, or their lessees, require to utilize a blocked-up doorway, near which it is proposed to fix the urinal, or to convert the return frontage of the premises into a shop front A suitable urinal has accordingly been ordered and will shortly be placed in position The cost of maintaining the urinals during the year is as follows:— £ s , d Water for flushing 302 12 9 Wages for cleansing 62 8 0 £365 0 9 CAB RANKS The following is a list of the Cab Hanks in this parish authorised by the Commissioner of Police:— No of Places 12 Broad Street Haymarket (two Standings) 32 Piccadilly 11 Recent Street 3 10 St James's Square St James's Street (two Standings) Waterloo Place The only rank which has a Cabmen's Shelter is that in St James's Square The shelter was provided and is maintained at private expense 74 PILLAR LETTER BOXES With the assent of the Vestry, pillar letter boxes have been erected by the Postmaster-General in the under-inentioned thoroughfares:— Western District Albany Beak Street Brewer Street Burlington Gardens Coventry Street Golden Square Great Marlborough Street New Burlington Street Piccadilly, by the Egyptian Hall Regent Street, by Piccadilly Circus Regent Street, Quadrant Sackville Street South-western District Haymarket, by Jermyn Street Duke Street, by Ryder Street Jermyn Street, by St James's Church Pall Mall, by the War Office Pall Mall, by Waterloo Place Park Place St James's Square, by Charles Street Two of these pillar boxes (those in Brewer Street and Duke Street) have been erected during the past year The Vestry have suggested that for the convenience of visitors to the Metropolis, street lamps near pillar letter boxes should have some distinguishing mark, such as a piece of red glass in the upper part of the lantern, and this suggestion is now under consideration by the Postmaster-General FIXED POINTS The following list of fixed points where a constable may be found at all times, is given for the information of Parishioners:— 75 Marlborough House, Pall Mall Oxford Circus Piccadilly Regent Street, by Beak Street, St James's Street (south end) FIRE BRIGADE There is only one Fire Brigade Station in the Parish, viz at 99, King Street, Regent Street (near Argyll Place), but other stations in adjoining Parishes are available in cases of an outbreak of fire The stations nearest this Parish are situate at No 171, Great Portland Street, Oxford Street; 33, King Street, Portman Square; George Yard, Crown Street, Soho; and 44, Chandos Street, Covent Garden Fire alarms in telegraphic communication with Fire Brigade Stations, have been erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the undermentioned thoroughfares:— Golden Square Piccadilly, by St James's Church Pall Mall, by Marlborough House Fire escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly MUSIC AND DANCING LICENSES In accordance with the Standing Orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions, notices were given to the vestry in the month of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licenses, as follows:— Bignell, Robert Richard, The Trocadero, 7 and 8, Great Windmill Street, for Music only Brigham, Margaret, 6, Swallow Street, for Music only Highton, Theodore Arthur, Piccadilly Art Galleries, for Music and Dancing Leslie, George, St James's Hall, Piccadilly, and Regent Street, for Music aud Dancing 76 Mitchell,

Court of Quarter Sessions in each case PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES —SESSION 1886 The only private Bill relating to this Parish was that promoted by the West London Electric Lighting Company, which is noticed on page 45 BILLS IN PARLIAMENT Among the Bills that have received attention during the year are the following:— Session 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Local Authorities (Expenses of Conferences ) Lunacy Acts Amendment Metropolis Management Acts Amendment Parliamentary Elections (Redistribution) Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sunday Sites for Places of Religious Worship Telegraph Acts Amendment Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Session 1886 Beer Adulteration Church Boards Compensation for Dimages Common Juries Remuneration 77 Employers' Liability Act (1880) Amendment Explosive Substances Act, 1883, Amendment Hampstead Heath Enlargement Metropolitan Board of Works (Fire Brigade Expenses) Metropolitan Board of Works (Theatres, Ac ) Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Metropolitan Board of Works (Water Supply, Ac ) Parliamentary Franchise (Extension to Women) Parliamentary Voters (Registration) Private Bill Legislation Shop Hours Regulation Theatres, &c , Metropolis The Vestry again petitioned in favour of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, and against the Theatres, &c (Metropolis) Bill With regard to the Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Bill, the Vestry suggested that advantage should be taken of the opportunity which appeared to present itself by the proposed formation of an approach from the Charing Cross footbridge to the Victoria Embankment, for the restoration of an approach to the bridge on a level with the Strand, as formerly existed before the property was acquired by the Railway Company The Board, however, expressed their inability to adopt the suggestion, inasmuch as the necessary notices had not been given The Vestry expressed themselves as approving generally the Bills promoted by the Metropolitan Board of works lor the inspection of Theatres, for powers to protect the interests of the water consumers, and for various powers, and opposed to the Parliamentary Voters (Registration) Bill The action taken in respect of the Parliamentary Elections (Redistribution) Bill is noticed below, and the Hampstead Heath Enlargement Bill on page 91 REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS BILL Under the (Redistribution) Parliamentary Elections Bill, as introduced into the House of Commons, it was proposed to 78 divide the ancient and historic Borough of the City and Liberties of Westminster into three boroughs As stated in the Vestry's Report for last year, representations were made to the Government in favour of the retention of the ancient name, and of assigning an additional member to the Borough The Government assented to both these proposals and the Bill was amended accordingly, but some dissatisfaction was expressed by the inhabitants of the east end of London in consequence of the additional seat which it was proposed to give to Westminster being taken from the Tower Hamlets The manner in which the Boundary Commissioners proposed to divide the Borough of Westminster moreover, did not commend itself to any of the Local Authorities who considered the matter, and upon an Amendment to the Bill being proposed in the House of Lords, having for its object the division of Westminster intot hree distinct boroughs, and the representation of Tower Hamlets maintained as originally proposed, the Government accepted the amendment The Borough of the City and Liberties of Westminster has consequently ceased to exist, and the area thus formerly described is now divided into three distinct boroughs, viz , Westminster, comprising the Parishes of St Margaret and St John; St George, Hanover Square, comprising the Parish of that name; and Strand, comprising the Parishes of St James, St Martin, and the district of the Strand as defined by the Metropolis Local Management Act, except the Liberty of the Rolls As a matter of information the names of the first members elected to represent the new Boroughs in Parliament are appended viz Westminster—W Burdett Coutts Esq , (Conservative) St George, Hanover Square—Lord Algernon Percy (Conservative) Strand—Rt Hon W H Smith (Conservative) 79 LOCAL GOVERNMENT OF LONDON This subject has continued to engage the attention of the Vestry Upon the invitation of the Westminster District Board of Works, the Vestry appointed representatives to attend a Conference at Westminster Town Hall, which was convened for the purpose of considering the desirability of memorializing Her Majesty's Government to cause enquiry to be made by a Royal Commission into the whole question of the Local Government of the Metropolis The Conference was held on the 19th October, Mr J K Aston presiding, and the majority of the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis being represented A memorial to the Government in favour of an enquiry as a preliminary measure to legislation was adopted The Vestry fully concur in the desirability of some such enquiry, for they believe that this would lead to a better appreciation of the value of the work performed by the various local authorities since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act in 1885, and at the same time show in what respects the system of local government in the Metropolis needs reform The introduction of the changes under the Act of 1855 was preceded by an enquiry by a Royal Commission in 1853, and in view ot the mass of legislation affecting the Metropolis which has been added to the Statute Book in the meantime, aud the alterations which the Metropolis has in so many respects undergone, a similar enquiry at the present time could not but be attended by advantage It is, perhaps, needless to remark that the evidence taken by the Royal Commission of 1853 is scarcely applicable to existing circumstances Three members of the Vestry have been appointed to join a deputation to the Home Secretary in support of this memorial In the month of November the Vestry received from the Corporation of the City of London, a copy of a scheme which 60 had been prepared by a Special Committee of the Court of Common Council, for the Municipal Government of London, with a request that the Vestry would express their opinion thereon Under the scheme of the Corporation Committee it was proposed to create Ten Municipalities for the Metropolis, corresponding in area with the parliamentary boroughs as they existed prior to the Redistribution of Seats Act in 1885, with one central organization composed of representatives from each Municipality In order to meet expenses not properly chargeable upon the Borough Kate, a sum of <£4,000 per annum would bo paid out of the City cash to each of the Corporations These proposals did not appear to be in accord with the resolution passed by the Vestry with regard to the London Government Bill, on the 14th May, 1884, consequently the Vestry did not feel able to endorse the principles of the scheme On the contrary, a resolution was passed re-affirming the opinion of the Vestry that it is desirable to extend Municipal Government to the Metropolis at large by a measure that shall embrace the duties, powers and privileges of the City Corporation and the Metropolitan Board of Works, and that in any such Scheme provision shall be made for simplifying and unifying the system of local management in the various districts of London by the abolition of obsolete, conflicting, and overlapping bodies, and for the administration of all local affairs on the same lines throughout the Metropolis by one elected local authority in each unit of administration, such authorities to possess precisely similar functions and powers, and to have the initiative in all such local matters as fall within the defined scope of their operations The subject of the local management of the Metropolis is far more complex than many people imagine In order to effect genuine reform in the Local Government of Loudon it appears necessary to keep in view two distinct aims, viz:— The creation of one strong representative body to deal with 81 questions affecting the Metropolis as a whole (such bridges, markets, fire brigade, main drainage, Metropolitan improvements, and speaking broadly, the powers of the Court of Common Council and the Metropolitan Board of Works, and possibly the Schools of the Corporation and the School Board), and the consolidation and unification of the powers of local bodies administering purely local matters (such as paving, lighting, drainage, sanitation, vaccination, poor-law relief, administration of local endowed charities, &c ), in the district selected as the unit of Local (as distinct from Metropolitan) Government Owing to local legislation, and the piecemeal manner in which local Acts have been dealt with by general legislation, many unnecessary Boards exist in various parishes In St James's, for instance, the remaining duties of the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor might, without difficulty be performed by the Vestry In the Metropolis, moreover, Overseers of the Poor are mostly without power in parishes comprised in Schedule A of the Metropolis Local Management Act Again, in Parishes in Union, the Assessment Committee is appointed by the Guardians of the Poor; while in other parishes it, is appointed by the Vestry Thus, in one parish the assessment of property comes under the cognizance of the Poor Law Authority, while in the next it may be thrown upon the authority created by the Metropolis Local Management Act An extraordinary diversity in practice exists with regard to the collection of rates In St James's the rates are made and collected by the Vestry In some parishes they are made and collected by the Overseers In yet others (as Kensington, and St Martin-in-the-Fields), they are made by the vestry and collected by another board And in still others, like Chelsea, they are made and collected by the Guardians of the Poor A like diversity exists in the mode of appointing rate collectors; for while in some parishes they are appointed by one authority to collect all the parochial rates, in othters 82 (St Anne for example), the Guardians appoint the collector of poor rates, while the Overseers (an unincorporate body), appoint the collector of the local management rates The inconvenience and useless additional expense arising from a duplication of rate collectors, is too obvious to need comment Another objection to the existing system of Local Government, is the overlapping of areas The area of the Metropolis itself differs for various purposes: thus the Metropolis under the Metropolitan Board of Works differs from that of the Post Office, which differs again from that of the Police Commissioners, and all differ from the London of the Registrar General The parish is taken as the unit for some purposes, the district for others, and the poor law union for others At present, moreover, no two Local Boards in any parish are elected in precisely the same way; Guardians are elected by plurality of votes (noncumulative), under a system of voting papers Vestrymen are elected by single votes under the ballot, and members of other Local Boards are usually elected indirectly The scheme proposed by the Corporation of the City of London appeared to be open to some of the objections entertained to the London Government Bill, inasmuch as it would result in the creation of ten municipalities with one central organization, while no attempt was made to redress the evils most needing reform Besides which, the ten municipalities would probably be overshadowed by the central authority From a consideration of the foregoing observations it will be apparent that any scheme promising real reform in the local government of London will require the exercise of no ordinary amount of statesmanship, combined with a knowledge of the subject, and an attention to detail which few men will be disposed to bring to bear upon a subject so prosaic in character It is essential that a question so far-reaching, and so important to the health and the pockets of the millions of residents in London, should not be permitted to 88 form a topic of contention between rival political parties and the Vestry, therefore, once more express their hope that any Bill which may be introduced into Parliament will be the outcome of an impartial and exhaustive preliminary enquiry OVERHEAD WIRES The Select Committee appointed by the House of Commons to consider the law relating to the control over Telephone Telegraph, and other Wires, after hearing several witnesses, agreed upon a report, but no legislation has yet resulted In the meantime the number of overhead wires is continually increasing, and local authorities are left without any power of inspection or general control Among other recommendations, the Committee suggest that the Postmaster-General should have a discretionary power to give notice of his intention to erect any telegraphic wire before, instead of after, obtaining the consent of the road authority, an opportunity being afforded to objecting parties to state their views to a competent tribunal, such as a county Court Judge, with power of appeal to the Railway Commissioners, as at present In St James's nearly all the poet office lines are underground, the vast majority ot the overhead wires belonging to a Telephone Company or to private owners, and being erected without statutory authority or control As the law now stands the local authority has no power to remove these unauthorised wires, which if abandoned may become a fruitful source of danger The Select committee propose that the licenses of the Post Office, such as owners or renters of telephone wires, should be placed under the same restrictions as the Postmaster-general, and submit a series of further suggestions as follows:— Bye-laws for the regulation of all wires, as to substance, length of span, durability, and other matters, and for their identification and inspection should be male for the whole of London by the 84 Metropolitan Board of works subject to the sanction of the Board of Trade In London, the enforcement of these byelaws should be entrusted to the Corporation of the City and to the Vestries and District Boards For the protection of the public it is necessary that there should be a ready means of dealing with every wire For this purpose every wire should be identified, and the bye-law should provide for the best method of identification, by registration or otherwise, and for the removal of all ownerless wires The Vestry agree in the main with these proposals, although they fear that the conclusions of the Committee will prove inadequate to thoroughly deal with a subject in which the rights of private owners, the convenience of those who use the Telephone System and the safety of the public, are so interwoven The Vestry, however, hope that some Bill applying both to existing wires and those hereafter to be erected may yet become law, before the necessity of some control is painfully forced upon the public by an alarming accident While care must be taken on the one hand not to unduly interfere with the development of so great a public convenience as the Telephone, still considerations of public safety demand that these wires should be placed under some sort of control The necessity for immediate action has been emphasized by the enormous amount of damage done to overhead wires by the snowstorm of January 6th, and the numerous narrow escapes from peril arising therefrom A curious anomaly in the law has also forced itself on the attention of the Vestry during the year, by the erection of overhead wires for the purpose of supplying electricity by the Grosvenor Gallery Electric Lighting Company The Electric Lighting Act, 1882, expressly prohibits the erection of overhead wires by "undertakers" without the sanction of the Local Authority; that is to say, any company, firm, or individual, obtaining a provisional order, or license, is preciuded from stretching wires across streets without consent The company in question, however, are not working under either a provisional order or license, and the Electric lighting Act 85 therefore does not apply to them The consequence apparently is, to place duly authorised undertakings under restrictions which those who are able to dispense with an order or a license may avoid The Vestry have called the attention of the Board of Trade to this anomalous state of affairs, and suggested that the law should be amended so an to prohibit the erection of unauthorised wires under any circumstances A reply has been received from the Board of Trade to the effect that a note has been made of the observations of the Vestry, which will be duly considered Representations have also been made to the Local Government Board on the subject SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON The following extracts from the Report of the Special Committee appointed on the 12th February, 1885, to which reference was made in the last Annual Report of the Vestry, give an account of the action taken by the Vestry in this matter, and the result thereof— In the first instance, your Committee directed their attention to collating information illustrating the growth of the expenditure of the Board, not only in the aggregate, but per head for each scholar educated in the Board Schools A series of three papers was prepared, and a copy of each supplied to every member of a Vestry or District Board in the Metropolis The Vestry then invited the several Vestries and District Boards (the rating authorities under the Elementary Education Act) to appoint representatives to attend a Conference for the purpose of considering the action to be taken for checking the growing expenditure of the Board By the kindness of the Lord Major, this meeting was held in the Mansion House the city of London, on the 27th April Your Committee regret that in the interval between arranging and holding the meeting, the Lord Mayor ( Alderman Nottage) unfortunately died, his successor (Sir R N Fowler) however took up the engagement of his lamented predecessor, and presided at the opening of the meeting, although he vacated the chair at an early stage, and was followed by the Right Hon W H smith, M P 86 At the request of the Vestry, the Right Hon W H Smith (who had previously afforded your Committee much valuable aid) consented to introduce the subject at the Conference, and to move the first resolution, It may be convenient to append here a copy of the resolutions passed at this conference, which run as follows:— 1 —Moved by the Eight Hon W H Smith, M P , seconded by John Bonthron, Esq , and Resolved, That in the opinion of this Conference the administration of the School Board for London has not produced results commensurate with the vast expenditure of the Board; that the present cost of maintenance of the London Board Schools is excessive, whether compared with the rate of expenditure by the Board in 1873, or with the expenditure of other Boards in England and Wales, or with the expenditure of the Managers of Voluntary Schools in London; that in the cost of administration and some other respects, the expenditure of the Board will admit of large reductions without impeding the work of popular elementary Education in the Metropolis; and that the Board be urged to reduce its expenditure accordingly 2 —Moved by W McCullaoh Torrens, Esq , M P , seconded by the Rev D Greatorex, B D , and Resolved, That the various Rating Authorities in the Metropolis be invited to call the attention of the Ratepayers in their several Districts, in such manner as they may deem best, to the facts referred to in the foregoing resolution, and to the paramount necessity of securing and supporting at the forthcoming Election of the School Board, candidates of administrative ability pledged to carry out the provisions of the Elementary Education Acts with a due regard to economy 3 —Moved by John Stephenson, Esq , seconded by E Spring, Esq , and Resolved, That the Chairman be requested to sign on behalf of this Conference a Petition to the House of Commons, for the appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into the expenditure of the School Board for London 4 — Moved by W A Lindsay, Esq , seconded, and Resolved, That the several Vestries and District Boards of Works in the Metropolis be also requested to petition for the appointment of a Select Committee by the house of Commons to enquire into the expenditure of the School Board for London 87 The proceedings at the conference were virtually unanimous, and it was gratifying to your Committee to find that the speakers, generally, followed on the lines laid down by the Vestry in their published statements, viz , a determination to continue the important work of Education in the spirit of the Elementaly Education Acts, while condemning the unnecessarily lavish expenditure of the Board In pursuance of the first of the resolutions passed at the Mansion House Conference, your Committee then turned their attention to the best meant of arousing public feeling, and directing public opinion, in the Parish of St James A summary of the papers issued in view of the Mansion House Conference was prepared in pamphlet form, with some additional particulars, and a copy thereof placed in the hands of every resident ratepayer Your Committee cannot refrain from expressing their extreme gratification at the fact that the whole of the facts and figures issued under the authority of the Vestry on the subject of the School Board administration and expenditure, have withstood all criticism on the score of accuracy The compilation of these various papers involved a comparison and digest of a multitude of official documents, and a mass of figures, and your Committee deem it only right to say that they are indebted to the Vestry Clerk (Mr H Wilkins) for the assistance he afforded them in arranging the details in a clear and concise manner It is apparent that isolated action in one parish would have little result in effecting any change in the constitution or policy of the Board and your Committee, therefore, determined to invite every member of the various Rating Authorities in Westminster, irrespective of creed or party, to attend a meeting for the purpose of discussing what united action might he usefully taken in view of the election then impending The St James Vestry) Hall not being large enough for the purpose, and it appearing, moreover, that a building in so central a position as the Town hall in Caxton-street and so suitable in other respects, would bo most appropriate for a meeting of the members of the Rating Authorities in the whole electoral Division of Westminster, your Committee asked the Westminster District Board of works permit the proposed meeting to be held in the Town Hall A ready assent was given to this proposal, and the first meeting of members of the Rating Authorities waa accordingly held on the 29th September, T J white, Esq , member of the Metropolitan Board of Works, presiding At this meeting resolutions were passed affirming the necessity of securing the return of candidates prepared to inaugurate and to support the reforms urgently needed in the administration and expenditure of the School Board; inviting all candidates for the westminster Division to attend an adjourned meeting of the Conference for the purpose of furnishing information as to the principles upon which they would proceed if elected; appointing local committees to support approved candidates in the various districts; and opening a subscription list to meet the necessary expenses of carrying on the movement 88 Advertisements were then inserted in all the London daily papers, and in all the local newspapers circulating in Westminster, announcing the adjourned meeting of the Conference, and inviting all intending candidates to attend In addition to this, the Vestry Clerk of St James's, who acted as honorary secretary to the Conference, specially invited all known or suggested candidates to attend the meeting, so that every possible step was taken, not only to secure a representative meeting, but to ascertain the views of all candidate# intending to present themselves to the electors The second meeting of the Westminster Conference was held on the 6th October when several intending candidates addressed the meeting Eleven names were put to the vote, and the choice of the meeting fell on Messrs Burroughes and Ross, two of the sitting members of the board, the Rev W M Sinclair, Vicar of St Stephen's, Westminster, Mr Clifford Probyn, a member of the Vestries of St George, Hanover Square, and St Martin-in-the Fields, and Mr William Winnett, a member of the St James's Vestry, and Chairman of this Committee A Central Executive Committee was appointed to promote the return of the five approved candidates, and although the further progress of the movement is beyond the scope of any reference to your Committee, it is within the knowledge of the Committee that meetings were arranged and held in every part of the Division, at which the five Candidates were present The result of the election has already been published, but your Committee think that the following statement, which illustrates in a remarkable degree the operation of the cumulative vote, is worthy of careful consideration No of Voters No of Votes Sinclair, Rev W M 4568 7145 Ross, James , 4558 6546 Probyn, Clifford 4,167 5616 Burroughes, J S 4026 4894 Winnett, William 3710 4359 Spink, H B 2342 8310 Hoare, H E 1072 3221 Hutchinson, J H 530 1349 While regretting that Mr Winnett failed to obtain a seat, your Committee consider it a matter of congratulation that four of the candidates selected by the representatives of the ratepayers were returned, and that the other elected candidate holds somewhat similar views with regard to the economical administration of the Board as his colleagues Only one candidate supporting the policy of the majority of the late Board (Mr Hoare) presented himself to the Electors, and he was rejected by a decisive majority At the same time it is a matter of deep regret to your Committee, that in spite of all the efforts that have been made, and in spite of exceptionally favourable weather on the day of election, only 8,708 voters of Westminster attended the poll, or only 638 more than in 1882, leaving the large number of about 25,300 abstentions 89 The efforts of your Committee have not been confined exclusively to the Westminster Division, for towards the clo»e of September they suggested an aggregate meeting of all the members of the various rating authorities in, their respective divisions Your committee, however, regret that this suggestion was not acted upon to any very great extent in other districts But it is gratifying to find that the policy recommended by your Committee has been very fully endorsed by public opinion, as expressed at the polling booths The fact that a majority of the new Board are pledged to the principles laid down in the printed documents issued by the Vestry is a sufficient justification of the course adopted by the Committee There is little to add to the foregoing report it may, however, bestated that the Right Hon W H Smith, M P , in presenting the petition of the Vestry to the House of Commons, for the appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into the expenditure of the School Board, gate notice of his intention to move the appointment of such a CommitteeNo doubt this motion would have received the support of the Metropolitan members generally, but before it could be discussed the Ministry resigned, and the whole of the remainder of the session, after the acceptance of office by their successors being required for the transaction of necessary business, the notice of motion fell through It is hoped that the change in the constitution of the Board at the elections last November will obviate the necessity of appointing a Select Committee, but should occasion again appear to require it, the Vestry will renew their application to Parliament The Vestry have had under consideration the system of voting for members of the School Hoard, and in July in july last suggested to the Education Department the desirability of the electoral divisions for School Board purposes being altered so as to correspond with the new parliamentary boroughs To this communication a reply was received stating that the subject would receive consideration, but that it was then too late to make any alteration in the law in the then present session, even if it were desirable After the Election the Vestry again called the attention of the Education Department to the operation of the 90 lative system of voting, and to the desirability of assimilating the mode of voting for the various local boards At present Vestrymen are elected by ballot and a system of single votes, Guardians of the Poor by voting papers and plurality of votes, which, however, are not cumulative, and members of the School Board by ballot and cumulative votes The Vestry see no valid reason for maintaining this state of confusion, and accordingly expressed a hope that the Department would see their way either to abolishing or materially modifying the existing method of voting at School Board Elections, so that the procedure at these elections may, at any rate, in some degree approximate to the procedure at other local elections The Department again replied that the representations of the Vestry should receive careful consideration In order to support their views the Vestry invited the co-operation of other local authorities in their representations to the Education Department Upon the invitation of the St Giles's District Board of Works, the Vestry deputed three of their members to attend a meeting called by that Board, and a report subsequently received from the St Giles's District Board showed that their views were in complete accord with those of the Vestry GATES AND BARS IN STREETS Although the obstruction caused by the existence of gates and bars in many thoroughfares of the Metropolis does not directly affect this Parish, the Vestry, in view of the public inconvenience frequently arising therefrom, concurred in the views expressed by some other local authorities regretting the withdrawal by the Metropolitan Board of Works of the clauses in their Various Powers Bill, of Session 1885, which provided for the abolition ot such obstructions at the joint expense of the Metropolis and the locality concerned The Board, however, did not revive the clauses referred to, and the gates and bars remain undisturbed 91 HAMPSTEAD HEATH EXTENSION Several communications have been received respecting a proposal to purchase the Parliament Hill Estate and some land adjoining, for the purpose of extending the area of Hampstead Heath, and a Bill has been introduced into Parliament with a view to carrying the proposal into effect One clause in the Bill would authorise certain constituted authorities, including the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, to contribute towards the expenses of purchasing the land required, and as the power of contribution is optional and not compulsory, the Vestry did not think it necessary to move in the matter The view entertained by the Vestry with regard to any extension of the Heath is opposed to the cost being thrown upon the rates of the Metropolis at large, and in favour of the imposition of a special rate upon the localities specially benefited, on the principle adopted in the case of Wandsworth Wimbledon, and Putney and Barnes Commons RIOTOUS DISTURBANCES The destruction of property by a mob of disorderly persons on the 8th February, and the paralysis of business resulting from the scare which followed from the inaction ol the police on the occasion, naturally engaged the attention of the vestry A special meeting was held on the 15th February tor the purpose of considering the action to be adopted under the circumstances, and a deputation was then appointed to represent to the Home Secretary the views of the vestry In the absence of the Right Hon W H Smith from London Lord Algernon Percy kindly introduced the deputation to the Home Secretary on the 16th February A deputation of West-End tradesmen who suffered loss waited upon the Home Secretary at the same time The points to which special 92 reference was made were the absence of all precaution against disturbance on the part of the police, and their delay in adopting active measures to quell the disorders; the feeling of insecurity for the future that this circumstance had produced, and the doubt that existed whether the law as it stood afforded adequate measures for compensating the innocent sufferers It was estimated that this loss, including property which was stolen by the rioters, amounted to about £12,000 The Home Secretary (the Right Hon Hugh E C Childers) expressed his sympathy with the sufferers, and stated that he conceived it to be the first duty of the Government to protect life and property As soon as public order had been restored he had commenced an enquiry into the conduct of the police on the occasion, and he assured both deputations that the Government would take every means in their power to secure order in the future As regards compensation, he would bring that subject before his colleagues A Bill was subsequently introduced into Parliament providing for payment of compensation out of the Police Hate REMOVAL OF REPUTED LUNATICS TO ASYLUMS The attention of the Vestry having been directed to certain proceedings in the Courts of Law which seemed to point to a necessity for more stringent regulations in the removal of reputed lunatics to Asylums, and their subsequent detention therein, the following resolution was passed:— That a communication be addressed to the Prime Minister, asking for an enquiry into the state of the law relating to the removal of reputed lunatics to asylums, and into the administration thereof, with a view to such reform in the law and procedure as may appear necessary for protecting the liberty of the subject, and preventing an unnecessary burden being cast upon the ratepayers for the maintenance of persons improperly removed to lunatic asylums 93 Having regard to the heavy cost incurred in the erection and maintenance of lunatic asylums, and to the contemplated erection of a fourth asylum for the county of Middlesex, it appeared to the Vestry that some such enquiry as they suggested, might possibly be followed by a reduction in the number of persons detained as lunatics, and consequently that the necessity for another asylum might be avoided for the present The Vestry accordingly invited other local authorities in the Metropolis to support their representations to the Prime Minister It is to be regretted that the Government did not see their way to instituting an enquiry, as supposing no amendment in the law is necessary, it would be satisfactory to be assured that adequate safeguards exist for the protection of the liberty of the subject RABID DOGS The Vestry took into consideration a suggestion by the Vestry of Lambeth, that an effort should be made to obtain further legislation empowering some public authority to destroy rabid dogs, but having regard to the powers already possessed by the police for this purpose, the Vestry failed to see the necessity for any further legislation It would appear desirable, however, that every dog should wear a collar identifying the owner of the animal, and some such provision might serve the double purpose of reducing the number of ownerless dogs wandering in the streets, and eusuring payment of the license duty by all owners of dogs liable thereto A suggestion to publish a notice intimating the early symptoms of rabies, and the best means of dealing with the same, did not commend itself to the vestry, they being of opinion that notices ot that description are calculated to alar u persons of a nervous temperament, and to intensify the very evil which such notices are intended to remedy 94 DEATH OF THE LORD MAYOR On the 14th April a resolution was unanimously adopted by the Yestry tendering their respectful sympathy to the Lady Mayoress in the irreparable loss her Ladyship had so recently sustained in the death of the Lord Mayor, Alderman Nottage This resolution was by no means merely a formal vote, for not only was the Lord Mayor a parishioner of St James's, but a short time before his death he had readily granted the Vestry permission to hold a Conference of the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis in the Mansion House, to consider what action might be adopted to check the increasing expenditure of the London School Board His lordship had also consented to preside over the Conference, but this intention was unhappily frustrated by his unexpected death Many members of the Vestry expressed a desire to attend the funeral in St Paul's Cathedral, to testify their respect to his lordship, but the number of applications from all quarters was so large that the Committee having charge of the funeral arrangements were unable to find room for any representatives from this Parish CONCLUDING REMARKS The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellowparishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner as possible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish By Order, HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk 95

The following work was carried out on the footways in streets which have been repaved:—York stone relaid, ()9,679^ square feet, granite kerb reset 11,893 feet run. These dimensions include 31,147 feet 3 inches of new York stone, and 3,341 feet 7 inches of new kerb. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were:—Wood, 34 cart loads; iron, 10 tons 1(3 cwt.; York stone, 2,543 square feet; pitching, 107 cart loads; kerb, 100 feet run. WILKES' "EUREKA" PAYING.

LITTLE PULTENEY STREET IMPROVEMENT. The alterations to the roadway necessary to effect this improvement have been almost at a standstill during the greater part of the year. In November a new 3ft. 9in. by 2ft. Gin. egg-shaped brick sewer was constructed, at a cost of £1,233 10s. 3d. in lieu of the old one, and at a greater depth, in order to drain the new houses. The widening and lowering of the streets have now been commenced in earnest, and will 101 shortly be completed. The cost fur the year amounted to £253 la. 1d. In accordance with the directions of your Vestry the old wood paving was given away to a number (85) of poor parishioners. LICENSES Have been granted for the erection of ninety-one hoardings and scaffolds for the purposes of re-building, alterations, Licensc has also been given in thirty-eight cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of making good these openings is charged to the person taking out the liccnce. COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months one hundred and forty-six coal plates were cut into the paving. STREET NAMES. The sum of £5 18s. has been expended in purchasing and fixing street name-plates, principally for altering the names of Cambridge Street and Little Windmill Street to Lexington Street, and Blenheim Street to Ramilies Street. LIGHTING. Three "Lambeth" lamps of eighty candle power have been fixed at tlie refuges in Regent Street by Argyll Place, New Burlington Street, and Air Street; and six "Victoria" lamps, with a large light, placed at Piccadilly Circus by your Vestry, in addition to fifteen others of the same pattern erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works. In December the burners in the lamps in Regent Street and Waterloo Place were altered so as to consume 4 c. ft. of cannel gas each per hour, instead of 2½c. It. as formerly. There Have also been several other minor alterations to the lamps in various parts of the parish. The cost of repairing the refuge lamps 102 providing and fixing new lamps and posts, and alterations to old lamps, was £225 11s. 7d. The sewer at the lower part of Arundel Street has been lowered by your Vestry, at the expense of the owner of the Hotel Previtali, to give better drainage to those premises. Several of the small subsidiary sewers running under the vaults of the houses in Regent Street have been partially blocked. In each ease the stoppage was removed, and where found necessary the old barrel drain destroyed and earthenware pipes substituted. The cost of repairing sewers, bricking up old disused drains, new side entrance covers, &c., amounted to the sum of £20 12s. 9½d. for the year. GULLIES. Sixty-five gullies have been reconstructed at a cost of £276 8s. 11d. They are situate as follows:— Brewer Street 2 Burlington Street (Old) 1 Carnaby Street 1 Charles Street 2 Duko Street 1 Golden Square 2 Heddon Street 2 James Street (Lower) 2 „ (Upper) 2 Jermyn Street 13 King Street (Regent Street) 11 Marlborough Mews 1 Norris Street 1 Peter Street 5 Portland Street 8 Princes Street (Regent Street) 1 Pulteney Street (Little) 2 Sherwood Street 4 Warwick Street (Regent Street) 4 65 SEWERS. 103 CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £170 0s. 11d., and for emptying 1,216 gullies £73 3s. 7d. The accumulation removed from the sewers and gullies being carted away by the slopping contractor, under his contract, without extra expense. CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Thirty-two new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cast of water was £51 19s. 3d. and new hose £14 10s. 10d. DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounting to 1,093 gallons of carbolic acid, and 13 cwt. of carbolic powder, costing £96 0s. 5d.

Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, for the year 1885. The census of 1881 gives the District of tho Parish of St. James as covering an area of 162 acres, and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub-District appears us covering an area of 54 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. The Berwick Street Sub-District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. Taking these data from the census, tho mean density of the population of the whole District appears as 184 per acre, while the density of the population in tho Golden Square Sub- 146 District appears 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub-District as 169 persons per acre. The net mortality for the year 1885 was 451 deaths. Taking the population at 29,805, 451 deaths gives a death rate of 15.1 per 1,000. The mortality from Zymotic diseases during the year has been 36, and there has been in addition 1 other death among Zymotic cases removed from the parish to extra-Parochial Hospitals. Vide Table II., page 155. Of Fever and Small Pox, 43 cases came under notice during the year; but many cases may not have been known, there being as yet no law requiring that notice of such cases be given to the Sanitary Authority. Of these 43 cases, 18 were of Small Pox, 2 of Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, 22 of Scarlet Fever, and 1 was certified as due to Choleraic Diarrhoea. 33 of the 43 cases—18 of Small Pox, and 21 of Scarlet Fever— were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. During the year 1885, 33 bodies were removed into the Mortuary, in 8 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the family would have lived and slept in the presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly a post-mortem would have to be made before interment could take place. In 2 cases the bodies have been removed from hotels or lodging-houses. Twenty inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 20 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 147 The following number of Deaths were registered as harin;' occurred in St. James's during the year 1885: First Quarter 151 Second Quarter 110 Third Quarter 125 Fourth Quarter 90 Gross mortality for year 1885 476 Deduct deaths of Non-Parishioners:— Dying in the Workhouse 20 Dying in the Throat Hospital 6 — 26 450 Add one death among Zymotic cases removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals 1 Net mortality for the year 18S5 451 451 deaths in a population of 29,865 is a death-rate of 15.1 per thousand. The net mortality and death-rates of St. James's for each year have been decreasing. These facts for the last ten years are shown in the following table: Gross Net Death Mortality. Mortality.

EDWIN BROOKS and WILLIAM HILL WATSON Inspectors of Nuirsences. 164 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875. REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1885, made to the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, by JAS. EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James, Westminster. Key. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1885, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 38 samples were examined, all being procured for examination by the Vestry Officers. Of milk, 13 specimens have been examined. Twelve of these samples were found to have been adulterated. Of the vendors, two were cautioned by the Vestry. Ten vendors were brought before the magistrate, and of these two were let off on payment of costs ; four were fined half-a-crown, in addition to being mulcted in costs ; one was fined five shillings and costs; one was fined seven shillings and sixpence and costs; and one was fined twenty shillings and costs; one was fined five pounds and costs. In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend from the Vestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Piccadilly, 1886. 165 The following caution has been sent out by the Vestry " Parish of St. James, Westminster. '' Vestry Hall, '' Piccadilly, W. ''19th April, 1886. '' SIR, '' The attention of the Vestry having been called to the increasing practice of tradesmen selling Butterine and other imitations of Butter, as the genuine article. I am directed to remind you that the sale of an article different in substance from that demanded by the purchaser is an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and renders the vendor liable to a penalty of £20. " The Vestry believe that many of the imitations of Butter are wholesome substitutes, and they therefore desire to point out to those parishioners whom it may concern, that articles of this description may be legally sold if they are truthfully described and not sold as Butter. This remark, of course, does not apply to any article which contains injurious or fraudulent admixture of a foreign substance. '' In the event of an article purchased as Butter proving on analysis to consist either wholly or partially of some other substance, the Vestry will be compelled to put the Law in force, in the interest of other tradesmen as well as of purchasers. '' I am, Sir, '' Your obedient Servant, '' HARRY WILKINS. "Vestry Clerk." 166 PARISH OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER.
