Greorge Samuel Elliott and Samuel Rayson were re-elected Churchwardens on Easter Tuesday, April 8th, 1890, Mr. Charles Edwiu Watts being elected as their colleague. Messrs. Robert Stephens Cufflin, Arthur Robert Chamberlayne, and William Henry Walkley, having been duly nominated by the Vestry, were appointed Overseers by the local Justices on the 16tli April, 1890. The following appointments were made by the Vestry on Easter Tuesday, 1890 :— As Commissioners of the Burial Board.—Messrs. Henry Samuel Friend, John Lawrence, and Samuel Price. As Assessors.—Messrs. Edwin Cox, Henry Charles Dove, George S. Elliott, H. S. Friend, John S. Furlong, William Groodman, Thomas Hollyman, James Kerry, W. Hepple Peacock, James May Stroud, William Henry Walkley, and William Wells. As Solicitor.—Mr. William Lewis -As Sexton.—Mr. Horace Baker. Inspector of Houses for Slaughtering Horses pursuant to 26 Geo. III., Ch. 71.—Mr. H. J. H. Tuck. The Assessment Committee was appointed on April 18th, 1890, pursuant to the Valuation (Metropolis) Act of 1869, and consisted of Messrs.

The nomination of Vestrymen and Auditors took pi ice on Monday, May 19th, 1890. At the polls, which were held on the following day in wards 3, 5, and 8, about 1,200 persons recorded their votes, 1 he constituencies being estimated to contain 12,000 persons qualified to vote. There were 44 vacancies altogether, and these were tilled up by the re-election of 29 old members and by the election of 13 entirely new to office. 12 The dual election of Mr. John Lawrence for Wards 2 and 3, and of Mr. Alfred Memory for Wards 4 and 8, necessitated a second nomination for Wards 2 and 4, Mr. Lawrence having elected to stand for Ward 3 and Mr. Memory for Ward 8. These nominations took place on Monday, June 16th, 1890, and the polls the following day. Mr. George James Young was returned for Ward 2, and Mr. Win. Adams for Ward 4. On June 6th, 1890, Messrs Wm. D. M. Forrest, John Alfred Grrasemann, John Oldis, Fredk. B. S. Sargeant, and Edward C. Smith, were elected Auditors of the General and other Vestry Rates.

Lancaster, Jno. Lawrence, J. H. Mote, and Samuel Rayson. In November, 1890, Messrs. Lancaster and Mote retired, pursuant to the 9 & 10 Vic., c. 74, by effluxion of time, and on December 5th, the vacancies were filled up by the re-election of Mr. Lancaster and the election of Mr. G. S. Elliott in the place of Mr. Mote. The following Vestrymen resigned their seats during the year: Mr. A. R. Chamberlayne... Ward 1, Upper Hollowav. „ John Richardson ... Ward 2, Lower Holloway, ,, J. R. "W ard ... ... ,, ,, ,, ,, „ J. Douglass Mathews Ward 6, St. Mary's. The following Vestrymen became disqualified :— Mr. Alfred G. Aaron ... Ward 3, Highbury. „ Otto Strauss „ „ „ „ Wm. Dobbs Ward 4, Thornhill. The death of Sir James Tyler, which occurred on April 5th, 1890, was a loss not only to the Parish but to the Metropolis. Sir James was a Justice of the Peace for the Finsbury Division. It is not in that capacity however that he will be best remembered. His munificent donations to the Orphan Working Home at Haverstock Hill and to numerous other charities will constitute a more lasting record. It was characteristic of the man that a promise of £1,000 towards the endowment of a Technical Institute in the Parish, made some years since in the Vestry Hall, should have been remembered and performed upon his death-bed, a cheque for the amount having been signed and forwarded through his brother to the Honorary Secretary but a few days before he passed away. The Parish has lost another of its oldest and most respected inhabitants by the death of Mr. Jacob Vincent of 24, Highbury-place, for many years a member of the Board of Trustees and subsequently of the Vestry. Mr. Vincent was of Huguenot descent. He was born in London in 1802. For twenty years he was an active and useful member of the Islington Vestry and the bosom friend of 16 Dr. Win. Harvey, mid although he had outlived his contemporaries there are many men yet living who can remember his great and successful exertions to secure the purchase of Finsbury-park, of itself sufficient to entitle him to the lasting gratitude of t he inhabitants of this district. He was also instrumental in securing the improvement of Islingtongreen. On the 10th June, 1890, the Vestry lost by death an old and faithful servant in Henry Isaac Collingwood, who had presided over the Sanitary Staff of the Vestry with great ability since his appointment in 18(57. The remarks made by the Medical Officer of Health in concluding his report for last year with regard to Mr. Collingwood will be endorsed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him intimately. Mr. James R. Leggatt,Chief Sanitary Inspector of Wigan, was appointed to succeed him as Superintendent of the Sanitary Department on July 25tli, 1890. The doubts expressed in last year's report as to the restoration to health and work of another old servant have been confirmed. The resignation of Mr. Charles Higgins, who, after an experience of eight years with the old Commissioners of Sewers, had for 34 years held the appointment of Surveyor of Sewers and Buildings in the Parish of Islington, was received in July, 1890, the Vestry having previously awarded him, in consideration of his long and valuable services, the full superannuation allowance it was entitled to grant under 29 Vic., c. 31.* Mr. Higgins' old foreman, Enoch Browning—the faithful although humble coadjutor in his work both in Islington and with the Commissioners of Sewers—having become too old and infirm for duty, retired about the same time as his superior officer, with the result that a lifetime's honest devotion to duty was in his case also recognised by a superannuation allowance. * This allowance was not granted too soon, nor too long enjojed. On the 6th of June, 1801, Mr. Higgins died. He was buried in his family grave at Fiuchley, many of his old friends and colleagues being present on the occasion. A touching incident in connection with his interment was the attendance at the cemetery of a number of sewirmen to pay their last respects to their chief. One named Richard Emmett stated that he had worked under Mr. Higgins for over 44 years. 17 A gratifying feature in the career of Mr. Samuel Prise (whose retirement was dealt with in the report for last year) was the presentation to the Vestry, on the 4th July, 1890, of a full-length oil painting of that gentleman. It had been subscribed for by Mr. Price's numerous friends and admirers in recognition of the lengthy and efficient service he had rendered to the Parish, and obviously no more fitting place could be selected for its reception than the Yestry Hall. The painting is by M. Emile Girardot, a Belgian artist, who, both at the Royal Academy and in the Salons of Paris, has obtained considerable distinction. It is needless, therefore, to add that a valuable work of art has been added to the Islington collection of local worthies. On November 7th a deputation of "local villagers" and other gentlemen interested in Islington attended before the Vestry to ask its acceptance of the identical painting of Lieut. Col. Aubert to which the following reference is made in Nelson's History of Islington— " There is a good likeness of Mr. Aubert in the European Magazine for November, 1798, from a painting by Drummond, and in the parlour of the first floor of the ' Angel and Crown ' at Islington is a full length portrait of him, dismounted and holding his charger, as commanding officer of the loyal Islington Volunteers, who are represented in the background. It was painted by Mather Brown." This Col. Aubert was an amateur astronomer of considerable note having been elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1772. At Highbury House, where he resided, he is said to have erected, with the aid of Smeaton, the eminent engineer, one of the finest observatories in the country. During the excitement caused by the French Revolution he raised the " Loyal Islington Volunteers," a body "»f which he was chosen Colonel. It is hardly necessary to add that the Yestry accepted the gift and that the painting now occupies a conspicuous position on the walls of the Vestry Hall. It is due to Mr. Chas. Townley, the Superintendent Registrar, whose interest in the literary and artistic past of " the merrie village " as he likes still to call it is unlimited, to say that it is owing to his efforts that this relic has at last found a fitting home.

The area of Islington is 3,107 statute acres. At the census taken on April 6th, 1891, the parish contained a population of 319,433 and 38,259 inhabited houses. This population, though probably the largest of any single parish in the United Kingdom, is yet considerably under what it had been estimated to be having regard to the rate of increase of the decade from 1871 to 1881 or to the increase in the number of the houses in the parish. When it is, however, borne in mind that the parish is now almost entirely built over, it is very evident that the past rates of increase can no longer operate. Indeed, in this respect a parish may be said to be less elastic than a town or borough since the boundaries of the former are practically lixed while those of the latter may be from time to time enlarged. A eomparatively small annual increase (if any) -> 19 must henceforward be anticipated, and, it is not improbable that in a few years, as with the neighbouring parish of St. Pancras, there may be a retrograde movement. The particulars of the population of the parliamentary divisions and wards of the parish are not yet published. ASSESSMENT AND RATEABLE VALUE. As intimated in last year's report the Vestry and likewise the Assessment Committee in view of the approaching Quinquennial Valuation of the Metropolis had addressed letters to the London County Council pointing out the difficulties which attended the due carrying out by bodies of Overseers or Assessment Committees of those sections of the Valuation Act of 1869 which provide for appeals against the totals of the Valuation Lists of other parishes, and inviting that body, as the central metropolitan authority, to take action in the matter. The necessity for some supervision over the preparation of the Valuation Lists of other parishes had been apparent to the Islington authorities since the Quinquennial Valuation of 1885, but the difficulty had been how to efficiently check an unduly low estimate of their respective values by the authorities of other parishes whilst in the throes of a valuation of Islington. The necessity for action had, however, grown with the growth of metropolitan or central burdens as compared with local charges, since it was evidently becoming more and more to the interest of parishes or unions not gifted with a too keen perception of what was due to their neighbours to keep the basis of their contributions to such central charges at as low a figure as possible. With the immediate approach of the Quinquennial Valuation the necessity became paramount, and the Vestry, as before stated, approached the County Council accordingly. The request of the Vestry having been supported by other Assessment Committees and rating authorities, the London County Council, in May, 1890, convened a conference in order to ascertain the mode of administering the Valuation Act adopted in the various pariphes of the metropolis and the views of the representatives thereat as to the desirability of the Council intervening. b 2 20 Thin Conferenee held Severn! meetings, at which Islington wjih represented by severnl members of I,Ik? Assessment- Committee and by the Vestry Clerk. Evidence wji.h abundantly forthcoming by the n.( I it i i hh i < > r i of rcprencntat ives of certain parishes Mm,I, I heir admin i strati on of I,Ik? Valuation Act wjih l,<» say I ho least loose and principally ccn fined l,o keeping Mk? rates down in I heir respective localities. The Council ultimately resolved to take action, and gave? not,ice of appeal against the Valuation Lists of Mk? (lil y of London, 81,. George Hanover Bquare, SI/. Marylebone and other parishes, which were alleged to |h? under assessed l.o I ho <• xI,<• 111, of CM00,000. The fact Mini Mk? London County Council, aflor due consideration and consultation with able valuers, iool< such a stop, is sufficient justification for I,he n,el,ion of I ho local authorities of this parish ; and, although I Ih^ total amount of the surcharges will possibly not be sustained, Mio eontribul ions of iHlington in respect of metropolitan chargOH will certainly be I<?hh than tliey otherwise won Id have been. The fifth Quinquennial Valuation of the pjirisli having been prepared by the Assessors in t he early part of I HJiO wjih depoHifed in twelve books on the 30th May of that year. Kach book corresponded to a rate collecting (1 i^l ric.t. The total number of nil cable hereditaments contained in them wjih 411,01(1, the total grosn value £'2,(KJ8,(il4, and the total rateabh? value £'1,(1011,190. TheHe figures Allowed an inereiiHe on the provioUH Quinquennial Lint of about, 2,1500 in the number of rateable hereditaments and £'711,1100 in their rateable value. Thin increase wjih, however, solely due to two special classes of propert y, vi: Public Companies and Public IIoiihoh. Indeed, but for these, as indicated in the report of the AHHOHHinent Committee, the rateabh? value <»' the parinli would have hIicwii a, considerable decline. For further details, both ji,h to Mie preparation of the List, and the mode in which it was subsequently dealt with by the Assessment Committee, the reader iH referred to tin? reports of the Hoard of Assessor* and of Mk? Assessment Committee, both of which are appended. In connection with the re-valuation it became noeoHsary to deI(Minim? all the existing agreements under the "Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, IH(!!)." Notice to this effect wan addresHod to all 21 persons who had entered into an arrangement for compounding in respect of small properties in the several collecting districts, and 353 new agreements under section 3 of the said Act, representing 3,543 hereditaments, have since been entered into, the commission allowed off the rates paid in respect thereof being, with a very few exceptional cases, 15 per cent. It is to be noted that the total of the hereditaments now under compound is far in excess of the total of five years ago, when the Commission Agreements represented but 1,936 hereditaments. This increase is mainly due to the large number of blocks of artizans dwellings which have since been erected in various parts of the parish- Since the deposit of the Quinquennial List 308 new buildings have been erected and assessed. These consist chiefly of houses on the Highbury Gardens and Highbury Place estates, and at Whitehall Park, Upper Holloway. The total result of this addition, together with the increase in consequence of structural alterations, amounts to £14,817 gross, and £12,348 rateable value. These amounts added to the figures shewn in the Quinquennial List as altered, gives the grand total of £2,040,038 gross and £1,698,452 rateable as the total valuation of the parish at Lady Day, 1891. RATES. The total rates for the year amounted to 5s. 0½d. in the £, being 4½d. more than those for 1889-90 and the highest levied in Islington since the passing of the Metropolis Management Act in 1855. The details are as follow:- Made on the 7th Feb., 1890. Made on the 1st Aug., 1890. Total. Rates for previous year. Poor Rate 1 5½ 1 4½ 2 9¾ 2 0 Lighting Rate 0 1 0 1¼ 0 2¼ 0 2 General Rate 0 11¾ 1 0 1 11¾ 1 9½ Sewers Rate 0 0¼ 0 0½ 0 0¾ 0 1 Consolidated Rate - - - 0 5 Supplemental Rate - - - 0 2½ 2 6½ 2 6 5 1½ 4 8 22 The estimates upon which these rates were based will be found appended. It is to be noted that out of this 5s. 0½d. in the £ the amount required for expenditure controlled by the Vestry is not quite 1s. 3¾d., the remainder being for the expenditure of central and other Boards over which it is needless to say the Vestry exercises no control. The following tabular statement shews that of the increase of 4½d. before referred to the Vestry is responsible for less than ¼d. in the £, while the increased requirements of the London School Board and the County Council have necessitated additional rating, as compared with last year, of nearly 3½d. in the £.

Of the debit unrecovered a sum of £16,213 is accounted for by empty property, whilst of the balance remaining £3,813 was due to allowances for halfquarters, reduced assessments, and commission allowed to owners. The losses which may be termed avoidable, namely rates excused and "runs," amounted to £1,949, or less than 10s. per cent. of the total debit. Year ending Lady-day. Amount to be collected.

During the past year the average number per quarter has been 1,806 as compared with 2,010 for the year 1889-90. During the year 25,665 summonses were issued for the recoverv of rates, an average of 6,416 per quarter. This is an increase upon the figures of last year. Notwithstanding the large number of summonses, however, an average of 1,056 persons per quarter only came before the Justices to ask for time. Hence it may be inferred that by a large number of ratepayers the summons is awaited as the final demand for payment. 2,857 warrants of distress were handed to the brokers for execution, but actual levies took place in only 341 instances, the rates having been in most cases paid to the broker upon his attending to make the levy. In very few cases have the goods been removed or sold. Committal warrants were obtained in 40 cases, principally against old offenders. Of these 17 paid prior to or upon arrest, 15 absconded, and 8 were conveyed to Holloway prison. The sum of £1,152 1s. 6d. has been received by the Vestry Clerk in respect of summons fees, and paid by him to the Vestry's bankers to the credit of the general rate. A return shewing the rates levied in the parish since the constitution of the Vestry in 1856 will be found in the appendix. HIGHWAYS. The cost of labour on the roads during the year amounted to £12,787 1s. 1d., as against £9,379 17s. 5d. for the year ending Lady Day, 1 890. This increase (£3,407 3s. 8d.) was caused principally by the additional labour necessitated by the frost and snow of last winter. It is also to some extent attributable to labour employed in breaking stone and screening materials at the Ashburton Grove Depot. The following table shews the quantities of materials used in the repair of the roads, in the formation of pitched crossings, and in improvement works. The pitching in Caledonian Road and Balls Pond Road is not included:- £ s. d. 8,560 yards cube Guernsey Granite 7,439 9 4 1,400 „ „ Leicester and other Granite 1,035 3 6 24  £ s. d. 244 yards cube Leicester Granite Sittings 134 8 0 77 „ ,, Kentish Rag 41 7 9 4,748 „ ,, Flints 1,876 2 2 410 „ „ Ballast 143 11 7 546 „ „ Hoggin for Footpaths 169 8 4 1,939 „ „ „ Carriageways 574 6 6 66 ,, ,, Brick Rubbish 6 12 0 236 tons 12½ cwt.

A less quantity of materials has been used for the repair of the macadam and flint carriageways than during the previous year, snow storms and the long continued frost having interfered with repairs for six or seven weeks. The price of Guernsey granite and other road materials, with the exception of ballast and hoggin, has again increased, whilst the prices of masons' and paviors' work have been slightly lower than last year. MACADAM ROADS. The following have been converted from Hint into macadamized roads:— Grosvenor Road, from Petherton Road to Newington Green Road. Highbury Station Road. Arlington Street, from Packington Street to the south-west end of the street. CUBING WORKS.

Orleans Road, by Cromartie Road. St. John's Park, near Holloway Road. Foxham Road, by Board School. Horsell Road, by Drayton Park. Balfour Road, opposite Highbury Grange. SNOW STORMS. On the 28th November, 1890, snow fell to a depth of 2 inches. Additional men were engaged to assist in clearing the roads, the cost of which was as follows:- £ s. d. Labour 153 18 6 Horses and drivers for sweeping machines and water vans engaged in melting snow 7 3 0 Total £161 1 6 About a-half to three-quarters of an inch of snow fell on the 15th and 17th December, 1890, the roads being at that time hard with frost. On the 19th snow began to fall in the early hours of the morning and continued until 3 p.m. when it was about 4½ inches deep. The Vestry's staff assisted by a number of additional men were then set to work clearing the roads. A further fall of 2 inches occurred later in the afternoon of Saturday the 20th. The snow at this date lay on the ground to a total depth of between 6 and 7 inches in those roads which had not been touched. Additional men were again engaged, and, with the Vestry's staff, cleared the centres, channels, and crossings in the principal thoroughfares, and the channels and crossings in those less 31 important roads in which the snow in the centres having become frozen into a solid mass of ice could not be dealt with. The frost continued until the 26th when a slight thaw occurred, but was followed by frost until the 1st January, 1891, when a thaw again set in for a short time. Up to that time the snow had remained in heaps at the sides of the principal thoroughfares, but on the 2nd January the Vestry decided to cart it away. Additional men, horses and carts were immediately engaged, and the work of removal was proceeded with from the 3rd until the 15th January, during which time 11,929 cubic yards of snow were removed and stacked in the depot at Ashburton Grove, around the squares, and in certain roads having no houses on one side. Prior to this, 1,648 cubic yards of snow had been carted to the depots from important sections of main thoroughfares. Snow fell again on the 8th January to a depth of 1½ inches, when the roads were once more cleared by the aid of additional men. As soon as a general thaw commenced the snow which had been placed round the squares and in other roads was melted with the aid of water and passed down the gullies into the sewers. The following are the particulars of the cost connected with the clearing of the roads and melting the snow at the various places:- £ s. d. Labour in clearing the roads 2,298 17 9 Horses and drivers for sweeping machines and water vans, engaged in melting snow on the roads 23 6 0 Cartage of snow from intersections and from main thoroughfares 623 15 8 Melting snow at deôpt and various shoots:— Labour 394 19 4 Horses and drivers for water vans 75 7 8 Salt, including carting and spreading 97 11 0 Total £3,513 17 5 A further fall occurred on the night of the 9th March and continued until the morning of the 10th, when the snow lay three inches deep and in some places where it had drifted even as 32 much as 18 inches. The pitched roads were cleared by melting the snow, with the aid of salt and running it down the gullies into the sewers. Snow fell again on the night of the 10th and in the early hours of the 11th to a depth of three inches when the same proceedings were adopted. The cost of the work was as follows:- £ s. d. Labour 419 9 4 Horses and drivers for sweeping machines and water vans, melting snow 63 7 0 Salt, including carting and spreading 161 15 0 Total £644 11 4 During this exceptional continuance of frost and snow the Vestry realised to some extent the experience of the old man and the ass in the fable. Complaints were first made of the non-removal of snow from the streets. The snow was cleared from the centres foot-paths and channels, and stacked along the sides. It was immediately pointed out that this latter practice interfered with trade. The Vestry directed that it should be carted away from the main thoroughfares and stacked round the sides of squares and open spaces, it being pecuniarily impossible to remove it out of the parish. It was thereupon sought to make the Vestry the subject of proceedings at the Clerkenwell Police Court for causing a nuisance; and, although the common-sense of the magistrate prevented any process issuing, indirectly pressure was put upon the Vestry to make another departure by salting the snow and running it down the sewers. This process was succesrfullv carried out, but not without risk of a protest from the London County Council against the use made of their sewers, and remonstrances in the public press against the cruelty to horses of using salt on the roads of the parish. SANDING ROADS. The long and severe frost also necessitated a great amount of work upon the roads in order to render them safe for traffic; and during six weeks 3,025 cubic yards of sand and other material were spread, which, together with the labour for spreading, cost £536. 12s, 10d. 33 IMPROVEMENT WORKS. Highgate Hill.—North-east side in front of west view. The piece of ground in front of Nos. 9 to 19, both inclusive, which was referred to in the last annual report, has been made up and added to the carriageway at a cost of £9. 10s. 10d. Hornsey Rise.—North-east side, at north and south entrances to Hornsey Rise Gardens. The levels of the carriageway have been improved by raising them to correspond with the levels of the new road work in Hornsey Rise Gardens, at a cost of £35. 11s. 8d. Dartmouth Parle Hill.— West side, from Dartmouth Park Avenue to No. 1, Bramshill Gardens. The owner of the property abutting on this part of the road having agreed to give up a strip of ground for the purpose of widening the road, on condit ion that a dwarf wall surmounted by cleft oak palings was constructed in front of his property and the improvement carried out free of cost to him, an arrangement was made between the St. Pancras and the Islington Vestries that the cost of the improvement should be borne equally by the two parishes. The ground having been surrendered the work, which included beside the erection of the wall referred to the formation of a paved footway, has been completed. The cost has not yet been ascertained. Elthorne Road.—North-west side, from the south-west side of Sunny side Road to the gulley opposite No. 159; and from Scholefield Road to Nicholay Road. An additional gulley having been constructed in each of these portions, the pitched channels have been relaid to improved gradients at a cost of £12. 19s. 4d. The pitched crossing over the road opposite the south-west side of Sunnyside Road has been taken up, lengthened, and relaid in a new direction, from the south-west corner of Sunnyside Road to a point opposite No. 194, Elthorne Road, at a cost of £12. 1s. 1d. Seven Sisters Road.—North-west side in front of No. 95; and Hornsey Road, south-west side in front cf Nos. 191 and 193, and at the flank of 95, Seven Sisters Road. The owners of the new buildingerected on the vacant ground at the corner of these roads having given up a strip of ground of an average width of 12 inches and containing four super yards in front of the building, it has been added to the c 34 public way and paved. The same owners, being desirous of bringing out the flank of the building referred to and the fronts of two proposed buildings adjoining in Hornsey Road beyond the general line of buildings on the south-west side of that road, agreed to erect the proposed buildings at a distance of 45 foot from the opposite side of the road, and to give up the ground between on condition that the Vestry removed the urinal from that part of the road, made up the ground given up, and paved a footpath in front of the buildings. To these terms the Vestry assented, and the ground, which is an average width of 10 feet 10 inches and contains an area of 126 super yards, has been given up and the urinal removed. The road making and paving work is in progress. Russell Road.—North-east side, in front of the "Bedford Arms'' public-house. The gravel footway has been paved, the Vestry and the owner of the premises each paying a moiety of the cost. The Vestry's proportion of the cost amounted to £13. 10s. Highbury Park.— West side. A row of sub-kerb has been placed at the high part of the footway from and including part of No. 53 to No. 57; and from the latter place to and including No. 61, two rows have been placed, at a cost of £22. 11s. 2d. Highbury Grove.— West side in front of No. 37 and 39. A piece of ground which was surrendered at the time the houses were built has been made up and formed into a footway, a kerb laid, the ground paved and a pitched channel laid at a cost of £16. 2s. 11d. This was the only part of the road where no footway existed. Highbury Crescent West.—The gates at the entrance to this road by Holloway Road have been removed by agreement with the freeholder, who made it a condition that the Vestry should erect the gates in a yard off Upper Street which is the property of the freeholder. The cost of the work amounted to £15. 15s. 11d. Highbury Crescent.— Old kerb redressed has been laid to the following portions of the gravel footway round Highbury Fields at a cost of £43. 15s. 6d.; North entrance, from Highbury Place to a point opposite No. 19, Highbury Crescent; South entrance, from a point opposite the division wall between No. 1 and 2 to No. 12. 35 Caledonian Road and Roman Road.—The kerb at the north-east corner of Roman Road has been set back a distance of 4 feet 8 inches, and the ground added to the carriageway; the pitched crossing over the road has been lengthened, the line of kerb improved, and the dangerously steep inclination of the footways at the corner of both roads abolished. The improvement will make the turning of the corner from Caledonian Road to Roman Road much easier and safer for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. A pitched channel has also been laid on the north-east side of the latter road from Caledonian Road to a point 48 feet south-east thereof. The total cost of the work amounted to £17. 19s. 1d. Kingsland Green.-— South-east side from a point 49 feet 6 inches south of the south-east side of Boleyn Road to the rear of No. 3 Kingsland High, Street, and west side from Boleyn Road to Kingsland Passage.

Ralls Pond Road.—South side from Southgate Road to and including No. 219.—The kerb has been set back a distance of 1 foot 6 inches at the widest part and the line improved. The portion taken off the footway has been added to the carriageway in order to increase the space between the train lines and the kerb. The total cost of the work amounted to £18. 15s. 10d. Upper Street.—West side, from No. 215 to No. 234, both inclusive.— The low level tar paved footway has been added to the carriageway, and paved with old granite setts taken from Ball's Pond Road redressed and laid on a foundation of new concrete.

Brunswick Street.—The owners of the wall across the west end of the street having agreed to give up their interest in it, the Vestry has removed the wall, and the street which was previously a cul-de-sac C 2 36 has been made into a thoroughfare. As the level of the street was higher than Francis Street, with which it has thus been made to communicate, the carriageway and footways had to be lowered between No. 5 and that street, sub-kerbs placed on each side between Francis Street and No. 8, and a gas main lowered. A pitched crossing has also been laid across the west end of the street. The total cost of the work amounted to £156. 7s. 6d. Payne Street. East Side.

The cost of maintaining the trees in the public roads has amounted to £17. 18s. 3d. A sum of £100 was received from the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association towards the cost of planting trees in the public thoroughfares of the parish. HIGHGATE HILL TRAMWAY. A communication was received from the Board of Trade in July 1890, forwarding copies of an additional regulation made by the Board in relation to the above Tramway. This regulation provided that no loaded waggon or other vehicle not adapted to the rails should be hauled on the Tramway in connection with any carriage containing passengers. HIDES STREET. The School Board for London having obtained a provisional order under the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, empowering them to take certain property abutting on Wellington Road, Westbourne Road, and Hides Street together with Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, Hides Street and also that portion of the street upon which those premises abut, the latter has been stopped up and appropriated by the Board. The Board agreed to remove the paving and deliver it to the Vestry's depot, and to construct a sewer along Westbourne Road East from Wellington Road to Hides Street, and also along that portion of the latter street which remains open in substitution for the sewer which passed under the property acquired and which would be interfered with when the School was built. This work has been carried out by the School Board under the supervision of the Surveyor. The length of the portion of the street taken by the Board is 87 feet 3 inches. The street was previously a cul-de-sac. 40 ARCHWAY ROAD. The Vestry, as was pointed out in the last annual report, had agreed to maintain this road on behalf of the London County Council upon the understanding that the Council would repay the Vestry the expenses incurred. The Council subsequently offered £120 per annum towards the cost of its maintenance, but upon the Vestry expressing its dissatisfaction with the proposal, it paid the account sent in by the Vestry for maintenance for the half-year ending Michaelmas, 1889, amounting to £68. 4s. 10d. This amount excluded the cost of lighting, that duty being apparently thrown upon the local authority by Sec. 11 (sub-sec. 11) of the Local Grovernment Act. The account for maintaining the road from the latter date up to Lady Day last (£905. 18s. 8d.) has been sent in to the Council. The desirability of widening this road and archway for the purpose of tramway traffic was again brought under the notice of the Vestry during the year. That body being of opinion that the responsibility for the maintenance of the archway structure had been transferred, together with that of the roadway, to the London County Council requested the Council to make arrangements with the Middlesex County Council or the Hornsey Local Board as the case might be for such widening of the roadway and alterations to the archway as might be necessary, and offered to bear a proportion of the Council's share of the cost. The members of the County Council representing Islington were urged to support this application and a communication was addressed to the Vestry of St. Pancras asking that body to request its representatives at the Council to take similar action. The Council however, shielding itself behind the provisions of sections 5 and 7 of the London Street Tramways Company's Act of 1888, declined to admit any responsibility for the reconstruction of the archway, but intimated that should the work be undertaken by the Vestry in conjunction with the Hornsey Local Board a contribution towards the Vestry's proportion of the cost might be made. As was pointed out to the Council, the London Street Tramways Act of 1888 dealt with the Vestry because that body was at the time the highway authority in respect of Archway Road, 41 a position it ceased to occupy when the Local Government Act of 1888 transferred the jurisdiction over main roads to the Council. Later on, by invitation, the Vestry Clerk attended a meeting of the Highways Committee of the Council, and explained the relative position of the Vestry and the Hornsey Local Board and of the County Councils of London and Middlesex as regards this road. This would appear to have had some effect for a communication was shortly after received from the Council enclosing copies of letters from the Middlesex County Council, intimating that in their opinion the question of widening the roadway and rebuilding the archway was one which should be dealt with as regards that part within the County of Middlesex by the Hornsey Local Board and suggesting that a communication 011 the subject should be addressed to that authority. Having regard to the fact that the Hornsey Local Board stands in a different position to the Vestry in respect to the portion of the Archway Road in the Board's district, inasmuch as it has claimed to retain its powers and duties as a Highway Authority which the Vestry expressly refrained from doing, a reply was sent suggesting that the Council should do as suggested by the Middlesex County Council. The matter stood thus at the close of the year with which this report deals. MAIN ROADS. The (juestion of "main roads" as affected by the Local Government Act of 1888 was fully dealt with in the annual report of the Vestry for the year 1888-9, to which was appended a, report of the then Highways Committee 011 the subject. As mentioned in last year's report the Vestry, in July, 1889, applied to the County Council to declare all those roads in Islington "main roads" which were scheduled in the report of the Committee, but it was not until May, 1890, that a reply was received from the Council declining to accede to the application. The only "main road" therefore, in the parish is the Archway Road above mentioned, the cost of maintaining which should be, as just stated, defrayed by the London County Council. 42 BLACKSTOCK ROAD IMPROVEMENT. It was intimated in the last annual report that the Vestry had asked the London County Council to carry out this improvement on the best terms it was able to make and had offered to contribute one-half the cost but that the Council had declined to accede to the request. The Vestry subsequently resolved, in April, 1890, to accept the offer of the freeholder of the property to undertake the work for the sum of £3,000 at its own risk. Unfortunately, however, the delays which had occurred increased as they were by the difficulties created by the London County Council had so disgusted some of the owners of short interests that they had entered into fresh agreements with their sub-tenants, so that it is doubtful whether the opportunity offered has not passed away. WORKHOUSE LANE. Reference was also made in the last annual report to the unsatisfactory condition of the narrow lane leading from St. John's Road to Cheverton Road by the side of the boundary wall of the workhouse. In February last a notice was served upon the Vestry by the Guardians requesting the Vestry to take the necessary steps to obtain an order for stopping up and diverting the footway in question. The Vestry on the recommendation of its Works Committee agreed to the proposal, and instructed the Vestry Clerk to take the necessary steps for the purpose pursuant to 5 and 6 William IV., c. 50. The matter was receiving attention at the clo.-e of the year with which this report deals. NEW STREETS. 4,120 feet in length of roadway have been made and 9,513 feet in length of footway flagged by the Vestry during the past year pursuant to its powers under the Metropolis Local Management Acts. The Amendment Act, referred to on page 79, was also put in force to enable the Vestry to repair some 412 feet of roadway between Mount Pleasant and Rarnsbury Square. One petty sessions for the recovery of road-making expenses was held at the Vestry Hall during the year. 43 £5,388 3s. 1d. has been received during the year from owners of property while £7,329. 1s. l0d. has been paid by the Vestry during the same period for the making and paving of " new streets." The following are the streets in which work has been carried out during the year: — Archway Road, corners of Harberton Road and Whitehall Park.

The number of street lamps at Lady Day, 1891, was 4,398, gas being supplied to them at the cost of 2s. 2d. per 1,000 feet. 91 new lamps of the ordinary pattern have been erected during the year, as well as 99 ornamental lamps in Essex Road, Ball's Pond Road, Islington Green (north-east and south-east sides), Aberdeen Road, Seven Sisters' Road, and Bishop's Grove. The total cost of the gas supplied to street lamps for the year (including lighting, extinguishing, cleaning and painting) amounted to £12,518. 5s. 0d., as against £11,901. 9s. 3d. for the previous twelve months. £1,337. 10s. 5d. was expended in the purchase of new columns lanterns and fittings, and for general maintenance of street lamps. New refuge lamps have been fixed in Tufnell Park Road by Lady Margaret Road and in Highbury New Park at the junction of Grosvenor Road and by the north and south entrances of Highbury Quadrant. The positions of 99 lamps have been altered, the lighting of 102 has been discontinued, and 194 street name tablets have been fixed in others which occupy suitable positions at corners of streets. The substitution of 16 inch lanterns for old 14 inch lanterns has been continued, 140 of the former having been put up during the year. Permission has been granted for the erection of a private column lamp on the footway of Parkhurst Road at the entrance to Parkhurst Hall. One conviction has been obtained at the Clerkenwell Police Court against a person found guilty of wilfully damaging street lamps. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Early in 1890, as mentioned in the last annual report, the House to House Electric Supply Company, Limited, obtained a provisional order for the supply of electricity to the parish. It was hoped 46 that this Company, which had been installed for some time past at Kensington, meant business and that the inhabitants of Islington would soon have electricity brought to their doors. Thin order provided that within six months from its date The undertakers should deposit or secure to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade a sum of £1,000 as security for the works, and, within two years, lay suitable and sufficient distributing mains in certain streets scheduled therein. Since obtaining their powers, however, the Company have appeared in no hurry to commence operations, and at Lady Day no steps had been taken to carry the order into effect. In June, 1890, notices were served upon the Vestry by the London Klcetric Supply Company, Limited, The Brush Klectrical Engineering Company, Limited, The Camberwell and Islington Klectric Light and Power Supply Company, and the Laing, Wharton and Down Constructive Syndicate, Limited, of their intention to apply in the ensuing session for provisional orders to authorise theiri to supply electricity in the parish. With the exception of the Camberwell and Islington Company none of the orders were, however, proceeded with. The draft provisional order of the latter Company was referred to the Works Committee, for consideration. It practically coincided with the amended model order issued by the Board of Trade. The following streets were scheduled as those in which mains were to be laid within two years: City Road. Holloway Road. High Street. Tollirigton Road. Upper Street. Parkhurst Road. Park Street. Camden Road. Highbury Place. Seven Sisters' Road. Highbury New Park. Junction Road. Highbury Crescent. Caledonian Road. St. Paul's Road. Essex Road. The system proposed to be adopted by this Company differs from that of the House to House Company, the former being on the low tension system which enables electricity to be supplied not only 47 for lighting but also for power and other purposes, while the latter is on the high tension system with transformers on the consumers' premises. As was admitted at the enquiry held by Major Marindin in 1888 it is of advantage to admit two Companies to one area, since competition necessarily arises and more particularly when each Company works on a different system. Under these circumstances the Vestry decided, subject to the Company including Liverpool Road in the list of streets and entering into an agreement similar to that of the House to House Company with regard to certain other details, to give its consent, and the order was subsequently granted by the Board of Trade. An application was made to the Vestry by Mr. W. Beale of Hollowav Road for permission to lay electric mains in certain specified streets for the purpose of supplying electricity to the houses and premises therein. The Vestry, however, bearing in mind that Mr. Beale's original application had been for permission to lay electric mains along a portion of the Holloway Road only and that he was now seeking extended concessions and advantages without applying to the Board of Trade for a provisional order or licence, was of opinion that this further application should not be granted, and resolved accordingly. SEWERS AND DRAINS. During the past year new sewers have been constructed in the undermentioned parts of the parish, the works having been carried out under the General Sewer Works Contract.

The amount paid by way of contribution for right of entry into sewers constructed at the expense of the Vestry has been £171. 11s. 9d. 2,550 cubic yards of sludge were removed from the sewers and gullies of the parish during the 12 months and carted away by the Vestry's carts. All the small sewers were flushed during the summer at a cost for supply of water of £161. 8s. 9d. The gullies and ventilators were as usual freely deodorized. The sum of £791. 12s. 1½d. las been expended for repairs and alterations to existing sewers. 49 The weekly wages of the foremen and sewermen employed by the Vestry has amounted to £1,709. 0s. 4d. Sewers with the necessary manholes, lamp-lioles, gullies, ventilators, &c., have also been constructed at the expense of owners under the superintendence of the surveyor in the following roads, the plans and sections having been first approved by the Vestry and the London County Council.

The four stall iron urinal on the footpath on the south-west side of Hornsey Road (north-east of Seven Sisters' Road) having been taken down and removed, a contract was entered into for the fixing of a new six stall iron and slate urinal in Hornsey Road, opposite the "Eaglet" P.H., in substitution thereof. The work was commenced in August, 1890, but owing to the great opposition which was offered by the occupiers of the adjacent premises the site had to be abandoned. Arrangements have now been made for fixing the urinal referred to in the northern portion of Kelvin Road opposite the Highbury Barn Tavern. The urinals in the parish are 38 in number and contain 167 compartments. The whole of these urinals have been cleaned down repaired and repainted, the work having been carried out under a special contract. The cost amounted to £189. 1s. 9d. The cost of water supplied by the New River Company to the urinals during the year amounted to £58. 16s. 0d. FRONTAGE LINES, NEW STREETS, &c. Copies of 30 notices and plans shewing proposed frontage lines, new streets, or alterations of frontage in the parish, have been forwarded by the London County Council for any suggestion the Vestry might have to make thereon. The proposed works include 22 newliouses, 39 shops, 19 additions to existing houses, 7 new streets, 1 block of baths and washliouses, 1 church addition and 1 warehouse. STREET NOMENCLATURE. The following roads have been re-named or re-numbered and the necessary notices served upon the occupiers pursuant to orders made by the London County Council.

Upon this occasion an enormous quantity of water fell during the space of one hour. The northern high level sewer was overfull at Tufnell Park Road by Carleton Road, nearly full at Holloway Road near Tollington Road, and overfull at Tollington Road and Monsell Road. The Hackney Brook sewer in Holloway Road was overfull from H ampden Road to its outlet into the northern high level sewer opposite Tufnell Park Road. The Cattle Market outfall sewer was overfull from the Cattle Market to its outlet into the northern high level sewer at 53 Ashburton Grove. The London Bridge sewer (Pitfield Street Branch) was overfull in Coleman Street by St. Paul's Street and in New North Road by Shepperton Road. The sewer in Holloway Road from Highbury Brewery to the Great Northern Railway Bridge was overfull, and the sewer under the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway was also overfull, the water at Crouch Hill Railway Station rising to a height of 5 ft. 9 in. above the level of the rails. The ventilator over the London County Council's Holloway Storm Relief Sewer, opposite No. 23, Lowman Road, was lifted from its brickwork bed by the force of the water in the sewer and large quantities of water were ejected into the road. A scheme was prepared by the Surveyor for the construction of an intercepting sewer which should take the storm water from the north-eastern part of Upper Holloway and discharge it into the London County Council's Holloway Relief Sewer in Holloway Road by Fairbridge Road. The Works Committee called the attention of the Main Drainage Committee of the Council to the matter representing the frequency of the flooding of the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway and asking whether the Council would permit the proposed intercepting sewer being connected with that Sewer. The Main Drainage Committee of the Council, however, replied that they were of opinion that the connection would increase the risk of flooding in the neighbourhood of Highbury, Kingsland, and Dalston where their sewer becomes surcharged in times of heavy rain, and that until some further provision for the drainage of the high and middle level areas is made it would be injudicious to sanction it. It follows therefore that until some action is taken by the London County Council for the drainage of the areas referred to this part of the parish will be liable to flooding when heavy storms occur. BUILDING AND DRAINAGE NOTICES. Plans and notices have been submitted to the Vestry under and pursuant to the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts in respect of the drainage of the following buildings, &c., in the parish:— Houses 317 Shops 67 54 Stables and Coach-houses 18 Additions 31 Schools 1 Sheds and Lofts 3 Warehouses and Workshops 13 Factories 1 Salvation Army Citadels 1 Stores 3 Baths 1 Cricket Pavilions 1 Offices 3 Public Conveniences 2 Dairies 1 Slaughter-houses 1 464 Notices of intention to re-drain 295 existing houses have also been received. In connection with the drainage of new and existing buildings 224 trapped and 22 untrapped connections have been made with brick sewers, 65 junctions with pipe sewers formed, and 274 feet of 9 inch, and 6,962 feet of 6 inch pipe drains (making in all a total of 359 outlet drains) have been laid under the public ways of the parish. These works were carried out at private expense the cost of the work, amounting to £1,177 18s. 9d., having been first deposited with the Vestry by the parties interested in accordance with estimates prepared by the Surveyor. 506 houses have been drained or re-drained at private expense; the work in connection therewith, which included the laying of 322 feet of 9-inch, 29,952 feet of 6-inch, and 12,106 feet of 4-inch glazed stoneware pipes, the construction of 89 inspection chambers, the fixing of 55 intercepting traps, 246 ventilating pipes, 456 closet pans, and 998 trapped gullies having been carried out under the supervision of the Surveyor. 55 The approximate cost of this work was £5,689 10s. DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The following statement shews the nett cost of the collection and disposal of house refuse and road sweepings during the year:— Gross expenditure £23,954 14 10 Credit. Amounts received by the sale of ashes, breeze, sand, horses and carts, and the removal of trade refuse £1,357 6 3 Cartage, smith's and wheelwright's work in repairing tools and water vans in connection with the repair and watering of the roads 2,850 2 11 Cartage and disposal of sludge from sewers and gullies, and repairing tools 334 4 5 Work done in connection with public lamps 2 0 0 4,543 13 7 £19,411 1 3 The cost last year amounted to £17,716 or £1,695 0s. 8d. less. The increased cost of the work this year is due to an advance in the wages of the dustmen, to the larger quantities of material collected and to the necessity for hiring of horses during an epidemic of influenza amongst the Vestry's horses. The excess indeed would have been greater but for the fact that during a portion of the year when the largest quantities of house refuse were being collected the freightage was less than during the previous year, viz., Is. 8d. instead of 2s. Id. per ton. The amount paid for freightage and for shoots for house and trade refuse and road sweepings was £4,022 16s. 4d., a decrease of £404 13s. 4d. on the previous year. 56 A larger quantity of ashes and breeze has been sold, the receipts amounting to £255. 13s. lOd. an increase of £41. 15s. 2d. over the preceding year. The receipts for the sale of sand amounted to £442. 8s. l0d. as against £542. 5s. 6d. last year. The average cost per load for the collection and disposal of house and trade refuse snow and road sweepings was nearly 3s. ll½d., as against 4s. 1d. for the year 1889-90. 42,745 loads of house refuse were removed during the year as against 37,986 loads during the preceding year. The annexed table gives the particulars of the quantities removed. In consequence of the severe frost which continued with but few abatements from 6th December, 1890, to 21st January, 1891, and the consequent demands upon the horses and carts for removing snow and for carting sand the removal of house refuse was necessarily retarded. The quantity of material to be removed was from the same cause—the cold weather—largely increased. All the vehicles which could be obtained were hired and the removal proceeded with very rapidly after the breaking up of the frost, but notwithstanding these measures five weeks elapsed before the work could be reduced to the normal amount. The excessive strain which was thrown upon the staff will be seen by the following table showing the quantities of house refuse removed during corresponding periods for the last five vears. The number of horses hired would represent 760½ davs' work for one horse. The cost amounted to £350. 9s. 6d.

In order to remove this additional horses and vans had to be hired at a cost of £163. 19s. 6d.; the number would represent 329¾ days' work for one horse. The quantity of slop and sweepings removed from the roads during the year was 53,266 loads (of which 7,638 loads consisted of snow), or 6,414 loads more than last year; 21,325 loads of this material and 1,275 loads of sludge from the sewers and gullies were passed through the wash mills, and the sand resulting from this work sold or used upon the roads. The following quantities were disposed of during the year :— 4,468 cubic yards sold 447 10 10 1,651 „ „ used on the roads 82 11 0 £530 1 10 During November and December, 1890, many of the Vestry's horses were attacked by influenza but owing to the great care taken in isolating the sick only two died. As many were, however, rendered unfit for use it became necessary to hire as before stated in order to carry on the work of the department. This hire cost £118. 7s. Od. The number of horses in stock at Lady Day was 85 horses and 2 cobs. Fifteen horses were purchased during the year at a cost of £1,042. 10s. Od. 18 horses were sold for £152. 3s. 2d., their average term of work having been 41 years. OPEN SPACES. Recreation Ground, corner of Thorniiill & Richmond Roads. The work connected with the laying out of this ground, referred to in the annual report of last year, has been completed at a total cost of 59 £800 17s. 9d. The ground which has been named Thornhill Gardens was opened to the public by Mrs. Barlow, the wife of the Vicar on 16th May, 1890. Other Open Spaces. Stoke Newington Green, Islington Green, Canonbury Square Gardens, Barnsbury Square Gardens, Thornhill Gardens, Edward Square Gardens, and the enclosures in Caledonian Road and Goswell Road, have been maintained as open spaces at the following expense:— £ s. d. Labor and keepers' wages 433 15 10 Keeper's Uniforms 25 6 0 Seeds, plants, manure, tools, repairs, &c. New seats and keeper's lodge 223 3 2 Water and rent of meters 32 19 8 £715 4 8 The band of the parish school played on several Saturday afternoons during the summer in the gardens at Islington Green. The parish churchyard is also maintained as an open space by the churchwardens at the expense of the Vestry under and pursuant to the Open Spaces Acts. DRINKING FOUNTAINS. A new drinking fountain, presented by "Thomas Ayling," a resident in the parish and "a total abstainer for 85 years" (so runs the inscription on the fountain), has been fixed by the Metropolitan Drinking Fountains and Cattle Troughs Association on the south-east side of Camden Road by the west side of Caledonian Road. 60 CHAPEL-OF-EASE GROUNDS. The wn,ll surrounding these grounds has now been removed and iron railings substituted much to the advantage of the neighbourhood. This improvement is mainly duo to the senior churchwarden for the year, Mr. G. S. Elliott. In the early part of 1 1890 as stated in the last report the Vestry Clerk was directed, subject. to the consent of the Vicar being first given, to apply to the Home Secretary for an order entirely closing these grounds for burial purposes and, upon such order being obtained, to apply to the Bishop of London for a faculty to enable the Vestry to lay the ground out as a Public Recreation Ground under and pursuant to the Metropolitan Open Spaces Act. In July, 1890, the Vicar made a statement to the Vestry to the effect that with regard to the Chapel-of-Ease grounds he was anxious to follow exactly the course pursued on the occasion of the planting and laying out of the parish churchyard some lew years ago and asked to be furnished with plans shewing how the ground is to be laid out, intimating that on receiving such plans and proposals he would give a final answer which he hoped might be favourable. Nothing further having been heard of the matter the Vestry in December, 1890, requested the Churchwardens to prepare plans and after having obtained the approval of the Vicar to submit them to the Vestry with an estimate of the cost of carrying them out. At Lady Day, 1891, the matter was still in the hands of the Churchwardens. HIGHBURY FIELDS. In the last annual report it was mentioned that Highbury Lodge with some live acres of land adjoining Highbury Fields had been sold by public auction for £12,000. In October, 1890, a communication was received from the agents of the purchasers of the estate offering to 61 sell a portion of it (comprising about 2 acres) overlooking Highbury Fields for the sum of £8,750. This price was in the opinion of the Vestry so excessive that no notice was taken of the offer. The matter was again brought under the notice of the Vestry in February, 1891, by a rumour that the Metropolitan Asylums Board contemplated purchasing the portion of the estate in question with a view to the erection thereon of a Fever Hospital. The Vestry as representing the ratepayers of the parish strongly protested against this proposal, and the idea was ultimately abandoned. The residents in the neighbourhood (being under the circumstances more anxious than ever to preserve the portion of the estate facing the fields with the fine old elms thereon) subsequently attended by deputation before the Vestry and presented a numerously signed memorial urging the Vestry to take such steps as it might deem advisable to secure to the parish and the metropolis the two acres referred to. The memorial has been referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report and is still under its consideration. REVISION OF BY-LAWS AND REGULATIONS. It was briefly mentioned in the last annual report that a special Committee had been appointed for the purpose of revising the By-Laws and Regulations of the Vestry. The Committee met no less than twenty-three times, and its report, which will be found in the Appendix, was taken into consideration at special meetings of the Vestry held on the 30th May and the 13th and 27th June, 1890, with the result that the whole of the recommendations contained therein were approved and adopted. As will be seen from the report several important changes in the practice of the Vestry were brought about by the adoption of the new By-Laws, the most important departure being the appointment of a Works Committee to take the place of the then existing Highways, Sewers and Buildings, Lighting and Dusting and Slopping Committees. Various other provisions were also made, viz., for the 62 printing of the Vestry Minutes, the regulation of questions, the appointment of Special Committees and other bodies, the closure, preventing the obstruction of business, and for ensuring open tendering, all of which will it is hoped tend towards efficiency and dispatch of business. WORKS COMMITTEE AND THE DIVISION OF THE PARISH INTO DISTRICTS. The Works Committee created under the By-Laws just referred to suggested some important changes prominent among which were the appointment of one Surveyor-in-chief, the division of the Parish into three districts for the regulation and control of its highways, sewers and lighting, and the appointment of a Sub-Committee and Assistant Surveyor for the immediate control of the work in each district. The districts are as follows:—the northern comprising the ward of Upper Holloway, the south-eastern comprising Highbury, Canonbury, St. Peters and part of St. Mary's Ward, and the southwestern comprising Lower Holloway, Thornhill, Barnsbury and the remaining portion of St. Mary's Ward. This change, the necessity for which had been some time felt, should certainly tend to greater efficiency. PRINTING OF VESTRY MINUTES. Another important feature connected with the revision was the introduction of a By-Law (No. 13) which provided that the minutes of each meeting of the Vestry should be printed and a copy thereof sent to each Vestryman with the notice of the next ordinary meeting. Although a somewhat costly innovation, the advantage to members of the Vestry and to the staff of having in their own hands for reference a printed record of the proceedings, and the saving of time which was formerly occupied in reading the minutes, may be said to justify the expenditure. 63 CONTRACTS. The following is a statement of the contracts which have been entered into, or were in existence, during the year ended Ladyday 1891. Date of Contract. Name and Address of Contractor.

In January last the Vestry received a communication from Sir Albert Rollit, M.P., inquiring whether it desired that the "Shows" Bill drafted by the Vestry Clerk some two years since should be again introduced into Parliament. The Vestry it will be remembered had in January, 1889, requested the Borough members to introduce a short Bill providing summary powers for the suppression of all shows, fairs, &c., conducted so as to be a nuisance to a neighbourhood on the ground that the statutory powers possessed both by it and the police were inadequate to deal effectively with exhibitions and shows held on private land. The Vestry Clerk had drafted the Bill and forwarded it to Sir Albert Rollit, who, however, had been unable hitherto to introduce it with any chance of success. The Vestry being still of opinion that local authorities should have more specific powers than are at present possessed by them for dealing with the subject requested Sir Albert Rollit to proceed with the Bill. The Bill was accordingly introduced, but at Lady Day there seemed little hope of its becoming law. In June, 1890, the Vestry directed its Solicitor to indict the owner for permitting, and a man named Thurston for conducting, shows on a piece of waste ground adjoining the "Pocock Arms" tavern, Roman Road. An arrangement was subsequently come to, however, by which the shows were removed. In November, 1890, the Vestry thought it desirable to take precautions against the re-establishment of the shows which had for years been the annoyance of the High Street during the holding of the Cattle Show. Notices were exhibited in the neighbourhood cautioning shopkeepers and others that the Vestry would take proceedings should any such show be re-established, and the Solicitor to the Vestry was directed to inform the occupiers of those houses against whom an injunction had been obtained that if they ignored such injunction committal warrants would be at once applied for. 65 VESTRY HALL (ALTERATIONS TO). The attention of the Vestry having been drawn to the desirability of providing living accommodation above ground for the Vestry Hallkeeper and his wife, the subject was referred to the Greneral Purposes Committee for consideration and report. The Committee, after consulting the Vestry's Surveyor, recommended the Vestry to provide sleeping accommodation consisting of two bedrooms over the new Committee room. The Committee's proposal was adopted by the Vestry and the work carried out at a cost of £244 11s. 0d. In February last the Vestry had under consideration, on a report from its General Purposes Committee, the desirability of repairing and renovating the Vestry Hall and Offices. The Committee recommended that the whole of the building (external and internal) should be thoroughly cleaned and renovated, that various repairs and alterations should be carried out, and that provision should be made for the better ventilation of the premises throughout. The Vestry decided to carry out the work, at an estimated cost of £750. The question of providing extra strong room accommodation in the building was also brought under the notice of the Vestry. The need of better provision in this respect has been felt for a very long time and the Vestry resolved to incorporate with the existing strongroom four small rooms adjoining thus affording the required accommodation. The cost of this alteration was estimated at £200. The provision of better accommodation for the increased staff of the Works Department being also in contemplation, the Greneral Purposes Committee, after conferring with the Chairman of the Works Committee and the Surveyor, reported in favor of a scheme by which among other matters the Burial Board should by requested to vacate its present office on the ground floor. This, however, did not meet with the approval of the Vestry, and the report was referred back for re-consideration. Whatever alterations may be determined on will, it is hoped. be carried out during the vacation. E 66 INSURANCE OF VESTRY MALL AND OFFICES. The General Purposes Committee took into consideration in November last the question of the Insurance of the Vestry Hall and Offices together with their contents against loss by lire. Several important alterations and additions had been made to the premises since the last Insurance for £11,000 was effected, and the Committee gave directions for a Policy to be taken out for the sum of £20,220, including furniture, heating apparatus, books, maps, &c., and one year's rent of the premises. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES. The Commissioners for Public Baths and Washhouses, a list of whom will be found on page 9, have not been idle since their appointment. On the 29th April, 1890, they obtained the approval of the Vestry to the purchase of a portion of the site formerly occupied by the Great Northern Hospital, with an area of about 17,000 superficial feet a frontage of 121 feet to the Caledonian Road and return frontages in Stanmore Street and Free,ling Street, for the proposed south-western baths and washhouses for 1 he sum of £7,500. Owing, however, to legal delays the purchase was not completed until January, 1891. Meantime designs for the proposed baths had been advertised for, that of Mr. A. H. Tiltman of 70 Torrington Square being selected upon the advice of a competent Architectural Assessor out of twelve sent in for competition. In March, 1891, the tender of Mr. J. O. Richardson for the erection of baths and washhouses in accordance with Mr. Tiltman's designs for the sum of £14,933 was accepted, and the buildings are now in course of erection. On the 14th November, 1890, the Commissioners secured the approval of the Vestry to the purchase of the freehold and leasehold interests in the site known as Devonshire House, Hornsey Road, for the proposed northern baths and washhouses, for the sum of £6,000. The purchase was not, however, actually completed within the year with which t his report deals. As this site contains over two and-a-half acres 67 of land, with a frontage of 132 feet to the Hornsey Road and a right of way from the Seven Sisters' Road, the Commissioners are to be congratulated upon its acquisition. It may therefore be expected that early in 1892 two distinct sets of baths and washhouses, one for the northern and the other for the south-western portions of the parish, will be thrown open for public use. The first abstract of accounts published by the Commissioners, covering the period from their original appointment in November, 1889, to Lady Day, 1891, will be found in the appendix. CHURCHWARDENS' EXPENDITURE. The attention of the Vestry was again drawn to the question of the Churchwardens' expenditure, and a special committee, consisting of twenty members of the Vestry, together with the three Churchwardens for the time being was appointed on the 17th October, 1890. This committee was directed to take into consideration the resolutions of the Vestry of October 23rd and 30th, 1874, the manner in which those resolutions had been carried into effect and any other matters bearing upon the relations between the Vestry and the Churchwardens, and to report whether any, and if so what, changes were desirable. The committee at a special meeting of the Vestry held on the 23rd January presented a lengt hy report a copy of which will be found in the Appendix. The report was received by the Vestry and the recommendations therein approved with one or two minor exceptions. It was for instance resolved that in addition to visitation fees insurance of Church Bells and expenses of registers of a later date than the year 1837, no expenses in connection with the admission of Churchwardens beyond the fees allowed by law nor any expense of or occasioned by the appointment or election of officers for the Parish Church and Chapel-of-Ease respectively should in future be paid for out of the rates. The resolutions of the Vestry of October 30th, 1874, were rescinded as recommended by the committee, and there is every reason to believe E—2 68 that the adoption of the report has placed the relations between the Vestry and Churchwardens on a more satisfactory and workable basis than they have hitherto been. The thanks of the Vestry were tendered to the Chairman of the special committee (Dr. Buckell) for the very able and impartial manner in which he presided over the deliberations of the committee, and for the interest taken by him in investigating the past history of the relations between the Churchwardens and the Vestry. REGISTRATION OF PARLIAMENTARY VOTERS. The revision of the County and Borough Lists occupied five days, and took place at the Vestry Hall in September, 1890. Particulars of the Borough Registration are given below. DIVISIONS AND WARDS. 1890. Rated Occupiers. Registered Occupiers. North Division. Ward 1, Upper Holloway 11,400 9,510 East Division. Ward 3, Highbury 11,400 9,376 „ 7, Canonbury West Division. Ward 2, Lower Holloway 8,300 6,851 „ 4, Thornhill South Division. Ward 5, Barnsbury 9,200 7,029 „ 6, St. Mary „ 8, St. Peter's Total 40,300 32,766 MORTUARY. As no reference to the Mortuary appears in the last annual report the omission is here rectified. 69 633 bodies were received into the Mortuary and 351 inquests held during the year ended Lady Day, 1890, the fees for which amounted to £54. 720 bodies were received and 437 inquests held during the past year, the fees for which amounted to £65. 15s. REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. 29 and 30 Vic. Cap. 30. There are now 311 houses on the Register 16 of those previously on having been pulled down during the past year. DISORDERLY HOUSES. One warrant was obtained against the keeper of a disorderly house, which however remained unexecuted at Lady Day the house having been meantime closed. Notices were served on the occupiers of sixty-one houses of which complaints had been received with the result that most of them were vacated without a resort to legal proceedings. Two claims were made upon the Vestry for the informer's fee of £10 in connection with the prosecution and conviction in June, 1889, of James Leary for keeping No. 31 Palmerston Road as a brothel. These claims were paid. The fact that no convictions have been obtained during the year is doubtless due to the unwillingness of ratepayers to come forward and produce evidence as required by Act of Parliament. As mentioned in the last annual report of the Vestry, this procedure is necessary before the Vestry can incur any expense in legal proceedings. TELEPHONE EXCHANGE. With a view to facilitate the work of the staff the Vestry has caused its offices be placed upon the Telephone Exchange the subscription being £20 per annum. The Vestry's Telephone No. is 7,649. 70 METROPOLIS WATER SUPPLY. The important question of the Water Supply of London received considerable attention at the hands of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis during the year. A communication was received in June, 1890, from the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, forwarding copy of a report on the subject and inviting the Vestry to appoint three delegates to a conference to consider the whole subject. The principal quest ion for considerat ion was the desirability of inviting Her Majesty's Government to introduce a Bill into Parliament to confer power upon the London County Council for the acquisition by compulsion of the several Water Companies' undertakings or the establishment of a competing supply and to require the Companies to supply water by meter at a fixed tariff. The General Purposes Committee, to whom this letter was referred, appointed Messrs. Hodson, Lavy and May as delegates to the conference. At the first meeting of the conference, which was held in St. James's Vestry Hall on the 19th June, resolutions were passed affirming these points, and also expressing an opinion that the Water Companies should be restrained from increasing their charges in accordance with the Quinquennial Valuat ion then in progress. A deputation waited upon the President of the Local Government Board in support of these resolutions on the 11th July, but that gentleman pointed out that in face of the enquiry already instituted by (he City Corporation and that contemplated by the London County Council it would not be desirable for him to take any steps in t he matter. The Conference accordingly decided on behalf of the Vestries and District Boards to give notice of and prepare a Bill for the purchase of the Water Companies' undertakings. An Executive Committee consisting of one representative from each Vestry and District Board taking part in this Conference was appointed to take the necessary steps for promoting the Bill, Mr. James May representing Islington thereon. The Vestry being impressed with the importance of a final settlement of the water question being effected has not only petitioned in favor of the Hill but has cont ributed the sum of £100 0s. 0d. *towards the expenses of its promotion. * This contribution has since been increased to £150. 71 The Bill has been referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons. LONDON COAL AND WINE DUES. The Act abolishing these dues became law in 1889 notwithstanding the protests of the Vestry of Islington and many other of the local authorities of the Metropolis. Several communications have recently been received from these authorities in favor of the re-imposition of the dues. It is beyond dispute that their abolition has not benefited the consumer in the slightest degree. It has on the other hand undoubtedly increased the burdens of the already over-taxed ratepayer. The Vestry, therefore, on the recommendation of its General Purposes Committee passed a resolution in favor of the re-imposition of the dues, and appointed delegates to a conference proposed to be convened by the Vestry of Kensington with a view to some joint action being taken to obtain this result. INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF HYGIENE AND DEMOGRAPHY. In February last the Vestry received a communication from Sir Douglas Galton, K.C.B., Chairman of the Organising Committee, calling attention to the seventh International Congress of Hygiene and Demography which would assemble in London under the presidency of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, in August, 1891, and expressing a hope that the Vestry would nominate delegates to attend the Congress. The letter was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, and the Vestry on the recommendation of that Committee appointed Dr. Wynne Westcott and Dr. Smyth delegates to attend the said Congress. CITY OF LONDON PAROCHIAL CHARITIES ACT, 1883. Northern Technical Recreative Institute. Referring to the last annual report it may be well to state that the site in the Holloway Road was purchased in July last and that the 72 purchase met with the Charity Commissioners' approval. This site being in the centre of Islington is easily accessible from all parts of the parish, as well as from Highgate and Hornsey. A declaration of trust has been executed permanently securing the property for the purposes designed. The Central Scheme for the administration of the City of London Parochial Charities' Act, 1883, obtained the sanction of Parliament in February last. Under the Local Taxation (Customs and Excise) Act, 1890, a sum of £743,200, arising from the Beer and Spirit duties was granted by Parliament to the County Councils and Boroughs of England and Wales upon the understanding that it should be used by them for the purposes of Technical education. Of this sum the London County Council received last year £163,000. How this handsome grant will be employed is yet conjectural, but it is understood that in the provinces the interests of education are considered as paramount. The erection of the Northern Technical and Recreative Institute will, it is evident, require much larger funds than are likely to be raised by voluntary effort in the district, and it is to be hoped that the Council may see its way to apportion some part of the grant in question to this object. University Extension Lectures. Under the circumstances referred to in the report for last year the Committee which had the local control of these lectures has found it necessary, though with much regret, to abandon them. The origin of the movement in Islington, including the Vestry's association with it, will be found in the report for 1888-89. The peculiar conditions of the parish with its numerous churches and chapels—each the nucleus to some extent of an intellectual centre—have no doubt certain advantages, but these conditions do not favor outside and independent efforts of a class which are necessarily dependent for success upon united action over a large area. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Morley v. Gable. This was an action of trespass brought at the Clerkenwell County Court by the plaintiff, a ratepayer, against the defendant, who is a 73 broker employed by Mr. Camp, one of the rate collectors, to execute levies of distress when necessary. The grounds of the action were that the plaintiff was not the legal occupier of the house (5, Ashbrook Road) in respect of which the rates were due, and further that the warrant itself was invalid by reason of the broker's name not having been inserted therein. As the latter point was one of moment to the Vestry the Solicitor was instructed to defend the action in which the plaintiff was non-suited. Elliott (Churchwarden) v. The Vestry. It will have been seen by the last annual report that the Vestry had requested the senior Churchwarden to invite tenders for taking down the wall surrounding the Chapel-of-Ease grounds and erecting iron railings in lieu thereof. In February, 1890, Mr. Churchwarden Elliott requested the Vestry to advance £500 for the purpose but this the Vestry refused to do. The Vestry's action was no doubt prompted by various motives, but prominent among them was the idea that such an expenditure would be illegal as involving a contravention of the Church Rates Abolition Act, the freehold of the Chapel-of-Ease being vested in the Vicar. Mr. Elliott, however, relying upon his powers under the Burials Act Amendment Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vic., c. 128) and the responsibility thereby cast upon him as Churchwarden for the proper maintenance of the Chapel-of-Ease ground, proceeded with the work, and in July, 1890, after having again requested the Vestry to advance the money in vain, took proceedings to enforce what he considered to be his legal rights. A rule nisi having been obtained against the Vestry to show cause why a peremptory mandamus should not issue to compel the payment of the said sum of £500, it was argued before Baron Pollock and Mr. Justice A. L. Smith on July 10th, the plaintiff beingrepresented by the Attorney-General and Mr. McCall, and the Vestry by Mr. Henn Collins, Q.C., and Mr. V. Austen. Without entering upon the numerous legal points raised on behalf of the Vestry it is sufficient here to say that the Court overruled them and directed the Vestry to pay the money, being evidently much impressed by the provisions of the Burial Act of 1855 before referred to. This unfortunate dispute cost the Vestry £127 10s. 0d., exclusive of the untaxed costs of the senior Churchwardens, particulars of which will be found in his account annexed. 74 Eayres v. Chisnell. This action by a former ratepayer against one of the rate collectors arose, as did the proceedings under the same heading mentioned in the last annual report, out of the arrest of the plaintiff by the defendant in March, 1889, under a warrant of committal for non-payment of rates. It will be remembered that Mr. Chisnell was himself committed to prison at the instance of the plaintiff for contempt of court. The present action was brought some sixteen months after to recover damages for the same offence, if Mr. Chisnell's inadvertence can be so called. The Vestry, as a matter of course after its action on the previous occasion, instructed its Solicitor to enter an appearance to the writ on behalf of Mr. Chisnell, but up to the date with which this report deals no attempt has been made by the plaintiff to bring the matter to an issue. Various. The following prosecutions were instituted at the Police Courts under the several Acts set forth:— GENERAL PAYING (METROPOLIS) ACT, 1817.

PARLIAMENTARY. The following acts of metropolitan or local interest passed during the session of 1890:— Open Spaces Act.—This act inter alia provides (Sec. 3) that the trustees of land held upon trust for the purposes of public recreation may transfer the said land to the local authority absolutely or for a limited time. Working Classes Dwellings Act.—The object of this Act is to facilitate gifts of land for dwellings for the working classes in populous places. Metropolis Management Act (1862) Amendment Act.—This Act repeals Sec. 78 of 25 and 26 Vic., cap. 102, and enacts that Vestries and District Boards may henceforth recover the 79 expenses of flagging the footpaths referred to in such section from the owners of property abutting thereon. This repeal of one of the anomalies which are to be met with in the Metropolis Management Act had been for years advocated by the Vestry, as will be seen by a reference to the report for 1886-7. At the Vestry's instance Mr. McCullagh Torrens, the late member for the old Borough of Finsbury, and the Metropolitan Board of Works had introduced Bills with a view of getting rid of the anomaly, but both had failed. Great credit is therefore due to Mr. T. H. Bolton (who by-the-bye was formerly a member of the Islington Vestry) for his efforts in promoting the Bill and for his energy and ability in safely piloting it through the two Houses of Parliament. Metropolis Management Amendment Act.—This Act by Sec. 3 enacts that Vestries may repair "new streets" without prejudicing their powers to afterwards put the provisions of Sec. 105 of 18 and 19 Vic. cap. 120 in force; and, by Sec. 6, that subsoil under a street is not to be removed without the consent of Vestry or District Board. Public Libraries Acts Amendment Act.—This—one of many amending Acts—-provides that the mode of ascertaining the opinion of ratepayers shall be by voting papers only, and deals also with the provisions of the earlier Acts limiting the amount of rate. Customs and Inland Revenue Act.—This Act is of interest to local authorities, inasmuch as by Sec. 26 (2) it provides that upon a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health of the parish to the effect that a house built for the purpose of providing separate dwellings is adequately constructed for the purpose (the rent of each such dwelling not being more than 7s. 6d. per week) the inhabited house duty skall be discharged. Housing of the Working Classes Act.—This important Act, which repeals the various Labouring Classes Dwelling Houses Acts and the whole of the Artizans and Laborers Dwelling Acts, consolidating and amending their provisions, is divided into seven parts. 80 Part I. deals with unhealthy areas on a large scale, the County Council being the authority for putting it in force. The Medical Officer of Health of any parish may, however, make a representation as regards an unheathy area in his district to the County Council. Part II. deals more particularly with buildings unfit for human habitation and obstructive buildings, and under it the Vestry is in Islington the local authority. The Medical Officer of health is bound to make a representation to the local authority if any dwelling house appears to him so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and any four or more householders living near an unhealthy house may set the Medical Officer of Health in motion. The local authority is moreover bound to cause inspections of its district to be made periodically, and upon such a representation as is before alluded to or upon information given the local authority if any house appears to them to be unfit for human habitation is bound to take proceedings for closing it. This part of the Act contains numerous clauses directing subsequent proceedings on the part of the local authority, and gives it power as a last resource to order the demolition of such house or houses. Power is also given to the local authority to deal in a similar manner with what are termed obstructive buildings, by which is to be understood buildings which although they may not themselves be unfit for human habitation either stop ventilation or conduce to make other buildings unfit for human habitation. The local authority is further empowered to prepare schemes for the improvement of ill-ventilated or badly arranged blocks of houses where the areas affected are insufficient in size to be worthy the attention of the County Council under Part I. of the Act. Then follow provisions for compensation and for action by the County Council should any local authority under this part fail or neglect to do its duty. 81 Part III. deals with Working Class Lodging Houses, and the County Council is the local authority. Part IV. is mainly supplemental. It however (Sec. 76) enables the London County Council to appoint its own Medical Officers of Health, and such officers are to be deemed medical officers of any local authority under the Act. It also provides (Sec. 81) that the local authority may delegate any of its powers to a Committee subject to certain reservations. Parts V. and VI. apply to Scotland and Ireland respectively. Part VII. deals with the repeal of existing statutes and enacts certain temporary provisions. A reference to page 74 will show that the Vestry has not been backward in putting the provisions of this Act into force. Infectious Diseases Prevention Act.—This Act is the logical outcome of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act of the Session of 1889, and the terms used, including infectious disease, are to have the same meaning as in that Act. Powers are given for inspection of dairies and for if necessary prohibiting supplies of milk, for the compulsory disinfection of houses and bedding, and for prohibiting the occupation of houses unless properly disinfected and the retention of the bodies of persons who have died from infectious diseases. The Vestry is the local authority. A copy of the report of the Sanitary Committee upon this Act will be found in the Appendix. The London Council (General Powers) Act.—The only provisions of this Act which directly affect the Vestry are contained in Sees. 28 and 32. The former provides for an appeal against a decision of the Superintending Architect of the London County Council with regard to lines of frontage. The latter requires notice to be given to the Vestry or District Board of intention to build or take down any building within 10 feet of any public way, and provides for the erection of proper hoardings. F 82 The following Bills of public or local importance received the attention of the Vestry during the session. City and South London Railway Bill. In December, 1890, plans were deposited by the City and South London Railway Company for constructing a railway under City Road from the Angel to the City. The plans showed that the Company proposed constructing two lines of railway by means of tunnels under and along City Road terminating opposite Torrens Street and taking the whole of the property between the west of Duncan Terrace and the east side of Torrens Street including a portion of Torrens Street. As, however, the Bill was withdrawn before it was taken into consideration by the Vestry no action was taken in the matter. Great Northern Railway Bill. Plans were also deposited by the Great Northern Railway Company in respect of the proposed purchase by the company of Nos. 311 and 313 Holloway Road with the gardens at the front and rear of the same. The premises adjoined property already purchased by the Company for the extension of their line, and as the Bill proposed no interference with the roads footpaths or sewers under the jurisdiction of the Vestry no action was taken upon it. Public Health (London) Law Consolidation and Amendment Bills. The above Bills were introduced into Parliament towards the close of the year to which this report relates by the President of the Local Government Board. Notwithstanding that the Bills were only delivered to the House on the 13th March they were set down for second reading on the 17th, but owing to the protests of several members Mr. Ritchie was induced to consent to the second reading being postponed until the 6th April. The first named, as the memorandum thereon states, is essentially a Consolidation Bill. The amendments contained therein are of a minor character, and the provisions of existing statutes which it proposes to repeal, substituting others therefor, are so numerous, that with the time at the disposal of the Vestry it was hardly possible to devote much attention to it. 83 The Amendment Bill on the other hand contains some important alterations, not only in regard to what may be considered purely sanitary matters but affecting also the Vestry's general control of the affairs of the parish. Clause 9 proposes to enable the County Council to make Bye-Laws for various purposes, such as the removal of snow, cleansing of streets, &c., as to which the Vestry has always been the sole authority. Clauses 11 to 13 introduce some important alterations as to the conduct of offensive trades, and by clause 12 (3), it is proposed to repeal the Act of 26 Geo. III. by which the Vestry is authorised to appoint an Inspector of Houses for slaughtering Horses. Clause 13 brings the removal of house refuse and street refuse within the purview of Sec. 27 of the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, and by placing the County Council in the position of complainants practically makes the Vestries and District Boards subordinate in regard to such matters. Clauses 15 to 18 deal more particularly with scavenging, and although the duty of cleansing the footways is still primarily cast upon the occupiers, the local authorities are also to be responsible for this work, and in case of default are made liable to a penalty of £50. In addition to this, sub-clauses 2 and 3 provide that a local authority failing to remove ashes or refuse within 24 hours of a written notice by any ratepayer shall be liable upon conviction not only to a fine of £50 but to pay to such occupiers 5s. per day as and for liquidated damages. Clause 19 deals with sanitary conveniences, and here again the County Council is empowered to make Bye-Laws which the Vestries and District Boards are to observe and enforce. Clauses 24 and 25 deal with water supply and by sub-clause (2) of the former the duty is cast upon the Vestry of certifying the water supply of every house hereafter to be built or rebuilt. Clauses 26 to 32 deal with infectious diseases. The former impose upon the Vestry the duty of providing a disinfecting chamber, and clauses 28 and 29 authorise it to allow any person engaged F -2 84 in milking, fruit picking, &c., a reasonable allowance during such time as he may be prohibited from engaging in such work by reason of infectious disease. Clause 35 by sub-clause 8 introduces an important modification of the control of the Vestry over any Medical Officer or Sanitary Inspector to be hereafter appointed, which will tend to make such officers responsible rather to the local Government Board than to the Vestry. Finally by clauses 36 and 37 provision is made whereby the County Council and the Local Government Board may step in should they deem the Vestry to have failed in its duty as a Sanitary Authority under the Act and do the work at the expense of the Vestry. From the foregoing principal clauses of the Bill it will be seen that the tendency of the Bill is towards centralization, or, in other words, the subordination of the Vestries and District Boards in all sanitary matters to the London County Council and the Local Government Board. The Vestry at its meeting on March 20th, 1891, appointed a Special Committee to take these Bills into consideration, which at Lady Day was proceeding with its labours. The following Public Bills also received attention during the year:— Burials. Cheap Trains {London). County Councillors' Disabilities Removal. Electors' Registration (Acceleration). Housing of the Working Classes. London County Council (General Powers). London County Council Superannuation. London School Board Elections. Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862 Amendment.

The records of sanitary work (in accordance with the Act of Parliament) relate to the year ending March 25th, 1891. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, During the year ending 3rd January, 1891, 9,419 children were born in Islington, and 5,718 persons died. Within the same period 2,485 Marriages were celebrated. The birth-rate therefore for 1890 was 25.6 per 1,000 of the population (against 26.8 in 1889), the death-rate 15.6 (against 13.3 in 1889), and the marriage-rate 13.5 (against 13.7 in 1889). The birth-rate for 1890 is the lowest to be found in our Islington records. Since 1868, the birth-rate (which was then 39.4 per 1,000), has been steadily decreasing. The death-rate for the year has, however, shewn a slight increase, which, no doubt, is to be attributed to the extreme severity of the weather during the latter part of the year. the deaths ascribed to diseases of the Respiratory Organs and to Old Age were the highest ever recorded in the parish, whilst the number of deaths from Phthisis shew also a marked excess 92 METEOROLOGY OF 1890.

December was one of the coldest months on record, a minimum of 16º Fahrenheit having been reached. Continuous dense fogs occurred on the coldest days. 93 No. I. MARRIAGES, 1889 [and 1890]. Islington.

The death-rate of Islington during the past year has been 15.0 per 1,000 of the population (estimated population 366,520). There has been a total of 5,718 deaths recorded in the Parish, of which 2,792 were males, and 2,920 females. Of the 5,718 total deaths registered in Islington, 1,953 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1,807 in Islington South West, 1,115 in Islington South East, and 843 in Highbury. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES.

The number of deaths due to diseases of the Respiratory Organs during 1890, is the highest on recorc, the fatal cases numbering 1,406, as against 970 in 1889, 1,040 in 1888, and 1,169 in 1887. 7 SMALL POX. No death from Small Pox has been recorded during the year. MEASLES. Measles was again epidemic during the year, more especially in the months of March, April, May and June, when the deaths were respectively 28, 40, 33 and 31; the mortality in 1890 being 185, a number slightly in excess of that recorded in the year 1889 (180). WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough occasioned 200 deaths during 1890, the number being considerably above that of last year, when the deaths from this cause were exceptionally low. [The deaths from Whooping Cough were 112 in 1889, 230 in 1888, 238 in 1887, and 205 in 1886.] The number of deaths was 27 in April, 22 in May, 28 in June, and 21 in July, after which the numbers gradually decreased. SCARLET FEVER. Twenty-nine deaths only were recorded as due to Scarlet Fever (a number considerably below the average), as against 32 in 1889, and 50 in each of the vears 1888 and 1887. DIPHTHERIA. Diphtheria occasioned 47 deaths, as against 44 in 1889, 35 in 1888, 27 in 1887, and 54 in 1886. I would here remark that I have uniformly had to report an increased number of deaths from Diphtheria, when there is a decrease in the mortality from Scarlet Fever. - 08 Fever. The deaths referred to Fever generally, amounted to 35, being the lowest number ever recorded, the deaths for the three previous years being 56, <\\) and 30 respectively. DIARUHCEA. During 1800, 169 deaths were ascribed to Diarrhoea, as against 170 in 1H80, 140 in 1888,201 in 1887, and 307 in 1880. In July, August and September (when the cases were the most fatal), the numbers respectively were 30, 55 and 31 deaths. INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC. I do not propose in this report dealing with the Epidemic of Influenza, save mentioning that during the early months of the year it was both widely diffused and severe in its effects. Our knowledge of the disease when if first showed itself in January, 1800, was exceedingly limited, the present year unfortunately giving the physician a largely increased field for observation and study. I shall hope another time to discuss the epidemic so far as it relates to the special work of the sunitarian. 99 TABLE NO. V.

Od. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 7.5 per cent, for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1890-91. Table No. VIII. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, re-inspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the Inspectors generally have reported the premises from which they have found the removal of dust to be necessary on making their ordinary inspections. DISINFECTION. The practice adopted by the Sanitary Committee of carrying out the fumigation of rooms, free of cost, where infectious disease has occurred, has proved very effectual. H 104 The following table shews the number of rooms which have been fumigated by the Disinfector after cases of infectious disease, during each month of the year. Districts Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr.

Disinfecting Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway Roads, these thoroughfares being used as market-places until late on Saturday night. The Dust Bins were also disinfected by the Dustmen after removing the Dust from the houses of the inhabitants during the Summer months.

The season of 1890 was prolific in sanitary legislation. As a result, the responsibility thrown upon the officers of your Sanitary Department has become correspondingly greater and more exacting. I shall merely in this report indicate the five statutes, to the precise working of which it will be my duty hereafter to direct your attention in detail. The Sanitary Committee have been fully informed of all the changes indicated, and have devoted much time and attention to their consideration. I. Customs and Inland Revenue Act (53 and 54 Vic. cap. 8).— By a section of this Act (section 26) certain money advantages are offered to the owners of artizans dwellings, provided efficient sanitary appliances are adopted. The Act has occasioned a great deal of extra labour to the Department, the Medical Officer of Health in this particular having to determine how far due provisions have been made. II. The Housing of the Working Classes Act (53 and 54 Vic., cap. 16) is by far the most important of the Acts that were passed in 1890. It is too early to pass a judgment on so complicated a piece of legislation, repealing amongst others (entirely or in part), Cross's Act, Torren's Act, with the amendments, the Labouring Classes Dwelling Act (1851, 1866, 1877), and the Housing of the Working Classes Act (1885). The Act abolishes the duties of the surveyor which were defined under Torren's Act. It gives power to the County Health Officer to report an unhealthy area (Part 1., section 5). A dwelling house which appears to the Medical Officer of Health to be dangerous or injurious to health may be closed, by order of the Magistrate, and provided the private opinion of the Magistrate coincides with that of the Health Officer ; houses may be demolished, and obstructive buildings (not in themselves being unhealthy) dealt with the Act providing for proper compensation in such cases to owners. H 2 106 III. Working Classes Dwellings Act (53 and 54 Vic., cap. 16).— This Act exempts gifts of land under live acres by deed or will under certain conditions from the operation of Parts I. and II. of the Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act (1888). IV. Public Health Acts Amendment Act (53 and 54 Vic., cap. 59), V. Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act (53 and 54 Vic., cap. 34.) —This Act came into force in the Metropolis from and after December 4tn, 1890. It contains a complicated section (section 4), giving power to the Medical Officer of Health to deal with a milk supply which he has reason to believe is causing infectious disease within his district. It also contains certain clauses relating to disinfection (sections 5 and 6), the occupation of infected rooms (section 7), the burial and removal of infectious and other corpses (sections 8, 9, 10, 11), and other excellent provisions. THE SLAUGHTER AND COW-HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1890-91. At the Annual Licensing in October, 1890, there were 75 applications for the renewal of licenses to Slaughter-houses, the whole of which were granted. For the renewal of licenses to Cow-houses, 33 applications were made and the whole were granted. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending 25th March, 1891, fifty-eight summonses were issued by direction of the Sanitary Committee. Of this number forty-five were taken out under the "Sale of Food and Drugs Acts " (upon certificates given by the Public Analyst; against the vendors of adulterated articles. In thirty-nine of these cases the prosecutions were successful, the penalties ranging from 1s. to £2 with costs in each case. Of the six remaining cases, four were dismissed on points of law, whilst one summons was withdrawn. In the remaining case, the delendant absconded before the summons could be served. 107 Ten summonses were taken out under the "Nuisances Removal Act" and one under the "Sanitary Act." With the exception of one case (which was dismissed upon the informality of the notice), all the prosecutions were successful. In only one case, however, was a penalty inflicted, i.e., for disobedience to an order of the Magistrate. Two summonses were also taken out under the "Housing of the Working Classes Act," 1890. Both these cases proved successful, closing orders being obtained in each instance. The total penalties received and paid into the Vestry during the year in respect of the above proceedings, amounted to £40 10s. I now append a detailed statement of the foregoing cases.

The seven houses closed (in Elliott's Place, Essex Road) as unfit for human habitation in 1884, by order of the Magistrate, still remain unoccupied, no attempt having been made to render them fit for habitation. With regard to the 52 houses (known as Concord Buildings, Norfolk Court, Norfolk Square, Norfolk Gardens, Lindsey Cottages, and several houses in the Morton and Ecclesbourne Roads), which I reported in 1888 to the London County Council as an area for an improvement scheme under the Act of 1875, the Council, in January of the present year, referred this matter back to the Vestry, requesting it to take into consideration the possibility of applying their increased powers under Part II. of the "Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890," for the improvement of these buildings. I am of opinion, however, that it would not be advisable at present to deal with this area under either Part I. or Part II. of the Act. 111 REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. (29 & 30 Vic., cap. 30, sec. 35, & 37 & 33 Vic., cap. 89, sec. 47.) Of the 327 houses upon the register, 16 in the Holloway Road (Palmer Terrace), are at the present time being demolished. The remaining 311 houses have been regularly inspected during the year and the regulations duly enforced. About 165 notices were served for non-compliance with the regulations, but in no instance was it found necessary to take legal proceedings in order to enforce the carrying out of the same. THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1890-91. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. IX.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-day, 1891, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 11,488 applications received from residents during the year, 8,208 were by Letter or Post Card, and 3,280 by personal application at the Vestry Offices. The 11,488 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 26.9 per cent, of the 42,708 assessments in the Parish, as against 18.6 per cent, in 1889. CONCLUSION. A new Sanitary Bill (a more or less complete Consolidation Act) will probably have become Law within a short period of this report being in your hands. It introduces many changes, not the least of which will consist in a transference of some of your powers to new bodies, 112 thereby, I fear, lessening your influence as the Sanitary Authority of a district. I should be wanting in courage if I did not express my opinion definitely that at any rate your Vestry have never within my experience acted as a barrier to sanitary reform. Whatever may be the state of things in other parishes (and of this I confess myself ignorant), I can honestly say that during the 20 years I have been your officer, you have always shewn yourself willing (sometimes I may have thought too hastily desirous) to adopt suggestions for the sanitary improvement of your district. It will be our dutv no doubt to make certain changes in our work and sanitary machinerv, when the Bill now under the consideration of Parliament becomes an Act. Judging by the experience of the past year, during which the energy of your Sanitary Superintendent, and the excellent work of your Inspectors have made themselves specially manifest, I feel confident that all will combine to carry out the new Act with efficiency and discretion, and at the same time with loyalty to the Vestry as the Sanitary Authority of the Parish. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B. 30th June, 1891. 113 114 TABLE No. VII. DEATHS REGISTERED IN ISLINGTON DURING FIFTY-THREE WEEKS ENDING 3rd JANUARY, 1891.

Report of the Public Analyst appointed for the Parish, of St. Mary, Islington, upon the Articles Analysed by him under the above Acts during the Quarter ending the 30th September, 1890. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, I have, during the last quarter, analysed and reported on 129 samples of Food and Drugs taken under the above Acts. Of these samples 128 were submitted to me by your Inspectors, and one sample by a private purchaser. Nine of the samples were adulterated, these being Milk, Whisky, Rum and Cocoa. The percentage of adulterated samples would probably be much higher if your Inspectors were to purchase by agents instead of personally. I think the Vestry is to be congratulated on its staff of Inspectors; but an Inspector, however excellent, in time becomes known. The individual fines are still small in amount, and I would venture to suggest to the Vestry the advisability of combining with other Metropolitan Vestries to influence the Home Office or the Local Government Board to take the matter up. It would in my opinion be extremely inadvisable to accede to the recent request of the London County Council for information. It looks too much like the thin edge of the wedge to deprive the Vestries of the legitimate control of their own officers. The work would be much better in the hands cf the Local Government Board, who have the advantage over the London County Council of having returns from the whole of the Kingdom in addition to those from the Metropolis. I would also point out that at present the Vestries are deprived from officially examining the gas supplied to themselves and their ratepayers, this duty being nominally in the hands of the London County Council, who have, however, very little real control; their main duty being to pay the Gas Examiners, and even this they do badly.

"THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875." Report of the Public Analyst appointed for the Parish of St. Mary Islington, upon the Articles Analysed by him under the above Act during the Quarter eliding the 31 st December, 1890. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, During the last quarter your Inspectors submitted to me for analysis 96 samples of food and drugs, of which 8 were adulterated. The adulterated samples were: Milk, Butter, Cocoa, Mustard and Carbolic Acid. In the case of the Carbolic Acid the Analysis was disputed, and the sample was referred to the Somerset House Authorities who confirmed the adulteration. The summons was, however, dismissed by the Magistrate on the ground that Commercial Carbolic Acid was not a drug within the meaning of the Food and Drugs Act. Although differing entirely in opinion with the Magistrate as to what defines a drug, I would point out that as his decision has not been appealed against it is binding till such time as it shall be upset on appeal. I would therefore urge that in future no drugs be taken under this Act, except those in the British Pharmacopoeia, although many valuable drugs, e.g., Quinine, are not placed in that official list. Your obedient Servant, FRANK L. TEED, D.Sc. Lond., F.C.S., F.I.C., Public Analyst. "The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875."—IV. No. Article submitted for Analysis.

ESTIMATE OF THE SEVERAL SUMS OF MONEY NECESSARY TO BE RAISED FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDING MICHAELMAS,1890 AS SETTLED BY THE SEVERAL COMMITTEES, FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE VESTRY, On the 7th of February, 1890. By order, WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. NOTE.—The rateable value of the Parish is £1,653,378 and a pennyrate, after allowing for empties and other losses, is estimated to produce £6,500. VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Estimates for Rates. POOR RATE. The amount required to be raised for the half-year ending 30th September, 1890, is £117,505, which is equal to a Rate of 1s. 6d. in the £. The Poor Rate for the corresponding period last year, together with the Consolidated Rate (which is now included in the Poor Rate), was also 1s. 6d. As compared with the current Rate, made on the 2nd August last, there is an increase of £30,676, equivalent to a Rate of about 4½d. in the pound. The principal items of increase are shewn in the following statement:— Half-year ending Lady-Day, 1890. Half-year ending Michaelmas, 1890. Increase. £ £ £ Board of Guardians' Contribution Order 33,667 47,112 13,445 Requirements of the London County Council 35,730 49,940 14,210 Preparation of the Quinquennial Valuation List Nil. 800 800 Estimated requirements of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Washhouses Nil. 2,000 2,000 The increase in the Guardians' Contribution Order is owing partly to the fact that a twelve months' grant for indoor poor, amounting to £12,715 was estimated by the Guardians to be received in the Contribution Order for the current half-year ; whereas in the present Contribution Order credit is taken for only six months' grant, a loss therefore of £6,358. There is also an increase in the requirements of the Metropolitan Asylums Board of £1,815, and in the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund of £2,844. There are also several other items where the estimate is increased, amounting altogether to about £2,400. With regard to the requirements of the London County Council, the estimate is based upon the precept of the Council for the corresponding period of last year, the Comptroller being at present unable to furnish any definite particulars. Last year the Council's precept for the first six months was £14,210 more than that for the last six months. 3 LIGHTING BATE. A rate of 1d. in the £ is required to provide for the expenses of Public lighting. This is the same as in the two previous half-years. GENERAL RATE. The amount necessary to be raised for the General Rate is £75,962, equal to a rate of ll¾d. in the £. As compared with the current Rate, this will result in a decrease of ¾d., but in an increase on that for the corresponding period of last year (when the Rate levied was 9d.) of 2¾-d. in the £. The latter Rate was, however, insufficient, as it left a deficit of'£8,207 to be carried forward. On comparing the present estimates with those of the corresponding period for last year, it will be seen that, whereas at that time there was a balance in hand from the previous rate of £1,990, it is estimated that there will probably be on the current Rate a deficiency of £895, a loss, therefore, altogether of £2,885. Besides this the Highways Committee require £2,012 more than for the same period last year, while the London School Board, whose requirements exceeded the amount provided in last year's estimate by £3,107, have now further increased their precept by £5,076. SEWERS RATE. The amount required for the Sewers Rate is £1,621, or a ¼d. Rate. The Rate levied for the same period last year was ½d. in the £. ARTHUR TOWERS, Accountant to the Vestry. 4 5 ???

AS SETTLED BY THE SEVERAL COMMITTEES, FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE VESTRY, On the 1st of August, 1890. By order, WM. F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. NOTE.— The rateable value of the Parish is £1,662,379, and a pennyrate, after allowing for empties and other losses, is estimated to produce £6,540 VESTRY OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON. Estimates for Rates. POOR RATE. The amount necessary to be raised ferthe half-year ending Lady-Day, 1891, is £107,383, to meet which a Rate of Is. 4¼d. in the £ will he required. This is a rodnotion of l¼d. upon the current Rate, made on tho 7th February last, but compared with the corresponding period of last year, is an increase of 2¾d. in the £. The principal items of increase are shewn below:— Half-year ending Lady-Day, 1800 Half-year ending Lady-Day, 1801. Increase. £ £ £ Hoard of Guardians 33,667 41,913 8,246 London County Council 36,730 45,587 9,857 69,397 87,500 18,103 The increase in the estimated requirements of the London County Council is due to the fact that the Council has now equalized tho amounts of its half-yearly precepts. Last year 17/2 ths of the whole sum required by the County Council was collected in the First hall-year, and 5/12ths. only, in tho socond. LIGHTING RATE. The amount which will probably he required to provide for the oxpenses of Public Lighting for the half-year ending Lady-day next is £7,270. A Penny Rale in estimated to produce £(5,640; it will, therefore, bo necessary to levy a Rate of l¼d. in the £. This is an increase of ¼d. upon tho Rates raised in the last two half-years. GENERAL RATE. The amount necessary to be raised for the General Rate is £78,020, which is equal to a Rate of Is. in the £. Of this, £39,2(58, or very nearly one-half the whole sum, is required to meet the Precepts of the School Board for ,,,The Rate now proposed is an increase of ¼d. in the £ on the current Rate compared with that of the corresponding period of last year is a Deerease of ½d. in the £ 3 SEWERS RATE. The amount required to defray the expenses connected with the sewerage of the Parish is £2,786. To meet this a Kate of Ad. in the £ will be necessary. This is the same as for the corresponding period of last year, but is an increase of £d. upon the current Rate. The following Statement gives the proportions of the Rate under the several heads of Expenditure, and also shews the amount required for Vestry purposes, and that for expenditure over which the Vestry has no control. From this it will be seen that, although the total Rate required for the six months ending Lady-day next is an increase of 2½d. in the £ opon that raised for the corresponding period of last year, the amount required for strictly Vestry purposes is less by Id. in the £, the Rates necessary to meet expenditure over which the Vestry exercises 110 control having increased by 3½d. in the £. It will also be observed that out of a Rate of 2s. fid. in tho £, not more than 8d. in the £ is actually disbursed by the Vestry. The figures for the two previous half-years are given for purposes of comparison. Half-year ending Lady-Day, 1891. Half-year ending Michaelmas, 1890. Half-year ending Lady-Day, 1890. d. d. d.

The Board of Assessors beg to report that pursuant to your resolution of 17th January, 1890, they have completed the Quinquennial Valuation of all the rateable hereditaments in the Parish of Islington for the year 1890, making the sixth valuation thus completed since the passing of the Valuation of Property (Metropolis) Act in 1869. The List is contained in twelve Books corresponding to the Districts of the twelve Rate Collectors of the Parish, there being one more collector and book than there were five years ago. The List as deposited then contained 40,692 rateable hereditaments of a total value of £1,954,409 gross, and £1,619,877 rateable—whereas the present List contains 43,016 rateable hereditaments of a total value of £2,038,614 gross and £1,693,199 rateable, the increase during the five years having been, roughly speaking, about 3,000 in number, but only £84,000 and £73,000 in gross and rateable value respectively. The small increase in value as compared with that in the number of the rateable hereditaments of the parish is due to the general decline in value of good and middle class house property during the past five years. If, however, the new Valuation be compared with that in existence at the present time (see Table A attached hereto), it will be seen that, apart from the Assessments of the Public Companies, there is but a slight increase in the value of the Parish as a whole, and this slight increase is more than absorbed by the increased assessments of a special class of property.* Thus the value of property over the greater part of the Parish again shews a considerable decrease. The increase in the gross value shown by the new valuation upon the valuation at present in force is £37,387 of which £31,504 is due to the increase in the gross value of the Public Companies. * See Table B 2 To compare the preparation of the present list with that of five years ago, it should be borne in mind that 43,016 rateable hereditaments have been dealt with instead of 40,692, and that out of the number of forms of return served on these hereditaments 35,534 were received back as against 31,898 in 1885. On the other hand, the number of assessments increased in value was 5,671 as against 8,043 at the last Quinquennial Valuation, so that in that respect the labor has been slightly reduced. In order that the members of the Vestry should be able to form an idea of the clerical work involved in the preparation of the list, it is necessary to go into details, and the following facts are therefore submitted:— In February last a skeleton Valuation List containing 42,955 entries was prepared from the Rate books then in force, and during the same month an equivalent number of forms (supplied by the Inland Revenue Department, pursuant to the Valuation (Metropolis) Act of 1869) were addressed, numbered, and served, each form being numbered for and served upon a separate rateable hereditament in the Parish. Of these forms 35,534 were as before stated, received back in the shape of Returns, the contents of which were, as they came in, abstracted in the skeleton list before referred to. When this preliminary work, which was carried out by the Collectors was completed, the Board of Assessors sat from day to day to compare the Returns received with the present gross values, and, with the assistance of the Collectors, and the extraneous information possessed by themselves, or where necessary, obtained by viewing the property, determined the gross values to be inserted in the new Lists. The Board were thus occupied during a considerable portion of the fifteen days they sat for the purpose. The class was then determined in accordance with the third schedule to the Valuation of Property (Metropolis) Act, 1869, and the rate of deduction per cent., together with the rateable value of each hereditament, calculated and entered in the draft List, the hereditaments which had been increased in value being at the same time ticked, in order that the notices required by the before-mentioned Act might be duly prepared and served upon the property.0 3 The copying the twelve books (of which the list is composed), in duplicate, then commenced, and after its completion the examination of the whole with the draft, the returns, and the current Kate books, occupied your Vestry Clerk, Chief Clerk, and Accountant, with the Collectors and two Assistant Clerks, a period of no less than eleven evenings, the necessity for completing the work in time for the deposit of the List on the 31st of May, often compelling them to sit until nearly midnight. After the examination was completed, the list was sealed pursuant to your order and deposited on the 31st of May as required by the Valuation Act, and ten days after that date the necessary notices of increase or new assessments, amounting to 5,671 were filled in, numbered, and served, the service being performed by your Rate Collectors. The whole of the clerical work has been performed by your office staff and collectors working overtime, under the superintendence of the Vestry Clerk, in accordance with your resolution of 17th January, 1890. In addition to personally organizing and superintending with the assistance of the Chief Clerk, the whole of this responsible work, your Vestry Clerk has with the assistance of the Accountant again analyzed the current accounts of the public companies having works in the Parish, and bringing to bear his knowledge of the laws of rating such works, has submitted calculations upon the basis of which the Board of Assessors has seen their way to materially increase the assessments of most of such companies. In fact, as before stated, but for these companies, the Public Houses* and a few special properties, the valuation of the Parish would show a considerable reduction. (1). The total expense of the clerical work connected with this Valuation is £663 6s. ll½d., the details of which are shown in Table C attached to this Report. This amount is less in proportion to the work done than was paid five years since, and the Board have considerable pleasure in recommending that the several accounts, which they have examined, be paid. (2.) The Board further recommends that, as usual, a gratuity of one hundred guineas be paid to your Vestry Clerk for the extra trouble * See Table B. 4 and time he has devoted to the work, and particularly for the special services he has rendered in connection with the Assessment of the Public Companies. (3. ) In expressing the hope that the Valuation will be found, on the whole, satisfactory, the Board would remind the Vestry that in addition to the services of the staff the Board itself has sat for the purpose of this Valuation fifteen times, frequently until a late hour in the evening ; and (apart from the personal interests of the present Members, which may be very short), the Board feels it to be its duty, in the interests of the parish—having regard to the fact that an allovaance to the Board of Assessors has the sanction of the Local Act of the parish, as well as of long custom—to recommend that the Resolution of the Vestry of 27th June, 1889, be revoked or altered so far as it affects an allowance to the Board of Assessors, and that a sum of £150 for their expenses during the current year be granted them as heretofore. All which is submitted. Signed, on behalf of the Board, JNO. S. FURLONG, Chairman. 5 TABLE A. PARISH OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. QUINQUENNIAL VALUATION LIST, 1890. Book. District. Collector.

Report of the Assessment Committee of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington. The Assessment Committee of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington, appointed on the 18th day of April, 1890, pursuant to the "Valuation of Property (Metropolis) Act, 1869," submits its Quinquennial report as follows:— The fifth Quinquennial Valuation List for the Parish was deposited by the Overseers on the 30th May, 1890, and contained 43,016 rateable hereditaments of a gross value of £2,038,614, and of a rateable value of £1,693,199. The last day for lodging objections to the List was the 26th June, 1890, and on the 30th June the Committee was informed by the Clerk that up to that date he had received the following notices of objection:— Ordinary Ratepayers 2,633 Surveyors of Taxes 650 Owners or Occupiers of Public-houses in the Parish 83 Public Companies 7 It will be seen, however, by the Schedule attached, that a considerable number of notices of objection were received subsequently, and dealt with by the Committee as though they had been in time. There were also a number of objections to the alterations made by the Committee which of course could only be dealt with after the re-deposit of the List. Arrangements were made for the hearing of the objections according to the collecting Districts of the Parish, and notices of the day and hour on which the Committee would sit to hear and determine objections, were served by hand at the houses of Ratepayers who had given notice, in addition to the statutory notices of the Committee's sittings which were published by posting on the doors of the Churches and Chapels in the Parish. On the 14th July, 1890, the Committee commenced its sittings, and from that date to the 29th October, 1890, when the List was finally approved, it held 28 meetings, commencing at 10 a.m. and continuing many of them, until a late hour in the evening. The number of objections heard amounted to 2,884, the number of properties viewed to 286, the number of assessments reduced to 1,692, and the number increased on objections lodged by the Surveyors of Taxes to 527. With regard to the latter class of cases, the Committee would repeat that it has no option under the Valuation Act, but to increase such assessments as may be objected to Surveyors' Objections 2 by the Surveyors of Taxes to the amounts required by them, unless direct evidence is produced to the effect that such amounts are too high. public Houses. One feature of the recent Quinquennial Valuation was the large amount by which the Overseers deemed it necessary to increase the assessments of the public houses in the Parish. Of these, 156 were increased by £11,534. Eighty-three notices of objection were received, five of which were afterwards withdrawn, but in 51 cases the parties interested were represented by their counsel, solicitors and trade valuers, before the Committee. After fully considering the evidence submitted, the Committee made reductions in only 12 cases, while in 8 others they still further increased the valuations of the Overseers, the result being a reduction of only £100 in the gross value originally fixed by them. The total increase in the Quinquennial Valuation List in respect of public house property alone is therefore £11,434; and in connection with this fact it is worthy of note that no appeal in respect of such property has been lodged with either the special or quarter sessions. Public Companies Another class of objections which calls for special notice is that of the public companies, the increase in the value of which, together with the addition in respect of the public houses, more than accounts for the increase in the total valuation of the Parish by the Quinquennial Valuation List. The fact that these two classes of property have been increased by £42,768, while the total increase shown by the List is but £36,080 is evidence that but for such properties the valuation of the Parish would have shown a decrease, notwithstanding new property, of nearly £7,000. There are twelve Public Companies included in the List, the total rateable value of which exceeds that of the assessments in any one of the collecting districts of the Parish. The assessments of these Companies had been increased in the Quinquennial Valuation List from £173,570 to £204,804. Seven companies gave notice of objection to the List, and on the days set apart for the purpose appeared by their Counsel or Solicitor, and by professional witnesses in support of their objections. The Committee did not deem it necessary to put the Parish to the very large expense which would have been caused by having the undertakings owned by these Companies, or the portions of them in Islington, independently valued by professional Surveyors, but did its best, from the calculations which had been prepared for the occasion by the Clerk with the assistance of the Vestry's 3 Accountant, and from the facts and figures supplied by the Companies, to determine the gross and rateable values of such undertakings for themselves. The result of the alterations made in the Valuation List by the Committee on the hearing of objections was that when the List was finally approved by the Committee on the 29th October, 1890, the total gross value originally shewn therein had been reduced from £2,038,614 to £2,025,631, and the total rateable value from £1,693,199 to £1,686,385. Result of Objections. Against the List as finally approved by the Committee there were lodged but two notices of appeal to Special Sessions. They were in respect of ordinary house property. One alone was persevered with, upon which a slight reduction was obtained. Appeals to Special Sessions. Ten notices of appeal to the Court of Quarter Sessions (as it is now called) were received, four being from Public Companies as before mentioned, three from leading shopkeepers, one from the Holloway Branch of the London and South-Western Bank, and two from ordinary householders. Appeals to Quarter Sessions. The particulars of these appeals are as follows:— The Gras Light and Coke Company, in respect of the Company's mains and pipes throughout the parish. The figures entered in the list by the Overseers, viz.:—£60,000 gross and £54,490 rateable value, showed an increase of £7,611 in the gross and £9,490 in the rateable value upon the existing assessment, and were based upon the Company's accounts for the year 1889. On the 11th September, Mr. William Castle and Mr. Vigers attended before the Committee and submitted fuller details on behalf of the Company more particularly as regards the great increase which had then commenced to take place in the cost of coal and in wages, but as they claimed a reduction to £19,364 gross and £17,396 rateable, and there appeared no possibility of arriving at a satisfactory compromise it was decided to confirm the figures of the Overseers. The Company subsequently gave notice of appeal to the Court of Assessment Sessions, and in due course supplied copies of their Case, from which it appeared the reduction claimed was from £60,000 to £19,364 in the gross, and from £54,490 to £17,396 in the rateable value, a reduction, it may be remarked, equivalentto about £9,000 per annum. The Committee learning that other parishes had also received notice of the Company's intention to appeal, convened a conference of the representatives of such parishes with a view to taking united action. This took place, and representatives from Kensington, Hackney, Marylebone, Chelsea, and Bethnal Green being present, it was agreed Gas Light and Coke Company. 4 that the Assessment Committees of these parishes should unite in fighting the several appeals so far as possible, that the SolicitorGeneral and Mr. Poland should be briefed as leading counsel, and that special Valuers, Gas Engineers, and a firm of Chartered Accountants should be retained to prepare a valuation of the ent ire undertaking. This appeal, although it has been several times mentioned in Court, has not yet been heard, and, considering the large mass of evidence which has been accumulated and the interests at stake, it seems doubtful when it will be, but when it was remembered that the previous Quinquennial assessments had been agreed to by the Company after objections before the Committee, and that a considerable number of new houses had been erected since the last assessment was settled, the Committee felt it had no option but to contest this appeal to the utmost and at almost any cost. In taking this course the Committee is pleased to think it had the full concurrence and support of the Vestry. The Regent's Canal. The Regent's Canal is rateable under the Company's private Act of Parliament only as "lands of a like quality," * * * "in the respective Parishes where the same shall be situate are or shall be assessed or charged." It may be remembered that five years ago a compromise was effected in Court with this Company, by which the rating was agreed at the rate of £40 per acre on certain measurements settled by the respective Surveyors. This area, however, did not include about 1¾ acres, known as the Horsfall Basin, which, the Company stated at the time, was not in their occupation, but which, upon subsequent evidence, the Overseers assessed in a supplemental valuation list, the question of occupation being decided against the Company in proceedings upon an action of replevin, first in the Clerkenwell County Court, and subsequently by way of appeal in the High Court. The Overseers in the new Quinquennia] List had not only treated Horsfall Basin as occupied by the Company, but had increased the assessment of the whole to £840 gross and £800 rateable, on which figures the Committee did not see its way to make any reduction. The Company also objected to the assessment of a wharf, stabling, cottages and land in Graham Street, which had been inserted in the List at £270 gross, and £225 rateable value. The Cases submitted by the Appellants showed that they still contended that the Horsfall Basin was not in their occupation, and that it should not be included in the assessment. They further objected to the value put upon the land, and desired that the assessment of the wharf should be reduced to £200 gross, and £166 rateable. 5 The Court decided in favor of the Committee as regards the Company's occupation of Horsfall Basin, but reduced the total assessment to £480 gross, and £460 rateable value. The assessment of the wharf, stabling, cottages, &c., in Graham Street, was also reduced to £220 gross, and £184 rateable. The Agricultural Hall was assessed in the Quinquennial Valuation List as deposited by the Overseers, at £6,000 gross and £5,000 rateable value. It will be remembered that the Appellants in 1888 appealed to the Court of Assessment Sessions against the Supplemental Valuation List for this Parish, on the ground that an alteration within the meaning of the Valuation Act had taken place in the value of the Agricultural Hall and Offices, and that such alteration had not been shown in the List. The contention then was that the receipts for the year had been less than in previous years, and that this within the meaning of the Act constituted an alteration in value. The legal point was subsequently decided in favor of the Company in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court, whereupon the Committee, after taking into consideration the accounts of the Company for the year 1887 (an admittedly bad year for the Company), reduced the Company's assessment to £5,600 gross and £4,500 rateable, at which figures the Hall stood, with the exception of a small structural addition, until the new Quinquennial List was deposited. The Committee, after comparing the Company's receipts and expenditure for the year 1889 (also a bad year) with those for 1887, reduced the assessment practically to what it had been before the deposit of the List, viz.:—£5,675 gross and £4,563 rateable. The Company have given notice of appeal and submitted their Case, but the appeal has not vet been heard. Agricultural Hall. The appeal of the Midland Railway Company in respect of the assessment of the Tottenham and Hampstead Railway is also undecided. The total length of this railway, which unites the Great Eastern and Midland system, is 4½ miles, of which one mile 670 yards, together with four stations, is in Islington. It will be remembered that in 1886 the Committee reported that by an agreement entered into May 25th, 1870, and then in existence, between the Midland Railway Company the Great Eastern Railway Company, and the Tottenham and Hampstead Railway Company, the two former Companies agreed to work and maintain this line, and to pay the latter Company 54 per cent. of the gross receipts, which were admitted to amount to £11,664 in respect of the Islington portion of the Railway, and that, although the Committee sought to obtain a case upon its right to assess the Company upon such a rental, the Court of Assessment Sessions not only Tottenham and Hampstead Railway. 6 declined to entertain the point itself, but refused to let it be decided by a superior Court. The line and stations in Islington Parish which had been previously assessed at £3,100 gross, and £1,504 rateable value, were increased by the Overseers at this valuation to £5,400 gross, and £'4,500 rateable value; which values the Committee has affirmed with the view of again raising the question of the Overseers right to assess the hereditament upon the rent actually paid. 147, Highbury New Park. In the case of Mr. Allt, of 147, Highbury New Park, the Overseers had inserted the house in the List at £100 gross value. The Surveyor of Taxes increased it to £110, and subsequently upon evidence produced to the Committee, it was further increased to £120. Mr. Allt's contention before the Court was that other similar houses in the vicinity were letting at reduced rents, and that when the long lease under which he held the property expired the house would be let at a much lower figure. The Court reduced the assessment to £105 gross and £88 rateable value. Appeals settled out of Court. As regards the other cases, viz., the premises of Jones Bros., Crisp & Co., Flatau Bros., London & South Western Bank, and Trays Hill, Hornsey Lane, the Committee entered into correspondence with the Appellants with the result that compromises were agreed to in each instance, and the several appeals settled out of Court. Total gross and rateable value. The total gross and rateable values of the several collecting districts, subject to the result of the cases to be decided, are shown on the schedule marked "A," while, for the sake of comparison with former years, a second schedule (B) is attached, showing the number of assessments and the gross and rateable value for the past five quinquennial periods. Costs and Expenses. Owing to the fact that the appeals of the Gas Light and Coke Company, Midland Railway Company, and the Agricultural Hall Company, are still undecided, the Committee is unable to do more than state that the costs and expenses incurred up to the present time amount to £688 16s. 8d., and as the Vestry has already raised £1,000 upon the Poor Rate to meet these expenses, the Committee thinks it desirable that this amount should be paid over to it as provided by the Valuation Act. Action of London County Council. The Committee does not feel that it can conclude this report without calling attention to the large measure of success which has attended its action, and that of the Vestry, in urging upon the County Council to exercise its powers under and pursuant to Section 32 of the Valuation Act, by enforcing upon the various Parishes of the Metropolis 7 their duty in fairly assessing the rateable hereditaments within their own boundaries. It will be remembered that the County Council convened a conference of the various Assessment Committees of the Metropolis upon the subject, and that the Committee's Clerk (Mr. Dewey) then put forward such strong reasons for interference on the part of the Council, that the latter resolved to take action. This action resulted in appeals being lodged by the County Council against the totals of various parishes, which were alleged to be under assessed, to the extent of £400,000, a matter of no little moment to Islington in these days of high rating. The result of these appeals upon the part of the Council is not yet fully known—some have been decided in its favor, but still more have been compromised, while a few important ones yet remain to be decided. Under any circumstances, a considerable addition will have been made to the total rateable value of the metropolis elsewhere than in Islington, which must result in lightening metropolitan burdens so far as that parish is concerned, but what is of more importance is the effect which this action upon the part of the County Council will have in the future upon the Valuation Lists of the Metropolis. A Supplemental Report will be presented when the outstanding appeals are decided, stating the results, and submitting an account of the total costs incurred by the Committee. (Signed) WM.

MARY. ISLINGTON, IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COUNTY OF LONDON. REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED ON JULY 5th, 1889, FOR THE REVISION OF THE BY-LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF THE VESTRY, Ordered by the Committee to be printed and circulated, and to b submitted to the Vestry for consideration at a Special Meeting, to be convened for FRIDAY, May 30, 1890. WILLIAM F. DEWEY, Vestry Clerk. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. The Special Committee appointed by the Vestry on July 5th, 1889, for the revision of the By-Laws and Regulations of the Vestry, begs to report as follows:— A copy of the Resolutions of the Vestry, setting forth the objects with which the Committee was originally appointed and its constitution, together with copies of resolutions from time to time passed by the Vestry, referring various matters to the Committee for consideration, are herewith submitted (Appendix A). The Committee has met twenty-three times. At its first meeting, on July 12th, 1889, it appointed Mr. Samuel Price as its Chairman, and arranged its course of procedure. At its second meeting, held on October 11th, it became necessary, in consequence of the much to be regretted retirement of Mr. Price from the Vestry, to appoint a fresh Chairman, and Mr. John Hurden Mote was unanimously selected for the position. The subject which first occupied the attention of the Committee was that portion of the Vestry's original reference directing it to enquire as to the practice of other bodies in complying with Sec. 58 of 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, requiring the acts of committees to be submitted for approval, and to report thereon. The Committee caused enquiries to be made accordingly of the London County Council and the other vestries and district boards of the metropolis, and as the result of such enquiries it has framed a By-Law (No. 7 in Appendix B) dealing with the question. 4 As regards the other matters referred from time to time by the Vestry for the consideration of the Committee it may be of advantage to briefly summarize the results as follows:— (a) The Committee has after consideration not deemed it desirable to recommend the Vestry to change its night of meeting (Vestry reference, July 19th, 1889). (b) Neither has the Committee considered it advisable to recommend any radical change in the duties of the Accounts Committee, although it is of opinion that the name of the Committee should be changed to that of "Finance Committee" (Vestry reference August 2nd, 1889). (c) As regards the letter from the Vestry of Chelsea, dated December 7th, 1889, suggesting the desirability of legislation in favour of substituting a printed copy of minutes of vestries and district boards for the written copy required by Sec. 60 of 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, the Committee is of opinion that where a vestry or district board does print its minutes the production of an authenticated printed copy should be held to be a compliance with the section; that the members for the borough should be asked to support any Bill brought in to further this object; and that the Vestry of Chelsea be so informed. (d) The Vestry's reference of January 3rd, 1890, as regards imposing a limit to the length of speeches is dealt with by a By-Law 28 Appendix B). (e) The Vestry's reference of January 17th, 1890, as regards the power of a Chairman of Committee to give a casting vote is dealt with by a By-Law (30 Appendix B). (f) The Committee has not thought it necessary to recommend any departure from the present practice in regard to the Vestrymen's Signature Book (Vestry reference, January 24th, 1890). 5 (g) In reply to the Vestry reference of February 14th, 1890, with regard to the control of the Vestry's Books and other documents, and their inspection by Ratepayers, the Committee has not deemed it desirable to recommend any departure from the present practice, but the practice itself is more elaborately set forth in the new By-Law (45 Appendix B). The most notable departure from the present practice of the Vestry which the Committee has thought fit to recommend is the appointment of a "Works" Committee, combining in itself the duties at present performed by the Highways, Sewers and Buildings, Lighting and Dusting and Slopping Committees. In taking this step the Committee has been guided not only by the practice of the majority of the other Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, but bv what it believes to be the / «/ predominant feeling of the Vestry, viz., that the appointment of such a Committee will tend to economy, efficiency and dispatch of business. Other points to which the Committee directs particular attention as being departures from the present practice of the Vestry and dealt with in Appendix B are— (a) The printing of the Minutes of the Vestry (By-Law 13) (b) The regulation of Questions (By-Law 16). (c) Provisions for the closure (By-Laws 18 & 23). (d) Provision for the appointment of Special mittees and other bodies (By-Law 31). (e) A By-Law (No. 32) to provide against the struction of business. (/) A By-Law (No. 48) to ensure open tenders. With these exceptions it is not necessary to deal in detail with the By-Laws as revised by your Committee and now submitted. 6 They will be found together with a schedule containing the duties of the several Committees fully set out in Appendix B. In conclusion your Committee recommends:— 1. That the several Resolutions whether By-Laws of the Vestry or Resolutions not being By-Laws as set forth in the Rota Book and passed at Meetings of the Vestry held on January 13th, 1865, February 24th, 1865, and March 10th, 1865, and confirmed at a Meeting of the Vestry held on May 19th, 1865, be revoked. 2. That the several resolutions, not being By-Laws of the Vestry, as set forth in the Rota Book, and passed respectively at meetings of the Vestry held on August 2nd, 1872; October 3rd, 1873; May 7th, 1875; January 7th, 1876; October 20tli, 1876; May 11th, 1877; December 7th, 1877; January 3rd, 1879; October 7th, 1881; March 3rd, 18*2; February 19th, 1886; April 2nd, 1886; and July 2nd, 1886, be revoked. (3) That the By-Laws set forth in Appendix " B " to this Report, together with the Schedule thereto setting forth the duties of the several Committees to be appointed by the Vestry, be adopted in substitution of such revoked ByLaws and Resolutions as By Laws for tlie government of the Vestry, pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions contained in Sec. 202 of The Metropolis Management Act, 1856, 18 & 19 Vic. cap. 120. All which is submitted. Signed on behalf of the Committee, Dated May 5th, 1890. JNO. II. MOTE, Chairman. 7 APPENDIX A. Extracts from Minutes of the Vestry. Extract from Minutes of 5th July, 1889.

REPOET OF SANITARY COMMITTEE, submitting A SUMMARY OF The Provisions contained in the "Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890." (Vestry Reference, 17th October, 1890.) Printed by Order of the Sanitary Committee. WILLIAM F. DEWEY, Vestry CUrk. LONDON: Chjls. Strakkr & Sons, Printers, Bishopsgate Avenue, Camomile Street, London, E.C. 1890. TO THE VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Your Sanitary Committee begs to report as follows:— That it has had under consideration, pursuant to the Vestry reference of the 17th October, 1890, the "Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890," a copy of which is sent herewith. A summary of the provisions of the Act (which will come into force on the 4th December, in London), has been issued by the Local Government Board. It is therein stated that the Act confers upon the Local Authorities and their officers important powers and duties as regards:— (а) The inspection of dairies, and the prohibition of the supply of milk therefrom in cases where it appears that infectious disease can be attributable to, or is likely to be caused by, the consumption of milk so supplied; (б) The cleansing and disinfection of premises, bedding, clothing, &c., for the purpose of preventing or checking infectious diseases; (c) The retention, removal, and burial of the bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease ; (d) The detention in hospital of persons suffering from infectious diseases, who would, on leaving the hospital, be without proper lodging ; and (e) The provision of temporary shelter and attendance for members of families who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of the dwellings being disinfected by the local authority. 4 Section 4 enables a Medical Officer of Health, under specified conditions, to inspect a dairy within or without the district of his local authority, if he has evidence that infectious disease in the district is attributable to milk from the dairy. Upon his report that infectious disease is caused by consumption of the r . ilk supplied from the dairy, the local authority may require the dairyman to appear before them, after not less than twenty-four hours' notice, to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him not to supply any milk from the dairy within his district, until such order has been withdrawn by the local authority. The order may be withdrawn forthwith by the authority, or by the Medical Officer on their behalf, should he be satisfied that the milk supply has been changed, or that the cause of the infection has been removed. (The clause is likely to prove practically inoperative on account of the delay that would be unavoidable.) Section 5 repeals Section 22 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and substitutes provisions in regard to disinfection to the effect that where the Medical Officer of Health, or any other registered medical practitioner, certifies as to the necessity for cleansing and disinfection after infectious disease, the Clerk to the Local Authority is to give notice to the owner or occupier that the house or part of the house, as well as infected articles therein, will be disinfected at the cost of the owner or occupier unless such owner or occupier within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice informs the authority that he will himself do the cleansing and disinfection to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health within a time fixed in the notice. If within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice the person to whom it is given does not inform the authority that he will so do the cleansing, &c., or if, having so informed the authority, he fails to have the work done within the time fixed in the notice, the work shall be done by the officers of the local authority under the superintendence of the Medical officer of Health. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the owner or occupier in a summary manner. Where the owner or occupier is unable effectually to cleanse and disinfect, the officers of the local authority, with the consent of the owner or occupier, may do the work at the cost ot the authority, without the notice already referred to being given. 5 (The advantage gained by this section is that the clerk to the local authority will have express statutory direction for his action in giving notice, and will not need specific authority. Delay will be prevented, since the officers will be able to proceed to cleanse and disinfect, if, twenty-four hours aft er the owner or occupier has received the notice, he has not informed the authority that he will do the work to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. But the Vestry must consider that as yet they have not provided a disinfecting chamber as a part of their sanitary machinery.) Section 17. For the purpose of carrying Section 5 into effect the local authority may, by any officer appointed in that behalf, who shall produce his authority in writing, enter any premises between the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Section 15 provides that, if it be necessary for the members of a family to leave their dwelling, so that it may be efficiently disinfected by the local authority, the local authority must provide them, free of charge, with a temporary shelter or house accommodation, and any necessary attendants. (This is a provision which would seem to require the early attention of the Vestry.) Section 6 provides that the Medical Officer of Health may, by notice in writing, require the owner of any infected bedding, clothing, &c., to cause the same to be delivered to and removed by an officer of the local authority, for purposes of disinfection. The articles, after disinfection, are to be taken back and delivered to the owner, free of charge. (Penalty for failure to comply with the above requirement not to exceed £10.) Section 7 deals with the reletting of a house or part, after infectious disease has been in the house. It is intended for the protection of persons entering upon occupation. But the protection is limited, as the penalty (not exceeding £10) for failure to disinfect, and for omission to give notice to the owner, is not incurred should the outgoing tenant vacate the house six weeks after it has been occupied by a person suffering from an infectious disease. Presumably, however, the case would be dealt with by the local authority in connection with the Notification Act, and it is the duty of 6 the said authority, if they are aware that there is a person suffering from an infectious disease in any house to give notice of the provisions of the section (7) to the occupier. Section 11, makes a person guilty of an offence, under the Act, who hires or uses a public conveyance (other than a hearse), for the conveyance of an infected body, without notifying the fact to the owner or driver. Further, the owner or driver will be guilty of an offence under the Act if, after receiving such notification, he does not provide for the disinfection of the vehicle. Sections 8 to 10 deal with the retention, removal, and burial of dead bodies. After death from an infectious disease, a body may not be retained elsewhere than in a public mortuary, or in a room not used at the time as a dwelling place, sleeping place, or workroom, for more than 48 hours, without the sanction, in writing, of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a registered medical practitioner (Section 8). Section 9 is intended to provide for the burial, direct from the hospital, &c., of any person who may die therein of an infectious disease. The body, however, may be removed to a mortuary. The penalty for an offence under this section, which is made operative by the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a registered medical practitioner, is not to exceed £10. Should the infected body remain unburied, elsewhere than in a mortuary or in a room as above-mentioned (8), for more than 48 hours, without medical sanction, or should any Dead body be retained in a house so as to endanger the health of the inmates, any justice may, on the application of the Medical Officer of Health, order the body to be removed, at the cost of the local authority, to any available mortuary, and direct the same to be buried within a time limited in the order. A justice, moreover, may direct the immediate burial of an infected body, or of any dead body the immediate burial of which he may consider necessary. Should the friends or relatives of the deceased in any of the above cases not undertake to bury the body within the time limited by the order of the justice, it will be the duty of the Believing Officer to bury such body, and the Guardians may recover the expenses incurred, in a 7 summary manner, from any person legally liable to pay the expenses of the burial (Section 10). Section 12 provides for the detention in a hospital by the order of a justice and at the cost of the local authority, of an infectious person who is in the hospital, and would not, on leaving the hospital, be provided with lodging or accommodation in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent his spreading the disorder. Section 16 deals with penalties. For offending against an enactment where no penalty is specifically imposed. For example, the offence of wilfully obstructing the duly authorised officers of the local authority or of obstructing the carrying out of any order of a justice, the penalty is not to exceed £5 ; and if the offence is a continuing one a daily penalty not exceeding 40s. a day, so long as the offence is continued, is incurred. Penalties will be recoverable in a court of summary jurisdiction on the information or complaint of the local authority or of their duly authorised officers, but not otherwise. The amounts are to be paid to the local authority (Section 18.) All which is submitted. GEORGE LANCASTER, Chairman, Sanitary Committee. Vestry Offices, Upper Street, N. 10th November, 1890.

It is therein stated that the Act confers upon the Local Authorities and their officers important powers and duties as regards:— (а) The inspection of dairies, and the prohibition of the supply of milk therefrom in cases where it appears that infectious disease can be attributable to, or is likely to be caused by, the consumption of milk so supplied; (б) The cleansing and disinfection of premises, bedding, clothing, &c., for the purpose of preventing or checking infectious diseases; (c) The retention, removal, and burial of the bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease ; (d) The detention in hospital of persons suffering from infectious diseases, who would, on leaving the hospital, be without proper lodging ; and (e) The provision of temporary shelter and attendance for members of families who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purpose of the dwellings being disinfected by the local authority. 4 Section 4 enables a Medical Officer of Health, under specified conditions, to inspect a dairy within or without the district of his local authority, if he has evidence that infectious disease in the district is attributable to milk from the dairy. Upon his report that infectious disease is caused by consumption of the rsilk supplied from the dairy, the local authority may require the dairyman to appear before them, after not less than twenty-four hours' notice, to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him not to supply any milk from the dairy within his district, until such order has been withdrawn by the local authority. The order may be withdrawn forthwith by the authority, or by the Medical Officer on their behalf, should he be satisfied that the milk supply has been changed, or that the cause of the infection has been removed. (The clause is likely to prove practically inoperative on account of the delay that would be unavoidable.) Section 5 repeals Section 22 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and substitutes provisions in regard to disinfection to the effect that where the Medical Officer of Health, or any other registered medical practitioner, certifies as to the necessity for cleansing and disinfection after infectious disease, the Clerk to the Local Authority is to give notice to the owner or occupier that the house or part of the house, as well as infected articles therein, will be disinfected at the cost of the owner or occupier unless such owner or occupier within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice informs the authority that he will himself do the cleansing and disinfection to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health within a time fixed in the notice. If within twenty-four hours from the receipt of the notice the person to whom it is given does not inform the authority that he will so do the cleansing, &c., or if, having so informed the authority, he fails to have the work done within the time fixed in the notice, the work shall be done by the officers of the local authority under the superintendence of the Medical Officer of Health. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the owner or occupier in a summary manner. Where the owner or occupier is unable effectually to cleanse and disinfect, the officers of the local authority, with the consent of the owner or occupier, may do the work at the cost of the authority, without the notice already referred to being given. 5 (The advantage gained by this section is that the clerk to the local authority will have express statutory direction for his action in giving notice, and will not need specific authority. Delay will be prevented, since the officers will be able to proceed to cleanse and disinfect, if, twenty-four hours after the owner or occupier has received the notice, he has not informed the authority that he will do the work to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. But the Vestry must consider that as yet they have not provided a disinfecting chamber as a part of their sanitary machinery.) Section 17. For the purpose of carrying Section 5 into effect the local authority may, by any officer appointed in that behalf, who shall produce his authority in writing, enter any premises between the hours of 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Section l5 provides that, if it be necessary for the members of a family to leave their dwelling, so that it may be efficiently disinfected by the local authority, the local authority must provide them, free of charge, with a temporary shelter or house accommodation, and any necessary attendants. (This is a provision which would seem to require the early attention of the Vestry.) Section 6 provides that the Medical Officer of Health may, by notice in writing, require the owner of any infected bedding, clothing, &c., to cause the same to be delivered to and removed by an officer of the local authority, for purposes of disinfection. The articles, after disinfection, are to be taken back and delivered to the owner, free of charge. (Penalty for failure to comply with the above requirement not to exceed £10.) Section 7 deals with the reletting of a house or part, after infectious disease has been in the house. It is intended for the protection of persons entering upon occupation. But the protection is limited, as the penalty (not exceeding £10) for failure to disinfect, and for omission to give notice to the owner, is not incurred should the outgoing tenant vacate the house six weeks after it has been occupied by a person suffering from an infectious disease. Presumably, however, the case would be dealt with by the local authority in connection with the Notification Act, and it is the duty of 6 the said authority, if they are aware that there is a person suffering from an infectious disease in any house to give notice of the provisions of the section (7) to the occupier. Section 11, makes a person guilty of an offence, under the Act) who hires or uses a public conveyance (other than a hearse), for the conveyance of an infected body, without notifying the fact to the owner or driver. Further, the owner or driver will be guilty of an offence under the Act if, after receiving such notification, he does not provide for the disinfection of the vehicle. Sections 8 to 10 deal with the retention, removal, and burial of dead bodies. After death from an infectious disease, a body may not be retained elsewhere than in a public mortuary, or in a room not used at the time as a dwelling place, sleeping place, or workroom, for more than 48 hours, without the sanction, in writing, of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a registered medical practitioner (Section 8). Section 9 is intended to provide for the burial, direct from the hospital, &c., of any person who may die therein of an infectious disease. The body, however, may be removed to a mortuary. The penalty for an offence under this section, which is made operative by the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health, or of a registered medical practitioner, is not to exceed £10. Should the infected body remain unburied, elsewhere than in a mortuary or in a room as above-mentioned (8), for more than 48 hours, without medical sanction, or should any dead body be retained in a house so as to endanger the health of the inmates, any justice may, on the application of the Medical Officer of Health, order the body to be removed, at the cost of the local authority, to any available mortuary, and direct the same to be buried within a time limited in the order. A justice, moreover, may direct the immediate burial of an infected body, or of any dead body the immediate burial of which he may consider necessary. Should the friends or relatives of the deceased in any of the above cases not undertake to bury the body within the time limited by the order of the justice, it will be the duty of the Relieving Officer to bury such body, and the Guardians may recover the expenses incurred, in a 7 summary manner, from any person legally liable to pay the expenses of the burial (Section 10). Section 12 provides for the detention in a hospital by the order of a justice and at the cost of the local authority, of an infectious person who is in the hospital, and would not, on leaving the hospital, be provided with lodging or accommodation in which proper precautions could be taken to prevent his spreading the disorder. Section 16 deals with penalties. For offending against an enactment where no penalty is specifically imposed. For example, the offence of wilfully obstructing the duly authorised officers of the local authority or of obstructing the carrying out of any order of a justice, the penalty is not to exceed £5 ; and if the offence is a continuing one a daily penalty not exceeding 40s. a day, so long as the offence is continued, is incurred. Penalties will be recoverable in a court of summary jurisdiction on the information or complaint of the local authority or of their duly authorised officers, but not otherwise. The amounts are to be paid to the local authority (Section 18.) All which is submitted. GEORGE LANCASTER, Chairman, Sanitary Committee. Vestry Offices, Upper Street, N. 10th November, 1890. VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPOINTED OCTOBER 17th, 1890, TO CONSIDER The relations between the Vestry and the Churchwardens, Pursuant to the following Resolutions, viz.:— "That a special committee of twenty members, together witli the three "churchwardens for the time being, be appointed to take into consideration the "resolutions of the Vestry of October 23rd and 30tli, 1874; the manner in which "those resolutions have been carried into effect; and any other matters bearing "upon the relations between the Vestry and the churchwardens; and to report "whether any, and, if so, what changes are desirable." "That the following be and they are hereby appointed such Special Com"mittee:—Mr. Churchwarden Elliott, Mr. Churchwarden Eayson, Mr. Churcli"warden "Watts, Messrs. Wm, Adams, Barfcram, Buckell, Camps, Cufflin, "Friend, Furlong, Hollyman, Johnson, Lavy, May, Minasi, Mote, Eumbelow, "Sargant, Saunders, Smith, Spring, Thompson, and John Young." Printed by order of the Committee. WM. F. DEWEY, Vestnj Cleric. LONDON: Chas. Straker & Sons, Avenue Works, BisnorsGATE Avenue, E.G. 1891. To the Vestry of St. Mary, Islington. The Special Committee appointed on October 17th, 1890, to consider the relations between the Vestry and the Churchwardens, begs to report as foMows :— It has held six meetings for the consideration of the matters referred to it by the Vestry. At its first meeting Dr. Buckell was appointed Chairman, and submitted a statement which he had prepared as to the past history of the relations between the Churchwardens and the Vestry, and also an abstract of the Churchwardens' general accounts from 1875-6 to 1889-90. These, together with a copy of the Case submitted to Counsel in 1874 and of his Opinion thereon, were ordered to be printed for the guidance of the Committee and will be found among the appendices to this report. The Committee proceeded in the first place to take into consideration the expenses of the Churchwardens under the several headings set forth in the "Abstract of Accounts " in the order therein adopted ; and subsequently dealt with the mode in which the monies necessary to meet the civil expenditure of the Churchwardens should be provided by the Vestry and with the audit of their accounts. The duty of preparing and printing each year a list of persons liable to serve on juries devolves upon the Churchwardens and Overseers pursuant to 6 Geo. IV., cap. 50, s.s. 8 and 9, as amended by 25 and 26 Vict., cap. 107, sec. 6. The expenses in connection therewith are directed to be repaid by the parish or township, and by 7 and 8 Vict., cap. 101, sec. 60, it is enacted that they shall be defrayed out of the poor rate. The Committee is informed that in Islington the list has always been prepared by the Vestry Clerk from the rate-books under the authority and direction of the Churchwardens, the accounts for work done being paid by the Senior Churchwarden when certified as correct by the Vestry Clerk. The resolution of the Vestry of October 30th, 1874, on this subject (Appendix F) gave no instructions as to the rate to which jury-list 4 expenses were to be charged; up to 1875-6 they were defrayed out of the Churchwardens' rate, and since that time they have been paid out of the general rate. The Committee submits a resolution on the subject (No. 2, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Bell-ringing The Committee considers that it is within the discretion of the Vestry to determine whether the ringing of the bells of the Parish Church and of the Chapel-of-Ease on occasions of public rejoicing or mourning shall be paid for out of the rates or not. The custom of bell-ringing on such occasions is one which the Committee believes to be in full accord with public sentiment, and, as Counsel in 1874 advised that expenditure for this purpose was legal, provided the ringing was not preparatory to Divine Service, the Committee is of opinion that the Vestry should pay for such ringing out of the rates. As some doubt has been expressed whether the Vestry has power to charge expenses of this nature upon the general rate, the Committee calls attention to s.s. 92 and 161 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120), which give a very wide discretion to the Vestry in determining what expenses may be defrayed out of that rate. The Committee submits a resolution on the subject (No. 3, Appendix F), which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Insurance of Bells. The attention of the Committee having been called to the charge for insurance of the bells against fire which has appeared in the Churchwardens' accounts since 1874, it has come to the conclusion that the insurance of the bells must be treated as a part of the general insurance of the buildings, and cannot therefore be legally paid for out of the rates. It submits a resolution on the subject (No. 4, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Public Clocks. The existing clock was placcd in the tower of the Parish Church in 1875 by the Vestry, its cost being defrayed out of the general rate. In 1877 the clock in the tower of the Chapel-of-Ease was cleaned and repaired at the expense of the ratepayers. The maintenance of these clocks in good working order is so obviously a matter of public convenience and utility, that the Committee has no hesitation in advising that the cost thereof be defrayed out of the rates, and submits a resolution on the subject (No. 5, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. 5 The Parish Churchyard was closed for burials by an Order in Council dated April 1st, 1853, a copy of which is attached (Appendix D). At the time of the passing of the resolutions by the Vestry on October 30th, 1874, the responsibility for maintaining the ground in decent order and for doing the necessary repairs of the walls and other fences thereof devolved upon the Churchwardens pursuant to the Burial Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vic., cap. 128, sec. 18), and the expenses incurred by them in so doing were by the same section directed to be repaid out of the poor rate. In March, 1884, an agreement (Appendix E) was entered into between the then Vicar (Rev. Daniel Wilson) and the Vestry under the provisions of the Open Spaces Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Vic., cap. 34) to the effect that the said churchyard should be for ever an open space accessible to the public and under the control of the Vestry. The necessary Faculty having been obtained, the work of 1 tying out and improving the ground (the cost of which was defrayed by the Vestry) was commenced in September, 1884, and the ground was opened to the public on May 16th, 1885. Consequent upon this taking over of the ground by the Vestry the responsibilities of the Churchwardens under the Burial Act ceased, and the expenses of maintaining the ground became chargeable to the general rate. It thereupon devolved upon the Vestry to determine to whom the care and maintenance of the ground should be entrusted, and on March 20th, 1885, the Vestry resolved that the ground should be placed under the supervision and control of the Churchwardens. The Committee is of opinion, having regard to the proximity of the ground to the Parish Church and to the possibility of annoyance being caused to the worshippers in the Church by disorderly behaviour on the part of persons in the ground, that this arrangement should not be disturbed. It submits a resolution providing for the expenses of maintenance (No. 6, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Parish Churchyard The Chapel-of-Ease Burial Ground was closed for burials by the same Order in Council as the Parish Churchyard (Appendix D), but the order reserved " the right of interment, with proper precautions, in private vaults" therein. Since the closing of the ground up to the present time the same obligations under the Burial Act, as were mentioned in connection with the Parish Churchyard, have devolved upon the Churchwardens in regard to it. On May 13th, 1870, a resolution was passed by the Vestry (vide p. 24) which led to the laying out of the ground and to Chapel-ofEase Burial Ground. 6 Print ing of Accounts an 1 Miscellaneous Expenses attending I lie Office of Churchwarden. its being opened to the public as a recreation ground. As such it lias been maintained by the Churchwardens up to the present time to the great benefit of the public, the expenses having been defrayed out of the general rate. The Committee believes that the Vestry is unanimous in desiring that, with as little delay as possible, this ground should be placed in the same position, under the Open Spaces Act, 1881, as the Parish Churchyard. It is, however, necessary until this is accomplished, to make provision for the expenses of keeping it in decent order and of the necessary repairs of the walls and fences thereof, which are properly payable out of the yoor rate, and for the expenses connected with its maintenance as a recreation ground, which are properly payable out of the general rate. The Committee accordingly submits two resolutions on the subject (Nos. 7 & 8, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. The senior Churchwarden is required by Section 3.5 of the Islington Local Act, 1824 (5 Geo. IV., cap. 125) to have his audited account printed; this, therefore, is an expense over which the Vestry has no control. Admission Pees. The nature of the miscellaneous expenses attending the office of Churchwarden is indicated in the "Abstract of Accounts " (Appendix B). The first item under the head of miscellaneous expenses which occupied the attention of the Committee was the charge in connection with t lie admission of I he Churchwardens. The Committee has ascertained that it is required not only by ecclesiastical law (canon 118) but also by statute (5 & 6 Win. IV., cap. 62, sec. 9) that the Churchwardens should be admitted by the Ordinary before their legal title to discharge the duties of their office is complete. Fees are only demandable on such occasions by custom,but they have been paid for so long a period by the Churchwardens of Islington that, in the opinion of the Committee, such custom has become establishe 1 and the fees are an expense incurred by the Churchwarden "by virtue of his office" which may properly be defrayed out of the rates. The fees payable are regulated by the table of fees settled by the Archbishop of Canterbury and others, and published in the London Gazette of March 19th, 1869, under the provisions of 30 &. 31 Vic., cap. 135, and amount in the aggregate to eighteen shillings. The Committee is of opinion that no expenses in connection with the admission of Churchwardens beyond these fees should be charged to the rates. The Committee is of opinion that Visitation Fees ought not to be 7 charged to the rates inasmuch as the visitation is a purely ecclesiastical function. It is also of opinion that no expense in connection with registers relating to a later date than 1837 ought to be charged to the rates. It therefore recommends the Vestry to affirm these opinions by adopting the resolution (No. 9, Appendix F) submitted by the Committee. Attention was called to the item in the account for 1888-9, " Expenses of election of Organist for Parish Church." The Islington Local Act 1832 (2 Wm. IV, cap. 26, sec. 19) places the election of the organists and pew-openers of the Parish Church and Chapel-ofEase in the hands of the occupiers of lands, &c., in the district of St. Mary. The Committee is of opinion that until this section is repealed the expenses of carrying it out must be defrayed out of the rates; it considers, however, that the repeal of the section is very desirable as the authorities of the respective churches are obviously the proper persons to appoint such officers, and therefore submits a resolution on the subject (No. 10, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Election of Organist. The Committee also submits a resolution (No. 11, Appendix F) with reference to printing and miscellaneous expenses, which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Printing, &c. Having dealt with the various expenses attaching to the office of Churchwarden the Committee next proceeded as before stated to consider the mode of providing the money necessary to meet those expenses. The resolutions of the Vestry of October 30th, 1874, directed the Accounts Committee to pay the amounts necessary to meet the expenses of carrying them out to the Senior Churchwarden upon his requisition; and it has been the custom since 1879 for the Senior Churchwarden to make, from time to time, a requisition for a round sum of money "pursuant to the several resolutions of the Vestry of October 30th, 1874," the Committee is unable to recommend the Vestry to adhere to this practice, being of opinion that all applications for money should in the first instance be presented to the Vestry. The Committee feels that it would be unjust to call upon the Churchwardens to advance money to meet the legal expenses attending their office and that it is therefore necessary that money should be advanced to them from time to time, but it is of opinion that the course followed in 1878-9, as shown in the Chairman's Mode of providing for Churchwardens' Civil Ex penditure. 8 statement (p. 13) suggests the proper mode of procedure, and that the requisition of the Senior Churchwarden, though it may still be for a round sum of money, should apportion that sum to the several purposes indicated in the resolutions which the Committee has in the earlier portions of this report recommended the Vestry to adopt. It is the more important that this course should be taken inasmuch as, without such an indication, it is impossible for the Finance Committee to determine what proportion is to be charged upon the poor rate, and what proportion upon the general rate. The Committee submits a resolution upon this subject (No. 12, Appendix F) which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. Audit of Accounts, The last question which occupied the attention of the Committee was as to the amount of control over the details of the Churchwardens' expenditure that can be exercised by the Vestry or by ratepayers. As regards the audit of the accounts, it is enacted by the Islington Local Act, 1824 (5 Greo. IV, cap. 125, sec. 35) that the Senior Churchwarden shall within one month after his going out of office submit his accounts and vouchers to the Auditors appointed under the authority of the Act; by the next section the Auditors are required to audit such accounts 'within one month after they shall have been made wp and delivered, to them. Upon the passing of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, the audit of the accounts of the Churchwardens was transferred by sec. 197 to the Auditors elected under that Act. The Committee would direct the attention of the Vestry to the enactment contained in this section to the effect that such audit shall be conducted in the same manner as the audit of the accounts of the Vestry. By section 195 it is provided that the latter audit is to take place in the presence of any members of the Vestry, ratepayers or creditors on the rates who desire to attend; that the Auditors shall hear any complaint made by any ratepayer or creditor who is present touching the accounts; that the Auditors shall have full power of allowance or dis-allowance of any item; and that the accounts when audited must be signed by the major part of the Auditors. The Committee is of opinion that though no specific provision, such as is contained in the Acts relating to the audit of poor-law accounts, is made in this Act for public notice being given of any of the audits established by these sections, such notice is implied by the requirement that the audits shall be conducted practically in 9 public as before stated. The Committee is informed that it is the practice to place a notice of the audit of the accounts of the Vestry outside the Vestry Hall, and thinks the same course should be adopted in connection with the audit of the accounts of the Churchwarden. The Committee submits a resolution on the subject of audit (No. 13, Appendix Fj which it recommends the Vestry to adopt. In conclusion the Committee, believing that the resolutions which in this report it has recommended the Vestry to adopt will place the relations between the Vestry and the Churchwardens upon a more satisfactory footing than that established in 1874, recommends the Vestry to revoke the resolutions of October 30th, 1874 ; and in accordance with Bye-laws 2 and 3, has directed the Vestry Clerk to convene a special meeting of the Vestry on January 23rd, 1891, for that purpose, and for the purpose of taking into consideration this report and the resolutions which the Committee therein submits to the Vestry. Revocation of resolution of 1874. All which is submitted. Signed, FRANCIS JOHN BUCKELL, Chairman. 10 APPENDIX A. STATEMENT SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE AT ITS FIRST MEETING BY ITS CHAIRMAN. IN enquiring into the history of the relations between the Churchwarclens and the Vestry, a convenient starting-point will be found in the year 1824, in which year was passed the local Act known as 5 George IV., cap. 125. In this Act it is provided by s. 33, that the Vestry of the Parish shall among other rates, make one "for payment of the annuities "and other expenses for the building, repairing,and service of the Chapel"of-Ease which rate shall not exceed in any one year two-and-six" pence in the pound; and also one other rate for the purpose of repairing "upholding and re-building the Parish Church, in part or in whole,and "in defraying the expenses incurred by the Churchwarden, by virtue "of his office or by order of the Vestry." It is further enacted by s. 34, that the latter rate shall be paid to "the senior Churchwarden for the "time being, and applied by him in such manner as the rates heretofore " made for the said purposes have been applied." By section 35, the person who shall have been senior Churchwarden of the Parish for the past year is required "within one month after his going out of "office for the said year, to deliver unto the auditors appointed under "the authority of the Act" (who were also the assessors), " a just and "true account or accounts, in writing, of all monies which he shall have "received or paid on account of his said office, and shall produce and "show all the vouchers of and for the payments by him charged to "be made and the said account shall when so audited be made "out, transcribed, printed and laid before the Vestry together with "all other accounts herein directed to be printed for the use of the said "Parish. This Act was amended in 1832 by an Act known as 2 William IV., cap. 26, which by s. 3, in place of the two rates mentioned above substituted "one rate for payment of the annuities heretofore granted on raising monies for building the said Chapel-of-Ease," and 11 for payment of the monies theretofore borrowed for the purpose of building certain district Churches; one rate to be called the Churchwardens'Rate for payment of "the annuities heretofore granted for “raising monies for purchasing the new Burial Ground of the Parish, "and for defraying all expenses incurred or to be incurred by the "Churchwardens of the Parish for the time being by virtue of their "office, or by order of the Vestry (except such of the same expenses "as are othorwise provided for)"; and a third rate, to be assessed on the district of St. Mary " for repairing upholding and rebuilding "the Parish Church and the Chapel of Ease, and for providing "furniture for the same respectively (except the ordinary or "annual repairs, otherwise provided for)." This Act by s. 7, also varies the application of the profits derived from the Stonesfield Estate which are directed to be divided into four equal parts—one of which is to be paid to the senior Churchwarden for the time being of the Parish of St. Mary, Islington, and the other three to the Churchwardens of each of the three then exist ing district Churches. The amount received by the senior Churchwarden was to be applied in defraying the incidental expenses of carrying on Divine Worship in the Chapel-of-Ease, and these incidental expenses are defined as insurance, wine, warming, lighting, salaries of organists, beadles, and pew openers, and other incidents of the same or a like nature, and in the next place in defraying the expensesof the ordinary or annual repairs of the Chapel-of-Ease. Prior to this Act, all the profits arising from the Stonefields' Estate had been expended, by virtue of an Act (51 Greorge III., cap. 216), in payment of all expenses attending the repairing and keeping in repair, and ornamenting the Parish Church of St. Mary, Islington, and attending the office of Churchwarden, and any surplus remaining was to be used in erecting and building, and keeping in repair the Chapel-of-Ease, then about to be erected and built. In section 17, it is enacted that the mortuary money and fees arising from the burial grounds attached to the Parish Church and the Chapel-of-Ease, except such parts thereof as the Vicar, Clerk, and Sexton of the Parish shall be entitled to, shall, after paying thereout the expenses on insuring the Church and the Chapel-of-Ease, from damage by lire, to be carried to the credit of the Churchwardens' Rate. Section 19 provides for the appointment of the Beadle of the Chapel-of-Ease, and of the organist and pew openers of the Parish Church and the Chapel-ofEase by the occupiers of lands, etc., within the district of St. Mary, at the Vestry to be held on Easter Tuesday in each year or at such other 12 times as may be required by the death, resignation, or removal of any of such officers. The Islington Parish Acts Amendment Act, 1857 (20 and 21 Vic., cap. 118), provides, in section 21, that the Churchwardens' Rate and the rate for repairing, etc., the Parish Church and the Chapel-of-Ease, shall be levied and paid by the Vestry as constituted under the Metropolis Management Act (1855) to the senior Churchwarden of the Parish for the time being. This proviso seems never to have been literally carried out— the practice having been to pay to the senior Churchwarden the sum or sums which he requisitioned, and to keep any balance remaining over in the hands of the Vestry to the credit of the Churchwarden's Rate Account for the following year. A Churchwardens' Rate continued to be made until 1874. In 1808 the Compulsory Church Rate Abolition Act was passed. The gist of this Act was that no proceedings could in future be taken to compel the payment of any Church Rate; a Church Rate is defined as any Rate made for Ecclesiastical purposes, and Ecclesiastical purposes are defined as "the building, re-building, enlargement and repair of any Church or Chapel, and any purpose to which by common or Ecclesiastical law a Church Rate is applicable." Little heed seems to have been taken of this Act at first, the Churchwardens' accounts for several years continuing to show expenditure out of the Churchwardens' Rate for purposes which were eventually declared to be Ecclesiastical. At length in 1874 the assertions of Vestrymen and others that illegal and improper items were being charged to the Churchwardens' Rate reached such a head that the Vestry on June 19tli referred it to the General Purposes Committee to enquire and report whether such was the case—subsequently giving the Committee power to take counsel's opinion. A case was accordingly laid before Mr. Barrow, and this, together with Mr. Barrow's opinion thereon, is printed herewith. Before the Committee reported, however, Mr. Pickford and some other ratepayers, acting apparently upon a suggestion made by an anonymous correspondent in the Islington Gazette, refused to pay the Churchwardens' Rate, and were summoned on August 24th before the local Justices, who, notwithstanding the strong advocacy of the then Vestry Clerk, Mr. Layton, in favour of the legality of the rate, declined 13 to decide on the legal points raised, but agreed to sign a warrant in the case of Mr. Pickford, pro forma, in order that the case might be taken to a superior court for decision. In the case of the other defaulters, they declined to sign warrants till Mr. Pickford's case was decided. No further legal action however was taken. The Report of the General Purposes Committee was presented to the Vestry 011 its re-assembling after the recess, and was considerd by it on the 23rd and 30th October, 1874, when after considerable discussion, the resolutions now in force were adopted. As a result, several items which had hitherto been charged to the rates ceased to be so charged. As has been already mentioned, the last Churchwardens' Rate was made in 1874: the amount then collected appears to have been sufficient to meet the needs of the Churchwardens for the year 1875-6 and 1876-7. The year 1877-8 is the first in which the expenses incurred by the Churchwardens, pursuant to the resolutions of the Vestry of October, 1874, were paid out of the General Rate. In that year two requisitions were made by the senior Churchwarden; one, accompanied by details, was for the exact amount of the expenses incurred in the preparation of the Jury List, and this appears as a separate item in the Vestry Accounts; the other was for a lump sum (£150), to meet the expenses of the Churchwardens' General Account. In the following year, 1878-9, the course of events is very interesting. On June 3rd, 1878, three separate requisitions were made—one for a sum of £50 towards the expenses of keeping the Chapel-of-Ease ground in decent order: another for a sum of £50 towards keeping the Parish Churchyard in decent order, and a third for a sum of £100 for payment on the Churchwardens' General Account. On July 20th two separate requisitions were made—one for a sum of £50 for keeping the Parish Churchyard in decent order, and another for a sum of £50 for keeping the Chapel-of-Ease ground in decent order. On November 7th, one requisition was made for a sum of £50 for payments Churchwardens' General Account balance of expenses preparing Jury List. On March 10th, 1879, two separate requisitions were made—one for a sum of £50 to keep the Parish Churchyard in decent order, and another for a sum of £50 to keep the 14 Cliapel-of-Ease recreation ground in decent order. On May 8th, 1879, the same Churchwarden makes a final requisition for a sum of £36 2s. 6d. for the expenses of payment of bell-ringers and repairs of parish clocks. In the following year, 1879-80, a requisition was made on June 24th, 1879, for the sum of £200, on account of expenses of Churchyards and Chapel-of-Ease grounds. On the 16th September, a requisition was made for the sum of £200, "pursuant to the several resolutions of the Vestry of October 30th, 1874." From that time forward the requisitions are for round sums of money, without any information or estimate as to the details of the expenditure to which the money is to be applied, other than that furnished by the general formula as shown above on the 16th Sept., 1879.

COPY OF CASE SUBMITTED TO MR. BARROW IN 1874, AND OF HIS OPINION THEREON. The Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, is a Vestry constituted under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 120, and 2o and 2G Vic., cap. 102. There are also in Islington, Local Acts, 2nd William IV., cap. 26, and 20 and 21 Vic., cap. 118. Questions have recently been raised in the Vestry, as to the propriety and legality of making a "Churchwardens' Rate" to meet feveral of the items contained in the Churchwardens' Account, under the heading "General Account," and it was referred to a Committee of the Vestry, on the 19th June, 1874, by the following Resolution:— "That it be referred to the General Purposes Committee, to ascertain "and report whether there are any improper or illegal items charged to the "Churchwardens' Rate, and to recommend thereon." 20 The Committee recommended the Vestry to take the opinion of Counsel for their guidance, and the Vestry resolved— "That the Vestry Clerk be authorised to obtain the opinion of Counsel "on a case to be prepared by him, setting forth amongst other matters, the "several items in the Churchwardens' Account which have been objected to." A printed copy of the Churchwardens'Account is sent herewith, and Counsel's attention is directed specially to "The General Account."' The items objected to as being "improper" if not "illegal" seem to be those for " labour and materials and repairs at tho Parish Burial Grounds " (which have been closed for several years under the Burials Acts), tho remuneration and clothing for a man placed in the old Churchyard (which is a public thoroughfare) to take care of the yard, painting the iron railings there, rent of house in the Chapel-of-Ease Ground, in which the Chapel-of-Ease Beadle resides (this person is also an Oflicer of the Vestry of the Parish, being a Lamp Inspector, and from the time of the erection of the Chapel about 50 years ago, the Beadle has resided in the house rent free, but there seems to be no resolution of the Vestry for this purpose). Bell ringing on days of Public rejoicings. These Charges have for years and years past been included and charged as shewn in tho printed account now sent. The Beadle at the Chapel-of-Ease is appointed by the inhabitants of St. Mary's District of the Parish, Sec. 19 of 2nd William IV., cap 26, and by Sec. 7 of the same Act, the incidental expenses of carrying on Divine Worship in the Chapel-of-Ease are defrayed out of the portion of the Stonetield Estate awarded for that purpose, and out of the Stonetield rents and a salary of £20 a year are paid. The items which is said are "illegal" are those in the "General Account," as follows: — Insurance of the Parish Church. Tfce like Chapel-of-Ease. Clothes for Beadle. Work in tho Church Ground. Repairing the Church Bells. Winding up the Clocks in the Steeple and Tower of the Church and Chapel. Ringing the Parish Church Bells. Kent of Beadle's House at the Chapel-of-Ease. The Sexton's Salary, £50 a year. Asa matter of fact all the charges alleged to be improper and illegal have always heretofore been charged in the Churchwardens' Account. With reference to the Sextons salary, it was arranged by the Vestry in 1855,when the Burial Grounds were 21 closed, that he should be paid £50 a year in lieu of fees (see 15 and 16 Sees, of the 20 and 21 Vic., cap. 81). The Sexton is annually elected by the Vestry, and the same person has been re-elected and £50 a year paid to him for many years. It is admitted on all hands that the other items contained in the Churchwardens' Accounts, namely, those in connection with the Jury Lists, See., are quite correct. Before the passing of the Burials Act, a portion of the Mortuary fees was payable to and received by the Churchwardens; and by the Islington Local Act 2nd William IV., cap. 26, Sec. 17, that portion received by the Churchwardens was directly charged with the expenses of insuring the Parish Church and Chapel-of-Ease from damage by fire. Now all the fees are paid to the Burial Board and any balance that Board may have at the end of the year is paid to the Vestry in aid of the Poor Rates. It will be observed in reference to the Churchwardens' "General Account" that credit is still given for Mortuary receipts, viz., for tolling the Parish Church bells and for the rent of the Sexton's late residence, but these scarcely cover the insurances. It is contended by some persons that the insurances should be paid out of the pew rents of the Parish Church and the Chapel-of-Esse. By the Islington Local Act the pew rents of the Church are paid to the Churchwardens for defraying the expenses of carrying on Divine Worship and for defraying the expenses of the ordinary and annual expenses of the Church. Pew Rents of the Chapel-of-Ease are paid to the Minister, which is the whole of his emoluments. Upon reference to the 18th Sec. of the 18 and 19 Vic., cap. 128 (Burial Act) it would seem that the obligation to keep closed Parish churchyard grounds is cast on the Burial Board, and if so, any objection to the Churchwardens doing so and making the payments can easily hereafter be remedied by the Burial Board directly carryingout the necessary works or for the Churchwarden to continue to do so, the Burial Board recouping the expenses to the Churchwarden. The inhabitants generally have not refused to pay the rate. Some dozen of them may have done so. The annexed copy of letter marked A has been sent to a few ratepayers in answer to their requests to know what items were charged to the Churchwardens' Accounts. The Churchwardens' Accounts are audited by the Auditors of the Parish, appointed under the Metropolis Local Management Act. There is a District Churches Rate referred to in the letter A. The interest of this Debt is paid direct by the Vestry, the Churchwardens having nothing to do with it. This debt is secured by mortgages, no time being fixed for payment. It is presumed they could be compelled to take their money, on reasonable notice being given for that purpose. An Act was passed on the 31st July, 1868, 31 and 32 Vic., cap. 109, intituled " An Act for the abolition of compulsory Church Rates." to which attention is directed 22 This Act does not abolish making the Church Rate, but abolishes the enforcement of payment of a Church Rate. The Local Justices feel a difficulty in enforcing the Rate, and have written the folio iving letter. Islington, 7th August, 1874. Dear Sir, Has the opinion of Counsel been taken whether the various iteni3 in the Churchwardens' Rate are without doubt within the exceptions specified in the 2nd Sec. of the Church Rates Abolition Act 1868, or will such an opinion shortly be taken. We have already been called upon to sign Sumnnnses to defaulters, but we should hesitate to grant Warrants for recovery of the Rates, if there should be any doubtful items in the Churchwardens' Rate. If an opinion has been taken we should be glad to see the case and opinion before hearing the su mmonses. We, are, Dear Sir, You is truly, J. B. PRICE, J. Layton, Esq., RICH!). HAZARD. Vestry Clerk, Islington. The attention of counsel is especially directed to the Churchwardens' Account, the Islington Local Acts (left herewith), the Abolition of Church Rates Act, and to the Burials Act, and he is requested to advise the Vestry for its guidance hereafte as well as for the guidance of future Churchwardens; whether any, and, if any, which of the charges are, in his opinion, improper to be charged in the Churchwardens' Account; and if improper in that Account, whether they can properly bj included in the "General Account " of the Vestry. Whether any, and, if any, which of the charges are "illegal," and in what respect, and if illegal to what Account they can be properly charged. In fact, are any of the charges within the meaning of the Compulsory Church Rate Act, 31 & 32 Vict, cap. 100. Whether any, and, if any, which of the charges are payable by the Burial Boar J Are tho pew rents of the Parish Church and Chapel-of-Ease liable for payment of the insurance of those buildings, and should the buildings not be insured and be destroyed by fire, would any liability attach to the Churchwardens for the nonineurance, and who would be liable to build the Church and Chapel. All parties are, it is believed, willing if it can be legally done, to transfer the charges to the General Account of the Vestry, so that the items might be included in and collected as part of that rate. Counsel will please advise whether that course can be adopted, the Churchwarden by requisition from time to time calling upon the \estry for payment. To advise the Vestry and Churchwardens generally. 23 OPINION. I think that the following items, viz.:—Insurance of Oliurch and Chapel, Work in the Church Ground, and Sexton's Salary, are now properly chargeable on the Burial Board. As to the Insurance—this, by the Local Act, 2nd William IV., cap. 26, Sec. 17, was made a charge on the "Mortuary money " therein mentioned, and therefore by the 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 85, Sec. 26 (sic)*, it is one of the periodical liabilities which the Burial Board, at the request of the Churchwardens may (and, I think, must) pay. I think the Pew Bents are not liable. The Work in the Church Ground seems to be provided for by the 18 and 19 Vic,, cap. 128, Sec. 18, and the Sexton's Salary by the 15 and 16 Vic., cap. 85, Sec. 37. I do not think these items could be included in the General Account of the Vestry. I think that the repair of the bells is an item within the 31 and 32 Vic., cap. 109 not that the item is illegal, but that its presence in the accounts would render it impossible to enforce the payment of a rate to defray the expenses set out in the accounts. A distinction has most properly been drawn in the case between an item which is in itself illegal and one which renders the rate incapable of enforcement. I think that the repair of the church bells is an item that would before 1868 have been properly chargeable upon a Church Bate, and therefore to be directly within the interpretation clause. I think the ringing of the bells to be an item which the Vestry may incur and charge to the Churchwardens' Rate under the 3rd section of the Local Act, provided it is not preparatory to Divine Service. Winding up the church and chapel clocks I think is also an item which the Vestry may deal with under that section, and I think the same as to the clothes and house for the beadle. But I come to this conclusion entirely from the 3rd section of the Local Act, which seems to give very large powers to the Vestry as to charges which may be placed upon the Churchwardens' Rate. I do not think that without this section the power of the Vestry to incur these expenses would be by any means clear, and I cannot lecommend that anj- attempt should be made to support the charges under any other statute, or to charge to any other rate. I have now only one question more to reply to, and that is as to the liability of the Churchwardens to make good any damage to the Church, &c., by fire. I do not think that the Churchwardens incur any personal liability in this respect. There is no doubt that the Parishioners at Common Law would be liable to the charge, but since the Statute of 1868, it is not ensy to gee how that liability could be enforced. Mr. Prideaux's very able work, "The Churchwardens' Guide, p. 314 and 399, 12 Edit., 1871, contains some suggestions on the point which seems to be the production of a Mr. Swann ; I am not, however, at all prepared to say that they could in practice be carried into effect. FRANCIS BARROW, Temple, 14th August, 1874. *This should evidently be Sec. 36. 24 Understanding that the charges for ringing the Bells are incurred in respect of ovations of Public rejoicing, and are not in any way connected with Divine Service. I think that the whole of the charges, including the care of the clocks (except those which I have pointed out as properly falling on the Burial Board), are unobjectionable' and that the .Justices may safely enforce the payment of the Churchwardens'rate' under the 20 and 21 Vic., cap. 118, See. 14. They would of course be qualified in any event if the Vestry were to consent to indemnify them. FRANCIS BARROW, Temple, 20th August, 1874. Addendum to Case for opinion of Counsel in re The Vestry and Churchwardens of St. Mary, Islington, and the Churchwardens' Rate. It was omitted in the caso submitted to Counsel on the 8th inst., to specially direct his attention to the words in the 2 William IV., c. 26, s. 3 (copy of Act deposited with case), enacting that a "Churchwardens' Rate "may be made and signed 'for payment of the Annuities heretofore granted for raising moneys for purchasing "the new Burial Ground of the said Parish, and for defraying all expenses incurred "or to be incurred by the Churchwardens of the said Parish for the time being by "virtue of their office or by order of Vestry (Except such of the said expenses as are "otherwise provided for under the provisions hereinafter contained)," and to the fact that the Vestry did on May 13th, 1870, pass the following resolution:— "That in the opinion of this Vestry it is very desirable that the ground attached to the Chapel-of-Ease should to some degree be rendered available as an open space for the benefit of the Parishioners, that at the least the broad path between the llolloway Road and the Liverpool Koad might be opened under proper regulations as a promenade, similar to that on Islington Green; they therefore request the Churchwardens to confer with the Vicar on the subject, and do authorise them, with his sanction, to carry into effect the wishes of the Vestry;" and that the Churchwardens have since carried out the directions therein contained, and do at present maintain the Chapel-of-Ease closed Burial Ground as a Recreation Ground at the expense of the Vestry, which expense is met and defrayed out of the Churchwardens' Rate. Counsel will please advise as to the legality of the Rate so far as this item is concerned and generally as to its effect upon the whole question. Dated 10th August, 1874. OPINION. I think this also is an item the Vestry have the power to control, under the 3rd Sec. of the Local Act. F. B. 25 APPENDIX D.
