Belcher 2 MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Hayes, Middlesex. May, 1958. To the Chairman and Members of the Council, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, The incidence of infectious disease in 1957 was greatest during the early part of the year. As forecast, there were 1,324 cases of measles, but fortunately most of them were of only moderate severity and without complications. There were also 66 cases of Sonne dysentery, affecting chiefly school children in the northern part of the district. The source of infection was not found, but spread appeared to be by contact between the children; examination by swabbing of water closet# seat$, chains and doors yielded no evidence of contamination. There was a return to the pre 1954 level of whooping cough, 148 cases being notified. Since the number of children being immunised against this disease continues to rise, it would seem that doctors are now notifying extremely mild cases, which in other years would have escaped their attention. Certainly since immunisation became popular, whooping cough has not been accompanied by the severe complications which used to occur. Influenza of the Asian strain reached the district in September and spread swiftly involving all age groups. The epidemic lasted a few weeks only, but there were 7 deaths, chiefly of elderly or debilitated persons. A specific vaccine was prepared nationally, and offered to those specially exposed to risk i. e. medical and hospital personnel , ambulance staff, etc. The vital statistics remain much as they were last year 3 but the infant death rate shows a further decrease. This is a satisfactory trend, but is off set by an alarming rise in the still birth rate, and indicates that we cannot as yet afford to be complacent about the standard of antenatal and intrapartum care. Although there has been an increase in both the number of inhabited houses and in the estimated population of the district, the two have not kept pace, and this means that the housing problem has not been alleviated at all. While little statutory overcrowding exists in the district, there are far too many families living in exceedingly cramped conditions and it is little wonder that mental strain is rife at all ages. Delegates from this Authority attended a one day Conference on Cancer Education in January. The material presented was excellent, and aroused much interest. It is a common fault of medically trained people that they fail to realise that the untrained know less than themselves about disease, but would benefit by some information. The intelligent man in the street still does not realise that cancer is not inevitably a killing disease, and that many people have been treated and cured. Opponents of cancer education cite as their main argument the disastrous effects (notably suicide) of fear of cancer. The number of people thus affected is small, and where it is impossible to suit everyone, the guiding rule should be the greatest good of the greatest number., One of the chief weapons against any hazard is knowledge and it seems ridiculous to imagine that this is not applicable to medicine perfect knowledge casteth out fear. Following on the introduction of the Clean Air Act steps were taken to draw up a plan of smoke control areas which would cover the entire district in 10 years. With the eager backing of the Council, and the co operation of the public this work has proceeded well, and a detailed account of it will be found in the Chief Public Health Inspector's report. In connection with the clean air campaign a smoke exhibition was staged at the Council's Dele gate Conference held in November. The exhibition attracted a large number of visitors who took advantage of the expert advice available and asked many questions. 4 I have again shown the age incidence of deaths from certain diseases. This time deaths from heart disease pre dominate in all age groups over 49 years. It is inter esting to note that between 50 and 69 years over half the male deaths from malignant disease were due to cancer of the lung. I would like to thank the staff of the Public Health Department for their support during the year, and the mem bers of the printing section for their work on this report and I should like to record my appreciation of those mem bers of the Council who have taken a special interest in Public Health during the year. I am. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant. V. SHAW. Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (acres) 5, 159 Population (Census - 1951) 65608 Population (raid year 1957 Registrar General's estimate of civilian population) 67 190 Number of inhabited bouses at 31st December 1957 19,222 Rateable value (estimated) as at 31st December 1957 £1,044414 • Product of penny rate £4,207 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS OF THE YEAR Live Births M F Total Birth rate per Legitimate 518 526 1;044 1000 of the Illegitimate 14 10 24 estimated popu- lation 159 Comparability Factor is 094 giving a corrected birth rate of 149 Birth rate for England and V,'ales 161 Birth rate for County of Middlesex (corrected) 138 Stillbirths M F Total Rate per 1000 Legitimate 14 14 28 total (live & Illegitimate - - still) births 256 Infant Deaths M F Total Legitimate 6 S 14 Illegitimate 1 - 1 Death rate of infants under one year of age (a) All infants per 1000 live births 140 (b) Legitimate infants per 1 000 ^legitimate live births 134 (c) Illegitimate infants per 1000 illegitimat live births 417 Death rate of infants under one year of age in the County of Middlesex 17 7 6 Deaths M F Total Death rate per 273 232 510 1.000 of the estimated popu- lation. 7.6 Comparability Factor is 1.62 giving a corrected death rate of 12.3 Death rate for England and Wales 11.5 Death rate for County of Middlesex 10.9 Death from Puerperal causes Maternal Mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 total (live and still) births) Maternal Mortality rate for County of Middlesex 0.4 BIRTH AND DEATH RATES, ETC.

Harlington Cottage Hospital. Sipson Lane, Harlington for maternity cases. Beds are available at hospitals within a few miles of the district for treatment of most conditions including mental disease and infectious disease. Ambulance Service This is provided by the Middlesex County Council for the conveyance of all cases to hospital and one ambulance is based in Hayes; other ambulances operate from Hillingdon Hospital. Tuberculosis : There has been a further small decrease in the number of new cases notified during the year, although the number of deaths has risen slightly. The Chest Clinic is situated in Uxbridge and is open on certain evenings for the benefit of workers. Provision for treatment is made at Harefield Hospital. Child, Welfare Clinic etc. The Maternity and Child Welfare services are adminis tered by the Middlesex County Council. The district is well supplied with clinics as in addition to three clinic buildings, sessions are held regularly in the mobile clinic at three points and in three church halls. Immunisation and 7accination Vaccination against poliomyelitis has continued apace and elsewhere will be found details of the numbers of children in this district who have received two injections. Although the recommended ideal is a course of three in jections. the policy in this country has been to give a large measure of protection to the greatest possible number of children, and preliminary results show that this was in fact achieved. It is probable that the children already vaccinated will be offered a third injection when supplies permit. The work has been carried out in the main at the 10 clinics, but some local general practitioners have also taken part in it. The number of children immunised against diphtheria and whooping cough is of the same order as last year, and shows the continued popularity of the combined prophylactic. There is however, an increase in the number of children immunised against whooping cough only, this reflects the change in Ministry policy, whereby the use of combined prophylactics is being discouraged. This has the advantage that infants can receive protection against whooping cough at the optimum age i.e. under 6 months, but they are then subjected to a total of 5 or 8 injections as compared with 3 when a combined prophylactic is used. In view of the fact that cases of smallpox are still reported quite frequently in this country, it is heartening to notice an increase in the number of persons of all ages vaccinated against the disease. Although one hopes that this increase is due to a genuine desire for protection, the number of international certificates of vaccination presented for signature is a suspicious circumstance and raises the question as to whether compulsion of a different kind has replaced the old regulations. The figures set out in the tables on page 12 giving details of diphtheria and whooping cough immunisation and vaccination against smallpox and poliomyelitis, were given by courtesy of the Area Medical Officer. Water Supply: Apart from a small area in the south which is supplied by the South West Suburban District Water Company the dis trict's water supply comes from the Rickmansworth and Uxbridge Valley Water Company. One property is supplied by a well owing to its distance from a main source of supplyDuring the year 18 samples have been taken and with the exception of one sample of well water, all were of a satisfactory standard. Medical Examination of Council Staff: The total number of examinations carried out during 1957 was 167. Of these 34 were for Superannuation purposes alone. 31 for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme. 5 8 for Sick Pay and Superannuation and 44 for various special purposes. 11 12 AGE 1 Number of Children Who Completed a Full Course of Primary Immunisation Number of Children Who Received a Secondary (Reinforcing) Injection Persons Vaccinated or Re- Vaccinated Diphtheria Only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough Whooping Cough Only Diphtheria Only Combined Diphtheria and Whooping Cough VJhooping Cough Only Vaccination Re-Vaccination Under 1 28 626 12 _ 704 1 11 160 2 - - - 17 1 2-4 14 58 3 51 107 - 64 14 5-14 35 14 3 723 168 1 104 49 15 & over - - - - - - 141 263 TOTAL 88 858 20 774 275 1 1.030 327 Total 1956 141 843 3 1 012 536 - 627 195 Total 1955 91 650 21 536 298 5 573 107 Total 1954 176 777 34 848 187 8 584 279 TUBERCULOSIS New Cases and Mortality during the year, 1957 Age Periods New Cases Mortality Respiratory NonRespiratory Respiratory NonRespiratory M F M F M P M F Under 5 years 1 - 1 - - - - - 5-14 1 1 - - - - - - 15 - 24 3 2 1 1 - - - - 25 - 44 14 8 - - - 1 - - 45 - 64 10 4 1 - 2 2 - - 65 & over - - - 1 1 - - - Age unknown - - - - - 1 1 - TOTALS 29 15 3 2 3 4 1 - TUBERCULOSIS 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 New Cases 101 88 73 59 51 49 Deaths 12 8 11 12 5 8 13 NOTIFIABLE DISEASES (OTHER TSUAN TUBERCULOSIS) DURING THE YEAR, 1957 Disease Notified cases confirmed Deaths Scarlet Fever 42 - Whooping Cough 148 - Acute Poliomyelitis - & Encephalitis 4 - Measles 1,324 - Dysentery 66 - Meningococcal infection 4 - Pneumonia 68 35 Erysipelas 5 - Pood Poisoning 14 - Puerperal Pyrexia 12 - INCIDENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Disease 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 Scarlet Fever 144 84 52 117 88 42 Pneumonia 79 101 42 60 82 68 Diphtheria 0 0 0 0 0 0 Meningococcal Infection 4 2 0 1 2 4 Puerperal Pyrexia 16 12 6 6 9 12 Erysipelas 2 7 8 6 4 5 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 3 0 0 0 0 0 Measles 680 938 75 1,154 77 1,324 Whooping Cough 143 257 73 59 87 148 Dysentery Group 25 1 12 0 14 66 Poliomyelitis and Encephalitis 14 7 1 22 6 4 Food Poisoning 4 0 1 8 21 14 14 15 ANALYSIS OF TOTAL CASES Disease AT AGES Under 1 yr. 1 2 3 4 5-9 10-14 15-24 25 & over Age unknown TOTALS Scarlet Fever 2 _ 2 4 7 14 11 1 1 — 42 Whooping Cough 10 11 11 19 17 64 10 4 2 - 148 Acute Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 Measles 31 113 138 151 228 629 16 6 4 8 1,324 Dysentery 2 3 3 5 3 25 5 2 17 1 66 Meningococcal Infection 2 ~ — — ~~ 1 1 4 AT AGES Disease Under 5 yrs 5-14 15-44 45-64 65 & over Age unknown TOTALS Pneumonia 6 8 22 22 9 1 68 Encephalitis - 1 2 - - - 3 Erysipelas - - 2 3 - - 5 F'ood Poisoning 2 8 2 1 1 - 14 Puerperal Pyrexia - - 11 - - 1 12 POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATION Number of Children who have received two injections (up to 3.1.st December, 1957).

The year was notable for the progress made under the Clean Air Act, certain provisions of which came into force on the 31st- December, 1956, and also for the passing of one of the most controversial measures for many years, The Rent Act, 1957, and its subsequent implementation. At this stage it is difficult to say whether or not the Rent Act is likely to achieve its object of preventing the deterioration of dwellings. One's first impressions were that more external decorating was being done to rented property than usual but it is doubtful whether many landlords have made more than a cursory attempt at properly overhauling and reconditioning their property. When the rent of a dwelling is increased its valuation also increases and with it the amount which a notice under Section 9 of the Housing Act can require a landlord to spend on repairs and still keep within the bounds of "reasonable expense". It is in this direction, I feel, that the Act has the greatest possibilities. By inspecting, in a systematic manner, all rented houses in the district a good state of repair could be ensured. So far as our limited staff resources permit this is being done but the rate of progress is necessarily very slow. To obtain the greatest benefit from the new situation that the Rent Act has created would require additional staff and on present salary levels it is doubtful whether more inspectors could be recruited even if the Council were prepared to do so. But that is another story. No time was lost in implementing those provisions of the Clean Air Act which came into force on the last day of the previous year. Full details of the progress achieved are given in another part of this report. I would, at this stage, like to thank the Council for the wholehearted support they have given me in this matter. The substantial increase in work caused by new 17 lation could not have been carried out without the willing co operation of the clerical and technical staff of the Department and I wish to record my appreciation of their efforts. My report on the work of the Public Health Inspectors is set out under the following six headings - I. Sanitary Administration, viz - inspection of the district. complaints, notices served, legal proceedings, offensive trades, drainage, keeping of animals, rodent control, ponds, ditches and watercourses. II. Air Pollution, viz smoke control areas, height of chimneys, new furnaces, byelaws re new heating and cooking appliances, measurement of pollution, publicity, III. Pood, viz milk supply, ice cream, inspection of meat and other foods, food hygiene, hawkers of food, sampling of food and drugs, food poisoning, inspection of food premises, IV. Housing, viz inspection, repair, demolition, closure, overcrowding. Improvement Grants, Certificates of Disrepair, moveable dwellings, new houses, V. Factories and Shops, viz. inspection of factories, defects found, outworkers, inspection of shops, VI. Miscellaneous duties, viz:- Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. Rag plock & Other Pilling Materials Act, Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. Pet Animals Act, Agriculture (Safety. Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956. Public Health Acts Amendment Act. 1907 (Dealers in old metal). I am Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient Servant, JOHN S. ilODGINS. Chief Public Health Inspector. 18 PART I. SANITARY ADMINISTRATION Inspection of the District. Visits to dwelling houses re disrepair, nuisances etc. 1,885 Visits to dwelling houses re overcrowding and rehousing enquiries 256 Visits re Improvement Grants 63 Visits re Certificates of Disrepair 193 Visits re defective dustbins 229 Visits re defective drainage 1,288 Visits re disinfection & disinfestation 138 Visits re accumulation of refuse and refuse tips 213 Observations re smoke, noise and smell nuisances 486 Visits re Clean Air Act 933 Inspections of public conveniences 117 Inspection of piggeries, stables etc 197 Inspections of moveable dwellings and caravan sites 937 Inspections re infectious diseases 915 Visits re Shops Act (during normal office hours) 1,466 Visits re Shops Act (outside normal office hours) 1,055 Visits re inspection of food 389 Inspections of dairies and milk shops 42 Inspections of ice cream manufacturers premises 31 Inspections of ice cream dealers premises and vehicles 302 Inspections of food shops, cafes etc 2,648 Inspections of licensed premises 132 Inspections of hawkers' vehicles and store places and mobile canteens 186 Inspection of factories, workplaces and outworkers premises 690 Inspections re rodent control 1,447 Inspection re music and dancing licences 40 Visits re sampling of milk, water, ice cream and other foods 143 Interviews with builders, owners etc Inspections of petroleum stores 251 Inspections of slaughterhouses Inspections of ditches, watercourses, etc 185 Inspection of schools Miscellaneous visits 1,329 "No Access" visits 1,934 Total 21 013 * Miscellaneous visits include Visits re Fireguards Regu- lations, Pet Animals Act, Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, Scrap Metal Dealers, etc. 19 In the past it has been suggested to me that such a large number of visits as is shown in the foregoing table can only be achieved by failing to give proper care and attention to the inspections involved. I feel therefore that an analysis of these visits would be worth while. The table shows that 1,934 visits were "no access" visits i.e. visits to premises to which access could not be gained, and a further 1,055 were Shops Act visits outside normal office hours. This leaves 18,024 effective visits or inspections during normal office hours of which 17,409 were made by the five inspectors who have districts. The average for each inspector is therefore 3,482. Assuming there are 229 full working days in a year (i.e. 52 x 5-day weeks, less 24 days holiday and 7 days sickness) this gives an average of just more than 15 visits or inspections per man per day. Some of these e.g. re visits to ascertain whether dustbins have been supplied or minor repairs carried out take very little time and in other cases inspections under two or three different Acts may be carried out on the same premises. For statistical purposes these must be recorded under each of the separate Acts for which an inspection is made. Furthermore as all inspectors have "essential user" car allowances very little time is wasted on travelling. It can be seen therefore that ample time is given to all visits and inspections. If more time were devoted to each visit it follows that less frequent visits would result, and from a public health point of view it is far more valuable to have frequent inspections of moderate duration rather than less frequent inspections of longer duration. The fact that an inspector is likely to call at frequent intervals is, in itself, an incentive to the maintenance of satisfactory standards. The old military maxim "What is not inspected, deteriorates" is very apt. Complaints. During the year 1,141 complaints were received as compared with 1,055 last year. The increase is accounted for by considerably more complaints about defective dustbins and rats and mice. There was however a significant decrease of 96 complaints about insanitary or dilapidated houses. 20 Summary of Complaints. Choked and defective drains 334 Insanitary or dilapidated conditions of houses or premises 110 Offensive accumulations or deposits 20 Defective dustbins 183 Vermin or insects 51 Gypsies 18 Rat and mouse infestations 296 Unsound Pood Nuisances from animals 6 Overcrowding 45 Other nuisances 29 Total 1,141 Notices Served- Informal Notices served 403 Statutory Notices served: Public Health Act, 1936, Section 39 26 -do- Section 45 2 -do- Section 56 1 do- Section 75 6 do Section 81 1 -do- Section 93 46 Legal Proceedings. (a) Food and Drugs Act, 1955 (i) Proceedings were taken against a baker for the selling of a loaf containing a considerable quantity of machine oil. He was fined £10 and ordered to pay 3 guineas costs. (ii) Proceedings were taken against another baker for selling a loaf which contained a cigarette end. He was fined £5 and ordered to pay 3 guineas costs. (iii) Proceedings under the pood Hygiene Regulations were taken against a street trader for exposing food lower than 18" from the ground. He was fined £2 and ordered to 21 pay 1 guinea costs. The trader in question has not been seen in the district since the proceedings were taken. (b) Public Health Act, 1938 (i) Proceedings were taken on two occasions against persons who were exchanging articles for rags. Both defendants were fined £1 each and one was ordered to pay half a guinea costs. The persons in question have not been seen in the district since the proceedings were taken. (ii) Proceedings were taken against a property owner for failing to comply with an Abatpnipnt Notice. The defendant was ordered to abate the nuisance within 28 days and ordered to pay 3 guineas costs. The work was carried out within the period stated. Offensive Trarles. It was found that two general scrap dealers had ex tended the scope of their business to include rags. The sources from which some of these rags were obtained subgested that they might be in an offensive condition, bringing these activities within the provisions of the Public Health Act for offensive trades. In both cases the premises concerned were satisfactory and application?for consent to carry on offensive trades were granted for a period of one year. The Local Authorities to which the rags collected by these traders are sent have been notified in order that proper control of their disposal can be exercised. There are no other establishments in the district carrying on an offensive trade. Drainage. Fifteen cesspools and ten pail closets were abolished during the year, leaving 46 cesspools and 24 pail closets in use. The following figures show that further progress will 22 be difficult and will depend on the owners of premises with cesspool drainage in category A being willing to accept the Council's offer to undertake a connection to the sewer on payment by the owner of 50% of the cost. Similar encouragement is given to the substitution of water closets for pail closets by maximum grants, i.e. 50% under Section 47 of the Public Health Act, 1936. Cesspools Pail Closets A. Within 100 ft. of an existing accessible sewer 17 5 B. Within 100 ft. of a possible sewer extension 5 - C. No sewer likely to become available 24 17 D. Likely to be demolished soon - 1 Totals 46 23 Pail closets and cesspools are emptied regularly by the Engineer & Surveyor's Department. The practice of clearing stopped drains free of charge, where this can be achieved simply by rodding or plunging, was continued and nuisances from this cause thereby reduced to a minimum. Keeping of Animals. Byelaws under Section 81 of the Public Health Act to control the keeping of pigs, horses and cattle are in force. They deal with the structural condition and cleanliness of premises in which these animals are kept, boiling of swill, drainage, the storage of manure etc. and have proved of considerable assistance to the Public Health Inspectors in their efforts to minimise nuisances from this source. The 23 prevention of nuisances however is of less importance than the prevention of disease and by preventing conditions under which flies breed the risk of diseases which they are known to spread viz. dysentery, typhoid, paratyphoid and epidemic diarrhoea, and poliomyelitis, which they are suspected of spreading, can be reduced to a minimum. Rodent Control. Treatment at dwelling houses is carried out free, but a charge based on the cost of labour and materials is made for treatment at business and industrial premises. All complaints are investigated by the Public Health Inspectors before treatment is carried out in order to find out whether the infestation is the result of defective drains, accumulations of refuse, improper keeping of animals etc. Ditches, undeveloped sites, rubbish dumps and other places where infestation is likely to occur, are subject to regular routine inspection. The sewers were test baited at 150 points in all parts of the area for the presence of rats. Infestation was found in only one small part of the district and poisoning quickly eliminated the trouble at this spot. During the year 354 treatments were carried out at dwelling houses and 234 at business premises. Ponds, Ditches, Watercourses, Etc. These sites are regularly inspected for rodent infestation, pollution, general nuisances and, particularly in summer, mosquitoes. When adverse conditions are found remedial action is taken. PART II. AIR POLLUTION (a) Smoke Control Areas Last year I reported that the Council had approved in principle the establishment of Smoke Control Areas and had agreed to my suggestions for the method of their introduction. 24 A further step forward was achieved when, early in the year, the Council adopted a 10 year programme to cover the whole of the Urban District with Smoke Control Areas. The estimated cost of this programme to the Council will be equivalent to slightly more than 1d. rate for each year of its 10 years duration. The District has been divided into 43 Smoke Control Areas and in accordance with the method of introduction already agreed the first few areas were intended to cover the undeveloped and sparsely populated parts of the district in order to ensure that these areas would remain non-producers of smoke. The table below shows that there were not many houses in the first six areas dealt with. All other areas however will contain between 500 and 1,000 houses. By the end of the year six Smoke Control Areas had been declared the the following progress achieved: Area No. Area in Acres Dwellings Other Buildings Order Operative Remarks Council Others 1 240 – 3 23 1.6.58 Order confirmed 2 350 – 10 8 Approved in principle by Ministry 3 265 - 55 13 1.9.58 Order submitted for confirmation 4 440 138 9 18 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle 5 376 2 90 19 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle 6 - - - - Deferred until 1958 7 357 254 102 18 Details submitted to Ministry for approval in principle 25 So far all work on Smoke Control Areas has been absorbed into the normal routine of the Department but pro vision has been made for the engagement of additional staff as soon as the detailed survey of the larger areas has to be undertaken. The detailed survey of a Smoke Control Area includes visiting every house in the area, examining the grates and fireplaces, deciding which are capable of burn ing coke, what alteration or adaptation will be required to those in regular use not already capable of doing so and estimating the cost of the work. When considering the question of additional staff for this work one's first inclination is to think in terms of more Public Health Inspectors. But when it is appreciated that apart from such personal qualities as tact, courtesy and enthusiasm for clean air the major part of the work involved in a detailed survey can be done by anyone with a thorough knowledge of flues, fireplaces and domestic heating appliances it is clear that the field of recruitment for this temporary job is fairly wide. (b) Height of Chimneys By arrangement with the Engineer & Surveyor all plans of new buildings or extensions are passed to me for a decision on this particular point. During the year two plans were examined for this purpose and the proposed chimneyheight was found to be inadequate in both cases. It has sometimes happened that a height which would be necessary to comply with the Clean Air Act was not acceptable on town Planning grounds. In cases like this a form of heating is usually adopted that either does not require any chimney at all or one of less height than that originally proposed. Builders and architects are now showing an increasing tendency to discuss this matter with me before submitting plans. (c) New Furnaces Under Section 3 of the Clean Air Act all new furnaces must, so far as practicable, be capable of being operated without emitting smoke and anyone who installs a new furnace must notify the local authority of his intention to do so. If the plant is installed in accordance with plans and specifications submitted to and approved by the local authority it is deemed to be capable of operation without emitting smoke. 26 During the year six notifications of new furnaces were received. In every case the attention of the firm concerned was drawn to the facilities for obtaining prior approval but no application was received. (d) New Buildinq Byelaw Re Heating and Cooking Appliances A new building byelaw, provided for in Section 24 of the Clean Air Act, has been adopted by the Council. This applies to dwellings in much the same way that Section 3 (see above) applies to larger buildings i.e. it requires that new dwellings should be provided with heating or cooking appliances which are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, oil or solid smokeless fuels. (e) Publicity The readiness with which the people of this District have accepted the Council's programme for smoke control is no doubt partly due to the publicity which has been given to this subject in recent years in the local press and by our own efforts. Atmospheric pollution took a prominent part in a Public Health Exhibition in 1953. the mobile exhibition of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation was shown in the district in 1955, further prominence was given to it in a display describing the work of the Public Health Inspector shown at the Delegate Conference in 1956 whilst at the 1957 Delegate Conference an exhibition devoted entirely to Clean Air was shown. Arrangements have been made to hold a comprehensive clean air exhibition at the Town Fete in 1958. (f) Pollution from Road Vehicles There is a difference of opinion about the potential danger to health of the exhausts from petrol and diesel engines respectively. There can however be no doubt that as a source of nuisance, the badly adjusted or badly driven diesel engine is by far the greater offender. The admission of avoidable smoke from road vehicles is an offence under the Road Traffic Act which is administered by the police. When unsatisfactory conditions are observed the offender is notified in writing and in most cases a co operative reply is received. 27 (g) Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution Three stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the daily volumetric method are in use. The pollutants measured are smoke and sulphur dioxide. Last year I reported that the method of measuring smoke was not sufficiently accurate to warrant publication of the figures. An electric reflectometer has now been obtained for assessing smoke stains and the figures obtained are thought to be sufficiently accurate for inclusion in this report. The measuring station at William Byrd School is situated in fairly close proximity to the Bath Road and London Airport but is a considerable distance away from any source of smoke particularly in a southerly direction the station at the Civil Defence Headquarters is in the centre of the town where it is likely to receive the full effect of in dustrial pollution, the station at Grange Park School is in the middle of a modern residential area.

FOOD Milk Supply. A register of Dairies and Milk Distributors (other than dairy farms and farmers) is maintained and the numbers shown on the Register are: Milk Distributors 21 Dairies 6 The following licences have been issued Designation Dealers Licences Supplementary Licences Tuberculin Tested 10 10 Pasteurised 11 10 Sterilised 16 12 29 An order made under Section 37 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, specifying this district as one within which the use of special designations in relation to milk sold by retail is compulsory, is in force. During the year thirteen samples of pasteurised milk were taken for bacteriological examination, twelve passed the prescribed tests but one failed to pa.ss the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests and was referred to the licensing authority, the Middlesex County Council. Two licences were issued by the County Council in respect of the use of the special designation "Pasteurised" for milk processed within the district. These premises were regularly inspected by officers from the County Council who took 77 samples of pastuerised milk, all of which were satisfactory. In addition twenty-four samples of raw milk were taken in the district by officers of the Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli; all gave negative results. It has not been necessary to take any action under Article 20 of the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, to prohibit the sale of milk. Ice Cream. One hundred and fourteen premises are registered for the sale of ice cream in the district, including fourteen which are registered for its manufacture. The methods of heat treatment laid down in the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations are used by all persons manufacturing ice cream in the district. fifty six samples of ice cream and five samples of lollies were obtained and taken to the Public Health Laboratory. Ealing, for bacteriological examination. The use of the new standard described in last years report, has been continued and is, for convenience, set out below:- Grade I II III IV Count below 500 500-10,000 10,000-100,000 Over 100 000 Faecrl Coli Nil Nil Nil or Present 30 The grading of samples taken was as follows- Ice Cream Lollies Grade I 14 or 25% Grade I 3 or 60% Grade II 27 or 48% Grade II 2 or 40% Grade III 7 or 12½% Grade III — Grade IV 8 or 14½% Grade IV - The proportion of ice cream samples falling into Grades III and IV is slightly better than last year, i.e. 27% against 30%; but last year 25% of lolly samples fell into these grades whilst this year none was graded below Grade II. The number of lolly samples was however much smaller this year than last. All vehicles from which unwrapped ice cream is sold are equipped with wash basins and carry supplies of hot water, soap, towels and nail brushes. The Inspection of Meat and Other Foods. The two licensed slaughterhouses in use are proving more than adequate for the needs of the district. Details of the animals slaughtered and diseases found are set out on page 32. The inspection of meat in slaughterhouses, which is carried out to the standards laid down in Memo. 3/Foods, resulted in the condemnation of 842 pounds of carcase meat and 33 pounds of offal, whilst in retail shops. 573 pounds of raw meat and 2,856 pounds of tinned meat were condemned. The following foods (other than meat) were also condemned during the year: Pish 467 lbs. Fish (tinned) 26 lbs. Tomato Puree (tinned) 496 lbs. Tomatoes 13½ cwts. Tomato Ketchup 38 lbs. Salad Base 5 cwts. Salad Dressing 452 lbs. Sandwich Spread 330 lbs. Cake 10 lbs. Spice 400 lbs. Cheese 22454 cwts. Cheese Spread 6354 lbs. Vegetables (tinned) 139 lbs. Fruit (tinned) 38½ cwts.

Small quantities of condemned foods are buried on the Council's refuse tip. New byelaws relating to sanitary conditions and management of private slaughterhouses came into operation on the 1st May. They are based on the Model Byelaws but strengthen them by making provision for (a) hanging accommodation for meat outside the slaughtering or dressing room, (b) covered accommodation for the storage of manure, (c) the taking of all reasonable precautions to prevent access by domestic birds or animals not intended for slaughter into the slaughter houses. Five slaughtermen's licences were issued. One application for a licence was refused because the Council were not satisfied that the applicant was a fit and proper person. The words 'fit and proper' in the context of the Slaughter of Animals Act are regarded as having a wider meaning than mere competence as a slaughterman. Food Hygiene. Much attention has again been given to this important subject. As a result of the structural improvements carried out to food premises under the Pood Hygiene Regulations the main field of activity in food hygiene is now the education of food handlers. It has been found that this is most effective when done on the spot by the Inspectors during their visits to food premises. Pull use has been made of the propaganda posters issued by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Pood and the Central Council for Health Education. Large numbers have been exhibited in places where they will do most good i.e. factory canteens, school kitchens, civic restaurant, food factories, etc. Byelaws made under Section 15 of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1938, have been in force in the district since July, 1950. 33 The Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries & Food's long awaited Codes of Practice for food handling have still not been published and consequently a revival of the Food Hygiene Guild has not been attempted. The Guild, as formerly con stituted. was made redundant by the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, which laid down standards higher than those specified in the Guild's Codes of Practice. The Ministry's Codes of Practice will, it is expected, lay down standards with which conscientious food traders, such as those who were members of the Guild, would be willing to comply. It would be possible of course to formulate our own Codes but as the official ones have been imminent for two years and will presumably be issued with the blessing of national trade associations it does not appear that there is much to be gained by doing so. ilawkers of Food. The registration of hawkers of certain classes of food has been compulsory in this district since 1939 and immediately after the Middlesex County Council Act. 1950, came into force the Council adopted Section 11 of the Act to extend the registration of hawkers to cover all classes of foodstuffs. The vehicles and storage premises used by these traders are regularly inspected by the Public Health Inspectors and have to comply with the Food Hygiene Regu lations. Sampling of Food and Drugs. (a) Miscellaneous foods, such as shell-fish, cream cakes, watercress and meat products are regularly sampled by the Public Health Inspectors for bacteriological examination. Although there are no recognised standards of bacteriological quality for these classes of food the results are of considerable assistance to the Inspectors in their contacts with food-handlers, illustrating, as they often do. that the greatest care is necessary in the storage and handling of this class of food. The bacteriological examination of samples of milk, ice cream, water and miscellaneous foods is carried out at the Public Health Laboratory. Ealing, and I am indebted to the Director and Staff of the Laboratory, for their ready assistance at all times. Details of the samples submitted will be found elsewhere in this report under their respective headings. 34 (b) The sampling of food and drugs for chemical analysis is carried out by the Middlesex County Council and the following information regarding samples obtained during the year has been kindly supplied by the Senior Public Control officer.

The twenty one unsatisfactory samples of new milk were all deficient in milk fat and solids-not-fat. They were procured from three consignments sent by three different dairy farmers to processing depots in your district. In no case was there any evidence of added water and in the case of two of the suppliers other samples from the same consignment were found to be genuine and no further action was called for. In the case of the third dairy farmer, I wrote to him drawing his attention to the low quality of his milk and I also informed the Milk Marketing Board of the circumstances in order that the dairy farmer might have the benefit of the Board's Advisory Service. Canned Fruit. A tin of peaches was sampled and the label of the container bore a statement relating to sugar content which was ambiguous and therefore likely to be misleading to a purchaser. The statement referred to "45% sugar syrup" and it was not certain whether this related to the sugar content of the syrup or to the proportion which the syrup content bore to the whole contents of the tin. The importer's attention was drawn to this ambiguity and an undertaking was received that a suitable amendment would be made to this statement. Sausages. A sample of pork chipolatas were found to contain an undeclared preservative in an amount which would have been permissible had its presence been disclosed. A subsequent sample was found to be genuine and no further action was called for. Sweets. A sample of sugar confectionery described as "Pineapple Chunks" was found not to contain any ingredient derived from pineapple; the flavouring used was artificial. An official caution was addressed to the person concerned." Food Poisoning. Fourteen cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. One due to Salmonella and thirteen to Shigella sonnei. 36 Inspection of Food Premises.

Work on the clearance of unfit houses was recommenced in May and by the end of the year the programme originally planned for 1957 had been almost completed. The routine inspection of houses under the Housing and Public Health Acts was carried out throughout the year so far as the staffing position allowed. Inspection of Housing during the year. 1. (a) Total number of dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Acts) 185 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 1,515 2. (a) Number of dwelling houses which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations 1925 and 1932 165 (b) Number of inspections made for the purpose 205 3. Number of dwelling houses found to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation - 4. Number of dwelling houses (exclusive of those referred to under the preceding sub-heading) found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 224 Remedy of Defects etc., during the year without the service of Formal Notices. (a) Number of dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers 174 (b) Number of dwellings in respect of which vol untary undertakings not to re-let on termination of present tenancy were given 38 (c) Number of unfit dwellings closed in pursuance of voluntary undertakings (d) Number of unfit dwellings demolished voluntarily 3 Action under Statutory Powers during the year (1) Proceedings under Sections 9, 10 and 16 of the Housing Act 1936 (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring repairs (b) Number of dwelling houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices (i) by owners (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners (2) Proceedings under Public Health Act 1936 (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which notices were served requiring defects to be remedied 60 (b) Number of dwelling houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices: (i) by owners 37 (ii) by Local Authority in default of owners (3) Proceedings under Sections 1.1 and 13 of the Housing Act. 1936 (a) Number of dwelling houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made or undertakings given 2 (b) Number of dwelling houses demolished in pursuance of Demolition Orders 6 39 (4) Proceedings under Section 12 of the Housing Act 1936. (a) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were made – (b) Number of separate tenements or underground rooms in respect of which Closing Orders were determined, the tenement or room having been rendered fit – (5) Proceedings under Section 25 of the Housing Act. 1936. (a) Number of Clearance Areas declared 5 (b) Number of unfit dwellings included in Clearance Areas 17 (c) Number of unfit dwellings in Clearance Areas demolished 14 (6) Proceedings under Local Government (Miscell– aneous Provisions) Act. 953 (a) Closing Orders made under Section 10(1) 4 (b) Number of dwellings closed 3 Overcrowding. At the end of the year 30 dwellings were overcrowded, i.e. 0.16% of the total dwellings in the district. The average number of occupants for each inhabited house in the district is the same as last year 3.50. the lowest since 1939 when the figure was 3.44. This figure, together with those given in the previous paragraph, shows that over crowding is not a serious problem in the district. Improvement Grants. Although in most instances the Council have made maximum grants of 50% the provisions of the Housing Act, 1949, for Improvement Grants have created little interest in he district. During the year only two applications were 40 received; in one case a grant of 50% was made and in the other the application was approved in principle and detailed specifications, drawings and estimates invited. Certificates of Disrep air. The Rent Act, 1957, came into operation in July and applications for Certificates of Disrepair began to come in during September, The procedure for dealing with applications under the new Act is much more complicated than under the 1954 Act and entails considerably more work in the Department both by the Inspectors and the clerical staff. By the end of the year sixty four applications for Certificates of Disrepair had been received and had been dealt with as follows:- Refused Landlords notified of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepair (Form J) 57 Undertakings given by landlords to remedy defects (Form K) 41 Certificates of Disrepair issued 9 Applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair refused 1 Moveable Dwellings, It is six years since I first referred in these reports to the proposed municipal caravan site and I am happy to report that the project has now become a reality. Con struction was commenced in October 1956 and the first cara vans moved on to the site in June 1957. There is accomraodation for 95 caravans and the standard of amenities is of a high order the site is served by properly drained tarred roads, every van has a hard standing and paved path, there are ample water supply points and slop disposal points and an ablution block that contains water closets, wash basins and baths, and deep sinks for laundry purposes. After the site was fully occupied a report was presented 41 to the Council on the unauthorised sites still in use. It was decided to take action under the Town Planning Act in preference to the Middlesex County Council Act and at the end of the year action was still pending. New Houses. During the year the following dwellings were completed by the Council and private developers Council Houses 19 Old Person's dwellings – Flats 156 Maisonettes 38 Private Development Dwellings 230 Housing Association Dwellings 4 PART V. FACTORIES AND SHOPS Factories Act, 1937 There are one hundred and sixty eight factories with mechanical power and five factories without mechanical power on the Register, with a range of products including Aircraft, building materials, caravans, carbon products, cheese, chocolate, cocoa, coffee extracts, electrical transformers, furniture, lubricating oil, optical lenses, radio, radar, television, gramophone records and gramophones, rubber, tarmacadam. and wood block floors. 42 Inspection of Factories Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted Factories with mechanical power 168 266 13 - Factories without mechanical power 5 6 - - Other premises under the Acts (including work of building and engineering construction, but not including outworkers' premises) 9 123 2 - Total 182 395 15 - Defects Found. Particulars Number of Defects Found Remedied Sanitary accommodation (Section 7) Insufficient 3 3 Unsuitable or defective 12 10 Not separate for sexes - - Other offences - - Total 15 13 43 Outworkers. Part VIII of the Factories Act requires the occupier of a factory who employs persons to carry out certain classes of work in their own homes to supply a list of such persons to the District Council every six months. Seventy six notifications were received and 147 inspections made; in every instance the work was found to be carried out under suitable conditions. Shops Act. All parts of the Shops Act are administered, including hours of closing, assistants' half holiday, Sunday trading, comfort and welfare of assistants, etc. The Act applies to 628 premises in the district and the Public Health Inspectors made 2,521 visits including 1,055 outside normal office hours, i.e. in the evenings and on Sundays. As a result 4 informal notices were served but in no instance was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings. For the convenience of shopkeepers a stock of the statutory forms which they are obliged to display on their premises is held in the Public Health Department. PART VI. MISCELLANEOUS Petroleum (Regulation) Acts. These Acts apply not only to the storage of petrol but to petroleum mixtures, cellulose solutions, other oils and calcium carbide. During the year 107 licences were issued in respect of:- 122,570 gallons of petroleum spirit and mixtures, 44,705 gallons of cellulose solutions, 896 lbs. of calcium carbide, 955 gallons of other oils. The Council have adopted the latest recommendations of the Home Office for the electrical equipment and installation in connection with petrol pumps and this work is checked on my behalf by a suitably qualified officer in the Engineer and Surveyor's Department. 44 During the year 251 visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to ensure that the requirements of the Acts were complied with and two minor infringements were dealt with by warning letters. Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act. Although upholstery is carried out at several premises in the district all but one, on account of the type of filling used, fall outside the scope of the Act. These premises are registered and were visited twice during the year. The other premises used for upholstery and similar trades are also visited occasionally so that if circumstances change and a type of work to which the Act applies is undertaken, the provisions of the Act can be enforced. Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act. This Act makes it compulsory for new gas. electric and oil heaters to have suitable guards fitted. Such appliances are sold at 28 shops in the district and 22 visits were made to these premises by the Public Health Inspectors in the enforcement of the Act. Pet Animals Act. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that pet animals are sold under conditions which do not expose them to cruelty or unnecessary discomfort. Four premises are licensed under the Act and 21 visits were made by Public Health Inspectors to secure complaince with the conditions of the licence. No contraventions were found. Agriculture (Safety. Health & Welfare Provisions) Act, 1956 Sections 3(1) and 5 of this Act. relating to the provision and maintenance of sanitary conveniences for agricultural workers are enforced by the Public Health Inspectors and parts of the district are still sufficiently rural to provide a use for these provisions. 45 Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907. Section 86 of this Act, requiring dealers in marine stores and scrap metal to be registered with the local authority, has been adopted by the Council. Registered premises, of which there are four, are visited from time to time and the records which are required to be kept, inspected.
