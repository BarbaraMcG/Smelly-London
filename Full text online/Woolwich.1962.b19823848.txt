WOO62 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1962 BY T. STANDRING, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WOOLWICH ANNUAL REPORT on the Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich for the Year 1962 by T. Standring, M.D.,B.S.,D.P.H.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,F.R.S.H. Medical Officer of Health PREFACE To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich. MR. MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have pleasure in submitting the 62nd Annual Report on the Health of the Borough of Woolwich. The Report is on the general lines indicated by the Minister of Health. Since 1957 there has been a steady increase in the total home population of the Borough, which is now 148,140, being 1,290 more than the previous year. This year vital statistics call for little comment, except to mention the rise in the birth rate to 15.1, the total of 2,248 births being the largest number in the Borough for eleven years. The principal causes of death were again cancer, coronary disease, pneumonia, and bronchitis. With regard to infectious disease, the one confirmed case of smallpox occurring during January, 1962 resulted in an immediate public demand for information and vaccination, and required an all out effort by all concerned to check contacts of the case. Fortunately, there was no further spread of infection, which reflects credit on all concerned. The year 1962 was a time in which a rapid expansion occurred in the Council's activities in Old People's Welfare and Home Safety, whilst excellent progress was also made in Slum Clearance and the establishment of further Smoke Control Areas. For some time the Council have been concerned at the plight of those aged persons who, through illness, senility, or other handicap, have become isolated from their fellows and who are often lonely and homebound. During 1962 the Council set up a new Old People's Welfare Committee, assisted by two Sub-Committees mainly comprising representatives of voluntary organisations, to be responsible for this important work, and in co-operation with the many voluntary and statutory workers renewed efforts are being made to brighten -2- the lives of the old folks and bring help wherever it is found to be needed. I am pleased to report that much progress has been made in building up a comprehensive old people's welfare service in the Borough. The Council's visiting scheme has been rapidly expanded in an effort to find all those old folks who are likely to require health or welfare assistance. During the past few months many hundreds of old people have been contacted for the first time. The type of help required is very diverse, but with the co-operation of many voluntary workers it is the aim of the Council to see that no genuine need is neglected. Also during 1962 the Council decided to expand its Home Safety activities, and established a local Home Safety Committee charged with the responsibility of carrying out local propaganda to inform the public of the extent and gravity of the home accident problem, and to investigate the causes of local home accidents and possible remedies. Representatives of organisations having a special interest and experience in home safety are among the members of the new Committee. The Committee's current programme of activities includes film programmes and talks to local organisations, exhibitions and the use of display units in local stores and at local functions, together with other forms of publicity, and instruction courses in home safety to youth and other organisations. The Government's plans for the re-organisation of London Local Government are now well-known and will, when implemented, have far-reaching effects, particularly in local authority health services, and therefore on the lives of Londoners for many years to come. The opportunity of planning and expanding these services to meet the growing demand for the various services in the new combined area of Woolwich and Greenwich will present a new challenge and one which will call for even higher standards of service. In conclusion, I am pleased to take this opportunity of acknowledging the help and co-operation received from Members of the Council, from colleagues, and from the many voluntary workers now assisting the Council. I should also like to thank the staff of my Department for their valued support during a particularly busy year. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T.

Ten pedestrians lost their lives whilst crossing the road; seven of these were over 60, the remainder being a middle-aged woman, a schoolboy, and a young girl. The vehicles involved consisted of private motor cars on seven occasions, an omnibus, a heavy goods vehicle, and a tipper lorry. On two occasions the passenger of a car received fatal injuries; in one case a man under 35 was in a collision with a sandbin, and in the other an elderly woman was in a collision with a lamp-post. Accidents between private motor cars and other vehicles resulted in the deaths of eight persons. In four cases the driver of the car died, and in one of these the young passenger died also. On two oocasions the car struck a motor scooter causing the death of the rider, and in one of these a young girl also received fatal injuries. The remaining three deaths all occurred to youths under twenty. A cyclist collided with a heavy goods vehicle; a power assisted cyclist collided with a light goods vehicle; and in the third case the rider of a motor cycle lost control of his machine and was thrown off. OTHER ACCIDENTS Accidents occurring in the home, at work, and in other places showed a substantial increase over 1961, the total of 34 deaths being 16 more than in that year. Six deaths occurred at work, twice the number in 1961. The objects and apparatus involved included falling steel cabinets and sacks of flour, ignition of chemicals, and electrocution from an electric drill. Among the six deaths occurring from miscellaneous accidents, there were instances of falling in the street, one person being blown over by the wind. Five of the deaths occurred to persons of over 70 years of age. The sixth, a middle-aged man, was struck by a train when crossing the line. -14- PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTION OF THE AREA During 1962 the Public Health Inspectors carried out 29,597 inspections, Including reinspections. The nature of these inspections is shown in Table No. 9. As a result, 570 Intimation Notices and 255 Statutory Notices were served. It was not found necessary to institute legal proceedings to enforce the requirements of Statutory Notices served under the Public Health (London) Act. COMPLAINTS The number of complaints received during the year was 2,458 compared with 3,040 in 1961. Any necessary action was taken where complaints were made or nuisances discovered.

Water for domestic use is supplied to these dwellings exclusively by the Metropolitan Water Board. Bacteriological and chemical tests, including those for radioactivity, are carried out by the Board, and results regularly forwarded to the Council. The water supply in this area is not subject to plumbo-solvent action. No complaints were received during the year as to the quantity of water, but two complaints were received as to quality. The complainants, who were neighbours living in new houses, alleged that the water supply was causing abnormal furring and corrosion of aluminium pans and kettles. Samples of water were subsequently taken from both premises by Officers from the Metropolitan Water Board and the Health Department, for analysis. -16- The Metropolitan Water Board's Director of Water Examination reported that the analysis of the samples from both houses showed the water to be of good bacteriological and physical quality, clean, bright in appearance and of the highest hygienic quality. Traces of copper, however, were found in water taken from the mains water supply, and considerably more copper was found in the water drawn from the hot water supply tap. Whilst the amount of copper present is not injurious to health, on rare occasions there is an adverse effect on aluminium ware, for a comparatively short period. The two houses concerned are equipped throughout in copper piping. The Board's Director advised that kettles and pans should be filled from the cold water supply tap in order to minimise corrosion; alternatively, the use of good enamel cooking utensils was recommended in place of aluminium in premises newly fitted with copper supply piping. The Council's Public Analyst to whom samples were also submitted for testing, reported the presence of 0.5 parts per million of copper in one sample of water, and 0.3 parts per million in the other sample. Although not rendering the water injurious to health, the presence of copper can affect its taste and in his view there was little doubt that the effect on the aluminium pans was due to the presence of copper in conjunction with the hardness of the water. The Public Analyst recommended running the water for a period as a practical measure to reduce the effect on aluminium ware. The complainants were advised of these facts and no further complaints were received. There are seven wells in use in the Borough, and samples of well water taken for bacteriological examination showed the water to be satisfactory. Well water is used at the Council's swimming baths at Plumstead and Woolwich, and for fire fighting and industrial purposes. DRAINAGE The Public Health Inspectors supervised the necessary work of repair or reconstruction of the 319 drainage defects which were found during the year. Twenty-seven smoke tests were applied on private or combined drains suspected of being defective. Of the 27 tests made, 15 drains were found to be defective. In one instance the drain was found to be no longer in use and was exposed by the staff of the Department and permanently sealed off. Twenty-four combined drains were tested and where necessary the work of repair was carried out by the responsible owners. -17- PUBLIC BATHS AND PADDLING POOLS Routine sampling of water from the Council's swimming baths, boating and paddling pools, and testing for pH. reaction and ohlorine content was carried out by the Health Department. Samples of water were also submitted to the Southern Group Laboratory, Hither Green, for bacteriological examination. Average results of the tests and examinations are shown belows- Probable No. of Bacillus Coli per 100 m.l. Average pH. Value Average free Chlorine p.p.m. Average Temperature. Plate Count.

A further 70 persons who live outside the Borough are employed by local industries on outwork. To ensure that a satisfactory standard of cleanliness is maintained in the houses of the outworkers and that the working conditions are satisfactory, regular inspections are made by the Public Health Inspector. The nature of the work is as follows:- -18- Nature of Work No. of Outworkers in August list required by Sec. 110(1)(c). No. of cases of default in sending lists to Council.

In all cases the Notices were complied with. WOODWORM AND OTHER PESTS The Public Health Inspectors made 238 inspections as a result of requests from residents for advice and assistance in ridding premises of insect pests, and where requested to do so staff of the Department undertook the necessary disinfestation. Altogether 31 premises were disinfested of woodworm; 7 of cockroaches; one of emits; and one of wild bees. Twenty-four wasps nests were also destroyed. -20- Charges made to the responsible persons for the work outlined above totalled £166. 8. 11. FOXES Foxes were reported to have been seen on two premises owned by the Council, and on investigation some fox-holes were discovered. Disinfestation was carried out by the Rodent Control staff. RAG FLOCK There are three premises in the Borough registered under the provisions of the Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951, and one factory licensed under the Act for the manufacture of rag flock. During the year four samples of rag flock were obtained for analysis. All the samples passed the prescribed standards of cleanliness. CINEMAS A good standard of cleanliness was found to be maintained in the sanitary conveniences of the cinemas in the Borough. Inspections are carried out regularly by the Public Health Inspectors. SHOPS ACT INSPECTIONS The Borough Council is responsible for that part of the Shops Act dealing with temperature, ventilation, sanitary accommodation, lighting, washing facilities, and facilities for employees to take meals. In this connection the Public Health Inspectors made 450 inspections during the year and served 22 Notices, as a result of which 113 defects were remedied. -21- PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT, 1933 Other than registered Pharmacists, the registration of sellers of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is carried out by the Council. At the end of the year the number of persons entered on the Council's list of persons entitled to sell Part II poisons was 131. NOISE ABATEMENT Noise continues to give some residents cause for complaint, and the Public Health Inspectors made 50 inspections connected with noise complaints during the year under review. Chimes from ice-cream vendors' vans gave rise to a number of complaints during the summer, and all such complaints were investigated. Letters were written to all principal manufacturers who retail ice-cream by direct sales, as well as local manufacturers, pointing out the requirements in respect of musical chimes contained in the Noise Abatement Act. All complaints of chimes did not refer to their pealing outside permitted periods. One night-worker complained that his sleep was disturbed regularly by an ice-cream vendor who visited daily at the same time the road in which he lived. The driver of the van concerned was subsequently interviewed by the Public Health Inspector and was persuaded to visit the road later in the day. Various other noise complaints ranging from crowing cockerels to noisy jive clubs, were dealt with by informal action. An all-night garage was the subject of a complaint from neighbours, who alleged that hammering could be heard going on throughout the night. Following a visit by the Public Health Inspector to the garage concerned the nuisance abated. A resident complained that a nearby factory engaged on a washing process, blew off excess steam from a boiler at 2 a.m. The Public Health Inspector visited the factory and drew the Manager's attention to this complaint. On investigation it was discovered that the regular stoker was away and the temporary stoker was unaware that he was causing a nuisance. Following the intervention of the Public Health Inspector the practice of blowing off excess steam in the early hours of the morning was discontinued. -22- In dealing with complaints of noise nuisance throughout the year it was not found necessary in any instance to take statutory action to secure abatement. RODENT CONTROL During the year 8l8 complaints of rats, and 371 of mice, were received, and in addition to the investigation of these complaints the systematic inspection under the "block control" system was continued. A total of 10,043 premises were inspected, and of these 8,581 were under "block control". Thirty "block control" schemes were carried out during the year. The number of properties found to be infested by rats or mice was 1,557, which included 140 business or industrial premises. Treatment is carried out by the Council free of charge at all private dwellings; for industrial and business premises a charge is made. Where defects of a structural nature are found to be causing or aggravating an infestation the remedy is pursued with the owner of the property. A total of 22 drains suspected of being defective were smoke tested by the staff of the Department, and in 12 cases the tests showed the drains to be defective. Following informal action by the Department, the defects so discovered were subsequently remedied by the responsible owners, and it was not found necessary to serve any formal Notices during the year under the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. With the co-operation of the Borough Engineer's Department, a new system of sewer treatments was instigated; this involves the use of the poison Sodium Fluroacetamide,which is deposited in the sewers four times a year. On the treatments carried out this year the results so far indicate that there is likely to be a considerable reduction in the number of 'takes' compared with previous treatments. HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS SHOPS The Council have made Byelaws to secure the cleanliness of hairdressers and barbers' shops and the equipment used therein. In addition, all persons carrying on the business of hairdresser or -23- barber, and their premises, are required to be registered with the Council under Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. By the end of the year the total number of premises registered under the Act by the Council was as follows:- 6l ladies' Hairdressers; 4l Gentlemen's Hairdressers; 8 Combined Ladies' and Gentlemen's Hairdressers. Regular inspections of all the premises are carried out by the Public Health Inspectors. BETTING AND GAMING ACT, 1960 In accordance with the provisions of the Betting and Gaming Act, 1960 the Council issue permits in respect of amusements with prizes. Applications received from proprietors of cafes, restaurants, and public houses for permits under this Act are referred to the Health Department for reports as to the general suitability of their premises. During the course of the year under review, 8 inspections were made and reports submitted to the Town Clerk. LICENSING ACT, 1961 - APPLICATIONS FOR CLUB REGISTRATION Applications for Club registrations under the provisions of the above-mentioned Act are considered by the local Magistrate's Court, but copies of the applications are also sent to the Council to enable them to submit any observations to the Clerk of the Court before the applications are considered by the Magistrate. The copy applications are passed to the Health Department by the Town Clerk for a report to ensure that the Council's minimum requirements as the Public Health and Food & Drugs Authority are met at Club premises. Forty-four Club premises were inspected and reported upon during the year. -24- LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1959 - CARAVANS A few weeks before Christmas a vacant site in the Borough was found to be occupied by seven caravans and one tent. The caravan dwellers were interviewed and admitted that they moved on to the site without seeking permission from the owner of the land. Section 22 of the above-mentioned Act provides that no person shall use or knowingly allow to be used as a site for movable dwellings any land unless he holds a licence granted by the Borough Council. Licences had not been applied for nor issued in this case, and accordingly Notices were served under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959 on the caravan dwellers and also on the owner of the — land. On receipt of the Notice the owner of the site visited the caravan dwellers and they promised to leave. This, in fact, they did, but in only a week they returned. Further Notices were delivered to the site by hand, and the caravan dwellers were told by the Chief Public Health Inspector that unless they left the site within three days arrangements would be made to tow the caravans onto the road, where the matter would be dealt with by the Police. The warning, however, was ignored and, together with a vehicle equipped with towing gear loaned by the Borough Engineer's Department, the Public Health Inspector visited the site accompanied by Police Officers. It proved unnecessary, however, to use the vehicle. The occupiers of the caravans asked to be allowed to pack their equipment and leave. This was agreed to, and they left. The local Police gave the utmost help in the matter and their co-operation was greatly appreciated. STREET CLEANSING There are over l6l miles of roads to be cleansed in the Borough, of which 11 per cent. are swept at least once daily; 8 per cent. three to six times weekly; and 8l per cent. twice weekly. Fifty-four street sweepers are employed on the work and, in addition, a mechanical sweeper and sprinkler is used to sweep the main traffic routes in the Borough and the roads in the shopping areas of -25- Powis Street, Plumstead High Street and Eltham High Street. Approximately 9,650 street gullies are cleansed periodically by mechanical gully cleansing machines. HOUSE AND TRADE REFUSE During the year under review 38,120 tons of refuse were collected by the Council's vehicles and 39,230 tons disposed of at the Council's Refuse Destructor or carted to tip. The difference between the two weights is largely the quantity of refuse delivered to the Refuse Destructor from the Royal Arsenal and from trade premises. Some 1,443 tons of scrap metal, 741 tons of waste paper, and 103 tons of textiles were salvaged and sold during the year, producing an income of £9,870. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are twenty conveniences for men and a similar number for women, within the Borough, and in all conveniences the water closets are available without charge. Free Washing Facilities - For the past 11 years the Council has provided free washing facilities at the main public conveniences, including the provision of paper towels, and this service continues to be used to an increasing extent and is much appreciated by the public. Paid washing facilities, which include the supply of a linen towel, are also available. The above information on Street Cleansing, House and Trade Refuse, and Public Conveniences, has been kindly supplied by the Borough Engineer. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The Council has four bathing establishments in the Borough. This service includes Swimming Baths, Slipper Baths, Turkish Baths, Public Laundry, and in winter the Eltham Baths large swimming pool is converted for Public Hall use for social and sporting activities, and the Woolwich large pool for Indoor Bowling. The attendance figures for the Public Laundry during the past six years are as follows: 1961/62 - 26,124; 1960/61 - 24,211; 1959/60 - 23,570; 1958/59 - 26,081; 1957/58 - 23,939; and 1956/57 - 18,295. -26- Attendances for Slipper Baths in 1961/62 totalled 105,323 and the total attendances for all services for the year was 734,031, a decrease of 10,730 over the year 1960/61. Altogether 183,459 schoolchildren attended at the Baths in organised classes for swimming and swimming instruction, and 4,748 swimming lessons were provided for members of the public. The detailed attendances for the year ended 31st March, 1962 were as followss:- Public Swimming 338,849 Swimming Tuition 4,748 School Swimming 183,459 Slipper Baths 105,323 Turkish Baths 9,963 Public Laundry - Hand Washing 8,436 Machine Washing 17,688 Swimming Club 37,366 Schoolchildren - Cricket School Free Baths to Old Age Pensioners 1,505 and Unemployed Persons 7,229 Spectators 14,592 Bowling Green (excluding Club reservations). 4.873 754,031 ELTHAM CREMATORIUM The Crematorium situated in the grounds adjoining Eltham Cemetery, is administered by the Woolwich, Greenwich, and Northwest Kent Joint Crematorium Committee, which comprises the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, Bexley, Dartford, Erith, and Gravesend, and the Urban Districts of Chislehurst and Sidcup, and Crayford. The Crematorium was opened in August, 1956. The number of cremations taking place at this Crematorium during 1962 totalled 2,762 being 97 more than the previous year. BURIALS AND CREMATIONS During the year arrangements were made by the Department for the burial of two persons who had died in the Borough, where -27- no other suitable arrangements were being made for their burial. Both these persons were elderly. The Council's expenses amounted to £24, of which £13 was recovered from the Estates of the deceased persons. OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE NEW WORK OF THE BOROUGH COUNCIL New powers became available to the Borough Council during the year under the National Assistance Act, 1948 (Amendment) Act, 1962 for providing, either directly, or assisting voluntary-bodies to provide, meals and recreation for old people. Having regard to the importance of this new work, the Council decided that an Old People's Welfare Committee should be constituted as a Standing Committee of the Council, and that the whole of the Council's functions and duties in reference to old people's welfare should be delegated to it. The transfer to the Council of old people's welfare work previously carried out by the Council of Social Service also took place on the 1st October. In framing the Terms of Reference of the new Committee particular stress has been laid on the work which the new Committee will do, not only direct but also on the work which it will carry out alongside and in close partnership with the various voluntary organisations active in this work, the need for whose help is greater than ever before. The Old People's Welfare Committee comprises 12 Members of the Council, and is responsible for the organisation of the visiting service for old people, including friendly visiting by voluntary workers; work centres and employment schemes, holiday schemes, facilities for meals at lunch clubs and by a mobile meals service; the incontinent laundry service; provision for the after-care and welfare of old persons discharged from hospital; the distribution of funds and other gifts received from national and local appeals; the compilation of a central register of the names and addresses of all elderly, invalid or handicapped persons resident within the Borough, and the inter-change of information with persons and local organisations concerned with old people's welfare work; the establishment of a central enquiry office for the use of elderly persons, and the publishing of facilities and assistance available within the Borough to elderly people. -28- Two Sub-Committees have been appointed, consisting of representatives of interested voluntary organisations - (l) a Meals Service Sub-Committee, which is responsible to the main Committee for carrying out the administration of the meals service for old people, and for providing regular consultation with the voluntary bodies organising the meals service; and (2) an Old People's Welfare Co-ordinating Sub-Committee set up to maintain regular contact with voluntary bodies working for the elderly in the Borough. This SubCommittee comprises representatives of 20 local organisations active in old people's welfare work. An early meeting took place with representatives of local voluntary organisations to consider how the voluntary work might be expanded and developed sufficiently to meet the growing needs of the elderly in all parts of the Borough. I am pleased to report that those voluntary organisations who previously assisted with the meals, holiday, friendly visiting, and other schemes, have continued to work in close co-operation with the Borough Council to the great benefit of the old people of the Borough. It has also been possible to enlist the aid of several other voluntary helpers. Visiting of Old People - Owing to the large increase in the number of elderly persons requiring help, the Council's Old People's visiting staff was increased at the end of the year to four Nurse Visitors and one Welfare Assistant; consequently, many more visits than ever before are now being made. The Visitors are also endeavouring to find other elderly people who require health or welfare assistance but who do not seek assistance of their own accord. The Council's Visitors are responsible for arranging as required appropriate health and welfare assistance in conjunction with the family doctor and many other workers. In this work attention has been concentrated on those elderly people who cannot get out of doors, and who without the mobile meals, home nursing, home help and other domiciliary services would require admission to a hospital or to a County Council or other Home. Nevertheless, there will still be a great need in many instances for a friendly visitor who would have time to spend an hour or more weekly with the old person. During the year 7,797 home visits were carried out by the Council's Old People's Visitors. The greatly increased visiting of old people in the Borough by the Council's staff has been widely welcomed, particularly by the hundreds of old people visited for the first time. -29- Central Register - In conjunction with this visiting work the important task of compiling a comprehensive central register of elderly persons requiring assistance is now well advanced, and at the end of the year the register contained 3,433 names. Of this total 800 were homebound, 52 also being bedridden. The progress made in the preparation of this register has been possible through the ready co-operation of medical practitioners, the Borough Council's Housing Department staff, the County Council officers, the district nurses, the National Assistance Board officers, the W.V.S., the Home Help organisers, the Woolwich Council of Social Service, and many others who responded to the appeal for information. These workers and helpers were asked to notify the Health Department of the names and addresses of any old person thought to be genuinely needy and requiring help from one or other of the various services available, particularly the homebound, the lonely, and those in straightened circumstances, so that an early visit could be made and they could be put in touch with those who might be able to help. Supplies of pre-paid postcards were delivered to all these workers, and when such a card is received by the Department the old person is visited at the first opportunity. A general enquiry office for old people's welfare has been established in the Department. MOBILE MEALS The Women's Voluntary Service, who have been active in delivering mobile meals in the Borough for some years, work in close collaboration with the Borough Council in the running of this service, the three meals vans being manned by W.V.S. drivers and helpers. At the end of the year the Old People's Welfare Committee decided that in view of the increased waiting list for the mobile meals service a new route should be started immediately In the Woolwich and Plumstead area. Each old person receives a meal three times a week, the meals being supplied by two private caterers and by the Council's Catering Department. -30- LUNCHEON CLUBS The responsibility for running the Plumstead and Progress Hall (Eltham), Old People's Luncheon Clubs, which was formerly with the Council of Social Service, is now with the Health Department. Luncheon Club facilities are also provided at the Victorians Old People's Club in Sherard Road, Eltham, the meals at this Club being cooked on the premises. At the end of the year the Council were considering the possibility of establishing additional luncheon clubs in the Abbey Wood and Middle Park areas of the Borough. A specially fitted London County Council coach conveys handicapped persons to the Eltham Luncheon Club on two days a week. TRANSPORT OF HANDICAPPED AND LESS ACTIVE EIDERLY PEOPLE At the end of the year the Council decided to purchase a 15-cwt. Bedford Dormobile vehicle fitted with a Utilabus conversion. The vehicle has a low loading line with sufficient headroom and fixed handrails for aged persons to enter the vehicle conveniently. It can carry two wheelchair passengers and four other passengers, or alternatively six passengers. The seats can also be removed for the transport of goods. It is fitted with a ramp for the reception of wheelchairs. It will be used for the transport of handicapped, homebound, and less active old people to luncheon and other clubs, to treatment centres, on local outings, and to local concerts. HOLIDAY SCHEME 160 old folks enjoyed a holiday at Westgate during 1962. They travelled in four parties; two parties going in May and two in September. Accommodation was reserved at the same two Guest Houses as in previous years. Each party was accompanied by a voluntary helper, who arranged outings for the Woolwich party during their stay at the resort. This was much appreciated by the parties. The old people made a contribution of 35/- each towards the cost of the holiday, which included the coach fare. The scheme is available only to those elderly people who have not recently had a holiday and who would not otherwise have been able to have a holiday. -31- FRIENDLY VISITING SCHEME Responsibility for the organisation of the friendly visiting scheme, together with the recruitment of voluntary visitors, is now with the new Old People's Welfare Co-ordinating Sub-Committee, and is organised by a member of the staff of the Health Department. Most of the voluntary visitors who previously worked with the Council of Social Service are continuing in this work, and new voluntary visitors are also coming forward to help. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY SERVICE This service is provided by the Council under powers contained in the Public Health (London) Act, and the work is carried out by the Health Department Disinfecting staff. Only applicants who cannot make other suitable arrangements for the laundering of their soiled linen are considered. Altogether 30,947 articles were laundered during the year, as follows Night Attire 5,028; Sheets 5,554; Draw Sheets 4,786; Blankets 107; Pillow Cases 3,045; Towels 2,879; Miscellaneous 9,548. FESTIVAL OF CHRISTMAS The Worshipful the Mayor, Councillor Mrs. M.E. Polley, J.P., constituted a Festival of Christmas Committee with a view to coordinating and encouraging the various voluntary bodies in the Borough to make extra efforts to raise money for her Appeal Fund for gifts and food parcels for old people at Christmas. The Committee decided to stage a number of seasonal functions with a view not only to raising money but also to engendering a real Festival of Christmas spirit in the Borough. In launching the Appeal the Mayor stated that as many old people are particularly lonely at Christmas she was endeavouring to raise funds so that gifts could be distributed amongst a much greater number of old people and so do something to show them that someone still cares. The Festival was inaugurated by the switching on of the first Christmas illuminations in London, and the Mayoral Party travelled -32- through the town in a Stage Coach. During the Festival week prominent buildings in the Borough were floodlit} two Gift Shops were manned by voluntary helpers; street collections and collections at local public houses were made during the week; carol services were held; and several voluntary organisations arranged functions to raise money for the Appeal. A large number of local organisations took part in the Festival, not the least contribution being made by local schoolchildren. A total of over £2,250 was raised directly by the Mayor's Appeal, and gifts were sent to over 2,000 old people in the Borough, voluntary helpers making the distribution. In addition, several factory and Church groups, schools, and voluntary organisations sent their own gifts, and requested the names of suitable recipients; a further 1,000 names were submitted to these groups, so that in all, over 3,000 needy and deserving old people in the Borough were able to receive a Christmas gift. The Mayor was extremely gratified to receive scores of letters of thanks from those who benefited from her most successful Appeal. BULB GROWING COMPETITION This annual competition for homebound elderly persons is a piece of work transferred from the Woolwich Council of Social Service. 50 old folk entered the competition this year, each receiving a daffodil bulb, pot and fibre. A W.V.S. voluntary worker again acted as Judge. HOUSING REPAIRS The number of occupied dwellinghouses in the Borough at the end of the year was estimated to be 45,460, being 516 more than the previous year. Premises inspected for defects during the year under the Public Health (London) Act, and the Housing Act, totalled 2,195. Of total number inspected, 8l4 houses were found to be not in all respects reasonably fit for habitation. A total of 599 houses were rendered fit by Informal action, which included the service of 570 Intimation Notices. -33- In 255 instances it was necessary to serve Statutory Notices to ensure that the necessary work was carried out. OVERCROWDING Following requests from housing applicants or from the Housing Department, 84 inspections were made during the year in connection with housing conditions. Ten families were found to occupy accommodation that was statutorily overcrowded, and details of these families were reported to the Housing Department. It is the responsibility of the Council to supply in writing a statement showing the permitted number in respect of any dwelling, and in this respect 442 premises were visited and measured following requests from either landlords or tenants. SLUM CLEARANCE AREAS Further progress was made by the Council during 1962 in its Slum Clearance work, particularly in the St. Mary's and Glyndon Redevelopment Areas. The following Borough Council Clearance Areas were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year:- Date confirmed by Minister Kingsman Street (No.l) Area 219-223(odd) Kingsman Street. l4th August, 1962 Kingsman Street (No.2) Area 205-215(odd) Kingsman Street. 7th August, 1962 Kingsman Street (No.3) Area 127 and 129 Kingsman Street. 8th October, 1962 St. Mary's Street Area 12-24(even) St. Mary's Street. 26th September, 1962 Bowling Green Row (No.l) Area 1-10(cons.)

These eight Areas, which comprise 47 dwellings, with occupants totalling 117 in 50 families, completed the Council's five-year Slum Clearance programme ended December, 1960. During 1962 I represented that the undermentioned properties in the Glyndon Redevelopment Area are unfit for human habitation and should be considered for slum clearance by the Council. Earl Rise Nos. l-49(odd); 12-22(even); 34-60(even). Walmer Terrace Nos. 4l-54(cons.); 56-66(cons.). Elmley Street Nos. 6-56(even). Glyndon Road Nos. 9-4l(odd). These houses are about 100 years old; most of them have dampness, together with bulged and fractured walls, leaking roofs, and considerable disrepair. There are 127 families living in these houses, comprising 282 adults and 44 children. INDIVIDUAL UNFIT HOUSES The following houses were represented by me during the year as unfit for human habitation, and Closing Orders were made by the Council as follows:- Closing Orders - 2 Eglinton Road 4 „ 8 „ 10 „ 29 Waverley Road 43 Woodhill. 32 Woolwich High Street (Part) 16 Brookhill Road (Basement front and back rooms -35- Closing Orders - 53 Footscray Road (Lower ground floor rooms) 28 Woolwich Common (Basement front and back rooms). On the satisfactory completion of work to make the accommodation fit, the Council determined Closing Orders in respect of:- 1 Marmadon Road, 278 Albert Road, 6l Brookhill Road, 75 Hudson Road, 84 Plumstead Common Road (Part), and 183 Plumstead High Street (Basement rooms). IMPROVEMENT GRANTS Applications from owners, owner/occupiers or leaseholders for Improvement Grants are in the first place submitted to the Borough Treasurer, who refers them to the Health Department for an inspection of the premises to ascertain that the proposed works satisfy the requirements of the standards specified in the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959. This Act provides for two types of grant. The 'Standard' grant can be obtained as a right by the landlord of dwellings built prior to 1945. The grant, up to a maximum of £155 can provide for half the cost of the work involved for installing five basic amenities - (1) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (2) a wash-hand basin; (3) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (4) a hot water supply; and (5) facilities for storing food. The 'Discretionary' grant enables the Council to contribute up to half the estimated cost of improvements which would enable a dwelling to conform to a 12-point standard. This form of grant, which is paid at the Council's discretion, has a minimum of £50 and a maximum of £400. During 1962 the Public Health Inspectors carried out 171 inspections in respect of applications for 'Discretionary' grants, 75 inspections in respect of applications for 'Standard' grants, and 77 visits were made to advise owners or builders regarding Improvement Grants.

During the course of the year the final 74 dwellings of the 279 in the scheme were occupied, the four 14-storey tower blocks dominating the area. Prom the upper floors there is an excellent view for miles around. Early in the year, work commenced on a further 35 dwellings and a doctor's surgery at the Junction of Woolwich Church Street and Frances Street. The St. Mary's Comprehensive Development Area can now be said to be entering the final stages, as at the end of the year nearly 850 dwellings had been completed out of the proposed 1,212. In the second of the Council's Redevelopment Areas at Glyndon, there is now tangible evidence of the work which has been taking place over the last few years. The first dwellings were officially opened in November by The Worshipful the Mayor, and by the end of December, 40 families had taken up occupation. The first stage of development comprises 252 dwellings, including three 11-storey blocks of flats, where space heating is by gas warm air. Laundry and garage facilities are provided and there will be a shopping parade. In the meantime, rehousings have continued from the second stage where plans have been approved for the erection of 179 dwellings. The Council is also awaiting confirmation by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government of the third stage of the Development Area. Plans have been approved for the erection of 119 dwellings in the Kirkham Street Area, and already 68 families have been rehoused in order that the sites may be cleared. Further, the majority of the properties have been acquired and it is anticipated that the whole site will shortly be available for redevelopment. Building work has also continued on several other sites in the Borough, particularly at Southend Crescent and Eltham Road. The Council have also rehoused 81 families from Temporary Dwellings in order to make further sites available for permanent development. At the 3lst December, 1962 there were 10|094 tenancies in properties owned or controlled by the Council, and at that date there were 2,978 applicants on the Housing Register, compared with 2,772 the previous year. The above information on the housing progress in the Borough has been kindly supplied by the Chief Housing Officer. -38- INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD PREMISES WHERE FOOD IS PREPARED OR OFFERED FOR SAlE A total of 1,730 inspections of food premises, other than the daily market inspections, was carried out by the Food Inspectors during the year. Inspections of registered food premises were as followss:- Markets - Daily; Dairy visits 5; Distributors of Milk 352; Ice-cream Premises 431; Premises where Meat is Potted, Pickled, Pressed and Preserved 127; Premises where Sausages are Manufactured 100; Premises where Fish is Cured or prepared for Frying 31; Wholesale dealer in Margarine 2; Restaurants, Cafes and Snack Bars 244; Industrial and School Meals Service Canteens 67; Bakehouses 21; Itinerant Vendors 4; Non-Registered Premises 166; Greengrocery and Fish Shops 89; Public Houses 91. FOOD SAMPLING, 1962 During the year ended 31st December, 1962, 760 samples of food and drugs (being 581 informal and 179 formal samples) were submitted for analysis by the Public Analyst. Of these, 18 informal samples were reported to be adulterated or otherwise not complying with the statutory requirements, giving a percentage of 2.5 compared with 3.2 in 1961. No private samples were examined during the year. Adverse reports were received on the following samples:- TABIE NO. 12 Sample No. Article Formal or Informal (F or I) Adulteration or Irregularity. 5 Marmalade 1 Contained a black deposit of soot. 63 Rose Hip Syrup 1 Contained sulphur dioxide 230 parts per million, not disclosed on label. -39- 95 Cochineal Extract 1 1ncorrectly labelled. 100 Table Creams 1 Contained sulphur dioxide 60 parts per million, not disclosed on label. 177 Beef Sausage Meat 1 Contained sulphur dioxide, the presence of this preservative not being declared. 179 Salt Pork 1 Contained excessive Zinc. 195 Canned Rhubarb in Syrup. 1 Contained excessive tin, the can being badly corroded. 352 Pure Lard 1 Contained a permitted antioxidant not disclosed on the label. 384 Caster Sugar 1 Contained 4% salt. 432 Corn Muffin Mix 1 Contained a permitted antioxidant not disclosed on the label. 457 Parmesan Cheese 1 Contained fat 27.6% not 32% as claimed on the label. 473 Gravy Browning 1 Contained an abnormal amount of iron (.11%). 645 Whisky 1 68.3° Proof.

The samples of food reported as genuine included the following samples:- Milk 165; Meat Products 42; Ice-cream 22; Sugar Confectionery 17; Sauces 14; and Soup Preparations 10. MILK SUPPLY At the end of the year there were 159 registered Distributors of Milk in the Borough. Regular inspections were carried out by the Public Health Inspectors of the Milk Distributors' premises, and a good standard of cleanliness was maintained. There is one Dealer's Steriliser's licence and one Dealer's Pasteuriser's licence in force in respect of the Dairy in the Borough; 85 Dealers' pre-packed licences for the combined use of the special designations "Pasteurised", "Sterilised" and "Tuberculin Tested" milk; 3 Dealers' pre-packed licences for the combined use of the special designations "Pasteurised" and "Sterilised", and 71 Dealers' pre-packed licences for the use of the special designation "Sterilised" milk. Included in the above total are licences issued in respect of 7 Milk Vending Machines now installed in the Borough. All the licences referred to above are issued under the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The percentage of fat content of milk samples submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis during the year was as follows:- No. of Samples 4.5 per cent. and over 7 4 per cent. and under 4.5 per cent. 8 3.5 per cent. and under 4 per cent. 90 3 per cent. and under 3.5 per cent. 60 Below 3 per cent. Nil 165 -41- Of the fifteen samples containing 4 per cent. of fat and over, 11 were of Channel Islands milk, one of Tuberculin Tested milk and 3 of ordinary milk. No Channel Islands samples contained less than the legal requirement, 4 per cent. of fat. In order to assess the keeping quality of the milk, 198 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were taken to the Park Hospital Laboratory, Hither Green, for the Methylene Blue test. All the samples submitted passed the test. 196 samples of Pasteurised or Tuberculin Tested Pasteurised milk were also submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for the Phosphatase test which determines the adequacy of pasteurisation. All the samples tested were passed as satisfactory. Satisfactory reports were also received from the Park Hospital Laboratory in respect of 23 samples of Sterilised milk or Tuberculin Tested Sterilised milk subjected to the Turbidity test. The tests referred to above are contained in the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The taking of samples of milk during the course of delivery to schools, hospitals, and institutions in the early morning was continued. Twelve samples taken in this manner were submitted for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and eleven samples were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for the Methylene Blue and Phosphatase tests. ICE-CREAM The number of premises in the Borough registered by the Council for the sale of ice-cream totalled 317 at the end of the year. Except for four premises which are registered for manufacture and storage, pre-packed ice-cream only is sold. Inspections of premises where ice-cream is sold, stored or manufactured are made regularly, and all applicants for registration of premises for the sale of Ice-cream are first visited and advised of the statutory requirements contained in the Heat Treatment Regulations, in addition to the usual inspection of the premises. During the course of the year 17 samples were submitted to the Park Hospital Laboratory for grading by the Methylene Blue test, and all the samples passed the grading test. -42- PUBLIC HOUSES Of the 135 licensed premises in the Borough, 24 serve main meals. The supervision of hygienic conditions in public houses is carried out by the Public Health Inspectors, and in this connection periodic routine visits are made. In 1962 three informal Notices were served on the Brewers concerned to secure the remedying of the defects found. COMPLAINTS OF UNSOUND FOOD During the year 62 complaints of unsound food were made to the Department, and all the complaints were investigated by the Food Inspectors. A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers of a bottle of mineral water found to contain a nail and a match. A warning letter was also sent to a bakery which had sold a bread roll containing a piece of wire. Among other complaints of unsound food investigated by the Food Inspectors, were mould in sausages (4 cases); mould in cakes and pies (3 cases); dirty bread (8 cases); mouldy Jam; mould in a tin of beans; unsound meat (9 cases); maggots In biscuits (2 cases); a piece of rubber in a tin-of peaches found to be a small rubber gasket used at the cannery to make an air-tight seal on cans; a tin of peaches alleged to be the cause of food poisoning; hairs in a meat pie - these were, in fact, bristles from the animal from which the pie was manufactured; a foreign body in a bottle of milk, and a dirty bottle of milk the dirt was found to be on the outside and not the inside of the milk bottle; and ants in a Jar of marmalade. Where necessary the responsible manufacturers or retailers of the foodstuffs were either written to or were interviewed and their attention drawn to the complaints. The complainants were subsequently advised of the action taken. Where complaints of stale food are received the shop premises are visited, with the result that in many instances the remaining stock is withdrawn from sale. -45- UNSOUND POOD During the year more than 26,000 individual items of foodstuffs of all kinds weighing 52½ tons were condemned as unfit for human consumption. About 40 tons of this amount represents offal and carcase meat surrendered at the local slaughterhouse. Between May and July when beef from Uraguay was being imported, more than 700 quarters of this beef arrived at a cold store in the Borough. Large quantities of this meat were found on arrival to be mouldy, and subsequently when inspected it was found necessary to condemn more than two tons because of the severity of the mould. MEAT INSPECTION The decline of tuberculosis in cattle, calves, and pigs continues. It is significant that no whole carcases were condemned for this disease. However, 111 carcases of pigs, sheep, or calves were condemned because of their unsuitability for human food. Pneumonia in pigs, and parasitic infestations of various kinds were currently the most prevalent cause of condemnation. The overall picture was that animals being presented for slaughter were being received in much better condition than hitherto, and it was noticeable that there was much less bruising of carcases due to better handling during transit. The total number of animals slaughtered and inspected during the year at the Garland Road slaughterhouse was 63,409. Details are as follows:- -44- TABLE NO. 13 CARCASES & OFFAL INSPECTED AND CONDEMNED IN WHOLE OR IN PART, 1962 Cattle excluding Cows Cows Calves Sheep and Lambs Pigs Number killed and inspected. 10,773 60 7,142 11,865 33,569 All diseases (except Tuberculosis and Cysticerci) - Whole carcases condemned - - 29 5 77 Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 3,719 20 20 425 8,734 Percentage of the number inspected affected with disease other than Tuberculosis and Cysticerci 34.5 33.3 .68 3.6 26.2 Tuberculosis only - Whole carcases condemned - - - - - Carcases of which some part or organ was condemned 99 2 - - 333 Percentage of the number inspected affected with Tuberculosis .9 3.3 - - .2 Cysticercosis - Carcases of which some part or organ Was condemned and treated by refrigeration. 74 - - - - -45- CLEAN AIR SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Good progress was made in 1962 towards bringing the whole of the Borough under Smoke Control. Further Smoke Control Areas were declared, and at the end of 1962 there were 15 Areas in operation and a further four in various stages towards completion. The following Areas, details of which have been previously reported, are now in operation:- St. Mary's Middle Park (South West) St. Mary's No. 2. Clothworker's Wood. St. Mary's No. 3. Coldharbour Abbey Wood New Eltham Abbey Wood (Abbey Estate) Garrison North Abbey Wood No. 2. • Glyndon Abbey Wood No. 3. Horn Park. Middle Park (North East) The following four Areas were declared during the year:- St. Mary's No. 4 This Area is an extension of the existing St. Mary's Areas. It maintains the progress of smoke control in this part of the Borough concurrently with the Council's redevelopment scheme. The Area comprises eight acres and 191 properties. Virtually all the properties will be newly erected Borough Council dwellings, therefore no conversions will be necessary. Operative dates- 1st October, 1963. Glyndon No. 2 This Area incorporates the second phase of the Council's Redevelopment Scheme, together with adjacent London County Council redevelopment on the north side of the North Kent Railway line. It comprises 26 acres and will consist of approximately 180 newly erected Borough Council dwellings, 200 newly erected London County Council dwellings, and ten private dwellings. In the Borough Council and County Council dwellings no conversions will be necessary. Operative date:- 1st October, 1963. -46- Rockmount Area This Area adjoins the Abbey Wood No. 3 Smoke Control Area. It comprises that part of the London County Council Rockmount Road Redevelopment Scheme which is not already within the Abbey Wood No. 3 Area. It consists of some five acres and will contain 250 newly erected London County Council permanent dwellings. Operative date:- 1st October, 1963. Eltham Area This is a large Area of predominently private property. It comprises 1,550 acres and 5,325 dwellings. Of the total number of properties, 358 are Borough Council permanent dwellings, 763 are London County Council permanent dwellings, and the remainder are private dwellings. In the County Council dwellings and in the majority of the Borough Council dwellings, no works of conversion are necessary. Included in this Area are 423 shops, offices or other non-domestic buildings. Approximately 2,900 private dwellings require 4,320 solid fuel appliances, and a further 623 dwellings require gas ignition only. Operative date:- 1st October, 1964. NEW AREA During the year preliminary work commenced upon a further large area in Eltham, to be known as the Well Hall Smoke Control Area. It will comprise 540 acres, involving some 4,200 dwellings, virtually all of which are privately owned. It is estimated that some 3,000 dwellings will require works of conversion. It is anticipated that the operative date will be 1st October,, 1964. GENERAL At the end of the year there were 2,854 acres and 19,473 dwellings within operative Smoke Control Areas, and a further 1,589 acres and 6,159 dwellings within Areas being brought into operation. Details of the acreage and number of properties in these Areas are set out in Table No. 14 and the accompanying map. PROCEDURE As referred to in my previous Annual Report, the Minister of Housing and Local Government has adopted a simpler administrative procedure to enable authorities to obtain preliminary approval for new Smoke Control Areas. During the year the Minister issued a -47- TABLE NO. 14 - SMOKE CONTROL AREAS Ma? Ref. No. Name of Area Size (Acres) Premises Date of Declaration Order Confirmed Operative Date 1.

Rockmount 5 253 24.10.62 - 1.10.63 -48- further Circular on the simplification of administrative procedure concurrently with a request that local authorities review their progress in this field and report on their proposals for the period 1962-1966. The revised procedure enables the Council to dispense with the submission of detailed schedules of estimated and final costs so far as private property is concerned. This information continues to be required by the Minister in respect of local authority dwellings. With the advent of the new arrangements there were no staffing or financial difficulties to prevent acceleration of the Smoke Control Programme, and the advancement of the target date for completion. However, any increased rate of progress would also necessitate a greater turnover in the work carried out by private builders and contractors. Many of the local builders are very busy and delays in conversion often occur. Any further acceleration of this work would have aggravated this delay. The estimated number of premises to be brought under Smoke Control for the five-year period 1959-1963 has already been exceeded. If the present annual average rate of 4,000 premises is maintained the programme should be completed by 1968. The original target date was 1972. In the light of the Minister's suggestion that sampling or other methods alternative to full-scale survey prior to the establishment of a Smoke Control Area might form a reliable basis upon which to obtain an appreciation of the situation, and an estimate of the present and future fuel consumption, the Council decided to carry out a pilot scheme by postal survey. By this means the householder is requested to complete a simple questionnaire relating to the present appliances in his property and the amount and type of fuel he uses. The pilot scheme was successful and reduced appreciably the number of visits made by the Public Health Inspectors. It is anticipated that postal surveys will be used extensively in new Areas. The Minister also issued a list of revised principles applicable to the payment of grant. The Council's policy accords with these revised principles. HARDSHIP CASES The Clean Air Act gives the Council discretion to pay greater than a 7/10ths grant where it considers this to be reasonable, to cover cases of financial hardship. The Council decided to pay the whole cost of reasonable works of conversion in the case of applications from owner/occupiers who are retirement pensioners and who are also receiving National Assistance, and four such payments were made -49- during the year. In addition, four payments were made in respect of retirement pensioners who, although eligible for National Assistance, had not applied for it. MEANS OF IGNITION The installation of integral gas ignition, which is efficient and convenient, is normally eligible for grant. The Council has given every encouragement to the installation of gas ignition as the easiest means of lighting solid smokeless fuel. During the year the Minister informed the Council that abnormally high costs, in excess of £12. for an individual dwelling should not be incurred in providing means of ignition. Apart from a slight decrease in the ceiling figure, this did not conflict with the Council's policy. A cost of over £12. has only very rarely been incurred by a resident in a Smoke Control Area. The availability of three makes of electric firelighter has proved to be most useful as an alternative means of ignition for those residents who occupy properties which are not carcased for gas. FUEL SUPPLIES The local supply of proprietary or "premium" smokeless fuels has been maintained. There are several brands from which a choice can be made. The Council continues to advise residents not to place reliance upon any one of these fuels and insist upon the delivery of only one brand. The supply of coke continues to be plentiful throughout the area. PUBLICITY In the Circular previously referred to, the Minister states that changes which local authorities may wish to make in their methods of assessing the fuel requirements, etc. may render unnecessary the preliminary visits by the Council's staff. Therefore, it is of even greater importance to keep individual householders fully informed and advised of the Council's activities. Quite apart from the legal requirements as to publicity, the Council notifies residents by individual letters of every stage of the formation of a Smoke Control Area. Every effort is made to ensure that all householders are acquainted with the various stages through which the Smoke Control Order passes. Arrangements were in hand towards the end of the year for the customary Public Meeting to be held early in 1963 in connection with -50- the Eltham Smoke Control Area. Previous meetings in respect of Smoke Control Areas have been very well attended and many questions have been asked. NEW FURNACES Section 3 of the Clean Air Act requires that new furnaces not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a capacity of 55,000 B.T.Us. shall, as far as practicable, be smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for the Council's approval before the works of installation take place. During 1962, one application for prior approval was received in respect of the installation of a new boilerhouse at a local factory. In addition, two notifications were received of proposals to alter boiler plant with a maximum rating of less than 55,000 B.T.Us. HEALTH EDUCATION Practical health education takes many forms. Although campaigns and publicity drives are spectacular examples, the information and advice given by public health workers in their day-to-day contact with members of the public in all fields must be relied on to shape the climate of opinion towards better health standards. Many public health measures have the force of law behind them, yet it is often found that persuasion and the removal of ignorance promotes a more lasting change than application of the "iron fist". In addition to routine contact, this Council has for many years been active in the promotion of Health Education through the provision of various services designed to inform the public of the health facilities available and to encourage them collectively and individually to make the fullest use of them. Recently, increasing emphasis has been given to the promotion of individual participation in health education and accident prevention, particularly in the home. FILM PROGRAMMES AND TALKS A further increase was noted In visits by the Health Education Unit, in spite of cancellation of a number of bookings due to inclement -51- weather during the winter months. A summary of the work of the Unit is appended below. Average audience figures remained approximately the same as in 1961 with variations from group to group. The largest audiences are found in old people's clubs. Whilst the sound film show still continues to be the most popular, there is increasing interest in informal talks, or talks illustrated by films. This is possibly due to television fulfilling the need for purely visual interest. After programmes where films only are shown, questions are asked, demonstrating perhaps that people are no longer merely content to watch but wish to enquire further. Indications of this move towards "participation" have been noted in other fields. Talks alone last about 30 minutes, including time for questions. When combined with films, or films alone, the programme is arranged to last approximately 60 minutes. Subjects are varied and a number of organisations request further visits on realisation of the many aspects that can be illustrated. In response to the increased emphasis on Safety in the Home many programmes were devoted entirely to this problem, and others devoted to another aspect of Public Health included a short film on home accident prevention.

Other leaflets are included in the monthly distribution of "Better Health" to general practitioners' surgeries and to factories. In addition to seasonal subjects such as "Kill that Fly" campaigns in the summer months, and other general public health information and advice, there is a regular distribution of leaflets and, from time to time, posters on "home accident prevention" and "smoking and health", dealt with more fully below. FOULING BY DOGS - WARNING NOTICES Since 1959 when these notices were first introduced there has been a constant demand for their use. The notices are fixed to lamp-posts in areas where complaints have been received. When it Is felt that the warning has been fully noted they are then transferred to another site. It has frequently been reported that their display in an area results In a material reduction of the nuisance. CLEAN AIR In conjunction with the establishment of Smoke Control Areas, residents affected are kept fully informed on the progress in bringing new Areas into operation. In addition, a large selection of leaflets and a display of appliances is made available. A Public Meeting is held in each area when a Smoke Control Order is confirmed and a mobile display unit is sited in selected roads in the area. Fuller details of the Council's Smoke Control programme can be found on Page 46. -53- SMOKING AND HEALTH The Report on "Smoking and Health" by the Royal College of Physicians issued early in 1962 established a definite link between cigarette smoking and the incidence of lung cancer and bronchitis. This was made the subject of a Ministry of Health Circular which urged immediate action by local authorities in bringing the facts to the attention of the public. In conjunction with the national endeavour to give maximum publicity to the hazards of smoking and the adult's responsibility in discouraging the young from forming the habit, leaflets and posters were distributed to local general practitioners' surgeries and factory canteens, and made available in Council offices and libraries. In addition, through the courtesy of the Road Safety Committee, posters were exhibited on nearly 40 sites throughout the Borough as they were issued by the Ministry of Health. Posters were also displayed on the Department's transport. The incidence of lung cancer is a matter of grave concern and the Council are willing to co-operate in all campaigns aimed at securing a reduction of the smoking habit and the risk incurred by it, and by making "not smoking" fashionable. ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME (a) Formation of Home Safety Committee The Home Safety Act, 1961 empowers those local authorities which are not local health authorities to carry out Home Safety education. These powers had already been invested in this Council since 1957 by Section 82 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act of that year, and have formed a substantial part of the Health Education activities from that time. However, the Council decided that in order to give increased emphasis and publicity to its efforts in combating this problem a Home Safety Committee should be established. The Committee was appointed on the 4th July, 1962 comprising five Members of the Borough Council and representatives of interested organisations. The Committee was appointed with the following Terms of Reference: -54- "To act tinder the general directions of the Health Committee in the exercise of its powers under the Home Safety Act, 1961, as delegated to it by the Council." The first meeting of the Committee was held on the 19th November, 1962 and agreed to deal with the following matters within the Terms of Reference - "To carry out local propaganda to inform the public of the extent and gravity of the home accident problem. To enlist the support of appropriate public and voluntary organisations in this work. To investigate the causes of local home accidents and possible remedies. To participate in any national Home Safety campaign." The Committee were informed of the past and current activities of the Health Department with regard to Home Safety. Some of these have been the subject of previous Reports; the more recent activities are outlined below. Statistics were presented showing the gravity of the problem. A resume of the relevant legislation dealing with aspects of Home Safety was also included for the information of the Committee. Besides deciding to participate in the national Home Safety Training Year, the Committee decided to put a number of measures into immediate effect, notably local store displays, displays at local functions, and lectures to local retail store assistants, youth organisations and schools. (b) Home Accidents - Local Mention is made on Page 14 of this Report of 19 persons who died as a result of accidents at home. Whilst the number of non-fatal accidents is not known with any accuracy, many victims treating themselves or receiving treatment from the family doctor, an indication of the more serious accidents can be gained from the records of the London Ambulance Service. Detailed local information is available only for Division 6 of the London County Council health administrative area, which covers the Boroughs of Woolwich, Greenwich, and Deptford. However, it is known that 463 of the cases referred to occurred in this Borough. -55- Figures for Division 6 are as follows:Falls: On same level 77 One level to another 170 Unspecified 407 Poisoning: Gassing 8 Other 43 Burns 11 Scalds 40 Suffocation - Others: Electrical 3 Cutting and Piercing 40 Impact 24 Unspecified 4l 864 (c) The Oil Heaters Regulations, 1962 These Regulations, made under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, make it an offence for any person to sell an oil heater, or have in his possession for sale or letting an oil heater or component part not complying with the Regulations. The Regulations relate to the construction, design and performance of oil heaters generally and provide for their testing. Local authorities may purchase goods for testing. These Regulations are a useful addition to the existing legislation dealing with Home Safety, but it must be remembered that many accidents involving oil heaters are caused through their misuse. It is, therefore, important that the attention of the public should be drawn to the fact that the manufacturers' instructions should be followed and that the heaters when in use are placed in a draughtfree position, with adequate ventilation of the room, and the practice of airing clothes on or too near them discouraged. Attention should also be drawn to the care which should be taken when refilling with fuel. (d) Current Activities (i) Film Shows and Talks - It has been mentioned above that a large number of the visits by the Health Education Unit were devoted -56- entirely to Safety in the Home and that a number of other programmes included a short film on this subject. In all 4l visits dealt with the subject in detail, and in 28 others the subject of Home Safety was mentioned. Surprise was often expressed at the gravity of the problem. It is believed that this is due to the fact that, in general, home accidents are not "news" and do not attract the same press coverage that the more spectacular road, rail and other accidents receive. There is an urgent need for bringing home the fact that "home is where the accident is" to the public in general. (ii) Leaflets and Literature - The general distribution of leaflets mentioned above received special emphasis in the matter of Home Safety. Much material is distributed during the visits of the Health Education Unit, and by post, to residents of Smoke Control Areas, whilst the Council's Old People's Visitors and Public Health Inspectors offer advice as necessary. (iii) Display - Posters, topical for the time of the year, are displayed on the Department's transport and in the Council offices. In addition, a static display unit was sited where it would catch the notice of members of the public visiting the Department. The display was varied from time to time in order to sustain interest. (iv) Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme - Further courses of instruction on Home Safety were arranged for candidates for the above scheme. Two courses were arranged, one for the first level and one for the second level. Courses covered four 60-minute periods and involved the use of posters, flannelgraph, filmstrips and films. Five girls sat for the first level of the Award, and all passed. Eight girls sat for the second level of the Award and of these seven passed. One of the girls has since received the Gold Award. These courses, commenced in 1961, are a useful means of training future parents and are particularly appropriate in Home Safety Training Year. It is hoped that further youth groups will take advantage of the facilities offered. -57- PREVALENCE AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE The following diseases are compulsorily notifiable in the Borough:- Anthrax, Cholera, Diphtheria, Dysentery, Encephalitis (Acute), Erysipelas, Enteric Fever, Food Poisoning, Leprosy, Malaria, Measles, Membranous Croup, Meningococcal Infection, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Pneumonia (Acute Primary), Pneumonia (Acute Influenzal), Poliomyelitis, Polio-encephalitis, Plague,- Puerperal Pyrexia, Relapsing Fever, Scabies, Scarlet Fever (or Scarlatina), Smallpox, Tuberculosis (all forms). Typhoid Fever (including Paratyphoid), Typhus Fever, Whooping Cough, and Zymotic Enteritis. Cases of infectious disease notified to the Department are immediately visited by the Public Health Inspectors and disinfection is carried out wherever applicable. Where the patient is nursed at home, the Inspectors see that home isolation continues satisfactorily, and at the end of the infectious period, where necessary, the bedding belonging to the patient is removed for treatment at the Disinfecting Station and the room sealed and fumigated. A total of only 301 cases of infectious diseases was notified during the year, being a decrease of 3,051 on the previous year. 119 cases were removed to hospital. The substantial reduction in total notifications is due to the small number of notifications of measles (66, compared with 3,057 the previous year). SMALLPOX For the first time for 29 years the Borough had a confirmed case of Smallpox during the year. The patient, an Insurance Agent of 38 years of age, living In the Woolwich area, first fell ill on the 13th January. He took to his bed on the following day and remained there until his admission to Hospital. Chickenpox was prevalent in the district at the time and this highly modified rash with mild general symptoms was therefore not immediately brought to the notice of the Health Department. Viriological confirmation was obtained and he was removed to Long Reach Hospital on the 24th January. -58- The patient's immediate contacts, about 40 persons, included his clients in the Abbey Wood area whom he saw during the morning of the l3th January, his family (five persons), and his medical attendant. These were all placed under surveillance and other necessary precautions were taken. The patient made rapid and uneventful progress and was discharged home 15 days after admission to Hospital. Although the rash remained sparse, its further development in Hospital was in accord with Smallpox and a further series of tests proved positive for Smallpox. The patient had been well vaccinated whilst in the Armed Forces, lastly in 1945, and this was probably the main factor in producing this highly modified case. The source of infection was not discovered; all possible clues, including several rumours, were followed up but to no purpose. As vaccination was not likely to be effective in preventing the disease at that late stage, the patient's family and his medical attendant, who had all been in close contact with him during the infectious period were given serum injections in addition to vaccination. A number of cases were referred by General Practitioners for further opinion, but fortunately none proved to be Smallpox. One of these was a young child living in a communal establishment in the Borough containing over 100 families. As the possibility of Smallpox could not be immediately excluded, precautions were instituted in respect of over 300 residents there. The child was removed to Long Reach Hospital and was subsequently found to have Chickenpox. In addition to the vaccination of all known contacts, it was found necessary, owing to the public demand, to arrange for mass vaccination. The County Council gave every assistance in arranging emergency vaccination sessions at their clinics and certain schools in the area, and together with the help of all General Practitioners in the Borough, who carried out a large number of vaccinations of their own patients, altogether some 100,000 people were vaccinated during this period. I should like to pay tribute to the excellent work carried out and the co-operation of all concerned. This experience gives further support to the generally held view that Smallpox is not infectious in the incubation period (i.e. before first feeling ill) and tends to support the view that it is also non-infectious in the prodromal stage (i.e. before the rash appears). Further, it seems reasonable to assume that the injection -59- of gamma globulin was a major factor in preventing the disease in the family contacts. None had been vaccinated since infancy, and this, combined with excellent first time vaccination "takes" in all, strongly suggests low immunological protection over the period of exposure. DYSENTERY Of the 32 cases originally notified, three were subsequently confirmed and found to be cases of Sonne Dysentery; one was taken to hospital and a further six suspected cases were also removed to hospital. Numerous specimens were obtained for pathological examination, and the positive cases were excluded from work or school as appropriate under the care of their own Doctors until at least two consecutive negative specimens had been produced. The majority of the non-confirmed cases were found to have Gastro Enteritis or Diarrhoea. MEASIES The number of individual cases of Measles notified during 1962 totalled 66, of which three patients were treated in hospital for various complications. All except five of the notified cases were under the age of 15 years. PUERPERAL PYREXIA Of the 87 notified cases of Puerperal Pyrexia occurring in the Borough, 2k of the patients were not Woolwich mothers. -60- TABLE NO. 15 NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES (EXCLUDING TUBERCULOSIS), 1962 Under 1 yr. 1-4 yrs. 5-14 yrs. 15-44 yrs. 45-64 yrs. 65 and over Total Admitted to Hospital Scarlet Fever _ 5 15 2 1 _ 23 2 Meningococcal Infection _ _ 1 _ _ _ 1 1 Erysipelas _ _ _ 1 8 4 13 1 Dysentery _ _ 1 2 _ _ 3 1 Zymotic Enteritis _ 2 1 _ _ _ 3 1 Pneumonia 3 4 6 12 23 24 72 9 Food Poisoning _ _ - 1 _ _ 1 _ Puerperal Pyrexia _ _ _ 86 1 _ 87 87 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 10 _ _ _ _ _ 10 10 Whooping Cough 3 10 7 1 _ _ 21 2 Measles 3 27 _ 4 1 _ 66 3 Poliomyelitis __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Smallpox _ __ _ 1 _ _ 1 1 Paratyphoid Fever _ _ _ 1 _ _ 1 1 TABLE NO. 16 TUBERCULOSIS Table of Notifications and Deaths compared with Population Borough of Woolwich Year Estimated Civilian Population excluding Army Primary Notifications Deaths from Tuberculosis Deaths per 1,000 of population Total Deaths all Causes Percentage of Tuberculosis Deaths against all Deaths 1952 146,000 195 39 .26 1,667 2.3 1953 146,000 156 29 .20 1,569 1.8 1954 145,000 200 21 .14 1,443 1.4 1955 145,000 154 23 .15 1,537 1.4 1956 144,000 155 22 .14 1,524 1.4 1957 143,000 145 22 .14 1,504 1.4 1958 142,000 101 20 .14 1,514 1.3 1959 142,000 86 14 .09 1,542 .9 1960 143,000 72 9 .06 1,424 .6 1961 146,850 56 16 .11 1,616 .9 1962 148,000 63 10 .06 1,580 .6 -61- TABLE NO. 17 The following is an extract from the Tuberculosis Register for 1962:- Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F Total M F Total Cases notified for the first time. 40 16 56 3 4 7 Other additions to Register during the year, including transfers of patients from other areas. 35 44 79 2 4 6 Cases on Register at 31st December, 1962. 819 673 1,492 40 68 108 The following Table gives the age groups of new cases notified:- Formal Notifications Number of Primary Notifications of New Cases [ 1 1- 4 514 1524 2534 3544 4554 5564 6574 75 & up Total (All ages) PULMONARY - Males - - - 4 5 8 4 13 2 4 40 Females - 1 2 1 3 3 3 - 1 2 16 NON-PULMONARY - Males - - 1 - 1 1 - - - - 3 Females _ - - 2 - 2 _ _ _ _ 4 TOTAL: - 1 3 7 9 14 7 13 3 6 63 MASS X-RAY SERVICE I am indebted to Dr. Morgan, the Director of the South East London Mass X-Ray Service for the following information on the work of the Unit in the Borough during 1962. Dr. Morgan writes:- "13,120 people were x-rayed during 1962, and 19 cases of tuberculosis requiring close supervision or hospital treatment were -62- discovered. This gives an incidence of 1.4 per thousand examined, or 1.8 per thousand when the number of repeat six-monthly examinations has been deducted from the total x-rayed. examinations has been deducted from the total x-rayed. A breakdown of these figures is shown in the following Table:- Numbers examined Cases found Men Women Men Women Beresford Square - regular fortnightly visits. 2,692 (Incl. 1,432 "over 45's") 1,047 3 (Incl. 1 "over 45's") 3 Firms - Routine visits 4,854 1,301 10 2 Firms - Visits mainly in connection with examination of men over fortyfive. 2,04l 6 1 _ Hospitals, etc. 148 602 _ _ Brief public visits, mainly in connection with examination of men over forty-five. 277 152 _ 10,012 3,108 14 5 13,120 19 Two interesting facts arise from this breakdown; first the incidence of significant tuberculosis amongst women x-rayed at Beresford Square, none of whom had been previously examined, was 2.9; and secondly the incidence of men x-rayed at routine visits to firms (six of whom had not been previously examined), was 2.1 per thousand. Of the total of 3,774 not previously x-rayed, 2,479 were men and 1,204 women. Eight and five cases respectively of tuberculosis were found in these groups, which gives an incidence of 3.2 amongst men and 3.9 amongst women." Other Non-Tuberculous Abnormalities included the following: MEN Carcinoma of bronchus 3 Carcinoma of segmoid Secondaries in liver 1 Pneumoconiosis 1 WOMEN Carcinoma of bronchus 1 Pneumonitis 2 Sarcoidosis 4 Bronchiectasis 1 -63- MEN Spontaneous pneumothorax 1 Pneumonitis 13 Bronchiectasis 3 Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema 14 Fibrosis of lung 2 Pleural thickening 3 Calcified haemangioma 1 Pericardial cyst 1 Abnormal clavicle 1 Hiatus hernia 1 Raised diaphragm 1 Retrosternal goitre 1 WOMEN Cystic disease 1 Pleural thickening 1 Hernia 1 Fat deposit 1 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION During 1962 the Department disinfected 190 rooms, including the patients' bedding, following notification of infectious disease. Of these, 91 rooms were occupied by persons suffering from tuberculosis. A total of 1,586 visits was made by the Public Health Inspectors to check on verminous conditions, and 69 premises were found to have minor infestations of bugs or fleas. Disinfestation was carried out by the Department. Many requests were received"throughout the year from residents wishing to dispose of old or unwanted furniture, mattresses or bedding. The items were almost always old or worn-out and sometimes verminous. Altogether 183 such items, including 27 mattresses, 96 items of furniture, seven beds, and 11 sets of bedding, were collected and disposed of at the Council's Destructor. Certificates of Hygiene were issued to accompany six export consignments of rag wipers which had been washed, cleaned and sterilised by a local firm. Nearly 150 tons of other goods for export were subjected to disinfection by the Department and certificates issued. Charges were made for this service to cover the cost of materials used, labour and transport. AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES OF VACCINATION Persons proceeding abroad are required to produce in certain countries evidence of recent successful vaccination Or inoculation. The signatures on these Certificates are not acceptable by the -64- countries concerned unless authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health as being the bona fide signature of a Doctor practising within the area. During 1962, 2,507 Certificates were authenticated by me; 2,458 related to protection against Smallpox, 28 for Cholera, and 21 for T.A.B. inoculation. PERSONAL CLEANSING The Borough Council maintains two personal Cleansing Stations, one being at Plumstead (adjoining the Turkish Baths in Plumstead High Street), and the other at the Lionel Road Centre, Eltham. LABORATORY FACILITIES A large part of the Council's pathological and allied work in relation to the diagnosis, prevention and control of infectious diseases is undertaken at the Southern Group Laboratory at the Hither Green Hospital, Lewisham. This service is provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service. Specimens sent to this Laboratory include samples of milk and ice-cream, samples of food in suspected food poisoning cases, specimens of meat from the local slaughterhouse, and samples of swimming bath water. The following summary relates to the work carried out by the Laboratory on behalf of the Council during 1962:- Type of Specimen No. Examined Food (various, including ice-cream ingredients) 18 Ice-cream (Methylene Blue test) 11 Milk (Statutory tests on Pasteurised, Sterilised and T.T. milks) 423 Water (from swimming baths, paddling and boating pools) 23 Organs from Animal Carcases (Sections) 10 485 -65- The examination of specimens of human origin (mainly swab examinations) for the general practitioners in the Borough, and also specimens referred to the Hospital from local clinics, is undertaken by the Woolwich Group Hospital Management Committee at the Brook Hospital and at the St. Nicholas Hospital. The convenience of this service is much appreciated by the local doctors and by the Department.
