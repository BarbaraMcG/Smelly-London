A6 BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE FULHAM DISTRICT. FIRST GENERALREPORT TO 25th MARCH, 185 7. FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. ABSTRACT OF ACCOUNTS, &c., &c. HAMMERSMITH: PRINTED BY EDWARD PAGE, ANGEL TERRACE. 1857. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE FDLHAM D1ITKICT. FIRST GENERAL REPORT TO 25th MARCH , 1857. Presented May 13 th, 1857. The Board of Works for the Fulham District, in presenting this their 1st Annual Report, beg attention to the fact, that previous to the year 1806 the management of this District was carried out by means of Local Boards with very limited powers, and, in some cases, clashing interests. No Local Act existed under which the duties performed by the several bodies were combined and committed to the controul of one united and supreme authority. The Fulham District Board had, therefore, to enter upon a new state of things—to perform highly onerous duties—to carry out the great principle of selfgovernment under a new and untried Act, without such experience as many of the Metropolitan Parishes had acquired from the working of their own special and private Acts of Parliament. In this state of things they asked the Highway and Lighting Boards of the two Parishes to continue to perform their accustomed duties till the 25th March, 1856, which being kindly conceded, the Board of Works then made a thorough survey of the District, having regard to its Sanitary condition the state of its Roads, Footpaths, Sewers, and Lighting, with the following results:— 1st.—They then found many nuisances abounding, some of a fearful and complex character, which rendered 2 necessary the appointment of a Nuisance Removal and Sanitary Committee, through whose operations there have been no less than 629 cases entered on the Books, embracing matters of a twofold, and even a threefold, character, of which the following is an analysis:— Privies, full, &c. 516 Defective Drainage 291 Unwholesome Houses 194 Cesspools overflowing 44 Stagnant Pools, &c. 88 Miscellaneous. 150 1283 Out of 629 cases there had been removed on the 25th of March 602, representing 1249 nuisances. 2nd.—They found the Roads much out of repair, some having no hard sub-stratum, never having been properly made, and others with good foundation yet in a most impoverished condition, rendering necessary a large outlay for materials and labour. 3rd.—They found the paved footpaths, in most places, much worn, and in an unsafe condition, and the gravelled footpaths much out of repair. The total cost for repaying and repairs is estimated at £16,000, which sum they propose raising by way of Loan, to be repaid, principal and interest, in 20 years. 4th.—Open Sewers and filthy Ditches were abounding in many places, and notwithstanding the heavy debt charged by the late Commissioners of Sewers, they found the District in a most unsatisfactory condition. In the parish of Fulham but little sewerage work had been done, and the many open Ditches and Sewers existing therein prove that, without a large additional outlay, the full benefit of the Metropolis Local Management Act cannot be realized. And with respect to Hammersmith, not only were open Sewers and Ditches found in a most fearful state of nuisance, but also a morass of several acres in extent, having no outlet, situate between the West London Railway and Blythe Lane, which receives the sewerage from a large area, the noxious exhalations from which must be regarded as highly detrimental to health. The state of the open lira n den burgh and Stainford Brook Sewers was also exceedingly unsatisfactory. 3 The Board regret that the large powers given by the Metropolis Local Management Act cannot in the present state of the "main Drainaga" scheme be yet applied, inasmuch as all plans of local Drainage must be subordinate thereto. But, in order that the schememay may be rendered for 4 this District as prefect as possible, this Board have memorialized the Metropolitan Board, as also the Engineers to whom Sir B. Hall has referred the aid scheme, to construct a Sewer along and throughout the High Road of Hammersmith, which would render the Brandenburgh Sewer unnecessary by reason of its sewerage being intercepted at the Black Bull, and would give to a large and densely populated area the means of drainage;—to divert the Stamford Brook Sewer and bring the same along the New Road southwards to Young's Corner, in the High Road, thus giving to another large area the means of Drainage — and to extend the Counter's Creek Sewer from the Notting Hill Crescent along the Uxbridge Road to Starch Green, by which another large area would be provided with the means of Drainage, and also the sewerage would be intercepted from running into the said morass, while the morass itself would be provided also with the means of complete Drainage ; and 5th,—In respect of the Lighting, they found the District most inefficiently provided, and considering the direction of the Act "to well and sufficiently light" the " several Streets," to be imperative, they corresponded with different Gas Companies, from whom they received tenders for the lighting of such parts of the Parishes only as could be reached by their present mains. To this limited supply the Board objected, and with difficulty obtained some extension. The benefit of a general supply the Board hope will, in process of time, be extended to the entire wants of the District. The heavy amount assessed on the District by the Metropolitan Board in respect of the debts of the late Commissioners of Sewers has been the subject of great anxiety to the District Board, who have done all in their power, by Deputations and memorials, to mitigate the amount and to obtain a lengthened period for payment of the debt, but regret that although their efforts were successful in gaining an extension of time for payment from 9 to 20 years, they were unable to obtain any diminution of the original charges. 4 Having regard to the heavy Rates of the District, and particularly the Poor Rate, the Hoard have cordially co-operated with the Vestries of the two Parishes in their endeavours to obtain an equalization of the said Poor Rate over the Metropolis, and have guaranteed the expenses in that behalf. They have also appointed a Deputation of their own body to confer and co-operate with Deputations of Vestries and other District Hoards to oppose the attempt to pay the cost of the formation of Public Parks, &c. in particular Districts by means of a Metropolitan Rate, considering that the cost of such Parks should be paid by the District specially benefitted thereby, or by subsidies from the Consolidated Fund. They have also pursued a rigid system of economy over their own expenditure. Duringtheir first term of office, although extending over a period of 15 months ending 25th of March, 1857, their calls on the General Rate have amounted to only 8d. in the Pound, and out of this they have had to provide for the repairs and alterations of Broadway House, furnishing and fitting up of Offices, all expenses connected with the maintenance of the High ways, and the working of the Act, together with the cost of carrying out the Nuisances Removal Act, which previously was charged on the Poor Rate. The Board have ordered the publishing of an abstract of accounts, furnished by the Auditors, in which is detailed the expenditure of the past period, together with a statement of Assets and Liabilities, and an account of works done and in progress. The Board of Works for the Fulham District express a hope that by the judicious and economical carrying out of the provisions of the important Act under which they are incorporated, the charges upon the Rate-payers will not be materially increased, while they further hope that the improvements already accomplished, and those in contemplation will lead to a large increase of respectable inhabitants, thus more than compensating for the small increase to the local burdens. FULHAM DISTRICT. FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Presented to the Sanitary Committee April 1 Gth, 1857. Gentlemen, In compliance with your request, I beg to lay before you this Report on the Sanitary condition of the Fulham District, abridged from that I submitted to you on the 26th Feb. ult. During the past year 562 Notices have been given for the removal of Nuisances in the District, some of them embracing matters of a two-fold or even three-fold character, to which may be added a large number of Nuisances removed without the intervention of your Committee, under the suggestions of the Inspectors or myself. In the great majority of instances the improvements have been effected without recourse to compulsory proceedings before the Magistrate, but 26 Summonses have been issued and the works asked for in each of them have been ordered to be carried out. The total number of deaths which have occurred in the District during the year 1856, has been 693, of which the Infant mortality still bears a painful proportion, no less than 307 deaths having arisen in children who had not reached beyond 5 years of age. The total Mortality in the Parish of Hammersmith has been 301; and in that of Fulham, 302. In Fulham, however, the number is increased by the Union House being situate within it, together with several private Lunatic Asylums. The number of deaths which have occurred during the year in the former of these Institutions has been 58, and in the latter 8. Deducting these, and 34 of the deaths in the Union House (as a fair proportion) for Hammersmith, it leaves the natural mortality for Fulham at 260, whilst that of Hammersmith will be raised to 425. Only 2 deaths from small-pox have occurred throughout the year, but consumption has proved fatal to no less than 67 individuals, inde- 6 pendcntly of 117 from other diseases of the respiratory organs. The total deaths from diarrhoea in the District have been 48, of which number 37 occurred during the months of July, August, and September. The Population of the Parish of Fulham according to the Census of 1851, was 11,886, and that of Hammersmith, 17,760. The number of births during 1856 was 1039. Large and important powers are vested in the Board of Works under the Metropolis Local Management and Nuisance Removal Acts, but there are yet some serious defects in their details: 1st.—The want of provision to enforce a supply of water for domestic purposes. 2nd.—The distance of 100 feet as prescribed for the construction of compulsory drainage works to premises, in the 73rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, is much too limited for Sanitary purposes in Suburban Districts. 3rd.—No provision is made in either Act for preventing the long detention of dead bodies, a matter of much importance especially during Epidemics, or where the corpse is detained in rooms continuously and simultaneously occupied by the surviving relatives. 4th.—No provision is made, either in these or the Police Acts, for summarily dealing with persons committing a Nuisance, such as opening and discharging the contents of cesspools and privies at improper times of the day. Consequently an offence, highly prejudicial and dangerous to health, may be committed with impunity. 5th.—Some power is manifestly required for enforcing the immediate cleansing and purifying of infected houses, &c. on the outbreak of any fever or epidemic disease. Great improvements have been effected during the year in the state of many of the dwellings of the poor, but much remains to be done, indeed the general sanitary condition of the labouring classes will continue to merit your most anxious consideration. The good work has begun; it needs only a continuation of your efforts, and a proper development of Sanitary measures and appliances, to render the Fulham District one of the most healthful Metropolitan Suburbs. The overcrowding and hitherto neglected condition of the poorer inhabitants has swollen its mortality, but the natural ratio of deaths is slight. Many instances of longevity arc on record, and I purpose at some future period to lay an account of them before you. The fine gravelly anbsoil which exists throughout the District forms a most effectual natural filter for the moisture incidental to its level, and with efficient drainage works affords every opportunity for maintaining its salubrity even with its rapidly increasing population. I need only refer to 7 to the new Albion Road and Starch Green Sewers, as an illustration of what can be effected in this way. By these important Sewers, the Avhole of that neighbourhood has been most effectually drained, and even the swampy excavations for brick-earth rendered dry and capable of cultivation, which is the case at this moment with what, until lately, constituted the Star Lake Fishery. In many parts of the District the supply of water to the poor is very deficient. In the Parish of Fulham I have found on an examination of 1009 houses, that 758 were supplied by pumps or wells; that of this latter number 508 were supplied by 108 pumps only, that the water was laid on to 147, and that 104 were wholly without this necessary article. In a great number of instances also, the pumps were defective, and in others perfectly useless. In 91 cases, the water on merely a cursory examination was found to be very bad and quite unfit for drinking. Of 1810 houses examined in the Parish of Hammersmith, 405 were supplied by 81 pumps, 428 had water laid on, 218 were entirely without, and in 26 cases the water was found to be unfit for drinking, The remainder were supplied by pumps attached to each house. Many of the shallow well waters of the District I have submitted to further investigation, and find them abounding with impurities. They contain in some instances much organic and also a considerable quantity of inorganic matter. In one case, I found the extraordinary quantity of 22 grains of solid residue in a single pint. The Artesian wells of the District supply a pure and wholesome water. The mean temperature of the 9 months, April to December inclusive, was 52. 2. Mean temperature of evaporation 49. 7. Mean dew point temperature 46. 6. Mean degree of humidity 81. (saturation 100.) Amount of rain 19. 0 inches. Mean height of barometer (corrected and reduced) 29. 867 inches. During the above period, the wind blew from West and Northwest on 80 days; North and North-east, on 58 days; East and South-east, on 31 days; South and South-west, on 106 days. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDK. J. BURGE, Medical Officer of Health. OFFICERS OF THE Board of Works for the Fulham District BOARD. Fulham.
