Annual Report of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1925. by CHARLES E. GODDARD, O.B.E., M.D. To the Chairman and Members of the Harrow Urban District Council. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the Public Health and sanitary conditions of the district for the year 1925. By instructions from the Ministry of Health this Report must be a " Survey" Report, and must deal comprehensively with:— (1). The measure of progress made in the area, and the improvement of the public health during the preceding year, and preceding five years. (2). Must contain the extent, character of the changes in that time relating to Housing, Water, Sewerage, Refuse Disposal, etc., etc 8 (3). Mention of any further action of importance in the organisation or development of Public Health services by the Local Authority or considered desirable by the Medical Officer of Health. (4). Must note the Natural and Social conditions of the District Inspection and Supervision of food ; Prevalence and control over Infectious Disease; Maternity and Child Welfare; other Clinics; Hospital Accommodation, etc. As far as possible I have adhered to the sequence as suggested in the instructions of the Ministry. NATURAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS. The Town and District of Harrow-on-the-Hill is situated ten miles from the Marble Arch, five miles from Willesden, five miles from Ealing Broadway, eight miles from Watford, is in the Watford County Court District and in the Gore Petty Sessional Division of Middlesex. It is bounded on the North by Wealdstone Urban District and the Hendon Rural District; on the South by Wembley, Greenford and Uxbridge Rural District; on the West by Uxbridge Rural District; and on the East by Wembley. The Area of the District comprises 2028 acres and includes the main parts of the ecclesiastical parishes of Harrow, Greenhill, Roxeth and St. Peter's. A hundred years ago the old Parish of Harrow included not only Roxeth and Greenhill, but Sudbury, Wembley, Alperton, Kenton, Preston, Harrow Weald and Pinner. The Town of Harrow-on-the-Hill has an altitude of 400 feet above sea-level, and it is from 200 to 250 feet above the plain below, the immediate vicinity of the old Church on the North side and Julian Hill on the South being the highest ground. Between these two points is a long narrow ridge of land, somewhat cresentric in shape, wide enough only for one street, the' East side sloping down abruptly to the water and the pleasant secluded wooded meadowland known as " The Park," the West side to the Lower Road and the Village of Roxeth, the South side to the Mount Park Estate. 9 From the highest part of Harrow it is said that portions of as many as thirteen counties may be seen. The physical features resemble those of the neighbouring heights of Hampstead and Highgate, capped with Bagshot sand in parts and lying on London clay, this clay being about a hundred feet deep more or less, with the Reading beds below averaging 40 or 50 feet, and is found to present considerable variety in composition and colour, brown beds intermingled with yellow sand, dark smoke coloured clay streaked with green sand with pebbles showing occasionally as outcrop. No doubt this clay renders the District damp, but in recent years this has been counter-balanced by better house construction, by repairs after constant inspection, and by drainage. Although so well situated, the Town unquestionably derives its chief importance from the existence of the celebrated School, comprising the old John Lyon School House, the Speech Room, the Chapel, the Vaughan Library, the Museum, the Laboratories, Art School, Sanatorium, Swimming Bath (Ducker), etc., together with about thirty School Houses. Owing to the foresight and generosity of the School authorities and their friends 400 acres of greenlands, chiefly on the East side, have been secured for all time for School purposes, such as playing fields, etc. Nearly all the commercial side of the Town lies to the North, and has developed considerably in the last few years on modern lines. There are two Cinema Halls, one of recent construction, and several assembly rooms, periodically inspected. There are very few factories in the district. Harrow is approached by three lines of railway:— 1. Metropolitan and London and North-Eastern. 2. London Midland and Scottish. 3. District Railway. 4. Another branch of the L.N.E.R. in South Harrow. There are four railway stations in the district. 10 POPULATION. The population of Harrow at the taking of the Census in 1921 was 19,460; recently we have received the estimate for the population from the Registrar General for 1925 as 20,910, and this is the figure up'on which our statistics are based. With 2028 acres, there are 10.3 persons to the acre. The population of Harrow, as in all districts around London, is a very fluctuating one, many changes occurring every year. The working classes are found mostly in the Roxeth district, the residential and commercial elements are fairly evenly distributed. The figures of population for previous decades have already been stated. BIRTH RATE. During the year there were registered as belonging to Harrow 303 births. Of these 165 were males and 138 females (including nine illegitimate male, and four female children). The birth rate for the district in 1925 was 14.5; in 1924 it was 14.8. The average birth rate for the last five years is 15.1. If the birth rate is lower than in former days, it is common knowledge that much greater care is bestowed on the feeding, nurture and the upbringing of young children at the Infant Welfares and in the homes. DEATH RATE. One hundred and ninety-six deaths were registered as having occurred in the Harrow District, or were allotted to Harrow. Of these 94 were males and 102 females. Twenty-two persons (nine males and thirteen females) died over the age of 80 years. The average death rate for the last five years has been 9.5. The death rate for 1925 was 9.3. In 1924 it was 8.9. 11 Among the chief causes were:— Cancer 27 Heart Disease 33 Tuberculosis 21 Cerebral Haemorrhage 12 Pneumonia 12 Influenza 6 Arterio-Sclerosis 12 Other defined diseases 24 Cancer did not claim a greater number of victims during 1925, indeed the number was less than the average (29) for the last five years. On this subject I have nothing to add to my comments of 1923 and 1924. Those who are wise will seek advice early and consent to immediate treatment as soon as a diagnosis can be made. Superficial malignant growths are often cured, many deeper tumours are arrested, sometimes for years. INFANTILE MORTALITY. There were nine deaths recorded in 1925 of children under twelve months, viz., six males and three females. The Infantile Mortality was 29.3 per 1,000 for 1925; 50.00 per 1,000 for 1924; 38.0 in 1923; and 60.6 for 1922. For England and Wales it was 75, so that we may congratulate ourselves on a very low infantile rate this year. The average for the last five years is 48.4. POOR LAW RELIEF. By the courtesy of the Clerk to the Guardians of the Hendon Union, I am able to give the following:— 1925. Average weekly number of persons chargeable at the Redhill Institution, Edgware 37 Average weekly number of persons in receipt of outdoor relief (ordinary) 63 Total amount of ordinary outdoor relief expended during the year £1244 Average weekly number of persons in receipt of outdoor relief (Unemployed) (Less than) 1 Total amount of Unemployment outdoor relief expended during the year £4 12 TUBERCULOSIS. There were 21 deaths from Tuberculosis in 1925. In these days of overcrowding, all cases with active and definite signs of Tuberculosis in the sputum, should be treated at a Sanatorium till cured. Married people often infect each other and other people. On this matter much ignorance and want of care is still displayed. I propose shortly to visit all the cases on our books to ascertain, if possible, why so many are notified in this district, and the present condition of all on the list. Age Period. New Cases.

There were 194 cases of infectious disease notified in Harrow during 1925; of these 26 were Measles, 63 were German Measles, 26 Pulmonary Tuberculosis, 4 Non-Pulmonary T.B. 36 Scarlet Fever, 9 Diphtheria, 13 Pneumonia, 2 Influenzal Pneumonia, 5 Encephalitis Lethargica, 9 Erysipelas, 1 Malaria. 13 You are doubtless aware that, throughout the whole country, Medical Officers of Health are desirous of obtaining a better control of epidemic disease, whether Scarlet Fever, Measles, Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Mumps or Influenza, and yet all must admit that little progress seems to have been made with these particular complaints during the past few years, judging from their prevalence. With regard to Diphtheria, the following facts can be stated with certainty (according to Dr. Rolleston, and confirmed by others), viz.:— (1). That in spite of all Public Health measures relating to hygiene, isolation, improvement in diagnosis and treatment, the incidence of diphtheria has shown a tendency rather to increase, especially in London during the past 15 years. (2). That although no age is exempt, the disease is commonest in childhood, particularly between the ages of three and five, susceptibility diminishing as age advances. (3). That girls are more susceptible, and women, because chiefly of their closer association in nursing. (4). That the anti-toxin treatment which at first (1894) reduced the case mortality from 30 per cent. to 10 per cent., has since 1904 only further reduced it about 2 per cent. (5). That the "carrier" is probably the chief cause of the disease. (You remember when we examined a school of several hundred children we found no less than eight " carriers," whom we isolated at once till rendered negative)., Dissemination of the disease usually takes place by actual contact, in sneezing, coughing, spluttering, spitting, etc., but also, of course, by contact with clothing and articles infected. (6). That wounds are often infected with the germ and occasionally in this way milk is contaminated by the milker; otherwise food and drink are not suspected as factors. 14 (7). That the diphtheria bacillus is so hardy as not to be greatly affected by dryness, heat or cold, though soon destroyed by strong sunlight. Toys, pencils, slates, bedding, clothes, etc., will retain this germ for long periods, especially if kept in the dark. (8). That, contrary to the prevalent belief, drain odours and sewer gas are not responsible, the diphtheria bacillus has not been found in their atmosphere. (9). That cats do not propagate this disease. The Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, though diligently sought for, has not been found in birds or animals at any time (Dr. Savage). (10). That overcrowding unquestionably has a marked effect in raising the incidence of diphtheria. Now with regard to prevention of Diphtheria we can always ascertain the susceptibility, or the immunity of a person, by the application of the Schick test, a very harmless and simple procedure. If the result is positive, the patient can be immunised by an injection of antitoxin, or with toxin-antitoxin, but we await further experience of these methods and definite instructions from the Ministry as to their general application in schools and institutions. We do know, however, that remarkable results have been claimed for these measures, and it is alleged that Diphtheria has shown a marked decline in recent years. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. Your Isolation Hospital, constructed to accommodate 30 patients, is in a satisfactory condition. With an efficient Matron and good staff the work is carried on without trouble and friction. The wards, premises and gardens are kept in good order all the year round. 15 All patients were treated there by their own doctors. During 1925, 32 cases of Scarlet Fever, two cases of Measles, nine cases of Diphtheria, one case of Erysipelas were admitted from this district. ROOMS AND ARTICLES DISINFECTED DURING THE YEAR. After:— Rooms. Articles. Scarlet Fever 171 557 Diphtheria 38 170 Consumption 64 95 Cancer and other Diseases (not notifiable) 184 887 457 1709 ARTIFICIAL SUNLIGHT. You are aware that it is proposed, as soon as funds admit, to establish a centre under the auspices of the Council of Child Welfare in College Road, subject to the approval of the Ministry and the Council. With regard to Artificial Sunlight the following points at present known will be of interest to you. The plant itself is not of great cost, between £50 and £70, but it must be controlled by those only who have experience of its use and of its dangers. The application of this remedy implies the employment, therefore, of an expert who would be responsible, a small staff and a fair-sized room. The results of treatment by ultra violet radiation are in many cases remarkable, especially in rickets and in debilitating conditions of childhood, and of considerable value in later life and even in old age. Children, thin and anaemic and delicate, and predisposed to tuberculosis, in a few months 16 become robust and vigorous in body, alert in mind and totally changed. Natural sunlight is, of course, to be preferred and what has been effected in Alpine regions has been carried out scientifically in Hayling Island; also in Sussex and elsewhere. Unfortunately sunny days are few in these isles, so that recourse must be had to artificial light, and the results have already fully justified the expense incurred. Professor Leonard Hill, whom I have met recently and whom I have heard lecture on different occasions, is the chief exponent of Artificial Sunlight. He has, with others, during 1924-5 done much research work and is still actively engaged in this cause. He lays stress on the fact that long exposure is not necessary, ten to twenty minutes, or half an hour three or four times a week may be sufficient. He extols the modern dress of women and deplores that of men. Lie states that in the Tropics Europeans have too much sunlight and undoubtedly suffer therefrom. He says that the beneficial rays may proceed from white fleecy clouds, and from blue sky when the sun is absent, especially in a clear smokeless atmosphere; that the ultra violet rays are not potent, indeed are arrested, in passing through ordinary glass windows. Hence it is essential that all should take advantage of natural sunlight in the open air, especially on a clear day; we realise now more fully the cause of much of the pallor of the faces of the women and children in the slums. Of course, we have all known something of this for years, but no one before has elaborated a system or founded a science on ultra violet radiation. In these days of overcrowding we ought to have flat roofs and roof gardens. We shall hear of London schools being supplied with these rays in every large classroom and the children, with very little clothing and eyes protected, becoming sunburnt, rapidly improving in muscular development, with fine soft skin, increased appetite, and much less prone to infectious disease. In the meantime you will do well to assist in the establishment of a separate clinic for Harrow. 17 MATERNITY AND INFANT WELFARE. The Harrow Medical activities in College Road are always referred to in all the Annual Reports. Their important work covers a large field and includes the following Clinics:— (1). Maternity and Child Welfare. (2). Ante-Natal Clinic. (3). Massage Clinic. (4). Observation Ward. (5). Throat, Nose and Ear. (6). Eye Clinic. (7). Dental Clinic. (8). Maternity Hostel. (1). The Infant Welfare Department, under the care of Dr. Brand, showed a satisfactory year's work during 1925, both in Greenhill and Roxeth. Marasmic babies have well responded to diet and supervision of hygiene, except one case which was referred to the London Hospital, and improved at once under a course of artificial sunlight. (2). At the Ante-Natal Clinic, for wrhich Dr. F. Huxley is responsible, 166 new patients were examined; of these 68 were first cases, 13 attended for diagnosis of pregnancy and post-natal trouble. Minor complications for pregnancy were treated, and mal-presentation adjusted. Three cases were of breech presentation and four with definitely contracted pelvis. (3). The Massage Clinic has during 1925 done much useful work under the superintendence of Miss Townsend, who reports regular attendance. Several children have been referred to this Clinic from London Hospitals. Miss Warrener has assisted greatly by visiting patients in cases of non-attendance, and Miss Chabot has been responsible for the plaster bandaging, etc. Thanks are again due to Dr. Mayne for his good advice and inspections. 18 (4). The Observation Ward. Thirteen Harrow cases were treated during 1925, the average stay being four weeks and a half. Sixty-two children were admitted for one night after tonsil and adenoid operations. This Ward was closed from, April to September owing to the difficulties in engaging staff. The Observation Ward was opened in January, 1920, for ailing babies suffering from errors of nutrition and for recovery after operation for circumcision, tonsils and adenoids. During the past five years several cases of pneumonia and bronchitis have been successfully treated. Dr. Mayne has acted as Hon. Consultant, and the resident medical men have been able to attend their own patients. It will be interesting to observe how far the work carried on here will be covered by the newly established wing for children at the Harrow Hospital. (5.) Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic. In the 21 sessions, 107 Harrow patients were seen, 253 attendances were made, 55 children treated under five years of age, 48 children and adults over five years of age and four expectant and nursing mothers. (6). Eye Clinic. In the eleven sessions, 81 Harrow patients attended. Attendances 142; 24 children under five years of age and ten expectant and nursing mothers, Attendances 64; 47 adults and children over five years of age, Attendances 78. (7). The Dental Clinic. Under the able supervision of Miss Goodman (assisted by Miss Warmer) this Clinic did much good work in 1925. 19 Miss Goodman reports that on examining the children of the seven schools, who had been inspected and treated each year, very few required further treatment. She still met parents who declined treatment, others who said they would go to their own dentist and did not, and others who signed papers consenting with no intention of attending. On the whole the parents welcome a dental inspection at the schools. Illness accounted for many absentees. The help of the V.A.D. Nurses was much appreciated and enabled the staff to get over the work more expeditiously. (8). The Maternity Hostel. Seventy-nine mothers were confined during the year 1925, the average stay in the Hostel being 15 days. The resident medical practitioners of Harrow, members of the British Medical Association, have, for some years drawn attention to the class of patient treated at this Hostel, to the method of admission and to other points, and especially their reference to the Ante-natal Clinic. They still regard the matter with grave concern. Recently the specially appointed Sub-Committee have again met the Hostel Committee to place the doctors' suggestions before that Board. Whilst the matter is still sub judice, it may be stated, without breach of confidence, that by the goodwill displayed by both parties, a friendly and amicable settlement by compromise is likely to be effected in the next few weeks. There can be no doubt that a much larger Hostel is required for Harrow and district, one containing from 20 to 25 beds for instance. Unfortunately the Hendon Rural District and also the Wembley Urban District have definitely declined to be members of a con-joint scheme located in Harrow, so that the possibility of any co-operation of the neighbouring districts for this purpose must be abandoned, or, at any rate, deferred for the present. 20 If the members of the present strong Committee of the Hostel, who have done so much good work in the past, could see their way to unite with the local medical men in this cause, adequate accommodation would be found in better quarters and an institution suitable in every way to the needs of this growing district would soon be provided. It would be proper here to state how these several activities are supported and paid for:— The two Baby Clinics are supported by the Harrow Council. The Ante-natal, Massage and Dental Clinics are supported partly by the Council and partly by the Council of Child Welfare. The Eye, the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinics are supported by the Council of Child Welfare. The Maternity Hostel derives its funds from the Ministry of Health, the Harrow Council, the Wealdstone Council, voluntary contributions, and from the patients. MILK GRANTS. The supply of milk to mothers and children has been continued during the year, and the total amount of milk (Grade "A") supplied under this scheme was 879 pints and 186 packets of dried milk (in lieu of milk) to nine applicants. At the end of the year four mothers were receiving milk free of cost. All these cases were recommended by the Health Visitors, certified by the Medical Officer at the Clinic, and approved by the Medical Officer of Health for the Public Health Committee. One is rather surprised that under this scheme the applicants for this good milk are not more numerous, and one wonders why generally the working classes do not buy more of this good and comparatively cheap food, fresh in bottles daily, for consumption at the midday meal. 21 THE HARROW CLINICS AND TREATMENT CENTRES.

The District Nursing Fund, under the superintendence of Miss Colbeck, has a staff of four nurses, viz., Nurse M. Byerley, Nurse Stevenson, Nurse Pitcairn and Nurse O'Neill, who do excellent general nursing. The Council makes an annual grant to this fund for their services as part-time Heatlh Visitors. On special forms these nurses keep me informed of cases of infectious disease coming under their notice, epidemic diarrhoea, sore throats, etc. MATERNITY NURSE. Nurse Kindell continues to act as the attendant nurse at the Ante-natal Clinic, and for emergent cases of parturition; otherwise she is privately engaged as a midwife, or with the resident medical practitioners. Her work for 1925 included attendances at all the sessions (Tuesday afternoons); visits to expectant mothers (treatment as Dr. Huxley advises, e.g., bandaging varicose veins, etc.); 51 maternity cases attended in the district, of which there were 33 doctors' cases, for 14 days as maternity nurse, and 18 midwifery cases attended in ten days, and these patients attended the Ante-natal Clinc.

The district is served by the Colne Valley Water Company with a water that always obtains a good report after analysis as a drinking water. The water is obtained from deep wells sunk in the chalk to a depth of about 250 feet in the Colne Valley, near Bushey. There is a constant supply, and it is softened at the works by a special process, and altogether may be considered good in quality and sufficient in quantity. There was still in 1925 some deposit of chalk on first drawing off, but, recently, owing to the opening of a large reservoir containing eight million gallons, this trouble is less apparent. Many miles of new pipes have been laid in Harrow and neighbourhood owing to the very rapid development of this part of Middlesex. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. By the courtesy of your Surveyor (Mr. Bennetts) I have obtained the following particulars, viz.:— During the year 1925 plans have been approved for 316 houses, 22 combined shops and dwellings, ten other shops, and 121 additions, temporary buildings, etc. 235 houses, 24 combined shops and dwellings, and eight other shops have been completed and occupied. Official inspections made, 1240. Station Road has been widened at a cost of about £9000. This is a decided improvement to this important thoroughfare. Widenings and improvements have also been carried out at Bessborough Road (bottom of West Street), Northolt Road (near Three Horse Shoes), Sudbury Hill, and Roxeth Hill. An important widening and improvement of Eastcote Lane was commenced. This lane hitherto has been very dangerous owing to sharp turns which, by the improvement will be obviated. The scheme for the drainage of South Harrow, involving an outlay of about £30,000 was approved, and is being proceeded with. This will give facilities for the drainage of a very large area, which is in course of 24 development, and which will now7 develop even more rapidly. Many houses for years have only had cesspools for means of drainage, and will soon be able to connect up. The Council were involved in litigation on the question of the making up of Bonnersfield Lane as a private street, the owners of the property abutting thereon contending that it was a Public Highway. The Council won the case at the High Court and also at the Court of Appeal. The private streets Rosebank and Fernbank Avenues have been declared highways repairable by the inhabitants at large. The private streets, Lower Vaughan Road and Bouverie Road have been made up under the Public Health Act, 1875. The new 12in. surface water sewer has been laid in Eastcote Lane. SWIMMING BATH. The Open-air Swimming Bath continued to be well patronised. No fewer that 61,755 tickets were issued as against 46,500 the previous year. The filtration plant has proved a great success. It was not necessary to clear out the Bath during the whole season, and at the end the water was quite clear. No doubt the fact that the bathers always had clean water to bathe in had much to do with the increased number of bathers. This must be one of the finest Open-air Swimming Baths in the kingdom, and is a great asset to the district. SEWAGE DISPOSAL. The sewage disposal works have on the whole been satisfactory. One complaint was received of a sample of effluent taken by the Middlesex County Council, otherwise all tests of effluent have been satisfactory. The proposed new tanks to be constructed under the South Harrow Drainage Scheme will assist in the works of purification. 25 HOUSE REFUSE DISPOSAL. The new method of collecting by a combination of tractor and horses with covered trailers, for the Greenhill district was installed during 1925, and is an improvement on the old method. A further tractor and trailers and also a Morris van is to be added; the latter will be used mainly for the purpose of collecting shop refuse. The refuse material is collected from every house in the district once a week. RECREATION GROUNDS AND OPEN SPACES. Improvements have been carried out on the various Recreation Grounds, including the erection of two new Pavilions on the Harrow Recreation Ground, one new pavilion and three dressing tents on the Roxeth Recreation Ground. The tennis courts, cricket pitches, etc., have been well patronised. The small Putting Green on the Harrow Recreation Ground proved to be very popular, and was used to the extent of 8,640 rounds. An eighteen-hole Putting Green has been constructed on the West Harrow Recreation Ground, and it is hoped that this will also be appreciated. The public have every reason to be proud of the excellent facilities given for recreation purposes, which have been very favourably commented upon by deputations from other districts. The facilities are used not only by residents in the district, but by many residents in the adjoining neighbourhoods. AMBULANCE FACILITIES. (1). For infectious diseases: Two ambulances, one for cases of Diphtheria and one for Scarlet Fever. (2). For non-infectious and accident cases. The Council's ambulance is housed at the Fire Station and is driven by the Fireman, who are on call at any time of the day or night. 26 The number of cases removed during the year 1925 was 344, the ambulance travelling 4562 miles. Of these 344 cases, 90 were taken to the Harrow Hospital, 39 to the Hendon Irfirmary, 154 to London Hospitals, and 61 to residences in or about the district. 160 were Harrow cases. 133 were Wembley cases. 30 were Wealdstone cases. 26 cases were from surrounding districts. A pro rata charge is. of course, met by Wembley and Wealdstone for their patients. In nearly all cases,. certainly wherever possible, the cost is recovered, but the Council desire above all things to provide a ready and efficient service. PUBLIC CONVENIENCE. In addition to those already established in the district, negotiations were carried out to secure a site for a Public Convenience in the Greenhill district, and eventually one was secured in Havelock Place. An up-todate convenience for both sexes is now being erected. THE MORTUARY. The Mortuary was used on 15 occasions. I would like to mention with regard to the Mortuary that you may at any time find it insufficient for your needs in case of accident or severe epidemic or infectiousdisease in crowded tenements. A chamber should be added to accommodate two or three more bodies.

Renewed efforts were made to get the Ministry of Health to sanction the erection of the 22 houses required to complete the Council's Housing Estate. Further schemes were submitted and finally one was agreed to, and the houses are being erected and will probably be completed during the coming year. There is unquestionably considerable overcrowding in the district, and smaller and less expensive houses or flats are urgently needed. Of the 186 houses on the Council's Estate 32 are of the non-parlour variety, 126 parlour, and 14 bungalow type. There are 16 parlour houses in course of erection.

This appointment (Mr. Groom) has been most opportune with regard especially to the house-to-house inspections. Mr. Groom has been able to give a considerable amount of his time to this department of the health work, entailing a considerable number of notices, etc., as detailed in the tables subjoined. 29 SANITARY WORK EXECUTED.

For the past five years I have, in company with the Chief Sanitary Inspector, visited all the cowsheds every month at 7 a.m., not necessarily on the same day in each month. There is no doubt that such inspection has wrought a great change in the production and treatment of milk in the district. From every cowshed now the milk is relatively clean on delivery, and there is also a marked improvement in the imported supply, due to the action of certain County Medical Officers, but I am still not satisfied that the best efforts are made to obtain really clean milk with a low bacterial count at these ordinary farms, and one rather despairs of further improvement, partly from the fact that few farmers realize the importance of the new scientific technique of the business, partly due to the employment of cheap and ignorant labour. Only one of the local dairy farmers has been induced to enter the annual County Clean Milk Competition. The Dairies and Milk Shops are inspected frequently and are usually found in satisfactory condition. During February, 1925, we found it necessary to recommend the Council to prosecute a dairyman for selling milk without being registered and for the dirty condition of his premises, the same being an infringement of the Milk Regulations. A conviction was obtained. Your Veterinary Surgeon (Mr. Widden) makes careful inspection twice a year of all milch cows in the district and issues a report of the sheds and of the animals for your Public Health Committee. During the year 276 visits were made to Cowsheds, and 148 to Dairies. PUBLIC HEALTH (MEAT) REGULATIONS, 1924. As soon as the New Meat Regulations were received from the Ministry, I called a conference of the Medical Officers of Health, and the Chief Sanitary Inspectors of all the surrounding districts, to endeavour to ascertain the exact scope and interpretation of the clauses, and, if possible, to agree upon a common action. 31 The Medical Officers of Health of Willesden, Hendon Urban, Harrow, Wembley, Ruislip-Northwood and Kingsbury, and the Chief Sanitary Inspectors of Willesden, Hondon Urban, Harrow, Wembley, Wealdstone, Greenford and Ruislip-Northwood. A certain uniformity of action was agreed upon, but later a further circular was received from the Ministry which somewhat restricted our action, especially in the matter of glass fronts to butchers' shops. However, these regulations have resulted in marked improvement in the treatment of meat in the district, and no doubt, in the light of further experience, the Ministry will be able to grant greater power of control.

As noted in the previous Reports, they are nearly all too small for the large amount of work carried on. During the year 61 inspections were made. 32 During the past few years I have met the bakers and the butchers and have addressed them on the need for greater care in the preparation, storage, exhibition and distribution of food. I have also addressed the members of the Harrow Chamber of Commerce on the same matters, and enlisted their sympathy and support. There can be no doubt that much improvement has resulted generally, though much still remains to be done. In July I attended the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, held at Bath, and read a paper entitled "Food Manipulation in Relation to Health," a paper which enjoined the need for greater care in the preparation, storage, exhibition and distribution of food generally, and in the wrapping of bread in particular.
