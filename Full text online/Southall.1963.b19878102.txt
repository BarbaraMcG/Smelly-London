MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the 73rd Annual Report on the health and circumstances of the population of the Borough of Southall. The general standard of health of the population continued to be good. There was a rise in the Death Rate. Although Cancer was still the biggest individual cause of death, there were signs of a decrease, and there were fewer deaths from Lung Cancer than from Cancer of the Alimentary Tract. The figure for Road Accident deaths showed a disturbing increase, as did that for violent deaths as a whole. 1963 was a bad year for Home Accidents also especially if the number of persons injured in home accidents rose at the rate of the increase in deaths from this cause. The Birth Rate has been rising rapidly and was very high in 1963, the highest for 30 years. This combined with a low Infant Mortality Rate is likely to bring problems of increased overcrowding of homes and schools very soon. It is also distressing to have to record a significant rise in illegitimate infant births in the last three years and this may link up to some degree with the number of prematurely born children, the figure for which has doubled in the last seven years. There were no large outbreaks of infectious disease or food poisoning. The finishing of the Sonne Dysentery from the previous year caused a great deal of work in visits and specimen investigation, and there were the occasional alarms when typhoid or smallpox suspects entered the district. Tuberculosis was notified in a larger number of cases. There were three deaths from this cause, one fewer than in the previous year. The increase in the figure for multiple cases 1 Manor House, Southall, Telephone Numbers: SOU 3621-2 SOU 5060 2 of this disease is noteworthy—larger families need larger houses so that a patient can have a separate bedroom, or else there must be an increase in the amount of time that a patient is kept in hospital; the present method of allowing sputum positive patients to stay at home is not good unless there is certainty that the patient will sleep alone and follow strictly all the rules of hygiene. Again it can be seen from the Report how much time and effort is given freely and gladly by citizens of this Borough, quietly working for the welfare of the handicapped, the aged, and the sick, without payment or expectation of reward, but kindly and sympathetically helping to secure a better life for the less fortunate. The combination of voluntary and statutory Welfare services is one of the glories of our country, and is admired throughout the World. The exceptionally long spell of severely cold weather in the early part of the year brought problems—the maintenance of water supplies and sanitary facilities was difficult—old fashioned ideas of plumbing seem to persist in this country where ugly service pipes still scar the outsides of the great majority of buildings and children at school cross acres of pavements to the sanitary blocks; and a healthy hard frost immediately freezes all this exposed plumbing. The work of the Inspectors during the year was very heavy, particularly with regard to the speeding up of the Smoke Control Areas programme and the maintenance of, occupation of, and sanitary standards for, houses in multiple occupation, but the Report shows a satisfying amount of progress in keeping the citizens free from infection and nuisance. I am greatly indebted to all who have given information for use in this Report, and to all the energetic and loyal members of the Departmental staff who have helped to prepare the book, and who have done so much throughout the year for the health of the citizens. 1 am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient_Servant, Medical Officer of Health Acknowledgments to:— The County Medical Officer The County Welfare Officer The County Public Control Officer The Area Medical Officer The Area Welfare Officer The Physician Superintendent, St. Bernard's Hospital The Medical Superintendent, Hillingdon Hospital The Secretary, Uxbridge Group, N.W.M.R.

The Borough is highly industrial, containing large factories for food processing and engineering, and many smaller factories producing a great variety of semi-finished or finished products. The development of the Borough has been rapid, mainly within the present century, and so there has been little slum clearance to deal with, but there is still a good deal of substandard housing, i.e. houses without baths or without hot water supply, and some without indoor sanitary accommodation. The problem of multi-occupation of such houses by 5 members of the same family or by different families brings problems of cleanliness and the maintenance of freedom from infectious disease and from diseases encouraged by faulty hygiene. Areas of land in two neighbouring Boroughs have been used for Southall Council house building because of the shortage of land within the Borough and to assist with the housing needs of the people of Southall, and use is also made of New Town housing. The Youth Employment Officer also made the following comments:—"The number of young people registering as unemployed was slightly higher than in 1962 (15) but even so we had 65 unfilled vacancies. These we were unable to fill mainly because the young people available did not satisfy the necessary requirements, lacking either the educational qualification or personal qualities demanded by employers. As there are now only two schoolleaving periods each year, i.e. Easter and Summer, it is possible that many of the vacancies now on our books would have been filled had we had a number of school-leavers at Christmas, as in the past. It is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain employment for boys and girls at the lower end of the ability scale, and with the impending impact of automation, these handicapped youngsters will be at an even greater disadvantage. It is suggested that the provision of a considerable increase in the number and scope of Sheltered workshops may need serious consideration." Swimming Baths The Southall Borough Council maintains an outdoor swimming pool in the Recreation Ground, which is one of the public parks, and this pool is used very fully during the summer months. The surface area of the bath is 3,600 square feet (120 feet by 30 feet), cubic capacity 16,500 cubic feet (110,000 gallons). The water is treated by break-point chlorination and the normal chlorine content of 1.0 parts per million at the shallow end and 0.7 at the deep end is maintained. During peak periods this is increased to 4.0 parts per million at the shallow end in order to obtain 2.0 parts per million at the deep end. A minimum of three samples of the water are taken daily by the Bath Manager's staff for chlorine and pH reading, and from time to time bacteriological testing is carried out by officers from the Public Health Department. At no time during 1963 was the water found to be unsatisfactory for use by swimmers. As this bath is closed during the winter months it can be fully emptied and repaired, if necessary, and cleansed each year before the spring opening. During 1963, the total number of persons using the bath was 22,685 (18,189 in 1962). The average number of persons attending per day was 148. The maximum number at any one session was 350. 6 Figures obtained by courtesy of the Manager of the Southall Employment Exchange and the Youth Employment Officer show the general trend of the employment position in Southall during the year, and are as follows:— Men Women Number of person registered as unemployed at Southall Employment Exchange on- 10th December, 1962 275 42 9th December, 1963 249 40 Number of unfilled vacancies as at— 5th December, 1962 90 87 4th December, 1963 151 86 Boys Girls Number of persons registered as unemployed at the Youth Employment Office on— 10th December, 1962 11 4 9th December, 1963 13 8 Number of unfilled vacancies as at— 5th December, 1962 21 33 9th December, 1963 28 37 An indoor swimming bath was opened at North Road School in the latter part of 1962 for the use of the pupils. Sampling of the water produced satisfactory results during 1963. Paddling Pool A paddling pool for young children is available in Cranleigh Gardens Play Park. The capacity of the pool is approximately 15,500 gallons with depth from 1½ inches to 9 inches. The water of the pool is free-running and is treated by continuous chlorination for hygiene purposes. Like the swimming bath, this pool was in constant and very full use during the summer of 1963. School Playing Fields For the physical training, school games and recreation of school children the total acreage of school playing fields in Southall is approximately 21.6. At present considerable use is also made of the play areas within the Council's public parks and negotiations are not yet completed for the acquisition of a further two and a half acres of Council owned land suitable for playing fields. 7 VITAL STATISTICS Total Deaths, 776 (Males 370; Females 406) Crude Death Rate, 14-38 For extracts from vital statistics and causes of death, see Appendix, Tables I, II and III Deaths and Death Rate The death rate, i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 total population, rose in 1963 to a very high figure, but this figure is calculated on an estimated population lower than that of last year. The corrected death rate (see below) is lower than in 1962. Below is shown the comparative figures for the past ten years. Year Crude Death Rate 1954 12.16 1955 11.92 1956 12.25 1957 13.02 1958 12.04 1959 12.12 1960 13.15 1961 13.63 1962 13.60 1963 14.38 From Table II it will be seen that the proportion of men dying over the age of 65 is 62% and those over the age of 75—32%; among women the proportions are 76% over 65 and 54% over 75. In looking at these figures, it is interesting to think that only 120 years ago—in 1844, the expectation of life was 40 years for males and 42 years for females. The principal causes of death were cancer, disease of the circulation other than coronary, heart disease, and coronary disease, in that order. The figure for cancer deaths rose steeply from 118 in 1960 to 148 in 1961 but in 1962 dropped to 138 then in 1963 fell to 130. Lung cancer accounted for 35 of these (31 male, 4 female)—there were 44 in 1961 and 36 in 1962: the highest number of cancer deaths in 1963 occurred in the alimentary tract, i.e. 38 consisting of 3 sited in the oesophagus, 13 in the stomach, 22 in the intestine. There were no deaths from whooping cough, diphtheria or poliomyelitis. Eleven deaths were attributed to influenza. There were three deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of outside deaths, i.e. of Southall residents who died in Hillingdon Hospital, other Middlesex hospitals and hospitals outside the County boundaries, including various London hospitals, was 328 (males 185, females 143). Deaths of institution inmates (including patients from Southall addresses and from outside areas) number as follows: St. Bernard's Hospital, 229 (males 74 and females 155); Mount Pleasant Hospital, 23 (males 8 and females 15); Southall-Norwood Hospital, 12 (males 8 and females 4); in addition 2 deaths (both male) occurred of persons belonging to other districts. In 1963, nine people died as the result of motor vehicle accidents, as compared with three in 1962. The total number of deaths from violent causes was recorded as 38 in 1963 as compared with 24 in 1962. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then, gives a corrected death rate of 12.08 (12-24 in 1962) compared with the rate for England and Wales as a whole, which was 12.2. Southall's figure is therefore below the national average, for the first time since 1959. For distribution of deaths in the various wards, see Appendix, Table IV. 8 Births and Birth Rate (Figures for 1962 are given in brackets.) The total number of live births belonging to the district, whether occurring within or outside the district, was 1,220 (1,065). The illegitimate live births were 106 (99). There were 19 stillbirths (20), 15 legitimate and 4 illegitimate. A rise in the birth rate (live and still) is recorded from 15-58 in 1960 to 18-86 in 1961, 20.05 in 1962, and now 22.96 in 1963. This figure is the highest in 30 years, (see Graph A) and almost double the figure for 1952. The birth rate is the number of births per 1,000 of the total population. One hundred and six illegitimate live births were registered during 1963. The following table gives the comparative figures for the past 25 years, showing that 1963 has the highest figure recorded during that period. Year No. of Illegitimate Live Births 1939 34 1940 31 1941 30 1942 38 1943 39 1944 55 1945 60 1946 56 1947 53 1948 53 1949 39 1950 36 1951 28 1952 26 1953 31 1954 23 1955 21 1956 38 1957 37 1958 42 1959 55 1960 66 1961 80 1962 99 1963 106 To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. The corrected live birth rate was 23.65. The corresponding rate for the whole of England and Wales was 18.2; this was the highest national birth rate since the year 1947 and the rate for Southall was well above it. Infant Mortality Infant mortality, i.e. the number of children dying before reaching the age of one year, rose slightly in 1963. Twenty-seven infants died compared with 24 in 1962, giving a rate of 22.13 per 1,000 live births compared with 22.54 in 1962. Of these 27 deaths, two died at home and twenty-five in hospital. Twenty-one infants (eleven male and ten female) died within the first four weeks after birth. Nineteen babies were stillborn, making a stillbirth rate of 15.6 compared with the national figure of 17.3 per 1,000 live births. 9 10 Graph A Birth Rate — 1934 to 1963 11 Graph B Infant Mortality Rate from 1900 to 1963 Table V gives the causes of infant deaths under the age of one year. Graph B on page 11 shows the trend of the infant mortality rate since 1900. The corresponding rate for Middlesex County was 18.7 and for England and Wales as a whole was 20.9. Premature Infants Ninety-eight premature infants were born alive during the year; 87 were born in hospital, and of these, 76 were surviving at the end of one month; 11 were born at home or in a nursing home and all of these were surviving at the end of one month. There were 13 premature stillbirths, all occurring in hospital. Premature Births and Stillbirths during past 7 Years Year Born at Home Born in Hospital Births Died within one month Stillbirths Births Died within one month Stillbirths 1957 8 2 - 40 7 6 1958 8 - — 49 8 3 1959 7 — - 48 6 3 1960 15 - 1 45 7 7 1961 12 1 — 63 17 16 1962 6 - — 83 8 10 1963 11 — — 87 11 13 Maternal Morbidity Two cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified direct to the Department during 1963; in addition 48 cases were notified to other authorities. The classification of puerperal pyrexia is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4° Fahrenheit (38° Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage." 12 13 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The number of infectious disease cases notified during 1963 rose, principally because of the biennial upsurge of measles. Dysentery figures were high—but lower than in 1962, and there was a rise in the figures for pneumonia and whooping cough. See Tables VII and VIII on pages 63 and 64. Details of each disease individually can be found below. Monthly Bulletins of Incidence of Infectious Disease These bulletins were circulated monthly to all general practitioners in the Borough, and, in addition to information with regard to infectious diseases occurring during the previous month, any topical matter, or incident of mutual interest to general practitioners and the Public Health Service, was also included. Poliomyelitis No notifications of anterior poliomyelitis were received in 1963. Vaccination against poliomyelitis, which is organised by Middlesex County Health Department, continued throughout 1963 and details are as follows:— Number of persons who had received two injections at any time up to 31st December, 1963 19,407 Number of persons who received 3 oral doses. Born in the following years: 1963 1962 1944-1961 1934-1943 Others Total 59 474 211 44 32 820 Number of persons who received 2 injections. Born in the following years: 1963 1962 1944-1961 1934-1943 Others Total 26 89 32 7 21 175 Number of persons who received 3 injections. Born in the following years: 1963 1962 1944-1961 1934-1943 Others Total 1 35 80 29 45 190 Number of persons who received an oral boost after 2 injections. Born in the following years: 1963 1962 1944-1961 1934-1943 Others Total — 2 86 12 26 126 Influenza Influenza was widespread during the early months of 1963, i.e. during January, February and March. Hospital admissions were curtailed because of the pressure of demand for admission attributed to cases of influenza with complications. Eleven deaths from influenza occurred during those three months. Dysentery One hundred and twelve notifications for dysentery were received in 1963. This figure, though still high, was less than half that for 1962 and occurred principally in the first months of the year as a continuance of the outbreak commencing at the end of 1962. About half of the cases notified were subsequently not confirmed bacteriologically, and the outbreak did not extend outside a small area of the Borough. Smallpox Vaccinations:— 1963 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 113 187 29 15 25 369 Re-vaccination — — 4 18 130 152 14 86 school children between the ages of 5 and 12 were given a fourth injection. 327 school children between the ages of 5 and 12 were given a boost of oral vaccine. Under the age of 40, anyone previously receiving two injections of Salk vaccine is now given two additional doses of oral vaccine. Reinforcing doses of oral poliomyelitis vaccine are offered at school entry perioc followed by boosts for diphtheria prevention. Thirty of those previously obtaining two injections, received a third injection during th« year. It will be seen that oral vaccine has practically replaced the Salk vaccine injections. Measles Measles incidence was considerable during the year 1963. There were no deaths trc this cause. The following table shows the trend of notifications during the past ten years Year No. of Cases Deaths 1954 41 — 1955 1,329 — 1956 61 — 1957 674 1 1958 476 - 1959 674 - 1960 12 — 1961 1,042 1 1962 178 - 1963 898 - 1962 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 440 145 386 2,294 2,615 5,880 Re-vaccination 3 24 311 1,892 5,021 7,251 The figures for smallpox vaccination, after a year in which a large proportion of the population had been vaccinated, dropped heavily in 1963; the absence of public alarm about actual cases of smallpox resulted in a rapid return to apathy and neglect. Infant vaccinations, i.e. between birth and two years, numbered only 300. Contacts:— From time to time during the year contacts of suspect cases of smallpox entering or returning to the Borough are notified. The number of these during 1963 was five such persons who were notified and kept under observation. No smallpox developed. Also four persons were notified as entering from smallpox areas without valid certificates of successful vaccination. These persons were offered vaccination and kept under surveillance until they could be cleared. Typhoid Fever No cases of this disease were notified during the year. An outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Switzerland in the early part of the year, and a number of persons who were visiting from this country became infected and brought the disease back with them. Because of the presence of a number of cases in this country, it was necessary to check that no food handlers in the Borough could have been in contact, and all factory canteens, food shops, general practitioners, restaurants and water undertakings were circulated with a request for information on this subject. No food handler in Southall was found to be suspect. Scarlet Fever (Scarlatina) The number of notifications received during the year was 5, as compared with 19 in 1962, 27 in 1961 and 42 in 1960. There were no secondary cases. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria were notified to the Department. The following information supplied by the Area Medical Officer shows the number ol children immunised against diphtheria during the year. Number of Children who completed a full course of Primary Immunisation in Southall during the year Number of Children who were given Secondary or Reinforcing Injection during the year (i.e. having in a previous year received a complete full course) Ages at Date of Final Injection Under 1 l-4 5-14 Total 333 490 21 844 749 The figures for immunisation against diphtheria improved considerably during the year. It seems likely that the emphasis on smallpox vaccinations during the year of the smallpox outbreak caused the number brought for vaccination against diphtheria to be much lower that year. Even so, the 1963 figure is not up to that of the previous year, 1961, and the figure for immunisation protection when compared with the number of births is very poor. In all 984 were immunised against diphtheria in 1961 and 522 in 1962 as compared with this year's figure of 844. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No cases of onhthalmia neonatorum were notified durine the vear. 15 Tuberculosis Notifications Pulmonary The number of notifications received during the year was 76. Other Forms The number of notifications received during the year was 26. Of the total notifications, which include new cases and inward transfers from other districts, 87 were received from the Uxbridge Chest Clinic; 6 from General Hospitals; 7 from St. Bernard's Hospital; 1 from a General Practitioner, and 1 from Ealing Chest Clinic. The number of new notifications rose from 71 in 1962 to 102 in 1963. Of the 102, 37 were inward transfers, i.e. they were not resident in Southall at the time of development of the disease and, therefore, the actual figure of new notifications of Southall residents was 65; while in 1962 the number of inward transfers was 31, making the figure for new notifications of Southall residents 40, less three subsequently cancelled. Deaths Tuberculosis of the respiratory system, 3; other forms, nil. For details of new cases notified and deaths in 1963, see Appendix, Table IX, and for the occupation of new cases, see Appendix, Table X. The notification figures rose in 1963, pulmonary cases being 17 more and non-pulmonary 14 more than in the previous year. Graph C shows the progress of notifications and deaths since 1930. There were three deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with four in 1962. The amount of tuberculosis amongst Indian residents rose in 1963, comparative figures for the last seven years are:— Year New Cases Number Of Indians 1963 65 36 1962 40 12* 1961 67 29 1960 47 13 1959 64 12 1958 57 14 1957 61 10 *Two subsequently not confirmed as Tuberculosis. The analysis of the housing conditions of 86 newly notified cases shows that 56 lived in houses, 3 in flats, 27 in lodgings; information was not available with regard to the other 16 cases for the following reasons: twelve cases were notified from St. Bernard's Hospital, and four transferred out to other districts. Of the 86 cases above, twenty-five were inward transfers, i.e. had not contracted the disease in Southall. There were 8 cases living in overcrowded homes, 7 Indians and one Irish. Overcrowding was subsequently abated in all these cases. In thirteen instances there were multiple cases, four in English homes, eight in Indian homes and one in an Irish home. Statutory overcrowding was confirmed in two of these houses. The number of patients was two in ten cases, three in two cases, and four in one case. Of the eight cases of overcrowding with tuberculosis reported in 1962, five had been abated by the end of 1963, with three remaining still in overcrowded houses. All cases of overcrowding with tuberculosis found in 1961 had been abated by the end of 1963. In one instance from 1960 of dilapidated housing with tuberculosis, no rehousing had taken place by the end of the year, although Council Housing had been asked for this family. The property is to be demolished after the tenants are rehoused. 16 Graph C (Tuberculosis) All Forms - Notifications and Deaths from 1930-1963 17 Management of Tuberculosis For diagnostic purposes, Southall patients are mostly referred either by general practitioners or from hospital doctors to the Uxbridge Chest Clinic, and if tuberculosis is found, treatment and following-up is instituted from that Clinic. The Tuberculosis Visitor calls at the home of a patient and submits a copy of her report to the Public Health Department. Contacts are seen by the Visitor and they have suitable tests, either tuberculin tests or X-rays, or both, at the Chest Clinic. If sanitary defects or overcrowding are reported further visiting is carried out from the Public Health Department. At St. Bernard's Hospital, cases of tuberculosis are isolated in Adelaide Ward, which has 24 male and 24 female beds. One of the doctors from Uxbridge Chest Clinic continues to carry out tuberculin testing and B.C.G. vaccination of members of the nursing staff of the hospital. All new members of the staff at this Hospital have routine X-ray examination before commencement of duty. B.C.G. Vaccination B.C.G. vaccination is offered to contacts of cases of tuberculosis, to medical and nursing staffs of tuberculosis wards, and since 1957, as a result of the findings of the Medical Research Council in their Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial, to children aged 13 and over in Southall schools. Testing with tuberculin is carried out beforehand. The tuberculin test, if positive, shows that infection has occurred at some time during life, and further investigation is undertaken to verify whether this is active, chronic or healed infection, as these all give the same result to the test. When the tuberculin test is negative and in the absence of disease, B.C.G. inoculations are carried out in order to render the individuals tuberculin positive and. therefore, to have immunitv to infection bv the tuberculous bacillus. *Indians and Pakistanis †West Indians ‡Chinese 18 Details of work on Southall contacts during 1962 and 1963 at Uxbridge Chest Clinic are as follows:— 1962 Under 1 year l-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Grand Total Tuberculin tests—Positive result 2 2 3 5 12 269 * - 3 6 248 257 Tuberculin tests—Negative result 18 16 20 8 62 143 * 8 15 3 55 81 B.C.G. given 18 16 20 8 62 104 * 8 15 3 16 42 B.C.G. given—Babies born in hospital 17 17 •Indians and Pakistanis 1963 Under 1 year 1-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Grand Total Tuberculin tests—Positive result 4 - 2 32 381 297 * 1 3 18 203 225 † - 1 3 18 22 + + - - - 12 12 Tuberculin tests—Negative result 21 26 14 24 85 168 * 15 26 13 20 74 † 3 1 2 2 8 + - 1 - - 1 B.C.G. given 21 26 14 11 72 143 * 15 26 13 10 64 † 3 1 2 — 6 + + — 1 — — 1 B.C.G. given—Babies born in hospital 10 20 * 10 Under the B.C.G. vaccination in schools scheme, details are as follows— Number invited to take part in scheme Number of consents received Referred to Chest Clinic Number of Children vaccinated with B.C.G. Contacts Positives 816 520 10 120 273 All testing and vaccinating during 1963 under this scheme was carried out in Southall by the Middlesex County Council Staff. Mass X-ray The mobile Mass X-ray Unit paid only two routine visits to Southall factories during 1963, i.e. Associated Equipment Company Limited—number X-rayed 2,399 North Thames Gas Board Works ... —number X-rayed 292 In these surveys, one active case of pulmonary tuberculosis, and one observation case, i.e. showing signs of old disease but no symptoms, were found. No cancer cases were discovered. There is now available at the West Middlesex Hospital a static Mass X-ray Unit, the second to be introduced in Middlesex, and while primarily intended for the use of hospital patients, there is an open invitation for any member of the public to attend, at any time when the Unit is working, for a check. This is a most useful undertaking and supplements the work done during the visit of the Mobile Unit to Southall. It also saves the need, in most cases, of reference by appointment to the Chest X-ray Clinic for a large film to be taken. Dr. J. T. Nicol Roe, Chest Physician, Uxbridge Chest Clinic, reports on the need for continued aggressive action in detecting the new case of pulmonary tuberculosis, for only by so doing and treating this case effectively will the marked improvement in the control of tuberculosis in this country be maintained. The increase of new cases of pulmonary and other forms of tuberculosis experienced in Southall in 1963 has chiefly been due to the increase in Indian and Pakistani and West Indian immigrants to the Borough. Once again we must express indebtedness to the General Practitioners in Southall in continuing to refer newly arrived Indians and their families for X-rays and/or Tuberculin testing to the Chest Clinic. Appeal is made that the co-operation be stepped up to improve the anti-tuberculosis programme. Patients in the Southall area, as before, are admitted to Harefield Hospital. Dr. Nicol Roe considers it is still a desirable thing for anti-tuberculous drugs to be initiated in hospital, as a certain risk always exists towards the development of sensitivity reactions. Non-Europeans referred to the Clinic for X-ray only and skin tested.

See Appendix, Table VI, for an analysis of cancer deaths since 1936. On page 21 is set out in tabular form a classification of the cancer deaths according to the site of the primary growth and in ages. The total number of deaths from cancer in 1963 fell for the second year in succession, being 130 as compared with 138 in 1962. Cancer of the lung in males was the highest individual figure for site of disease but was lower, i.e. 35 (31 males, 4 females) compared with 36 (35 males, 1 female) in 1962, and 44 (39 males, 5 females) in the previous year, but taking the alimentary tract as a whole, the number of deaths from cancer was higher than that for cancer of the lung, i.e. 38. Distribution of Infectious Disease Notifications For the incidence of various infectious diseases notified during the year, under age groups and locality, see Appendix, Tables VII and VIII. Infectious Disease Visits During the year, the Public Health Inspectors paid 472 visits with reference to cases of infectious disease. In addition, the County Health Visitors did a certain amount of home and school visiting in connection with infectious diseases. Laboratory Work Specimens taken for bacteriological or chemical investigations, in connection particularly with infectious disease cases, are brought daily to the Manor House and transported to the Ealing Public Health Laboratory. The necessary investigations are carried out and results reported simultaneously to the Medical Officer of Health and to the doctor who has submitted the specimens from one of his patients. Details of the work carried out in 1963 are as follows:— Faeces specimens 635 Sputum specimens 1 Blood specimens 1 Urine specimens 43 Swabs (nose, throat, aural and vaginal) 11 Disinfection and Disinfestation In cases of infectious disease, rooms, clothing, etc., were disinfected—rooms by sealing and fumigating with a formalin preparation; clothing, bedding and other infected articles remaining in the room for disinfection. 20 List of premises, article etc., disinfected during the year:- Rooms 13 Books 28 Beds 9 Eiderdowns 8 Blankets 24 Pillows 14 Sheets 24 List of premises disinfested from vermin during the year:— Bug infestation 21 rooms with beds and bedding Flea infestation 23 rooms with beds and bedding Cockroach infestation 31 rooms Lice 6 rooms Carpet beetles 9 rooms Ants 5 rooms Spider beetles 3 rooms In addition, 5 wasps nests were destroyed. 21 CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER DEATHS IN SITES AND AGES Age Groups—Male Site Total Under 10 10—20 20—30 30-40 40—50 50-60 60—70 70—80 804- '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '32 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '32 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 ''61 '62 '63 Lung 31 28 39 35 31 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 3 3 4 1 15 1 6 8 9 8 9 20 14 14 7 5 0 9 6 - - - - 1 Stomach 13 9 13 5 8 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 1 2 2 4 5 3 2 1 2 5 5 8 2 1 - - 1 - 1 Intestine 6 7 6 7 11 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - - 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 6 - - 2 1 1 1 2 - 1 1 Bladder 5 - 3 7 4 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 - - 1 1 2 - 2 3 1 1 - 1 3 2 - - - - - Prostate 2 6 9 4 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 2 - 1 - 2 2 2 - 1 2 3 1 3 1 1 2 1 1 Other 8 20 19 17 17 - - - 1 - - - 1 1 2 - - - - - - 2 - 1 2 2 3 1 2 5 2 5 6 4 1 3 7 4 7 1 - 1 4 - 5 1 2 3 1 1 Totals 65 70 89 75 76 - - - 1 - - - 1 1 2 - - - - - - 2 - 1 2 4 7 4 6 7 24 9 17 17 18 20 24 33 30 24 14 13 28 16 18 3 5 6 3 5 Age Groups—Female Site Total Under 10 10—20 20—30 30—40 40-50 50-60 60-70 70-80 80 + '59 60 61 '62 63 '59 '60 •61 '62 '63 '59' 60' '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 '59 '60 '61 '62 '63 Breast 5 8 15 13 11 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - 2 2 3 2 1 5 6 7 3 2 - 3 2 1 - - 1 2 2 2 1 3 3 2 Lung 5 3 5 1 4 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 - 1 1 - 1 - - - - - - 2 Stomach 9 6 8 12 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 4 1 2 2 1 6 1 4 - 3 1 1 Uterus 2 3 4 3 3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 1 - 1 - 1 - - - 2 - 1 3 2 - - - - 1 _ 1 Intestine 11 9 8 11 10 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 1 - - 1 2 1 5 3 3 2 6 2 5 4 2 - 2 3 - 1 3 1 Bladder 1 - 3 3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - 1 - - 2 - - - 2 - - Other 17 19 16 20 21 - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 - - - - 2 3 1 - - - 6 2 1 4 2 4 5 3 7 10 2 7 6 4 4 1 4 5 5 2 Totals 50 48 59 63 54 - - 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - 1 - - 1 1 3 4 4 3 5 3 9 10 13 9 14 14 13 13 22 15 12 6 13 14 9 10 5 15 12 9 Smallpox Disinfection In the event of smallpox occurring within the district and disinfection being required on a considerable scale, arrangements have been made whereby this could be carried out. An agreement was made with the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board whereby in such an event the stalf of St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, would carry out this work. Provision of Antitoxin and Vaccine Lymph The Council provides diphtheria antitoxin free to local practitioners in the district. This antitoxin is obtainable from the Public Health Department during office hours and by direct request to the Medical Officer of Health at other times. In the event of emergency supplies of vaccine lymph being required, they are obtainable at very short notice. Scabies and Lice During 1963, twenty-eight cases of scabies and contacts were brought to the notice of the Department. Cleansing for head lice was needed for one family, but on two different occasions, making 13 individuals requiring cleansing station treatment. There was also one case of pediculosis pubis. Baths and treatment were arranged at Hammersmith Cleansing Station by courtesy of Hammersmith Borough Council. The results of the routine school surveys in cleanliness was not good; the number inspected was very little greater than in 1962. The number requiring treatment was almost as high (only one less) than in that year and was three times as great as in 1961, and compulsory cleansing was needed for an increased number. Treatment of school children is normally carried out by private practitioners or in the ordinary Middlesex County Council Clinics, but on failure of treatment, or in cases of bad infestation, the Borough Council facilities are requested. Details of head inspections in schools are to be found in Table XI, page 66. 22 WELFARE General St. John Ambulance Association: The local headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Association are situated at Harrington Road, Southall. There are 21 Nursing Members, 4 Officers, 2 N.C.O.'s (Nursing) and 9 Auxiliary Members. The work carried out is as follows:— Home Nursing and Nursing Equipment. The St. John Ambulance Nursing Division has been trained in Home Nursing and First Aid to the Injured. It also lends nursing equipment for use in the home from the Medical Comforts Depot in Hartington Road, open every evening (except Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays) from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. for the issue of articles needed by the public. During the year 267 articles were lent under the scheme—the 1962 figure was 292. Ten members belong to the National Hospital Service Reserve. Welfare—General. The St. John Ambulance Brigade carried out trainings in First Aid and Home Nursing for all who cared to take advantage of the service, also special courses for Civil Defence volunteers and for Scouts and Guides. The members of the Nursing and Ambulance Divisions carried out many other duties including attendance at local cinemas, sports, fairs, Old Folks' Clubs, accompanying old people's group excursions to the seaside, hospital duties, also sick visiting. Members also took part in duties further afield, including London Airport, London theatres, concerts, etc. The amount of voluntary time given to this good work is considerable. During 1963, 1,128 hours were spent on public duties, 242 on miscellaneous duties, 229 on duty at Old Peoples' Clubs and 133 on duty in Hospital Wards. British Red Cross Society: Membership of the Southall Division of the British Red Cross Society increased in 1963 to 347, mainly due to the large number of cadets, and link members who can join from the age of eight years. The older girls help in hospitals each week and have started to visit the deaf-blind in order to communicate with such people by a special finger language which they have learnt. Courses in first-aid, nursing and maternity and child welfare were well attended and the Junior Red Cross also attended mothercraft, nursing and first-aid lectures and examinations. Several Indian girls joined the Cadet Units and came regularly to the meetings. The Handicraft Club for the Disabled increased its membership again. Thirty-five members attended the meetings each week in 1963. There were various outings during the year. Other activities of the local Red Cross included escort duties, medical loan depot, visiting, all clerical work connected with, and attendance at, Blood Donor sessions, emergency help for disabled ex-Servicemen, the almoning of grants from various organisations and charities, first-aid duties at the local Rugby Football ground, the Royal Festival Hall and school functions, and assistance as "casualties" and "casualty fakers" at the Civil Defence exercises at the Hayes training ground. A valuable section of the Division, apart from the uniformed V.A.D. members, is that of the ordinary members, who help in many ways, other than medical or training ones. They undertake regular escort duties, money-raising activities, and help with the Handicraft Club for the Disabled each week. The Physically Disabled Peoples' League—Southall Branch: A new club for disabled old age pensioners was started in the Spring of 1963. The membership grew rapidly and amounted to 105 by the end of the year. Transport was arranged for the members and a specially constructed coach with lifting arrangements 23 provided by Middlesex County Council. The Group meets once a month at St. George's Hall and tea and entertainment are provided. The Hard of Hearing Club: This Club had a successful year in 1963 and continued to be popular and useful to its members, also many persons not actually members of the Club were given help with their hearing aid difficulties. The membership figure rose slightly and there was an average weekly attendance of 40. The officers and committee have been exceedingly busy, and the programmes continued to be educational, entertaining and also helpful to the members in their endeavour to overcome and live with their disability. Five members attended the Old Age Pensioners' Holiday at Dymchurch, organised by the Welfare Committee of the Middlesex and Surrey League, and the group was represented at the National Conferences of the British Association for the Hard of Hearing. An important addition to the Group has been the inauguration of a transport service to convey some of the elderly members who are incapacitated besides being hard of hearing, to the weekly meetings. The cost of this has been borne by the League and the Group, but at the same time a small charge (i.e. normal bus fares) is made to the members. This has proved a great help to those using the transport; at the same time enabling the members to attend more regularly. Diabetic Club: The Southall and District Diabetic Club, a Branch of the British Diabetic Association, continued to function throughout 1963. This Club, formed in 1956, aims to enable diabetics, their relatives and friends, and those interested in diabetic welfare, to meet together socially to have more general discussions, and to hear authoritative talks from speakers who specialise or are particularly interested in diabetes such as doctors and other health and nutrition experts. Membership by subscription was 73, with a Club Newsletter circulation of 107. The attendance at monthly meetings in the Masons Room of the Holy Trinity Hall averaged 28. The Club has a Committee of 10 members which includes three welfare officers and organisers of various fund-raising activities in aid of the Research Fund of the British Diabetic Association. The Club programme in 1963 included talks by diabetic chocolate manufacturers, food demonstrations, social evenings, Road Safety films, three specialised talks by doctors, a theatre outing, a coach trip to the sea, and a Christmas Party. In October, the Southall Branch opened a new club in Hounslow, and 18 new members were enrolled following a Newsletter circulation of 40. The prospects of this club in 1964 are excellent, and as the clubs are to be run on a joint basis, it will greatly expand the Southall Branch. The Club is a member of the North-West Metropolitan Region which consists of 7 Branches in West London, and inter-club visits are organised. Multiple Sclerosis Society: The West London Branch of the Multiple Sclerosis Society has four Southall members, and six are attached to the new West Middlesex Branch of the same Society. The Branches arranged social events with transport, and there is much individual help, visiting and advice given to each member. Meetings are held at St. Paul's Hall, South Ealing, and St. Mary's Hall Bedfont. Swimming is arranged every Saturday at Hounslow Baths; telephone installation and help with provision of clothing or other needs were arranged for individual patients, and in 1963 the West Middlesex Branch was given a Therapeutic Machine to loan to members for muscle training, this branch also lends wheelchairs and is collecting money for its own Ambulance. Spas tics Welfare Society: The Central Middlesex Spastics Welfare Society is a voluntary organisation, having as its primary object the intention of helping as many Spastics as possible within the Borough of Southall and surrounding Boroughs to lead fuller and happier lives. 24 At its Training and Work Centre at Ruislip, 30 Spastics attend daily where they are engaged on light engineering, assembly, printing and other suitable sub-contract work for local firms. A Social Club meets monthly at Perivale, various coach and other outings are arranged and financial help given in cases of extreme hardship. Advice and help is given in providing improved medical and educational facilities. Some of the Spastics who have had training and experience at the Work Centre have gained sufficient confidence to obtain outside employment; others more severely handicapped have been provided with work at home. Charitable appeals for money are constantly made to ensure the continuation of the Society's work and efforts are being made to secure larger and more permanent premises so that those Spastics who are at present virtually housebound can also be brought to the Society's Training and Work Centre. Women's Voluntary Service: The Women's Voluntary Service is very active in Southall, and amongst the many services given by its members the following are particularly connected with Welfare:— Clerical work in all three clincs in Southall; provision of a Trolley Shop in both Southall-Norwood and Mount Pleasant Hospitals; issue of batteries for deaf aids in Southall Hospital; making out-patients' teas on Clinic days in Southall Hospital; taking the telephone trolley round Southall Hospital for patients' use; help in the X-ray department with the filing at Southall Hospital; issue of Welfare Foods from W.V.S. Office. Welfare of the Blind and Partially Sighted: The Welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted are the responsibility of the County Council under the National Assistance Act, 1948. In 1963, there were resident in the Borough 88 blind and 19 partially-sighted persons. There were 3 partially-sighted children attending Special Schools. Eleven blind persons were in full-time employment. Of these, one was in a Workshop for the Blind, and one was working as a Home Worker. The earnings of these two persons were augmented by the County Council. The County Council's Welfare Department provides a Home Teaching service, the object of which is to enable blind and partially-sighted people to lead full and active lives by assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities. The majority of blind persons are either not able to take employment owing to age or infirmity, or for some reason are not available for employment. Amongst the latter are housewives who may receive instruction from the Home Teachers in carrying out their household duties in their own homes or in special classes or in residential courses of social rehabilitation. The Home Teachers visit all blind and partially-sighted persons in their own homes, in hospitals and in residential homes, advise on all problems relating to their welfare and keep them in touch with available social services. They give instruction in Braille and Moon systems of embossed type, and in handicrafts. Deaf-Blind persons also receive the services of a special Home Teacher for the Deaf-Blind. A handicraft class is held fortnightly at the King's Hall Methodist Church, South Road, Southall. Close co-operation is maintained between the County Council and Voluntary Organisations, including the Social Club for the Blind, which holds fortnightly meetings at the Labour Hall, The Broadway, Southall, and the Middlesex Association for the Blind, which assists individual necessitous blind people and maintains a holiday home at Littlehampton, two holiday caravans at Lancing, and two Residential Homes for the Blind. The Southall Blind Club has a membership of 34 with an average age of 73, and transport to Club meetings is carried out by members of Southall Round Table and Inner Wheel. The Club is social and in 1963 also ran two coach outings and a Christmas party. Blind persons are eligible for the loan of a wireless receiver through the British "Wireless for the Blind" Fund, and the County Council has a scheme for assisting blind and partially-sighted persons with the maintenance of wireless sets 25 Other services are provided by the County Council either directly or through a registered agency and these include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handicraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handicrafts and assisted holidays for those in need. Welfare of Handicapped Persons other than Blind: Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially-sighted which are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948, provide welfare services for the deaf and dumb and hard-of-hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by disease, injury or congenital deformity. Services to the deaf-and-dumb and the hard-of-hearing are provided by appropriate Voluntary Organisations, to which the County Council makes grants in aid. For statutory Welfare purposes, until November, 1963, the Borough of Southall formed part of Area 9, of Middlesex County Council which includes also the Boroughs of Brentford and Chiswick, and Heston and Isleworth. From November, 1963, it has formed part of Area 7, which includes also the Boroughs of Acton and Ealing. Four Social Workers and an Industrial Work Organiser are included in the staff which has been provided by the County Council's Welfare Department for carrying out social services required, and who visit those suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps. They work from the Local Area Welfare Office and the handicapped persons are visited in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain services from statutory or voluntary sources. The County Council supplies aids and appliances not covered by the National Health Service and carries out where necessary adaptations to a house to enable a handicapped person to become more mobile, provides holidays, arranges for the disabled to take part in social activities, including choral and dancing classes, attend handicraft classes, etc. Special coaches with a hydraulic hoist to lift wheelchair cases are available for use for social activities, etc. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given and membership of voluntary organisations catering for particular handicaps is facilitated. The Industrial Work Organiser endeavours to procure from industry appropriate assembly work and arranges for this to be carried out by handicapped persons at a Work Centre or in their own homes where this is considered to be suitable and of assistance to the individuals concerned. At 31st December, 1963, 88 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped. Alterations to seven houses to make them more suitable for handicapped persons were made as follows:— Flat: Rail at back door to assist over steps. House: Wooden raised toilet seat to outside toilet and rails on wall. Flat: During building, an extra doorway between the kitchen and living room was provided, other doorways widened, the sink put at the right height, a bath substituted with recessed handles similar to those used in old people's dwellings and ramps made to the front and back doors. Flat: Wooden ramps and platform at front door. Flat: Pavement crossover and concrete base for invalid carriage shed. House: Handrail on wall above bath. House: Ramp from french window into garden. Under the County provision of Chiropody Service, several physically handicapped persons received domiciliary chiropody treatment in 1963. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, Mr. D. C.

It will will be noted that three of these problem cases would be able to continue to live at home and in better health if suitable ground floor housing could be obtained for them. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them; and it can do this by providing its own homes or by arrangements with recognised voluntary organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department administers the County homes, and the number of persons admitted to such homes from the Borough in 1963 was 15, one of whom had been previously brought to our attention in 1962, and one during 1963. Ten old persons were transferred from St. Bernard's Hospital to County accommodation in Old People's Homes. There are still six cases waiting from previous years, three from 1961 and three from 1962, who were in poor health and in need of old peoples' housing. It has been ascertained from the Area Medical Officer that 438 Southall people were given home help during the year, and of these 355 consisted of chronic sick or aged persons, and of 914 persons who were assisted by the home nurses, 332 were of age 65 or over, 111 male and 221 female. Many voluntary associations contributed to provide Christmas parcels or special comforts for old people. Meals on Wheels Service: During the year mid-day meals on four days per week were provided for house-bound old people in need of the service. In 1963, 16,456 meals were delivered (16,506 in 1962). Two hundred and thirty-one old persons were assisted by means of this scheme during the year. This was a bigger number of individual people helped; 33 more in fact, the reason for this being that more short-term, or holiday period, help was given from the meals service. The maximum number of old people receiving the meals on any one day was 92, so that both 28 vans were working to capacity on many occasions. Special Christmas dinners (frozen packs) were delivered to 96 people and also to them went 96 special parcels to cover the Christmas period when meals were not being delivered; also 12 special parcels for diabetic persons or other invalids requiring special nutrition. During the long hard winter, deliveries of tinned soup, milk puddings and milk drinks were also made. Chiropody Service for Old People: This service was continued throughout 1963. Five local chiropodists gave their services at cheap rates for Old Age Pensioners. In 1962, Middlesex County Officers were empowered to proceed with a scheme for the increase in the provision of chiropody as part of the County Health Services and 99 old age pensioners had attention during the year at the Northcote Avenue Clinic, the number of attendances by them at the Clinic being 517. The County Council was able also to offer financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing chiropody, and the Southall Old People's Welfare Committee reported the number of treatments given during the year under this scheme to be 1,741 (1,222 in 1962), i.e. treatments at surgeries 837, and visits to homebound 904. The number of Old Age Pensioners receiving treatment under this scheme was 417. The County Council made provision for a limited amount of domiciliary service from 26th October, 1962. One Old Age Pensioner was given 8 treatments under this provision. Holidays for Old People: The holiday scheme whereby old people get a seaside holiday during off-season months of May and September, at reduced rates, continued during 1963 and was operated by the various Old People's Clubs in the Borough. In addition, the Southall Old People's Welfare Association arranged holidays for 30 housebound and semi-invalid elderly. In addition, 40 had transport for a day's outing to the sea—all meals arranged; 81 had transport to Annual Luncheon; 71 had transport to Ice Show; 74 had transport to Carol Services; 76 had transport to Southend Illuminations—high tea arranged at Southend; and 146 had transport to Concerts, parties, etc. during the year. Clubs for Old People: Old Age Pensioners Federation—Southall Branch: This Club had a membership of 150 and met once a week on Monday afternoons for social purposes, the average attendance being about 125. Seaside outings were arranged during the summer, and a party and concert at Christmas. St. Anselm's "Over Sixties" Club: This Club increased its membership in 1963. Approximately 200 members were on the register in 1963 with an average attendance of 150 at each Tuesday meeting. The Club continued to be a most popular rendezvous on Tuesday afternoons with members of all denominations although maintained by the Southall Section of the Catholic Women's League. During the year there were four free outings to the seaside, a visit to a pantomime, and a Christmas party. Entertainment was provided each week, birthdays were celebrated with a card and small gift, and sick members were visited. The Silverthreads Group: This Club had a membership of 170, meeting once a week on Thursdays at the Community Centre, with an average attendance of 96. The Club is a social one, and entertainment was provided for the members each week. There were three coach outings, a birthday party, a Christmas party and a harvest festival also arranged. The Darby and Joan Club: This Club met weekly and had a membership in 1963 of 79, with an average attendance at each meeting of about 60. The meetings were social, entertainment being provided and refreshments. A Summer outing, a free luncheon, and a Christmas party, including a monetary gift for each member, were arranged. 29 The Allenby Old Age Pensioners Club: This Club met weekly on Wednesdays, had a membership of 152, with an average attendance of over 100. The Club is social, and entertainment and refreshments were provided at each meeting. Five seaside outings were arranged by this Club, the organiser of which takes a special pride in the fact that the Club is entirely self-supporting, and that a small orchestra has been formed by members of the Club. The United Old Folks Club: The average attendance at this Club was 170-200. Meetings were once a week on Mondays and these were social with entertainment provided. The members had several free outings to the seaside, including one special visit to the country for the elderly housebound. At each free outing, a gift of five shillings was given to each member, and on one occasion, a High Tea was provided. There was also an Easter Gift of five shillings to every member, and during the year two evening outings were arranged to Twickenham and district, where an entertainment was given and refreshments provided. A Christmas party, including a gift for each member of ten shillings, Christmas parcels and gifts for the sick were also provided from this Club, and a free pantomime outing attended by 160 members. St. John's Church Old Folks Club: This is a social Club, having 61 members and providing entertainments and outings. The average attendance at the weekly meetings was 45. Other Services: A service for the provision of cheap laundry and a cheap boot and shoe service are available for Old Age Pensioners. The North Thames Gas Board offers a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of Old Age Pensioners living alone. The reason for this is to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer includes, if the financial circumstances warrant this, free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. To take advantage of this offer, lists of old people living alone are submitted from the Public Health Department and in due course the homes of the persons nominated on the lists are visited by the Gas Board Officers. Fresh lists continued to be supplied from time to time. A visiting library service for old people who were housebound was started early in 1959—operated by the Southall Old People's Welfare Committee, and with distribution assisted by various young people's groups. This has proved to be a very successful scheme, not only because the elderly obtain reading material without effort, but because the voluntary visitors, who include young people from the Girl Guides, give pleasure by their interest in the old people, and even during the worst weather of 1963 the library van did not fail in its weekly visits. Southall Association for the Occupation of the Elderly: The Work Centre for the Elderly situated in the Municipal Sports Ground, and maintained by a voluntary association supported in part by Middlesex County Council and Southall Borough Council, continued to operate throughout 1963. The number working there at the end of the year was 45. A second Centre in Featherstone Terrace was built in 1963 and opened at the end of the year with 12 workers. Various types of work were carried out, carding buttons, trimming and stamping of metals bolts, trimming of rubber, sorting of porcelain fittings, etc. Any Old Age Pensioner was eligible to apply for work under this scheme and once taken on was kept on whether his or her output could be considered significant or not. Payment was made at the rate of 1/- per hour with bonuses at holiday periods. Cups of tea were provided for the workers, and excursions, visits, and a Christmas party were arranged for them by the Organisers. National Assistance Act, 1948, section 47: National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951: No case was dealt with under these powers during 1963. 30 HEALTH EDUCATION Subjects of Health Education which were topical during the year were the importance of vaccination against smallpox; the connection between smoking and bronchitis and lung cancer; the need for constant attention to personal hygiene, and for the inculcation of good sanitary habits amongst children, who in time can educate their parents and relations. When the newspapers reported cases of smallpox in the Country, there was an immediate rush by those who had ignored or even rejected all offers of vaccination in the past, and a demand for mass vaccination. Fear, as ever, caused unreason in the population, but in Southall, with a tradition of trust in the officers of the Health Department, it was possible to satisfy those needing vaccination that there would be time enough to make them safe. The private practioners were given as much help as possible—supplies of vaccine were brought from the Central Laboratory by Health Department staff every day, and quietly and slowly a large proportion of the population was made immune—the County also arranged a few extra clinic sessions for vaccination of adults in addition to normal infant vaccination. There was an intensive campaign by the central authorities in order to educate the public on the dangers of smoking. Free publicity material was provided in great quantity, large posters for public notice boards, a special issue for display in the surgeries of general practitioners, who had signified willingness through their Executive Councils to display the posters. Clinics and schools were issued with posters and leaflets from Middlesex County Council. Although the dysentery outbreak had been largely overcome by the beginning of the year, it gave the opportunity for persistent publicity on the need for hand washing before handling food, and the attention of the school managers, and the owners of restaurants, food shops and factories had their attention drawn to the need for the desirability of washing facilities of the most suitable character and in the most suitable position for the public to be able to do what they were being asked to do and wash their hands frequently. A Seminar was held by the Central Council for Health Education in February. The subject was on "New Horizons in Health Education", but really the Seminar was devoted more to new methods of health education than to new subjects, as the old lessons on the rules of healthy living are so poorly understood and so little obeyed; the simple rules of exercise, nutrition, sleep and cleanliness, should be known well enough after the years and years of health education in homes, in schools, in factories, in shops, in restaurants, yet how little they are obeyed, particularly cleanliness—the Scandinavians and the Americans, who used only to object to English plumbing, now object to the dirty food shops and kitchens, and the methods of food handling in this country, and look at our litter-lined streets with amazement and disgust. There was general agreement that television was a more powerful factor now than any other in getting the messages of health education through to the public, and already in certain parts of the country closed circuit television was being used successfully by Public Health Departments. 31 HOME SAFETY The number who died as a result of accident other than motor vehicle accident was increased over that for the previous year—21 in 1963 and 14 in 1962. Twelve of the accidental deaths were the result of accident in the home, six happened in hospital, one on the railway, and two were found drowned. Cause of Death Age Sex Fall from window 79 M Found dead on railway line 21 M Inhaled carbon monoxide (domestic gas) 85 M Fell downstairs 75 M Fell at home 80 M Fell at home 91 M Inhaled carbon monoxide (domestic gas) 56 M Inhaled carbon monoxide (domestic gas) 58 M Inhaled carbon monoxide (fumes from solid fuel boiler) 63 M Alcoholic poisoning 40 M Cholecystectomy for gall stones 68 M Asphyxia due to drowning 8 F Asphyxia due to drowning 63 F Fell in hospital 89 F Fell in hospital 83 F Sat in bath of hot water 71 F Fell in hospital 66 F Fell at home 80 F Inhaled carbon monoxide (domestic gas) 76 F Inhalation of vomit 36 F Shock due to house burning down 73 F There were 8 suicides, 1 more than in 1962; 4 swallowed drugs; 1 was found hanged, and 2 died from gas poisoning, and 1 from a self-inflicted wound. The ages of these varied from 30 to 61. Education on safety in the home was much more extensive in 1963, and more action was taken nationally as well as locally on the improvement of house design, furnishing design, kitchen equipment design for safety. The new watchdogs for safety, the Consumer's Council, are reinforcing the work done in the past only by Voluntary Women's Societies to help the Medical Officer in the fight against shoddy, cheap, dangerous products, and during the year the need for legislation with regard to the sale of children's nightwear, which was easy to set alight, became a matter of immediate importance, with the prospect of obtaining a ban on such sale. It will be seen from the table above that the great majority of accidental deaths occurred in people over the age of 60, the principle causes being falls or gas poisoning, so that much work still needs to be done on the safety of homes. Too many houses in which elderly people live are not provided with safety taps for gas cookers, or hand rails to assist the occupants in getting from room to room. The figure for deaths from home accidents, of course, is a very small indication of the number of accidents that occur in homes, and many of the persons sustaining accidents at home and recovering after treatment in hospital are disabled in some respect for the rest of their lives. Faulty electrical wiring, absence of fireguards, worn carpets and linoleum, amateur alterations to gas and electric fittings, poison bottles and containers of insecticides and weed killers, are unsuitably labelled and only too ready to the hands of children and even of older persons groping carelessly in dark cupboards or on shelves, and these matters have, unfortunately, to be pointed out day after day in individual houses, and generally to the public by all the health education methods, press publicity, poster publicity, radio and television. 32 ROAD SAFETY Four persons (3 adults, 1 child) were killed in street accidents in Southall during 1963 The figure was three in 1962. Details are as follows:— Persons Killed Type of Road User Cause of Accident Age Sex Pedal Cyclist Swerving cyclist struck by car 11 M Light goods vehicle driver Crushed between two lorries 21 M Motor Cyclist Collision with Public Service Vehicle turning corner 18 M Pedestrian Fell in front of Public Service Vehicle after stumbling 45 F Summary Persons killed 3 Adults 1 Child Persons injured: Serious 69 Adults 16 Children Slight 332 Adults 52 Children 401 Adults 68 Children This was a bad year for motor vehicle accidents in Southall. The total of persons killed or injured was higher by 62 than in 1962, and an 11 year old boy was killed; and the number of children injured was up from 63 in 1962 to 68 in 1963. None of the four persons dying as a result of motor accidents in Southall were Southall residents but nine Southall residents died as a result of road accidents occurring outside of the Borough. 33 Persons Injured Adult Serious Slight School Age Serious Slight Under 5 Serious Slight Pedestrians 8 38 7 24 3 8 Total 46 Total 31 Total 11 Pedal Cyclists 8 57 6 14 - - Total 65 Total 20 Motor-assisted Cyclists 1 9 — — — - Total 10 Private motor-car drivers 10 48 — — — - Total 58 Light goods vehicle drivers 2 10 — — — - Total 12 Heavy goods vehicle drivers — 2 — — — - Total2 Private motor car passengers 13 56 — 4 — 1 Total 69 Total 4 Total 1 Public Service Vehicle passengers 1 15 1 Total 16 Total 1 Light goods vehicle passengers 1 11 — - - - Total 12 Motor Cyclists 18 43 — — — - Total 61 Scooter Riders 2 28 - - - - Total 30 Drivers of other vehicles - 3 - - - - Total 3 Passengers in/on other vehicles 5 12 - — — - Total 17 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply and Water Services Water is supplied to nearly the whole of the district by the South-West Suburban Water Company. The Metropolitan Water Board supplies a small area in the southern part of the district, and the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company a small area in the northern part. The supply is satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. Reports on sampling carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. All inhabited houses are supplied from public water mains and there are no stand-pipes in use on mains. Under Section 35, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, provision is made for immediate action to be taken by the Local Authority to restore a water supply which has been cut off for some default. Sewerage Middlesex County Council provides the facilities for purification of sewage from tho Borough at the Mogden Sewage Works. The amount of congestion occurring in the drains and sewers of the Borough, partly as a result of increase in the number of houses and shops, partly due to the fact that improved knowledge of hygiene results in an increased use of water for cleanliness, meant that problems arose of overcharging of sewers, and of flooding during periods of heavy rain. Measures to relieve this had to be taken, and the latest position with regard to these improvements is as follows:— An additional length of surface water sewer was installed in part of Dormers Wells Lane, further reducing the risk of flooding in this road. This with the provision of a new Southern Soil Relief Sewer completed in 1962 has made the possibility of flooding small in the Borough. The only pail closets emptied by the Council are two at "Springdale". There are two cesspools emptied by the Council's gully emptier—one at "Springdale" and one at Wyke Green. Refuse Collection and Disposal Southall Borough Council provides one dustbin free to every separately rated hereditament, the number of bins so supplied is approximately 17,000. The renewal period for these is when the dustbins have worn out, but not more frequently than once in ten years. Weekly collections are made from houses; three times a week from St. Bernard's Hospital; twiceweekly collections are made from other Hospitals and high flats. Weekly collections from shops and industrial premises are generally made, sometimes more frequently. Large amounts are charged for. Special collections from domestic and other premises are made by arrangement. The Council maintain a fleet of vehicles, including 8 freighters on refuse collection, one lorry for special collections. Refuse is picked over for salvage in the Council Depot, salvaged materials being sold, and the residue is either incinerated at the Depot or carried to be tipped at an authorised site at West Drayton. Street Cleansing The main shopping streets are cleansed daily and other roads are cleansed once, twice or three times a week depending on various conditions. For this purpose, one lorry, and one mechanical sweeper-collector are used. There are 14 street orderlies with hand trucks. Sweepings are conveyed to the Depot and subsequently to the tip at West Drayton. In addition, one gully-emptying machine is used to cleanse the street gullies, which number approximately 3,250 in the Borough; each gully being cleansed four times a year. The refuse is tipped at the Council Depot and then carted to West Drayton. 34 Public Conveniences Five public conveniences are maintained by the Borough Council in the Borough in addition to those provided in the public parks. These are sited at the Town Hall, High Street; The Green (Manor House Grounds); Jubilee Gardens; King George's Field, Lady Margaret Road; and Norwood Green. Each convenience provides accommodation for both sexes. No charge is made for the use of the facilities, attendance is provided to some extent, and free washing facilities are available, but a small charge is made for linen towels. For details of use of towels see page 40. In addition, the public conveniences in the public parks are as follows: Cranleigh Playpark; Municipal Sports Ground, in pavilion; Southall Park (these were increased in number during 1963 by means of renovation plus new building); Recreation Ground, in ground, pavilion and Swimming Bath; Wolf Fields, in pavilion; Hortus Cemetery; and Havelock Cemetery. Sanitary Inspection of the District The total number of inspections of premises made during the year by the Public Health Inspectors was 9,939. Table XI1 gives an analysis of the number and nature of such inspections. The total number of inspections rose by over one thousand visits. There was a very heavy increase in the number of visits made for houses in multiple occupation because of the continuing changes of policy on standards for this type of dwelling. In other Boroughs, this problem is of old standing, but as it is a comparatively new feature of Southall life, great efforts are being made to see that the dwellings are brought up to the standards permitted by contemporary legislation. Another high figure is for visits in connection with the Clean Air Act and the implementation of further Smoke Control Areas. During the year, request was made from the Minister of Health that the Clean Air Act programme should be accelerated, so the work in connection with this matter was increased as much as was possible considering the other commitments of the Inspectors and the need for emergency inspections which always require immediate attention from the Inspector of the appropriate district. The amount of inspection on hygiene of food in shops and food factories increased, and there was a considerable number of visits required for the following-up and clearing of the finish of the Sonne dysentery outbreak. Visits to school premises showed also a higher figure because of the difficulties occurring during the great frost, in the early part of the year, which resulted in considerable damage to sanitary facilities in the schools. Market There is a market, part open, part covered, in the High Street where a weekly horse and cattle sale is held on Wednesdays and a general sale of market produce and goods is held on Saturdays. Observation requires to be kept on the hygienic provisions and maintenance there. In addition, travelling fairs and circuses spend periods in the Borough, three to four times a year, and require supervision. School Sanitation, Ventilation and Lighting Schemes for the improvement of sanitary conditions in Southall schools made little progress during the year. In the beginning of the year, sudden severe weather resulted in the complete freezing-up of the outdoor waterclosets which still existed in many schools, and also in some of the indoor waterclosets and washing facilities. Conditions were so bad that at one point in January, it seemed as if some schools would have to close, but various temporary arrangements and the obtaining of extra plumbing services by the action of this Department secured 35 The following tables give details of the work done in connection with the factories and outworkers in the Borough:— Inspections Factory Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 9 7 - - (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 170 177 - - (3) Other Premises in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority (excluding outworkers' premises) - - - - Totals 179 184 — — 36 enough relief for all the schools to be able to remain open. Urgent protests were made to the County Council and promises that suitable heating and lagging of pipes in order to prevent a similar disaster were made, but at the end of the year very little work had been carried out. The Borough Council provides the number of dustbins required for the removal of school refuse. Eradication of Bed Bugs, Fleas and Lice Statistics for the year:— (a) Number of Council houses (1) found to be infested 5 (2) disinfested during the year 5 (b) Number of other houses Total 12 (1) found to be infested 7 (2) disinfested during the year 7 Canal Boats Southall is not a registration authority for canal boats. Inspections are carried out in the Boroughs having mooring depots for these boats as a routine procedure and only rarely is there need for interference by any officer of Southall. No report was necessary during 1963. Mortuary and Post-Mortem Room The mortuary, situated in Havelock Road, provides adequate accommodation for the Borough, but it is not likely to be used for mortuary purposes again, as all bodies from this Borough are now deposited at the Acton and Uxbridge Mortuaries, and the Council makes an annual contribution to the two local authorities concerned. No bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year. Thirty-five bodies were deposited in the mortuary at Acton and ninety bodies in the mortuary at Uxbridge, for post-mortem purposes and coroner's inquest if necessary.

Eighty-three houses were given to be included in the first provisional programme of slum clearance in 1955, and a further 72 in 1961. Fifty-eight houses have been demolished or closed since the 1st January, 1956. Numbers 3 and 4, Park View Road, although not demolished, were not used for human habitation, and Numbers 1-14, Buckingham Terrace and 1-3, Clear View Cottages, and 82 and 90, High Street, although represesented in 1962, were still not dealt with by the end of 1963 because of the requirement for rehousing of the occupants. During the year, Closing Orders were made on Brookside House, Hayes Bridge; 43, Featherstone Road; 53, Hammond Road, and 65, Hammond Road, the latter three are not on the slum clearance programme. No slum properties were demolished during the year. Improvement Grants (Housing Act, 1949, as amended bv the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958) Thirty-one applications were approved for grant for property improvement. In all, up to the end of 1963, 177 of these Improvement Grants have been approved. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) During the year, 10 applications were received and approved. No certificates of revocation of disrepair certificates were approved. Overcrowding More visits were required in 1963 to be paid for estimation of overcrowding and sixteen cases of new overcrowding were confirmed. Eleven cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. The number remaining on the Department's register of overcrowding at the end of the year was 43 dwellings, which is an increase of five on last year's figure. For further details see Table XIII, page 68. Re-Housing of Applicants for Council Dwellings Council Housing within the Borough The number of families obtaining Council accommodation for the first time in 1963 was 59. Nine old persons were rehoused from the waiting list and fifteen were transferred from larger Council properties, to smaller accommodation. One one-bedroom flat and seven bed-sittingroom flats in Hill House, Allenby Road, were completed and occupied during the year. New Town Housing The total number of families removing to New or Expanded Towns: 25 families nominated under the Industrial Selection Scheme up to April, 1956 (since when the Council has had to pay subsidy for every family moving from this Borough to New or Expanded Towns); in addition, 50 families who had found their own accommodation in one of the New Towns were subsequently accepted as Council nominees; the total number of families who have moved to New or Expanded Towns since that date is a further 321, twenty-five families having been rehoused in this way during 1963. Modernisation of Council Houses There were 426 houses, built between 1930 and 1936, which still had old ranges with hot water supply, except where the tenants themselves installed modern fireplaces. A total of 358 have now been modernised up to the 31st December, 1963. Bathrooms were provided and new grates and electrical power points were installed in eleven old persons' bungalows in Saxon Gardens. Bathrooms, modern grates and electrical power points were provided in four purchased houses; three in Beaconsfield Road and one in Woodlands Road. 38 Houses in Multiple Occupation At the end of the year, 688 houses had been ascertained to be let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. In 13 further cases where excessive numbers of persons were being accommodated, Notices under Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1957, were served, fixing the maximum number of persons who could occupy the individual rooms of the premises concerned. In one case, legal proceedings were taken for contravention of such a Notice and a fine of £20 was imposed. Towards the end of the year, the Council adopted the policy of giving a Direction under Section 19 of the Housing Act, 1961, to each house in multiple occupation, fixing the highest number of individuals who can live there. Directions are made in all cases regardless as to whether or not there is a state of overcrowding. Thirty-two Directions were made by the end of the year and 45 Notices of Intention to make a Direction were served. Under the new legislation, it will be compulsory shortly for owners of houses let in multiple occupation to register with the local authority. This is a long-awaited piece of useful legislation.

Both of these were confirmed bacteriologically as being due to infection with the organism Salmonella Typhi Murium. Personal Hygiene The free washing facilities in the public conveniences, which were brought into operation in September, 1950, continued to be available throughout 1963. During that period 8,500 paper towels were issued free, and also 548 linen towels, which were provided at a cost of 2d. per person. Milk The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, transferred licensing to the food and drugs authority, which for this area is the Middlesex County Council. One distributor of bottled milk registered under the Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959, making a total of 40 on the register. Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947-1952. There are no manufacturers in the Borough. Sales consist almost entirely of pre-packed ice cream and serving from cans is found only in a few restaurants. Food Sampling The bacteriological analyses of 169 food samples, taken during the year, were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. One hundred and twenty-six of these specimens were ice cream samples covering six makes of ice cream, and following bacteriological analyses the ice creams were graded as follows:— Excellent 76 Satisfactory 37 Doubtful 3 Unsatisfactory 10 Thirty-six samples were taken of imitation cream. Twenty-one of these were excellent, fourteen satisfactory, and one was doubtful. Other samples taken:— Cooked brisket Satisfactory Corned beef Satisfactory Hazlet Satisfactory Cooked ham Satisfactory Liver sausage Satisfactory Luncheon sausage Satisfactory Rinse water of ice-cream server Unsatisfactory The following information has been obtained by courtesy of the Public Control Officer of Middlesex County Council on work carried out in Southall by staff of that Department. 40 Details are as follows:— Articles Total Samples Taken Unsatisfactory Milk 168 20 Alcoholic Drinks 10 — Butter 29 — Cream 17 — Drugs 3 — Fish 3 — Fruit 11 — Ice Cream 13 — Liver 8 — Meat 8 — Minced Meats 36 — Vinegar 17 — Miscellaneous 29 3 Totals 352 23 41 Milk Nineteen individual churns low in fat—bulk satisfactory.

In addition, the station which was established in 1959 at the Manor House, for the estimation of smoke and sulphur dioxide pollution by the volumetric method, whereby air is drawn through two filters, one dry and one liquid, continuously and the amount of atmospheric pollution calculated every 24 hours from the matter deposited on the filter, and from the amount of sulphur taken up by the liquid, continued to operate during 1963. A new station for volumetric estimations came into operation on 1st October, 1963, at Beaconsfield Technical College. For 1963 results, see page 45. The results obtained from the five sites (i.e. Recreation Ground and Railway Allotments —lead peroxide method; Hortus Cemetery, New Primary School, Railway Allotments— deposit gauges) are tabulated on pages 46 and 47 and graphs prepared from the figures on the table are to be found on pages 48 and 49. Comparison of ten years' averages at Hortus Cemetery. Total solids deposited:— 1954 14.30 1959 13.04 1955 16.94 1960 1030 1956 12.93 1961 10.86 1957 10.66 1962 11.32 1958 13.83 1963 8.88 Comparisons with three other places, i.e. Westminster, Cambridge and Sheffield, still show that Southall is atmospherically much less impure most of the year than a highly industrial area, but the Borough is included in a large ring round and including London itself designated as a black area for atmospheric pollution under the Clean Air Act, 1956. Smoke from industry has caused no special difficulty during the year and excessive or unnecessary emissions have usually been dealt with speedily by informal action. In one case, however, legal proceedings were taken in connection with an oil-fired boiler for an infringement of the Dark Smoke (Permitted Periods) Regulations, 1958. A fine of £25.0.0. was imposed, plus £5.5.0. costs. Twenty-two complaints of smoke or ash were received. In 13 cases, the nuisances were abated after informal action. In 9 cases, the complaints were not confirmed. The large timber yard mentioned in the last Annual Report now disposes of waste away from the premises. The fact that large quantities of sawdust and wood are no longer burnt has resulted in a considerable improvement in the neighbourhood around the yard. Smoke Control Areas Smoke Control Order No. 4 became operative on 1st July, 1963. The premises covered by operative Orders now total 3,194 houses, 41 industrial premises, 245 commercial premises, and 38 other buildings. Smoke Control Order No. 5 was confirmed at the beginning of 1963 and will become operative on 1st July, 1964. The area covered is 205 acres and includes 1,428 houses, 16 industrial premises, 50 commercial premises, and 4 other buildings. The survey of another area was begun during the year and it is expected that the Order will be submitted for confirmation at the beginning of 1964. Infringements of Smoke Control Orders There were no infringements in 1963. 44 Acid Smuts from Oil-burning chimneys The new insulated metal stacks referred to in the last Annual Report to serve four large oil-fired central heating boilers, were installed and in operation early in the year—and appear to have remedied the nuisance from acid smuts in the surrounding area. Volumetric Method The daily mean concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide is measured by volumetric apparatus in the Manor House. The gauge faces west and a main road in a built up area of residential and commercial premises. The term "smoke" is used to denote all fine suspended impurity collected by the test filter and expressed as microgrammes per cubic metre. The term "sulphur dioxide" includes all acid producing gases in the air with the exception of carbon dioxide and is the net acidity of the air calculated as sulphur dioxide and expressed as microgrammes per cubic metre of air.

Cyclone Fan Remedied Garage Remedied Steam condensing tank Remedied Car engine testing at night Remedied. Rodent Control The following table gives details of work carried out in accordance with the policy of the Council, as outlined in previous reports. Total notifications of Rats and Mice Confirmed Non-Confirmed 209 209 - Business and Industrial 26 premises treated Domestic 183 „ „ Rats found and cleared in 222 „ Mice „ „ „ „ 87 „ Total number of visits in 1963—1,457 Sewers Total number of manholes baited 121 Number of poison takes 11 No takes 110 These figures show a great increase in the amount of infestation by rats in domestic premises, and an increase in the sewer rat population. Rats are being encouraged by the increasingly wasteful habits of the population, and the carelessness of the people about the disposal of food waste. Streets and parks littered with food bags, fruit skins, discarded sandwiches, and cakes, make happy hunting and breeding-grounds for rats as well as flies— and the killing by dangerous poisons of individual rats or groups of rats will never keep pace with this large scale encouragement. The increasing use of rat poisons is now a danger to domestic pets, and residues in sewage effluents will require very careful watching by river and shore authorities who receive the outlets from the sewage purification works. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Seven establishments were licensed during the year. The number of animals kept in each case was small and conditions have remained satisfactory. Administration of the Shops Acts Routine visiting of shops in connection with the Shops Acts Regulations continued. During the year, 12 shopkeepers were prosecuted and fined for Sunday Trading—an offence under Shops Act, 1950. River Pollution Inspection of the rivers and canal of Southall during the year gave evidence of one individual site of pollution in Southall on which action could be and was, taken, but the general condition of the water continued to deteriorate. 53 Sampling of river water from the Brent at various stations in the County is carried out several times a year by officers of the Middlesex County Council. On three occasions during 1963 very bad results were obtained from these samplings, and it was necessary to investigate further—the pollution appeared to be industrial in origin. Certain defaulting firms were traced, but investigations on others were continuing at the end of 1963. One large industrial premises was found during 1963 to be discharging polluting effluent into the surface water sewer, and also into the Grand Union Canal—immediate attention was given to this, and the source of pollution removed. Two other sources of pollution were found, in one case agreement to permit effluent to enter Soil Sewer was made, in the other certain works within the factory had to be carried out, and this was done, but observation on this factory was still being maintained at the end of the year. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment Seven establishments were inspected for licence under this heading and all were found satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Details are as follows:— Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 3 Physiotherapy and Chiropody 4 The premises of one practitioner were found to be extremely dilapidated and unsuitable, so the issue of a licence was postponed in order that repairs could be carried out. Medical Examination of Borough Council Employees During 1963, a total of 102 medical examinations were carried out on applicants for Borough Council employment or members of the Borough Council staff. These examinations were carried out with regard to suitability for employment on the Council's permanent staff, for entry into the Sickness Pay Scheme, or for review after prolonged periods of sick leave. A survey of sickness absence amongst Borough Council staff during the year is shown in the table below, and the comparable statistics for the four previous years.

No abnormal increase occurred during 1963. The Radio Active Substances Act (1960) provided for the central registration and control of the keeping and use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive waste, and enabled the central authority to notify local authorities of the existence of registered premises within their boundaries. No notifications of this nature have yet been received in the Public Health Department. 55 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Through the Uxbridge Group Management Committee this authority maintains two hospitals in Southall, the Southall-Norwood Hospital (28 beds) for treatment of general medical and surgical cases and casualties, and Mount Pleasant Hospital (59 beds) for the treatment of geriatric cases. St. Bernard's Hospital is managed by its own Committee and is for the reception of cases of mental and nervous disorders; it has over 2,500 beds and takes patients from an extensive area comprising parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, including the Borough of Southall. Informal, temporary and compulsorily certified patients of all types are admitted, and all modern forms of treatment are carried out. Patients are now admitted informally (under the Mental Health Act, 1959) and Informal and Compulsory became the sole categories of admissions after 1st November, 1960. Other hospitals outside the Borough which are used to a considerable extent by patients from Southall are Hillingdon Hospital, West Middlesex Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Ealing. Southall cases of infectious disease mainly enter St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, which also has facilities for the treatment of geriatric cases. The greatest number attend Hillingdon, which has all the facilities of an acute general hospital, a geriatric section and a maternity wing, either as outpatients, or as inpatients; in 1963, 3,351 Southall residents had inpatient treatment in Hillingdon compared with 2,998 in 1962, and 1,562 in 1961. This figure includes 1,624 maternity mothers and babies discharged, compared with 1,362 in 1962, 1,170 in 1961, and 807 in 1960. During 1963, Mount Pleasant Hospital, a 59-bedded hospital, providing accommodation for 39 female and 20 male elderly patients, admitted 76 patients living within the Southall area. Re-decoration and minor improvements have been made to Lovibond Ward during the year, and a central linen store has been provided in the former X-ray Department. It is hoped to upgrade the Main Kitchen and Windle Ward during 1964. Plans have been prepared for eventual alterations to the centre part of Elizabeth West Ward, to provide much needed ancillary rooms and a day room. The W.V.S. continued to cater for the daily needs of the patients by a trolley shop around the Wards. A weekly library service was provided by the Red Cross Society. The Uxbridge Chest Clinic is the regional centre to which residents of the Borough of Southall may be referred regarding chest disorders. It is also the regional centre for the diagnosis, treatment, aftercare and prevention of tuberculosis (both pulmonary and nonpulmonary). Persons may be referred there by their own doctors, from Clinics, etc. Special "X-ray only" Clinics are available without appointment, otherwise persons are seen by appointment. There are male and female beds under the surveillance of clinic physicians at:— (1) Harefield Hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; and at (2) Hillingdon Hospital for the treatment of other chest disorders, and (3) Adelaide Ward of St. Bernard's Hospital—24 male and 24 female beds—for tuberculous patients—pulmonary and non-pulmonary.
