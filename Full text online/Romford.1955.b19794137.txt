Mr. Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I have the honour, herewith, to present to you this, my Annual Report on the Health of the District for the year 1955. This is the Twenty-second Report in the series, since I was appointed your Medical Officer of Health, and it is drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Article 17(5) of the Sanitary Officers' (Outside London) Regulations, 1935, and with Circular No. 17/55 of the Ministry of Health, dated 23rd November, 1955. The position 1 hold is that of Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, and Area Medical Officer for the Romford Area of the Essex County Council. So far as this Report is concerned, it deals with my duties in both capacities. My thanks are again gratefully tendered to all the members of the Borough Council, and the Health Area Sub-Committee, to the members of my staff, and to my fellow officials for all the assistance they have given me in the compilation of this report, or in the performance of the work. I am, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JAMES B. SAMSON, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Department, Town Hall, Romford.

Total 369 336 705 44 2 1 4 13 20 34 61 111 171 237 12 This year the Registrar-General has given his estimate of the mid-year population of Romford as 107,800, which compares with 105,900 for last year, an increase of 1,900. During 1955, the total number of live births registered was 1,915, and the total number of deaths registered was 705. The difference of 1,210 gives the total increase in the population. As this number falls short of the Registrar- General's estimated increase of 1,900, it follows that the balance of 690 is made up of Immigration over Emigration. For 1955, we estimate the Birth Rate to be 14.9 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population. This figure is obtained my multiplying the Crude Birth Rate of 17.8 by the Comparability Factor of 0.84. For last year, the Rate was 15.3. The Rate for England and Wales for 1955 is given as 15.0. The Death Rate for Romford is estimated at 9.2 per 1,000 of the estimated resident population. This figure is obtained by multiplying the Crude Death Rate of 6.5 by the Comparability Factor of 1.42. For last year the Rate was 9.1. The comparable Rate for England and Wales is 11.7. The chief causes of death in order of frequency were:— (1) Diseases of the Heart and Circulation. (2) Cancer. (3) Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Other Respiratory Diseases. 'The Maternal Mortality Rate, which is the number of Maternal Deaths, due to conditions associated with pregnancy or confinement per 1,000 total (live and still) births, is 0.5. The Infant Mortality Rate, or the Death Rate of Infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births, is 23.0, an increase of 2.3. The corresponding figure for England and Wales is 24.9. 13 1.—GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE AREA (i) Staff The particulars of staff are set out at the beginning of this report. The Assistant Medical Officers, Dental Staff, Nursing Staff, and Domestic Help Organiser, and, also the majority of the Clerical Staff, are under the jurisdiction of the Essex County Council, who are the Local Health Authority for the Part III duties of the National Health Service Act, 1946. (ii) Laboratory Facilities These remain as hitherto, and meet the requirements of the Department, and the General Practitioners. (iii) Nursing in the Home (a) General Nursing. At the end of the year 8 Home Nurses, and 4 Home Nurse/ Midwives were serving the area. These were employed in general domiciliary nursing, and, in addition, the Home Nurse/Midwives combined this work with midwifery duties. Under the provision of Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, sick-room equipment is available on loan, without charge. Table 3 sets out the work of the Home Nursing service, during the year. TABLE 3 (1) Number of visits paid 26,200 (2) Number of cases attended 1,580 (b) Domiciliary Midwives. At the end of the year 10 Domiciliary Midwives were employed, also the 4 Home Nurse/Midwives, referred to above. The following gives a summary of the cases attended by the Domiciliary Midwives, as Midwives, and as Maternity Nurses.

When necessary, use has been made of the Consultative Clinic at Oldchurch Hospital. During the year 495 individual expectant mothers attended the Ante-natal Clinics, of which 199 sessions were held. The total number of attendances of the Ante-natal mothers was '2,355, giving an average of 4.8 attendances per patient. The average number attending at each session was 11.3. Thirty-two Post-natal sessions were held, and 260 attendances were recorded. The average number attending at each session was 8.1. (v) Child Welfare Clinics. Twelve Child Welfare sessions are held each week. Altogether, there were 600 sessions, and the following table gives a summary of the attendances. TABLE 6 Individual children attending 3,577 Children under one year attending for the first time 1,383 Medical consultations 4,684 Attendances of children under one year of age 17,664 Attendances of children between the ages of one and five years 5,598 Average attendance per session 38.8 (vi) Health Visitors At the end of the year, there were 16 Health Visitors.

Permission was given during the year for the number of beds at the Home at 21 Gilbert Road, to be increased from 10 medical or chronic patients to 14. All the Homes were inspected on four occasions throughout the year, on behalf of the County Council, and conditions were found to be satisfactory. (viii) Domestic Helps The demand for this service has been fairly regular. During the year 145 Part-time and Casual Helps were employed, and they attended 691 individual cases. Tuberculous patients have again been aided by special volunteers. (ix) Day Nurseries The three Day Nurseries have been maintained as hitherto, the only alteration being that they are now closed on Saturdays. The average daily attendances for the year at each Nursery is shown below:— TABLE 8 "St. Moritz" Nursery 31 Collier Row Nursery 27 Rush Green Nursery 20 The "St. Moritz" and the Collier Row Nurseries are scheduled to take forty children each, and the Rush Green Nursery, fifty children. (x) Dental Service There has been no improvement in the recruitment of Dental Officers, and, at the end of the year, we had only 2 Dental Officers, and 2 Dental Attendants. For the most part their work has been in connection with the School Health Service. The following gives particulars of the work done during the year for expectant and nursing mothers, and children under school age:— TABLE 9 (a) Numbers provided with Dental care:— Examined Needing Treatment.

Mothercraft lectures, and exercises for expectant mothers are held on a weekly basis. The Minor Ailments' Room is utilised for the treatment of minor ailments amongst school children, and also for work in connection with Immunisations. Speech therapy, Orthopedic treatment, Physiotherapy, Artificial Sunlight, and Ophthalmic examinations are also available. A Dental Officer is in fall-time attendance for work among school children, and the priority classes, viz., nursing and expectant mothers, and children under 5 years of age. The General Practitioners' Wing is utilised by the same 9 practitioners as last year, and they have again had the services of nursing and clerical staff. New equipment and replacements have been provided, as and when required, and an Autoclave is now in use which obviates dressings having to be sent to a neighbouring hospital for sterilisation. During the year, a Dentist was appointed by the Executive Council for General Dental Services, and, in this connection, the Local Authority provided the services of a Dental Attendant. A dental X-ray apparatus has been obtained for the use of both Dentists. 2.—SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA (i) Water Mr. H. G. Ramsay, Chief Engineer of the South Essex Waterworks Company, has kindly given me the following report with regard to the water supply to the district:— (a) There have been no new extensions of public water supply daring the year 1955, other than those for the supply to permanent housing sites. (b) Lengths of mains laid, in vards:— 3" 4" 6" Romford Area 2,211 3,509 191 (c) The water supply of the area, and of its several parts, has been satisfactory, both as to quality and quantity. (d) Bacteriological and Chemical examinations are made of the raw water, of the water in its various stages of treatment, of the water supplied from the Company's wells, and of the water going into supply. Analyses are also made of samples obtained from consumers' taps in various parts of the Company's district; all proved to be satisfactory. A total of over 3,900 Chemical, Bacteriological, and Biological examinations have been made, 17 (e) The waters are not liable to plunibo-solvent action. (f) No contamination has arisen, therefore, no action has been necessary." In addition to the analyses carried out by the Waterworks Company, samples have also been taken from consumers' taps by the Sanitary Inspectors, and sent for Bacteriological analyses once per month, and Chemical analyses once per six months, and the results have confirmed the findings of the Campany.

(iii) Meat. There are 3 licensed slaughterhouses in the Borough, and one of them is licensed for the slaughter of horses. Altogether, 24,673 animals were slaughtered for human consumption. The Sanitary Inspectors, as usual, paid visits, not only to the Slaughterhouses, but also to the Meat Depots, Butchers' Shops, Stalls, etc. Table 12 sets out the particulars of the carcases inspected, and condemned;— 21 TABLE 12.

In addition to the premises used for Milk, Ice-Cream, and Meat, referred to above, the following are registered under the Romford Urban District Council Act, 1931, and are subject to the Clean Food Byelaws. Bakers 32 Caf&s 59 Confectioners 62 Fishmongers 30 Greengrocers 47 Grocers 121 Miscellaneous 12 Hawkers 29 There are also 45 food stalls situated in the Market Place on three days of the week. All the above are regularly inspected. During the year, 796 such inspections were made. The majority of the food shops now have constant hot water provided for washing purposes. (v) Unsound Food. During the year, 435 visits were made to food premises, mainly on request, for the purpose of dealing with unsound food, and a total quantity of 8 tons, 12 cwts., 75 lbs. of food was surrendered as unfit for human consumption. Where possible all unsound food is disposed of for animal feeding—the remainder is dealt with by the Cleansing Department. (vi) The Food and Drugs Acts, 1938 - 1954. During 1955, 315 samples were submitted for analysis, comprising 66 Formal, and 249 Informal. Table 13 sets out the types of food examined. Of the 66 Formal samples taken, 2 proved to be not genuine. Of these, one consisted of Pork Sausages that contained only 67% of meat, this was reported to the Health Committee, who, in view of the recent High Court ruling, decided not to institute proceedings, but to send a strong letter of warning to the manufacturer. The second unsatisfactory sample was of Whisky, which the Analyst reported as being only 64.3° proof and containing 1% of water. This whisky was sold from a bottle labelled 70° proof. The information has been forwarded to the Minister requesting permission to institute proceedings under the Labelling of Food Order, 1953 ; but authority had not been received by the end of the year. Of the Informal samples the following were reported on adversely Bread.—The following samples were submitted as a result of complaints. 3 samples of bread which were alleged to be contaminated with dirt were found on examination to contain small areas of vegetable grease from the machines. Letters were sent to the manufacturers in each case. 23 2 samples of bread were alleged to contain mouse droppings— on examination the particles in the bread were found to be cylindrical bodies of charred dough. 1 sample, alleged to have a peculiar taste, was found to contain an excess of salt. This information was passed on to the authority in whose area the bread was manufactured. Fruit Squash.—One sample submitted on complaint, was found to contain suspended matter, consisting of miscellaneous dirt, sawdust and gritty matter. A warning letter was sent to the manufacturers. Grease from Baker's Mixing Machine.—A sample of grease taken from a baker's mixing machine, following complaints of grease being found in bread, was found to consist mainly of mineral oil. The bakers were advised on methods to adopt, in order to prevent this grease entering the mixing bowl. Meat Pie.—A complaint was made concerning the presence of tobacco in a meat pie, and, on analysis, the meat content was found to contain 2 grains of finely shredded tobacco, similar to that used for cigarettes. The matter was reported to the Health Committee, which resolved to send a strong letter of warning to the manufacturer. Milk.—A sample of milk was sent to the analyst, on receipt of a complaint as to its smell and appearance. The analyst reported that this milk contained 2.2% of Potassium Cyanide. The details were forwarded to the Police. Nuts.—One sample of mixed nuts was found to bave a high percentage that was decomposed and unsound, on being informed of this the vendor withdrew the remainder from sale. Pickled Onions.—One sample of pickled onions, taken informally, was not labelled in accordance with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order, 1953. The Health Committee resolved to forward the information to the Minister. The manufacturers withdrew all other pickles from sale, and relabelled them in accordance with the Order. Sausages.—Three samples of sausages were found to contain Sulphur Dioxide without the proper declaration being made, and three samples were found to have a low meat content. These matters were taken up with the manufacturers. Legal Proceedings.

Altogether 3,118 inspections and observations have been made for various purposes under the Act during the year. During these inspections the following contraventions were noted :— Failure to exhibit prescribed Notices 637 Failure to keep records 115 Conditions of employment 49 Sanitary accommodation 32 Washing facilities 4 Other matters 39 In order to draw the attention of the occupiers to these contraventions, 185 informal notices were served, and 169 verbal cautions were given; as a result the majority of the contraventions were rectified by the end of the year, and others were receiving attention. (b) Exemption Certificates. On being satisfied that alternative arrangements were reasonably available and satisfactory, the Council have issued one Certificate, under Section 38(6) of the Act, exempting the occupier of a certain shop from providing sanitary accommodation and washing facilities. Two certificates of exemption were withdrawn in respect of sanitary accommodation and washing facilities. Legal Proceedings. The Council authorised the following cases to be taken before the Magistrates Court in respect of contraventions under the Shops Act, 1950:— Offence Section Result (i) Failing to keep records of Sunday Employment 22(3) Fined £2 (ii) Failing to keep records of Sunday Employment 22(3) Fined £2 (iii) Sunday Trading 47 Fined £2 (iv) Sunday Trading 47 Fined £2 (v) Sunday Trading 47 Fined £2 (vi) Sunday Trading 47 Fined £2 (vii) Sunday Trading 47 Fined £2 27 (viii) The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 153 premises have been visited where heating appliances were exposed for sale, and advice has been given on the requirements of the Act to persons responsible. As a result of these visits, 60 appliances were found not to conform with the standards prescribed. In one instance, the Council authorised legal proceedings. Legal Proceedings. Offence Section Result (i) Exposing for sale a heating appliance fitted with a guard not conforming to the standards prescribed 1 Fined £3 plus £'2.2.0 costs. 4.—HOUSING STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR, 1955 TABLE 14 Number of houses erected during the year— (1) By Local Authority 261 (2) By Private Enterprise 604 (3) By L.

Housing Repairs and. Rents Act, 1954. During the year 35 applications were received for Certificates of Disrepair under the above Act, and 32 Certificates were issued, making a total of 86 Certificates issued since October, 1954. 48 applications were also received for the Revocation of Certificates, and in 45 cases the Certificates were revoked when the repairs had been completed satisfactorily. 5. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES (i) Notifiable Diseases. As, is usual, I have not recorded the notifications where the diagnosis has been altered after a period of observation, or after investigation. When, however, the amended diagnosis has proved to be another type of infection which is notifiable, the case has been appropriately recorded. The amendments are sent to the RegistrarGeneral at the end of each quarter. (a) Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis. In contrast to last year, Poliomyelitis was more in evidence, generally, throughout the Country, and this was reflected in a correspondingly larger number of cases in Romford. During 1955, 4 cases were notified in the earlier part of the year, but it was not until the beginning of August and onwards that the bulk of the cases occurred, and it was during this period that we had 13 cases with varying degrees of paralysis, and 16 of the non-paralytic variety. One of the patients, unfortunately, died. (b) Acute Infective Hepatitis. This condition is still notifiable for research purposes, throughout the Eastern Region. Altogether, there were 28 notifications. (c) Diphtheria. This year one case of Diphtheria was reported. No organism was isolated, but the diagnosis was based on palatal paralysis. The following statistics relate to the state of Immunisation at 31st December, 1955. In addition to the initial series of injections, "booster" doses have been administered. TABLE 15 Under 5 yrs. 5-15 yrs Number of children who had completed a full course of Immunisation at any time up to 31st December, 1955, and who were born between 31st December, 1940, and 31st December, 1955 4,986 14,694 30 (d) Dysentery. Seven cases of Dysentery were notified, as belonging to Romford. Two of these were due to Shigella Sonnei, and five were unclassified. (e) Food Poisoning. During the year, 24 cases were notified, which proved to be suffering from food poisoning. In addition, another 28 proved indefinite. The following table sets out the details, as required by the Ministry of Health:— TABLE 16 (a) Total number of outbreaks 5 (b) Total number of cases included in (a) 11 (c) Number of single cases 41 (d) Number of deaths Nil (e)(i) Organisms responsible Sal. TyphiMurium C. Welchii Unknown (ii) Outbreaks attributable to (i) 3 2 Nil (iii) Single cases attributable to (i) 11 2 28 (f) Measles. Measles was present in epidemic form during the first half of the year, although, in fact, the numbers first showed a rise in November, 1954. Over the past few years the close relationship with London has had the effect of involving us in their epidemiology, and this has, particularly, been noticeable in the case of Measles which, in London, has recurred in epidemic form every two years. During 1955, however, the Country, generally, experienced one of its worst epidemics on record. Altogether, throughout the year, 2,807 cases were notified. (g) Scarlet Fever. The notifications numbered 149, and the type was mild, which has been consistent with this condition for very many years. (h) Smallpox. No cases occurred in the district, but 3 members of the crew of a ship and residents of Romford were kept under surveillance for the requisite period, as a passenger had been landed at Suez suffering from Smallpox. 31 Table 17 gives the statistics relative to Vaccination, as recorded by the General Practitioners. TABLE 17 Vaccinated: Under 6 months 342 Between the ages of 6 months and 1 year 145 Between the ages of 1 and 2 years 44 Between the ages of 2 and 5 years 77 Between the ages of 5 and 15 years 75 Over 15 years 144 Re-Vaccinated: Under 1 year of age — Between the ages of 1 and 2 years — Between the ages of 2 and 5 years 8 Between the ages of 5 and 15 years 50 Over 15 years 306 (i) Tuberculosis. The team of the Medical Research Council, which, for some years, has been investigating the value of Anti-Tuberculosis Vaccines, revisited the area on two occasions, and, prior to, and during these periods the Health Visitors gave willing aid. Also, the scheme whereby B.C.G. Vaccination is offered, with parental consent, to children at the age of 13 years, was continued on the same lines as last year, with the following results:— TABLE 18 Number of pupils tuberculin tested 344 Number found to be positive 45 Number found to be negative 299 Number who received B.C.G. 277 Number post-tested 266 Number found to be positive 258 Number found to be negative 8 It is again with satisfaction that I record that the new cases of Respiratory Tuberculosis have diminished by 13, and the Deaths are fewer by 9. (j) Whooping Cough. Altogether, 179 cases were notified. For the most part, they were fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. During 1955, 1,273 children received immunisation injections. 32 (ii) Non-Notifiable. The prevalence of these is again set out below, and the figures are compiled from the school returns. As they are not notifiable, however, the general prevalence is unknown. 6.—SUPPLEMENTARY. (i) Section 47, National Assistance Act, 1948. It was not found necessary to take any formal action under this Section. On the two or three occasions when investigations had to be made, other means were found to achieve a satisfactory solution.
