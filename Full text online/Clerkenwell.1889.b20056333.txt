The Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell beg to present the following Report of their proceedings and other matters connected therewith during the year ended on 25th March, 1890. The Parish of Clerkenwell contains 380 acres, about 65 of which are situate in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill. According to the last census the population was 69,019. The number of Assessments in the Parish is 8557 the rateable value being £364,130. The Parish is divided into five wards, as follows: Ward No. 1 (Pentonville) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies north of a line drawn from the west boundary of the Parish at Battle Bridge, along the centre of Pentonville Road, to the east boundary of the Parish at the top of the City Road, thence up High Street and Liverpool Road to Sermon Lane, thence westward (according to the boundary of the Parish) to Caledonian Road, including Nos. 61 to 77 and 68 to 100 in that road, and 6 to 17 Caledonian Crescent, thence to the western boundary at Battle Bridge, and all that B 6 portion of the Parish which is situate at or about Muswell Hill. This Ward contains 1701 assessments, of a rateable value of £63,018 and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 2 (St. Philip's) comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies within a line drawn along the centre of King's Cross Road, from Baker Street to Battle Bridge, thence up Pentonville Road to the north-west corner of Claremont Square, thence down Amwell Street and Rosoman Street to Exmouth Street, along Exmouth Street and Mount Pleasant to the boundary, thence along the bounddary of the Parish to King's Cross Road, bottom of Baker Street, including nearly the whole of the House of Correction site. This Ward contains 1451 assessments, of a rateable value of £53,017 and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 3 (St. Mark's) comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn along Pentonville Road, from the north-west corner of Claremont Square, to the junction of City Road and Goswell Road, thence down Goswell Road to the corner of Spencer Street, (including Nos. 290 to 320 on the north-east side of Goswell Road, and Nos. 1 and 30 in Sidney Street,) thence along Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Rosoman Street, and Amwell Street, to the north-west corner of Claremont Square. This Ward contains 1264 assessments of a rateable value of £60,241 and returns twelve members to the Vestry. Ward No. 4 (St. James'), comprises all that portion of the Parish within a line drawn from Goswell Road, along the centre of Spencer Street, Myddelton Street, Exmouth Street, Mount 7 Pleasant, to the boundary of the Parish, thence along the line of the Old Fleet Ditch to the new street opposite Clerkenwell Green, (and thence along Clerkenwell Green (north side of Sessions House) and Aylesbury Street to St. John Street, thence up the centre of St. John Street to Percival Street, along the centre of Percival Street, and up Goswell Road to Spencer Street. This Ward contains 2419 assesments, of a rateable value of £102,488 and returns eighteen members to the Vestry. Ward No. 5 (St. John's), comprises all that portion of the Parish which lies south of the southern boundary of Ward 4, bounded on the east by a line drawn along the centre of Goswell Road from Percival Street to Clerkenwell Road, on the west by the Old Fleet Ditch, and on the south by a line drawn from Goswell Road down Clerkenwell Road, thence irregularly, according to the boundary of the Parish, to the Old Fleet Ditch. This Ward contains 1722 assessments, of a rateable value of £85,366 and returns fifteen members to the Vestry. Muswell Hill.— With regard to this outlaying portion of the Parish, the following extract from Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell will be of interest, especially to those unacquainted with its history:— "There is a small detached portion of the Parish, situate at Muswell, or Muswell Hill, about five miles and a half from London, and on the north-western confines of Hornsey. This little tract (about 65 acres) was given to the Nunnery of Clerkenwell by Beauvais, Bishop of London, about the year 1112; and having become famous through a legendary tale of a 'great cure performed upon a King of Scot, who was, by some divine intelligence, advised to take the water of a well in England, called Muswell,' a Chapel was erected on the spot, 'sometime bearing the name of our Lady of Muswell. Here was placed an image of 'Our Lady, whereunto was a continual resort in the way of pilgrimage.' This Chapel (which of course was an appendage 8 to the Nunnery) had sunk, along with many other fabrics originating in religious romance, before the reign of Elizabeth; aud, when Norden wrote, an Alderman Roe had 'a proper house occupying the site.' "The Wells, from which this tract and the bill comprising it take name, are two in number, and continue in good preservation, being bricked round to the depth from which they seemingly spring (about five feet and a half), and enclosed be sides from the field wherein they are situated, by wooden railings. Though a few yards only asunder, their waters differ in quality; that of the one being hard, sweet, and beautifully pellucid, while the other more nearly resembles rain water, and is used only for the purposes to which the latter is commonly applied. Neither are at present supposed to possess any medicinal properties. An infant brook issues from their united and ceaseless overflowing; which descending the hill and winding through the adjacent meadows, at length finds its way to the comparatively distant Lea River. "This tract is regularly visited, and its limits marked at the perambulation of the Parish, which takes place septennially; it is at present entirely under pasturage. The only habitations upon it are two by the road side, traditionally said to occupy the site of the dairy farm, which in the monastic time sent its produce to the nuns of Clerkenwell. Part of an adjoining house being also within the parochial line (as is signified by the usual initials affixed to its front), the perambulators are obliged to pass through this latter dwelling in order to assert their long established boundary." This part of the Parish has within the last few years been laid out for building purposes. New roads have been formed, and there are now 50 houses in assessment. Rates.— During the year the Rates made by the Vestry were as follows :— For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1889. A Poor Rate of 1s. 6d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £25,110 A Metropolitan Consolidated Rate 2½d. „ „ ,, 3,487 A Sewer Rate 1d. ,, ,, ,, 1,395 A General Rate l0d. ,, „ „ 13,950 2s. 7½d. £43,942 9 For the half-year to Lady-day, 1890. A Poor Rate of 1s. 6d. including a Library Rate of 1d. in the £, estimated to realize nett £25,200 A Sewer Rate 1d. ,, „ ,, 1,400 A Lighting Rate 2d. ,, ,, ,, 2,800 A General Rate 1s. 1d. ,, ,, „ 18,400 2s. 10d. £47,800 The rates made in April, for the half-year to Michaelmas, were based upon a rateable value of £360,797, and those made in October, for the halfyear to Lady-day, upon a rateable value of £362,430. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £26,109 in the first, and £25,246 in the second half-year, total ,£51,355 (the average for 14 years previous to the amalgamation of Clerkenwell with the Holborn Union, when Clerkenwell managed its own poor under the Local Act, being £28,093, the highest year being £34,534). The Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund, £4,959 19s. Od. and £5,463 15s. Od. in the first and second half-years respectively. A Metropolitan Consolidated Rate of 2½d. in the £ was made in the first half-year to provide for the Precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works, for the three months ending March 31st, 1889, amounting to £3,772 17s. 3d. The amounts above stated as being required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union include the Precepts of the London County Council, whose rate is now collected in the Poor Rate, whereas the requirements of the Metropolitan Board of Works were raised by a separate rate called the Metropolitan Consolidated Rate. The Council's precepts in respect of the Parish of Clerkenwell were £10,909 6s. 4d. in the first, and £7,790 4s. 8d. in the second half-year. Under the Local Government 10 Act constituting the Council, they receive from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue local taxation licenses, including licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors, for game, dogs, guns, auctioneers, tobacco, carriages, hawkers, pawnbrokers, armorial bearings, &c., &c , together with two-fifths of the probate duty paid within the County of London From these, till now imperial funds, the Council pays certain public grants hitherto paid from the Imperial Exchequer for Teachers in Poor Law Schools, Public Vaccinators, Registrars of Births and Deaths, Paupers, Lunatics, Poor Law Medical Officers, and the Metropolitan Police. The balance of the Exchequer Contribution Account remaining after payment of these grants is carried to the General County Account, and from this Account the Council have to pay to the Guardians of every Poor Law Union wholly in London a sum equal to 4d. per head per day for every indoor pauper maintained in that Union. The share of the Parish of Clerkenwell of the latter amount for the year ending Lady-day, 1890, is £8,653. The precept of the School Board for the year 1889, was for the sum of £13,252 6s. Od. The Police precepts for the year amounted to £7,475 10s. 10d. It will thus be seen that of the £91,742 raised during the year, the sum of £65,425 was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. 5,575 Summonses have been issued for the recovery of the rates for the four quarters of the year, representing an average of 1,394 per quarter, a reduction of 15 per quarter. This appears a large number, but it is quite evident that a very large proportion of the persons summoned are content to wait for the summons, treating it as the "final demand " for payment, preferring to pay the small 11 fee of 1s. charged for the summons and hearing, and to hold their money, as a matter of convenience, as long as possible. That this is so is patent from the fact that only about five per cent, of those summoned attend the hearing, the bulk of the remainder paying without further proceedings being necessary. 153 Committal Warrants were granted in respect of non-payment of rates, averaging 38 per quarter, the majority of the cases being those of persons who set the Vestry at defiance, and have no goods on the premises on which distress can be levied, and it may be taken that practically the same persons form the cases each quarter. In the large majority of these cases also, when proceedings have reached this extreme, the money is forthcoming. An average of 10 cases per quarter were excused by the justices on account of poverty. Valuation Lists—Four Provisional Valuation Lists and one Supplemental List have been made out during the year, dealing with 271 assessments and resulting in an increase in the rateable value of £3,148. School Board Precepts—The following is a list of the Precepts of the School Board, on the Parish of Clerkenwell, since it was called into existence by the Elementary Education Act, 1870 :— £ 8. d. £ s. d. 1871 511 8 9 1881 - 7,900 4 4 1872 943 11 2 1882 - 8,067 10 5 1873 780 0 2 1883 - 9,397 16 2 1874 1,869 9 3 1884 - 11,054 2 2 1875 3,267 12 11 1885 - 11,999 1 10 876 4,897 4 9 1886 - 12,890 9 0 1877 6,04; 10 1 1887 - 12,210 12 5 1878 6,013 14 10 1888 - 11,717 15 1 1879 6,371 8 11 1889 - 13,252 6 0 1880 7,436 9 8 1890 - 16,052 19 4 12 Metropolitan Board Precepts- The following is a list of the Precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works since the passing of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, to the coming into force of the Local Government Act, 1888, in March, 1889.

All land to be equally assessed to rates, whether vacant or occupied, and all buildings to be assessed to rates if vacant beyond a limited time. The assessment of all property to be made for the whole of London upon a uniform basis, and by one authority. Owners as well as occupiers to be made directly liable for a due proportion of all Rates. The whole system of collection of Rates in London to be investigated with a view to simplification and economy. The Vestry came to the following resolutions thereon :— That having regard to the difficulty and expense of arriving at "market value," as distinguished from " actual or estimated rental," the Vestry take no action with reference to the proposal that all land and buildings be assessed to rates on market values and not on actual or estimated rentals or profits. That the Vestry disagree with the proposal that all land should be equally assessed to rates, whether vacant or occupied, and that all building be assessed to rates if vacant beyond a limited time. That the Vestry is of opinion that under the Valuation Act, 1869, there already exists a uniform basis of valuation, which on the whole has proved satisfactory, and they consider that it is undesirable that all valuations should be carried out by one authority. That the Vestry express the opinion that the time has arrived when Ground Rents should be rated in relief of Local Taxation. That the Vestry are of opinion that the system to be adopted in the collection of the rates is best left in the hands of the local authorities as at present. Electric Lighting.— In May, 1889, the Board of Trade forwarded to the Vestry a copy of Major Marindin's report, made after his enquiry into the various applications for Provisional Orders and 14 Licenses under the Electric Lighting Acts, and into the subject matter of a Bill introduced into Parliament by the Metropolitan Supply Company, Limited. This Report contained the following clause—"The case of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell is difficult to deal with. This Parish is cut off from the district which I propose to allot to the London Company, and the Metropolitan Company has abandoned the North London Order in which it was included, while the Vestry has assented to the entrance of both Companies. If the City should consent to allot a district to the London Company, giving access to Clerkenwell, this Parish should be added to the London area, otherwise it might be suggested to the Metropolitan Company to adhere to their North London Order as far as this Parish is concerned." When this Report came before the Vestry it appeared that it was proposed to allot to the Metropolitan Company, under their Mid-London Order, an area in which St. Sepulchre, Saffron Hill and Holborn would be embraced. The Vestry therefore addressed letters to the Board of Trade and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, suggesting that the Parish of Clerkenwell should be included in the Mid-London Order. It was, however, added to the London Company's area, and in June the Board of Trade proceeded to settle the Schedule of Streets, and the amount of deposit to be made by the undertakers. The Clerk and the Surveyor attended the Board of Trade on the occasion, and reported that, after discussion as to the main thoroughfares in the Parish, it was ultimately agreed that Saint John Street and Saint John Street Road to Pentonville Road, and Pentonville Road from the "Angel" to the boundary of the Parish near King's Cross would be fair and suitable thoroughfares to be scheduled for 15 the purpose; also that £1030 would be a fair and suitable sum to be deposited by the Company as a guarantee of good faith, and to protect the Vestry against possible liabilities as to cost of works by way of disturbance of the roadways, and that with regard to the condition laid down by the Vestry of the 28th February last, when they gave their consent to the schemes, viz., that the Companies enter into an agreement or embody a clause in the Provisional Orders that they will be responsible for the repair of the paving over the pipes for a period of three years following the laying of such pipes, the Board of Trade stated through their representative, Mr. Courtenay Boyle, that it was not in their power to impose such a condition legally as the clauses in the Gas Act relating to paving were incorporated in the Electric Lighting Act, nor did they think it necessary, having regard to the nature and extent of the disturbance of the roadway for Electric Lighting purposes. On the 1st July the Board of Trade forwarded a copy of the London Electric Supply Corporation's Order, and stated that a Bill to confirm such Order would be introduced into the House of Commons at the earliest possible moment, and such Bill was duly introduced and passed. The Board subsequently forwarded a statement furnished by the Company as to their financial position for carrying out their Order by which it appeared that the total capital is £1,1,250,000 of which £605,000 was paid up, £200,000 subscribed but not paid up, and £445,000 unissued. The Company forwarded for the information of the Vestry a sample of their main for electric lighting purposes. On the 15th November the Board of Trade informed the Vestry that the Company have secured to their satisfaction the sum of £13000, and that they are satisfied that 16 the Company are in a position to carry out their Order. For the Session of 1890, the Brush Electric Engineering Company gave notice of their intention to make application for a Provisional Order, and the plans, &c., were duly submitted to the Vestry, who fully considered them, and gave their formal assent to the proposal, but in consequence of a technical irregularity in the form of their notice, the Board of Trade decided not to deal with their application in the present Session. Widening of Rosoman Street and Closing of St. James' Buildings—In November, 1889, the Vestry received a letter from Mr. Farrant, Deputy Chairman and Managing Director of the Artizans', Labourers' and General Dwellings' Company, stating that the Company has taken on lease from the Marquis of Northampton a piece of land about an acre in extent, bounded by Rosoman Street, Corporation Row, and Plumbers Place, and that it is their intention to pull down the whole of the houses standing on the ground, and to build, with abundant provisions for air and light, and playgrounds, blocks of dwellings for artizans, with shops and basements along the frontage of Rosoman Street, and proposing that the widening of Rosoman Street should be effected by the land occupied by St. James Buildings and the narrow passage leading therefrom to Corporation Row, amounting to 3,472-ft. 7in., being given up by the Vestry in exchange for the land marked blue on the plan which he enclosed, and which measures 3,671-ft. 8in., which would increase the width of Rosoman Street at the north end, from 17-ft. 8-in to 29-ft. 3-in.; at the centre, from 24-ft 10-in to 33-ft. 8-in; and at the south end, from 28-ft. 4-in. to 40-ft. 1 -in, thus increasing the width at the two ends by nearly 12-ft. 17 A letter, at the same meeting, was read from Mr. F. A. Ford,L.C.C. stating that a rumour had reached the Clerkenwell Improvement Committee, a temporary body, of which he was a member, that there was some fear of the dwellings in Rosoman Street being erected without any provision being made for the widening of the present exceedingly narrow roadway, and that the foregoing letter of Mr. Tarrant's was the result of suggestions by his Committee, and urging the Vestry to approve the plans. These communications were referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report, and Mr. Farrant was asked to attend the Committee upon the subject. When before the Committee, Mr. Farrant, in reply to questions, stated that there was no clause whatever in their lease stipulating that the roadway of Rosoman Street should be widened, and that the reason why they could not make the roadway 40-ft. wide all through was, that if they did so, the piece ot land at the North end would be absolutely valueless for building purposes, as it would not be deep enough, and that it was a matter for negociation whether they would take the three houses at the North end ; but that if they did, they would be prepared to treat the Vestry in a liberal spirit, and widen the street; and that he was prepared to pave the whole of the footway in front of their new buildings with 2½-in. York Paving, and 12 by 8 Granite Kerb, to the width and the levels that the Surveyor to the Vestry shall set out. The Committee thereupon recommended that the proposal of the Company as shewn in the plans be agreed to, the Company paving the whole of the frontages with 2½-in. York Paving and 12 by 8 18 Granite Kerb, to the width and levels set out by the Vestry's Surveyor. On the subject coming before the Vestry, an amendment to the Committee's report was carried, objecting to the Company's proposals unless they gave up sufficient ground to the public way to enable this Street to be widened to 40-feet throughout, and pay the cost of the additional paving. Mr. Farrant replied that he had gone to the utmost extent in his power, and that the Company would proceed with the buildings, and that, should the Vestry desire to re-open the matter on the basis of his proposition, he should be glad to hear from them, and representing that the rejection by the Vestry of the proposition meant that the roadway and paving of Rosoman Street would remain exactly as at present, as he could not give up for the purpose of widening Rosoman Street any land unless he obtained an equivalent for it. The subject was referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report, and Mr. Farrant was invited to attend the meeting. The Vestry also wrote to the agent of the Marquis of Northampton asking whether there is any provision in the lease to the Artizans' Dwellings Company that land should be given up for the widening of Rosoman Street. A letter was received from Mr. Boodle, agent to the Marquis Northampton, stating that no lease had yet been granted to the Artizans', &c., Company of the site which they are building upon, but the tems of a draft building contract are in negociation, and that it has always been intended to set back the actual building line in Rosoman Street to the line shewn on Mr. Farrant's plan; but no arrangements have been made as to widening the actual thoroughfare. 19 At the Committee meeting Mr. Farrant was asked whether he was prepared to pay the cost of widening the carriageway as well as laying the new footway and kerb, estimated at £419. Mr Farrant replied that his Company could not undertake to bear the whole of the cost of the re-modelling of the roadway, and whilst denying any liability on the part of his Company, or the right of the Vestry to call upon them to bear such expense, he was willing to pledge his Company to the extent of £100, and, after further discussion, Mr. Farrant agreed to contribute £200, providing the consent of the Vestry be given to their plans as submitted, but this would be the utmost he could promise ; and this offer was accepted by the Vestry, and the necessary steps are therefore in progress to give effect to the arrangement. Discovery of Human Remains in Rosoman Street.— In excavating for the new buildings in Rosoman Street, the Artizans', Labourers' and General Dwellings Company discovered several coffins, as though the place was once a burial ground. The Vestry Clerk therefore communicated the fact to the Home Secretary, and received a letter in reply stating that under the special circumstances of the case there did not appear to be any occasion for a license for removal of the coffins and remains, and recommending that the coffins and remains should be removed to some Burial ground where they can legally be re-buried, and that the work of removal should be carried out under the supervision, and to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health for Clerkenwell. The subject was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, and they visited the place and saw Mr. Farrant, the Managing Director, who stated that the Company had made 20 all arrangements for a search for and removal of all the remains there might be in the ground, and for their proper interment in Nun head Cemetery. No further information was forthcoming as to how or when the interments took place. The Committee had before them Cromwell's History of Clerkenwell, dated 1828, which refers to a Quaker's Workhouse, situate at the north west angle of the ground on which the House of Detention now stands, founded in 1692 for the maintenance of 50 decayed people of that persuasion, and removed in 1786 to a more eligible site, and it appears possible that this ground being then open was used as a burial place in connection with that institution. The history referred to, however, speaks of that part of Rosoman Street being prior to 1774 (when it was built upon) "a succession of gardens" and this is borne out by a plan of the Parish at the Guildhall Library, dated 1746, and inspected by Mr. Farrant. Artizans' Dwellings, Hughes Field (Deptford) Area.— In July a letter was received from the Vestry of St Luke, forwarding resolution that a respectful representation be made to the Home Secretary of the inexpediency of the recent determination of the London County Council to build artizans' dwellings upon portions of land comprising the Hughes Fields (Deptford) area. The Vestry agreed with the views of the Vestry of St. Luke, and made a representation to the Home Secretary to the same effect. On the same subject, the Vestry subsequently received a letter from the Town Ward Ratepayers' Association of the Parish of Kensington, expressing the opinion that the various Local Authorities should enforce the keeping of the dwellings of the poor in a sanitary condition, and that the London 21 County Council will not be acting in the best interests of the Ratepayers if they determine to erect dwellings for the poor, which should be the work of private enterprise; and a reply was forwarded, stating the action already taken by the Vestry in the matter. Artizan's Dwellings Acts, 1868-82.—During the year the Vestry took proceedings under these Acts in the following cases:— 33*, White Lion Street.—The Medical Officer, on the 23rd May, certified that these premises (a stable and woodshed) were unfit for human habitation, and his representation was referred to the Surveyor, who reported that the premises consisted on the first floor of one room, 13-ft. 2-in. by 13-ft. by 9-ft. high, occupied by three persons, man, wife, and boy aged 13 years ; and on the ground floor one room, 13-ft. 2-in. by 13-ft. by 9-ft. 7-in. high, used as a wood chopping shed and donkey's stable, and that there is a small yard in rear, common to these premises and No. 34A, White Lion Street, with one w.c., also common to the two houses; that the premises appear to have been let as a stable to the occupier, and were in such a defective and dilapidated condition that no amount of structural alterations could possibly make them fit for human habitation, and he recommended that an order be made for closing same. The Vestry thereupon made an Order in accordance with the Surveyor's representation, and such use of the premises was shortly afterwards discontinued, and the place used only as workshops. 41, Collier Street. — In October the Medical Officer of Health represented that these premises were in a condition dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation. The representation being referred to the Surveyor, he reported that the c 22 premises could be rendered habitable by somewhat extonsive repairs. A copy of the reports was therefore served on the owner, whose agent attended the Vestry, and stated that part of the necessary work had been done, and expressed his willingness to carry out such repairs as the Vestry might order to render the place fit for habitation. The Vestry therefore made an Order in accordance with the Surveyor's recommendations. 12 and 13, Crawford Passage.— In October also the Medical Officer of Health certified that these premises were in a condition dangerous to health so as to bo unfit for human habitation. The representation being referred to the Surveyor, ho reported that the premises wore partly closed, but that there were still some persons residing there, that he was of opinion that no amount of alterations or repairs could make the promises fit for human habitation, and ho recommended that an order be immediately made for entirely closing them up. At the same Meeting a letter was read from the City Solicitor, stating that for several weeks past the Corporation, who were the owners, had been endeavouring to get peaceable vacant possession of the property with the view of its being pulled down, that they had succeeded in getting 13 out of the 16 tenants out, and were endeavouring to oust the remainder, and that he had already given instructions that, unless peaceable measures were successful in the course of 24 hours, the usual application would be made to the Magistrate. Copies of the Medical Officer's and Surveyor's Reports were thereupon served upon the City Corporation, and at the Meeting at which the matter was to be further considered, the Medical Officer reported that the premises were being pulled down, and therefore no order was made. 23 3, Ann's Place.—On the 31st October, the Medical Officer condemned these premises as dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation. The Surveyor reported that the defects could be remedied by considerable repairs. Copies of the orders were accordingly served on Mrs. Sophia Day, with notice of the time when the Vestry would hear objections. On the day appointed, Mr. Sidney Benham, Solicitor, of 60, Chancery Lane, appeared, stating that he represented the husband of Mrs. Day, to whom this house had belonged, but who died two days before, leaving no will, and that the husband would administer to the estate. He also stated that the work specified in the Surveyor's report had been done six weeks ago, which, however, the Medical Officer of Health and Surveyor denied. The Vestry, thereupon, made an order for the works specified in the Surveyor's report to be carried out within one month. Housing of the Labouring Classes. — In December, 1889, the Vestry received a letter from the President of the Local Government Board, calling attention to the question of the housing of the labouring classes, and to the powers conferred upon the Vestry by the Metropolis Local Management Act, the Nuisance. Removal Act, the Sanitary Act, the Artizans' Dwellings Acts, for dealing with the subject. The subject was referred to the Sanitary Committee, who carefully considered it, and upon their recommendation the Local Government Board were informed that the Acts referred to in their circular letter have been long since acted upon by the Vestry. Broad Yard, Turnmill Street.—Representations have been made to the Vestry by Messrs. Condy & Mitchell, and Messrs. Murray & Co., of Turnmill 24 Street., of the insecurity of their property abutting upon Broad Yard, by reason of the peculiar construction of Broad Yard, which effectually secludes it from observation from the street, and they also made the suggestion that a gate should be erected at the entrance for the purpose of shutting it off from Turnmill Street at night after business hours. The Yestry gave consent to the erection of the gate but, with the view of safeguarding the public rights in the Court, required that they should be furnished with a key of the gate, and that a tablet should be affixed to the adjoining premises giving notice that the Court was public property. These requirements have been complied with, and the gate erected accordingly. Chalet, Clerkenwell Road—This structure having been allowed by the Chalet Company, Limited, to become a source of great nuisance and annoyance to the surrounding inhabitants from its neglected condition, the Yestry considered the question of its removal, although it was standing in the Parish of Charterhouse. It appeared that such Parish had no funds which they could apply to the removal of the structure, and that this Yestry would not be authorised to remove it, seeing that it is not in the Parish of Clerkenwell, although they, by a mistake as to the boundary, granted permission for its erection, and they, therefore, requested the authorities of the Charterhouse to empower this Yestry to remove it. After considerable correspondence with the Charterhouse Vestry they gave the Yestry the necessary authority, and the structure was removed. Colney Hatch Lane, Sewerage.—Last year's Report on this subject closed with a statement that the Vestry had called upon the Hornsey Local Board to open up the outlet of a barrel drain existing 25 ??? the lower part of Colney Hatch Lane, which Would then discharge into the ditch on the Hornsey ??? of the road, and thence into a brook in the ???. To this the Hornsey Board replied that they could not open up the outlet without committing a ??? on private property, and that the drain in ??? was not put in by them but apparently ??? the landowners on the Clerkenwell side. The storm-water drain, suggested by the Hornsey Local Board for dealing with the surface water of Colney Hatch Lane, has been constructed at the Expense of the Yestry, but little progress has been made in the negociations between the Hornsey Board, the County Council, and the Yestry for the ??? of the outlying part of the Parish. Every ??? made by Hornsey has been conceded, xcept one—that the Yestry should furnish a plan ??? wing how the drainage of the remaining part of the ??? is disposed of. Beyond the general knowledge ??? it is drained into the Tottenham system, the Vestry has no information, and can therefore furnish ???, and the negociation with Hornsey came to a ???. The Yestry, therefore, approached ??? of the contiguous Boards—that of Friern ???, and an interview with that Board resulted ??? their agreeing to take the sewage for the period ??? 30 years at an annual charge of £100 until the ??? value of the houses amounted to £2,000, ??? 1s. in the £ on any value in excess of that sum. The Yestry have therefore asked the County Council ??? ratify and give effect to this proposal. Crawford Passage.—The Yestry, in September, 1889, received a letter from Mr. F. Gr. Underhay, of ???, Crawford Passage, suggesting that, if the nairow passage by the side of the old Workhouse site were sufficiently widened to allow of a roadway being 26 constructed, the property lying at the back would be opened up, and a great part of his buildings, which have been lying empty since they were built, would stand a chance of being let, producing a return to him for a large outlay, and rates to the Parish for property which has for many years pro. duced nothing, and that a very small width of the old Workhouse site, which is Parish property, would be necessary to effect the improvement. The matter was very carefully considered, but the Yestry came to the conclusion that, having regard to the very steep gradients (1 in 8 and 1 in 20),it was not practicable to form a useful carriageway at the spot. Anticipated Nuisance from Fair in rear of Pentonville Road.—In September, 1889, the Yestry received letters from several inhabitants of Pentonville Road, between Winchester Street and North Street, complaining that a piece of vacant ground in the rear of their premises has been let for the purpose of erecting swings and roundabouts, and asking the Yestry's assistance in putting a stop thereto. The Yestry referred the matter to their Solicitors to take such steps to prevent the nuisance as the law allows. The Solicitors reported that it was doubtful whether the Fair was a public nuisance, and it would be difficult to suppress without the assistance and evidence of the occupiers of the adjacent premises, any of whom could take proceedings to stop the Fair as a private nuisance; and that it was a question for a Jury whether a fair of that nature amounted to a public nuisance, which could only be decided after a long trial at Quarter Sessions, and at considerable expense. They further reported 27 that they had caused notices to be served upon the owner of the land and the person who appeared to be in charge of the Fair, but had not yet been able to ascertain the name or the description of the proprietor; and that they also attended at the places of business of the persons who had complained of the Fair, but, upon explaining the difficulties in the way of the Yestry proceeding, and suggesting the simpler method of one of the inhabitants commencing a civil action, claiming an injunction to restrain the Fair from being held, they had replied that they had no time to spare, and could not take the matter up; and upon it being pointed out that if the Yestry took action it would be necessary for them to attend to give evidence, they replied that they could not give any time to the matter. Under these circumstances it was obviously useless for the Yestry to incur the great expense involved in the suggested proceedings. Guildhall Library.—In December, 1889, the Yestr}' received a letter from Mr. W. P. Treloar, of 68, Ludgate Hill, asking the opinion of the Vestry on a proposal to open the Guildhall Library Museum and Ait Gallery during some portion of Sunday, and they passed a resolution cordially supporting any movement for such opening. A discussion took place on the subject at the Court of Common Council on the 3Cth January, on a motion by Mr. Treloar, but "the previous question " was moved and carried by 83 to 43. New River Company's Grounds.— In June, 1889, a suggestion was made to the Yestry by Mr. H. E. Davis, proprietor of the North London Palace of Yarieties (late Deacon's Music Hall), suggesting that the Yestry should petition the New River 28 Company to substitute an iron railing for the high wall now enclosing their lake and grounds at New River Head. The Vestry, however, did not feel themselves to be in a position to make such a request. The same gentleman subsequently intimated to the Vestry that he had heard that the Company, if asked by the Vestry, were prepared to open their grounds for two afternoons weekly to the parishioners and public generally. The Vestry accordingly forwarded such request to the Company, but received a reply stating that it is net one to which they could consent. Among other reasons against the proposal being the fact that the enclosure consists chiefly of a number of deep ponds, with paths between and around them of very limited width only, rendering it unsuitable for the purpose of a public promenade. Royal Academy of Arts.—With reference to the request of the Vestry, mentioned in last year's report, to the Royal Academy to open their Art Galleries on Saturday evenings at an entrance fee of 6d., the Vestry received a letter from the President and Council expressing their regret that, after giving the matter their very careful consideration, they fouud there are certain difficulties of a practical character which render it, in their opinion, not possible to comply with the request. The Vestry expressed regret that the Council could not see their way to opening the Academy on Saturday evenings at a reduced charge, considering that they so open it now during the last six evenings of the Exhibition, and that the difficulties which would apply to the one case would apparently apply to the other; and they requested the 29 dent and Council to receive a deputation on the subject. The Council of the Academy replied, however, that their decision was unanimously arrived at after very careful deliberation, and that they were unable to comply with the request of the Yestry to give the subject any further consideration, and they therefore declined to receive the Deputation. New Street from Gray's Inn Road to Saint John Street Road.—The Report last year closed with the record of the reception of a letter from the Metropolitan Board of Works that the portion of the new street, which will be between Mount Pleasant and St. John Street Road, will be made of the width of 60 feet instead of 50 feet. The Yestry appointed a Deputation to wait upon the Members of Parliament for Finsbury and South Islington with reference to the further proposed delay in carrying out the work, but in the first place instructed the Deputation to wait upon the London County Council to urge that the thoroughfare should also be made 60 feet wide between Mount Pleasant and the Holborn Town Hall, and invited the co-operation of the Holborn District Board of Works in the matter, to which the District Board consented. Mr. F. A. Ford, one of the representatives of the Parish at the London County Council, being present at the Yestry Meeting on the 6th June, was asked to urge the County Council to proceed with the formation of the new street as speedily as possible, in view of the great annoyance and injury to the interests of the inhabitants along the line of route, in consequence of the great delay which has taken place in carrying out this desirable improvement. 30 The following Memorial was forwarded to the Council:— NEW STEEET FROM HOLBOEN TOWN HALL to ST. JOHN STEEET EOAD, NEAE THE "ANGEL." TO THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. The Memorial of the Vtstry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Eespectfully Sheweth: That your Memorialists are the Local Authority constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act, and represent a population of some 70,000 Inhabitants. That this very desirable improvement, by a slightly different route, was first proposed in 1877, and in the year 1885 an Act was parsed, called the Metropolitan Board of Works (Various Powers) Act, aulliorising the formation of a New Street from the Holborn Town Hall to near the "Angel," Islington. That much delay has taken place in carrying out this work, and the inhabitants along the line of route, and the neighbourhood, have suffered great annoyance and injury to their interests owing to the uncertainty of tenure caused by such delay, and their consequent inability to make progress with their domestic and business arrangements. The London County Council are therefore urged to complete the first portion of the Street to Farringdon Eoad as quickly as possible, and to expedite the formation of the remaining portion, commencing at both ends. That your Memorialists would further urge that considering the large amount of traffic which is likely to use the street, such street should be 60 feet wide from end to end, and that there should also be a sub-way for Gas and Water Mains, &c. That with regard to providing for displaced Artizans, &c, your Memorialists would point out that the remaining portion of the line of route is not so densely populated as was the first portion. That your Memorialists urge that any Bill in Parliament to authorise an extension of time for carrying out this work should be strenuously opposed. Your Memorialists append hereto a copy of the correspondence which has recently taken place between the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject, to which your 31 Memorialists refer you, and which, in their opinion, renders further argument here unnecessary. Your Memorialists therefore respectfully urge that the London County Council will be pleased to take all the facts into their serious consideration, and to receive a .Deputation in support of the same. And your Memorialists will ever pray, Sealed with the Common Seal of the Vestry. By Order of the Board of the 23rd May, 1889, ROBEET PAGET, Vestry Clerk. The following reply uas received from the Council:— London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W., 25th June, 1889. Sir, The Improvements Committee have had before them your letters of the 27th ultimo, and 17th inst., asking that a Deputation from the Vestry of Clerkenwell may be received by the Council, with reference to the width of the new street from Clerkenwell Road to Islington, and the desirability of the work being pushed on with as little delay as possible, and transmitting a memorial on the subject. In reply, the Committee have directed me to acquaint you, for the information of the Vestry, that the Council has determined, if it can be done at a moderate cost, that an increased width of ten feet shall be provided between Laystall Street and Coldbath Square, and I am to add that the Secretary of State, with whom the Council has been in communication in reference to the question of re-housing the labouring classes displaced, has signified his approval of such increased width. With regard to the works of the improvement, I am to state that all possible despatch is being used in the preparation of the plans for the construction of the Viaduct, and that the Vestry may be assured that no avoidable delay will take place in the carrying out of the improvement. Under these circumstances I am to suggest that the Vestry may perhaps think it unnecessary to send a deputation, but should. 32 they still desire to do so, the Committee will be happy to receive it as soon as the state of business before them will permit. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. De la HOOKE, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk of the Vestry of Clerkenwell, 58, Rosoman Street, E.C. The Vestry, however, informed the Council that they would prefer that the Deputation should appear before the Council. The attention of the Vestry was drawn to the following Minute of the Improvement Committee of the Council of the 29th May, which had been adopted by the Council:— 1.—Your Committee have to report that their attention has been directed to the desirability of giving some additional width to the new street from Clerkenwell Eoad to Islington, at the entrance to it from Clerkenwell Eoad. The Council will remember that it has already been decided to increase the width, if it can be done at a moderate cost, of the portion which lies between Laystall Street and Coldbath Square, from 50 to 60 feet. It will not be possible to ohtain so great an addition as this in the portion to which your Committee now refer, but they find that there is a strip of land 3 feet in width next Cavendish Buildings, which was disposed of by the late Metropolitan Board, when it was decided by that body that the new street should be only 50 feet wide, and which your Committee think it desirable the Council should acquire for the purpose of adding it to the public way. They, therefore, recommend—That the Council do purchase the strip of land in question. A letter was received on the 4th July, from Mr. King, of 4, Eliza Place, stating that No. 3, Eliza Place was in the hands of the County Council; and that after the tenant had been got rid of, a board had been put up for the property to be let; that particulars had been sent for, and he found the Council would let for twelve months, and calling attention to the delay to which the fact points. 33 The Vestry asked the County Council whether the statements made in such letter were true, and received a reply that the statement was incorrect. In July, 1889, a letter was received from Mr. Lill, of 13, Tysoe Street, suggesting that the Council should be supplied with statistics as to the number of empty houses and empty rooms in the parish, as he believed that such statistics would show that sufficient accommodation already existed for the persons who would be displaced on the line of route. The Vestry accordingly directed that the suggested information should be obtained as far as possible and forwarded to the London County Council, Earl Compton, M.P., and Mr. F. A. Ford. On the 24th July, the Deputation waited upon the Committee of the London County Council, when Mr. Johnson was appointed to address the Committee, on behalf of the Deputation, in support of the Memorial. He submitted five points for the consideration of the Committee, viz.:—(1) That the present portion of the street between Holborn Town Hall and Coldbath Square be completed at once ; (2) That the remaining portion from Farringdon Road to the "Angel" be proceeded with as soon as possible ; (3) That the road be 60 feet wide from end to end; (4) That there be a subway; and (5) That any application to Parliament to delay the carrying out of the work be opposed, as set forth in the Memorial. The replies of the County Council Committee were that they were getting out tenders for the viaduct; but the seoond point they rather evaded. With regard to the third point that the roadway be 60 feet from end to end, the County Council proposed to buy from the Cavendish Buildings the 3 ft. strip of land, which would be an eyesore to the parish, and then the carriageway would be one uniform width of 36 ft. The Council 34 had pointed out to the Deputation that, under the Act of Parliament, not more than 20 buildings could be demolished at a time without making provision for the people displaced, and this, therefore, was the argument against the completion of the road before the erection of other dwellings. The Committee, by the way, denied the assertion that the houses at Eliza Place, Sadler's Wells, which would have to come down for the new street, were being re-let for twelve months certain. Coldbath Fields Prison Wall — Widening Farringdon Road.—In June, 1889, the Vescry received a letter from Mr. Blashill, the Superintending Architect of the London County Council, stating that he had been informed by Mr. M. Tanner, of the Office of H.M. Work3 and Public Buildings, that the existing wall enclosing the site of Coldbath Fields Prison, at the corner of Calthorpe Street and Farringdon Road, is about to be rebuilt, and Mr. Tanner had enquired whether the Council wished to carry out any improvement at the corner by setting back the wall. Mr. Blashill stated that the Council had no powers for the purpose, but that he had informed Mr. Tanner that the suggestion would be communicated to the Yestry. After careful consideration of such letter, the Yestry decided to inform the County Council that, in the opinion of this Yestry, it was very desirable that the Prison wall, on the Farringdon Road side, should be set back for widening the Road, and that, considering the already increased vehicular traffic caused by the Post Office Establishment, the Postal authorities should give the necessary space for such widening. The Vestry's views having been communicated also to the First Commissioner of Works and the PostmasterGeneral, a letter was received in July from the 35 former, stating that the original enquiry extended only to a suggested improvement at the corner of Calthorpe Street, and that it would be impossible to add much to the street in the manner proposed. He also asked that before the matter was further considered he might be furnished with a plan showing the proposals of the Yestry. He further stated that the Post Office traffic would be mainly provided for within the walls of the disused prison, and that any land that might be thrown into the street would have to be acquired by the Local authorities by purchase from the Postmaster-General. The Yestry thereupon directed that a plan showing a uniform width of 60 feet, from Calthorpe Street to 179, Farringdon Road, by setting back the wall of the prison, be prepared and forwarded to the First Commissioner of Works. About this time, however, the Post Office Sites Bill was introduced into Parliament to set at rest certain doubts which had arisen as to the validity of the transfer of the site of the Prison to the Post Office Authorities, and the following communication was received from the Clerkenwell United Ratepayers' Protection Society :— The Clerkenwell United Ratepayers' Protection Society, 33, Wharton Street, W.C., July 3rd, 1889. Dear Sir, Referring to the Government proposal to take over, for the purposes of the Post Office, the site formerly occupied by the House of Correction, and the opposition thereto, on the part of a minority of the ratepayers, in favour of the conversion of the said site into an open space, I am required to ask you to be good enough to lay before your Yestry the fact that my Society is strongly in favour of the space being taken over by the Postal Authorities, in view of the great amount of local prosperity which would thereby be caused by the bringing into the Parish of a large working and occupying population in partial substitution of the loss of trade entailed by the withdrawal of the warders, etc. Further, the population of Clerkenwell is steadily decreasing and 36 its staple trade declining, so that it becomes more difficult each year for the parish to support its poor. I further beg to point out that, in proportion to the inhabitants, the open spaces, recreation grounds, &c., are already sufficient, including as they do:—Claremont, Wilmington, Holford, Lloyd, Myddelton, and Northampton Sqnares, Green Terrace, Percy Circus, New River Co's Grounds, Clerkenwell Green, Spa Fields, the number of School Boards playgrounds, and open spaces and playgrounds of the various Industrial Dwellings Blocks. Taking the foregoing into consideration, it is earnestly hoped that the Vestry will not consent to deprive local prosperity of this proffered benefit, and will refuse to have this splendid business site converted into an unneeded resort. I am, Dear Sir, Faithfully yours, JOHN I. RUNACRES, Secretary. The Yestry were in accord with the views contained in the foregoing letter, and resolved to present a petition in favour of the Bill, and acquainted the Members of Parliament for the Metropolitan Boroughs with their views. The following Petition was therefore prepared and presented:— In Parliament—Session, 1889. To the Honorable the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, in the Countj of London. Sheweth: That your Petitioners are the local authority constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. That your Petitioners have had their attention called to a Bill now before your honourable House, entitled the Post Office Sites Bill, providing that in order to secure adequate accommodation for the Post Office, the site of the disused prison in Coldbath Fields shall be acquired by the Postmaster-General. That all but a small portion of such site at the North West corner is in the Parish of Clerkenwell. 37 That your Petitioners have for a long time past been conscious of the fact that the trades of the Parish have been in a very depressed state, and that the alteration in the social status of the inhabitants which has been going on has tended to increase this depression, and they are convinced that the parishioners could ill afford to lose the custom and support of the great number of warders who were employed in Coldbath Fields Prison and the House of Detention, but who left the Parish when these prisons were closed, while in addition the rates suffered considerably by the loss of the Government contribution in aid, which ceased also when the Prison was closed. That your Petitioners therefore in the proposal of the Govern ment see the prospect of the restoration of a portion of this loss by the immigration of a large number of Post Office employes and the erection of Government Property, on which contributions in aid of the rates would be paid. That your Petitioners are aware that it is being urged that the site should be set apart as an open space for the benefit of the inhabitants, but your Petitioners desire to point out that there already exist in close proximity to the prison site eight squares and open spaces, viz.:—Claremont, Wilmington, Holford, Lloyd, Myddelton and Northampton Squares, Green Terrace and Percy Circus, Clerkenwell Green, and open spaces and playgrounds of the various Industrial Dwellings' blocks, besides the large open area of the New River Company's premises, the Board School playgrounds and Spa Fields Burial Ground, and your Petitioners very humbly submit that in proportion to its area the Parish of Clerkenwell is very fairly supplied with open spaces. Your Petitioners therefore very humbly but very earnestly pray that your Honorable House will allow the said Bill to pass into law. And Your Petitioners will ever pray. Sealed with the Common Seal of the Vestry, by Order of the Vestry, this 4th day of July, 1889. ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. Captain Penton, M.P., attended the Yestry on the 18th July, and stated that, in taking the course he had in endeavouring to secure the site as an open space, he imagined that he was acting as the Yestry would desire, seeing that on February 14th, 1887, he headed a Deputation of the Vestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had for its D 35 object the setting apart of the site as an open space,* but that as the Yestry had now arrived at a different conclusion he should do his best to support the Post Office Sites Bill. A Special Meeting of the Yestry was held on the 15th August, when the following letters were read:— House of Commons, 6'h August, 1889. My Dear Sir, When about a fortnight ago I attended a meeting of the Clerkenwell Vestry to make a statement on the subject of the Coldbath Fields Prison Site, the Vestry seecned unanimonsly of opinion that it was desirable that the Farringdon Road should be widened at the point where some houses now stand called Oldham Gardens. I took an early opportunity of seeing Mr. Raikes, who explained to me that he did not think it possible to do much in the way of widening the street at that point, as under present circumstances accommodation was afforded for most of the Parcels Post Traffic inside the walls, which could not be the case if the wall was moved back any distance. He subsequently informed me that this matter would form a portion of the questions to be decided by the Committee to which the Bill has been relegated since it passed the second reading. It occurs to me that the Vestry ought to be represented before the Committee by some one empowered to give evidence on their behalf, but doubtless the Vestry have been communicated with to that effect already. Kindly place this letter before the Vestry, and oblige. Faithfully yours, FREDERICK T. PEN TON. London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W., 6th August, 1889. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 9th ultimo, stating that in the opinion of the Vestry of Clerkenwell, it is very desirable that the wall of Coldbath Fields Prison on the Farringdon Road side, should be set back for the purpose of widening the road, 1 have to acquaint you, for the information of the Vestry, * When the Vestry advocated the retention of the site as an open spaoe, it was us nn alternative to proposals for covering the land with Artizans' Dwellings. No suggestion had been made at that time of the erection of the Parcels Poat Depôt. 39 that the Improvements Committee have passed the following Resolution, which the Deputy Chairman of the Council has been requested to communicate to the House of Commons upon the consideration of the Post Office Sites' Bill:— " That, in view of the greatly increased traffic which will be "occasioned in the event of the establishment of a Post Office " to occupy the site of the Coldbath Fields Prison, this "Committee is of opinion that it is very desirable to widen " Farringdon Road from Exmouth Street to Lower Calthorp " Street, to the extent of 10 feet, and tbat the land required for " this purpose should be obtained from the present site of the " prison." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Clerk of H. DE LA. HOOKE, The Yestry of Clerkenwell. Clerk of the Council. General Post Office, London, 9th August, 1889. Sir, The Postmaster-General has had before him your letter of the 9th ultimo, intimating that in the opinion of the Clerkenwell Yestry, it is very desirable that Farringdon Road should be widened by the setting back of the boundary wall of the old Prison premises at Coldbath Fields. Mr. Raikes has also received a Deputation of certain members of the Yestry and Ratepayers, who asked that, in view of the additional traffic thrown upon Farringdon Rond by the Post Office occupation of the Prison premises, a strip of th« frontage 10 feet wide along the whole length of the property should be given up by the Government to widen the Street. In reply, I am directed to state for the information of the Vestry and the members of the Deputation, that Mr. Ptaikes is fully alive to the importance of the question which has thus been brought before him ; he is advised, however, that there would be some difficulty in giving up the proposed strip of 10 feet in width, but that it would be sufficient if the frontage were set back so as to increase the width of the Street, which now varies in that part from about 44 feet to about 54 feet to 60 feet uniformly; and this he would be prepared, at the proper time, to recommend Her Majesty's Government to concede. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Robert Paget, Esq., S. A. BLACKWOOD. Clerkenwell Vestry Hall. 40 The Yestry then decided that a letter be written to the Postmaster-General expressing the thanks of the Yestry for the concession of a 60 feet road, forwarding the plan prepared by the Surveyor, and pointing out that the northern portion of the road is now 65 feet 6 inches wide, but should not be diminished, and that he be asked to pull down the outer wall as soon as possible. Mr. F. A. Ford, representative of Clerkenwell at the London County Council, being present, stated that while deploring that he had differed with the Yestry in trying to get an open space on the Coldbath Fields site, he ventured to think that the pressure he and others had brought to bear on the Government had been in some measure instrumental in securing the promise that had been made of threequarters of an acre being given up on the site of Oldham Gardens, or, if the County Council preferred it, a sum of ten thousand pounds, to be devoted to providing an open space in some other part. The Yestry passed votes of thanks to Captain Penton, M.P., and Mr. Ford, for the great amount of care and attention they had given to the matter. On the 22nd August, 1889, the Yestry received from the County Council the following interesting Memorandum of facts connected with the site:— LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE. Spring Gardens, S.W. 19th July, 1889. Memoranbum as to the facts connected with the site of Coldbatli-fields Prison, containing about 8½ acres. This site was acquired under an Act of the 2Gth Geo. III., chapter 55 (1786), by which the Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex were empowered to raise, and did raise, the money for purchasing the site and erecting thereon a House of 41 Correction for the County of Middlesex, such money being raised by means of annuities payable out of the county rates. The site of oldbath-fields prison was therefore purchased and the building erected thereon out of money provided by the ratepayers of the county. In 1877 the Prisons Act was passed. By that Act all prisons were vested in Her Majesty, and acquired without making any payment or compensation to the ratepayers for their previous outlay, the Government thereafter undertaking the cost of maintenance. Under the Act, the Coldbath-fields Prison and its site, about acres, was acquired by the Government from the Justices representing the ratepayers without payment or consideration. By Section 64 of the Local Government Act, 1888, the property of the Justices became vested in the London County Council, as their successors. It was not at the date of the Prisons Act contemplated to give up the sites of the prisons in the Metropolis; but being a general public act, applicable to all prisons in the country, the Act provides by Section 34, that when a prison to which the Act applies is discontinued, the Secretary of State shall offer to reconvey the same to the prison authority to which the prison originally belonged, (and of which, in the case of the Coldbathfields Prison, the London County Council are the successors), and on the terms by that section prescribed, viz., on payment of £120 in respect of each prisoner belonging to such prison authority, for whom cell accommodation was provided in such discontinued prison at the time of the passing of the Act. The Section further provides that if the prison authority decline to accept such offer, or fail to comply with the terms thereof, the prison “shall be sold by the Secretary of State, and the overplus (if any) of the proceeds of the sale, after the expenses of the sale have been paid, and the amount prescribed by the said section has been paid into the Exchequer, shall be rendered to the prison authority to which the prison originally belonged." The site and prison are still, and have always remained since the Act of 1877, subject to this direction of sale. Such a direction of sale does not appear to include a power of leasing to the Post Office or any other authority or person, or the dealing with the property other than by public sale. The interests of the ratepayers were so far guarded and recognised that any surplus arising from the sale over and above the amount, referred to and the expenses of sale, is reserved and made payable to the London County Council as representing the ratepayers. The report of the Royal Commission on the Housing of the 42 Working Classes of 1885 contained the following recommendation:— "They would suggest that the sites now occupied by the Millbank, Coldbath-fields, and Pentonville prisons should be conveyed to the Metropolitan Board of "Works, in trust for the benefit of those portions of the town which are most overcrowded. In fixing the price at which the sites should be so conveyed, due regard should be had to the purposes for which they are so required. To carry into effect the object of securing additional land where most required in the metropolis for building room for workmen's dwellings, and for open spates connected there with, power should be given, previous to their acqursitun by the Metropolitan Board of Works, to sell or exchange, with the approval of the Home Office, any portion of the sites referred to, that the areas obtained instead should be devoted in proportions, to be fixed by the confirming authority, to these uses and to no other." If the Justices had thought fit to re purchase, then, by section 3 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, it was lawful for them to sell and convey the respective sites, or any part or parts thereof, to the Metropolitan Board of Works, at a fair market price. Under the circumstances, hereafter stated, these provisions were not called into existence, as the Justices declined to purchase under the Act of 1877, and the direction to the Secretary of State to sell, under the Act of 1877, and pay the surplus to the ratepayers, still, therefore, remains in full force. Although the Justices declined to re-purchase, Mr. Lushington on behalf of the Secretary of State, wrote on the 26th April, 1886, to the late Metropolitan Board of Worts, referring to the provisions of the above-mentioned third section of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, and stating that provision had, in consequence of the Justices having declined to accept these sites, now become, strictly speaking, inoperative, but that Mr. Childers was desirous that the question of the expediency of utilizing these sites for the erection of dwellings for the working classes should not on that account be put aside, and requesting that the Metropolitan Board of Works would inform the Secretary of State whether there was any likelihood of the Board being willing to enter into a negociation with the Prison Commissioners for the purchase of these two sites, or either of them, with a view to their appropriation to the erection of dwellings for the working classes, such purchase to be made at a price somewhat lower than the full value which might be expected from a sale of the sites by auction. On the 8th June, 1886, the Clerk of the Board wrote to Mr. Lushington, declining to purchase for the purpose mentioned, on 43 the ground that the Board had set apart several pieces of ground within a very short distance of the prisons as sites for improved dwellings for the working classes. The letter proceeded as follows:— "There is one suggestion, however, which the Board takes the present opportunity of offering for the consideration of the Secretary of State. The neighbourhood of Clerkenwell is thickly populated, and it would be a benefit to the inhabitants if, when the prison buildings are pulled down, a portion of the ground could be set apart and preserved as an open space. This course was taken by the Surrey Magistrates when Horsemonger-lane Gaol was closed, and the open ground is of great value, particularly to the children of the poor inhabitants of the neighbourhood." "The Vestry of Clerkenwell is strongly of opinion that some portion of the ground should be preserved as an open space, and the Board ventures to ask the Secretary of State to give to this suggestion his favourable consideration." At the date of this letter, the provisions in the 1877 Act directed the Secretary of State to sell, applying the surplus (if any) to the ratepayers' relief. No reply was sent to the suggestion as to the dedication of the land as an open space, and no further action seems to have been taken by the present Home Secretary till February 1887, after a petition had been presented on the 14th January, 1887, to the late Metropolitan Board of Works by the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. The necessity for securing an open space is thus stated in the memorial:- "The parish of Clerkenwell, containing nearly 70,000 inhabitants, consists of 880 acres, showing an average of about 785 per acre, whilst in St. George's, Hanover Square, the population per acre is about 85, or Paddington 91, Kensington 74, Hampstead 20, and Hackney 47." “That Clerkenwell is therefore, and from its situation, must always continue to be, a densely populated parish, and is surrrounded by other crowded parishes, for instance, St. Luke's, Holborn, and St. Pancras." “That there are at the present time a great number of model dwellings in the parish, containing over 1,200 tenements, providing accommodation for a population of between 6,000 and 7,000, with no provision for open playgrounds for children, except in the Peabody Buildings." “That other parts of London have their open spaces, whilst the crowded district of Clerkenwell is absolutely 44 without any such open space, beyond the several ordinary squares in the parish, and the inhabitants have a long way to go to reach an open space such as moat other parts of the metropolis enjoy." In consequence of the presentation of this Petition, on the 24th February, 1887, the Home Secretary stated in the House of Commons, in answer to a question by Captain Penton (Member for Finsbury, Central Divison), that “any proposal, either from “the Metropolitan Board of Works or from the Clerkenwell “Vestry, for the retention of a portion of the site of the Coldbath “Fields Prison as an open space will receive my careful “attention." Notwithstanding the letter of the Board of the 8th June, 188G, and the Home Secretary's statement in the House of Commons on the 24th February, 1887, it appears from Mr. Raikes' statement, made in answer to Mr. Lawson in the House of Commons on the 8th July, 1889, that against the provisions of section 34 of the Prisons Act, 1877, which requires the prison to bo sold, and the overplus, if any, after tho expenses of the sale have been paid, and the statutory amount prescribed by the said section have been paid into the Exchequer, to be rendered to tho prison authorities to which the prison originally belonged, and of which the London Council are the successors, "the Post Office com“menced taking possession of the old prison premises at Coldbath “Fields in August, 1887, and tho whole of the site and buildings “are now occupied for Post Office purposes, except a small strip “at the south-eastern corner, which has been sold to the ( ounty “Council to widen the street. Tho Department has already, “with the sanction of Parliament, expended about £14,000 on “the premises." An illustration of the inexpediency of not proceeding to ascertain the value by submitting so large an area as 8½ acres of building land to public auction, is to bo found in the case of Westminster Prison, the site of which, covering 8½ acres, was re-purchased by the Justices for the sum of £68,155 4s., and was, within a month, re-sold for £115,000, and again, within a very short time afterwards, one-half of the area was sold for £115,000. The pending Post Office Sites Bill is introduced to confirm what appears to be an illegal transaction, and to alter the provisions of the Act of 1877 which directed a sale. The Bill recites the Prisons Act of 1877, that no sale has been made, but that arrangements have been made for the sale of a portion of the prison land for the purpose of improving the adjoining streets at a price proportionate to the value of the whole, and for the transfer of the residue of the prison to the Postmaster-General; that doubts have arisen as to the validity of such sale and transfer 45 as aforesaid without a sale of the whole of the prison being first made by the Secretary of state; and the Act proposes by the 2nd section to vest the prison in the Postmaster-General, freed and discharged from all claims, interests, rights and demands of or on behalf of the Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, or for the County of London, or any other person or body corporate whatsoever. The recommendations of the Report on the Housing of the Poor will be thus disregarded; an open space for the adjoining artizans' dwellings will be lost: and the ratepayers' interest in any surplus arising after a sale will also be disregarded, if the proposed Bill passes into law. The Post Office Sites Act received the Royal Assent on the 30th August, 1889, and contained the following clause:— “If the London County Council shall at any time, within six months after the passing of this Act, give notice in writing to the PostmasterGeneral that they desire to purchase for the purpose of an open space that portion of the Coldbath Fields Prison which is coloured green on the plan in this Act referred to, the Postmaster-General shall sell for the purpose aforesaid, such portion of the said prison to the London County Council at a price bearing the same proportion to one hundred thousand pounds as the portion coloured green bears to the whole of the said prison, or the Postmaster-General may in his discretion in lieu of selling such portion as aforesaid, pay to the London County Council the sum of ten thousand pounds to be expended by the said Council in providing open spaces." At the Meeting of the Vestry on the 31st October, the following communications were read;— London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W., 26th October, 1889. Sir, The Improvements Committee of this Council have been in communication with the Postmaster-General on the subject of 46 a suggested widening of Farringdon Road, where it passes the site of Coldbath Fields Prison, and I am directed to forward, for the information of the Vestry of Clerkenwell, the enclosed copy of a letter received from the Post Office upon the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant H. DE LA. HOOKE, To the Clerk of the Clerk to the Council. Vestry of Clerkenwell. General Post Office, London, 7th October, 1889, Sir, In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, No. 8817—C. 1, 10. I am directed to state, for the information of the London County Council, that the Postmaster-General has for some time been in communication with the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, with reference to representations which have been made to him by that body, as to the necessity for widening Farringdon Road by setting back the wall of the Old Coldbath Fields Prison, and he has now under consideration a proposal for removing the present wall between Oldham Gardens and Calthorpe Street, and erecting instead a dwarf wall with iron railings, so as to enlarge the street to a width of 00 feet. I am to add that Mr. Raikes assumes that the local authorities will be prepared to purchase the land which would thus be thrown into the street. I am, &c , G. W. SMYTH, H. De La Hooke, Esq., For Secretary. Clerk to the London County Council. In reply to the foregoing, the County Council were informed that the Vestry are strongly in favour of the widening of the road, but are not prepared to purchase the land thrown into the road as assumed by the Postmaster-General, and at a subsequent Meeting on the 28th November directed that the attention of the Postmaster-General be called to his letter of the 15th August (see above), in which he said he should be prepared to recommend the Government to concede the necessary land to widen the roadway to 60 feet. 47 The following correspondence thereupon ensued: Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, December 5th, 1889. Sir, Widening Farringdon Road. The Vestry have received from the London County Council a letter addressed to that body by yourself, under date of the 7th October last, upon the above subject, in which it is stated that the Postmaster-General assumes that the local authorities will be prepared to purchase the land necessary for widening the roadway to 60 feet. In connection therewith I am to recall your attention to your letter of the 9th August last upon the same subject, addressed to this Vestry, in which you state that at the proper time the Postmaster-General would be prepared to recommend the Government to concede sufficient land for the purpose. The Vestry have always considerd that letter to mean that, in view of the additional traffic thrown upon the road by the Post Office occupation of the prison premises, the land was to be given up by the Post Office, and they are somewhat surprised now to learn that it is expected that the land will be purchased. The Vestry will be glad to hear that your letter to the Council of the 7th October was written as the result of a temporary oversight of your letter to the Vestry af the 9th August. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, ROBERT PAGET, Sir S. A. Blackwood, K.C.B., Vestry Clerk. Secretary, General Post Office. General Post Office, Sir, 10th December, 1889. In reply to your letter of the 5th inst., relative to the proposed widening of Farringdon Road between Mount Pleasant and Calthorpe Street, I have to inform you that the concession mentioned in my letter of the 9th August last, as that which the Postmaster-General would be prepared to recommend, applied to the giving up of the use of the land required, and the consequent curtailment of the Post Office yard. It was not intended to imply that the land would be transferred to the Local Authorities free of cost. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, S. A. BLACKWOOD. Robert Paget, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Clerkenwell, E.C. 48 The Vestry then directed that a copy of the correspondence be forwarded to Captain Penton, M.P., and that he be asked to see the Postmaster-General thereon; and they received from him the following letter:— Chalfont Park, Slough, 29th January, 1890. My Dear Sir, In accordance with my telegram of Monday, I went to town yesterday to try and get an interview with the PostmasterGeneral. Unfortunately Mr. Raikes was out of town, and does not, I am informed, return till this morning. I was able, however, through the courtesy of Mr. Raikes private Secretary, to see the official who has the matters referred to in the correspondence which you sent to me in hand. From him I learnt that the Post Office authorities, in using the expression “concede” which occurs in Sir Arthur Blackwood's letter of the 9th August, to which reference has been made, had in view the giving up of the land in question to the local authorities, but never contemplated conceding it free of cost: that the value of the land, roughly speaking, is estimated at about £970: that the question of whether the land shall be paid for or transferred free of cost is entirely at the discretion of the Post Office and Treasury Authorities, and that there is no precedent for such a transfer without payment: finally that the Vestry and ratepayers have not as yet, in the opinion of the Postmaster-General, shown any sufficient cause to justify him in making the gratuitous concession demanded. Under these circumstances I should suggest, if I may be allowed to do so, that the Vestry Clerk be direoted to write again to the Postmaster-General, either setting forth more fully the reasons which the Vestry have to urge in favour of the concession asked for, or else if that be not deemed satisfactory, asking Mr. Raikes to receive another deputation at an early date. I should like to say that, in the event of the Vestry choosing the latter alternative, I shall be happy to go with the deputation, should my presence be considered to be of any use. I am, my dear Sir, Faithfully yours, FREDK. T. PENTON. To R. Paget, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Clerkenwell. The Vestry thereupon decided that the 49 master-General be asked to receive a deputation at an early date, and that Captain Penton, Earl Compton and Mr. F. A. Ford be asked to accompany such deputation. The deputation waited upon the PostmasterGeneral by appointment on the 18th February, at the House of Commons, being introduced by Captain Penton, M.P. The deputation consisted of Mr. Eobson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kellaway, Mr. Sans, Mr. Brighty, Mr. Shilton, and Mr. Kelly, and it was joined by Mr. F. A. Ford. Mr. Robson addressed the Postmaster-General, and urged that the widening was largely rendered necessary by the Post Office traffic, and that the Post Office being a National Institution, the local authorities should not be called upon to pay for the land necessary for such widening. Mr. Raikes received the deputation very favourably, and promised that the matter should be properly laid before the Treasury. With reference to the provision in the Post Office Sites Act, the Vestry have reason to believe that the London County Council are negociating with the Postmaster-General for the purchase of the freehold of Oldham Gardens for £8000, for the purpose of converting it into an open space; and at the close of the period embraced by this report the Vestry were considering whether there is any portion of the Parish which it is desirable to acquire as an open space, with the view to acquire same with the sum of £10,000 to be paid by the Government in respect of Coldbath Fields Prison, and to report thereon, if the Oldham Gardens' site is retained. St. James' Churchyard.-In last year's Report it was stated that considerable progress had been made in the formal steps necessary for converting the disused Churchyard of the Parish Church of St. 50 James into an open space. In Jane, 1889, the Petition for a faculty to lay out the Churchyard as a garden and for widening the roadway of St. James' Walk at its junction with Clerkenwell Green, by setting back the wall of the Churchyard, was heard by the Judge of the Consistory Court, and the prayer of the Petition was granted subject to certain conditions with regard to two or three of the graves belonging to persons, who appeared and objected to the order being made. The Vestry thus being in a position to carry out the improvement, invited tenders for the work, and accepted that of Mr. G. Bell, of Tottenham Hale, for £948, and the work is now in progress. In regard to the laying out of the Churchyard, the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association offered some time ago to contribute £100 the cost, provided the work was done within a specified time. It was found impossible to comply with this condition; but a further request has been made to the Association, who have contributed £50 to the cost, and offered to provide seats to the value of a further £50. The Vestry have asked the County Council to contribute half the total cost, but have not at present had a reply to their letter. Spa Fields Burial Ground.—In August 1889, the Vestry received a letter from the Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the London County Council asking the views of the Vestry respecting the maintenance of Spa Fields Burial Ground as an open space for the recreation of the public; as to whether they think it of public use, and whether they will bear the cost of maintenance, and if not, whether they will contribute towards the Council doing so, and to what extent. But as it appeared 51 that the ground was at present maintained by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, the Vestry replied that they were satisfied with the present arrangements. In November the Vestry received a further letter from the County Council, stating that they were informed that the Metropolitan Public Gardens' Association propose to close Spa Fields Burial Ground for want of funds, and renewing their questions as to the Vestry's willingness to maintain or partly maintain it. The Vestry therefore wrote to the Metropolitan Public Gardens' Association for information as to cost of maintenance, &c., and received a reply that their annual cost of maintenance was about £60, but that if the Council were to take it over, it would probably be rather more, as the wages given to the caretaker would be somewhat higher, and that the only other expenses included in the above figures connected with the ground are gravelling, and repairs to gymnastic apparatus, which vary slightly from year to year. The subiect having been considered, the Vestry informed the County Council that, having relieved the Metropolitan Public Gardens' Association of Wilmington and Northampton Squares, they were not prepared to take over this ground. Wilmington and Northampton Squares.— These enclosures, taken over by the Vestry in July, 1887, continue to be largely resorted to by the dwellers in the thickly populated parts of the parish. The cost of the squares for the year is as follows:— For Wilmington Square £108 0 10 Northampton Square 107 9 3 £215 10 1 52 Coal and Wine Dues.—In the Session of 1889 the vexed question of the continuance or otherwise of the London Coal dues was at last settled. Two Bills dealing with the matter were submitted to Parliament, one by Mr. Baring and Sir R. Fowler, which proposed to continue the statutory duty of thirteen pence per ton. The Vestry, in common with many other rating authorities of the Metropolis, petitioned in favour of this measure, being of opinion that the dues were of a nature almost unnoticed by the groat bulk of the population, and foreseeing that the abolition of the duty could not benefit the poorer classes of the community, who buy coal in small quantities, and that the amount would in all probability bo absorbed by the middleman, the ordinary householder getting a higher taxation, with no relief in his coal bill. The Government, however, announced that it would take no steps to continue the dues unless the London Comity Council desired it, and the Council decided not to seek a continuance of them, and therefore no opportunity could be found to take the judgment of the House upon the Bill. In July the statutory duty of thirteen ponce would have died a natural death, and it was understood that the City intended to levy certain dues by the enforcement of prescriptive and chartered rights, which they held were merely suspended by the Act of 1831. Sir J. Poaso, in May, moved the second reading of a measure abolishing any dues that were leviable by the Corporation after tho expiration of their statutory powers in July, but assented to a proposal of Mr. W. H. Smith that after second reading tho measure should be referred to a Select Committee with power to insert clauses to meet the equities of the case, so far as the liabilities of the City and the interests of the Metropolis were concerned. A Committee, presided over by Sir Lyon Playfair, 53 considered the Bill in the light of a reference drawn in the spirit of Mr. Smith's suggestion, and finding that the liabilities of the Corporation in respect of the Holborn Valley improvements still amounted to £744,000, so amended the Bill as to provide that an unappropriated surplus from the coal dues of £100,000 and the savings on the penny per ton, which has hitherto been retained when the drawback was paid, amounting to £60,000 should be specifically appropriated towards meeting the obligation in question; and also that the coal dues should be continued for another year from July, not at thirteen pence but at four pence, which, it was estimated would bring in a further sum of £142,000, making in all £302,000. The Corporation having assented to the reference to the Committee, abided loyally by its decision, though they would, no doubt, have been glad to get more assistance in relief of a heavy obligation incurred for an improvement which was decidedly of benefit to the whole of the Metropolis. City of London Parochial Charities.—It will be remembered that, in the last report, the Vestry detailed at length the efforts which were being made to obtain a grant from the City Parochial Charities Fund towards the establishment of a Polytechnic in North London. In September a draft scheme was issued by the Charity Commissioners for dealing with these Charities. The Marquis of Northampton had generously given a site in the centre of Clerkenwell, where Taylor's Bow and part of St. John Street Road stood, and the Scheme of the Commissioners proposed to set aside for the City of London College, the Birkbeck Institute, and the Northampton Institute the sum of £51,000 towards the building, and an endowment of £5,350 annually, E 54 The Governing body, which is permanently to administer the funds, was proposed to be, 5 Members appointed by the Crown as required 4 „ „ City Corporation by the Act 2 „ „ London County Council 2 „ University of London 2 „ „ Council of University College, London 2 „ „ Council of King's College, London 2 „ „ Ecclesiastical Commissioners 1 „ „ Governing Body of the Bishopsgate Foundation 1 „ „ Governing Body of the Cripplegate — Foundation 21 being the number specified by the Act. The Vestry wrote to the Charity Commissioners expressing the satisfaction of the Vestry with the part of the scheme affecting this Parish, and the hope that any modifications which may be made in consequence of the representations of other bodies might not be allowed to prejudice the appropriation of the sum for the purpose, and they received a reply that the question should receive their careful consideration. The Scheme was adversely criticised by the London County Council, and some of the Vestries and District Boards. The criticisms were on various details of the Scheme, and generally are too lengthy to be reproduced here, but the following reply of the Charity Commissioners to the County Council will at once indicate the chief objections and the course pursued by the Charity Commissioners in regard thereto:— Charity Commission, January, 1890. Sir, I am to acknowledge the receipt of copies of the report and resolutions recently adopted by the London County Council on the subject of the above-mentioned scheme. The Commissioners have considered those documents with the care and attention due to the important body by which (though, as the Commissioners learn, by little more than an even vote) the decision 55 adopting them was arrived at. But although they are not insensible to the gravity of some of the considerations pressed upon them, they cannot concur with the Council in thinking it necessary that the funds belonging to the City Parochial Charities should be burdened by a further prolongation of their powers. They have, from the commencement of their operations under the City of London Parochial Charities Act, 1883, in the year 1884, been engaged in examining, with the aid of able and well-qualified assistance, in what made they could most beneficially, in the interest of the poorer classes of the Metropolis, discharge the duties imposed upon them by the Statute. In this examination they have been still further aided, not only by the advice of various public organisations, but still more by the numerous applications made to them from all quarters of the Metropolis on behalf of aimost every form of philanthropic activity, which brought to their notice objects that might otherwise have escaped their attention, and compelled them to consider, from time to time, on what grounds such applications must either be acceded to or refused. And if they have in the result made by their draft scheme an appropriation of the funds which, though by no means exhaustive, is no doubt large, this is not due to the fact that they have at any time set themselves to make an exhaustive appropriation, but is because the course of events and the existence (in their judgment) of a unique opportunity for usefulness oompelled them to assist in the promotion of projects conceived in the interests of the poorer classes, the value of which is vouched by experience and the ultimate success of which is not, they think, open to reasonable doubt. The course which the Commissioners have pursued in this matter has not been unknown to the public. Although a considerable time elapsed before they thought themselves justified in taking any decisive step towards the appropriation of the surplus funds, when they commenced to do so their action very speedily became a matter of notoriety, not only to the numerous bodies and persons who were themselves successful or unsuccessful applicants, but, through the public press, to the public at large. In the report which they presented to Her Majesty at the commencement of the year 1888, they not only recorded what had been already done, but were able to indicate in general terms the course of action which seemed pointed out to them by their inquiries, and in their report of February, 1889, they not only continued the record of events (which were themselves of a sufficiently striking nature), but stated with great fulness and detail the objects which they had in view, the methods by which they proposed to pursue them, and the grounds on which their action was based. The proposals now embodied in the draft scheme of August 31 and carried out by the subordinate schemes (and, in particular, by 56 the Bishopsgate and Cripplegate schemes, the scheme for the Victoria Hall and the full and detailed scheme for the City Polytechnic published on the 6th December) differ from those set forth in the last-mentioned report in nothing but in the greater detail, and in the fact that the Commissioners have been unable to realise those proposals so fully as they had ventured to hope and as the needs of the case require. The most prominent feature in those schemes, as in the report of February, 1889, and the point to which the criticism of the Committee is mainly directed, is undoubtedly that which relates to the establishment and maintenance of Polytechnic institutes. But nothing leads the Commissioners to suppose that the public, which, in various parts of the Metropolis, by energetie co-operation and large pecuniary aid, and in other quarters by pressing demands for the extension to their neighbourhood of the Polytechnic system, have testified their approval of the objects aimed at, and the proposed method of obtaining them, have withdrawn the favour with which they have hitherto regarded the foundation of these institutes. On the contrary, they observe with pleasure that since the passing of the resolutions now under consideration a western district, comprising several wealthy and populous parishes, has proposed to take upon itself the whole burden of establishing a Polytechnic in a neighbour- • hood to which the Commissioners with great regret felt themselves unable to render assistance. The Commissioners could not, without the gravest reasons, take upon themselves the responsibility of discouraging and retarding the realization of plans which are of so great promise to the poorer classes of the Metropolis, and which they have, after careful inquiry, sanctioned, and by that sanction have no doubt in some degree tended to promote. They are not, however, surprised to learn that the Committee appointed by the Council has found it difficult to examine fully or accurately into a matter which the Commissioners, acting in the discharge of their duty, have been so long occupied in investigating under circumstances whch may at least be thought not unfavourable to the formation of a sound judgment. They cannot fail to observe in the report on which the resolutions were founded inaccuracies so considerable with respect to existing institutions, that, having regard to the actual division of opinion, they think it would not be unreasonable to suppose that a report possessing greater exactness might have led the Council to a different conclusion. Neither can they omit to notice that the very full and detailed exposition of their views which is to be found in their report of February last, seems to have engaged to a very small extent the attention, and to a still smaller extent the critical examination, of the Committee. The Commissioners cannot but regard this circumstance as of 57 importance, not only with reference to the question of Polytechnic institutes, but also with reference to the provision of public libraries in connection with the parishes of Bishopsgate and Cripplegate, to which the adverse criticism of the Committee is also directed. That report points out that the Commissioners had endeavoured not only to obtain a wide and comprehensive view of the needs of the poorer classes of the Metropolis, but also of the possibility of those needs being supplied from other sources and by independent organizations and agencies, whether public or private, and it further pointed out that in general the expenditure of the charitable funds on the foundation of libraries would be an unwise interference with the operation of the Public Libraries Acts, since it would in the first place transfer to the charities a burden which may be, and in all great towns but the Metropolis is, borne by the rates, and would in the second place tend to check the disposition of localities to provide for themselves. In framing their schemes they had before them the facts relating not only to the most important free libraries of the great provincial towns, but to the few instances of free libraries then existing in the Metropolis, and they found in these facts no reason for thinking that the mode of action recommended in the report of the Committee would have been successful, while, on the other hand, whether successful or otherwise, it would have seriously checked and impeded the much greater success which is now being attained through the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts. The Commissioners also pointed out in their report the grounds on which they might without interference with that movement proceed to the establishment of free libraries in connection with the city where those Acts were never likely to be applied, and they further pointed out that in doing so they were giving the recognition which they thought (and which they still think) due under the Act to the interests of those resident and employed in the city. They cannot but regret that the statement of these views contained in their report of February last should have failed to elicit any comment from the Committee. Notwithstanding the disadvantages under which, in these circumstances, the Commissioners labour, they have carefully considered the resolutions of the Council with the endeavour to discover in what points they could, consistently with their views of their duty, give effect to the recommendations therein contained, and I am to state— (1.) That they concur in the recommendation of the Council that the number of their representatives on the central governing body should be increased, and that the School Board of London should also be represented; and they will accordingly amend their scheme, by providing for 58 the appointment of four members by the Council (as proposed by the resolution of the Council of the 1st October last), and two by the School Board, the appointment of the latter being deferred to the not distant event of the severance of the general from the ecclesiastical property, and the occurrence of the vacancies which will be thereby created. (2.) With respect to the ecclesiastical provision, the Commissioners have been and are still carefully engaged in the task of revising the schedules relating thereto. But whatever their opinion might be with respect to the considerations set forth in the report of the Committee they must point out that it is their duty to give effect to the Act of Parliament which they are administering, and not to attempt to frame a Statute for themselves. And they must also observe that not only do those appropriations, which appear to the Council excessive, appear to others very insufficient, but a very slight consideration of the schedules will show that some of the largest appropriations are made to churches of so high an architectural and historical interest that few would be willing to see their removal, but so wanting in endowment that they could only be provided with the necessary funds under the powers specially given to the Commissioners by the 14th Section of the Act. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, D. R. FEARON, H. De la Hooke, Esq., Secretary. London County Council Office, Spring Gardens, S.W. School Board for London.—On the 2nd January, 1890, a letter was received from the St. Olave's District “Board of Works inviting the Vestry to join in a Petition for a Royal Commission to enquire into the working of the School Board for London, with special regard to its building work and general expenditure, and a resolution was unanimously passed agreeing with such suggestion. On the 13th February, a letter was received from the Lewisham District Board of Works, calling attention to the large increase in the School Board Rate, and urging the School Board to exercise all possible economy in conducting their operations. 59 On the 27th of the same month, a letter was received from the Wandsworth Vestry forwarding a resolution expressing the opinion that the most searching inquiry should be instituted into the affairs of the London School Board, so far as it relates to the buying of sites and the building of Schools, also as to the reasons for the very large increase in the amount of their Precepts—the necessity for such enquiry being evident from the statements made by the Members at their Meeting on February 6th. A letter was also received from the Vestry of Battersea, stating that the Vestry view with the greatest concern the ever increasing rate demanded for School Board purposes, having regard to the already excessive burden of taxation borne by the ratepayers of this Parish and the Metropolis generally, and therefore directing their Clerk to communicate with the Vestries and District Boards throughout the Metropolis, with a view to a Conference being held in order that united action may be taken to urge Her Majesty's Government to seriously consider as to the necessary action to secure greater economy in the administration of the affairs of the School Board for London, and stating that they should be glad to know whether, in the event of the Vestry convening a Conference upon the subject, the Clerkenwell Vestry would be prepared to send delegates to represent them thereat. The Vestry thereupon passed a resolution to co-operate with the above Vestries in any combined action that may be taken. On the 20th March, letters were read from the Vestry of Kensington, expressing the opinion that a Royal Commission should be appointed to enquire into the irregularities alleged to have taken place in the acquisition of the sites, and the construction of 60 the buildings for the School Board, and also inviting the Vestry to a Conference on the 14th April on the subject of the increase in the School Board Rate. Messrs. Johnson, F. G. Scheib, and Sans were appointed as such Delegates on behalf of this Vestry. Local Government Act—Medical Officers of Health.-—Referring to the statement in last year's report, that the Local Government Act provides that the London County Council may contribute one-half the salaries of the Medical Officers of Health appointed in future, such appointments to be subject to the regulations of the Local Government Board, and that a Conference had been convened by the Camberwell Vestry on the subject, the Yestry have received the report of the Conference of Delegates, expressing the opinion that it is not at present desirable to alter the relationship between the Medical Officers of Health and the Local Authorities. Local Government Act—Main Roads.—Last year's report stated that the Vestry had submitted to the London County Council a list of thoroughfares which it was thought should be declared main roads under the provisions of the Local Government Act. The Council subsequently asked for, and was furnished with, plans of the roads referred to. Just before the close of the official year, the Yestry received a letter from the Council stating that it had resolved to suggest to the Government the desirability of the Act, being amended by exempting the County of London from the operation of the Section of the Act for reasons which are set forth 61 in the following report of their Highways Committee — Your Committee have considered the applications which have been made by the several Vestries and District Boards for thoroughfares in their respective districts to be declared by the Council to be "Main Roads," under the provisions of sections 11 and 41 of the Local Government Act, 1888, and the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878. The last-named Act did not apply, so far as the provisions as to main roads were concerned, to London (in fact, the Metropolis was specially excluded by section 2 from the operation of the Act), but by section 41 of the Local Government Act, 1888, the provisions of tbe Highways Act relative to main roads were extended to London. Under section 15 of the Highways Act, 1878, the Common Council of the City, or any Vestry or District Board, if of opinion that any highway in its district ought to become a main road, by reason of such highway being a medium of communication between great towns, or a thoroughfare to a railway station, or otherwise, may apply to the London County Council for an order declaring such part of the road as is within its district to be a main road; and if the Council be of opinion that there is probable cause for the application, it is to cause the road to be inspected, and if satisfied that the road ought to bo a main road, is to make an order accordingly. All the local authorities in London, with the exception of the Court of Common Council and the Strand District Board, have exercised this power, and the applications received refer to thoroughfares of all descriptions, and in all parts of London, the total length of which. as stated by the Vestries and District Boards, is a little over 412 miles. The circumstances of the main thoroughfares of London are so peculiar, that your Committee have found considerable difficulty in applying the provisions of the section to the roads referred to in the applications. The thoroughfares of London can scarcely now be considered as means of communication between great towns, in the sense which is evidently intended by the Act; for as the greater part of the goods and passenger traffic is now brought into and taken out of London by railway, there is very little of what may be deemed through traffic by road between great towns on either side of the country, while, with so many railway stations in London, nearly every road and street may be considered to be a part of a thoroughfare to a railway station, and so would answer the description in the section. Your Committee may also point out that the extra cost of maintenance caused by traffic passing through a main thoroughfare from one London district to another, or to and from a railway station, is probably more than met by the increase in the rateable value of the property consequent upon the road being used for either of those purposes. The Local Government Act casts upon the Council the duty of maintenance of any thoroughfares declared to be main roads, but the local authorities may claim to retain the management, &c., of such roads, and in that case the Council is called upon to pay the 62 cost of such maintenance, without any power being given to the Council to exercise control in any way as to the manner in which the road shall be dealt with. Thus, in the case of a main road running through several parishes and districts, a part may be paved with wood, another with granite, another with asphalte, and yet another part may be macadamised, at the will of the respective local authorities; but the Council, on the report of its Surveyor, that each part of the road has been properly maintained and repaired, will have to pay a sum, to be agreed upon from time to time, for the cost of maintenance, without having any power to direct that the system of maintenance of the road shall be uniform throughout its entire length. This appears to your Committee to be an arrangement which requires some alteration, either in the direction of relieving the Council of its responsibility, or, if such responsibility be retained, of giving the Council some power of control over the manner in which the money is to be expended and of requiring continuity in the system of paving or otherwise to be adopted with regard to the road. The question whether a road has been maintained in a satisfactory condition, which must be decided each time before the Council's contribution is paid, would probably give rise to constant friction. In the case of a road passing through several parishes, the work of repair and maintenance in one district may have been done to the satisfaction of the Council's Surveyor, while in the adjoining parish the work may not have been satisfactorily performed ; and should the Council require any particular standard of maintenance to be observed, as a preliminary to the payment of its contribution, great dissatisfaction might arise. The Local Government Act provides (section 11, sub-section 7) that where the Council declares a thoroughfare to be a main road, such declaration shall not take effect until the road has been placed in proper repair and condition to the satisfaction of the Council. Some of the Vestries and District Boards have expended considerable sums in putting the thoroughfares in their districts into a state of proper repair, which sums have been borrowed on loan, and are in course of repayment, but in some districts where the roads are not in good condition, the expenditure before the declaration of the Council could take effect would probably be very large, and it might be a hardship to compel local authorities to embark at very short notice on an expenditure which they had not contemplated, and which might interfere with the carrying out of other and more pressing requirements. At the same time, it would be manifestly unfair to the other districts of London if the Council were to accept the responsibility of the cost of the future maintenance of roads which were not at the first in good and proper condition. Under the Local Government Act the duty of maintaining those roads in the County of London which have been disturnpiked since 31st December, 1870, devolves upon the Council, but the local authorities have the same power of retaining the management of the portions of these roads in their respective districts, as in the case of roads to be declared by the Council to be main roads, and the Council is to make a payment towards the cost. Your Committee 63 have found considerable difficulty in interpreting and reconciling the provisions of section 11 and the sub-sections thereof in the Local Government Act. Sub-section 1 casts upon the County Council the duty of wholly maintaining the existing main roads, while subsection 2 provides that in case a local authority shall claim to retain the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing the roads within its district, it shall thereupon be entitled to retain the same, and the Council shall make an annual payment towards the cost of the maintenance and repair, and sub-section 4 gives the Council power to require a local anthority to retain the management of a road in consideration of an annual payment by the Council for the cost of the undertaking. Your Committee have taken the opinion of Counsel upon the question of the meaning of the words "towards" and "for" as used in these sub-sections, but have not been able to arrive at any definite conclusion upon it. Upon a review of all the circumstances your Committee are of opinion that the provisions in the Local Government Act and the Highways and Locomotives Act, with reference to main roads, are totally inapplicable to the thoroughfares in the County of London, having regard to the peculiar conditions under which they are managed, and the number of authorities concerned in such management. Your Committee therefore recommend:— "That the Government be requested to take the necessary measures for the amendment of the Local Government Act by exempting the County of London from the operation of sections 11 and 41 (4) of the Act; and that the President of the Local Government Board be requested to receive a Deputation from the Council on the subject." The Vestry at the close of the year were considering what action they should take in the matter. London Subways and Overhead Wires Bill.— A letter was received from the London County Council, forwarding copy of their London Subways and Overhead Wires Bill, to empower them to make subways under streets, and to provide for the use of such subways, and for the control and regulation of overhead wires. A letter was subsequently received from the Vestry of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, suggesting the desirability of concerted action in taking steps to prevent the Bill becoming law in its present form, as in their opinion the powers sought to be obtained by the London County Council should be vested in the Local Authorities. 64 After consideration, the Vestry decided to co-operate with the Vestry of Kensington in the matter. The Bill was eventually withdrawn. Public Health (Metropolis) Bill.—In February, 1890, the Vestry received the following letter from the Local Government Board :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 31st January, 1890. Sir, I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to enclose a draft of a Bill which has been prepared for the purpose of consolidating the law with reference to the Public Health in the Metropolis. It will be observed that in the case of provisions which are now in force in London, and which when the Public Health Act, 1875, was passed, were amended as regards Districts outside the Metropolis, the Clauses, as amended, have been inserted in the Bill. Some alterations have also been made with respect to amounts of penalties. The President will be obliged by being furnished with any observations or suggestions which the Vestry may desire to offer on the draft Bill as a Consolidation Bill. He is especially desirous of having his attention drawn to any provisions in the Bill, with the exception of those above referred to, which it may bo considered do not accurately reproduce the present law. The favour of an early reply is desired. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, To the Vestry Clerk of the HUGH OWEN, Parish of St. James & St. John, Secretary. Clerkenwell. The Bill was referred to the Medical Officer of Health, who submitted a series of suggested alterations to meet difficulties which have arisen in the working of the present Acts, and the Vestry carefully considered same and forwarded them to the Local Government Board in reply to their letter. The Bill, however, has not yet been introduced into Parliament. 65 Advertising Stations (Bating Act).—By this Act, passed in the Session of 1889, the Vestry is empowered to rate land temporarily or permanently used for advertisements, and not otherwise occupied, according to the value of such use. The Act also provides for the rating of occupied hereditaments used for advertisements, such as the blank walls of houses and such like, where the rateable value is to be increased by the value of such use. The Act also deals with the ordinary temporary hoardings for which licenses are granted by the Vestry. The Vestry may either prohibit the affixing of advertisements, or sanction same on payment of a sum to be determined by them. The Vestry partially anticipated this enactment some years ago by adopting a new method of charging for the hoarding license; whereas formerly a fee of 2s. 6d. per month was charged, it is now 2s. per hundred square feet per month. This was adopted to put a check on the undue prolongation of the time during which hoardings have been kept up for the express purpose of the advertisement revenue, and it has undoubtedly brought in a considerable sum of money to the Parish. In some cases, however, where the hoarding, and the consequent fee, have been very large, the fee has been reduced to £10, the Vestry acting under the decision in the case of the Post Office in St. Martin's-leGrand. It would seem, however, that this restriction need no longer be acted upon, and it would appear reasonable to continue some such scale as that hitherto adopted. The Vestry have suggested that a Conference of the rating authorities of the Holborn Union and of the Union Assessment Committee be convened 66 to consider the matter, with the view to a uniform basis of rating being adopted. Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889.— This measure enacts provisions which many of the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis have considered necessary for some years past in the interests of the public health. It provides that where an inmate of any building used for human habitation within a district to which the Act extends, is suffering from Small Pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued, or Puerperal Fevers, then unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an infectious disease are received, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say— "(a) The head of the family to which such inmate (in the Act referred to as the patient) belongs, and in his default the the nearest relatives of the patient present in the building, or being in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives every person in charge of or in attendance on the patient, and in default of any such person the occupier of the building shall, as soon as he becomes aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, send notice thereof to the Medical Officer of Health of the district." "(b) Every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit the patient shall forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, send to the Medical Officer of Health for the district a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the building, and the infectious disease from which, in the opinion of such medical practitioner, the patient is suffering." Every person required by the Act to give a notice or certificate who fails to give the same, will be liable on summary conviction in manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. If, however, a person is 67 not required to give notice in the first instance, but only in default of some other person, he will not be liable, to any fine if he satisfies the court that he had reasonable cause to suppose that the notice had been duly given. The Act came into force on the 30th October, 1889, and the Vestry took all necessary steps to give full effect to the Act, by providing and issuing to all Medical Practitioners in the parish, as far as they could be ascertained, notices and forms of certificate. City and North of London Railway.—Plans of a scheme, with this title, were deposited in November, 1889, but the contemplated works only affected a few yards of roadway in the Parish, at the junction of City and Goswell Road. The scheme, however, was shortly afterwards abandoned. Old Street, Widening of.—In October, 1889, the Vestry received the following letter from the Vestry of St. Luke's :— St. Luke, Middlesex, Vestry, Vestry Hall, Cur Road, E.C., Octoler 17th, 1889. Dear Sir, The completion by the late Metropolitan Board of Works of the new line of thoroughfare running from Commercial Street to Bloomsbury, via Clerkenwell Road and Great Eastern Street, of which line Old Street forms the Central link, has developed, as was anticipated, an enormous heavy and continuous traffic, and as your Vestry may be probably aware, the difficulties attending this traffic have been largely increased by the recent continuation by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company of their Old Street lines to Gray's Inn Road and Southampton Row, Holborn, respectively, and the running of additional cars thereon. The difficulties and delays experienced by passengers and the vehicular traffic generally, particularly in the narrow portion of Old Street at its western end, and the intersection of that street and Clerkenwell Road and Goswell Road, are very considerable, but 68 always highly inconvenient, while the crossing of the congested thoroughfares is attended with danger to both life and limb of the pedestrian. The Vestry have urged upon the London County Council the necessity of widening Old Street at its western end, and that such widening should be effected by the Council as a fitting completion to the Street Improvement Scheme for the construction of the New Street from East to West already mentioned, and they have asked the Council to undertake the work as one of a Metropolitan character. The Vestry have recently received a letter from the Council to the effect that they do not see their way clear at present to entertain the proposal, but the Vestry are so strongly of opinion that the improvement should be carried out at the earliest possible moment, that they have determined to again press the matter upon the Council, and to ask that a deputation may be received in support of their views. The matter is one which the Vestry thinks largely affects the Ratepayers of the Parish of Clerkenweil, and they desire me to ask whether your Vestry will co-operate with the Vestry, and join in the proposed deputation to the Council, and if so, whether they will appoint members of the Vestry to represent, them on the occasion. I shall be glad to have an early reply. I am, dear Sir, Yours truly, R. Paget, Esq., G. W. PRESTON, Rosoman Street, Clerk. Clerkenweil, E.C. The Vestry agreed to co-operate with the St. Lukes Vestry in the matter, and appointed Mr. Gibson, Mr. Dixie, Mr. Kelly, and Mr. Ross as a deputation to the County Council to urge the necessity for such widening. A Conference was subsequently held at the St. Luke's Vestry Hall, on the 5th February; but during the year now under review no further approach was made to the Council on the subject. Omnibus Fares—In September, 1889, the Vestry had their attention directed to the fares charged by the London General Omnibus Co., on the route from Islington to Holborn through this Parish, it being pointed out that, whereas penny fares existed 69 from the boundaries of the Parish in Islington and Holborn, the fare was twopence to or from any point within the Parish itself, and they therefore communicated with the Company on the subject, and received a reply reminding the Vestry that the road between the "Angel" and Holborn has two very steep hills, and is more expensive to work than a level road, but stating, that in order to meet the wish of the Vestry, the Company have adopted a fare of 1d. between the "Angel" and Holborn (corner of Gray's Inn Road). The Vestry thanked the Company for responding so promptly to the suggestion. Buxton Buildings.—The Vestry finding that the water closets in these buildings contained also in one corner a sink or washing place, and in another a copper used for washing, and that the seat of the closet was not shut off from the rest of the room by any partition or enclosure, called upon Mr. Feary, the owner, to provide and fit a proper door and an efficient enclosure to the water closet, and in default of compliance with the notice, issued a summons against him. The Magistrate dismissed the summons, holding that the door already provided to the wash-house was sufficient to comply with the Act, but consented to state a case for a Superior Court if the Vestry so desired. The Vestry, therefore, took Counsel's opinion on the subject, which was in favour of prosecuting the appeal. The case accordingly was heard by the Queen's Bench Division, who overruled the decision of the Magistrate, and held that the Vestry had power to make an Order, and that the Magistrate had no option but to convict in case of neglect to comply with such order. 70 Public Library.—A report of the parochial proceedings during the year would be incomplete without an allusion to the laying of the foundation stone of the new Public Library at the junction of Skinner Street and Whiskin Street, on Saturday, March 8th. The interesting ceremony was performed by Mr. William Masterman, the Master of the Skinners' Company, who have leased the site to the Commissioners at the nominal ground rent of 40s. The Eev. J. H. Rose, M.A., Vicar, and Chairman of the Library Commissioners, gave a brief sketch of the history of the movement which led to the establishment of the Library, together with particulars of the manner in which the parishioners had availed themselves of the advantages so placed at their disposal. As the Commissioners issue a report annually, which is obtainable on application, it is not necessary to enter more fully into the subject here. Meetings.—The following is a list of the number of Meetings of the Vestry and its Committees during the year :— Vestry 50 Works Committee 48 Wharf Committee 6 Joint Works and Sanitary Committee 3 Sanitary Committee 23 Assessment Committee 34 Finance Committee 17 Parliamentary Committee 2 Special Committees 9 Petty Sessions 4 196 STATEMENT and ACCOUNT of all Moneys Received and Expended from 26th March, 1889 to 25th March, 1890.

PURSUANT to the 195th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, We hereby certify that we have carefully examined the respective Accounts of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint James and Saint John, Clerkenwell, for the year ending Lady-day, 1890, and that we find them to be true and correct except that we disallow and surcharge the following item of payment, viz.;—Testimonial to Mr Ex-Churchwarden Spires. £15 15s. 0d. We disallov the above item on the ground that the payment was inexpedient and undesirable, and an illegal and improper payment out of the General Rate of the Parish; and we surcharge the following persons with such payment, viz.:—James Gibson, William Pierpoint, and William Davies, the signatories to the cheque drawn for payment of the amount. We have also much pleasure in expressing our approval of the admirable manner in which the books have been kept, and also in stating that in our task w# received very material assistance from Mr. Ernest Paget, the First Assistant Clerk. I sign and agree to the above with the exception of so much as relates to the surcharge. Dated this 2nd day of July, 1890. Wm. WATSON WESTON, T. GRANVILLE HOCKRlDGE, HENRY VOSE, EDMUND LENARD.

Bell Laying-out St. James' Churchyard and widening St. James Walk £948 85 REPORT OF THE WORKS COMMITTEE on Dusting, Slopping, &c., For the Year to 25th March, 1890. Dusting.—During the year 8228 loads of dust and 171 loads of trade refuse have been removed from the Parish. After sifting same 128 freights of ashes and breeze, containing 7992 chaldrons have been removed from the Wharf, for which a sum of £424 6s. 9d. has been received, being an average of £3 6s. 4d. per freight, as compared with £3 6s. 10d., £3 2s. 3d. and £2 19s. 5d. for the three previous years. 17½ freights of hardcore have been removed, for which 16 barges have been hired at a cost of £55 5s. 0d., while 109 loads (equal to 1½ freight) have been removed by a Contractor. In consequence of a strike of the Thames Bargemen which commenced on the 1st March, but which was threatening for some time previously, extra exertions were made to get the Parish cleared of dust as far as possible before the strike actually commenced. Extra horses, carts and men were therefore hired of Mr. Varney for 13 days during December, January, and February, at a cost of £36 4s. 6d., and £51 was paid for barges to remove the unsifted dust. G 86 Dust Sifting.—In June, 1889, the Vestry altered the system under which the dust sifting had been carried out. Previously the Vestry paid Is. 3d. per load to a contractor for such sifting, he paying all wages and finding the tools, and taking the rags, bones, iron and other articles found in the dust. The system was then altered, mainly with the view of ameliorating the position of the women who do the sifting, and securing to them payment in money instead of part money and part small coals picked from the dust, and the Vestry therefore severed their connection with the contractor, and paid all concerned direct. The cost has been about £100 extra for the nine months of the year during which the new system has been carried out. Street Sweepings.—During the year 5669 loads of street sweepings and 761 loads of dung were removed from the Parish, 344 of which were collected on Sunday mornings. 145½freights were disposed of, 13 being sold for £12, 100 being removed free, 29 barges were hired for £24 12s. 6d., and 3½ freights were carted away at a cost of £7 7s. 2d. Watering.—The watering was done mainly by the Vestry's staff, but for 84 days an average of 4.9 horses per day were hired from Mr. Varney for the purpose. Cartage.—The horses and carts have also been employed during the year in carting stone, refuse from 449 gullies, sewer refuse (34 loads), and 143 loads of rubbish. For cartage purposes 57 horses, carts, and men have been hired during the year from Mr. Varney. Horses.—One horse has been sold and two horses have been purchased during the year, the number at the close of the year being 20. Vans and Carts.—The number of vans and carts belonging to the Vestry is—13 vans, 8 carts, and 12 water vans, one new van having being built by the wheelwright. 87 Fodder.—The Fodder account amounts to £832 11s. 6d., being an average of 15s. 11d. per horse per week, an increase from last year of 9d. per horse per week. The increase in the net expenditure for the past year is due to several causes. Two horses were purchased for £118; the Jetty was repaired at a cost of £138; there is an increase in the cost of Fodder of £50, and in the cost of Dust Sifting of £80. The dry season of 1889 accounts for an increase in the cost of horse hire for watering of about £120, and the strike of the bargeman for the item of £51 for the removal of rough dust, and a decrease of the income from the sifted dust. There is a decrease of £55 in the amount received for street sweepings, and a sum of £28 has been expended in getting rid of the wet slop in the Winter months. On the other hand the item of £372 for depreciation of the stock is no longer charged to the expenditure, the original outlay having been now written off, and all repairs and renewals charged against the several years in which the outlay was incurred. The Net Expenditure for the year ended 25th March, 1890, is shown by the following amounts:— RECEIPTS. EXPENDITURE. £ s. d. £ s. d. £ s. d.

Surveyor's Office, Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 30th October, 1890. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my Report upon the Works, &c., executed by your Vestry during the year ending Lady-day, 1890. SEWERS AND GULLIES. Sixty-five sewers were cleansed and repaired, one new side entrance cover was fixed, 6 new gullies were constructed, and 2 new gully drains, 501 gullies cleansed and repaired, 5 trapped, 13 new gully grates fixed, and 3 flushing shafts constructed. Two hundred and twenty-two loads of deposit were removed from the sewers and gullies. Sixty-one private drains were let off by the Sewermen, at the expense of the Owners of the premises upon which the drains were stopped, for which the sum of £6 2s. 0d. was received by the Vestry. 93 An 18-inch pipe sewer, 1,000 feet in length, was laid in Goswell Road from the head of the existing sewer at Rawstorne Street to opposite No. 351, Goswell Road, with two manholes, four gullies, and flushing shaft. A 12-inch pipe drain was constructed in Colney Hatch Lane from an existing drain near to the northern boundry of the Parish to Alexandra Park Road (a distance of 1,066 feet), to take off the surface water, with two inspection shafts, five gullies, and one flushing shaft. Upon the application of the Skinners' Company, the Vestry constructed a 12-inch pipe sewer in Whiskin Street from the head of the pipe sewer opposite No. 27, for a distance of 70 ft. eastwards. Half the cost of the work was borne by the Skinners' Company. A notice having been served upon the Owner of No. 8a, Upper Smith Street to reconstruct the drainage of his premises, it was found, upon opening down in the basement, that an old sewer taking the drainage of several houses in Spencer Street and Ashby Street passed under this house, the sewer being in a defective condition. The old brick barrel was therefore broken up, and 12-inch pipes substituted in lieu thereof. The whole of the pipe sewers in the Parish were flushed by water supplied by the New River Company, and the brick sewers, where practicable, 94 by Water from the main sewers being turned through them by means of flushing gates fixed in the sewers for that purpose. Drainage, Spencer Street.—A brick barrel drain at the rear of the houses on the north side of Spencer Street between Upper Smith Street and Goswell Road having become blocked, and a question arising as to who was responsible for the maintainance of such drain, the Vestry decided to clean out same at their own expense. COURT FLUSHING. The courts and alleys in the Parish were wrashed and sprinkled with carbolic acid at frequent intervals during the year whenever considered necessary by the Medical Officer of Health. HOUSE DRAINAGE. The total number of premises drained were 126 (including two houses in the outlying portion of the Parish at Muswell Hill) the details of which drainage is shown upon 108 plans prepared for that purpose, and deposited in the Surveyor's office : these drains consist of 1-12-inch, 1-19-inch, and 100-6-inch. The amount of fees received for making the connections of the new drains to the sewers was £108 18s. 0d. 95 PAVEMENTS. Carriageways—Granite.—The carriageway pavement of Tnrnmill Street, Farringdon Road (between Clerkenwell Green and Pear Tree Court) Farringdon Road (between Clerkenwell Road and Castle Street) was taken up, dressed, and relaid, the deficiency being made good with dressed granite cubes. The defective pebble carriageway of Mulberry Place was taken up, and relaid with dressed granite cubes, half the cost of which was paid by the Marquess of Northampton. The entrance to Dobney Court from Penton Street was paved with old granite cubes from Depot. The paving of the open space in St. John Street Road, near to Percival Street, known as the "Cab rank" being in a very defective condition the space was asphalted and railed in, and footways formed on the south and east side. The urinal was removed from the centre and re-erected on the south side. Channels.—The pebble channels of Buxton Street, Rodney Street, and Brewer Street were taken up and relaid with old granite cubes from Farringdon Road. Macadam Roads.—Re-metalled and steam rolled —Claremont Square south and west sides, Mount Zion, Sermon Lane, White Lion Street (from High Street to Baron Street), Rodney Street, Northampton Square, and Granville Place. 96 CHARLES STREET. The carriageway on the south side of this thoroughfare by the railings having become dangerous, three inch planking was fixed to the posts, and the carriageway raised to a uniform level. Footways.—North Street (from Pentonville Road to Collier Street), Buxton Street, Penton Place, and Brewer Street. 250 ft. Kerb was reset and 875 ft. of York relaid in Farringdon Road in conjunction with works executed by the Holborn Board of Works. JOBBING WORKS. For the maintainance and general repair of the carriageways and footways of the Parish, the following materials have been used:— 29 tons of new granite cubes were laid. Pit Ballast 32 cube yards.

The Vestry having petitioned the New River Company to provide a constant supply of water to the houses in the Parish, a great number of trenches were opened by the Company for the purpose of laying new mains and altering existing mains in various parts of the Parish, hence the amount received from the various Companies during the 98 year for the repair of Trenches was considerably above the average, the total being £1,609 11s. 4d. Snow.—The only snow storm that necessitated extra men being engaged occurred on December 7th 1889; the fall was, however, very slight, and the snow was got rid of the same day. LIGHTING. The following additions and alterations to the public lamps have been made during the year:— Myddelton Square, south east corner, 1 additional standard lamp. Caledonian Road, 2 additional standard lamps. Muswell Avenue, 1 do. do. Wilmington Square, East side, 1 do.

A considerable number of the trees planted by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association on Clerkenwell Green and in Penton Street died, and the number of new trees planted in the Parish to replace the dead ones was 48. Jerusalem Passage.—Complaints having been made to the Vestry of the nuisance caused by barrows and trucks passing through this passage, the Vestry decided to fix fall-down posts at each end of same. Albion Place.—Upon the application of the inhabitants of this place posts were also fixed here for a similar purpose. CHALET—CLERKENWELL ROAD. The Chalet Company being in liquidation this Chalet was closed, and became a nuisance to the public. Notice was therefore served upon the Official Liquidator to remove the same, which notice was not complied with, and the Chalet was eventually removed by the Vestry, and a refuge formed round the lamp already erected on the spot. BROAD YARD. Application was made to the Vestry by the occupiers of the warehouses in this Court to erect gates at the entrance, which should be closed at night to prevent nuisances, and as a protection to 101 the property. The Vestry agreed to the gates being fixed subject to the petitioners paying the cost, which they consented to do. An iron tablet was also fixed on the side of the premises stating that the Court was public way under the control of the Vestry. WILMINGTON SQUARE ENCLOSURE. Owing to the heavy vehicular traffic on the south side of Wilmington Square, and the consequent danger to children passing in and out of the garden, the Vestry decided to make an entrance on the east side of the square, and to close the gates on the south side. RE-NAMING, &c. OF STREETS. The following orders for re-numbering and renaming Streets were made by the London County Council.— Southampton Street, Renumbered. North Street, Melville Place, and Commercial Place, Renumbered as North Street. Cross Street, Hooper Street, and Berry Street, to be renumbered, and the whole line of thoroughfare to be Berry Street. STREET WATERING. The street watering was done by the Vestry's own vans, extra horses being hired as required, 4,301,000 gallons of water being used, the amount H 102 paid for which, including rent of meters, was £183 16s. 7d. The New River Company reduced the charge for water used in street watering from 9d. per 1,000 gallons to 8½d. per 1,000 gallons. URINALS. The Urinal at the junction of Pentonville Road and King's Cross Road was removed, and a refuge formed on the site. I have now adverted generally to the principal works in my department upon which I have been engaged during the past year. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM IRON, Surveyor. 103 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR 1889. To the Vestry of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell. Gentlemen, I do myself the honour of laying before you ray Thirtyfourth Annual Report on the Mortality &c., of the Parish during the year 1889. The number of deaths occuring from all causes in Clerkenwell during the year 1889 was 1,033. The annual average for the last ten years was 1,208, so that the deaths were 175 less than the average. The deaths in 1888 having been 1,168, those in 1889 were 135 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in the Parish in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— deaths. births. 1880 1,313 2,430 1881 1,254 2,414 1882 1,261 2,420 1883 1,172 2,402 1884 1,303 2,448 1885 1,195 2,390 1886 1,170 2,279 1887 1,216 2,363 1888 1,168 2,311 1889 1,033 2,277 104 The births were thus 34 less than in the preceding year, and 93 below the average. According to the Registrar General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 278 578 300 Amwell 261 577 316 Pentonville 220 538 318 Goswell 274 584 310 In each year a number of death of parishioners takes place in General and Special Hospitals, in the Workhouses, in the Infirmary, and in Lunatic Asylums, all of which are extra-parochial. The number of deaths which occurred in the Hospitals was 149; in the Workhouses, 99; in the Infirmary, 87; and in Lunatic Asylums, 14; 4 deaths also occurred in the street, making a grand total of 353. At the Census in 1871, the population of Clerkenwell amounted to 65,380 ; in 1881, to 69,076; the increase being 3,696. Assuming this rate of increase to have continued during the last eight years, the present population of the Parish would be 72,032. At this rate the intra-parochial mortality for the year has been 14.3 per 1000; including the hospital deaths, 16.4; and the workhouse and infirmary deaths, 19.2 per 1,000. Hence the mortality of the year has been considerably below that of the preceding year, and still more below the average of the last ten years. But this estimate of the Mortality of the Parish must be considered doubtful; for during the last few years many houses have been pulled down, and replaced by larger ones (mostly "Model" dwellings), which house four or more times the number of occupants which the older houses did; and this would necessarily increase the number of inhabitants beyond the decennial average, and so increase the rate of mortality. The mortality of all London during the year was 17.4—That of the West Districts, 17; the North Districts, 15.7; of the Central 105 Districts, 24.1; of the East Districts, 20.2; and of the South Districts, 16.6. The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic (infectious and contagious) diseases in the Parish in 1889, was 181; 31 less than in the preceding year. 31 less than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of the deaths from zymotic diseases occurring in Clerkenwell during the last 10 years are exhibited in the following table: — small pox. measles. scarlet fever. diphtheria. whping. cough. typhoid fever. diarrhœa. totals. 1880 2 26 45 6 87 14 65 245 1881 10 39 46 8 53 26 58 240 1882 0 61 50 10 81 18 40 260 1883 0 61 36 10 33 16 59 215 1884 6 48 15 12 69 7 79 236 1885 6 87 14 7 52 5 58 229 1886 0 18 8 4 42 7 93 172 1887 0 68 14 3 55 6 88 234 1888 0 62 8 10 63 4 65 212 1889 0 47 10 6 23 4 54 144 Thirty-seven deaths occurred from zymotic diseases in extraparochial hospitals; viz.:—3 from measles; 5 from scarlet fever; 18 from diphtheria; 6 from typhoid fever; and 5 from diarrhoea. The average number of deaths occurring in the Parish from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years was 218, so that the number for 1889 was 74 below the average. No case of Small Pox occurred during the year. 106 The number of deaths from Measles was less than that of the preceding years; 3 cases occurred in extra-parochial Hospitals. The number of deaths from Scarlet Fever was rather more than in the preceding years; 5 cases occurred in extra-parochial hospitals. The deaths from Diphtheria in the Parish were less than in the preceding years; but 18 deaths took place of patients removed to extra-parochial hospitals. The number of deaths arising from all causes in infants under 1 year of age was 339; 77 less than in last year. 6 extra-parochial deaths also occurred. The number of deaths occurring in young children is a fair indication of the general domestic management. Unfortunately the number of fathers of families in this Parish out of work, which is essentially what is called a "working parish," is very large, so that the mothers have to support the family, and the children must therefore be neglected; still the infantile mortality has not been so very large, when compared with that in the more favoured parishes. Thus the infantile mortality, to 1000 births, in the year, were:—In Clerkenwell, 15.7; Paddington, 13.8; Kensington, 13.4; Chelsea, 15.2; St. George, Hanover Square, 13.8; St. Martin'sin-the-Fields, 21 2; London (City), 13.3; St. George-in-the East, 18.1, &c. 176 deaths occurred in the Parish at and above 60, 105 in Workhouses, &c., making a total of 281. 89 inquest deaths were registered in the year, 12 less than in the preceding year; 20 extra-parochial inquests upon parishioners were held. 29 deaths occurred from violence, 21 less than in the preceding year. In 20 large English towns the mortality in 1889 was:—In London, 17.4; Brighton, 15.1; Portsmouth, 18.1; Norwich, 18.4; Plymouth, 25.2; Bristol, 17 6; Wolverhampton, 20.6; Birmingham, 18.7; Leicester, 16 9; Nottingham, 17.0; Liverpool, 21.6; Munchester, 26.7; Salford, 20.5 ; Oldham, 20.4; Bradford, 19.2; 107 Leeds, 22.1; Sheffield, 20.9; Hull, 20.3; Sunderland, 22.9; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 25.2. In Edinburgh the mortality was 18; in Glasgow, 24.8; and in Dublin, 25.7 per 1000. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself on October 14th, prior to licensing. They were 14: 6 in the Upper Wards, and 8 in the Lower, and kept by the same number of butchers. They were found to be in very good order. No complaint was made of them during the year by the neighbours or others. Cow-houses.—These were inspected at the same time as the Slaughter-houses. They were 16; 9 in the Upper and 7 in the Lower Wards; and kept by 16 cow-keepers. The number of cows was 144; 68 in the Upper Wards and 76 in the Lower. They were in very good order, and the animals were very fine and healthy. Bake-houses.—These were inspected twice in the year, in May and December. They were 58 in number, 31 in the Upper Wards, and 27 in the Lower; they were in very good condition. Mortuary.—The excellent Mortuary still fulfils its useful purpose. 263 bodies were brought into it during the year; of these 79 were for inquest purposes, upon which 38 post mortems were made; 85 were Holborn Union cases; and 99 were brought from the dwellings of parishioners, including 8 cases of Infectious disease. In the disinfection and purifying of the houses, the streets, the gullies, &c., of the parish, 1,584 gallons of carbolic acid, and 90 cwt. of carbolic powder were used during the year, at a cost of £105. Except when the weather was frosty, or very wet, the courts, alleys and crowded streets were mostly weekly flushed with carbolic water; the same was also used in watering the roads. Water Supply.—This is supplied entirely by the New River Company. It is of excellent quality. Its purity is examined by three eminent analysts; one on the part of the Government, and 108 two on the part of the Water Companies. The constant supply exists throughout the Parish; hence we ought not to see so many dirty faces and rooms as are constantly met with. Infectious Disease Notification Act.—This important Act became law on October 31st, 1889. It orders that where any inmate of a house is suffering from small pox, cholera diphtheria, scarlet fever or scarlatina, membranous croup, erysipelas, typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal fever, the medical attendant, also the head of the family, or other responsible person in the house, is forthwith to notify the existence of the disease to the Medical Officer of Health of the Parish. This Act has cast great labour and responsibility upon the Sanitary staff, as it involves the immediate examination of the conditions under which patients are living; the question of the necessity of removal to hospital; the sanitary condition of the dwelling, &c. It has, necessarily made us acquainted with the existence of numerous cases, which would otherwise have been overlooked, and so the disease further spread about. 101 cases came to knowledge during the last two months of the year, viz.: 53 scarlet fever, 23 diphtheria, 16 typhoid fever, 1 puerperal fever, and 8 erysipelas. Sale of Horse Flesh. Act.—This Act, to prevent the sale of horse flesh for human food, unless the fact that it is horse flesh is distinctly denoted at the place of sale, came into operation on the 29th of September, 1889. I have carefully gone over the distinctive characters of horse flesh from beef, with the Sanitary Inspectors, and may say that at present no case of such sale has yet taken place in the Parish. Inspectors' Reports.—The work performed by our attentive and energetic Inspectors, is shown below:— Wards 1, 2, 3 (Inspector Bartlett's District). May 1889, to May 1890. 191 defective drains remedied: 82 of which were reconstructed. Total length being 4,920 of 9ft.

Fines—Metropolis Management Act: £4 2s., and 16s. costs. Food and Drugs' Act: £5 8s. 6d., and £1 l0s. costs. Sanitary Act, 1866: 5s., and £1 3s. costs. 83 dirty yards cleansed and limewhited. 11 accumulations of refuse removed. 6 new dustbins provided. 12 new flush pipes to water-closets provided. 111 37 supplies of water to closets provided. 940 houses visited. 336 houses visited on complaint. 610 preliminary notices served. 250 statutory notices served. 207 notices under Registered Regulations served. 12 dirty water.cisterns cleansed. 12 untrapped water.closets remedied. 3 defective urinals remedied. 10 leaky roofs repaired. 8 defective stack pipes repaired. 28 defective water closets remedied. 47 sink waste disconnected from drain. 11 wash houses cleansed. 1 lot of fish destroyed. The Meteorology of the year was as follows:— 1889. TEMPERATURE. AVERAGE. DIFFERENCE FROM AVERAGE OF 118 YEARS. HUMIDITY (sATURATION=100.) HEIGHT OF BAROMETER. RAIN IN INCHES. DIFFERENCE FROM AVERAGE OF 74 YEARS. Year 48.8 ÷0.2 83 29.7 23.29 —1.69 First Quarter (Jan., Feb., March) 38.2 —0.6 84 29.8 4.3 -0.62 Second Quarter (April, May, June) 54.5 ÷2.3 80 29.6 7.2 ÷1.64 Third Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 58.9 —0.8 76 29.7 5.5 —1.76 Fourth Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 43.5 —0.2 90 29.8 6.1 —0.95 112 Hence the mean temperature of the year has been slightly above the average; that of the first, third, and fourth Quarters being below; that of the second being above. These relations have an important influence upon the mortality of a Parish; for a cold season increases the mortality from Pulmonary Diseases, while a warm one reduces them; and a warm Summer increases, while a cold Summer reduces the deaths from Diarrhoea.

APPENDIX I. 136 At a Meeting of the Vestry, held on the 18th December, 1873:— "The Clerk called attention to the fact that "since the Vestry had ceased to collect the Poor "Rate, which duty had reverted to the Guardians "or Governors of the Poor under the Local Act, "and which Board had been revived for the purpose "in November, 1871, there was no Poor Rate "Account published, except the remainder of those "in collection by the Vestry previous to that time, "and suggested whether it would not be desirable, "by an agreement between both Boards, to publish "the Poor Rate Account of the Guardians or "Governors as an appendix to the Annual Reports "of the Vestry, in which case there would be one "and a half years Poor-rate Account to be "appended to the Report about to be issued for the "year ended Lady-day last. "It was moved by Mr. Bamford, seconded by "Mr. Dore, and— "Resolved that such suggestion be approved "and adopted." (Extract from Board Minutes.) ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. The Poor Rate Account of the Guardians or Governors of the Poor for the year ending Ladyday, 1889, is annexed hereto accordingly. ???
