FROHLICH, JUN., Auditors. General Report of Works executed by THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER. IN THE YEAR 1879-80. 13 To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, March , 1880. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen. The lists of the more important Works undertaken and executed by the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster, during the twelve months ending March 25th, 1880, require no additional explanation as such Works have been previously decided upon by the Vestry or their Works Committee, with the exception of some uniooked for matter that must of necessity arise from time to time in the maintenance of so important a Parish. In these lists nothing very new, or special will be found, although there is a great deal in abeyance. The Work at present entrusted to the Local Authorities, that attracts the most attention on the part of the General Public, are the Paving Works, for the simple reason that everybody can see all that is done. As a fact a large Paving 14 matter becomes almost a source of Public amusement, and challenges much criticism, but this view is taken only by those who have no interest whatever in the result, or think they have no interest. The whole community have the most deep interest in results, although they have perhaps little voice in the actual methods employed to ensure their safety and comfort,—safety by adopting such materials and way of applying them as shall be the most secure from accident to man or beast, and even property—and comfort to obviate as much as possible the discomforts arising from those inseparable companions of busy trafic, Dust, Mud, and Noise, and the not to be forgotten element of smell. A quarter of a century since all these questions were, comparatively, and comparatively only, in a state of temporary calm; as it is, there is a definitely expressed opinion that improvement is possible, and demanded, not only in the interests of all, but to prove that the few, who represent the many are equal to the responsible position to which they are elected, by sparing no time, pains, or trouble, in honestly investigating everything that may show the way to an advance in every direction where improvements can be made, and though the Vestry of St James's as trustees of the funds entrusted to their care are most prudent in the application of the same, they have always furthered the cause of well considered 15 improvements, so far as the means at their disposal will allow, and as no deviations from existing systems have ever been made without ample proof of their advisability, there is little probability of any further alteration being made unless the same rigid investigation precedes the decisions at which they will arrive. In addition to the maintenance of the "Permanent way" of the roads the Vestry have been called upon to consider the question of safety to those who are on foot; four Foot-Passenger Refuges have been constructed at points, or crossings, where such safeguards were required. The selection of such spots involves a great amount of care, as regards the cost, which in itself is not very formidable, but as it affects the wear and tear of the roadway in the immediate vicinity, each Refuge involves in itself a kind of rent to maintain not the refuge but the immediate surface of the adjacent road. Perhaps if this fact was more generally understood it would be an answer to opinions sometimes expressed, or entertained, that the Vestry are, or have been dilatory in their erection where they seemed to be most required. Setting aside the question of reckless driving, which is often caused by boys entrusted with vehicles from which their age should preclude them, the traffic of the streets of London is, under the most favourable circumstances, a most formidable question and should almost be called a problem, or rather 16 the best way to meet it and ensure safety without hindrance, is becoming a very serious question indeed; that it will become more serious is apparent to all who are bound to deal with so important a subject. The Central Parishes or Districts such as St. James's have this fact forced upon them more prominently than the Suburban Districts, which are exempt from many of the difficulties where the roads are wider and the traffic less, and have been laid out to meet modern requirements never contemplated by the inhabitants of London one hundred years since, or at a considerably more limited period. It would be repetition to remind the Vestry that in a locality like St. James's, new neighbourhoods in the real sense of the word are impossible, although alterations might occur so that there are not any actually new sewers to record as having been built. If there were it would be much less trouble than it is now in dealing with the old, many of which were never intended for the use required by modern advances. This adaptation to modern requirements consequent upon the disuse of the cesspool principle, is constantly bringing to light the inadequacy of the old sewers for the purpose to which they are now put. The same remarks will apply to many house drains, which were not originally intended for much more than the conveyance of rain, or other surplus water from the premises into sewers, also meant for surface 17 water only. In the case of wide new roads or streets, with new houses, drains, and sewers, the present requirements are more manageable, but although most of the sewers in St. James's are in fair condition, the alteration mentioned has so far diverted their original intention that evils undreamt of at the time of their construction have to be constantly met and overcome in the most effectual manner of which the circumstances will permit. A. number of intercepting gully pits have been constructed on an improved principle which answer a variety of purposes, viz. to intercept the transmission of deleterious matter into the Sewers themselves, to allow of expeditious cleansing and to prevent the return of noxious odours from the Sewers themselves. As year by year these improvements are effected so a more perfect system is approached, but I am afraid in an imperceptible degree. The great question of ventilation is practically untouched, and to those who know, or in any way realize the extraordinary and almost incredible amount of miles and miles of the London sewers, and the way in which they join with each other, the solution of the difficulty seems as far off as ever. Here and there a local injury may be remedied, but Sewers like everything else will have air, and discharge it in however a disagreeable state, and the larger London grows so much the more does the matter become complicated and concentrated eventually in the intercepting B 18 main lines of the Sewers themselves where the whole of the general sewerage must arrive at last. A large, comprehensive, and correct map of the whole of the London sewerage as at present existing would hardly be believed as an actual reality. The alternative suggestion occurs, is it possible to prevent noxious matters from finding their way into the Sewers at all? Unless the Sewers can be kept fresh as a country brook, smell will escape from them somehow; stopping or extracting this at one point, will not check it at another, and hundreds of the most costly ventilators would have but little practical effect. I will not venture to guess the amount of mileage of the London Sewerage on both sides of the water, but I am sure it would be found to be counted by thousands of miles, instead of hundreds, counting tributaries and gully drains, side entrances and other numerous adjuncts all of which are receptacles more or less for unpleasant odours, I do not say whether noxious or no. Whether it will ever become practicable to construct public conveniences at sufficiently frequent intervals so as to be able to remove and utilize the soil, and to relieve the private House Drains, so that as a rule they could be resorted to instead of those at present in use in Houses, time will show, such a suggestion at present seems improbable but in the formation of new streets space might be reserved for some such purpose, so that in 19 course of time the W.C.'s inside a House would be looked upon as for the use of those inmates only whose avocations do not call them out, and for children, any imaginary indelicacy would soon disappear as to the general use of such establishments; at present the evil, or difficulty arising from the non-ventilation of Sewers is not so generally understood or felt, as to justify the propriety of making any such general suggestion. It is, however, perfectly practicable to prevent the quantity of trade refuse and vegetable matter or refuse of cooking, to find their way into the Sewers at all, most households could easily destroy a great deal that is now put down the sink or closet by the simple process of burning, and now that cooking appliances are becoming more and more general, and as all that will burn is fuel, it may become a matter of economy to put it to that use instead of its being turned into noxious waste as it now generally is. That the whole question of Sewer Ventilation is a most perplexing one is proved by the fact that numbers of able men having given years of consideration to the subject have not arrived at a more than partial or local remedy. To my own mind it is a kind of Will-o'-the-Wisp that cannot be grasped. Another paradoxical difficulty in a District like St. James's, is the construction of Public Conveniences. In districts where they can be easily made without injury 20 to the eye or to the inhabitants, they are the least wanted, but in the busier districts where they are the most needed, they cannot be done at all, and the Local Authorities are always compelled to assert their abstract right in the defence of public decency to maintain those they have. But little has been done during the past twelve months towards these most necessary places of retirement; some slight improvements have been made and every care taken of those that do exist, but no new ones have been added. Whatever is the cause of this, there is neither apathy nor parsimony as far as the St. James's Vestry is concerned; certainly some secluded situations might be found for the purpose but they would only be found by those who abuse and do not use them, while the general public who require them would be in perfect ignorance of their whereabouts. It is necessary that it should be understood "that they are abused. The idiotic mischief that has been perpetrated in the Wells Street, and Vine Street Urinals, is most deplorable to see and that there is an amount of "method in the madness" is clear from the evident use of a diamond to score the glass, in order to render the subsequent kick effective. I doubt if a glazier who uses a diamond in his business would care to stop out till such a time as the Urinals are deserted, to use a diamond simply to make good for trade. The white glazed tiles are now the objects 21 of attack, for which purpose a hammer or some such instrument must be intentionally taken to render the proposed mischief complete. As I find similar conveniences in what are called "low neighbourhoods" are appreciated and not assaulted, the inevitable conclusion is that it is not the lower orders that are the miscreants, for there is no other word, but that the mischief is the result of design, and not done for "a lark." The pleasure to the perpetrators is beyond the comprehension of any man claiming common sense. With these few observations of a general nature, all details being decided as the Works are carried on from time to time, I have the honour to be, Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, Your most obedient, humble servant, A.

General Report 62 29 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF The Vestry of St. James 's, Westminster. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, for the year 1879. The District of St. James's Parish covers an area of 164 statute acres, and the mean density of the population, taking) as a basis the enumeration of 1871, is 205 persons per acre. For the year 1879 the net mortality of the Parish amounts to a death rate of rather less than 17 per 1000—the population being taken at 35,500. The mortality from zymotics in the year 1879 has been 48, and there have been in addition five other deaths among Zymotic cases removed from the Parish to extra-Parochial Hospitals. 30 Of Fever, Small Pox, and Diphtheria, 83 cases came under notice during the year. Of these 83 cases, 4 were of Small Pox, 23 of Typhoid Fever, 52 of Scarlet Fever, and 5 of Diphtheria. 34 cases—3 of Small Pox, 8 of Typhoid Fever, 22 of Scarlet Fever and 1 of Diphtheria—were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. At a milk shop, No. 28, Great Marlborough Street, a case of typhoid fever occurred and ran most of its course in a small back room behind the shop. In this room the typhoid patient's evacuations were discharged, and the whole family also lived and slept. The rest of the house was let out in rooms to other families, excepting only an underground back kitchen, which was reserved for a process designated as "the cleansing" of the milk cans, and in which the water cistern was located. The atmosphere of the ground floor back room and of the shop was practically continuous, and, in the shop, there stood about shallow uncovered vessels containing milk dappled by a pellicle of dust and dirt which subsided upon its surface. The typhoid patient was attended to by members of the family who also were from time to time engaged, as I believe, in serving out milk to the general public, but of this it was difficult to get actual proof. There being no legal obligation to notify cases of infectious disease to the local 31 Sanitary authority, this case was only discovered when the disease had run almost its entire course under the conditions above described. I immediately visited and inspected the premises and, under threat of applying to the magistrate with a view to have the milk seized and condemned, and thus indirectly to stop the business, I succeeded in getting the mother to remove the girl at once to the house of a relative. This was at the end of February. I made a careful examination of several specimens of milk from the shop and it is only right to say that, examined microscopically, the milk was in no way abnormal, and that in point of cream and of solids it was very good. But, that milk may be retailed to the public under such conditions is a scandal which suggests the desirability of regulating the conditions under which milk and some other articles of food are now distributed to the public. Ten other cases of Typhoid occurred among the customers of this milk shop, and these cases—though not sequential, in point of time, to the case in the milk sellers own family—are explainable on the hypothesis that all were alike affected by polluted milk from this shop. There is some reason to believe that the girl at the milk shop had been ill off and on for some two months before the case was discovered by the Sanitary authority; but the following facts are 32 admitted;—On January 1st, the mother was confined in the back room, and the baby had "a rash" out on it, when a week old. On January 10th, the daughter was prescribed for as suffering from " German measles," and on February 16th, she was pronounced to be suffering from Typhoid. Not till February 28th was the Sanitary authority informed of the existence of this most important case of infectious disease, and them it was found that ten other cases had occurred in apparent connection therewith. No chemical or microscopical examination suffices at present to differentiate milk which has been made poisonous by such pollution. During the year 1879, 64 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. Of these bodies 8 were cases in which disinfection was required, and where the removal of the corpse was probably the means of preventing the spread of infectious disease. In 27 cases bodies were removed from the presence of families mostly living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the living would have lived and slept in presence of a decomposing corpse, and, possibly, a post mortem examination would have been made before the interment could take place. In 3 cases the bodies have been those of casual strangers—homeless, or 33 occurring in Hotels or lodging-houses. Upon bodies lying in the Mortuary 26 Inquests have been held and 17 post mortem examinations for judicial purposes , have been made. The following number of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1879:— First Quarter 173 Second Quarter 172 Third Quarter 81 Fourth Quarter 182 Gross mortality for year 1879 608 Deduct Deaths of Non-Parishioners Dying in the Workhouse 38 Dying in the Throat Hospital 7 45 563 Add Deaths among Zymotic cases removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals 5 Net mortality for the year 1879 568 568 deaths in a population of 33,500 is a death rate of rather less than 17 per 1000. c 34 The deaths occurring in St. James's during the last nine years have been as follows:— Year 1871 Deaths 680 „ 1872 620 „ 1873 629 „ 1874 592 „ 1875 621 „ 1876 573 „ 1877 554 „ 1878 693 „ 1879 608 35 The following Table shows the periods of life in which the deaths have occurred in the last five years respectively. 1875.

Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, March 1st, 1880. 62 REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1870. MADE TO THE Vestry of St. James;s Westminister, BY JAMES EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P. Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James's, Westminster. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, During the four quarters of the year 1879, under the provisions of the "Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, Sixty-seven samples were procured for analysis, and there were submitted by parishioners two other samples. Both the latter were genuine. In one sample of milk procured the dry solid residue was only 6.75 per cent., but it contained 20 per cent. of cream. Another sample yielded 16.3 per cent. of dry solid residue. One sample contained only 4 per cent. of cream, while other samples contained more than a third of their volume of cream. I have no doubt that the proportion of cream which is retailed with the milk often depends upon casual circumstances connected with the measuring it out and distributing it from vessels in which it has been standing a longer or shorter time, and from which at one time the measure may take up chiefly the cream on the surface, and at another may take up the poor milk left by casual and 63 unintentional skimming. In some milk shops the milk is not sufficiently protected from dust and other casual impurities. Nor are the air and the sanitary conditions of some milk shops such as they should be. In no instance was any poisonous adulterant discovered. No money or other consideration, except the stipend paid by the Vestry, has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Piccadilly. London—Printed by J. Miles. & Co., 195, Wardour Street Oxford Street, W
