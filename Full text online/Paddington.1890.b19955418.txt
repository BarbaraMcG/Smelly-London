II, Parliamentary Electoral Divisions. In 1885 Paddington was constituted a separate Parliamentary Borough by the Redistribution of Seats Act (48 and 49 Victoria, cap. 23). The Borough returns Two Members to Parliament, and for the purposes of election it is divided into Two Divisions, 10 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. under the names of North Paddington and South Paddington. North Paddington consists of Ward No. 2, and South Paddington of Wards Nos. 1, 3, and 4. The number of Borough Voters, according to the Register made in 1890, is as follows:— North Paddington 6,137 South Paddington 5,136 Total 11,273 The number of Parliamentary County Voters in Paddington is 102.

The Registrar-General has divided Paddington into two Districts for the Registration of Births and Deaths, called respectively the St. Mary's District and the St. John's District. The divisional line of the two districts traverses the centre of the road in Praed Street, from Edgware Road to the Canal Basin, continues thence along the centre of the Canal Basin as far as the Bishop's Road, and passes Westward from thence along the centre of the Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove to the Western boundary of the Parish ; the St. Mary's District lying on the North and the St. John's District on the South of such divisional line. 11 REPORT, 1890-91.

The resident Justices of the Peace are ex-officio Members of the Board. Paddington is united with St. George Hanover Square, and Fulham, to form a District called the West London School District, the Schools being at Ashford, near Staines. For list of Guardians see Appendix No. V. V. The School Board. In 1870 Paddington and the parishes of St. Marylebone, St. Pancras, and St. John, Hampstead, were formed into one of the Metropolitan Districts for the purposes of the Elementary Education Act (33 and 34 Victoria, cap. 75), under the name of the Marylebone Division of the School Board for London, which Division returns Seven Members to the School Board.

XI. The Vestry. In 1855 the Vestry of Paddington was reconstituted as the Local Authority of the Parish by the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Victoria, cap. 120). The Vestry is the Board of Works for Paddington, and consists of Seventy-two Elected Members and the Vicar of Paddington, who is ex-officio Chairman of the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Vestry are held at the Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, Paddington Green, on the first and third Tuesdays in each month, the third Tuesday in August and the first Tuesday in September excepted. In 1852 the Vestry resolved to erect a new building for the Municipal purposes of tho Parish, and in 1853 the Vestry Hall in the Harrow Road was opened. XII. The Burial Board. In 1854 the Paddington Cemetery, which is situated in the parish of Willesden, was purchased by the Parish. It is managed by a Burial Board, consisting of Nine Members appointed by the Vestry. The ordinary meetings of the Burial Board are held at the Vestry Hall on the first Thursday in each month. For Report of the Burial Board see Section XXXIX. XIII. The Baths and Wash-houses. In 1871 Paddington adopted the Baths and Wash-houses Act (9 and 10 Victoria, cap. 74), and the Baths and Wash-houses erected in the Queen's Road, on the site of premises formerly numbered 143 and 145 were opened to the public in 1874.

XXL — Open Spaces — Paddington Recreation Ground. The visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to the Paddington Recreation Ground, on the 9th July, 1890, was referred to in the Annual Report for last year (pages 132-135). On the 15th July, 1890, upon the Motion of Mr. T. G. Fardell, a Special Committee was appointed to consider and report whether it would bo advisable for the Vestry to take any steps towards assisting the Recreation Ground Committee in securing the vacant land in Portsdown Road for the use of the Parish. A Conference took place between the two Committees, and on the 25th November, 1890 (page 341 V. M.) a report was presented to the Vestry containing full particulars of the scheme for the purchase of the Ground in question, and submitting recommendations which were amended and adopted as follow:— " Resolved—1. That the Vestry hereby agrees to co-operate with the Paddington Recreation Ground Committee for the purpose of securing to the public for ever the Ground known as the Paddington Recreation Ground, consisting of nearly 21 acres, as shown on the plan submitted with the Report of the Vestry Special Committee, and that it be referred to the said Special Committee to give effect to this resolution, subject to the following conditions:— " (a.) That when one-half of the cost of acquiring the land shewn on appended plan, measuring nearly 23 REPORT, 1890-91. 21 acres, for the purpose of a Recreation Ground for Paddington has been subscribed by the outside public, the other half of the cost, not exceeding £25,000, be found by the Vestry under the provisions of the Metropolitan Open Spaces Act, 1881. " (b.) That the Ground, when acquired, be vested in the Vestry of Paddington as the Local Authority for the Borough. " (c.) That one acre of the said Ground be reserred for the period of five years from the date of the acquisition of the Ground by the Vestry, for the purposes of an unsectarian Polytechnic Institute, and in the event of such Institute being established within that time, the said acre of land shall be conveyed free of charge to the Institute when duly incorporated. " (d.) That the management of the Ground be vested in a Committee of twenty-one Members, ten of whom shall be appointed for life and elected by the Subscribers to the Fund in such manner as they alone in general meeting shall decide; the other Members shall be appointed by the Vestry. In the event of any vacancies whatsoever occurring, the same shall be filled up by the Vestry. Every person elected by the Vestry shall retire at the expiration of three years from his acceptance of office, but shall be eligible for re-election. " (e.) That the Ground, when acquired, be open to the public free of charge for admission, and for the purpose of promenading and viewing the games and 24 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON sports, subject. to necessary regulations for preventing obstruction to any games or sports sanctioned by the Committee. " ( f.) That the Committee bo empowered to sot apart portions of the Ground for Cricket, Football, Tennis, and Cycling, or other similar purposes, and to let the same at rents to Clubs, Societies, and others, preference being given to applicants residing in Paddington, and secondly to those in its immediate neighbourhood. " (g.) that the net proceeds of the receipts bo applied towards the payment of the yearly, or halfyearly instalments duo in respect of the half of the purchase-money borrowed from the County Council, and when such debt has been repaid, together with the interest thereon, all such receipts shall be carried to the account of the Vestry. " (h.) That no portion whatsoever of the Ground set apart for games or sports be enclosed by any hoarding or obstruction of any kind, temporary or permanent, which would have the effect of preventing persons frequenting the Ground from having a free and uninterrupted view of the games or sports. "(i). That as a Bill in Parliament will in any case bo required to enable the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Trustees of the Paddington Estate to sell the land, such Bill bo promoted by, and at the expense of, the Vestry, and that it do contain provisions giving effect to the foregoing conditions. 25 REPORT, 1890-91. " Resolved—2. (a.) That as soon as the scheme for the acquisition of the Recreation Ground is sufficiently matured, the Special Committee be empowered to memorialize the County Council to extend to North-West London some of the favour shewn towards other parts of the Metropolis in the matter of the acquisition of open spaces, by acquiring the adjoining thirty odd acres in Elgin Avenue as a Park or Open Space, to be used in connection with, and by way of addition to, the Recreation Ground; thus giving partial effect to the scheme promoted some years back for the acquisition of what was then 80 acres as a Park. " (b.) And further, that the Special Committee be also empowered to memorialize the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the Trustees of the Paddington Estate, the Charity Commissioners, and other Public Bodies, to assist in the acquisition of the extended area." St. Mary's Churchyard North—Entrance from Cuthbert Street. In consequence of the closing of the late entrance to the old Churchyard, from Howell Street, owing to the land being let by the Trustees of the Hall Park Estate for building purposes, the matter was referred to the Legal Committee to secure, if possible, a public way between Cuthbert Street and the Churchyard, and the Vestry has now purchased the Leasehold interest in No. 13, Cuthbert Street, at a cost of £450. c 26 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXII. Electric Lighting. The Vestry having agreed to conditionally withdraw its opposition to the application of the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company (Limited) for a Provisional Order for lighting the Parish, appointed and authorised Col. C. H. Barchard, C.B., Col. H. F. Blair, R.E., together with the Vestry Clerk and Surveyor, to deal with any points arising on the form of the Provisional Order, and to agree to same with such alterations as the Board of Trade might approve. On the approval of the Provisional Order an agreement was entered into between the Vestry and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company (305 V.M.) setting forth the scale of charges for the supply of Electrical Energy, and the Company is now engaged in laying distributing mains and wires in the streets set forth in the Paddington Electric Lighting Order. XXIII. Measures before Parliament. Amongst the Bills introduced into Parliament during the year, the following have received attention by the Vestry. Central London Railway. Housing of the Working Classes. Customs and Inland Revenue. Infectious Diseases Prevention. 27 REPORT, 1890-91. London County Council General Powers. London District Councils. London Water Supply. Rating of Machinery. School Board Elections. Metropolitan Local Government. London Water Meter. Metropolitan Building Act Amendment. Metropolitan Water Companies Charges. Harrow Road & Paddington Tramways. South Kensington & Paddington Subway Railway. XXIV. Deputy-Chairman of Vestry. On the 2nd June, 1890, it was resolved, on the Motion of Mr. Mark H. Judge—" That in the opinion of the Vestry a frequent change of Chairman is undesirable, and that therefore a Deputy-Chairman be appointed to preside at all meetings of the Vestry in the absence of the Ex-Officio Chairman, and that he be elected annually at the time of the Election of Standing Committees ; also that the nominations for the first Deputy-Chairmanship do take place at the next meeting of the Vestry, and the election at the following meeting, provided more than one candidate be nominated." On the 17th June Mr. William Henry Mills was unanimously elected the DeputyChairman of the Vestry for the current year. This arrangement has not only given general satisfaction to the members of the Board, but has been the means of expediting business. c 2 28 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXV. Parochial Accounts. The recommendations of the Special Committee appointed to consider which of the recommendations of the Parochial Accounts Committee could be carried out with the present establishment and without incurring any extra expenditure, were considered by the Vestry, and certain alterations of a minor character were made in the method of presenting the accounts. To organize and equip an entirely new Financial Department would have involved considerable outlay, without conferring upon the parish a corresponding advantage. XXVI. Representation of Wards. A Memorial from Ratepayers having been presented to the London County Council calling attention to the inequality which existed in the representation to the Wards of the Parish, an inquiry was instituted, with the result that an Order was passed by the London County Council re-arranging the representation, without however altering the total number of the Yestry, a step which would have been attended with great inconvenience and expense owing to the limited character of the present Board Room accommodation. A copy of the Order is as follows:— To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington and all whom it may concern. Whereas the Parish of Paddington, in the County of London, mentioned in Schedule (A), Part II. of 29 REPORT, 1890-91. the Metropolis Act, 1855, was, pursuant to Section 3 of the said Act, divided into four Wards, And whereas application has been made to the London County Council, by certaiu Ratepayers of the said Parish, to alter the number of Vestrymen assigned to such Wards, And whereas upon an account taken of the population by the Authority of Parliament, in the year One thousand eight hundred and eightyone the relative number of inhabited houses in the several Wards of the said Parish are found to have varied from those shown by the last previous census, And wnEREAS the London County Council have taken into consideration the said application, Now the London County Council do hereby, by virtue of the powers contained in Section 5 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and in Section 40 of the Local Government Act, 1888, and of every other power and authority enabling them in this behalf', Resolve, Order, and Determine that the number of the Vestrymen assigned to the several Wards of the said Parish of Paddington be the numbers following, that is to say:— No. of Ward. Vestrymen. Vestrymen 1 15 to remain as at present 15 2 30 instead of „ 24 3 15 instead of „ 18 4 12 instead of „ 15 72 72 Dated the 13th day of March, One thousand eight hundred and ninety-one. Sealed by Order L. s. H. DE LA HOOKE, Clerk of the London County Council. 30 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. XXVII. Three Polling Stations for Ward 2. On the 15th July, 1890, the Vestry Resolved, on the Motion of Mr. T. G. Fardell, L.C.C.—" That, with a view of meeting the expressed wishes of Ratepayers, the Churchwardens be requested to provide at all future Vestry Elections three PollingStations for Ward 2." This request was complied with, and the Election of May, 1891, carried out in the manner suggested. XXVIII. Barrable's Bequest. The legacy received from the estate of the late Mr. Barrable, viz., £1,000 (less duty 10 per cent.), the dividends of which are to be applied for the benefit of the poor of this Parish in such form as the Vestry shall in their absolute discretion think fit, has been placed on deposit at the London and County Bank, Bays water Branch, in the joint names of the Manager (Mr. G.

Quinquennial Re-Assessment, The Assessment Committee reported on the 31st October, 1890, that they had attended 31 meetings, and heard and determined 3,554 Appeals (reductions being made in 1,444 cases); also that Messrs. Dobbin & Cooke had succeeded in arranging, on a fair and equitable basis, the assessments relating to the works belonging to the Public Companies. Three Appeals were made to Assessment Sessions, and are still pending. The following Statement contains the Gross and Rateable Values of the old and new Assessments of the properties in question:— Public Companies. Old Value. New Value. Gross. Rateable. Gross. Rateable.

Appeals against the Valuation Lists of various Parishes and Unions have been made by the London County Council, and considerable expense incurred thereby. The Council has not taken any action with reference to the Assessment of this Parish, which may be regarded as evidence of the satisfactory manner in which the Overseers and Assessment Committee have carried out their very onerous and complicated duties.

On the 17th March, 1891, a Deputation waited upon the Vestry and presented a Memorial asking that the proper stops might be taken for submitting to a vote of the Burgesses the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts.

The following Resolution of the Vestry is still under consideration of the Legal Committee:— " That it be referred to the Legal and Parliamentary Committee to consider and report as to whether any, and if so, what better arrangements can be made for preserving and utilizing the books and papers acquired by the Vestry from time to time." XXXIII. Poor Rate Accounts. The Local Government Board in November, 1890, forwarded to the Vestry a draft of proposed Regulations prescribing the mode of keeping the Poor Rate Accounts, but owing to certain alterations and suggestions made to the Local Government Board, the proposed order will remain in abeyance until such time as the Local Government Board shall have fully considered the recommendations and suggestions brought under their notice.

The Vestry passed a resolution to wood-pave Queen's Road, from Bishop's Road to the Bayswater Road; the macadamized surface was broken up, the useable portion of the macadam being mixed with Thames Ballast and Portland Cement to form the foundation. The levels were altered so as to improve the general surface of the roadway, which formerly was of a very inconvenient and unsightly appearance in consequence of the levels of the two footways not being uniform. The entire length of footways were relaid, and the kerb bedded on a concrete foundation. Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining satisfactory wood blocks from the Contractors, and serious delays took place from time to time owing to non-delivery, thus causing waste of time, additional expense, and great inconvenience to the public generally, owing to the roads being closed for a longer period than they should have been. 62 Borough of Paddington.

In the month of January, 1890, I was instructed to prepare an Approximate Estimate of the cost of putting the footways in a complete state of repair. With this view, an estimate was made of about 70 of the streets that greatly needed attention, and in April the Vestry determined to carry out this work, passing the following resolution:— "That the footways referred to in pages 7, 8, "and 9 of the Report be put in a proper "state of repair, and that the sum of £2,500, Report, 1890-91. 63 "for footway paving repairs, be included in "the Approximate Estimate of April, 1890, "and in each subsequent Approximate "Estimate until the whole of the footways "in the Parish are in a thorough state of "repair; further, that the Works Committee "do report to the Vestry as to the work "proposed to be done in each half-year, with "estimates, before the work is put in hand." Since the passing of this order, the undermentioned footways have been relaid and repaired, new Yorkshire stone being used where necessary, and every endeavour will be exercised to push forward this work as rapidly as possible:—Carlton Terrace, between Carlton Bridge and Fermoy Road; Carlton Bridge; Great Western Road, by Kensal Road; Harrow Road, on South side, from North Wharf Road to Hermitage Street; Queen's Road; Carlton Road; Edgware Road, from Praed Street to the "Red Lion" P.H.; Clifton Place, North side; Harrow Road, on North side, from Chichester Place to Westbourne Terrace North; Leinster Gardens; Cleveland Square, South and West sides; Cleveland Gardens, North side; and Connaught Place. The Victoria stone paving laid down in May, 1889, seems to answer most admirably, and as regards its durability it is quite equal to York stone, and more uniform in wear.

The following Plans, &c, of Railways, Tramways, and Electric Lighting Schemes were deposited in November, and considered by the Works and Legal Committees:— South Kensington and Paddington Subway. Subway No. 1.—Total length, 1 mile, 4 furlongs, and 2.6 chains, is proposed to commence in Alfred Place West, in the Parish of Kensington, close to the South Kensington Station, taking the centre of the Exhibition Road, thence going West towards the East side of the Royal Albert Hall, thence crossing Kensington Road and across Kensington Gardens, entering the boundary of the Parish of Paddington in Kensington Gardens at about 1 mile and 2 chains from its commencement, thence proceeding Northwards under the Uxbridge Road, near the Grand Junction Road, Eastwards following the centre line of the latter road by Westbourne Terrace to Spring Street, under the same to or about the point at which the Metropolitan Railway crosses that Street, crossing over the Metropolitan Railway Tunnel to form junction with— Subway No. 2, which passes Northwards under Eastbourne Terrace, to the Northern wall of the Bishop's Road Bridge Approach, to form a connection report, 1890-91. 67 with the Great Western Railway. The length of Subway will be about 2 furlongs 2.8 chains. The Longitudinal Section shows at the beforementioned junction an alteration of the surface of the roadway of Spring Street, in order to get over the Metropolitan Railway tunnel. Generally the rail level is shown throughout nearly parallel to the surface of the ground, at about a depth of 13 feet. At the commencement of Subway No. 1, and for a length of 1 furlong 9.70 chains therefrom, there will be an up and down line laid in one covered way of a width varying from 18 to 16 feet, and of a height varying from 11 to 9 feet above the rail level. The remaining length of No. 1 Subway and the whole length of No. 2 Subway will consist of an up and down line, each laid in a separate covered way 9 feet in width and 9 feet high, except at points where the Subway is on a curve, when the width will be 9 feet 6 inches. It is proposed to afford access to such Subway by means of stairs, subways, and lifts. No. 1 Subway— Depth of Rail, from surface of ground or roadway :— Feet. Inches.

The Guage for the intended Subway will be the standard 4 ft. 8½ in., and the motive power to be employed will be Electricity, or Cable Power. The Subways will affect the following Roads and Streets, viz. :—Uxbridge Road, Grand Junction Road, Glo'ster Place, Conduit Place, Spring Street, Craven Road, Eastbourne Terrace, and Bishop's Road, and all pipes and sewers, drains and lamps. The Subway is stated to be laid in a Covered Way, but not any plan or description is given of such Covered Way; and I would call your special attention to this fact, that the roadway surface on the Longitudinal Section shows only a depth of about 2 feet from Soffit of Covered Way. The Central London Railway. A portion of this Railway Scheme was before the Vestry last year. It was then proposed to start Westward from Queen's Road, along Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, St. Martin'sle-Grand, Cheapside, Poultry, Cornhill, and terminate there by Exchange Buildings, to form a junction with the Terminus of the City and Southwark Subway. 70 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. This year the Company seek for powers to construct two Railways, viz.:— Railway No. 1.—5 miles, 7 furlongs, 4.10 chains, commencing in the Parish of Hammersmith, at or near the Eastern angle of Shepherd's Bush Green, and terminating in the Parish of St. Michael, Cornhill, in the City of London, in Cornhill, at a point 20 yards or thereabouts, measured in a Westerly direction, from the junction of Birchin Lane with Cornhill. Railway No. 1a.—1 furlong 7.20 chains long, is wholly in the Parish of Hammersmith, commencing at the Northern end of Caxton Road, and terminating by a junction with Railway No. 1, at its commencement, as herein-before described. The Plans and Longitudinal Section show Railway No. 1 to pass under the entire length of Uxbridge Road, in this Parish, for a distance of one mile, 3 furlongs, 6¾ chains. As the Gradients of the Railway are not stated on the Longitudinal Section, I have taken the depth of the rails from roadway surface, as follows :— Feet deep. At the Western Boundary by Palace Gardens, it is shown to be 73 REPORT, 1890-91. 71 Feet deep. St. Petersburgh Place 76 Bark Place 74 Queen's Road 70 Queensborough Terrace 66 Porchester Terrace 63 By Centre of Lancaster Gate 56 East end of Lancaster Gate 43 About 2 chains Eastwards of Kensington Gardens Terrace 45 About 3 chains West of Victoria Gate Entrance 54 Near the centre of Hyde Park Gardens 63 Albion Street 60 Stanhope Place, Eastern Boundary 60 This gives the average depth of Rail in this Parish about 61 feet below the surface of roadway. In the Plans submitted last year the average depth was only 44 feet. The up and down lines of the proposed Railway are intended to be placed in separate tunnels, each circular in section, and 11.5 feet internal diameter, with enlargements at the Stations, and it is proposed to afford access to the Railway by means of stairs and lifts. It is not intended to alter the surface level of any road or street. The limits of deviation appear to be the kerb line on the North side of Uxbridge Road, to the Park and 72 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Kensington Gardens railings, and at the following places houses are included in the limits, probably for the situation of Passenger Stations : — Queen's Road, at the Southern end. East side. —3 Houses. 1 House and Private Yard, and A Building at the rear of the Black Lion P. H., Bayswater Road. West side.— 3 Houses. In Coburg Place.—4 Houses and 7 Premises in a portion of Stanhope Terrace, Bayswater Road. The guage of the Railway will be the standard 4 ft. 8½ in., and the motive power to be employed, Electricity, or any mechanical power (other than steam locomotives). The formation of this Railway will probably affect the following public streets. Bayswater Road.—Footpaths, crossings, refuges, and lamps, cab-stands, and drinking troughs. Queen's Road.—Footpaths, road and crossing at South end. Vincent Place. And all streets running at right angles to the Bayswater Road. Memo.— Both Railway Companies ask for the usual power to cross, stop up, close for traffic, alter, remove, REPORT, 1890-91. 73 divert, deviate, and otherwise interfere with, temporarily or permanently, within the limits of lateral deviation, any road, street, highway, crossings, sewer, drains, pipes, wires, &c., yards, passages, houses, shops, areas, cellars and premises, cab-ranks, drinking fountains, and urinals. Harrow Road and Paddington Tramways Extension. The Harrow Road and Paddington Tramways Company intend to make application to Parliament this Session, for power to construct and maintain the following Tramway extensions: — Tramway No. 1.—A double and single line commencing in the Harrow Road, being a junction with the existing Tramway of the Company, at, or near, the end of Amberley Road, and passing thence in an Easterly and South-easterly direction along the Harrow Road, to, and terminating in that Road, at a point 1½ chains West of Edgware Road. Length—1 mile, 2 furlongs, 8.5 chains. The single line will be at the following points— ½ chain Eastwards of Amberley Road junction, 6 chains Westwards of Howley Place by Canal Bridge, 1 furlong, 7½ chains from North of Fulham Place to St. Mary's Square and Hermitage Street, 1 chain Westwards of termination at the Eastern end. I would draw your attention to the proposed piece of double line on the approach of No. 1 Bridge over F 74 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. the Canal in Harrow Road, near Howley Place, and also to the proposed double line from Amberley Road down the Lock Bridge Approach. If the Tramways are thus carried out at these points, I fear constant accidents will occur. Tramway No. 3.—A double line commencing by a junction with Tramway No. 2, about half-a-chain North of Christ Church Road, Kilburn, and passing thence in a Southerly direction along Edgware Road and High Road, Kilburn, and terminating in that Road at a point about half-a-chain N. of Kilburn Park Road. Length—1 mile, 0 furlongs, 2 chains. Tramway No. 4.—A double and single line commencing by a junction with Tramway No. 3 at its termination, and passing thence in a Southerly direction along High Road, Kilburn, Maida Vale, and Edgware Road, into, and terminating in Harrow Road, at a point 1½ chains West of Edgware Road. Length — 1 mile, 2 furlongs, 8.5 chains. The single line will be at the following points :— From a point 4 chains South from centre of Canal Bridge Maida Hill West, for a distance of 2¼ chains, and from a point S. of Bell Street to the junction in Harrow Road, 2 chains. Tramway No. 5.—A double and single line commencing by a junction with the existing Tramway of the Company in Harrow Road near the "Prince of Wales" Public House, and at the South end of Walter- REPORT, 1890-91. 75 ton Road, passing in a Northerly direction along that Road, and terminating by a junction with the existing Tramway at the Northern end of Chippenham Road. Length—2 furlongs, 5 chains. The double line will commence at a point 71 chains North of the junction with the Harrow Road Tramway by the "Prince of Wales" Public House, and will be continued to within one chain of the junction of the Tramway in Chippenham and Malvern Roads. Tramway No. 6.—A double line commencing in Cambridge Road by a junction with the existing Tramway of the Company at its termination, thence into Carlton Road, and in an Easterly direction along Kilburn Park Road, at the North-east end dividing out on each side of the cab-rank there into the Edgware Road, and terminating by a junction with Tramway No. 3. Length—2 furlongs, 6 chains. Tramway No. 6a.—Total length, 1 chain, being a connecting link between Tramways Nos. 3 and 4. The Company also propose to extend their line at the present Western end by Willesden Lane to Stonebridge Park. The Company also apply for the following powers:— To widen the Harrow Road on its North-east side between points respectively 1 chain South-east of Porteus Road by Messrs. Pickford's stables and a point opposite Dudley Street, and when the said F 2 76 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. widening is constructed, to authorise the Company to lay as much of Tramway No. 1 as lies between the points aforesaid as a double line of Tramway along the centre of such road. For all or any of the purposes of the intended Act, and for the general purposes of their undertaking, to purchase or acquire by compulsion or agreement, and to hold, sell, and let lands and houses or easements therein, and to erect offices, buildings, or other convenience on any such lands. When, by reason of the execution of any work affecting the surface or soil of any street, road, or thoroughfare, or otherwise, it is necessary or expedient to remove or discontinue the use of a Tramway or any part thereof, to make in the same or any adjacent street, road, or thoroughfare, in any parish or place mentioned in this notice, and to maintain so long as occasion may require, a Temporary tramway, or temporary Tramways, in lieu of the Tramway or part of a Tramway so removed or discontinued to be used or intended so to be. To provide for the repayment and release of the deposit-fund mentioned in the Harrow Road and Paddington Tramway Act, 1886, and for the abandonment of the portion of Tramway No. 2, authorised by that Act, between its authorised commencement at the " Prince of Wales" Hotel, in the Cambridge Road, and report, 1890-91. 77 the commencement of the intended Tramway No. 1 as before described. The intended Act will incorporate the whole or some of the provisions of the Tramways Act, 1870, with such alterations and amendments as may be deemed expedient, and will enable the Company to exercise the powers granted by that Act as well as the powers hereinbefore mentioned, and will alter and amend as far as may be necessary the Harrow Road and Paddington Tramway Act, 1886, and any other Act or Acts relating to the Company or their undertaking. West London Tramways. Tramway No. 12—a portion of which only affecting this parish will commence by a junction with Tramway No. 11, in Uxbridge Road, by the West London Junction Railway Bridge, passing thence Easterly along Uxbridge Road and Northerly along Norland Road, and Easterly along Latimer Road, Bramley Road, Lancaster Road, and Northerly along All Saints' Road and Tavistock Road, and terminating there at a point opposite the South-east corner of the "Metropolitan" Public House, Westbourne Park. The only portion in this parish will be a proposed double line extending from the Western Boundary and passing by St. Luke's Church, by St. Luke's Road, passing Eastwards from such road for a length of 78 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. about 4½ chains, then a single line for a length of about 4½ chains to its termination. Total length in Paddington being about 9 chains. The Guage will be the standard 4 ft. 8½, in. The streets interfered with will be Tavistock Road, and a portion of the intersection by Tavistock Crescent. Paddington and Bayawater Electric Light and Power Supply Company, Limited. An application to the Board of Trade under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888, for a Provisional Order to authorise the above Company to supply Electricity for public and private purposes in the Parish of Paddington ; power to construct works, to make charges, to acquire lands, and make arrangements with Local Authorities, to open streets and lay Electric Lines. The Undertakers ask for power to break up and pass over, along, across, or under the several railways, canals, and tramways in the Parish; to purchase, hold, or acquire, or take on lease, land, &c., for the purpose of the said Order; to construct, provide, and lay down the necessary plant; to open, and break up the soil and pavement of the several streets within the area of supply ; to take up, relay, divert, and alter drains, sewers, mains, and all pipes, &c. REPORT, 1890-91. 79 New Sewer Works. New brick sewers, 1,225 feet in length, and 3 ft. 9 in. by 2 ft. 6 in. sectional area, have been constructed by Mr. E. Vigers in the under-mentioned roads, for the drainage of new buildings in course of erection there, viz.:— Croxley Road, between Fernhead Road and Saltram Crescent. Macroom Road, between Denholme Road and Croxley Road. These sewers are provided with the requisite ventilating openings, manholes, and side entrances. The whole the works have been constructed under the supervision of the Vestry's Officers. A 12-in. glazed stoneware pipe sewer 240 feet in length, extending from the brick sewer in Orsett Terrace, and continued along the roadway in front of the Houses Nos. 142, 144, 146, and 148, Westbourne Terrace, has been constructed at a cost to the Vestry of £390 8s. 8d., and in which amount is included a pipe ventilating shaft with brick catchpits at the north end of sewer. This sewer was constructed in order that the existing defective drains of the beforementioned houses, having outlets into a 9-in. defective pipe drain at the rear, might be re-constructed with outlets into the new sewer, and with considerably improved sanitary arrangements. 80 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. The total length of sewers now under the jurisdiction of the Vestry is 54 miles, 5 furlongs, and 152 yards. Special Repairs to Sewers. The following are the localities in which old brick sewers have been repaired as specified in my Special Report to the Works Committee, on the 26th February, 1890:— Length of Sewers. Feet. Harrow Road and under Lines'Wharf 78 Bayswater Road, from Ossington Street to Western Boundary of the Parish 120 Market Street, West of Sale Street to Cambridge Place 688 Hyde Park Gardens 195 Moscow Road from Queen's Road to St. Petersburgh Place 751 Bark Place 20 Salem Road 183 Total length 2,035 The cost of these repairs amounts to £2,010 3s. 9d. The above-mentioned sewers had very defective and irregular segmental or nearly flat bottoms, which allowed a considerable quantity of sewage to stagnate in them, and were otherwise in an insanitary condition. They have now been greatly improved. The old brick inverts have been taken out and glazed stoneware invert blocks on concrete bed laid to proper gradients, portions of the side walls cut out and under-pinned REPORT, 1890-91. 81 with new brickwork to form a narrower bottom, thus giving increased scouring power to the flow of sewage, so that no deposit will accumulate to cause fetid and noxious gases to be emitted from the sewers. In addition to the above special works, the defective pipe drain outlets from houses and other premises, together with the brickwork round same, have been repaired, and the outlets trapped with modern stoneware block flap traps, also disused drain mouths bricked up in the following sewers:— Disused Drain Mouths Bricked up. Drain Outlets Repaired. Drain Outlets Trapped.

To allow of easier access to the sewers in Moscow Road by Ossington Street, and Market Street by Sale Street, new manhole entrances have been constructed, at a cost of £27 6s. 82 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. The sum of £238 2s. has been expended in constructing new and repairing old gulleys in Queen's Road during the laying of the wood paving there, so that the levels of roadway and channels have been improved. Complaint was made to the Sanitary and Public Health Committee by the owner of No. 76, Queen's Road, that the portion of the 9-in. pipe sewer passing under the basement of his premises from Inverness Mews to Queens Road sewer, was in a leaky and insanitary condition, and caused considerable injury to his property. An examination was made by the Sanitary Inspector and the drain found in the condition as stated. The Vestry then ordered that the defective pipes should be taken up, and new pipes embedded in concrete be laid through the premises, and that the necessary works be carried out forthwith at the cost of the Vestry. This was done at an expense of £45 4s. 7d. The Vestry of Marylebone having applied to the London County Council, and received their sanction to lay a 12" pipe-drain from St. John's Wood Road into the Sewer in Maida Vale, which is under the jurisdiction of this Vestry, the same was constructed at a cost of £18 8s. 6d. to the Marylebone Authorities. The works carried out as comprised in the ordinary Sewers Jobbing Works consisted in fixing three hundred and twenty-nine stoneware block flap-traps REPORT, 1890-91. 83 at the outlets of house and gulley drains; also the reconstruction and repair of gulleys and sandpits, the laying of one hundred and ninety-one new stoneware pipe-drains from sewers to old premises in lieu of defective and old brick or pipe-drains. These lastmentioned drains were constructed for private persons at their cost, amounting to £1,411 17s. 5½d. The sum of £2,451 3s. 7d., which includes the before-mentioned sum, was the actual amount paid to the Vestry's Contractors (Messrs. Neave & Son) for Jobbing Works executed by them during the year. In June last the Vestry ordered certain Sanitary Works to be carried out at the Vestry Hall premises, 30 as to improve the existing closet accommodation and drainage. This work consisted of fixing Jenning's patent flush-out closets and apparatus connected therewith in lieu of the old defective valve closets. New drains were also constructed, together with the necessary inspection chambers and disconnecting traps, also ventilating-pipes, &c. The amount expended being £246 10s. 8d. Applicants have desired examinations to be made from sewers in order to ascertain the condition of their private drains, and if possible rectify any defects found in them. This has been done, and the number of examinations made during the year have been ninety-six, and the cost to the applicants £19 4s. 84 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. The old brick-sewers which require periodical cleansing have received the usual attention, the amount of deposit taken therefrom, consisting of grit and sand, has been one hundred and forty-eight loads. The smaller sewers have been flushed with water. The necessary cleansing of catchpits of gulleys has also been fully maintained. 1,520 loads of slop have been removed and carted away. The Underground Convenience at Paddington Green has been very much utilised by the general public since its opening. The gates of the Convenience are opened each morning (except Sunday) at seven o'clock and kept open until one o'clock the following morning. On Sundays the gates are opened at nine in the morning and not closed until midnight. One Attendant is on duty from the time of opening until four o'clock, p.m., when he is relieved by another Attendant, who remains until the closing time. Each Attendant is paid 15s. per week. The official return of the number of persons using the W.C.'s and the Lavatory during the year ending March, and for which a charge of one penny is made in either case, is as follows : — Use of W.C.'s.

New Buildings. Large residential flats are in course of erection, one at the corner of Maida Yale and Blomfield Road, and one in Hereford Road, adjoining the "Princess Royal" public-house. The one in Elgin Avenue, by Lanhill Road, has stabling in the basement portion thereof. Two extensive buildings have been erected as Furniture Depositories, one in Harrow Road, South side, for Messrs. Dixon & Haynes, and the other for 86 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Messrs. Fowler & Chick, in Irongate Wharf Road. Warehouses have also been built on the North side of Market Street and on the East side of Paddington Green. Ranges of eartsheds and stabling have been erected in Harrow Road, between Dudley House and Messrs. Piekford's premises, for Mr. Whiteley. Stabling has also been erected at the West end of Cuthbert Street and abutting on a portion of the Old Churchyard. One corrugated iron Church has been constructed on ground lately belonging to the " Thatched Cottage " premises, at the rear of houses on the East side of St. Mary's Terrace. A portion of a large school building in connection with St. Augustine's Church, Kilburn, has been built on the North-West side of Croxley Road, by Saltram Crescent. The greater portion of the private dwelling houses erected this year has been in the North-Western portion of the Parish, which is being rapidly filled up. Notices for the further erection of new buildings have been received by the Vestry from various Builders, so that as soon as these are completed that portion of the Parish will be entirely built over. The total number of buildings erected during the twelve months is one hundred and sixty-two. 87 REPORT, 1890-91. Orders of Vestry were made respecting the drainage of the above-mentioned new buildings. The construction of the drains from sewers to inspection chambers in forecourts or areas of new buildings, and from thence through the premises, have been carried out under the supervision of the Officers of the Surveyor's Department; the pipe-drains through the houses being tested with water in order to ensure a watertight condition. Re-naming Streets and Re-numbering Houses. The following Orders of the London County Council have been carried out, viz.:— Date of Order. New Names of Streets. Old Names of Streets Abolished. Remarks. 1891. Jan. 24th.. Ranelagh Road Cottage Road, Burry Terrace. 42 Houses re-numbered. „ 31st Carlton Vale Carlton Road Re-named only. March 24th . Palace Court Torwood Gardens The name "PalaceCourt" had been written up some time prior to this Order being made, and the houses numbered as erected. Lighting Department. There are now 1,994 ordinary lamps, each burner is estimated to consume 4.6 cubic feet per hour; they have been alight for 3,879 hours each during the year, 88 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. or on an average of 10.73 hours per night. The actual consumption of gas per lamp per annum has been 18,107 cubic feet. A meter is attached to one lamp in twenty, which gives about 98 meters, the average of their monthly readings are taken as the consumption of each ordinary lamp. The Gas Light and Coke Company are paid for the gas supplied on this basis, at 2s. 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet. The lamp service pipes up to the foot of the lamp column are maintained by the Gas Company, and during the year notices were sent them of 190 defective services, which they attended to at once. Refuge Lamps.—The position, power, and number of these lamps will be found in the accompanying return. See appendix sheet L. Damages to Lamp-posts.—During the year ten lamp-posts were knocked down, 23 columns broken, 26 head-irons and 24 lanterns broken and damaged by various parties through carelessness or accidents. Electric Lighting. In August, 1890, the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, obtained an Act of Parliament to confirm certain Provisional Orders made by the Board of Trade, under the Electric Lighting Acts 1882 and 1888, relating to Paddington; and on the 1st of December they commenced laying 3" and 5" cast-iron mains under the public footways, for the purpose of 89 REPORT, 1890-91. carrying their supply cables. The frosty weather stopped their progress for a few weeks in January, but since then they have made considerable advancement with their work. Dusting Department. During the year 5,313 horses and vans have been engaged in collecting 22,352 loads of dust and ashes, giving a daily average of 72.57 loads per working day, or 4.22 loads per horse per day. From this quantity of rough dust 13,590 chaldrons of ashes, 9,584 chaldrons of breeze, 21½ tons of coals, 19 boats and 18 cart-loads of hard core, 3,954 tons of soft core, 52¼ tons of bones, 100 tons of rags, 40 tons of old iron, 3¾ tons of various metals, 15¾ tons of white glass, and 23½ tons of green glass, have been extracted from the before-mentioned number of loads. In consequence of the very severe winter during December and January, the canal traffic was entirely stopped for forty days, causing the greatest inconvenience, nuisance, and extra expense in having to deposit the ashes, breeze, and especially the soft core on the Wharves. In fact, had the frost continued for another week, the collection of the dust in the Parish must have been discontinued, owing to the Wharves being entirely blocked with the accumulations. In former reports I have several times mentioned that the disposal of house refuse, sooner or later, must be G 90 BOROUGH Of PADDINGTON. by cremation, and I think the day is not far distant when the Vestry will have to seriously consider this important matter. Slopping Department. All the dry sweepings, slop, &c., collected by the Vestry's own men is brought to the Depot. The latter, when in a fluid state, being deposited in the filtering tanks, so that the water may drain away, the residue-mud being placed into boats and taken away by Canal beyond Southall, under a contract with Messrs. Studds, at 1s. 4½d. per ton, such amount including haulage, tonnage, and shoot. The quantity collected from the various thoroughfares in the Parish during the year was 30,049 loads, being an excess over former years owing to the wet summer and the severe winter weather. The maximum number of loads of slop and snow brought in in one week being 2,245 and the minimum 158, giving a daily average throughout the year of 97.24 loads. By Canal 26,659 tons of slop, &c., has been boated away in 767 boats; 7,826 horses and vans have been employed collecting, averaging daily 25.37, or at the rate of 3.78 loads per horse per day. Cleansing the Public Streets. This work is carried out by gangs of sweepers, and whenever practicable by horse-scraping and 91 REPORT, 1890-91. sweeping machines, also by the employment of street orderly boys. The main thoroughfares and most important streets are swept daily, especially the woodpaved roads—periodically the latter are washed and cleansed—other roads, where the traffic is not so great, are swept two or three times weekly, as occasion requires. Frosty Weather and Snow Clearing. I may mention that the frost set in about the end of October, and continued more or less throughout November, December, and January. Snow first began to fall on the 18th of December, on which date the Canal was frozen up and the traffic stopped, and this continued for a space of forty days. On the 27th and 28th of December, 4 to 5 inches of snow fell, the weather was extremely cold, and the frost continued till the 22nd January, 1891, with occasional slight snow falls. February was fairly fine, but from the 16th to the 22nd, a dense fog surrounded the Metropolis. March came in bright, fair and dry, the water carts being sent out for five days ending on the 7th of the month; then the weather changed, and on the 11th 4 inches of snow fell, accompanied with very cold winds and sharp frosts. Everything was done to clear the public thoroughfares. A fall of snow invariably calls forth many unnecessary complaints and impracticable suggestions, and numerous persons take the matter up very warmly, and amuse themselves by G 2 92 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. writing to the public press; but in no instance can a single practical suggestion be found that would assist local authorities in grappling with the inconvenience. The following simple calculations ought to convince any reasonable person how utterly impossible it is to clear the streets, or even partially clear them in this parish, or any other parish, in a few days, without incurring a most unjustifiable expenditure. For instance, the first and most important matter, irrespective of money, is to consider where to stack a large quantity of snow at a few hours' notice. A large depot must always be ready and clear, with good roads to travel over, easy of access for working a large number of carts, suitable and proper drainage for carrying quickly away the dissolved suow should a sudden thaw or rain set in; and also, being able at a few hours' notice, to procure the enormous number of men, horses, and carts necessary for the work. Taking four to six inches of snow in depth, and in many parts of the parish this depth is greatly increased owing to the clearance of snow from roofs and gardens, which is all thrown into the roadway, in many instances after the roads have been cleared; and taking an average width of roadway and footpaths at 40 feet; the weight of a cubic foot of snow at 21½ lbs., less 1/3 due to compression in sweeping and filling into carts, this will give about 900 tons, or 1,618 cart loads of 58 cubic feet each, 93 REPORT, 1890-91. per lineal mile, or over the 50 miles of parish roads 80,900 cart loads, equalling in weight 45,000 tons. If a wharf or field could be obtained to deposit this enormous quantity, and assuming a cart will collect far and near eight loads per day to the shoot, it would require 10,111 horses and carts to do the work in one day; the carting and boating away of this quantity would entail an expenditure of at least £12,000. To this amount must be added the work of ploughing and sweeping the streets, stacking, rent of depot, depreciation of plant, &c., which I estimate would be, at least, 1/5 of this amount, or upwards of £14,500. Of late years salt has been freely used by many of the Metropolitan parishes as a speedy relief and assistance in the removal of snow off wood paved and asphalte roads, and a large quantity was used in Paddington. I may mention that this parish does not possess the same facilities as those having easy access to, or abutting on the River Thames, into which collected snow may be readily tipped, as was done by the City Sewers Commissioners, the Strand Board of Works, St. George's, Hanover Square, Chelsea, and other Vestries. In some parishes the snow was shot down the manholes into the sewers, but this practice I should certainly not recommend the Vestry to adopt. 94 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Unfortunately I was confined to my house during the winter, bat I have no hesitation in saying that all worked with a will both early and late, and the incessant work day and night, owing to the variable and severe weather, was most trying; and I believe everything was done to carry out the work in a satisfactory and economical manner. The following General Directions for Snow Clearing will furnish you with information of the proceedings I always adopt attending a fall. These directions have been amended this year, and are issued annually, at the beginning of October, to each of the foremen, so that they may know how to proceed with the work when necessary:— PADDINGTON VESTRY. Highway and Works Department. General Directions for Snow Clearing. Immediately after a Snow-fall, and as quickly as the men can be assembled, start a responsible Foreman and gang to clear the Mail and Cab Route from the Great Western Railway, viz.:—Beginning at London Street, Grand Junction Road to Cambridge Place, Radnor Place, Somers Place, Southwick Crescent and Street, Connaught Street and Square (West side), Hyde Park Square (South side), and Chester Place. 95 REPORT, 1890-91. The snow to be collected after heaping, viz.:— From London Street, Cambridge Place, Southwick Street, Connaught Street, Connaught Square, and Seymour Street, and from all corners of Streets, in other parts, it is to be stacked in ridges, grips being cut every 6 or 8 feet for drainage, all crossings, channels, and gulleys to be kept clean. Plough A. As quickly as possible start the men, horses, and Plough along North Wharf Road, Green Street, Harrow Road to Edgware Road, to the Junction of Praed Street, turn round and go up the centre of Edgware Road and Maida Yale, to the Western Boundary, returning the same route to save time and horses, to Praed Street, which plough to Spring Street, down Spring Street, Grand Junction Road to Upper Porchester Street, Porchester Place, Connaught Street and Square, Stanhope Place. Get a relay of horses here. Go to Eastern Boundary, and then start down the Bayswater Road to the Western Boundary, clear as quickly as possible bulk of snow on the South side of roadway, and heap the same on the Park side footpath, cutting grips 6 or 8 feet apart for drainage, keeping all crossings, channels, and gulleys clear. Eight or nine able men from the road-picking or spreading gang to follow the Plough to clear ridges that are left too high by the Plough at the 96 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. intersections of Streets, and all corners or any other places, so as to make all clear for the traffic. Arrange for gangs of men to clear Praed Street and Craven Road to Devonshire Terrace, and collect snow opposite shops and corners of Streets. The small Scrapers to Plough Eastbourne Terrace from Bishop's Road end, driving the snow on the Eastern side, cutting grips as before described, afterwards go into South Wharf Road in order to get the Railway Van Route open. Plough B. To start from North Wharf Road, down Green Street, turning Westward, ploughing Harrow Road by Paddington Green, Dudley Grove and over Bishop's Road Bridge, Bishop's Road, Westbourne Grove to the Western Boundary, returning back again to the Royal Oak, turning up Porchester Road over the Lord Hill Bridge, going to the left up Harrow Road, over the Lock Bridge to the Western Boundary. Get a relay of horses here. Returning back to the Prince of Wales Public House, through Carlton Terrace and Bridge, Great Western Road, Westbourne Park Road to Porchester Road, over the Lord Hill Bridge, turning to the right, up Harrow Road to Westbourne Terrace Bridge, over same to Bishop's Road. 97 REPORT, 1850-91, Eight or nine able men from the road-picking or spreading gang to follow the Plough to clear ridges that are left too high by the Plough at the intersections of Streets and all corners, clear away from all shops and dangerous places. Foremen of gangs to send men to open up Richmond Road, Blue Omnibus Route. Plough C.

Also open up Amberley Road from Harrow Road, Formosa Street, a portion of Blomfield Road, to Warwick Road Bridge approach, thence down Blomfield Road to the Edgware Road. Gangs to open up Queen's Road, and Clifton Gardens and Road from Warwick Road to Edgware 98 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. Road, beginning at Clifton Road end. Collect snow from shops at Clifton Road, and where requisite in Queen's Road. The snow must be collected from all contracted places, and from fronts of shops, especially by Edgware Road to Maida Hill West, and by junction of Harrow and Edgware Roads to Praed Street, Praed Street and Craven Road, Dudley Grove, Bishop's Road to Westbourne Terrace, Porchester Road, through Westbourne Grove to the Bouudary, as also by Queen's Road, South End, Porchester Road to Westbourne Park, Harrow Road from Westbourne Terrace North to the Western Boundary, especially by sides of the Tramway. Also from all Streets where vaults, areas, or low lying localities are likely to be flooded consequent upon a sudden thaw setting in. All dangerous heaps must be kept down or cleared away from the corners of Streets where there are large accumulations caused by the clearing of the angles. All crossings must be cleared the first thing, also channels and gulleys, and the foremen of gangs must especially see that men are told off to do this work in their several districts. Wherever it is practicable, the snow is to be stacked at the sides of Streets in ridges, the ends 99 REPORT, 1890-91. to be well sloped down to prevent accidents, sloping grips from 6 to 8 feet apart, to be cut through sufficiently wide to admit of foot-passengers to cross the roads, and for drainage purposes. Should the wood paving or any of the roads after snow clearing be found slippery, ashes, fine hoggin, or Thames shingle, must be immediately spread over the surface. Should the Canal be frozen and the navigation stopped, or there is not any space on the Wharves to deposit the collected snow from any of the beforementioned localities, it must be carted and properly stacked, and (if necessary) lighted and watched at night, in any of the following places that are nearest to the point of collection. On the Southern footpath of the Uxbridge Road, by Park Railings. By Garden Enclosure, Connaught Square. Hyde Park Gardens, by Stable Wall. Sussex Square, by Garden Enclosure.

Surveyor's Department, Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, January 10 th, 1891. • Sanding Frosty Roads. The length of time the frost lasted, and the continuous falls of snow, necessitated the men, horses, and sanding machines being sent out during the day, late at night, and early in the morning, scattering sand, shingle, and ashes over the surface of the roads. In fact, both men and horses were quite knocked up with the strain put upon them. 603 horses and carts were out on 46 occasions, the total number of hours being 2,627; 1,292 cubic yards of shingle and 814 chaldrons of ashes were used. 101 Report. 1890-91. Carting Road Materials and General Work. During the year, 2,657 horses and carts were engaged in this class of work for 262 days, giving an average of 10.14 per day; more horses being required this year owing to the carrying out of wood paving renewals and new wood paving works in the Harrow Road and Queen's Road. Road Watering. The water-vans were sent out on 124 days, 3,978 horses and vans being engaged, giving an average of 32.08 per day. The quantity of water used and the cost thereof, including that used for road-making purposes, being as follows:— Gallons.

The mortality amongst the horses has been very great during the end of December and early part of January, owing to the exceptionally severe weather. Influenza in its severest form was most prevalent, not only in the Vestry's stud, but generally throughout London. Every care and attention was bestowed upon them, both by the Horsekeeper and Veterinary Surgeon. This has been the heaviest death-roll since the Vestry became possessed of horses, now fifteen years. Horse Fodder. The following Tenders for the supply of horse fodder were accepted during the year, the average cost per horse per week for keep and bedding being 15s. 4.62d.:— Horse Fodder.

REPORT OF THE Commissioners for Public Baths and Washhouses FOR THE PARISH OF PADDINGTON, For the Year ending 25th March, 1891. The Commissioners, in submitting their Annual State- Accounts, ment of Accounts to the 25th March, 1891, duly audited, have to report:— That there has been a slight falling off in the receipts for the Year of £82 16s. 10d., entirely owing to the wet summer. The expenditure, which shows a decrease of £278 4s. 6d., has been kept down as much as possible, notwithstanding the extensive works undertaken, which are mentioned in other parts of this Report. The Comparative Statement of the number of persons using the Baths and Washhouses during the past three years is as follows:— Year. Swimming Baths. Private Baths. Total No. of Bathers. Washhouses.

K 2 140 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. The Building. (Ladies' Swimming Bath). In their last Report the Commissioners mentioned that a leakage had been discovered in the Ladies' Swimming Bath, which necessitated the closing of that Bath. This increased to such an extent that the Commissioners had to call on the Architects for a report, and they suggested "the laying of a drain just above the level of the area on the Commissioners' side of the wall, and beneath the concrete of the Bath." This, however, had no effect, and the Commissioners therefore determined themselves to take the matter in hand. On taking up a part of the Bath it was found that when the same was enlarged in 1874 the screeds had been left in, and had decayed; and that the concrete was found to be cracked in several places, through which the water was running away at the rate of about 1,000 gallons an hour. It was also discovered that the concrete of the added portion of the Bath was of a less thickness than the older part. As there was no time to be lost, the season having already commenced, the Commissioners at once had the whole of the defective part removed and renewed with concrete of a proper thickness. The work was satisfactorily completed on the 5th May, and the Bath re-opened, the expense incurred under this head being £344 7S. 3d- (Sanitary Work.) In order to complete the sanitary improvements commenced last year, extensive works have been executed at a cost of £192 13s., and the Commissioners consider that the Building is now in a state of sanitation quite up to the requirements of modern science. 141 REPORT, 1890-91. On the 3rd February it was reported that the plates on the under part of one of the boilers had been found to be worn out. On a thorough investigation being made, and in order that there might be no stoppage of the work of the Institution, it was resolved that the brick-work should be removed, the defective plates cut away, and new ones inserted. The boilers have been in constant work, night and day, since the opening of the Baths in 1874 (17 years), and the Commissioners feel it is quite possible that during the next year it may be necessary to have the whole of them renewed. Machinery. The other parts of the machinery are in satisfactory working order, the new engine purchased last year adding greatly to the efficiency of this department. In the quinquennial re-assessment of the Parish this year the assessment of the Baths was raised by the Overseers from Gross Value £100, Rateable Value £84, to Gross Value £2,000, Rateable Value £1,668. The Commissioners felt that this was an excessive charge, and entered an appeal before the Assessment Committee, when the same was reduced to Gross Value, £1,500, Rateable Value, £1,250. Assessment. This will entail an increase in the expenditure on Rates Account of about £260, and seriously hamper the resources of the Institution. Sunday Closing. Upon an examination being made of the receipts during the past three years, it was found that the opening 142 BOROUGH OF PADDINGTON. of the Baths on Sunday mornings during the months of November, December, January, and February, was practically attended with loss on the working expenses account, and the Commissioners, on the 1st December last, decided to keep the Baths closed on Sunday mornings until the end of February, at the same time extending the hour for closing the Baths on Fridays from 8.30 till 9, p.m., and Saturday evenings from 9 till 9.30. The Commissioners regret that owing to the large arrears in the matter of repairs to the Building which they have had to meet during the past three years, they have been unable to partially relieve the Vestry in the payment of the half-yearly instalments of redemption and interest on loans, and with the additional burden now placed upon them for rates, their hope for the future in this respect is uncertain of realization. They, however, feel satisfied that the Vestry will not be slow to recognize the fact that they have effected a saving in the working expenses, without in any way diminishing the efficiency of the establishment, and that, apart from this, the question of finance entirely depends upon weather conditions and temperature.

SANITARY REPORT For the Year 1890. by JAMES STEVENSON, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. Borough of Paddington. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH For the Year 1890. To the Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. Gentlemen, With the return of the Census year the opportunity recurs of determining with approximate accuracy the birth and death-rates in the Parish, of revising the estimates previously made, and of answering with greater precision and trustworthiness the questions which, with multiplied diversity, the study of vital statistics suggests. For statistical purposes, the Registrar-General estimates the population to the middle of the year, 176 and it is difficult to form a correct estimate during the interval between the Census periods. Accordingly, as in 1881, the recent Census shows that, in too many instances, the estimates were incorrect, the actual increase of the urban population of the country haying been much less than that estimated, with the result that all the rates and calculations based upon the over-estimates arc incorrect, and require to be revised. The error has no doubt mainly arisen from the assumption that the annual rate of increase was the same as that shown by the Census of 1881, and partly from not sufficiently taking into account the continuous decline in the birth-rate and the large emigration of the last ten years. During the decennium 1861-71, the population of the Parish increased at the rate of 27.7 per cent., and during that of 1871-81 at the rate of 10.7 per cent., whereas during that of 1881-91, according to official returns, the rate was only 9.9 per cent. In the autumn of 1890, I estimated the population of the Parish as a whole to the middle of the year 1891 at 118,730; the Registrar-General's estimate to the same date, based upon the unrevised enumerated population of last April, is 117,838, the difference being only 898. In the two Sub-districts of the Parish—St. Mary's and St. John's—the difference between the figures of 177 the enumerated and of the estimated population is much greater, more particularly that of St. John's. 1891. Paddington. St. Mary's. St. John's. Enumerated Population 117,838 84,156 33,682 Estimated do. 118,736 82,091 36,645 898 2,065 2,963 I venture to express the opinion that my estimate of the Parish as a whole, and of its two Sub-districts, more nearly represents the actual population of Paddington than do the figures of the RegistrarGeneral. It is to be borne in mind that the Census was taken on Sunday, the 5th day of April, one week after the Bank Holiday, that such of the parishioners as are in the habit of going out of town from Saturday to Monday would not be included in the enumeration, nor would the much larger number of those who prolonged their holidays beyond the 5th April. These remarks apply to the Parish as a whole and to its two Sub-districts, more particularly to that of St. John's, in which the more leisured and wealthier parishioners usually reside. The Superintendent Registrar of the Parish assures me that, in a large number of the houses in the South part of the Parish, at the time the Census was taken, there were only the servants in occupation, the families being out of town. In 1871, the enumerated population of St. John's Sub-district was 38,085; in 1881 it was 37,330, showing a decrease of 755; and in 1891 it is returned as 33,682, showing a further decrease of 3,648 since 1881. 178 In my first Annual Report (1875) I said: "It is not unlikely that we may see in St. John's what is taking place in the central districts of the Metropolis, viz., a decrease of population, arising not from the same causes—the incursion of railways, the opening up of new streets, &c.—but from the wealthy displacing the more numerous poor;" thus showing that I had anticipated a decrease in the population of St. John's, but not to the extent indicated by the official figures. Believing, for the reasons above stated, the official (Census) figures to be incorrect, I cannot accept them, and have throughout this report based the calculations upon the estimated population. Births and Deaths. During the fifty-three weeks of the registration year 1890, ending 3rd January, 1891, 2,901 births and 2,326 deaths were registered in Paddington. Births. Of the 2,901 births, comprising 1,443 male and 1,458 female children, 2,389 occurred in St. Mary's and 512 in St. John's Sub-district. The proportion of males to females among the children born in the Parish was 100 males to 101 females, whereas in the Metropolis it was 100 males to 97 females. The births were most numerous during the first and least so in the fourth quarter of the year. 179 The ratio of births to the entire population of the Parish was 1 to every 41 inhabitants, or 24.4 per 1,000 inhabitants of all ages. In St. Mary's Sub-district the ratio of births to the population was 1 to every 34 inhabitants, or 29.1 per 1,000 living. In St. John's the ratio of births to population was 1 to 72, or 14.0 per 1,000 inhabitants. Some of the preceding particulars are shown in the subjoined table:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1,000. St. Mary's 82,091 2,389 1 to 34 29.1 St. John's 36,645 512 1 to 72 14.0 Paddington 118,736 2,901 1 to 41 24.4 The Birth-rate for London was 29.1 per 1,000 „ „ England & Wales was 30.0 „ Deaths. The total number of deaths registered in Paddington during the year was 2,326. Of this number, 280 were of non-parishioners who died in St. Mary's Hospital, 39 were of non-parishioners who died in the Children's Hospital, and 3 were of non-parishioners who died in the Lock Hospital, making a total of 322 non-parishioners who died in the parish. Deducting these non-parishioners, it will be seen that 2,004 parishioners died actually in Paddington. 180 To this number must be added the deaths of 100 parishioners in extra-parochial hospitals and public institutions, making a corrected total of 2,104—1,029 males and 1,075 females—equivalent to an annual death-rate of 17.7 per 1,000 inhabitants. The natural increase of population from the excess of births over deaths was 797, as compared with 1,199 in the previous year. Of the 2,104 deaths, 1,602 occurred in St. Mary's and 502 in St. John's Sub-district. The deaths in St. Mary's include 30—14 males and 16 females—in the Workhouse, and 142—82 males and 60 females—in the Paddington Infirmary. The deaths were most numerous during the first, and least so in the third quarter of the year. The following table shows the ratio of deaths to the population, together with the death-rate per 1,000 of the population of the parish and of its two Subdistricts:— Sub-Districts. Estimated Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Death Rate per 1,000.

The 100 deaths of parishioners—76 from St. Mary's Sub-district and 24 from St. John s —which occurred in 1890 in the following extra-Parochial Hospitals and Institutions, are throughout this Report dealt with in the same manner as if they had actually taken place in the Parish, and are assigned in the Tables to the Subdistricts from which the deceased were admitted:— Hospitals and Institutions.

The rate of infantile mortality in Paddington was 157 per 1,000 registered births. In London the rate was 163, and in the 27 largest provincial towns it ranged from 135 in Portsmouth to 241 in Preston. Zymotic Diseases. Small-pox caused no death in Paddington, nor did any case come under the notice of the Sanitary Department. In London only 4 deaths occurred, being the fifth successive year in which London has been practically free from the disease. Measles caused 77 deaths—65 in St. Mary's and 12 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.65 per 1,000 inhabitants. In London the 184 rate was 0.73 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium (18801889) having been 0.58. In his Annual Report, 1889, the Registrar-General remarks "it is noteworthy that while the mortality from most diseases has in late years shown a large decrease, the mortality from measles has on the other hand, in three of the past five years, been in great excess." During the last ten years, 1881-90, the number of deaths from measles has greatly exceeded that from scarlet fever, the notification of which is made compulsory under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889. Of the 3,291 deaths from measles in London in 1890, mostly of children under 5 years of age, a number nearly quadruple that from scarlet fever, and the highest recorded during the last 50 years, it may be safely affirmed that the greater number were preventable. If preventable, the very pertinent question arises why not prevented ? Not only is no hospital provision made, except to a very limited extent in Parochial Infirmaries, to prevent the spreadof the disease by the isolation of patients, or to protect them from the secondary affections which occasion their fatality, but the notification of measles is not even made compulsory. Scarlet Fever caused 6 deaths—5 in St. Mary's and 1 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0'05 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared 185 with 0.07 in the preceding year. 99 cases—87 from St. Mary's and 12 from St. John's Sub-district—were removed to Hospital, 114 cases being treated at home. In London the rate was 0.19 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.39. Diphtheria caused 45 deaths in Paddington, as compared with 39 in the preceding year; 34 of the deaths occurred in St. Mary's and 11 in St. John's Sub-district. The rate was 0.38 per 1,000 inhabitants. All the houses in which the deaths occurred were carefully inspected, attention being specially directed in each case to the condition of the water supply and to the soundness of the house-drain, as proved either by the water-test, or by the smoke-test, or by the peppermint-test. In the large majority of cases defects of some sort were discovered, and subsequently made good. It must not be inferred from these observations that sewage per se is capable of producing diphtheria. For its production there are probably two prerequisites, a specific micro-organism and a suitable site for its development. Foul air, whether from cess-pools, drains, or sewers, is recognised as capable of producing sore throat, and it may be fairly assumed that such a condition favours the development of the disease, which primarily and most frequently affects N 186 the mucous membrane of the throat, though it sometimes attacks other mucous surfaces and even wounds. That dirt, damp, and insanitary surroundings are conditions favourable to the propagation of the disease and its subsequent development, I am inclined to believe, but that to these must be added the specific diphtheritic virus. In my first Report I expressed the opinion regarding the zymotic diseases that "none of them have any selforiginating power; they are not generated in the system by any abnormal processes of nutrition or secretion ; they are not begotten of dirt, poverty, or neglect, though these greatly aid their extension; they are the product of a distinct virus, conveyed directly or indirectly from one person to another, and they manifest their potency and individuality by producing the same diseases in others." To that opinion I adhere. The localities in which deaths from this disease occurred are shewn in Table Va. In London the rate was 0.32 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.23. Whooping Cough caused 82 deaths—67 in St. Mary's and 15 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.7 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.22 in the preceding year. 187 In London the rate was 0.73 per 1,000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.69. Fever {Typhoid) caused 10 deaths—5 in St. Mary's and 5 in St. John's Sub-District—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.08 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.14 in the preceding year. In London the rate was 0.15 per 1000 inhabitants, the average annual rate during the preceding decennium having been 0.22. Diarrhoea caused 62 deaths—53 in St. Mary's and 9 in St. John's Sub-district—equivalent to an annual rate of 0.52 per 1,000 inhabitants, as compared with 0.54 in the preceding year. In London the rate was 0.61 per 1,000 inhabitants, the annual average rate during the preceding decennium being 0.76. Disinfection. The disinfection of premises, of small articles of clothing, and of furniture, was, as hitherto, done without charge by the Sanitary Inspectors. Bedding, carpets, and large woollen fabrics belonging to the poor are cleansed and disinfected by Messrs. Armfield at the cost of the parish. During the year 174 cwt. was thus disinfected by that firm, involving an expenditure of £261 2s. 1d. N 2 188 A further sum of £35 13s. 9d. was paid for chemicals and carbolic soap, thus raising the cost incurred by the Sanitary Department for disinfection to the sum of £296 15s. l0d. Canal Basin. The water in the Canal Basin was run off on the evening of April 5th, and let in again on the evening of April 8th. 500 tons of mud were removed from the Basin. Nothing was done in the way of further concreting the bottom beyond repairing defects. Water. Paddington is supplied with water by the Grand Junction and West Middlesex Companies, which draw their supplies from the Thames, as do also the Chelsea, the Lambeth, the Southwark, and Vauxhall Companies. The remaining Metropolitan Water Companies are the Kent Company, whose water is drawn from the deep wells, and the New River Company and East London Company, both of which derive their water from the River Lea and other sources. For the purposes of comparison, Professor Frankland, in his annual report to the Registrar-General on the condition of these waters during 1890, includes also the results of similar examinations of the water supplied by the Colne Valley Water Company and the Tottenham Local Board of Health. He states that the weather during 189 the past year has on the whole been less favourable for the operations of those Companies which abstract water from rivers, than that prevailing in the previous year, but that nevertheless the improved quality of this water has been fully maintained. All the samples examined were taken directly from the mains of the several Companies. In addition to the chemical analysis to which each sample was submitted, the temperature of the water as it issued from the main, at the time of its collection, was determined, and the appearance which it exhibited on being viewed in a two-foot tube recorded. Temperature: Although the average temperature differs but little for the several supplies, the monthly variation in the case of the river waters is very great, whilst the temperature of the deep-well water is practically constant throughout the year. Thus the water principally derived from the Thames and supplied by the Chelsea, West Middlesex, Southwark, Grand Junction, and Lambeth Companies, varied in temperature from 66°. Fahr. in August to 37°. Fahr. in December, and the water from the Lea distributed by the New River and East London Companies fluctuated from 65°.3 Fahr. in August to 38°.3 Fahr.in December. The deep-well water of the Kent Company on the other hand, was free from these violent fluctuations, and practically maintained a constant temperature throughout the year. 190 This uniformity of temperature of deep-well water is of considerable importance, as the water remains cool and refreshing in summer, and is less likely to become frozen in the service-pipes in winter. The solid matters in the water are almost wholly composed of mineral substances, which, in the proportion in which they exist in Metropolitan waters, in no way diminish the fitness of the water for drinking. But the salts of lime and magnesia which constitute the principal part of these mineral ingredients are objectionable, not only because they impart to the water what is known as "hardness," and thus render it unsuitable for washing, but also because they cause incrustations and deposits in steam and kitchen boilers and hot-water pipes. The saline matters dissolved in the deep-well water from the chalk is considerably greater in amonnt than those found in the river water, and inasmuch as this chalk-water is sent out in its natural condition by the Kent Company and by the Tottenham Local Board of Health, these supplies contain more solid matter than any of the others. The Colne Valley Company, on the other hand, by treating this chalk-water with lime before delivery, so reduce the solid matter that the latter was one-third less than the amount present in the river waters, and was less than one-half of that in the deep-well waters either of the Kent Company or of the Tottenham Local Board of Health. 191 The small proportion of organic material which the solid matter invariably contains is, on the other hand, of the greatest importance in connexion with the use of the water for drinking purposes. For although the actual amount of this organic matter is generally quite insignificant, yet it may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. Thus the water, both of the Thames and the Lea, receives, above the points where it is abstracted for the purposes of the Metropolitan supply, various contributions of organic matter of animal origin, such as the drainage from manured land, the effluents from sewage works, and even raw sewage itself. This animal matter may at any time be accompanied by zymotic poisons dangerous to health, and although the chances of such substances reaching the consumer are greatly reduced, both by the filtration to which the water is subjected by the Companies and by the care which is exercised in excluding the flood-waters from their reservoirs, yet, in spite of these protective measures, there is no absolute guarantee that the noxious ingredients, which may at any time be present, are wholly removed. Most of the Water Companies are endeavouring to substitute, as far as possible, water from subterranean sources for raw river water, whilst the Board of Conservators have almost completely stopped the discharge of untreated town sewage into the Thames. Table A gives the proportion of organic impurity present in the waters taken from the Thames, the Lea, and the deep-wells respectively, from 1868 to 1890. 192 From the figures there given it will be seen that, the Thames water distributed during the years 1889 and 1890 was superior to that of any former year as regards comparative freedom from organic impurity. Of the water chiefly derived from the River Lea, that supplied by the New River Company contained in every case, less organic matter than that of the East London Company, which was generally, in this respect, somewhat superior to the best of the Thames waters. Table B shows the maximum, minimum, and average portions of organic impurity in each of the waters, the average amount contained in the Kent Company's water during the nine years ending December, 1876, being taken as unity. In Table C are recorded the results of observations respecting the freedom from turbidity or otherwise of various waters, and for the purposes of comparison, the results of similar observations made in 1868 are also included. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES STEVENSON, Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Hall, Paddington, June, 1891. 193 TABLE A.

The Parish of Paddington, with the Parishes of Marylebone, St. Pancras, and Hampstead, form the "Marylebone Division" of the School Board for London. The several Schools in the Division overlap in regard to the areas from which the Scholars are drawn, and therefore it is thought desirable to give in this Appendix the complete List of the Managers for the whole Division up to the 18th July, 1891 :— It may be added that the Members of the School Board are ex-officio Managers of all Schools in their Division, and that the other Managers are appointed by the Board.
