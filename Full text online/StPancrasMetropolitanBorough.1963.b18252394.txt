September, 1964 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting to you my Annual Report on the health, vital statistics and sanitary circumstances of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras for the year 1963. In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health, the report is presented in the same general form as has been done for some years past. This year has been, in the main, an uneventful one in the Department with nothing occurring to give rise to anxiety regarding the health of the Borough. It has, however, been a year of steady progress, particularly in the Housing Rehabilitation Scheme and the fields of Health Education and Care of the Aged. This, the sixty-third Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health is the last one to be published during the Borough's existence, for when the final report appears next year, St. Pancras will no longer have separate identity. The first Annual Report (a copy of which still exists) was made by Dr. T. Hiller, Medical Officer of Health to the Vestry, in 1857, the first report to the Council of the then new Borough being made by Dr. J. Sykes in 1900. His report commences with a list of his staff and bears a striking resemblance to the organisation of the Department today, the only two unfamiliar officers being that of the attendant at the Family Shelter (which was used for temporary accommodation for people whilst their rooms were being fumigated) and the post of messenger then tilled by 'Downes', who did not achieve the dignity of any initials at all. The population of St. Pancras was 243,076 and that year they enjoyed rather warmer, drier weather than was usual. Infectious disease exercised the Medical Officer of Health considerably, there being 7 non.fatal cases of smallpox and 356 of typoid fever, with 63 deaths, the latter being comparable in incidence with the recent Aberdeen outbreak in which, however, only one person died. Five-hundred and eighty-five cases of diphtheria caused 71 deaths and 123 children died of measles Dr. Sykes feeling strongly that this disease should be made notifiable. In addition to action in respect of individual houses, the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890 was used for rehabilitation of Prospect Terrace, Brantome Place and part of Somerstown, whilst an early example of noise abatement was reflected by a London County Council bye-law having regard to noisy animals, Dr. Sykes noting that this might be of use in actions against the owners of noisy fowls. Further evidence of rural pursuits in St. Pancras is the fact that 17 cow houses, containing nearly 300 cows, were licensed by the Council that year, whilst reports by the analyst of some of the milk samples examined make horrifying reading today. l It is interesting that the penalties for summonses that year in some cases showed little change from today, as evidenced by a butcher in the Kentish Town Road being fined £10 and 2 guineas costs for exposing for sale a diseased bullock's liver and in Arlington Road an owner's penalty of £10 plus 7s. costs for failure to supply sufficient water closet accommodation. One's surprise on reading through this report of so many years ago is that, infectious disease apart, the pattern of the work of the Medical Officer of Health remains so much the same although, of course, expanded now in many directions. Within the new Borough this expansion will be even more marked and one wonders what will be the reaction of the Medical Officer of Health of Camden in the year 2028 should he read the pages that I set before you. In conclusion may I acknowledge once again the close co-operation and help the Public Health Department received from the Medical Practitioners in the Borough and from all those officials, both of voluntary and national 'bodies, with whom at one time or other during the year we are in contact. I thank the members of the Council and particularly the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and encouragement in the work, of the Public Health Department throughout the year. Lastly, I wish to record my sincere thanks to all the members of my own staff for their loyal co-operation and help throughout the year. I beg to remain, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, SUSAN M. TRACY, Medical Officer of Health ii METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ST.
