2472 2 Paddington. METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT OF THE VESTRY FOR THE YEAR ENDING 25th MARCH, 1 8 6 0. REPORT of the WORKS EXECUTED IN THE SEWERS DEPARTMENT. By WILLIAM MERRY, surveyor. e REPORT. Vestry Hall, Paddington; June 20th, 1860. Gentlemen, In compliance with the requirements of the 196th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," I have the honor to submit my Fourth Annual Report of the Works executed in the Sewers Department, from the 25th March, 1859, to the 25th March, 1860, inclusive. During the period embraced in this Report, eighty-nine Notices for the erection of 286 Houses, and 105 Stables, have been received, in accordance with the requirements of the 76th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," and fortysix applications have been made, and granted, for the re-construction of Drains to fifty-three old Houses and Premises. These were rendered necessary in consequence of Notices issued by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, or were executed at the suggestion of the Owners of the respective Buildings. In every case where Cesspools and common 32 Privies previously existed, they have been destroyed and Water Closets substituted. The following Sewers have been constructed in the places undermentioned, at the expense of the Owners of Property:— ft. ft. in. ft. in Porchester Gardens 500 run 2 . 0 by 2 . 0 half brick Sewer. Conduit Street East and West 1000 „ 4.6 by 3.0 whole brick Sewer. London Street and South Wharf Road 800 „ 4.0 by 2.6 whole brick Sewer. The following Sewers and one Side Entrance have been constructed in the undermentioned localities, at the expense of the Vestry:— ft. ft. in. ft. in. Glo'ster Crescent North 679 run 3.9 by 2.6 whole brick Sewer. Ledbury Road 160 „ 3.9 by 2.6 whole brick Sewer. Stanhope Place 260 „ 3.0 by 2.0 half brick Sewer.

In Southwick Place, one Side-Entrance to Sewer has been made; and 131 Gully Drains have been constructed in different parts of the Parish, for the purpose of carrying off the surface water. Total length of Brick Sewer constructed, 6660 feet run. Total length of Pipe Sewer, 1158 feet run. Total length of Drain Pipe laid down, 24,000 feet run—the value of these works I estimate at £ 7811. The Sewerage Works constructed by E. Thirst, Contractor, in Devonport Street, Bathurst Mews, Clifton Place, Glo'ster Square, Hyde Park Square, Albion Place, Clarendon Place and Upper Hyde Park Street, are part of the improvements suggested in my Report of the 12th May, 1858, on the condition of the Old Sewers in Paddington. On the 6th June, 1860, two months after the completion of the Contract, I passed through the Sewers in question, and found them in excellent 34 working order. Thirteen Head Walls, where foul gases accumulated, have been destroyed, and there is now a strong current of air passing through the whole of the Sewers in this locality. These Sewers receive during the wet weather (in addition to the ordinary flow of sewage) a large body of storm-water from the main line in Radnor Place, which renders accumulation of filth impossible. I have also to state that the Sewerage Works constructed by W. H. Rowe, Contractor, in Bishop's Road and Westbourne Grove, for the purpose of relieving the Basements of the Houses in Grove Terrace, Sussex Terrace, Royal Oak Terrace and Westbourne Grove, from being flooded by back storm-water from the Ranelagh Sewer, have answered admirably. The recent wet weather severely tested the scheme, especially on the 2nd June, when it rained twelve hours in succession; and although the water in Westbourne Grove Sewer was eight inches above the floor line of the Houses, only two out of the sixty-five Houses were flooded, namely, the "Redan" Public House and No. 6, Sussex Terrace. I have since ascertained that these were flooded in consequence of the private Drain being defective, as it is quite evident from the large body of water which was pent back, would (if the valve had not acted properly) have flooded the whole of the Houses in the aforesaid locality. When the middle level Sewer, which is now 35 being constructed by the Metropolitan Board of Works is completed along the Uxbridge Road, the Queen's Road and Westbourne Grove Sewers should be re-constructed at a deeper level, and the current reversed, in order that the Sewage West of Queen's Road may flow direct into the main line. At the junction of Queen's Road, Westbourne Grove and Pickering Place, the Sewers are only nine feet deep. The stream is exceedingly sluggish. There are long lengths of invert, with a fall the reverse way, which requires about 100 cube yards of filth to fill up these elongated Cesspools to a level with other portions of the invert. About sixteen miles of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from two to nine inches in depth, have been thoroughly cleansed; the hard deposit which could not be removed by flushing, was raised to the surface and carried away in carts. Seven hundred and forty-two Gully Drains have also been cleansed. Jobbing Works, comprising 213 separate and distinct works, such as the repair of Sewers and Gullies, together with other works connected therewith, have been executed by the Contractor to the Vestry, to the value of £1785:12:4. This amount includes the sum of £630:4:10 received from Owners of Property for fixing Traps at outlets of existing Drains, constructing Gullies, and laying Drain-Pipes under thoroughfares taken to by the Parish. 36 In addition to the foregoing details, I beg to state that 142 complaints on subjects connected with the Sewers Department, have been received. They had reference to stoppages in Sewers, Gullies, Drains, &c. With respect to stoppages in Drains leading into Brick Sewers, they have either been removed from the inside of the Sewer, or the complainant has been informed of the exact spot where the stoppage has occurred; and thus expense and annoyance in stripping the Drain has been obviated. This information is furnished free of expense to every Rate-Payer. It has been my uniform practice to give immediate attention to such matters; and I have succeeded, either in removing the cause of complaint, or have been enabled to suggest a remedy for the evils brought under my consideration. I believe that all the information which is in my power to furnish, has now been condensed into this Report, which I venture most respectfully to submit to your indulgent attention. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM MERRY, surveyor. To The Vestry of the Parish of Paddington. 1860 PADDINGTON, Middlesex.

Medical Officer of Health, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Consumption, Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at St. Mary's Hospital, And formerly Physician to the Western General Dispensary. b REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Gentlemen, In accordance with your instructions, I beg to submit my Annual Statement of the measures in operation during the year terminating March 25th 1860, for the removal of Nuisances, and the improvement of the Sanitary condition of the Parish. It exhibits in summary the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee, in execution of the powers conferred upon them for these purposes. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. BURDON SANDERSON. 9, Gloucester Place; July, 1860. 12 A. PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE ACT FOR THE BETTER LOCAL MANAGEMENT OF THE METROPOLIS. During the year terminating March 25th, 1860, 420 Notices of Orders were issued. The required improvements have in every instance been carried out by the parties liable. The Owner of the house No. 14, Paddington Green, having neglected for more than twentyeight days after Notice served on him to construct a Drain and other works therein mentioned, the Surveyor was directed on the 5th of April to construct and complete the same, which was accordingly done, and the expenses subsequently recovered at the Marylebone Police Court.* The following is an alphabetical list of the principal Streets and Places in which Sanitary Works have been carried out under the Local Management Act, in execution of Orders issued during the four years ending December 31st, 1859. *The following is the method of proceeding adopted by the Committee: A Notice, of a purely preliminary character, is first placed in the hands of the owner or occupier, in which he is called upon to execute the works required within a given time. Should he not think it expedient to comply, the Committee, before proceeding to any compulsory measure, requests his attendance at their next meeting. In the event of his failing to attend, or to give satisfactory reasons for non-compliance, a second Notice, of a formal and preremptory nature, is served, which is the initiative of legal proceedings. 13 TABLE I.

Owing to the deficiency of rain during the Spring of 1859, the water of the Canal basin became putrescent at an earlier period than in any former year, in which it has been under my observation. During the calm and hot weather which prevailed in the beginning of June, the exhalations from its surface were peculiarly fetid, and could be perceived at a great distance. In consequence of the urgent complaints of residents in the neighbourhood of the basin, a letter was addressed (June 16) to the Directors of the Grand Junction Canal Company, requesting them to take "prompt and effectual measures for abating to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer, the nuisance arising from the present unusually offensive condition of the Canal basin." In answer to this communication a letter was received dated July 1st, stating that "the water was in a much purer condition than during the previous December" (see former Report) and suggesting "the expediency in every point of view of postponing for the present the running off of the water;" at the same time assuring the Committee that the Company would take every 21 means in their power "to continue the water in its present improved condition." On this, it was resolved (July 7) that considering the noxious state of the Basin, an urgent necessity existed for the immediate use of disinfectants on a large scale ; and a copy of a resolution to this effect was forwarded to the Directors. As no steps were taken in consequence, the Committee determined (July 21) to institute proceedings at the Police Court, Marylebone. A summons was accordingly obtained on that day, returnable in forty eight hours; on the service of which the Directors gave immediate orders for the disinfection of the Basin. During July 24th and the four following days, large quantities of disinfecting fluid (Mc Dougall's) were introduced. At the end of that time the result appeared to be satisfactory, in so far that the offensive principle, if not destroyed, had at least lost its power of becoming diffused through the atmosphere. At the same time it was not less observable than before, that whenever the mud of the channel was agitated by the punting of a barge, or otherwise, the stench was reproduced in its former intensity. As soon as the weather had become sufficiently cold for the purpose, I conferred (September 1st) with the Chairman and Secretary of the Company by direction of the Sanitary Committee, with a view to the immediate letting off of the water and cleansing the Basin by manual labour, as 22 promised on the 9th of July 1858. It was stated by the Secretary that all the sources of supply were now lower than they had previously been ; and on satisfactory evidence having been obtained that both the reservoirs were completely exhausted, no further steps were taken until November 17th. On that day the Clerk was directed to write to the Company reminding them of their promise; this letter was accompanied by a short report from the Surveyor setting forth the manner in which, in his judgment, the work might be most effectually performed. On December 9th the water was allowed to pass out of the Canal basin in such quantity as to reduce the depth by about four feet. About 30 tons of rubbish were thrown out of the basin and carted away. On December 16th the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, accompanied by the Surveyor and myself, waited on the Directors of the Company, for the purpose of expressing in strong terms their disappointment that no satisfactory steps had been taken. We were informed that the Directors had the fullest intention of adopting the best means which could be devised for the effectual removal of the mud from the channel of the basin. In consequence of this interview a portion of the water was again let off, but no means were taken for the removal of the mud. On the 19th of January the Committee feeling that the time most favourable for cleansing the basin was rapidly passing away, directed the Vestry Solicitor to place himself 23 in immediate communication with the Company. This resulted in a determination of the Directors that the basin should be effectually cleansed. On the 13th of February it was emptied and remained empty until the 18th, during which period about 4000 tons of mud were removed. The process however did not extend to more than about three quarters of the channel. In order to cleanse the remaining portion, the water was again let off at Whitsuntide. With the exception of a comparatively shallow stratum of mud which has been deposited in the portion formerly excavated, the channel is now in a satisfactory condition; the state of the water is wholly unobjectionable, and contrasts strikingly with its foulness a year ago. II. The Serpentine. The plan for cleansing the Serpentine referred to in my last report, which was proposed by Mr. Page and adopted by Lord John Manners, then Chief Commissioner of Works, was unfortunately not submitted to Parliament owing to the occurrence of a change of Goverment before the civil estimates were voted. This plan consisted in deepening the channel by the removal of the mud, obtaining a regular supply of water, and covering the bottom with a layer of gravel. On the 7th of July last, the late Mr. Fitzroy having 24 rejected the plan of his predecessor in office, requested Mr. Hawksley to report upon the subject. His scheme, for which a sum of £17000 was subsequently voted by parliament, differed from all which had been previously proposed, in that it was founded upon the assumption, that the only respect in which the condition of the water of the Serpentine required amendment, was the disagreeable appearance caused by the existence in it of minute microscopical plants. This object was to be secured by causing the Serpentine to circulate through filter beds of sand, so that a thirtieth part of its whole bulk might pass daily through the filter during the six hottest months, a sixtieth during four of the colder months, leaving it at rest during the remainder of the year. Of this scheme it is sufficient to say that it has been finally condemned, after a prolonged investigation by a select Committee of the House of Commons; and that in consequence the very extensive works which have disfigured Kensington Gardens during the winter have been abandoned. It is now proposed to sink a well at the head of the Serpentine, and to employ the engine which was intended to be used for working the filtration, partly for pumping water out of the well, the supply from which is expected to amount to 500,000 gallons a day, and partly to pump the water through the conduit from the bottom of the lake to the top, so as to produce a continuous current. It 25 is not proposed to take any means for the improvement of the bed of the lake, until the execution of the works, proposed by the Metropolitan Board, for the complete exclusion of Sewage. III. Disinfection of Sewers. With a view to obviate the offensive emanations arising from gully grates in certain parts of the Parish where the Sewers are insufficiently ventilated or contain deposit, a plan of disinfection was adopted at a cost of about £8. It was applied in the following localities, viz.:—Hyde Park, Gloucester, Oxford and Cambridge Squares; Market, Star, Sale, Porchester, Cambridge, Dudley, Hermitage Streets ; Oxford, Sovereign, Torrington, Polygon and Bathurst Mewses. The plan was so successful, that it is proposed to repeat its application during the present summer in those localities in which it shall appear necessary. In many of the instances above-named it may be confidently anticipated that the improvements which have been made during the past winter, in connecting the closed extremities of Sewers with each other, and thus ensuring the free circulation of air along them, will completely obviate the evil which has been referred to. d 26 IV. Vaccination. The Inspector of Nuisances has reported during the year to the Board of Guardians 234 cases, in which Vaccination has been neglected. He has in every instance given notice to the parents in the form set forth in my Annual Statement for 1858. The results have in general been satisfactory; all the notices have been complied with, without the employment of compulsory means, with the following exceptions. Two children, one residing in Hall Park, the other in White Lion Passage, died shortly after the service of the Notice, of inflammation of the lungs. In a family residing at Kensal Town, two children, whose parents had neglected to comply with the Notice, contracted small pox a few weeks afterwards, and one of them died. In the month of January last, I made with the kind assistance of several of the Public Vaccinators, a general inspection of the public District and Charity Schools of the Parish. The results alforded additional proof, not only that the practice of vaccination was much neglected, but that the existing vaccination was frequently insufficient and unprotective. The following Table exhibits the total number of children examined, and the number found to present thoroughly satisfactory, indifferent, or unsatisfactory cicatrices; and lastly, those cases in which there were no appreciable marks. 27 name of school. No. of Children. Good Cicatrices. Indifferent ditto. Bad ditto, None. St. Mary's, Paddington Green 346 176 62 83 25 St. John's, Titchborne Row 532 207 191 90 44 St. Stephen's, Great Western Road 250 112 87 55 36 Trinity Schools, Queen's Road 390 109 153 68 60 All Saints,' Francis Street 301 156 44 63 38 Total 1859 760 537 359 203 Thus, in St. Mary's Schools, the children were probably un-vaccinated in the proportion of 7.2 per cent.; in St. John's, of 8.3 per cent.; in St. Stephen's, of 12.4 per cent.; in All Saints,' of 12.6 per cent.; and in Trinity Schools, of 15.4 per cent. In the whole number of children, 10.9 per cent. exhibited no marks of vaccination, and 19.3 per cent. marks so imperfect as to afford no reasonable ground for considering the vaccination protective. Notices were sent to the parents of all the children enumerated in the last two columns of the Table. I have reason to believe that nearly all those included in the last column have been since vaccinated, and that in a large number of instances the operation has been repeated. V. Slaughter Houses. In addition to the thirty-six Slaughter Houses which were licensed in 1858, Notices were received 28 of the intention to apply for licenses in respect of five other premises. As regards one of these, notice had been given to the Vestry in two former years, but the applications had been successfully opposed; the opposition was renewed, and the license a third time refused. Of the other four applications in respect of premises not previously occupied as Slaughter Houses, two, although favourably reported on by the Sanitary Committee and unopposed by the Vestry, were also refused by the licensing Magistrates.
