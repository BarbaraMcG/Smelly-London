The Vestry appointed Friday, the 22nd May, 1891, for the Annual Election of Vestrymen and Auditors to supply the places of those Members of the Vestry whose term of office expired by effuxion of time, as well as the following Vacancies occasioned by death and resignation, viz:— South Marsh Ward C. W. Smith, resigned. Stockwcll Ward Charles Fowle, resigned. A complete List of Vestrymen and Auditors for 1891-92 will be found on pages 4—10. Vauxhall Ward J. Crossman, resigned. W. Tongue, resigned. 29 VESTRY RATES AND PRECEPTS. The making, levying, and collecting of the Vestry Rates is done by the Churchwardens and Overseers, upon whom the Vestry makes its Precepts for the several annual requirements of the Vestry. The following is a Comparative Statement for the two years lending 25th March) 1890 and 1891. 1890. 1891. Rate Vestry Precept Rate Vestry Precept. £ s. d. £ s. d.

During the past year the Overseers have made out the Quinquennial Valuation List, and they have also made out and delivered to the Assessment Committee four Provisional Lists, Nos. respectively 1,2,3 and 3a. Notices were served upon all the parlies affected by the alterations proposed by these Lists, and days appointed for the hearing of any objections thereto, when the Assessment Committee, after hearing the various causes, adjudicated thereupon. 1890 being the year for the Quinquennial Valuation List to be made according to the Act, entailed a very serious addition to the ordinary yearly work of the Assessment Committee; as in addition to the appeals on the Provisional Lists before referred to, the Clerk had to send notices to Appellants to attend the Committee on Appeals against upwards of 4000 Assessments in the Valuation List The Committee appointed seven whole days to hear the appeals to the Valuation List, and had other adjourned days to enable the appeals to be disposed of. The Committee had also to sit in October to consider the objections to the List, as revised by the Committee. In all the Committee sat eleven whole days, and on thirteen other occasions, making 24 Meetings in all. After the Valuation List had been made out by the Overseers and left with the Committee, the London County Council invited all the Assessment Committees of the County of London to send Delegates to attend a Conference to be held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, to decide on the general principles to be laid down in settling the Values of Propeity to be inserted in the 31 Valuation Lists. The Committee appointed the Chairman and the Clerk, Mr. Smith to attend the Conference. Some important principles were decided by the Conference, and recommended for adoption by the various Assessment Committees of the Metropolis amongst others, (i.) The Scale for assessing property let on weekly and monthly rents the Landlords paying the Rates and Taxes. (2.) The Scale for valuing freehold and leasehold property in the occupation of the Owners; and (3.) The Scale for assessing the value of public-house property not held at rack rent and for which a single premium had been paid jointly for the premises and for good-will, in this latter case the Conference recommended that one-half of the premium should be taken as paid for the property itself and assessed accordingly. It was unfortunate that the Conference had not been called earlier, viz., prior to the Valuation Lists being finally settled by the Overseers, many Appeals would then have been saved, and the Assessment of the Metropolis would have been made on one uniform basis. The Scales laid down by the Conference were adopted by the Committee in all cases of objections made to them. The Committee actually heard the parties, and adjudicated on no less than 3159 objections, confirming the Assessments in 609 cases, reducing the Assessments in 2533 cases, and increasing the Assessments in 17 cases, the latter being almost entirely public-house cases, owing to the alteration in the mode of assessing the amount of premium paid In 36 cases the Committee appointed Mr. Charles Barker to survey an I report on the value of the properties, and adjourned the consideration of the Objections until his report was received. The result of the decisions of the Committee was that the values in the Valuation List as settled by the Overseers for the gross were reduced from £ 1,921,942 to £1,868,224 and the Rateable amount from £ 1,559,079 to £1,517 810 Showing a reduction of Gross £53,718; Rateable £41,269 32 The Act, as amended by the London Government Act, 1888, provides for two sets of Appeals from the decision of the Committee, viz.:—(1) To the Special Sessions, consisting of a Court composed solely of Surrey Magistrates; and (2) To the Quarter Sessions for the County of London. There was no Appeal to the Special Sessions, and only 6 Appeals to the Quarter Sessions out of the 3159 cases heard by the Committee. These 6 Appeals were as follows: 1.—Mr. Saunders, with reference to property on the field Estate, Wandsworth Road. 2.—Mr. Everitt, as to "The George" public-house, Railton Road, Brixton. 3.—Mr. Cambden, as to the "Atlantic Tavern." Atlantic Road, Brixton. 4.—Messrs. Poole & Winner, as to the “Vauxhall Tavern,” Vauxhall. 5.—Crystal Palace Gas Company. 6. — London County Council, against the totals of the Valuation List. In all the above cases, Mr. Smith's firm was instructed to appear for the Committee, and Mr. Poland, Q.C., was retained to represent the Committee. As to No. 1, Mr. Saunders let out his houses in each case to two separate tenants, and he asked that each house should be rated as two houses. When the case cams before the Committee the Overseers objected to the sub-division of each Assessment 011 the ground that there was only one front door, and that all the rooms of the house opened 011 to a common passage and staircase, and that there was no structural internal severance of any part of the house. Under these circumstances, if Mr. Saunders' houses were separately assessed, all other houses in the Parish let off in rooms must have such rooms separately rated, involving much difficulty and complication in making and collecting the 33 rates of the Parish, and very great additions to the Rate Book. The Committee, at the request of the Overseers, refused to subdivide the Assessments. The Appeal was heard by Sir Peter Edlin, Q C, and the other magistrates, and judgment reserved, but at a later day the Court decided in favor of the Appellants, with costs, but offered to stale a case for the opinion of the Court of Queen's Bench, intimating that the case was one of considerable importance. There is already a somewhat similar case down for argument before the Queen's Bench Division, and unless the decision of the Court in that ease is decisive of the present case, the Overseers have requeued the Committee to accept the offer of a Special Case and have the decision of the Queen's Bench Judges on the points involved. As to Nos. 2 and 3, the Court heard the cases on the March, 1891, and dismissed both Appeals with costs. A* to No. 4, the Appellants, after the decision of the Court in the above cases, withdrew the Appeal. The Appeal No. 5 has not yet been heard. As to No. 6, the Appea1 of the London County Council:— The Council asked to hive the total Assessment of the Parish Increased as follows, viz.:— _ Grcss £7,340 Rateable £26,433 which sums were atrived at as follows:— The whole of the claim for the increase in the gross was in respect of public buildings which had been as alleged underassessed by the Overseers. These consisted chiefly of the premises in the occupation of the Lambeth Guardians, but also included the Vestry Hall, the Wharf in the Belvedere Road, and the Lambeth Baths, Westminster Bridge Road. D 34 As to the claim in respect of the rateable amount it arose as follows:— £6,1oo (a) The alleged rateable value of the buildings in respect of which the claim of £7,340 gross arose. £4,o18 (b) The amount of Government property not included in the Valuation List. £126 (c) The alleged underassessment of 17 properties owing to clerical errors in carrying the figures out, Ac. £16,189 (d) Alleged under-assessment of 16,189 other hereditaments. £26,33 (a) As to the claims of £7,340 gross and £6,1oo rateable for public property, the Committee in order to avoid an expensive and complicated enquiry to the valuation of the properly involving the employment of Surveyors and Valuers, decided not to contest the figures. (b) As to the £4,o18 the amount is entirely made up of the valuation of Government properly which is not rateable, and as the Government pay to the Parish a sum equivalent to the aggregate sum the rates on the property would produce if actually rated, and as the Parish in the past have always given to the London County Council and their predecessors, the Metropolitan Board of Works, a sum equivalent to their proportion of the rates on the property if rated and included in the List, the Committee considered it idle to object to the Appeal as it is of no practical or pecuniary value to the Parish whether the Council be paid by way of rate, as it will be in future, or by way of contribution as heretofore. (c) As to the £126 the Committee of course assented to the correction of what was merely a clerical mistake. (d) As to the £16,189 the same is made up of an even pound 35 sterling being added by the Council to 16,189 separate cases of rateable value in the Valuation List. The practice of the Overseers throughout the List was as follows, viz: whenever the strict rateable value of any property would amount to a fraction of a £. then if such fraction exceeded ten shillings to enter the rateable value at the next even higher pound sterling, and if the fraction did not exceed ten shillings to enter the rateable value at the next even lower pound sterling. This system was adopted to avoid complicated fractions in the books of the Overseers, and as the number of cases over ten shillings was roughly supposed to be equal to the number under ten shillings the aggregate amount of the whole Valuation List was kept fairly the same, and no injury or detriment was caused to the Council or to other Parishes which jointly contributed with Lambeth to the common burthens of the Metropolis. With reference to the whole matter, the Committee, as before mentioned. at once offered to give way for the charge as to the gross and the three first items, a b c, as to the Rateable amounts, but as to the latter larger item of £16,189 (d), the Committee represented to the Council that it would be unfair that they should ask the Parish to bear any part of the amount. No decided reply was received from the Council before the time for lodging the case for the Committee at the Sessions, and the Committee lodged their case submitting with reference to this item as follows:— "Should the Court consider that the Council are entitled to be heard on this appeal the Committee will contend that as the appeal is merely against totals the Committee are entitled to set of! as against any deficiency in the 16,189 cases (all being cases of fractions of ten shillings and under) the excess in all cases Where the strict Rateable value according to the Schedule of the Act would come to fractions over ten shillings and under one pound and in which cases a full pound has been entered in the List as on the whole the total of the Rateable amount in the 36 Valuation List is not thereby reduced beyond its proper amount according to the Act.” "That should the Court decide not to allow the set of referred to in the last paragraph then the Committee will contend that in any case the Council can only require the total Rateable Value of the Parish appearing in the Valuation List to be increased as to the 16,189 cases by the exact fraction over the present Rateable value calculated according to the maximum rate of deduction allowed by the Valuation Act and not by a whole pound in each case as asked for by the Council. Negotiations took place between the Council and the Committee as to a settlement of the large item. The Council at first offered to accept half the amount, viz, £8,094. This the Committee declined to absent to; the Council then agreed to take the actual amount of what the Statutory figure wonld be, or say 5s., or a quarter of the whole amount in other words, ,047. This the Committee also refuse J, but as the contest would have involved an expensive inquiry and calculations in each of the 16,189 cases, and as it was possible (in fact the Committee found it to be actually the case in a calculation made by the Clerk as to two Districts) that upon taking the cases above 10s. and below 10s. the balance would not have been even, but would have been to some extent in favor of the Council, the Committee finally offered to assent to the total of the Rateable amount being increased by £2,000. This offer the Council accepted, on the condition that the Committee paid to the Council the sum of £50 as the alleged payments out of pocket of the Council in connection with the Appeal. This latter condition was considered by the Committee as one which should not have been made by the Council, but rather than have the money of the Ratepayers wasted in litigation as to so small a sum, the Committee yielded and agreed to pay the £50. The Committee consider that the Vestry is to be congratulated that in a Parish Assessment involving over one million sterling, the Appeals have been so few, and that such Appeals will in the end cost the Parish so small a sum of money in proportion to the large rateable amount of the Parish. The costs of the several Appeals have not yet been taxed by the Court, the Committee arc unable, therefore, to report on the amount of the costs which the Committee may be called upon to bear, but will supply the Account in a Supplemental Report. In the meantime, however, it is proposed, that the sum of £50 already paid by the Vestry, should be retained in hand towards the Costs of the Appeals, which must in any case considerably exceed that amount. The value of property in the Parish assessed for the Relief of the Poor has been as follows:— Grots Rateable On the 8th April, 1870, prior to the first Valuation List being made out £1,044,810 ,£848,230 As settled by the Committee by the first Valuation List in 1870 1,121,475 919,015 As settled by the Committee by the first Quinquennial Valuation List in 1875 1,263,046 1,034,710 As settled by the Committee by the second Quinquennial Valuation List, 1880, after the Appeals to the Assessment Sessions 1.574,513 1,284,862½ As settled by the Quinquennial List, 1885, after the Appeals to the Assessment Sessions 1,801,014 1,461,540 As settled by the Supplemental List, 1889 1,838,826 1,490,716 As settled by the Committee by the Quinquennial List, 1890 1,868,224 1,517,810 The increase of the New List over the last Quinquennial and Supplemental Lists is as follows:— Gross Rateable Over Quinquennial List of 1885 £67,210 £56,270 Over last Supplemental List £29,398 £27,094 From a Statement supplied by the Overseers, it appears that there is in the New List an increase of ,£9,027 in the Assessment 38 of the property of Public Companies, and an increase of £15,266 in the Assessment of the public-houses in the Parish.

To enable the Commissioners, if possible, to avail of Mr. Henry Tate's generous offer of a Central Library at Brixton (which offer was contingent on the abolition of the limit of the Rate to ½d.), a requisition from the Ratepayers and Voters of the Parish was made to ascertain the opinion of the Voters, whether the then existing limitation of the Rate should be withdrawn. A poll of the Parish was consequently taken, with the following result: To the question, "Are you in favour of the existing limitation of the Rate under the Libraries Act being removed? "the answers were “ Yes" 9662; "No" 9288, or a majority of 374 in favour of the limitation being removed. A demand was therefore made upon the Overceers to the full legal limit of id. in the ELECTRIC LIGHTING. The applications for Provisional Orders made by the London Electric Supply Co-operation, Limited, and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, were subsequently abandoned, but orders were obtained by the other two Companies, viz., the House to House Electric Light Supply Company for the whole of the Parish, and the Electric Construction and Maintenance Company. Limited, for a very small part of the Southern end of the Parish. BROCKWELL PARK. The purchase of this park was completed by the London County Council, and the site secured as an open space for the free use of the public. The contribution of the Vestry of £20,000 was paid to the London County Council, the money being borrowed from the Council, to be repaid by the Vestry by fifty annual instalments £400 each. The park, which since its acquisition by the Council has been accessible to the public, has not yet been formally opened. 40 LOANS. On the 25th March, 1890, the amount owing by the Vestry was £72,694 10s. 1od. During the year a Loan was obtained from the London County Council of £20,000. for the contribution paid by the Vestry to the London County Council, towards the purchase of Brockwell Park, at the rate of 3½ per ccnt. The amount paid off during the year was £8567 6s. id., leaving £84,127 5s. 2d. running on the 25th March, 1891, of which the following are the details.

WALTER VERDON, M.D., F.R.C.S., Medical Officer of Health, Barrister.at.Law, Member of the Honourable Socitey of the Middle Temple. TO THE VESTRY OF THE Parish of Lambeth, 1890. THIRTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the year 1890 on the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Parish of Lambeth. In pursuance of the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 25 & 26 Vict. cap. 102, sect. 43, I beg to present to your Vestry, a Report for the year 1890, upon the vital statistics and sanitary condition of the Parish of Lambeth. Growth of Population. Before the date usually fixed for the issue of the Annual Report the Census of 1891 was taken, and the returns published. The figures of the Registrar General arc consequently available for the purposes of statistical calculation. The result of the enumeration shows the futility of trusting in even carefully considered estimates of population made in the later years of an intercensal period, and the necessity that exists for the institution of returns at shorter intervals. In the 2 Statistical Department of the Local Government Board during the preparation of the annual estimates, the most careful consideration is given to every incident which may be regarded as having a bearing on the fluctuation in the growth of population. Yet, in spite of all precautions, the estimated returns made for 1890 and the several years preceding it have been largely in excess of the actual population. And the rates of birth, sickness, and mortality based on those figures must be accepted as subject to revision. Official estimates of population are founded on the assumption that the grow th which has taken place since the latest census year maintains the same ratio as that ruling in the intcrcensal period immediately preceding it. Growth is determine 1 by two factors. The one makes for expansion the other for contraction. The balance on England's birth and death account, usually called the natural increment, is uniformly in favour of the former; that on immigration and emigration of the latter. The contraction in the ratios of growth observed during the last ten years results from a shrinkage in the natural increment and from an unusual excess in emigration over immigration. Under these two headings the population in 1890 has been overestimated in a degree represented by the figures 703.350. In the estimates of the population of the Parish of Lambeth the same error has crept into the calculations. It was reasoned that the standard of growth obtaining in the last decennium would have been applicable to this. Sufficient margin was not allowed for the larger balance in favour of emigration. Too much reliance was placed on conclusions drawn from a consideration of the increase in the number of inhabited houses indicated on the pages of the rate books. The estimate of the population of Lambeth, as that of London, has been exaggerated. That the growth has not been so rapid as might have been anticipated by a contemplation of the progress of former years is evident on a comparison of the returns of the latest with former 3 Census years. The latest, indeed, points to a condition which, after the leaps and bounds of the periods preceding it, may almost be regarded as one of rest. The dccennium ending in the Census year 1871 was remarkable for an increase of 28 6 per cent. in the living population. The next, of which 1881 was the final year shows a further gain of 218 per cent. But the growth of the last dccennium illustrated in the returns of the latest enumeration is represented by an addition of only 8.5 per cent. Estimated Population of Lambeth. The population of the Parish of Lambeth for the year 1890 is estimated by taking as a basis of calculation the Census figures of 1891, and deducting from that return a percentage corresponding to the growth of population during the last year of the intercensal period. The actual growth during the ten years is 8.5 per cent. The estimated growth for the one year is .85 per cent. or in round numbers 2,150. With this deduction from the total return, the figure at which the population of Lambeth may be computed is 273,152. During the deeennium ending June. 1801. building Number of Houses. operations and railway extensions resulting in the demolition of houses have altered the conditions of dwelling accommodation in the Parish. In the outer Wards the number of inhabited houses has increased; in the inner, it has decreased. At the beginning of the dccennium in the four inner districts the inhabited houses numbered 10,731; at the end, 9,717. During the intervening ten years in the inner combination over a thousand houses have been demolished and accommodation correspondingly reduced. At the beginning of the decennium in the four outer districts the inhabited houses numbered 24,673; at the end, 28,804. During the intervening ten years in the outer combination 4,131 houses have been built and occupational accommodation proportionately increased. House Population. In the year 1881 the total number of inhabited houses in the Parish of Lambeth stood at 35,404. In 1891 it stands at 38,521; a total increase of 3,117 houses. The 275,202 persons of the Census year occupy 38,521 4 houses. The average rate of occupation is 71 inhabitants per house. There is some divergence between the occupational rate of the inner and that of the outer districts. In the inner districts 85,846 persons occupy 9,717 houses; in the outer, 189,356 persons occupy 28,804 houses. The smaller house of the inner district is occupied by eight persons, whilst the larger house of the outer district is occupied by six. To place the extremes of divergence in the scale side by side, Norwood, the largest subdistrict in area and the most spare in population, must be contrasted with Waterloo 1st, the smallest in area and the densist in population. In Norwood 25,657 people live in 4,116 houses; in Waterloo 1st, 14,031 live in 1,470 houses. In Norwood the average occupational rate is six persons per house; in Waterloo 1st, ten persons per house. Distribution and Displacement of population. The distribution of the population in the eight registration sub-districts has undergone a modification. The degrees of density tend towards a more uniform standard. There has been an overflow from the inner to the outer districts. The population of the four inner divisions has declined. The population of the four outer divisions has increased. But the increase of the outer is larger in proportion than the decrease of the inner. Whilst Lambeth Church 1st, has lost 1852 inhabitants, Brixton has gained 10,568. Whilst Lambeth Church 2nd, has lost 712, Norwood has become more important by an increase in its population of 6,640. The total decrease in the four inner registration sub-districts during the ten years ending June, 1891, numbers 5,435 persons. The total increase of the four outer wards numbers 26,938. The displacement of population from the central districts of Lambeth, and the settlement of population in those districts which are situated in the outer ring or on the circumference of the inner, is a part of a greater movement which affects the whole 5 politan area. The central districts of London in the aggregate and individually, with the exception of Whitechapcl, exhibit a decrease on the last return. It is probable that the single exception referred to arises through the large influx of foreigners of Jewish descent, and to a tendency manifested by those immigrants to make Whitechapcl a place of settlement. Density of Population. The inner districts of Lambeth consist of an area of 515 acres, with a population of 85,846. The outer districts of an area of 3427 acres, with a population of 189,356. The degree of density of the former is 167.07 per acre. The degree of density of the latter is 55.2 per acre. On a superficial area of the same dimensions, living in the inner warJs are three persons, as compared with one in the outer. If the densest district of the inner combination the compared with the sparsest of the outer, the divergence in degree of density is remarkable. Waterloo 1st, with an area of 67 acres, boasts a population of 14,031 persons. Norwood, with an acreage of 1,009, has 25,657 inhabitants. The degree of density in Waterloo 1st, is 209 per acre. The degree of density in Norwood is 25 per acre. On a superficial area of the same dimensions in Waterloo 1st, arc eight persons living, as compared with one in Norwood. Birth Rate. Although the population is greater by several thousands than it was ten years ago, the births registered in the parish of Lambeth during the year 1890 number 100 less than in 1880. Since the opening year of the dccennium a tendency indicating the advent of a less prolific period is observable. Before that time the rate usually ranged in the neighbourhood of the forties. Since then it has dwindled and now hovers about the small thirties. Nor is the retrograde movement confined to Lambeth alone. Having regard to the larger volume of its adult population the metropolis generally has fewer 6 children than formerly in its streets and houses. The metropolitan birth rate of last year was the lowest on record since 1840. Marriage Rate. A shrinking birth rate is the corollary of a declining marriage rate. Popular education and the wider distribution of the comforts and luxuries of life engender a sense of responsibility tending towards the discouragement of early and improvident marriage. The marrying age is becoming later. Notwithstanding the larger number of persons of a marriageable age, the number of those who married in 1890 was smaller than in 1880 by 552. Marriages are postponed, and the number declines through the accidents of postponement. Death Rate. The deaths from all causes registered in Lambeth during the year were 5,942. These figures are the gross. Some parishioners died in hospitals outside the boundary of Lambeth, and are included in the returns of the Parish in which they succumbed to their last illness. On the other hand, inhabitants of other Parishes died in Lambeth. After due allowance has been made for the subtraction from, and additions to the register, rendered necessary by the movements of these two sections during the last few weeks of life, it is observed that 5,842 parishioners died during the year. It is usual in this place to compare the death rate of the Lambeth Parish with that of the combined Parishes and district Boards of Works of the Metropolis. But on this occasion there is a difficulty. The population of Lambeth, the basis of the rate, is estimated on the latest census returns. The population of London is estimated on the old census. A fair comparison cannot be made when the bases are dissimilar. The figures are, however, placed side by side with this reservation. The death rate for Lambeth is 21.3. The death rate for the metropolis is 20.3. But if in the metropolitan calculation, as in that of Lambeth, the latest census returns are employed as a basis, the metropolitan rate stands at 21.8. This, and not 20.3, is the actual metropolitan rate. 7 Death rate sub-districts The death rates of the sub-districts bear some relation to the density of the population. Taking a general survey, the death rate of the inner Wards stands several points higher than that of the outer. But there are disturbing elements which arc difficult to eliminate from the calculations. The people who die in the general hospitals, the hospital of the Asylums Board, and the workhouse, do not necessarily belong to the district in which their death is registered. On the contrary, the majority have been removed from other districts. The deaths of those who die in the public institutions cannot fairly be apportioned to any special district, but must be generally distributed, having regard to the district populations. The average death rate of the four inner districts is 25.9 per 1000. The average death rate of the four outer districts is 20 2 per 1000. Influenza. The unusually heavy death rate of 1890 is in a large measure attributable to the influence exerted on the public health through the incidence of Influenza. Under the heading of that disease itself, 47 cases appear in the returns. But this is not a tithe of the mortality which is traceable to this unexpected visitation In 1889, 966 persons died from diseases affecting the lungs and bronchial tubes. In 1890, from the same causes, 1,850 persons died. The Influenza year claims an excess of 884 deaths, or an increase by 91 per cent. Influenza infcction. As to the nature of the poison by which Influenza is produced in man, and even among horses and cattle, little is known. That in effect it exhibits many of the recognised qualities of the Zymotic poisons is a subject of observation and no doubt can be entertained that it is microbic in kind. The Italians in the eighteenth century ascribed 8 the disease to the influence of the stars: a power from the celestial bodies was supposed to operate on the minds and bodies of men. It received the name of the "Influence," or in the Italian language the "Influenza," a term now generally adopted in this country. The malady, however, in scientific treatises is more correctly described as Catarrhal Fever. The disease is reported to have prevailed in 1729, 1732, 1737, 1742, 1758, 1762, 1767, 1775, and 1782, re-appearing in 1803, 1833, 1837, and 1847. In some of the epidemic years the mortality was large; in others, the attack was milder in type. It is generally estimated that in 2 per cent. of the persons infected the illness has a fatal termination, but in some visitations, when the disease assumes a pernicious type, the mortality rises to 5, 7, or even 10 per cent. There have been differences of opinion as to the manner in which the contagion is spread. Some people assert that it is carried from place to place by the movement of aerial currents, and that neither seas nor mountains, the natural barriers of human intercourse, arrest its course. In support of this contention are instanced reported cases of the incidence of the disease among the crews of ships in transit, and supposed to be removed from all communication with the land. From this cause it is stated that a British squadron in the year 1782 was completely disabled whilst on service off the French coast. And more recent examples are recorded where the crews of vessels have been attacked in mid seas. But the records of these isolated cases do not furnish undeniable evidence of the aerial source of the infection. On the contrary, in all investigated cases it is considered as probable that the contagion was shipped with the stores, or introduced through the ordinary channels of human intercourse. The latest investigations demonstrate conclusively that the disease, in its invasion from east to west, follows the lines of trade and traffic. From its home in Central Asia the disease, traversing the caravan routes, invades Russia and Turkey. By rail it is conveyed to the busy centres of Eastern and then of esternEurope. By shipitaccompanies the travellerto the northern 9 and southern continents of America. When established in the great centres of commerce it spreads in the adjacent and outlying districts. The epidemic docs not roll as a broad wave from cast to west, but leaps from capital to capital, from town to town, from village to village, whilst the place of its incidence becomes the centre of a broadening area of infection. This mode of invasion has been repeatedly observed, and the uniformity in the plan of attack indicates obedience to certain definite laws. In the manner of its generation, evolution, and decadence, Influenza exhibits many qualities in common with the life history of Asiatic Cholera. Hut there is this point of distinction in the characteristics of the two diseases: sanitary measures arc effective in arresting the progress of Cholera, whilst the course of Influenza is neither diverted nor in any measure affected by the most stringent hygienic precautions. Notification of Infectious Diseases. Under the provisions of the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1974 cases have been reported. Few notifications are made by householders or persons in charge. The Act has alone been rendered effective by the action of medical practitioners. But the dual responsibility prescribed by the Act has doubtless assisted those gentlemen in the performance of their duty. Probably the number notified includes all but a small percentage of the persons affected with the diseases scheduled under the Act. Sometimes cases occur where the symptoms are not prominent, and the infectious character of the attack is unsuspected. Such cases may run a neglected course without recourse to medical advice, and without the adoption of any precautions in regard to isolation and disinfection. If the subject of attack be a child, it may attend school and mix with children at play. If an adult, he may come into contact with others at a place of business, or in the public conveyances. A limited outbreak at Stockwell was traced to the contagion resulting from an unrecognised attack of scarlet fever in a child. The child, 10 whose hands were still peeling when she came under observation, had unhappily been allowed to mix freely with her playmates, and had been the unconscious carrier of infection into several houses. No one was more surprised than the mother, when her attention was called to the obligation which rested upon her of providing the means of isolation, or in default, of allowing her child to be removed to the hospital. She was not aware that the child was suffering from any complaint, nor was she willing to believe that others might be endangered by a disease which had not entailed a days illness on her own child. Probably there arc not many people who are infectious without the fact being apparent to themselves or their friends; but those who belong to that small class, of which the example noticed is a type, arc especially dangerous to their neighbours, and arc doubtless the unconscious and unsuspected source of origin of many outbreaks of disease. Scarlet fever occupies a prominent place among the infectious diseases notified. 1126 cases are attributable to that disease alone. Of these 1069 recovered from the attack; but the illness ran a fatal course in 57 instances. 586 cases, or more than 50 per cent., were placed under treatment in the hospitals of the Asylums Board. The next disease in importance, from the number that suffered from it is Diphtheria. 330 cases are reported. 256 persons recovered, and 74 died. 150 persons were notified as suffering from Typhoid Fever. Of these, 120 recovered and 30 died. Puerperal Fever, a very fatal disease, but happily now of very occasional occurrence, carried off 11 cases of the 13 reported. But Erysipelas, affecting 248 people, caused the death of only 3. 15 cases of Smallpox were reported, but the disease was not well marked in any, and all the persons infected recovered. 46 cases were returned as suffering from Croup, and 41 from Continued Fever. Seven cases of Diarrhoea appear in the returns as Cholera. 11 Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. On the Eighteenth of August in the year of this Report, a measure to consolidate and amend the Acts relating to Artisans' and labourers' Dwellings and the Housing of the Working Classes became Law. The Bill in its passage through Parliament received the assent and support of the London County Council. It gives to that body and the Vestries large powers in dealing with insanitary and dilapidated property. The chief statutes it amends and replaces arc those generally known as Cross's and Torrens' Acts. The former related to the improvement of large areas. It had been applied in Lambeth by the Metropolitan Board of Works resulting in the demolition of some ancient and dilapidated blocks of dwellings situated in the North Marsh Ward and bearing the name of Windmill Row. The latter was the Act of the District Authority. It applied to single houses, small blocks, or limited areas. Neither of the Acts was popular. The compensation clauses were unduly favourable to the interests of the property owner; and the legal processes inseparable from their operation, cumbrous and expensive. The policy of placing a fictitious value on insanitary and sometimes worthless property by awarding large and excessive sums of money in compensation was felt to be economically unsound. A premium was set upon carelessness and neglect. The very condition, to provide against which the Acts had been framed, was encouraged by setting the Acts in motion. Several attempts had been made in Parliament to modify or amend these defects. But little success attended such efforts. The Vestries shrank from an expenditure of public money that unjustly burdened the ratepayers. The Metropolitan Board avoided an outlay inordinately large and unremunerative. The Acts fell into disuse. Royal Commission. As a result of a popular outcry against the alleged apathy of the authorities, the Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes was appointed. It held many sittings. The evidence of Philanthropists, Ministers of Religion, Medical Officers of Health, scientific experts, and the 12 secretaries of charitable organizations, was taken. Adopting the views of the local authorities, the Commission condemned the legislative attempts, already made, to deal with a con lition exciting so much public sentiment, as incomplete and unsatisfactory, and the scale upon which compensation under these Acts was awarded a; unfair in the interests of the ratepayers. Tne Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, may be regarded as the legislative outcome of the Report of that Commission. Divisions of the Act. The Act is divided into seven parts. Part Five and Six relate to its application in Scotland and Ireland. Part Three refers to the establishment or acquisition of lodging-houses and their management by the Council. Part Seven applies to temporary provisions and repeals. Part Four is supplemental. Parts One and Two, the former dealing with large areas and the latter with unhealthy houses and small areas, are important additions to the health legislation of the Metropolis. They correspond respectively in the scope of their application with Cross's and Torrens' Acts, both of which are repealed. The County Council and part first. The County Council in virtue of its newly acquired powers under the Act has already commenced operations. In the Bethnal Green District an extensive area has been scheduled. But for some time at least this achievement is to stand alone. At a Conference of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council with Delegates of the Vestries and Distric Boards, held in the Council Hall, Spring Gardens, it was declared by the Chairman that no further scheme under Part One could at present be entertained. If the announcement may be taken as authoritative, the most important sections of Part One, except in so far as they have application to the proposed improvement of the Bethnal Green area, are likely to remain in abeyance. The County Council calls upon the Vestries through their representatives in Conference assembled, to recognise the responsibilities 13 devolving upon them, having reference to that part of the Act which relates to the duties of the several Vestries. At the same moment the Council, through its Chairman of Committee, intimates that the Council has no intention of applying itself in regard to the obligations imposed upon it by that part of the Act relating to the duties of the County Council. The lesson is one of precept not of example. In relief of the heavy parochial burdens the application of the Act entails. .Mr. Smith, the clerk Mr. Smith's Resolution. to this Vcstrv, carried a resolution that the moietv of the cost of a scheme comprising five or a greater number of houses should be borne by the central authority. This proposal has since been accepted in principle by the Council. Hut the concession docs not srtisfy the measure of assistance the local authorities had a right to expect. The course of disease is not limited by the boundaries of parishes. The rich of the west should share with the poor of the east in the removal of a common danger. An unhealthy area located in any part of the Metropolis constitutes a danger to the whole, and the expenses of its improvement should be defrayed by a charge on a general fund. Part Second. Tart second of the Act is of especial interest and importance to the Vestries and Boards of Works in whose hands is placed the sanitary administration of the Metropolis. Its objects may be described as threefold : i. The closure of houses unfit for human habitation. ii. The removal of obstructive buildings. iii. The improvement of unhealthy areas. I. The Closure of Houses Unfit for Human Habitation. Unhealthy Houses. The considerations involved in carrying into effect the duty imposed on the Vestry by this division of Part ii, of the Act may be examined under four heads. 14 (a) Definition of Conditions which render a House unfit for Human Habitation. When the Delegates of the Vestries and District Boards of Works met in Conference with the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the County Council, an endeavour was made to define the conditions which might he Definitions. regarded by the Medical Officer of Health as constituting a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to render a dwelling-house unfit for human habitation With this object in view, a separate meeting of Medical Officers was convened. The question was fully discussed and a report issued. The Medical Officers found themselves unable to formulate any precise definition. They were prepared, however, to lay down some general principles. The report deals with Insanitary conditions under four headings, the existence of any of which might constitute a ground for action under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. But it was considered that the effect which any insanitary condition might exert on the health of the people exposed to its influence was largely dependent on the degree or extent in which such insanitary condition was found to be existing, and in consequence the determination as to whether a dwelling be fit or unfit for human habitation must be governed having regard to the merits of each particular case. Unhealthy site. A dwelling-house built in a hollow or in a situation not admitting of effective drainage, or exposed to malarious influences, or built in a manner or on a soil which causes or permits the air to be contaminated by injurious gases; or built on a site so surmounted by buildings that the access of sufficient light and air is impossible might properly be the subject of representation under Section 30. 15 Defective construction. Under this head would be classed original defect of plan; tor example, a dwelling-house improperly ventilated or lighted, or with the closet and dustbin so situated as to cause nuisance within the house. Any condition which results in permanent dampness. Such faulty construction of chimney Hues as permits products of combustion from adjoining premises to permanently contaminate the air of living rooms. Age and general want repairs. This when it reaches a degree of dilapidation is obviously a just cause of representation. Nuisances. Bad drainage, faulty closets, and tilth are grounds for action rather under the Nuisances Removal and Sanitary Acts; but where affecting a whole dwelling-house, or when combined with faults of site and construction and general want of repairs, they justify act on also under the Housing of the Working Classes Act (A) The Discovery of a House subject to Conditions which render ir Unfit for Human Habitation. Discovery. Section 32 declares, " It shall be the duty of every Local Authority to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district with a view to ascertain whether any dwelling-house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation." The framers of this section do not make their intention sufficiently clear. The words "inspection ot their district might be regarded as meaning a general survey such as the Sanitary Inspector accomplishes whilst engaged in the performance of his ordinary duties. Or the interpretation may have a wider 16 significance. The section may even contemplate a periodical inspection and examination in detail of the sanitary condition of every house in the Parish. That the latter interpretation is the better one appears probable. By no other means can the Local Authority ascertain when dwelling-houses situated in their district fall into a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. (c) The representation of a dwelling-house subject to conditions which render it unfit for human habitation. Representation. A representation may be made by the Medical Officer of health, acting independently or after the receipt of a written complaint signed by four or more householders. In accordance with section 30, it is the duty of the Medical Officer of health of every district to represent to the Local Authority of that district any dwelling-house which appears to him to be in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. And having regard to section 31, when in any district any four or more householders living in or near to any street complain in writing to the Medical Officer of Health of that district that any dwelling-house in or near that street is in a condition so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, he shall forthwith inspect the same and transmit to the Local Authority the said complaint together with his opinion thereon. But it appears by section 32, that the Local Authority may act on information given by their own officer, or by any person, provided that it appears to the Local Authority that the dwelling-house is in a state injuriors or dangerous to health. (7) The Responsibility and Action of the Vestry in regard to such Representation. 17 Action of Vestry. By virtue of section 32, it is the duty or the Local Authority if it appear to it after representation or information given that a house is in a state injurious or dangerous to health, to forthwith take proceedings against the owner or occupier, for closing the dwelling. On such proceedings the Court may impose a penalty on the owner not exceeding twenty pounds. It may make a closing order. It may also authorize the Local Authority to make a reasonable allowance to every tenant on account of his expenses in removing; the amount of the allowance being a civil debt due to the Local Authority and recoverable from the owner. Where a closing order has been made and not determined by a subsequent order and the Local Authority are of opinion that the dwelling-house has not been rendered fit tor human habitation and the necessary steps have not been taken with due diligence to render it so fit, and that its continuance is dangerous to the health of the public or the inhabitants, it shall pass a resolution that it is expedient to order the demolition of the building. Notice on Owner. Notice of the resolution shall be served on the owner who is at liberty to put in an appearance, state an objection, or undertake forthwith to execute the necessary works within a limited period specified by the Local Authority. Demolition. If the works are not completed in the time or any extended time allowed by the Local Authority, the Local Authority shall order the demolition of the building. Any person aggrieved by an order of the Local Authority may appeal against it; the notice of appeal to be given within one month after notice of the order has been served. 18 II. The Removal of Obstructive Buildings. Obstructive Buildings. In accordance with section 38, if a Medical Officer of Health find that any building within his district, although not in itself unfit for human habitation, is so situate that by reason of its proximity to or contact with any other buildings it causes one of the following effects, that is to say: (а) It stops Ventilation, or otherwise makes or conduces to make such other buildings to be in a condition unfit for human habitation or dangerous or injurious to health, or (b) It prevents proper measures from being carried into effect for remedying any nusiance injurious to health or other evils complained of in respect to such buildings. In any such case the Medical Officer shall represent such obstructive building, stating that in his opinion it is expedient that the building should be pulled down. The Local Authority after considering a report respecting the circumstances of the building, and the cost of pulling down and of acquiring the land, and after hearing any objection stated by the owner, should make an order either allowing the objection or directing that such obstructive building should be pulled down. Such order is subject to appeal. III. The Improvement of Unhealthy Areas. Improvement of Unhealthy Areas Where it appears to the Local Authority that the closeness, narrowness, and bad arrangement or bad condition of any building, or the want of light, air, ventilation or proper conveniences, or any other sanitan defect in any buildings is dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inhabitants either of the said buildings or of the 19 neighbouring buildings, and that the demolition or the reconstruction or rearrangement of the said buildings or of some of them is necessary to remedy the said evils, the Local Authority shall pass a resolution to the above effect, and direct a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of the area. Schemes may also be prepared on resolution of the Local Authority in respect of areas of which unhealthy houses or obstructive buildings under order of demolition form part, and where it appears to the Local Authority that it would be beneficial to the health of the inhabitants of neighbouring dwelling-houses if the area were used for all or any of the following purposes: (a) Dedicated as a highway or open space, or (b) Appropriated, sold or let, for the erection of dwellings for the working classes, or (r) Exchanged with other neighbouring land which is more suitable for the erections of such dwellings and on exchange appropriated, sold or let, for such erection. Notice. After the resolution has been passed by the Local Authority directing a scheme to be prepared for the improvement of an area, notice must be served on the owners, lessees, and occupiers having an interest in the property. Enquiry of Local Government Board. A petition is then presented to the Local Government Board by the Local Authority for an order sanctioning the scheme. The Local Government Board may then hold an enquiry, and if satisfied that the scheme either absolutely or subject to conditions and modifications would be beneficial to the health of the district may by order sanction their scheme either with or without conditions and modifications. 20 Purchase by Agreement. Upon the order being made, the Local Authority may purchase by agreement the area sanctioned in the order. But if the Local Authority fail to arrange an agreement as to the terms of the purchase, the order shall be published by inserting a notice in "The Gazette," and by renewing notice on the owners. Petition Against the Order. Any owner may within two months after publication petition the Local Government Board against the order, and if the petition is presented and is not withdrawn, the order shall be provisional. Confirmation of Order. If the Local Government Board is satisfied that the order has been duly published, and that two months after such publication has expired, and that either a petition has not been presented or if presented has been withdrawn, they shall confirm the order, and from that date such order shall come into operation, and have effect as if it were enacted by this Act. Provision for Accomodation of persons displaced. Provisions for the dwelling accomodation of persons of the working classes displaced by the operation of the scheme shall be made by the Local Government Board in the sanctioning order. Settlement of Compensation. An Arbitrator appointed and removable, by the Local Government Board shall settle the amount of compensation. The estimate of value of the dwelling house shall be based on the fair market value estimated at the time of the valuation, due regard being had to the nature and then condition of the property, and the probable duration of the buildings in their existing slate, and to the state of repair thereof, and without any additional allowance in respect of compulsory purchase. The compensation so far as it is based on rental shall be based on the rental which would have been obtainable if the dwelling 21 house was occupied for legal purposes, and without such overcrowding as is dangerous to health ; and shall, if the house be in an insanitary condition, be estimated as if the house had been put into a sanitary condition, deducting the estimated cost of such outlay, and if the house cannot reasonably be made fit for human habitation, then the compensation shall be estimated at the value of the land and the materials of the building thereon. Customs Act, 1890. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1890, imposes certain new duties upon the Medical Officer of Health. Section 26, the only section having reference to the subject, provides that, "The Assessment to inhabited house duty of any house originally built or adapted by addition or additions, and used for the sole purpose of providing dwellings for persons at rents not exceeding seven shillings and sixpence a week, and occupied only by persons paying such rents, shall be discharged by the said Commissioners, provided that a certificate of the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the house is situate, or other medical practitioner appointed as hereinafter provided shall be produced to them to the effect that the house is so constructed as to afford suitable accomodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting it, and that due provision is made for their Sanitary requirements. The Medical Officer of Health of a district, on request by the person who would be liable to pay the house duty on any house in the district, if the duty were not discharged as aforesaid, shall examine the house for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a certificate can properly be given and if the house be constructed so as to afford such accomodation and due provision is made as aforesaid shall certify the same accordingly, provided that the authority, if they arc of opinion that the duties that would devolve upon the Medical Officer of Health under this section could not be performed by him without interference with the due performance of his ordinary duties, may appoint some other legally qualified 22 medical practitioner having the qualifications required for office of Medical Officer of Health of the district to make such examinations and give such certificates as aforesaid." The Medical Officer is here called upon to step outside the ordinary course of his duty in order that he may decide whether or no certain owners of property shall be exempted from Assessment in regard to dwellings comprised in the description provided for by this section. The separate dwellings in respect to which certificates were granted during the year numbered 295. Sanitary Department. Progress has been made in the sanitary work of Parish and considerable improvement effected. Your staff of Inspectors has performed the complex duties devolving upon it with energy and efficiency. The cases coming daily under notice, although numerous, have received early attention, and especially in that section of them having reference to infectious diseases has promptitude been displayed. Nineteen hundred and seventy-four cases of infectious dieases have been notified at the office during the year. Except in a limited number of instances an inspection has been made and disinfectants supplied on the day of the receipt of notification. In all cases the drain test has been applied. A large percentage of the drains thus examined proved defective; some flaw in the system permitting the escape of sewer gas into the interior of the house. The older system of drain laying was necessarily imperfect. Experience had not yet suggested improvements in principle and method, now universally recognised as essential to the satisfaction of sanitary requirement. But in the demand for the introduction of these improvements the Sanitary Inspecto'r is often met by serious difficulty. Some landlords averse to the large expenditure a reconstruction entails, whilst observing the letter of the law, employ every artifice in the defeat of its spirit and intention. These evasions, in which an experienced hand 23 may indulge, and that successfully, for a time, are numerous. The delays which the law permits are tiresome. Twenty or thirty visits, including attendances at the police court, appointments made, broken, and re-made with the landlord, his solicitor, agent, or work-people, have sometimes been found necessary before a case of drainage work could be carried through. Such extreme cases are fortunately exceptional and happily decreasing in number. Hut every day disputes arise owing to conflicting interests of landlord and tenant, joint occupiers and separate owners of adjoining properties which sorely tax the time at the disposal of the Sanitan Inspector. In the settlement of these disputes and in bringing the parties together, and often without recourse to legal preceedings, the intervention of your Chief Sanitary Inspector has been of the highest service. Overtime These contentions between the Vestry and landlord and between divers interests, constitute obstacles and hindrances in the course of the performance of the Inspector's duties which must be taken into account when considering the requirements of each district of the Parish, and the increasing amount of work imposed on the Sanitary Inspector by successive Acts of Parliament. In meeting the enlarged demands made upon them, your Chief Inspector, your District Inspectors, and your Sanitary Clerk have cheerfully devoted much time after official hours, which should properly belong to them as time of recreation, in the service of the Vestry. It is only a matter of simple justice to give this recognition of services without which the routine work of the office could not have been efficiently performed. In view of the enlarged and additional powers conferred on your Vestry by the operation in January next of the Public Health Act, 1891, it will be necessary for your Vestry to consider the question of enlarging your sanitary staff. This subject, however, will come before you in the ordinary course and in the Reports of your Sanitary Committee. 24 A table in detail of the Sanitary works accomplished during the year is appended. As it has been found necessary to re-arrange some of the items under separate headings, the total result appears in excess of that which it would have been had the old order been observed. Consequently, this table is not on the same basis, and cannot be used for purposes of comparison between the results of this and former years. THE BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered in Lambeth during the year 1890, reach a total of 9017 cases, in less than the number registered in the previous year. The registered number of male children exceeds by 215 that of the female. During the same period in the entire Metropolitan area 130,690 births are recorded. The table shows the number of births registered in each year for the last ten years:— Year. No. of Births. Year. No. of Births. 1890 9017 1885 9143 1889 8906 1884 9517 1888 9017 1883 9209 1887 9110 1882 9250 1886 9047 1881 8945 The birth rate for Lambeth, calculated for the year 1890 is 33.0 per 1000 inhabitants. The Metropolitan rate for the same period is 29.1 per 1000, the lowest rate on record in London; in 1879 it was 35.5 per 1000, and since then there has been a continued decline year by year. 25 c The number of Births in each District, and a comparison of number of Births registered in each Quarter.

The number of marriages celebrated in Lambeth show an increase upon last year of 63. Like the birth rate, the marriage rate has previously fallen year by year, and the number of marriages is diminishing, notwithstanding the increase of the population. The marriages registered this year are fewer in number than in any annual return made during the last decade, except the last two years. Number of marriages in the metropolis, 36,753. Year.

The deaths from all causes, registered in Lambeth during the year 1890 were 5942, of these 2996 were males, and 2946 females. This number includes the deaths of 470 persons who ha I been removed to the Hospitals situate in Lambeth, but who previously lived in Other parishes of the Metropolis; on the other hand, 306 parishioners died in the ou;l)ing institutions in the Metropolis and 64 parishioners died in extra Metropolitan institutions. Having deducted the former and added the latter, the number of deaths proper to Lambeth is 5842, representing a death rate of 21.3 per 1000 persons living. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 21.8 per 1000. In the Metropolis the registered deaths numbered 91,243, and the rate was higher than any one of the five preceding years. The death rate in the five great groups of districts is as follows:— South Districts 18.8 West Districts 18.2 Central Disiricts 30.7 North Districts 18.1 East Districts 23.8 28 The following table shows the mortality, male and female, in the different districts, and a comparison of the deaths in each quarter.

The mortality from the principal Zymotic diseases includes 659 parishioners and 73 strangers, being an increase of 27 upon last year's figures. Deducting the number of the strangers and adding the number of the deaths of parishioners who died in the outlying institutions, the total number of Zymotic deaths proper to Lambeth is 692. This represents a Zymotic death rale of 2 4 per 1000, the Metropolitan rate for the same period being 222 per 1000. In the following table the Zymotic death rate is compared in the different districts of the Parish, both for the whole year and each quarter of the year, strangers deducted. March Jure Sept. Dec.
