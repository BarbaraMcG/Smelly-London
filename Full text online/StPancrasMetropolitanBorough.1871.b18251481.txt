STPAN 28 S T. PANCRAS, MIDDLESEX SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being the Report for the 1871. To the Vestrymen of St. Pancras. Gentlemen, When the census was taken on April 2nd, 1871, the population enumerated in this parish was 221,594. The annual increase of population between 1861 and 1871 had been 1.1 per cent.; hence the average population of St. Pancras for the year under notice was 222,200, and these figures form the basis of the calculations in this report. In the 52 weeks ending on December 30th, 1871, 7588 births were registered in the parish. From these figures a deduction must be made of 49 children, born of pauper non-parishioners in the Strand Union Workhouse. The corrected number of births is thus, 7489, or 7510 for the year of 365 days. The number of registered deaths during the year of 365 days was 5458. Deducting 124 deaths in the Strand Union Workhouse, and 57 deaths of non-parishioners in the Highgate Infirmary, adding 263 deaths of parishioners in the Hampstead Small Pox Hospital, 40 in the Highgate Small Pox Hospital, 9 in the Islington Workhouse Hospital, and 9 in the London Fever Hospital; the actual mortahty of parishioners becomes 5598 in the year of 365 days. The natural increase of the population was hence 1912. The natural increase in 1867 was 2724. „ „ 1868 2915. „ „ 1869 2594. „ „ 1870 2301. „ „ 1871 1912. If we go further back, this progressive diminution in the natural rate of 2 increase of the population is still more striking. In 1861 the gross increase was 29 per cent. greater than in 1871, notwithstanding an increase of 11.5 per cent. in the population during the decade. These facts have a very important bearing upon statistics relating to the mortality of the parish. Their exact significance cannot however be estimated until more details respecting the census of 1871 are accessible. The birth-rate was 38.81 per 1000 persons living; in 1870 it was 34.61 per 1000. The births were fewer by 105 than in the year 1870. The deaths exceeded by 284 those of the preceding year. The annual rate of mortality was 25.19 per 1000 persons living. In 1871, the death-rate was 25.19 per 1000. ,, 1870, ,, ,, 24.15 ,, „ 1869, „ „ 22.81 ,, „ 1868, „ „ 22.50 ,, „ 1867, „ „ 24.25 ,, ,, 1866, „ „ 24.45 „ „ 1865, „ „ 24.80 ,, „ 1864, „ „ 26.03 ,, „ 1863, „ „ 23.28 ,, „ 1862, „ „ 21.80 ,, „ 1861, „ „ 23.00 ,, The average annual rate of mortality of the 11 years 1861-1871, was 23.66 per 1000 persons living. The death-rate in 1871 hence exceeded that of the 11 years 1861.1871 by 1.53, and that of the year 1870 by 1.04. it was. with the exception of that of 1864, the highest rate of mortality during the past 11 years. In the metropolis, as a whole, the annual rate of mortality in 1871 was 24.7 per 1000; in the North District, of which this parish forms a part, the rate was 25.6 per 1000. The death-rate in St. Pancras was thus 0.49 per 1000 above the metropolitan average. It was 0.9 per 1000 below that of the North District; but in this estimation of the mortality of the North District it must not be forgotten that all deaths in the Small Pox Hospitals at Highgate and Hampstead are included. MORTALITY IN THE SEVERAL SUB-DISTRICTS AND IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. In the sub-districts of Regent's Park, Tottenham Court, and Kentish Town the deaths were fewer, in the Camden Town sub-district they were nearly the same, and in the sub-districts of Gray's Inn Road and Somers Town respectively, the deaths were considerably in excess of those in 1870. If, however, the deaths of parishioners in extra-parochial hospitals were added, the mortality would be seen to have been larger in every sub-district in 1871, than in the preceding year. Distributing the deaths in the workhouse, and the deaths in hospitals over the sub-districts in proportion to their respective populations, we find the annual rate of mortality to have been, in 1871 : in the whole parish, 25.19; Regent's Park, 25.0; Tottenham Court, 24.6 ; Gray's Inn Road, 25.9; Somers Town, 27.4; Camden Town, 25.6; and Kentish Town, 24.0. 3 The deaths in public institutions were as follows:— In 1871. In 1870. St. Pancras Workhouse 868 427 Strand Union Workhouse 124 111 Highgate Infirmary 182 99 University College Hospital . 207 222 Royal Free Hospital 131 117 MORTALITY AT VARIOUS AGES. For the year of 52 weeks, the deaths were:— In 1871. In 1870. At ages under 1 year 1295 1181 „ 0—5 years 2154 2166 „ 5—60 „ 2093 2019 ,, above 60 „ 1183 1235 exclusive of deaths in extra parochial hospitals, chiefly among those between 5 and 20 years of age. It is thus seen that there was an unusually high mortality among adults during the vigorous period of life. The deaths of children under one year of age formed 17.2 per cent. of the registered births. MORTALITY FROM VARIOUS DISEASES. The annual rates of mortality from the undermentioned diseases in the year under notice were, in London and St. Pancras respectively:— London. St. Pancras. Small Pox (deaths in the hospitals included) 2.41 3.42 Diarrhoea and Cholera 1.27 1.06 Continued Fevers (deaths in the London Fever Hospital included) 0.54 0.50 Scarlet Fever 0.58 0.48 Diphtheria 0.10 0.17 Hooping Cough 0'70 0.71 Measles 0.44 0.47 Phthisis, Tabes, Atrophy, and Scrofulous Diseases 4.64 4.48 Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and Asthma . 8.88 4.06 The deaths from the 7 principal zymotic diseases, viz., Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Hooping Cough, continued Fever, and Bowel Fluxes, formed 26.1 per cent. of the total mortality: deaths in hospitals included. In the metropolis, as a whole, the corresponding per centage was 24.7. The prevalent diseases causing large mortality were Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, and Measles. SMALL POX. The year 1871 will long be memorable in the annals of St. Pancras, as the year in which the parish was visited by a more terrible outbreak of Small Pox than in any year since the passing of the Metropolis Local 4 Management Act, 1855 ; an outbreak long foreseen, and again and again predicted by me, yet which at length came upon people very much unprotected by vaccination, and too little shielded by any organization adequate to meet the disease. At the beginning of the year under notice, Small Pox, though it had not as yet assumed formidable dimensions, was rapidly increasing, and on January 16th I called a Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee, reported the sad increase of the disease, and pointed out the necessity for taking prompt, energetic, and efficient means for staying the epidemic. Yet the most important of these measures, the provision of a temporary hospital, was not then adopted. From that time the disease spread rapidly; the number of fresh cases reported increasing week by week, till from 15 reported cases during the first week in January the number had swelled to 186 cases during the week ending 27th May. This was the maximum ; but it wa6 not till nearly the end of June that any large decrease occurred. From this time Small Pox rapidly declined till a minimum of three cases was reported during the week ending October 21st. An increase then occurred, and during the closing week of the year 23 new cases were reported. This last figure has been about maintained since the close of the year 1871. Shortly before the time when the disease had fairly begun to decline, all difficulties as to the erection of an hospital had been overcome, and it was opened on June 5th. And a very useful institution it proved, though never filled. In it 67 cases received the skilful treatment of Thos. Harley, Esq. Of these cases 8 died, and 59 recovered. Had this building been erected earlier, no doubt it would have been filled to overflowing, and would have exerted a decided influence in arresting the epidemic; but as the patients numbered only 2.4 per cent. of all the cases reported to this department, the good achieved was less perceptible. The building was kept open till it seemed to be no longer required. 2799 cases of Small Pox were reported to me; but doubtless this number falls very far short of the number that actually occurred. The disease was of very unequal prevalence in various parts of the parish, now attacking one part, now another, of the parish. No. 1 Ward suffered first and very severely; whilst No. 6, or Somers Town Ward, though escaping longest, received the final brunt of the attack, and suffered most. Having kept records of all known cases till the end of July (when the epidemic had already considerably declined), I find that there had occurred up to that time in— No. 1 Ward 294 cases. ,, 2 ,, 108 „ ,, 8 ,, 142 ,, ,, 4 ,, 59 ,, ,, 5 ,, 253 ,, „ 6 „ 678 ,, ,, 7,, 188 ,, ,, 8„428,, The ratios of these numbers would not be materially altered were the tabulation continued till the end of the year, except that No. 1 Ward would exhibit a larger proportion of cases. 5 Of the 2799 cases, 1356, or 48.4 per cent., were sent into the Hampstead Hospital, and 67, or 2.4 per cent. into our own hospital; whilst 1376 cases, or 49.2 per cent. were not known to be sent into hospital. I have not obtained any statistical information from the Highgate Small Pox Hospital. With regard to the courteous, but firm refusal of the Resident Medical Officer of that Institution to allow me even to inspect the books of the hospital, I will merely express a hope that the 61st clause of the Public Health Bill, now before parliament, may speedily become law, and that it shall become obligatory on the officers of any such institution to furnish Medical Officers of Health with all reasonable and needful assistance in the preparation of returns as to sickness. Unfortunately also I can obtain no records from the Poor Law Officers of this parish as to the number of pauper cases treated in the above hospital, with the results. Of the 2799 cases, 711, or 25.4 per cent. died, besides 40 deaths in the Highgate Hospital. The rate of mortality is best obtained, however, from the rate of mortality in the Hampstead Hospital, where it was 19.4 per cent. among patients from this parish. The epidemic was not only unusually severe, but uncommonly fatal, large numbers of the cases being of a malignant and hæmorrhagic type ; and hæmorrhagic cases are almost invariably fatal. No single case of this form was admitted into the Temporary Hospital. As regards the scientific history of the disease, the epidemic illustrates the well-known fact that contagion was the perhaps exclusive agent in the spread of the disease. Into all the reasons which have induced me to arrive at the conclusion that personal contact with an infected person, the act of coming within a very short distance of such a person, or contact with infected articles, are the sole efficient means of spreading Small Pox, it is unnecessary that I should enter. Of course unprotectedness by proper vaccination, or in the case of adults, by re-vaccination after reaching adult life, is presupposed. Two agents have, however, been alleged to be active in propogating Small Pox in St. Pancras during the past year; and yet I believe that these supposed agents have had nothing whatever to do with spreading the disease. These were the Fleet Sewer, running from the Hampstead Hospital through this parish from N.W. to S.E., which receives the sewage of that institution; and the wind blowing from the hospital over this parish. It will be necessary for me to say a few words as to these. First, as regards the influence of the Fleet Sewer. My attention was drawn to this at an early period of the year, and I have kept a careful watch upon cases of Small Pox occurring in the neighbourhood of this sewer. I have nevertheless been quite unable to trace any greater number of cases of the disease, as occurring over or about the sewer than in any other part of St. Pancras. The sewer had, I am convinced, no appreciable influence in spreading Small Pox. Next, as regards the wind, it has been alleged by a respected medical member of the Sanitary Committee and of the Guardians' Board, that it had been noticed that when the wind had blown for some time from the west, i.e. blowing from the Hampstead Hospital over this parish, an increase of Small Pox among us followed, attributable to a something derived from the hospital. Now it is generally accepted amongst the 6 medical profession that an easterly wind tends to propagate Small Pox. I regret, therefore, that my attention was not directed to the above assertion till the end of September, when its verification or refutation became more difficult. By comparing the cases reported day by day, and the deaths recorded, with the prevalent winds, as shown by published meteorological tables, I have tested the above statement in every way that I could devise, and I am compelled to adopt the conclusion that a prevalent westerly wind was not, as a rule, followed in due course by an increase of Small Pox. Before I leave this topic I may quote a report of my own, presented to the Sanitary Committee on September 20th last, which puts the matter in a clear light. I said: "I have been unable to trace any connexion "between the existence of Small Pox in Kentish Town and the Hampstead "Hospital, or the Fleet Sewer leading therefrom. * * * The district "was thoroughly infected with the disease long before the hospital was "opened for the reception of Small Pox patients, and as the number of "patients in the hospital increased, Small Pox decreased in Kentish Town "subsequently increasing as the number of patients in the hospital decreased." Bight up to the confines of Hampstead Parish, Kentish Town was steeped in Small Pox, and the thoroughfare leading from the hospital to this parish was affected before ever a Small Pox patient was admitted into Hampstead Hospital. The 26th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, amended by the 2nd section of the Sanitary Act, 1870, was found to be too cumbersome and imperfect to secure the removal of patients into hospital, and it was enforced only in one case. I have hopes that these sections may be amended in the Public Health Bill, 1872, before it becomes law and the amendments made applicable to the metropolis. The Disinfecting Chamber erected near the Hospital has proved a great boon to the parish. VACCINATION AND RE-VACCINATION. Up to Michaelmas, 1870, vaccination had been scandalously neglected in this parish, and I can testify from personal inspection of so-called vaccinated persons, that many persons reputed to be vaccinated had had the operation performed in a most imperfect manner, and that no real protection, or only the slightest degree of protection, had been conferred. Unvaccinated children, many of whom had reached several years of age, abounded everywhere. The Small Pox epidemic, the greater stringency of the New Vaccination Act, and the more vigorous action of the Poor Law Officers have given a great stimulus to vaccination, and during the year ending Michaelmas, 1871, there were successfully vaccinated by the public vaccinators, 2537 children under one year of age, and 1987 above one year of age ; total, 4524, as compared with 2608 during the preceding year. During the same period the registered number of births was 7531. I am sorry to have to state that notwithstanding this large increase of public vaccination, your officers find from time to time many children who are unvaccinated. I am unable to state what proportion of persons attacked by Small Pox had been properly vaccinated. Enquiries were duly made by the inspectors, but I have been convinced that the statements made to them by relatives 7 as to vaccination are totally unreliable. The statistics of the various Small Pox hospitals are conclusive as to the great efficacy of vaccination in warding off Small Pox, and where complete immunity has not been conferred, in mitigating the severity of this loathsome disease. I am not yet in a position to pronounce an opinion as to the working of the new arrangements for public vaccination, no sufficient opportunity having been afforded of watching their working under varied circumstances. 9764 persons were successfully re-vaccinated by the public vaccinators. That no indubitable severe case of Small Pox after re-vaccination has become known to me during the year, speaks volumes for this operation; all the supposed cases of Small Pox after re-vaccination turning out to have been re-vaccinated after Small Pox had affected the system. I must except one doubtful and fatal case, where a man died from incautious exposure to inclement weather whilst suffering from mild Small Pox, stated to be after re-vaccination. WATER SUPPLY. The parish is supplied by the West Middlesex and the New River Companies with water of fair quality. The former Company derives its supply from the Thames ; the latter from the River Lea, from Chadwell Spring, and from chalk wells at Hoddesden, Cheshunt, and Amwell, the river supply and the well supply being furnished in about equal amounts. The water supplied by each Company was invariably, when examined, clear and free from turbidity. Living organisms were never visible in the water drawn from the mains. The water in cisterns, and more especially in butts, is too often contaminated and impure. This, however, arises from no fault of the water as delivered to consumers. During the past session of parliament an Act was passed (Metropolis Water Act, 1871) for securing a constant supply of wholesome water to the metropolis. The superintendence of the filtration and delivery of wholesome water by the London Companies is entrusted to the Board of Trade, who have appointed a water examiner for that purpose. The local authority for the administration of the Act is the Metropolitan Board of Works, and not the Vestry. The various companies have in pursuance of the provisions of the Act, issued regulations for the constant supply of water for domestic purposes. These regulations will, I beheve, meet with the energetic opposition of the Metropolitan Board on behalf of the ratepayers, a majority of whom have hitherto been clamorous for a constant water supply. It remains to be seen how far the public will like the interference and expense which the constant supply threatens. It was generally supposed that a constant supply meant a constant supply laid on at all times from the main to the tap. The companies, however, interpret the Act differently. According to them a constant supply means a supply laid on at all times to the cisterns; but a branch pipe to convey water directly from the pipes of the company (i.e. without the intervention of a cistern) for the special purpose of drinking and cooking, may be laid on from a " screw-down" stop valve inserted in the communication pipe for the conveyance of water supplied by the company, at its point of entrance into the premises. 8 All the fittings at present in use in the metropolis must to a great extent be repaired, renovated, and placed in situations where they will be readily accessible to the Companies' Inspectors. New and stronger pipes, of lead, must be put in, and the pipes, fittings, and even the plumber to put in the fittings, must have the Companies' approval. No overflow or waste pipe, other than a " warning pipe " will be permitted, and all water closets are to have proper waste preventing apparatus. In a sanitary point of view many of the provisions of the proposed regulations are excellent. All butts are to be abolished, and proper cisterns, maintained watertight, properly covered, and placed in such positions that they may be conveniently inspected and cleansed, are to be substituted. No pipe is to be laid through, in, or into any drain, ashpit, sink, manure-hole, or other place where the water is liable to become fouled. No cistern buried or excavated in the ground is to be used for the storage or reception of water without a written permission of the Water Company, a permission which, I hope, will, in the interests of the public health, rarely be granted. The supply pipe for water to a water closet is not to communicate with any apparatus connected with the closet, except the cistern. In certain cases where houses in the occupation of weekly tenants are of such limited accommodation as not, in the opinion of the Medical Officer, to admit of the erection in connexion with them of any proper receptacle for water without risk to health, cisterns may be dispensed with, and a group of houses be supplied from an outside standpipe. An excellent provision is that every supply pipe shall in every situation be properly protected from frost. The penalties for defective fittings and violation of the regulations are sharp,—a £5 fine, and liability to have the water cut off. In this latter event the Company must report the fact to the Vestry, whose duty it will be to take proceedings against the owner or occupier of the premises. A house without water, it is expressly enacted, is prima facie a nuisance and unfit for human habitation, and is to be closed accordingly. Should the Vestry make default in doing its duty, the Chief Officer of Police may, under the direction of a Secretary of State, institute proceedings under the Sanitary Act, 1866. Some such summary powers are necessary with a constant water supply, not only for the prevention of waste, but also to guard against the injury to house property by the overflow of cisterns and the bursting of defective pipes. I trust that a good code of regulations may receive the sanction of of the Board of Trade, and that they will be enforced with forbearance at the outset. Doubtless in a short time, when all is brought into harmonious action, the results will be most beneficial, especially to the poorer classes of the parishioners. SLAUGHTEE-HOUSES. These appear to have been on the whole well kept, and but few complaints have been made of them. There are 87 licensed slaughter-houses in the parish. Throughout the metropolis, butchers and others are now agitating for a repeal of the clause (s. 55) of the Metropolitan Building Act, 1844, which will, in August, 1874, render it illegal to have any private licensed slaughter 9 houses within the metropolitan district. Now the entire removal of all the private slaughter-houses will undoubtedly be attended with many inconveniences, and these can only be met by the establishment of public abattoirs within easy distance of one another, in addition to the central abattoirs at present provided at the Metropolitan Market and elsewhere. Failing this, a wise course would be a more stringent application of the powers under which slaughter-houses are now licensed. At present all new slaughter-houses are required to be 40 feet from a public way, and 50 feet from a dwelling house; but old established slaughter-houses need not be at any specified distance from either a public way or dwelling-house. All slaughterhouses should in any future legislation be required to be at the above distances from public ways and dwelling-houses respectively. They should be properly constructed, well ventilated, well supplied with water, properly drained, the walls lined with glazed tiles, slate, or zinc, and they should have an impermeable floor of asphalt. Such a slaughter-house would be a great convenience to a district, and entail little more nuisance than a butcher's shop. It is asserted that the construction of such places, and especially the doing away with the present, in many instances, unsuitable slaughter-houses, would be a virtual confiscation of the property of the occupiers of existing slaughter-houses. I venture to demur to this argument. All the present slaughter-houses are licensed on this express agreement, defined by the Act —that they are to cease to exist as slaughter-houses after August, 1874. This provision of the Act has of course been taken into consideration by anyone either purchasing or renting a slaughter-house since the year 1844. Property too has been bought and rented in the proximity of existing slaughter-houses on the understanding that these are to be abolished two years hence. To allow the present slaughter-houses to continue under existing restrictions, would be to put money into the slaughterman's pocket at the expense and loss of comfort of his neighbours. I recommend that the Vestry watch any proposed future legislation on this point, and, whilst having due regard to the interests of the slaughtermen, not to forget the interests and comfort of the ratepayers at large. Since the above was written, I learn that Dr. Brewer has introduced a Bill into the Common's house, which, judging from published reports (the Bill is not yet printed), simply does away with the existing clause of the old Act as to the establishment of new slaughter-houses, without providing adequate security against nuisance to the public at large. COW-SHEDS. The cow-sheds in the parish were, at the beginning of the year, under the consideration of a Special Committee, a deputation of cowkeepers having waited upon the Vestry and sought your sanction to a reduction in the minimum of space demanded for each animal. Attention had shortly before been drawn to the cubic space required by my having pointed out the repeated infringements of his license by a particular cowkeeper. I felt it my duty to oppose a diminution of the minimum space on the ground not only of sanitary requirements, but also because only 70 per cent. of the licensed stalls were filled, and in only 23½ per cent. of the sheds were the 10 licensed number of cows kept. The Vestry, however, on the recommendation of the Special Committee resolved to demand only 700 cubic feet; and in my recommendations to the Vestry I have strictly adhered to this resolution. The Justices, nevertheless, refused to accede to the Vestry's request, and maintained the standard at 1,000 cubic feet. I regret that several cowkeepers subsequently infringed their licenses in regard to the number of animals kept, and that the Magistrates felt compelled at the October Sessions to reduce the number of cows permitted to be kept by most of the offending cowkeepers. Subsequently it was ascertained that cows were kept in a shed, the license for which had been allowed to lapse, though the inspector had told the occupier that the licence must be renewed if cows were to be kept. The Sanitary Committee very properly insisted upon the cows being removed, and this was eventually done without any legal proceedings being taken. As this was a shed in which the licensed number of cows had for long been habitually exceeded, its abolition as a cowshed can be no matter of regret. Every endeavour is made by your officers to carry out your amended regulations, 700, and not 1000 cubic feet of space being always demanded for each cow. SANITARY WORKS. Tables are appended, kindly furnished, the one by Mr, Worrell, Chief Clerk in the Department of Works, the other by Mr. Leach, assisted by the Inspectors, giving details as to the amount of sewer work, nuisances abated, unsound food, &c., seized during the past year. GAS. The average illuminating power of the Gas supplied to the parish by the Imperial Company was 14.54 standard sperm candles as tested at the office, 10, Edward Street, in the manner prescribed by the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860. The maximum illuminating power observed was 16.0, and the minimum, 18.8 candles. Of impurities, ammonia was present on every occasion of examination except two, though it was never present in excessive amounts and sulphuretted hydrogen was invariably absent. Sulphur in various forms varied from 11.45 to 29.20 grains per 100 cubic feet, the average being 20.41 grains. The Gas supplied by the Imperial Company to this parish is of a fair average quality. I have investigated some complaints of alleged insufficiency of pressure, but have not found them established on investigation. (Signed), THOS. STEVENSON. May 1st, 1872.
