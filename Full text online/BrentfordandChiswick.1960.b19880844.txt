Scutchings BOROUGH OF BRENTFORD AND CHISWICK Public Health Department, Town Hall Chiswick, W. 4 To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Brentford and Chiswick, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the 33rd Annual Report on the health of the people of Brentford and Chiswick, An analysis of the vital statistics for 1960 shows that this was a very good year in respect of the health of the citizens of the Borough. There was a fall in the death rate and a rise in the birth rate. The infant mortality rate was the lowest yet recorded in the Borough and there was a fall in the notifications of tuberculosis combined with the figure of only one death from tuberculosis in the year. Notifications of cases of infectious disease were reduced in number and there were no cases of poliomyelitis or diphtheria. Some figures however were not so satisfactory. There was still a heavy incidence of deaths from circulatory diseases and cancer. There was a rise in the deaths from accidents and there was a rise in the number of premature births. A small outbreak of Sonne' dysentery principally in school children had to be dealt with and the opportunity was taken to ask for minor improvements in the sanitary provisions in some of the older schools, Provision of amenities and better social conditions for elderly people living alone were increased during the year. Middlesex County Council made provision for an increase in the chiropody service for old people. The Mealson-Wheels Service was augmented by the provision of a second van for transporting these meals. The first Smoke Control Area comprising 300 acres in the south-eastern part of the Borough became operative on 1st May I960, and so the first steps in the provision of a clean atmosphere for the Borough were taken, A considerable amount of progress was made with the Slum Clearance programme started in 1955. This programme can only proceed as fast as new building or conversion of large houses into smaller flats can keep pace with the need for rehousing of the people rendered homeless if their dwellings are demolished. To maintain a state of good health in a population, constant vigilance is required. It can be seen from the "Table of Inspections" that the number of visits rose considerably during the year. The good work done by the many voluntary associations contributes in no small part to the physical and mental well being of the people and I am grateful to all who have submitted information of their work for inclusion in this Report and also to the officials of the Statutory Bodies who have also supplied information. May I also thank the Chairman and the Members of the Public Health Committee for their support during the year and also the Chief Public Health Inspector, -7- the Chief Clerk and all the staff of the Public Health Department for their work and for their assistance in the preparation of this Report. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Managed a. glass Medical Officer of Health Acknowledgements to:- P.R.J. Arnold, Esq., Dr. G.Z. Brett, Dr. R. Heller, Dr. A.

The proportion of open space to the total area of the Borough is approximately 25% a very reasonable proportion for an urban area The residents of the Borough are of mixed categories including professional and clerical people of all grades, artisans factory workers etc, and the types of dwellings vary from flatted houses and cottages to large detached residences in their own surrounding grounds. The amount of slum property is not considerable and progress is now being made with the demolition of houses which are no longer fit for human habitation. The rehousing of the tenants in council houses, details concerning assessment of slum dwellings demolition and the building of new houses are supplied later in this Report, Overcrowding of dwelling houses still remains a problem in the Borough, The number of cases of statutory overcrowding known to the Public Health Department at the end of the year increased slightly even though there was a decrease in the number of new cases found during the year and an increase in the number of cases relieved during the year. The rehousing of overcrowded families although increased was not sufficient to keep up with the rate new cases were found. The total number of new houses completed for occupation by the Borough Council and by private builders was lower in 1960 and New Town housing becomes more difficult to obtain for those who are willing to take advantage of the Council1 s assistance towards this method of rehousing -9- The unemployment figures for adult persons i.e. aged 18 and over in the Borough at the end of 1959, reflected the national general increase in the number of jobs available due to greater industrial activity. On the 12th December, I960, there were 181 unemployed altogether, of which 147 were men and 34 women. This compares with 180 men and 55 women unemployed at the end of 1959, and 223 men and 58 women unemployed at the end of 1958. On 7th December, 1960, the number of jobs vacant totalled 423, (347 at the same date in 1959) of which 174 were for men and 249 for women, i.e. there were more than twice the number of vacancies than there were unemployed persons seeking vacancies. The unemployment figures at the end of 1960 of young persons under 18 years of age were as follows:- Boys Girls Total Number of young persons (other than school leavers) registered as unemployed on 31.12.60. 4 2 6 Boys and Girls who left school at Christmas to enter employment 56 51 107 Totals 60 53 113 Vacancies outstanding at 31.12.60. 109 159 268 During the year competition from boys for indentured apprenticeships in the engineering, printing and woodworking trades continued to be keen and there were insufficient vacancies to meet the demand, although the boys living in this area did fairly well in gaining apprenticeship training in engineering in the London area generally. Articled clerkships (no premium payable) were available for most boys who were interested in the professions, and a number of openings to train in accountancy remained unfilled. So far as girls were concerned, they were bewildered by the large choice of openings. In spite of the number of boys and girls who left school during the period under review the requirements of local employers for young workers could not be met in full. A record was created on the 11th April, 1960 when no young persons were registered at the two bureaux as unemployed Parks and Open Spaces controlled by the Council Area in Acres Boston Manor Park and Island 40.7 Carville Hall Park South 5.8 Carville Hall Park North 10.3 St. Paul' s Recreation Ground 4 3 The Ham Recreation Ground 1.3 Chiswick Common South 8.7 Chiswick House 65.9 Stamford Brook Common 2.5 Home fields Recreation Ground 8.7 Strand Open Space 2.5 Turnham Green Common 7.5 Duke's Meadow Sports Ground 25.7 Embankment Promenade 12.5 Future Embankment Promenade 15.3 Chiswick Open Air Pools Site 1.2 10.4 acres of the above open space land is used as allotments. -10- Facilities for recreation provided by the Borough Council and maintained are as follows:- 14 Football Pitches 7 Rugby Pitches 7 Hockey Pitches 2 Bowling Greens 2 Putting Greens 29 Tennis Courts 12 Cricket Pitches 10 Children's Playgrounds 6 Jumping Pits 4 Running Tracks (grass) In addition, the Borough Council shares with Ealing and Acton, forming with them a joint committee known as the Gunners bury Park Joint Committee, further facilities situated as follows:- 39 Football Pitches 2 Rugby Pitches 2 Hockey Pitches 2 Bowling Greens 2 Putting Greens 16 Tennis Courts 11 Cricket Pitches 1 Children s Playground 2 Golf Courses 1 Boating Lake 1 Fishing Lake Swimming Baths and Paddling Pools controlled by the Council Brentford Indoor Swimming Baths Area 2,430 sq. ft. Capacity 12,049 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1960 69,118 Average number per day 230 Maximum number using baths on one day 430 Chiswick Open Air Swimming Pools:- Large Pool Area 7,500 sq. ft. Capacity 33,750 c. ft. Small Pool Area 3,500 sq. ft. Capacity 18,375 c. ft. Total number of persons using baths in 1960 87,751 Average number per day 573 Maximum number using baths on one day 4,008 The source of the water in the swimming baths is the mains supply of the Metropolitan Water Board. In both the indoor bath and the outdoor pools the water goes through a continuous filtration process, the rate of change-over being about once every three hours in the indoor bath and about once every ten hours in the open air pools, though this latter rate is speeded up during periods of heavy use of the pools. Topping up to allow for loss by evaporation or removal is done several times weekly Additional purification is carried out by means of intermittent chlorination the amount of free chloride aimed at being 0.6 parts per million. Water samples are taken two to three times daily throughout the season for the purposes of chemical analysis and pH estimation. Samples taken from Chiswick Pools for bacteriological examination gave an unsatisfactory result in June and following on this the pools were emptied completely and freshly filled - then it was arranged that filtration should be continuous throughout the day and night to ensure thorough cleansing and subsequently all bacteriological results were excellent except for one occasion in August when a slight amount of pollution was recorded but this was rapidly cleared without need for massive cleansing operations. -11- Attendances at the open air pools were almost down to half those of 1959, the weather was poor throughout the summer months, but there was a satisfactory increase in the use of the indoor baths at Brentford. Paddling Pools - Duke's Meadows - Area (2 pools each 60' x 60') 7,200 sq. ft. Depth 6" to 1 in middle These paddling pools are filled daily from the mains supply and 1½ pint of Chloros is added at each filling. They are open from approximately 1st April to 30th September each year, according to weather conditions. Other Facilities in the Borough for Open Air Recreation Privately owned open spaces and sports grounds 111.71 acres Council owned open spaces and sports grounds leased to private clubs etc. 67.94 " School playing fields 50.50 " Gunners bury Park (owned jointly by Acton, Brentford & Chiswick and Ealing Councils) 186.00 " Public Baths and Wash houses Brentford. In Clifden Road Brentford, the Council maintains premises containing 21 slipper baths, 14 for men, and 7 for women. The total number using the baths during 1960 was 21,434 persons. Chiswick: In Belmont Road, Chiswick, the Council maintains premises containing 31 slipper baths, 22 for men, and 9 for women. In addition, 2 hip baths are available particularly for the use of elderly persons. The total number using the baths during 1960 was 43,064. In these premises are also 30 washing compartments comprising 30 coppers, a rinsing section, 30 drying horses hot air drying compartments and 2 mangling machines. Ratepayers are entitled to use these washing facilities at a small charge of 6d per hour, and during 1960, 1,594 persons took advantage of the service. -12- VITAL STATISTICS, 1960 Live Births Total Male Female Legitimate 828 435 393 Birth Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population-15.75 Illegitimate 71 33 38 TOTAL 899 468 431 Still births Total Male Female Legitimate 16 6 10 Rate per l000 total (live and still) Births 19.63 Illegitimate 2 1 1 TOTAL 18 7 11 Deaths Total Male Female 595 287 308 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population-10.43 Deaths from Puerperal Causes Puerperal Sepsis - Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) Births Nil Other Puerperal Causes - Deaths of Infants under 1 Year of Age Total Male Female Legitimate 8 5 3 Rate per 1000 1ive Births-11.12 11legitimate 2 2 - TOTAL 10 7 3 -13- Deaths and Death Rate There was again a slight fall in the death rate the figure of 10 43 comparing with one of 10 53 for the previous year. The lowest death rate ever recorded in the Borough was 10 16 in 1953, To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. In 1960, this factor was 1.0 and so the corrected death rate was the same as the crude death rate i.e. 10.43. The corrected rate for Middlesex County was 11.1,, and the rate for England and Wales was 11 5, so the figure for Brentford and Chiswick was well below both the County and the National rates Table I gives a list of Causes of Death as classified according to the International system agreed by the World Health Organisation and in operation since November, 1949, The principal causes of death were:- I960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 Circulatory Disease (including coronary disease) 215 201 222 215 224 206 205 Heart Disease 84 76 99 82 91 96 98 Cancer (including Leukaemia) 126 123 130 135 153 139 162 Coronary disease was the highest individual cause of death in 1960, 113 deaths were attributed to this disease, 64 male and 49 female. The cancer deaths also showed a slight increase entirely accounted for by the increase in deaths from lung cancer. The cancer total has been altered to include leukaemia and corresponding alterations have been made in the totals for previous years for comparison. There were four deaths from leukaemia in 1960 two male, ages 51 and 68, and two female, ages 57 and 64. It is interesting to note that in 1954 which had the highest cancer death rate recorded in this Borough, the deaths from lung cancer numbered 36, 30 male and 6 female, compared with 34 in 1960, 27 male and 7 female. The distribution of cancer deaths in sites and ages is shown below.

This is the lowest number of tuberculous deaths ever recorded in one year.

The ages of these case were:- Males: 16, 22, 22, 25, 55, 58 Females: 66, 78, 86 Three of these died as a result of accidents within the Borough, two pedestrians (aged 58 and 78) and a pedal cyclist (aged 16). In all, 11 persons, including residents of other places,, died as a result of road accidents occurring in Brentford and Chiswick, 3 motor cyclists, 2 motor car passengers, 1 motor car driver, 1 pedal cyclist and 4 pedestrians. Birth Rate The Birth Rate rose from 14 25 in 1959 to 15 75 in 1960. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then gives a comparative birth rate of 14 96 compared with 17 1 for England and Wales as a whole. The national birth rate was the highest since the year 1948. INFANT MORTALITY During 1960 the number of live births recorded was 899, 828 legitimate and 71 illegitimate. There were 18 still- births 7 male and 11 female. There were 10 deaths of infants under 1 year of age (as compared with 22 in 1959), giving an infant mortality rate of 11 12 for 1960, the lowest infant mortality rate ever recorded in the Borough. The local figure compares with an infant mortality rate of 21.7 for England and Wales, which is the lowest national infant mortality rate ever recorded. The graph on page 18 shows the progress of Infant Mortality since the beginning of the century. The number of premature infants born in 1960 was 74 (54 in 1959) including premature stillbirths. Of the 60 premature infants born alive, 2 were born at home, (both survived to the end of one month) 58 were born in hospital, of whom 51 survived to the end of one month. The percentage of premature infants to total births (live and still) is 8 1 The following figures show the percentages of premature infants to total births (live and still) since 1950 1950 1951 1952 19 53 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 3.3 4 5 5.6 4.9 6.0 6.9 6.4 8.4 7. 3 6.6 8.1 For the second time within a decade the premature birth rate has risen to nearly three times the 1950 figure. The fact that one of the highest premature birth rates occurs in the same year as the lowest infant mortality rate reduces the feeling of satisfaction evoked by the latter figure since, although apparently the lives of more premature infants were saved these children are starting off in life with a handicap, the loss of two to eight weeks secure ante-natal growth. Causes of infants deaths are shown in Table II on page 66 -16- MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY Deaths from Puerperal Causes:- Puerperal Sepsis Nil Other Causes Nil During the year, 67 cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified as compared with 70 in 1959. One case occurred after home confinement, 66 were notified from Chiswick Maternity Hospital. 17 of the cases were residents of the Borough. The definition of puerperal pyrexia for notification purposes is "any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade) or more has occurred within fourteen days after child-birth or miscarriage". -17- -18- PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES CONTROL OF VERMIN AND SCABIES By the courtesy of the School Medical Officer particulars regarding the cleanliness surveys in schools have been obtained and are as follows Number of children examined:- Primary Schools 10 925 Secondary Modern School 5.801 16,726 Number of children requiring treatment. 97 Number of children in respect of whom cleansing notices were issued 79 Number of children cleansed by Local Health Authority 41 The figures for infestation with vermin showed a slight increase during 1960. and there was also a substantial increase in the number requiring cleansing notices, which suggests some indifference on the part of parents informed of the verminous infestation discovered. By arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health of Hammersmith, persons requiring cleansing because of infestation with scabies or vermin can be treated at the Hammersmith Cleansing Station During 1960 10 persons were referred for cleansing 7 for scabies 2 for lice and 1 for fleas INFECTIOUS DISEASE In the year 1960 there was a fall in the incidence of infectious disease The rise in scarlet fever notifications observed in 1959 was not continued in 1960p but there was a disturbing increase in the number of notifications of dysentery. Measles The following figures of measles notifications show the fluctuations of this disease during the past ten years 1951 19 52 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 863 413 810 47 659 107 773 330 328 47 Poliomyelitis No notifications of poliomyelitis were received during the year. -19- The Scheme for innoculation against poliomyelitis inaugurated by Middlesex County Health Department in 1956, continued during 1960. Details of the year's work are as follows:- No. of persons who received two injections during the year' Children born 1943-1960 Persons born 1933-1942 Persons born before 1933 who have not passed their 40th birthday Dates of birth unknown Total 882 376 675 33 1, 966 Details are given below of persons who received a third injection during 1960. They have already been recorded as having two injections. Children born 1943-1960 Persons born 19 33-19 4 2 Persons born before 1933 who have not passed their 40th birthday Dates of birth unknown Total 1,566 1,746 284 31 3,627 By the end of the year 9,217 children 16 years of age and under had obtained two injections. Puerperal Pyrexia The number of notifications of puerperal pyrexia was 67 in 1960 compared with 70 in 1959. There was no severe infection, these puerperal pyrexia cases were mild and mostly notified under the statutory requirement to notify any temperature rise to over 100° after confinement in the immediate post-natal period. Smallpox In October, 1960, notification was received that a case of smallpox had occurred in an air line passenger from abroad. Before becoming ill he had unfor tunately visited many places and made many contacts. These had to be vaccinated if necessary and followed up during the period of quarantine. Five contacts (one a school child) lived in the Borough and two other schoolchild contacts, although resident in Acton, attended local schools. No case of illness developed however. Vaccination against Smallpox The following information regarding vaccination against smallpox carried out in the Borough during 1960 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer. Number of persons who during the year were Age groups Total Under 1 1 2 - 4 5 - 14 15 & over vaccinated for first time 348 37 16 26 28 455 re-vaccinated - - 1 8 109 118 Total 348 37 17 34 137 573 -20 - Total number of first vaccinations:- 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 298 373 548 487 438 418 430 531 525 455 The figure for first vaccinations is again down, which is particularly worrying in a year when smallpox did return to London. Although there was a slight rise in the re-vaccination figure this could probably be accounted for by case contacts and their neighbours. Vaccination of persons intending to travel abroad has to be confirmed by the vaccinating doctor on an International Certificate of Vaccination which is not acceptable unless the signature is authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During 1960, 369 such Certificates were authenticated. Scarlet Fever There was a fall in the number of cases of scarlet fever notified and confirmed as such, the figure being 39 in 1960 compared with 91 in 1959 and 44 in 1958. 12 of these cases were admitted to hospital. In two instances more than one case occurred in a family but only one of the cases was a true secondary, i,e. following the first notification after a period equivalent to the incubation period of disease. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria occurred during the year. The last confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough occurred in 1948. Information concerning immunisation against diphtheria in the Borough during 1960 has been supplied by the Area Medical Officer, and is as follows:- Number of children who Age Total Under 1 1 2 -4 5 - 14 completed a full course of primary immunisation 608 99 32 14 753 received reinforcing injections - 18 70 101 189 Number of children at 31 12, 60 who had completed a course of diphtheria immunisation at any time before that date (i.e, at any time since 1 1 46). Age at 31.12,60 i.e. born in year Under 1 1960 1 - 4 1959 1956 5 - 9 1955 - 1951 10 - 14 1950 - 1946 Total under 15 Last complete course of injections (whether primary or booster) A. 1956 - 60 330 2,042 2,506 2,489 7,367 B. 1955 or earlier - -- 177 l,047 1,224 There was again a substantial increase in the number of children receiving protection against diphtheria. The incidence of and deaths from diphtheria in London may have been partly responsible for this. -21- Whooping Cough 40 cases of whooping cough occurred in 1960, Immunisation against whooping cough is fairly general now the inoculation being carried out either simultaneously with that for immunisation against diphtheria or in series alternating with anti-diphtheria inoculation, and outbreaks of whooping cough have not been occurring during the past few years. No deaths occurred from this disease during I960. Food Poisoning Fifty-five notifications of food poisoning were received during the year. Of these, 26 cases were subsequently not confirmed as food poisoning and 26 were found to be cases of Sonne" dysentery. The remaining three cases were considered food poisoning due to the organism Salmonella Typhi murium Dysentery 115 notifications of dysentery were received 24 of these were not confirmed but as 26 notified as food poisoning were found to be infected with Shigella Sonnei, this makes a total of 117 confirmed cases There was an outbreak of Sonne dysentery among school children in the first place, and, before the outbreak was cleared positive cases were found in eleven of the schools of the Borough, During this outbreak 89 families were investigated comprising 416 persons, from all of whom faeces specimens were obtained. 113 bacteriological positives were found among these 58 of whom were school children. As always when infectious disease occurs the opportunity was taken to check on sanitary facilities in various premises, and the lack of washing facilities in the boys cloakroom at one school was brought to the attention of the Education Authority, A further occurrence of gastric indisposition amongst school children was reported in October, but investigation and bacteriological testing of 60 children and staff proved that except in the case of one child no dysentery organism was the cause. The fact that this happening was in the late fruit season of the year may be significant as it is often found that when fruit is abundant there is an increase in the number of cases of intestinal disorder Influenza Influenza was not a problem during 1960 until the end of the year when cases began to occur Two deaths were attributed to influenza. Typhoid and Paratyphoid There were no cases of typhoid or paratyphoid fever during 1960. Tuberculosis The number of notifications of tuberculosis in 1960 was 60 as compared with 73 in the previous year, the pulmonary cases amounting to 51 and the non-pulmonary to 9. The number of deaths from this disease was one (the lowest ever recorded in the Borough) as compared with two in 1959 seven in 1958, four in 1957, six in 1956 and seven in 1955. -22- The figure of 60 notifications includes 27 inward transfers i.e cases notified because they had removed into the borough but who had previously contracted the disease elsewhere. This leaves a total of 33 new cases of tuberculosis occurring within the borough compared with the figure of 35 new cases in 1959. Facilities for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis as well as prevention and after care are provided by the Hounslow Chest Clinic, and home visiting is carried out by Health Visitors attached to this Clinic. They are also responsible for the examination of contacts and for the B-C,G. inoculation for the prevention of tuberculosis. B.C.G. inoculation is now offered to all the Mantoux negative, i.e. susceptible contacts of newly discovered tuberculosis cases; 55 residing in this Borough were inoculated during 1960. A prominent part in the treatment is played by domiciliary chemo-therapy (i.e. treatment with suitable drugs or injections given at home) on the recommendation of the Chest Physician, with the aid of the Home Nurses (formerly District Nurses) provided by the Middlesex County Council. Apart from institutional treatment provided by the local Hospital Management Committees of the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in General Hospitals and in Chest Hospitals, there is also a Middlesex County Council Hostel for chronic ambulant male tuberculous patients. Facilities for convalescence rehabilitation and training are provided by the Middlesex County Council and the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. The social side of the treatment and prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis is dealt with by the Welfare Department of the Hounslow Chest Clinic. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial In August, 1960,, the Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial which commenced in 1950 and has been commented on yearly in the Annual Report, was completed In September, 1959, the Second Progress Report of the investigation was publishedIt shows that B. C.G. vaccination confers a very substantial protection against tuberculosis which persists for at least 7½ years after being given, and , therefore, that vaccination of school children will contribute very substantially to the reduction of tuberculosis in adolescents and young adults. B.C.G. Vaccination As a result of the findings from the tuberculosis vaccinations clinical trial that a degree of protection could be afforded by the vaccination of school children with B. C. G., a scheme was inaugurated in the County of Middlesex for the tuberculin testing and, if necessary, vaccination of school children at the age of 13. During 1960, 905 children were invited to take part in the scheme, 678 consents were received These children were tuberculin tested, and those found to be positive, indicating a previous infection with tuberculosis of a minor or major degree at some period in their lives, were referred to the Chest Clinic for thorough investigation. 151 positives were so referred, B.C.G. vaccination was carried out on 447 children. 6 contacts of cases of tuberculosis were referred to the Chest Clinic. All tests and vaccinations during 1960 under this scheme were carried out by Middlesex County Council staff. 23 HOUSING CONDITIONS OF CASES OF TUBERCULOSIS NOTIFIED DURING 1960 The housing conditions of 51 of the 60 cases of tuberculosis were found to be as follows:- 51 patients lived in sufficiently satisfactory housing accommodation, 17 in flats, 20 in houses. 14 in lodgings or furnished rooms. None of the patients lived in overcrowded conditions, but four of them lived in old, dilapidated property, subject to dampness. The housing particulars of 9 cases were not obtainable either because of removal of patients to other districts or because of resistance of patients to home visiting. Nine new notifications came from homes already returning one or more cases of tuberculosis. 27 cases were inward transfers from other districts and, therefore, had not developed their illness while resident in Brentford and Chiswick. In the 1959 Report it was still apparent that four cases of tuberculosis were still living in unsatisfactory home conditions, two of them had been known to be doing so since 1953, but it is pleasing to report this year that all have had their difficulty resolved either by rehousing locally or by removal from the district. Mass X ray During 1960, the mobile Mass X-ray unit made short visits to three factories and a Convent in the Borough. 3,687 people were X rayed and 2 cases of active tuberculosis and 2 cases of lung cancer were discovered It is now possible to send persons desirous of availing themselves of the facility, to a static Mass X ray Unit at West Middlesex Hospital without an appointment on any day of the week to have an X ray of the chest. This is a very valuable addition to the armaments of preventive medicine and is made use of by many who need reassurance because of vague suspicions of contact. It is particularly useful to the Public Health Department for the obtaining of quick reports on candidates for employment on the Borough Council staff - 24- GRAPH "B" GRAPH OF CASES NOTIFIED AND DEATHS FROM TUBERCULOSIS DURING THE PERIOD 1940 - 1960 NUMBER Notified Cases of Tuberculosis YEAR Deaths from Tuberculosis -25 - FOOD CONTROL Work on the observation and improvement of hygienic reception, storage and sale of food continued throughout the year. No major infringements of the laws on Food were discovered, but there seemed to be some increase during the past two years in the number of articles brought to the Department as having been bought in an unfit condition (see page 29 for list in 1960). It seems as if in shops possibly too much reliance is placed on the refrigerator as a food preserver and not enough care taken that food should be sold early and fresh. It is to be hoped that no food handler will be allowed to forget the importance of this and of scrupulous cleanliness within the refrigerators. Constant education of the food handler is also necessary in respect of smoking where food is prepared, failing to wash hands before touching food other people will be eatingp and the need for personal hygiene at all times, clean hair clean hands, clean clothing. Although there are plenty of food premises which still need much visiting and attention, many of the local traders go far beyond the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act in their sanitary provisions. Mobile traders are required to provide themselves with suitable washing facilities under the Food and Drugs Act„ 1955, and their vehicles require to be checked from time to time. NUMBER AND TYPE OF FOOD PREMISES IN THE BOROUGH Bakers and Confectioners 16 Butchers 40 Club Canteens 15 Confectioners (Sweets) 100 Cafes, Restaurants, Dining Rooms and Snack Bars 71 Factory and Staff Canteens 41 Fishmongers 15 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 54 Grocers and Provisions and General Stores 113 Ice Cream Manufacturers 2 Public Houses and Off Licences 79 School Canteens 18 Total 564 ICE CREAM The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations 1959 Throughout the year, routine visits were paid to two ice cream manufacturing premises situated within the Borough for the purpose of taking samples of ice cream, ice cream lollies, etc. for analysis. In addition, samples were taken from suppliers of ice cream etc. manufactured in premises not within the Borough. Periodic checks of the recording and indicating thermometers on the manufacturing apparatus were made and these were at all times found to satisfy the requirements of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.) Regulations, -26- Sampling During the year, 49 samples were taken for bacteriological examination and the results obtained are as under:- Grade Ice Cream Ice Lollies Cream Lollies Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatisfactory Satis- factory Dovbtful Unsatisfactory Satisfactory Doubtful Unsatis factory I 5 - - 4 - - - - - II 14 - - - - - 3 - - III - 6 - - - - - - - IV - - 13 - - 2 - - 2 Totals 19 6 13 4 - 2 3 - 2 Two samples of ice lollies were taken when metallic contamination was suspected and submitted through the Pood and Drugs Authority to the County Analyst. Although the results showed no abnormal content of metal, the manufacturers willingly replaced certain aluminium containers. Because of unsatisfactory results obtained from samples of ice cream or ice lollies from two manufacturers, swabs were taken from various parts of the machines and equipment for bacteriological testing, Seven samples in one case, and four in the other were taken, and positive results from two sites in each suggested possible sources of pollution, These were subsequently dealt with. The above table has been compiled from results graded according to the following provisional grades set up by the Public Health Laboratory, Ealing in relation to ice cream testing:- Grade Classificeation Bacterial Count I Below 500 II 500 - 20,000 III 20.000 - 100.000 IV If count is over 100,000 and/or Faecal Coli present In the area served by Ealing Public Health Laboratory, the bacteriological count which is carried out and the results of which are tabulated here, is much more sensitive than the chemical tests used elsewhere. Although these chemical tests are sufficient for statutory requirements, the fact that Dr. Hughes of the Ealing Laboratory prefers the stricter control, is something for which the Borough citizens can be grateful as manufacturers of ice cream who have factories in other areas or who send out their products sometimes find that ice cream passed elsewhere as suitable for consumption because of the results of the chemical test, are in a less happy position here because the bacteriological findings lead to investigations and requests for improvement of equipment or hygienic method. -27- Registration of Premises Ice Cream The total number of premises registered for the sale of ice cream in accordance with Sec.16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under:- Sale only 145 Manufacture and Sale 2 Storage only 1 Total 148 Preserved Foods The total number of premises registered in connection with the manufacture and/or preparation of preserved foods under Section 16 of the Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, at the end of the year was as under:- Sausage manufacture 11 Sausages and pickled meat 26 Cooking of ham and other meats 2 Total 39 54 of these registered premises were visited during the year. FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS, 1955 109 contraventions of the above -named Regulations were found and 102 remedied during 1960, Details of these contraventions are as follows:- Contravention Found Remedied Articles/Equipment not kept clean 8 7 Articles/Equipment not in good order 3 3 Pood so placed as to involve risk of contamination 3 2 Pood placed within 18" of ground and not adequately protected 3 3 Personal cleanliness not observed 2 2 Water Closets not kept clean and in efficient order 7 6 Insufficient lighting and ventilation to water closets 4 3 Absence of Wash your hands' notices in water closets 8 8 Absence of suitable and sufficient wash-hand basins 5 3 Absence of hot water at a suitably controlled temperature over wash hand basins 3 4 Absence of soap, nail brushes clean towels, etc. near wash-hand basins 7 6 Absence of or inadequate first aid materials 3 4 Absence of accommodation for clothing not worn during working hours 2 4 Absence of soap, clean cloths etc, at sink - 1 Absence of suitable and sufficient ventilation in food rooms 1 2 Walls, floors, ceilings etc, not kept clean 13 11 Walls, floors ceilings etc. not kept in good order 14 11 Covered receptacle for refuse not provided 8 5 Accumulations of refuse etc, 5 5 Specified foods not stored at prescribed temperature - 2 Inadequate or defective drainage 3 4 Absence of proper storage of food 1 - Animals on premises 1 2 Rat proofing required 5 4 Totals 109 102 No prosecutions were undertaken for contravention of these Regulations. -28- CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS 43 visits were made to catering establishments during the year and in 20 cases it was necessary to give written or verbal intimation that work was required. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year, 18 cases concerning food alleged to be unsound were received in the Department. 10 cases were substantiated, the details of which are as follows:- Complaint Action taken Foreign Matter in bottle of milk Referred to neighbouring local authority for possible action under Regulation 26(1) Milk and Dairies Regulations Foreign Matter in bottle of milk Referred to neighbouring local authority for possible action under Regulation 26(1) Milk and Dairies Regulations Beetles in cheese oatcakes Warning letter Mouldy madeira cake Warning letter Piece of string in loaf of bread Warning letter Beetles in rusks Warning letter Foreign body in tea cake Warning letter Foreign matter in sliced loaf Warning letter Insect in sliced loaf Warning letter Mouldy pork pie Warning letter FOOD SAMPLING By the courtesy of the Chief Officer,, Public Control Department of the Middlesex County Council, the following details of food sampling within the Borough are available - Artic1e Total samples procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 45 2 Bread, Cakes and Biscuits 3 - Butter and Margarine 13 - Cooked Meat 3 - Cream 8 - Drugs 13 - Fish and Fish Products 17 1 Fruit, Fresh and Canned 8 - Ice Cream 21 - Liver 4 - Meat and Meat Products 26 - Preserves 5 - Sausages etc. 5 1 Spirits 10 - Vinegar and Non-Brewed Condiment 8 2 Miscellaneous 16 — Totals 205 6 -29- The total number of samples taken was again less than during the previous year i.e. 205 in 1960 compared with 210 in 1959. The number of unsatisfactory samples increased from 2 in 1959 to 6 in 1960. The following are the details from the Chief Officer" s report on the 6 unsatisfactory samples and the action taken:- Milk Two samples of hot milk were purchased from a restaurant within the Borough and were found to contain added water. Legal proceedings were instituted and a fine of £5. 0s. 0d, was imposed and an order for the payment of costs amounting to £4. 11s. .d. was made. Fish A purchase of smoked haddock from a fishmonger in the Borough proved to be smoked cod. An official caution was issued to the shopkeeper concerned. Sausages Traces of a prohibited preservative were found in a sample of sausages. Subsequent samples were procured and no further traces of the preservative were found. Vinegar Two samples of vinegar were found to be deficient in acetic acid and should have been described as non-brewed condiment. An official caution was issued to the shopkeeper concerned. Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1953 The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the above Acts relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 and which relate to the marking with an indication of origin on certain imported foodstuffs when exposed for sale or sold are complied with. Inspections were made at 217 separate premises of 709 displays of meat,, apples, tomatoes, dried fruit and butter. No infringements were detected. Labelling of Food Order 1953 This Order requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address or with the registered trade mark of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any) and with the names of the ingredients of a compounded food. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 321 articles of pre-packed food was examined at 93 premises to ascertain whether the above requirements were complied with. No serious infringements of this Order were detected. -30- False or Misleading Descriptions As in previous years food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false or misleading statements and descriptions. Much of this scrutiny of food labels can be combined with inspection work under the Labelling of Pood Order. Work under this heading carried out in the whole County has equal effect within the County Districts and examples of where corrective action was sought areas follows: Jam Cream Sponge and Cream Doughnuts which were found to contain imitation cream, press and television advertisements which falsely suggested that cheese was a cream cheese, advertising of sweets which falsely suggested a fruit content and oranges, tangerines and grapefruit described as "seedless" but found to contain seeds. Special Designated Milk No licences are issued by the Middlesex County Council in respect of Dealers/ Pasteurisers or Dealers/Sterilisers in this Borough, Thirteen samples of special designated milk were taken from roundsmen in the Borough during the year and submitted for examination. They proved to be satisfactory. MEAT AND OTHER FOODS There are now no slaughterhouses operating in Brentford and Chiswick. FOOD CONDEMNED DURING THE YEAR 1960 Pruit and Vegetables 35½ tons Meat and Bacon 17¼ cwts Perishable Goods 3½ cwts Tinned Goods 4r501 tins Fish 6 stone Unsound food is disposed of by incineration, tipping or for animal feeding. MILK During 1960, the following licences were issued under the Regulations mentioned:- Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised & Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. Dealer" s Licences 66 Supplementary Licences 15 Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954, Dealer's Licences 22 Supplementary Licences 7 BAKEHOUSES Number in district in use 6 -31- BRENTFORD MARKET Brentford Market is a large wholesale market for the sale of fruit, vegetables and flowers. It covers an area of approximately 11 acres and is under the control of the Borough Council. The Corporation employs a staff of 17 at the market and there are 450 holdings with 150 tenants. On busy days roughly 1,500 vehicles pass through the Market. Modern sanitary conveniences are provided on the West side of the market and free washing facilities are available at this and other conveniences situated in the Market. The Public Health Inspectors pay frequent visits to the market to confirm the maintenance of good sanitation and the Corporation employ the services of a firm of pest exterminators who pay visits to the Market every six weeks to ensure that it is kept free from rodent infestation. During 1960, there was a provision of 30 new wire surrounded enclosures for the temporary storage of empty containers etc. by stall holders. This is a useful public health improvement as it should lessen the amount of litter in the Market, and provided there is a frequent emptying of the enclosures, should help guard against rodent infestation, Situated in the Market are also wholesalers who deal in groceries, tinned foods, etc., and in this connection the Public Health Inspectors visit for the condemnation of such goods as are reckoned to be unfit for human consumption. -32- HEALTH EDUCATION Health Education is an essential part of the day-to-day work of the Public Health Department. Every householder at home, every visitor to the Department the management and workers in factories, the owners and food handlers in shops and cafes, hotels and public houses, all receive items of information which are part of the plan of healthy living whenever they come in contact with any members of the staff This is still the best and most penetrating and lasting method of disseminating health education, but naturally every member of the public does not, even once a year perhaps, have a conversation with a health worker either from the Health Department proper or from the County Health staff who are also able to advise on health matters. A considerable number each year have occasion to visit private practitioners and hospitals, and here again as the importance of prevention is becoming more apparent to medical men and nurses not working directly in the field of preventive medicine, more thought is being given to the advice on health which can be introduced along with the provision of treatment. To reach the people in a more general way poster and leaflet campaigns on topical subjects are carried out. Subjects covered in 1960 included Clean Food, prevention of the spread of colds. Home Safety and special warnings about broken glass on posters, on envelope stickers and in leaflets. Talks were given to local organisations who wished to have speakers on specific subjects at their meetings. It is usual at these talks to allow plenty of time for questions so that problems of individuals can be solved and in the solving, the other participants of the meeting get additional health education. It is found that this type of approach, which is more a form of group discussion than a public lecture, tends to leave stronger impressions on the participants. -33- WELFARE OLD PEOPLE During 1960, 38 cases of old people in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department. These cases are brought to our notice by doctors, neighbours, members of voluntary organisations, relatives or by statutory officers who have found the problems too difficult to solve, and who feel that the only likely solution is compulsory removal of the old person to a place where he or she will have care. It is then our task to try ways and means of rehabilitating the man or woman and to find ways of enabling them to live on in their own homes, which they so much desire to do, or if matters have got so bad that removal is the only answer, to get their willing acceptance of such a decision. Sometimes when this willingness has been achieved, the difficulty of obtaining a place in Hospital or Home, means long delay with conditions deteriorating but this difficulty has become a little easier in the last year or two. One case where two elderly sisters living together were degenerating, was happily solved by an offer of money to place one sister in a nursing home for a month, giving the younger sister time to renew her strength, and with Home Help and other assistance to have their home cleaned decorated and a new life was started for them. In two cases both old ladies, all help was refused, except that one of them did accept the Meals on Wheels service, and after many visits and efforts at persuasion, conditions became so dangerous for them that in each case statutory removal under the National Assistance Act was necessary. Both had hospital admissions, and both did well, one returning to the care of her daughter, and the other being subsequently admitted to a County Home, Details of the 38 cases are as follows:- Removed to hospital 12 Removed to Old People's Homes 2 Remained at home:- (a) meals on wheels and home help provided 6 (b) meals only provided 1 (c) home help only provided 3 (d) home nurse, home help and laundry service provided 1 (e) holiday obtained 2 (f) commode obtained 1 (g) housing repairs carried out and/or cleanliness improved 1 (h) no help required 5 (i) all help refused 3 Died at home awaiting hospital admission 1 During the year a total of 397 aged persons or aged chronic sick persons in the Borough received help from the Home Help Service, and the Home Nurses dealt with 501 old people out of a total of 785 cases. These figures compare with 333 aged persons receiving help from the Home Help Service in 1959 and 533 old persons being visited by the Nurses out of a total of 832 cases. Information supplied by the County Welfare Officer shows that during the year 39 old people from the Borough were admitted to Old People's Homes through the County Welfare Department, including three persons previously brought to our notice in 1959 and one in 1956. 34- The County Council has the duty under the National Assistance Act, 1948 of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them and it does this by admission to its own Homes or by meeting the cost of maintenance in Homes administered by registered Voluntary Organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department is responsible for the County Homes and one such Home is situated in the Borough. Chiropody A service was maintained throughout the year by the Middlesex County Council whereby old people could have their foot defects treated at reduced cost or free of charge. The number of persons treated in this scheme rose from 115 in 1959 to 167 in 1960. The National Health Service Act 1946, empowered Local Health Authorities to make provision for a Chiropody Service. Middlesex County Council accordingly made arrangements for clinics to be started but these had not begun to operate at the end of 1960. A voluntary service of Chiropody is maintained by the Brentford Philanthropic Society for old people in the Brentford end of the Borough and served by a local chiropodist. The fee to the patient is one shilling per foot and 72 persons had treatment in 1960. Old Folks Friendship Club This is a specially built club house opened in April, 1955, for the use as a social and recreational centre of old age pensioners living in Brentford and Chiswick. The club is open Monday to Friday from 1 - 5 p.m. and there is an organiser in attendance. The old people are enrolled as members at their first attendance, membership costs only one penny per week, and there are 250 names on the register. The members can visit every day, if they wish, for rest room or reading room facilities, or just to meet their friends and talk, but many social occasions are provided for them in the way of concerts, whist drives, etc. A television set is installed in the lounge a radiogram in the concert hall and a large billiard table is provided for the male members. Light refreshments are available. This club also arranges summer outings (of which there were four in 1960) and an annual Christmas party. In 1960 a free invitation for a theatre visit was accepted by a large number of members and there were some additional facilities for entertainment at a cheap price arranged during the Christmas season. Exchange visits were also made with a similar club in Oxford. Through this club the members are also able to obtain information about the special services at reduced rates which are available within the Borough for them„ such as laundry shoe repairs and hairdressing and they can be given advice on any difficulties that occur in their private lives, A special blend of tea is also available at an economical price. Members living along are encouraged to make use of the SeO.S. card scheme, and have the card ready and completed with personal details for window display should an emergency occur. This is the only club premises open daily for the use of old age pensioners but there are other clubs meeting in different parts of the Borough once a week to which mobile old age pensioners become attached as members for social and recreational purposes. Brentford Old Folks Social Club This club meets every Wednesday 1.30 p.m. - 5 p.m. and has 150 members. The meetings are social with periodic visiting entertainers. There are 3 or 4 summer outings, a free tea once per month and two annual parties. -35- Old Age Pensions Association (Brentford Branch) The membership of this Club has increased from 65 in 1959 to 90 in 1960, the average attendance once a week being about 85. This weekly meeting is of a social nature with occasional Concert Parties. Two free outings per year, an annual tea and a Christmas dinner are held. Old Age Pensions Association (Chiswick Branch) This association has a membership of over 140, and meets weekly for social purposes. A free annual outing and Christmas Tea Party are held. Other Societies Several of the societies whose functions are classified under WelfareGeneral contribute to a very considerable extent to the Welfare of the Elderly, i.e. the British Red Cross Association, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Blind Club, the Club for the Hard of Hearing, the Chiswick Mission and the two Philanthropic Societies. Slipper Baths Under the scheme for the provision at the reduced rates (2d. per bath) of slipper baths for old people at the Public Baths Establishments, 2,138 baths were taken in Chiswick and 1,383 in Brentford. Meals on Wheels The provision of a hot dinner once a day for an old person living alone may make all the difference between health and malnutrition. The Meals on Wheels Service operated by the Brentford and Chiswick Welfare Organisation continued to expand during 1960. A second van was brought into service in June, 1960 and an increased number of meals ner day were delivered by the double service. 168 elderly persons obtained meals from this service during 1960, and 17,215 meals were delivered during the year. The meals service operated by the Invalid Meals for London continued to supply certain people in the Borough with meals until 1st April, 1960 when these cases were taken over by the Welfare Organisation Meals Service. After that date it was no longer possible to obtain invalid meals for persons not of pensionable age, and this useful service is now available only to sick persons within the area managed by the London County Council. Laundry for the Incontinent Aged The scheme for the provision of laundry facilities for the incontinent aged, started in the autumn of 1956, was carried on throughout the year. Old people in need of this service were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff from various sources, then arrangements were made for the Department's van to call each week to collect the soiled linen, deliver it to the Laundry, and to transport the clean linen back again to the home of the old person. No charge was made for the service but for each case a certificate was submitted to the Public Health Committee. During the year, eight old persons had been recommended for, and obtained this service. -36- Home Safety The North Thames Gas Board who in 1956 offered a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone, continued to arrange for inspections during the year The reason for this was in order to reduce the risk of gas poisoning a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer was to include free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances, GENERAL The District Superintendent of the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the Divisional Director of the British Red Cross Society have kindly supplied information concerning their welfare work in the Borough, St. John Ambulance Brigade There are 4 Divisions of St. John Ambulance Brigade in this Borough. No, 54 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Division No. 135 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Division No. 95 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Cadet Division No. 86 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Cadet Division The No* 54 Brentford & Chiswick Ambulance Division own an ambulance which is used to supplement the County Ambulance facilities. This Division covers duties at the Brentford Football Ground, at various Sports Meetings and cricket matches They supply an Instructor for First Aid and organise St. John Ambulance Association classes for the local Civil Defence Corps and they also instruct in First Aid certain of the local Scout troops. They send attendants to Old People's gatherings and outings and transport by motor ambulance is provided for several members of the Infantile Paralysis Fellowship to their monthly social gatherings. So far as No, 135 Brentford & Chiswick Nursing Division is concerned, its members do duty at local Sports Meetings Public gatherings and Entertainments, All members of the Division are also members of the National Hospital Service Reserve and available for duty in the local Hospital when required by the Matron. One member is available at all times to assist in the Old People s Home in Chiswick and is often called on by the Matron of the Home at a minute s notice.

WELFARE OF THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED The County Council is responsible, under the National Assistance Act. 1948 for the provision of welfare services for the blind and partially-sighted. There are resident in the Borough 97 blind and 34 partially-sighted persons. 21 of these are in full-time employment: 2 are in Workshops for the Blind and 3 are Home Workers, receiving augmentation and supplementation of earnings from the County Council. The remainder are not available for or are not capable of, training or employment, owing to age or infirmity or for some other reason. There are also 6 partially sighted and 6 blind children under the age of 16 years, 9 of whom are at Special Schools. 1 young blind person over 16 years of age is still at school and 1 blind person and 1 partially-sighted person are undertaking vocational training. The County Council provides a Home Teaching service for the visitation of blind and partially-sighted people in their own homes, the object of which is to enable partially-sighted and blind people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows. The duties of the Home Teachers include advising blind and partially-sighted persons on all problems relating to their welfare and of all the available social services, assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities, giving instruction in Braille and Moon systems of raised type, in handcrafts and, where appropriate in the deaf-blind manual alphabet. A handcraft class is held fortnightly at Christ Church Hall Turnham Green. A County Council Old Time Dancing Class for the Blind is held weekly in Ealing and a number of blind residents in the Borough attend. The County Council works in close co-operation with Voluntary Organisations including (a) The Middlesex Association for the Blind who maintain a Holiday Home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind and assist individual necessitous blind persons and (b) The Social Club for the Blind which meets fortnightly at Christ Church Hall, This Club is maintained and managed by a voluntary Committee. -38- The meeting is a social gathering with occasional talks and more usually enter tainment. A Christmas dinner a Spring Buffet Supper and a Summer Excursion to the sea are arranged. Members may go away for holidays at reduced prices to two caravans at Lancing, Sussex provided by public subscription from the citizens of Brentford and Chiswick and maintained by Middlesex Association for the Blind. The British Wireless for the Blind Fund supplies wireless sets to registered blind persons through the County Council which maintains all sets for blind and partially-sighted persons. Other services provided directly by the County Council or through a Registered agency, include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation,, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts and assisted holidays for those in need. WELFARE OF HANDICAPPED PERSONS OTHER THAN BLIND Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially sighted are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948; these cover the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permanently handicapped by crippling diseases or congenital deformity. The County Council's Welfare Department has provided two Welfare Visitors for persons in the Borough who are suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps other than those already mentioned and they work under the direction of the Area Welfare Officer. They visit such persons in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain from statutory or voluntary sources (or both) facilities, appliances, etc., which may benefit them The help afforded may for example enable the disabled person to take part in social activities choral classes, dancing classes, attend handcraft classes , obtain a needed holiday, or by provision of ramps for mechanical chairs, handrails, lifting hoists and the like, give a previously non-existent measure of mobility to a person who was chair-bound or house-bound. Where the circumstances require it, adaptations to houses, including the provision of downstairs toilet facilities, may be undertaken. During i960, special adaptations were made to eight houses in the Borough tenanted by handicapped or elderly persons. Details of the work done are as follows:- Case Work done 1 Handrails on stairs and landing. 2 Handrails at front door and rail on steps in garden. Rail unit on toilet. Handrail on wall above bath, 3 Toilet rail unit. Securing Penryn Hoist to wall. Concrete ramp at front door to enable independent exit to sit in garden.

Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given, and membership of a voluntary organisation catering for a particular handicap is facilitated. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate voluntary organisations, to whom the County Council makes grants in aid. Brentford and Chiswick choral classes for handicapped persons are held on Friday evenings at Belmont School, Belmont Road, Chiswick. Each year this class takes part in the Choral Festival arranged for handicapped persons by the County Council A special coach with hydraulic lifting- device at the back is in use for taking handicapped persons to club activities, handcraft classes and the choral classes. This coaoh is for those who cannot travel by public transport or in any other ordinary car or coach. Wheelchair cases can be lifted into the coach while remaining seated in their chairs. At 31st December, 1960, 121 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped The Brentford and Chiswick Group of the Middlesex and Surrey League for the Hard of Hearing, meets weekly in the Borough, There are social meetings, talks and discussions, outings and visits to other groups in the County The Club has elected a Welfare Officer to visit sick and housebound members, A Club for the Physically Handicapped is maintained by Chiswick Mission (a Branch of the Shaftesbury Society).

The Brentford Society also provided in 1960, a free holiday for 80 old age pensioners and distributed a cash gift of 7/6 and a box of biscuits to 683 old folk at Christmas and the Chiswick Society took 82 elderly residents to the seaside for the day and gave a cash gift of £1 at Christmas to 207 needy elderly people, and £1 5s, 0d (including 5/- from the Mulligan Trust Fund which the Society disburses) to 24 others: Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Servicesbriefly referred to in this Report should applyHo the Area Welfare Officer, Mr, J.F. Cronk, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road Brentford, WELFARE - SCHOOL CHILDREN In 1960, 714,744 meals and 1,043 927 bottles of milk were provided at Schools in this Borough. -40- ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Two stations, one at Brentford and another on the second floor of a building adjacent to the Town Hall, continued in operation during the year for the estimation, by the volumetric method, of the amount of smoke and sulphur dioxide present in the atmosphere. The measurement of grit deposits from the atmosphere was achieved by the use of two deposit gauges, one at the Metropolitan Water Board Works, Kew Bridge and the other in Chiswick House Grounds. Reports on the information obtained from these sources were submitted monthly to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, where they were collated with those from the rest of the country. Tables XI and XII at the end of the book set out a brief summary of the year s recordings and Graphs "C" and "E" have been prepared from these figures. Graph "D" compares the concentration of smoke in Brentford and Chiswick with that of Leeds, Central London and Lerwick, places chosen as representative of areas from industrial (Leeds) to virtually smokeless (Lerwick). 117 visits or observations were made during the year to deal with premises which were suspected of or were alleged to be causing atmospheric pollution. It was generally found that a discussion on stoking methods or the suitability of fuels used helped to solve any smoke problems encountered In one instance,, however, hand firing was replaced by mechanical stoking with very satisfactory results. The National Coal Board is only too anxious to help in these cases and their assistance and advice have been much appreciated. There has been little to choose between the amount of pollution recorded by the volumetric method in Brentford and Chiswick respectively, and the pattern, as shown by Graph "C", varies little from that for 1959 Once again the deposit gauge figures are very variable but, on the whole the Brentford findings were worse than those for Chiswick. It is interesting to note however, that the rainfall figures for Brentford were invariably less than those for Chiswick. It is still rather early to assess the effect of the operation of the Borough's first Smoke Control Area which came into operation on 1st May 1960, but, as time progresses and additional areas are established in this and in neighbouring districts, improvement should be evident in future statistics. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year under review the area of the Borough bounded on the northeast side by the Southern Region Railway Line,, on the south-east the south and the south-west by the River Thames and on the west by the Southern Region Railway (Richmond) Line, was surveyed in detail and a preliminary scheme to make this area subject to a Smoke Control Order under Section 11 of the Clean Air Act, 1956 was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for approval. His consent was obtained and in October, the local authority made an Order known as the "Brentford and Chiswick (No.2) Smoke Control Order, 1960,w This Order was submitted to the Minister for confirmation the suggested date being the 1st August, 1961, This date was subsequently amended by the Minister to the 1st October, 1961, when he confirmed it. The area comprises 288 acres and contains 1,125 dwellings, of which 124 are Council owned. There are also 5 industrial, 16 commercial and 11 miscellaneous buildings. -41- The estimated additional supplies of fuel required per annum were as follows: Smokeless fuels 720 tons Electricity 103,000 kilowatt hours Gas 9,640 therms The estimated total cost of converting fireplaces in dwellings was £9,153 of which sum the National Exchequer pays 40% (£3,661) the Local Authority 30% (£2,746) and the occupier or owner 30% (£2,746). During the winter months of October, November and December, 1960, no smoke offences were reported in the local authority's No. 1 Smoke Control Area and no major fuel supply difficulties arose. During the year, 1,418 visits and re-visits were made in connection with Smoke Control Areas. -42- Chiswick Snoke Brentford Snoke Chiswick Brentford Sulphur Dioxide Sulphur Dioxide -43- Monthly Average Sulphur Dioxide expressed as parts per 100 million (corrected to first decimal place).

It should be noted that the Borough Council's figures include a number of dwellings on the Syon Estate, Isleworth, which is in the adjoining Borough of Heston and Isleworth. Conversion of Council Houses In December, 1957, a plan was prepared for the conversion of 10 semidetached houses and 16 end houses in larger blocks in Lionel Road, and 6 houses in Whitestile Road. The scheme was for the conversion of these 32 premises into flats to double the amount of housing accommodation available on these sites. By the end of 1960, 27 of these houses (24 in Lionel Road and 3 in Whitestile Road) had been converted into 54 flats. In addition, former requisitioned or other properties purchased by the Council were altered as follows;- 17 properties had essential works and improvements done to modernise them and 20 houses were converted into 59 self contained flats of varying sizes. Overcrowding Twenty-three cases of statutory overcrowding were brought to the notice of the Department and were considered by the Housing Committee during 1960. It will be seen from the Housing Statistics on page 55 that nineteen cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. Overcrowding is relieved in various ways, by private arrangements made by the families concerned, by Council re-housing, or by Council nomination under the Industrial Selection Scheme for housing in New Towns, -56 DISINFECTION Premises disinfected Ordinary notifiable diseases 24 Tuberculosis 1 Cancer 4 Premises treated for vermin 28 Premises treated for other pests (wasps, moths, ants and beetles) 18 Routine disinfection of blankets, bedding etc. were carried out on the premises in the above table as required. In addition, certain articles of clothing, 4 parcels of clothing destined for countries abroad, and when necessary, books for both public and private libraries, were disinfected on the Public Health Department premises. An arrangement is in force whereby the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee undertakes to carry out emergency disinfection of smallpoxinfected clothing and bedding on demand. -57- MISCELLANEOUS RODENT CONTROL During the year 4, 150 primary visits and re-visits were made by the Rodent Operatives to premises in the district in connection with rodent disinfestation. The number of premises where treatment was carried out is as follows - Private Houses 324 Factories 10 Shops 39 Schools 5 None of these infestations were severe enough to be classed as major infestations. In addition to the above, two maintenance treatments to the sewers were carried out during the months of March and November, 1960 and the following shows the number of manholes found to be infested. Date Manholes found to be infested March, 1960 18 November, 1960 17 The work of Rodent Control is carried out under the supervision of the Chief Public Health Inspector by two Rodent Operatives who have the assistance of a labourer during such time as the sewers are being treated. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act for the regulation of the sale of pet animals requires all premises in which animals are sold for pets to be licenced by the local authority. One licence was issued during the year, RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT 1951 Three premises in the Borough are registered for the purpose of the above Act, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 2 thereof. ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MASSAGE AND SPECIAL TREATMENT Eight establishments were inspected under this heading and all were found to be satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Purpose No . of Licences Massage only - Chiropody only 3 Massage and Chiropody - Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 1 Massage and Electrical Treatment 2 Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 2 FREE WASHING FACILITIES IN PUBLIC CONVENIENCES Facilities for free hand washing are available in the Kew Bridge both "Ladies" and "Men's", High Road "Men's" and Turnham Green ^Ladies" Public Conveniences, paper towels and liquid soap in tilting dispensers being available in each. In addition a wash hand basin is provided in the 75Ladiesw convenience in Linden Gardens. -58- During the year I960, 13,900 paper towels were issued and, in addition, those who preferred linen hand towels and tablet soap were able to hire these at a cost of 3d. In the same conveniences 3, 424 of these towels were also used. There are no free washing facilities available at the Edensor Road "Ladies" and "Men3 s" nor at the Turnham Green "Men9 sr conveniences. In one other convenience in the Borough • Market Place "Men's and Ladies", free washing facilities are not available as there is no longer an attendant but it is still kept open weekdays and Sundays from 7 0 a, m to 8.0 p.m. pending demolition. This convenience is planned to be demolished in connection with the plan for the redevelopment of the High Street (east of the Courthouse). RIVER POLLUTION Reports on samples of water taken by Officers of Middlesex County Council from the River Brent at points between Wembley and Brentford High Street were again not good. In addition to the increasing amount of oil entering the river, possibly due to the growing use of mechanical tugs and oil-driven barges, some unavoidable pollution of the River Brent occurred during the year as a result of a fractured sewer in a district upstream from Brentford, This was quickly remedied, but samples taken at this time from points on the river in the Borough were unsatisfactory. It has not been found necessary to take action during the year against any person using the River Brent for unauthorised discharge of sewage or trade effluents. STREET TRADING Certain prescribed areas in the district were allocated for street-trading purposes, and were frequently visited to ensure that they were being maintained in good condition and in accordance with the Bye-laws. Visits were also paid to the premises of street hawkers who deal in foodstuffs. CANAL BOATS Number of boats on register Motor propelled boats 89 Other boats 406 MEDICAL EXAMINATION OF COUNCIL STAFF The following medical examinations of Council staff were carried our during 1960:- No. of examinations for entry into the Superannuation Scheme ... 68 No. of examinations following expiration of sick leave 4 -59- NUCLEAR RADIATION It is now known that since the dawn of time, human beings have been subject to nuclear radiation from background sources of varying intensities depending on the nature of the ground on which there is habitation and on the height of dwellings above the level of the sea, but with the discovery of methods of harnessing nuclear energy this has become a public health problem which gradually increases. Dangerous contamination can be caused to an individual who must come in contact with sources of nuclear radiation or drinking water may become contaminated by the emission of effluents from nuclear power stations or research stations into the source of supply of the drinking water , or the air can become contaminated from nuclear station accidents or from nuclear fall-out. The measurement of nuclear contamination is a very complicated process and is maintained by the Central Authority but it has come to be realised that the public health problem is a constant concern of the Local Authority, and so in 1960, the Radioactive Substances Act was passed whereby establishments, industrial or other, using any form or radioactive element or machine would have to be registered with the Central Authority who would thereupon inform the Local Authority of the district in which the establishment was sited. In addition, for several years now the Metropolitan Water Board has supplied with its monthly report on the physical, chemical and bacteriological state of the river water which is the source of London s drinking supply, a report of the findings of analysis of the radioactive content also. Special tests are taken at the effluent areas from the three nuclear esta blishments discharging into the upper reaches of the River Thames. FLOODING IN THE DISTRICT On the 8th August, 1960 as a result of heavy and continuous rainfall, flooding occurred in several areas of Brentford and Chiswick because of the freak nature of one very heavy storm Water entered into a considerable number of premises and in these the Fire Brigade and Salvage Departments had much work to do pumping out waters and removing damaged articles. Assistance was forthcoming to the affected occupiers of the properties from many sources. The Public Health Inspectors visited 75 premises to ascertain whether public health nuisance was being caused. In one premises, stored food was contaminated by flood waters and had to be destroyed, while in certain basement premises backflow from over charged sewers was a most disturbing feature of the incident, but no damage to health is known to have occurred. 60 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North West Metropolitan Regional Rosrprtal Board South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee Brentford Hospital, Chiswick Maternity Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital, Clayponds Wing (formerly Clayponds Hospital) are situated within the Borough and are administered by the South West Middlesex Hospital Management Committee under the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946.
