As from the 9th November, 1900, all the properties which, on or immediately prior to the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District ceasing to exist, were vested in the said Board, or in any other Body, or in any person or persons, for the benefit of any of the Parishes of Wandsworth, Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Tooting Graveney, and which by virtue of the London Government Act, 1899, passed and became the property of the Borough Council (except the several properties referred to in the following clauses, numbered 2, 3, and 4) are to be held by the Council to the use and for the benefit of the Borough as a whole, and the income of all the said parishes (except the income arising from the properties referred to in the said clauses, 2, 3, and 4) is to be received and applied by the Council for the benefit of the Borough as a whole, and all the debts, liabilities and expenses of the said Board of Works in respect of each and every of the said parishes, and of every such other Body or person for and on behalf of each and every of the said parishes (including sums which the said Board was liable to contribute, pursuant to the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1898, and the London County Council (Improvements) Act, 1900, towards the cost of widening York Road, Wandsworth, the purchase of lands between Putney Bridge Road and the River Thames for a recreation ground, and the widening of High Street and Gardener's Lane, Putney, but excluding the debts, liabilities and expenses referred to in the said clauses 2, 3, and 4) are to be assumed by the Borough Council as debts, liabilities and expenses of, and are to be charged upon and borne by the Borough as a whole. 2. The several properties which, on or immediately before the 9th November, 1900, were vested in the Commissioners for Baths and Wash-houses, the Commissioners for Public Libraries and Burial Boards in and for each or any of the said parishes and all the separate liabilities of such Commissioners and Boards, or of such respective parishes in respect thereof, are as from the 9th November, 1900, to the 31st March, 1902, to be held by the Borough Council to the use and for the benefit of such parishes respectively, and are as to such liabilities between the said dates to be an exclusive charge upon such parishes respectively. 3. As from the 31st March, 1902, all the properties which shall on that date be vested in the Borough Council for the purposes of the Baths and Wash-houses Acts and the Public Libraries' Acts, and the income arising in respect of such properties are to be held, received and applied by the Borough Council to the use and for the benefit of the Borough as a whole, and all the debts, liabilities, and expenses of the Borough Council on that date for the purposes of the Baths and Wash-houses Acts and 29 the Public Libraries' Acts are to be assumed by the Council as debts, liabilities, and expenses of, and are to be charged upon and borne by the Borough as a whole. 4. As from the 31st March, 1902, all the properties which shall on that date be vested in the Borough Council for the purposes of the Burial Acts and the income arising in respect of such properties are to be held, received and applied to the use and for the benefit of the Parishes of Wandsworth, Clapham, Putney, and Streatham as a single district, and all the debts, liabilities, and expenses of the Borough Council on that date for the purposes of the Burial Acts are to be assumed by the Council as the debts, liabilities, and expenses of, and are to be charged upon and borne by, the said Parishes of Wandsworth, Clapham, Putney, and Streatham as a single district. County Boundary at Tooting. 5.—When the order for the formation of the Borough was under consideration the London County Council, with the concurrence of the late Wandsworth District Board, made application to the Local Government Board for a Provisional Order providing that the boundary of the County of London at Tooting should be along the south side of the Tooting, Merton and Wimbledon Railway, between Mitcham Road and Tooting Junction at one end, and the extreme boundary of the County of London west of Lambeth cemetery at the other, and that the areas to the north and south of this boundary line should be transferred to the Counties of London and Surrey respectively. The Local Government Board considered it was undesirable to proceed with the matter then as the suggested alteration would affect the boundary of a municipal borough formed under the London Government Act. In December last the London County Council again made application to the Local Government Board for the suggested order, and this Council having approved of the proposal, a public inquiry into the matter was held by a Local Government Board Inspector at which this Council was represented in support of the Order being made. The matter is still under the consideration of the Local Government Board. Mayor. 6.—On the gth November, 1901, Councillor William John Lancaster, J.P., was unanimously elected Mayor. 7.-—The Council presented to Councillor John Lidiard, First Mayor of the Borough, a framed illuminated address, as follows, viz.:— 30 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. Population. Area. Rateable Value. 232,000. 9,221 acres. £1,527,000. November, 1901. "To John Lidiard, Esq., J.P. "We, the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the "Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, desire to express our "high appreciation of your valuable services as first Mayor of "the Borough. "In bringing into operation the provisions of the London "Government Act of 1899 very onerous and complicated duties "were imposed upon the newly-created Borough Council, and "the powers and responsibilities of twenty different Local Authori"ties were placed under its control. "Your intimate professional knowledge of the several Acts of "Parliament regulating the proceedings of the Council, and your "varied experience of the methods of Local Administration have "been most generously placed at our disposal; whilst the greater "part of your valuable time has been devoted to the interest of "your fellow citizens. "We therefore ask your acceptance of this Address as an "acknowledgment of your untiring zeal and self-denial, which "have done so much in laying the foundations of the new system "of Local Government. We record our high appreciation of the "ability, courtesy, and impartiality with which you have discharged "the Duties of the Chair and of the Magisterial Bench, and "recognise the graceful services of the Mayoress in assisting you "in many Social Functions and in the encouragement of Local "Institutions and movements for the public benefit. "We trust that for many years to come this Council will "receive the benefit of your wisdom and experience, and that "the Blessing of Almighty God will continue to be with you and "yours to the end of life." Wandsworth & Clapham Union. 8.—The subject of the division of the Union, referred to in the last annual report, continues to receive the consideration of the Council, who are in communication with the President of the Local Government Board with the view of an order being made by that Board dealing with the matter. Repr esentation on London County Council. 9.—The Council have had under consideration the disproportionate representation of the Borough on the London County Council, and presented the following Memorial on the subject to the Local Government Board, viz.:— 31 The humble Memorial of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. SHEWETH:— 1.—That your Memorialists have had under consideration the large increase in the population and rateable value of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth since the passing of the Local Government Act, 1888. 2.—That each of the Parliamentary Boroughs or Divisions of Parliamentary Boroughs in the Metropolis (except the City of London, which returns 4 members) returns 2 members to the County Council. 3.—That your Memorialists find that in the year 1888 the population of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth was estimated to be 94,933. The rateable value at that time was ,£680,515. 4.—That in the year 1891 the population of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth amounted to 113,244, and from the census returns just published the population appears to be 179,882, being an increase in the last ten years of 66,638, which is 21,028 more than the increase in respect of any other Parliamentary Borough in London during the same period. 5.—That the population of the Borough now amounts to about 3.98 per cent, of the whole population of the Metropolis. 6.—That the area of the Borough is, with the exception of that of Woolwich, larger than that of any other Parliamentary Borough in the Metropolis, being iroi per cent, of the whole of the Metropolis. 7.—That the rateable value of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth is now £1,207,688, shewing an increase of £527,173 since 1888, the rateable value having thus increased 77.46 per cent, in 13 years. 8.—That the rateable value of the Borough is now about 3.45 per cent. of the rateable value of the whole of the Metropolitan area. 9.—That the number of County Council and Parochial Electors in the Borough is 27,624, being 4.04 per cent, of the total County Council and Parochial Electors in London. 10.—That the number of inhabited houses in the Borough is 29.527, being 5.16 per cent, of the total number of Inhabited Houses in the County of London. 32 11.—That the Borough of Wandsworth would be entitled:— On the basis of area to 12 55 Members of the County Council. On the basis of population to 4 53 Members of the County Council. On the basis of Rateable Value to 3^93 Members of the County Council. On the basis of number of Electors to 4^96 Members of the County Council. On the basis of number of Inhabited Houses to 5-88 Members of the County Council. (In the foregoing statistics the City of London is excluded.) 12.—That extensive building operations are going on and new roads are being laid out in all parts of the Borough, and that the increase in Population, Inhabited Houses, Parochial Electors, and Rateable Value will in all probability increase in the future as rapidly as they have done in the past. 13.—That your Memorialists beg to call attention to the following statement, showing tlve difference between the representation of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth and certain other Boroughs. Parliamentary Borough. No. of Members of London County Council. Area (Acres) Population. Ceusus 1901. Number of Electors. Inhabited houses. Census 1901.

YOUR MEMORIALISTS therefore humbly pray that having regard to the facts above set forth the Local Government Board will take such steps as may be necessary to increase the number of representatives of the Parliamentary Borough of Wandsworth on the London County Council. No reply has yet been received from the Local Government Board or the subject. Offices. 10.—The subject of office accommodation for the Council's staff and the provision of a Borough Hall has received consideration. As a temporary measure No. 215, Balham High Road has been hired for the staff of the Surveyor lor the Eastern District; No. 1, Huguenot Place for the staff of the Public Health Department; and an office for the Rate Collectors at No. 144, High Street, Clapham. A strong room has been constructed at the Wandsworth Town Hall and rooms in the basement of the Council House prepared for storing the records of the Authorities whose duties have been transferred to the Council. National Memorial of Queen Victoria. 11.—At the suggestion of the Lord Mayor a public meeting was held at the Wandsworth Town Hall in support of the National Memorial of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. Resolutions were passed at the meeting approving of the erection of a National Monument in front of Buckingham Palace; commending the proposal to the inhabitants of the Borough and appointing the Aldermen and Councillors local Committees for their respective Wards. The subscriptions received amounted to £320:4:3, the expenses incurred to £11:1:1, leaving a balance of £309:3 : 2, which was forwarded to the Lord Mayor. Loving Cup. 12.—The Mayor (Councillor W. J. Lancaster, J.P.) presented to the Council a silver-gilt loving-cup. The cup is an exact reproduction of an old civic cup dated 1794. It is of silver gilt, standing 18-in. high, with bands of foliage and acanthus leaves finely chased. 35 Church Services. 13.—The Mayor, Aldermen, Councillors, and the principal Officers of the Council attended in state services at the several parish churches in the Borough, as follows, viz.:— 1st Dec., 1901.—Parish Church of Putney, St. Mary, High Street. 5th Jan., 1902.—Parish Church of Clapham, Holy Trinity, Clapham Common. 2nd Feb., 1902.—Parish Church of Streatham, St. Leonard, Streatham High Road. 2nd Mar., 1902.—Parish Church of Tooting, St. Nicholas, Church Lane, Tooting. 6th Apr., 1902.—Parish Church of Wandsworth, All Saints, High Street, Wandsworth. 14.—The Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors also attended in state the laying by the Lord Mayor of the foundation stone of St. Thomas's Church, Telford Avenue, Streatham. Charities. 15.—In accordance with the Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooling and Wandsworth Scheme the Charity Commissioners made rules for the nomination of persons to be trustees or to act in the administration of Charities in the several parishes.

The Humble Petition of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, UNDER THEIR COMMON SEAL. SHEWETH:— 1. That the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth contains an area of about fourteen-and-a-half square miles, a population at the census of 1901 of 232,034, and a rateable value (April, 1902) of ,£1,585,274. 2. That a Bill has been introduced into your Honourable House intituled "A Bill for establishing a Water Board to manage the Supply of Water within London and certain adjoining Districts, for transferring to the Water Board the undertakings of the Metropolitan Water Companies, and for other purposes connected therewith." 3. That Clause 1 of the Bill provides that a Water Board shall be established for the purpose of acquiring and managing the undertakings of the Metropolitan Water Companies and generally for supplying wa er within the area described in the Second Schedule to the Bill; that such Water Board shall consist of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and 67 Members; and that the 67 Members shall be appointed by the constituent authorities specified in the Third Schedule to the Bill. 4. That the Third Schedule provides inter alia that the Council of each of the Metropolitan Boroughs of Islington, Kensington, Lambeth, St. Pancras, Stepney, and Westmins'er shall elect two representatives to the Water Board, and that the Council of each of the other Metropolitan Boroughs (including the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth) shall each e'ect one representative to such Board. 5. That your Petitioners are, and their predecessors, the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, were, in favour of a Water Trust being formed for the purpose of purchasing the Metropolitan Water Companies' undertakings, and of supplying the Metropolis (or the water area included in such Companies' powers) with water, and evidence on behalf of the said Board was given on the 9th May, 1898, before the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the subject of the water supply within the limits 38 of the Metropolitan Water Companies in favour of the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis (now the Metropolitan Borough Councils) being represented on the suggested Water Trust. 6. Your Petitioners therefore approve of the principle of the Bill, and whilst reserving their opinion as to the details of the measure, des:re to call attention to the claim of the Borough of Wandsworth to elect two representatives upon the Water Board. 7. In support of this claim, your Petitioners submit the following Table, showing the Area, Rateable Value, Population, and Inhabited Houses of the six Boroughs the Councils of which are each to elect two representatives, as compared with those of the Borough of Wandsworth:— Borough. Area (Acres). Rateable Value. Population. Inhabited Houses. £ Islington 3,091.5 1,912,707 334,991 38,645 Kensington 2,291.1 2,234,034 176,628 22,131 Lambeth 4,080.4 1,871,121 301,895 41,511 St. Pancras 2,694.4 1,802,169 235,317 23,715 Stepney 1,765.6 1,412,536 298,600 31,462 Westminster 2,502.7 5,518,574 183,011 18,366 WANDSWORTH 9,129.7 1,585,274 232,034 37,764 8. From the foregoing Table it will be seen that the area of the Borough of Wandsworth is more than half as large as the combined areas of the whole of the six Boroughs which are to elect two Members each; that the Borough of Wandsworth has a higher rateable value than one of the six Boroughs (viz., Stepney); a greater population than two of such Boroughs (Kensington and Westminster); and a greater number of inhabited houses than four of such Boroughs (Kensington, St. Pancras, Stepney, and Westminster). Moreover, ten of the Boroughs which are to elect one member each have a combined area but slightly in excess of the area of the Borough of Wandsworth. 9. The following Tables show the increase and decrease in population and in the number of inhabited houses between 1891 and 1901, and the increase in rateable value between 1900 and 1902, in the six Boroughs which are to return two representatives, and in the Borough of Wandsworth, viz.:— 39 Borough. Increase of Population, 1891—1901. Increase of Rateable Value, 1900—1902. Increase. Decrease. Increase per cent. Decrease per cent. Increase. Increase per cent. £.

Increase or decrease of Inhabited Houses between 1891 and 1901. Increase. Decrease. Increase per cent. Decrease per cent. Islington 761 — 2.00 — Kensington — 359 — 1.59 Lambeth 2,612 — 6.71 — St. Pancras — 796 — 3.24 Stepney — 2,006 — 5.99 Westminster — 4,713 — 20.42 WANDSWORTH 12,620 — 50.19 — 10. It will be seen that whilst the population has decreased in one, and the number of inhabited houses in four, of the six Boroughs, the population and number of inhabited houses in the Borough of Wandsworth have increased by 49.19 per cent, and 50.19 per cent, respectively, whilst the greatest increase in any of the above-mentioned six Boroughs was 8.44 (populat'on) and 671 (inhabited houses); and that whilst the Borough of Wandsworth has increased in rateable value in the last two years by 14.45 per cent., the greatest increase in rateable value in either of the above mentioned Boroughs is 9.26 per cent. 40 11. That, with the extensive building operations which are being carried on in the Borough of Wandsworth, it is certain that this increase will be continued for many years to come. The capacity of the Borough for future development can be seen by a reference to the report of the Census of March, 1901, which shows that the number of persons per acre for the whole of London was 69 (or, excluding the City of London, 60.80 per acre), whilst the number per acre in the Borough of Wandsworth was only 25.41. The fact that the number of persons per acre in each of the six Boroughs which are to return two Members is so much higher than that for the whole of London (being in one case as high as 169.12 per acre) indicates that the population of such Boroughs cannot increase to the same extent as Wandsworth. It is estimated that there is within the Borough of Wandsworth at least 2,900 acres of land, exclusive of the commons and other public open spaces, not yet built upon. 12. That the area of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth is nearly one-eighth of the whole of the Metropolitan Boroughs (excluding the City), the population about one-nineteenth, the rateable value about one-twenty-secondth, and the number of inhabited houses nearly one-fifteenth, whilst its proportion of the number of representatives allotted to the Metropolitan Boroughs is one-thirty-fourth. 13. That in view of the above-mentioned facts, and of the rapid increase in the population and rateable value of the Borough which has taken place in the past, and which will undoubtedly continue for many years to come, your Petitioners submit that the Borough of Wandsworth should be included in the Third Schedule to the Bill as one of the Authorities to elect two Members to the Water Board. 14. With reference to the provisions in Clause 14 of the Bill that the Water Board shall not be required to make any payments during the first twenty years towards the discharge of water stock, debenture stock, mortgage debts or loans for the discharge of which the period of eighty years is proposed to be fixed, other than the payment in respect of each year towards the discharge of such water stock of the amount (if any) by which the receipts exceed the expenditure of the Water Board in that year,—your Petitioners suggest that after the expiration of the said first twenty years payment towards the discharge of water stock, &c., should be made at such a rate as would pay off two-thirds of the total capital cost of the undertaking within the remaining sixty years, leaving one-third as a standing charge on the Watfer Undertaking, and that the same course should be adopted with regard to further expenditure upon capital account. In the opinion of your Petitioners the great and enduring value of the asset would amply justify a permanent debt equal to one-third of its cost, and such debt would not be a burden upon the ratepayers. 41 Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Bill may be amended by inserting the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworh in the Third Schedule as a constituent Authority entitled to elect two Members of the Water Board, and that Clause 14 of the Bill may be amended as suggested in the foregoing paragraph numbered 14. And your Petitioners will ever pray, etc. 20.—The President of the Local Government Board has since intimated that the claim of the Council for increased representation could not be admitted, as the Borough did not at present quite reach the rat o of population and rateable value fixed for the Boroughs which it is proposed should have two representatives each, and he pointed out that under clause 26 of the Bill the Local Government Board would have power to alter the representation of a Borough on account of the variation of population hereafter. The Council are of opinion that in view of the facts set out in the above petition this Borough is entitled to two representatives. 21.—This Council, having further considered the Bill, infor.red the President of the Local Government Board that the Council was of opinion that the different water rates should be re-adjusted and charged on uniform principles throughout London, and that provisions for securing uniformity of valuation similar to those contained in the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869 should be introduced and made applicable to the districts outside the County of London affected by the Bill. The President informed Mr. Kimber, the Member for Wandsworth, that such matters as the re-adjustment of water rates must be left for the consideration of the Water Board, and that the amendment of the law to secure uniformity of valuation for assessment would be outside the scope of the Water Bill, and would be one of the main objects of the proposed Government Valuation Bill. The following provision (sub-clause 6 of clause 15) was inserted in the Bill in Committee, viz.: — (6) The Water Board shall not reduce the rates charged for the supply of water below those in force during the quarter ending the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and two, if such a reduction would or would be likely to cause a deficiency in the water fund. 42 22.—This Council has been in correspondence with the Local Government Board on the subject, and that Board stated that the sub-clause would not have the effect of preventing the reduction with a view to the equalization of the water charges throughout this Borough, provided that such reduction would not, or would not be likely to, cause a deficiency in the Water Fund, and that the subclause merely prohibited a reduction in the water charges when a deficiency would be likely to be caused. The Council did not take this view of the effect of the clause, and in support of its views in favour of an equalisation of charges pointed out that for a house of the annual value of £30 the charge authorised for the supply of water for domestic purposes varied from £1:4:0 (the Chelsea, Grand Junction, and New River Companies) to £2:2:0 (Lambeth Company). In this Borough there are adjacent houses of the same annual value paying in one Company's district 29/- per annum, and in another Company's district £3 per annum, for the supply of water. 23.—The Bill provided for the appointment by the Water Board of its Chairman and Vice-Chairman, but the Government expressed its intention to appoint the first Chairman and ViceChairman. The Council objected to this proposal. The Members of Parliament for the Borough were requested to support the views of the Council with regard to the Bill. London County Council Tramways & Improvements. 24.—In July last the Improvements Committee of the County Council stated that they had again under consideration the suggested widening of Streatham High Road in connection with a proposal to construct a tramway from the present terminus at Streatham Hill through Streatham High Road to the County boundary; that the Committee had readily adopted the suggestion of the late Wandsworth District Board that a general width of road of about 60 feet should be provided from the Tate Library to the County boundary; that as the alteration of the gradient of the road between Gleneldon Road and Gleneagle Road from 1 in 19 to 1 in 26, suggested by the District Board, would involve the acquisition of property estimated to cost nearly £100,000, the Committee did not feel justified in including that proposal in the new scheme; that the estimated nett cost of the street widenings was as follows, viz.:—acquisition 43 of property, £168,500; site for re-housing labouring persons displaced, £1,500; paving works (excluding laying down and paving tramway track), £25,000; total, £195,000; and asked whether this Council would be prepared to give its consent to the extension of the existing tramway to the County boundary and to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the necessary street widenings. The Council decided without prejudice to the locus standi of the Council in opposition to the scheme to approve of tne construction of a tramway along the proposed route, but urged that as the proposed widenings were rendered necessary only by the construction of the proposed tramway the Council should not be called upon to contribute towards the cost, and that as the County Council did not propose to alter the gradient of the road between Gleneldon Road and Gleneagle Road the road there should be widened beyond the proposed width of 60 feet to meet the difficulty which would be caused to the ordinary traffic by the tramway. 25.—The County Council stated that if this proposal were carried out the original estimate of the nett cost of the improvement would have to be increased by £36,500; and enquired whether the Borough Council would contribute one-third of the nett cost of the complete scheme (total estimated cost, £231,500); and pointed out that it was the general practice of the County Council not to proceed with the proposal for the construction of a tramway or with the necessary street widenings if the local authority declined to make the necessary contribution towards the cost of such street widenings. The Borough Council thereupon withdrew its request for the additional widening between Gleneldon Road and Gleneagle Road, but adhered to its view that as the widenings were rendered necessary only by the construction of the proposed tramways the Borough Council should not be called upon to contribute towards the cost thereof. The provisions in the County Council's Parliamentary Bill relating to the proposed tramway were afterwards struck out. Clapham to Kingston Tramway. 26.—The London County Council having again had under consideration the suggested widening of North Street, Wandsworth Common, East Hill, High Street, West Hill, and Kingston Road in connection with the proposal to 44 construct a tramway from Clapham Common to the County boundary in Kingston Road, forwarded plan of the proposed scheme, and asked whether the Borough Council would be prepared to give its consent to the construction of the proposed tramway and to contribute one-third of the nett cost (£278,500) of the necessary street widenings. The Borough Council decided to approve of the route of the proposed tramway, subject to such conditions as might be hereafter settled by the Borough Council with respect to the scheme, but that as the Battersea Authority was to pay one-sixth only of the nett cost of the widenings in connection with the part of the scheme in that Borough it saw no reason why a larger contribution should be required from this Council; and was of opinion that the tramways should be a double line, the road being widened to not less than 54 feet throughout. Provisions to authorise the construction of the proposed tramway were included in the Tramways and Improvements Bill, but after further correspondence the scheme was withdrawn. Tramway across Putney Bridge. 27.—The only other proposed tramway in this Borough included in the County Council's Tramways and Improvements Bill was a tramway on Putney Bridge in continuation of a proposed tramway along Queen Street, Fulham Palace Road, and High Street, Fulham, terminating in Lower Richmond Road, Putney, at a point about 1 }/2 chains south-west of Putney Bridge. This Council objected to the tramway proposed to be constructed in this Borough on the ground that Putney Bridge was too narrow and that the curve into Lower Richmond Road would constitute a public danger, but the Committee of the House of Commons passed this portion of the Bill, subject to the County Council giving up a piece of land on the north side of Lower Richmond Road for the purpose of widening the public way there. Having regard to the inconvenience to traffic which would be caused during the construction of the tramway across the bridge an undertaking was obtained from the County Council that the work would be proceeded with continuously by day and night and completed within two months from its commencement, and that neither the bridge nor approach thereto should be closed for either vehicular or pedestrian traffic during the construction of the tramway. 45 London United Tramways. 28—This scheme included the construction of a tramway in the detached part of the Parish of Putney which, under the London (Putney Detached) Order in Council, was annexed to the Parish of Barnes, and no action was taken by the Council in the matter. Croydon and District Electric Tramways. 29.—The only portion of this scheme which affected the Borough of Wandsworth was a proposed line (a single line with passing places) from proposed tramways in Mitcham Road, passing along Longley Road to Merton Road, to join the proposed London County Council tramways from Tooting Broadway to the boundary of the County in Merton Road. This Council opposed the construction of this tramway on the ground that Longley Road was unsuitable for a tramway, and that the route was not for the public advantage. The clauses relating to this Borough were struck out of the Bill. London and Brigrhton Electric Railway. 30.—Under this Bill powers were sought to construct a railway commencing at Ranelagh Road, Pimlico, crossing the River Thames at Grosvenor Road ; Battersea Park Road near Haines Street; Wandsworth Road near Albion Road; Larkhall Rise by the SouthEastern and London, Brighton and South Coast Railways; High Street, Clapham, by Wirtemberg Street; Clapham Park Road, Abbeville Road, Clarence Road, Thornton Road; the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, between Sternhold Avenue and Leigham Court Road West; Woodfield Avenue; the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, between Gleneagle Road and Natal Road; the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway near Ellison Road; and proceeding through Mitcham to Brighton. The Bill was opposed by this Council on the ground that it would seriously depreciate property in the Borough without giving any compensating advantage. The promoters failed to comply with the Standing Orders of Parliament, and the Bill was therefore rejected. The City, Wandsworth, and Wimbledon Electric Railway. 31.—The promoters of this Bill sought powers to construct an underground electric railway commencing at Cannon Street, passing under the River Thames near Southwark Bridge, and proceeding along the route of Southwark Bridge Road, Borough Road, 46 beth Road, Tyers Street, Auckland Street, Wandsworth Road, Lavender Hill, St. John's Hill, East Hill, High Street, Wandsworth, Buckhold Road, Merton Road, crossing Arthur Road near the Wimbledon Park station to Wimbledon Hill Road. The Council formally petitioned against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of provisions for the protection of this Borough. The Bill was withdrawn. King's Road Railway (Putney Extension). 32.—This Bill was for the construction of an underground electric railway from the junction of High Street, Putney, with Montserrat Road, passing under the River Thames to a point near the Victoria Station of the Metropolitan District Railway, and terminating by a junction with an intended railway there. The Council presented a petition against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of clauses for the protection of the Borough, and suggested to the promoters that the proposed station at Putney should be nearer Upper Richmond Road than was proposed. The Bill was ordered to be consolidated with the King's Road Railway (No. 1) Bill, and the Select Committee of the House of Commons subsequently reported that it was not expedient to proceed further with the Bill. London United Electric Railways. 33.—The object of this Bill was to obtain powers to construct underground electric railways from Shepherd's Bush and Hammersmith to Barnes, Charing Cross, Clapham Junction and Marble Arch. The part of the scheme which affected this Borough was a railway from the junction of Sangora Road with St. John's Hill, near the Clapham Junction railway station in the Borough of Battersea, following the course of St. John's Hill, Lavender Hill, as far as Garfield Road, from whence the line would curve into Queen's Road, about 200 feet south of Robertson Street, and would then pass along Queen's Road and under the River Thames near the Chelsea Suspension Bridge. As the only portion of the proposed railway which would have been situated in this Borough was a length of about 200 feet in Queen's Road, and the portion of Queen's Road in question having been placed under the control of the Battersea Borough Council, this Council took no action with regard to the Bill. 47 London County Council (General Powers) 34.—This Bill included provisions empowering the London County Council to purchase the site of the Rookery, at Clapham Common, in order that the same might form part of the Common, and authorising the Wandsworth Borough Council to surrender to the County Council its leasehold estate and interest in a portion of the site in question. 35.—The Bill also empowered the County Council, if the Medical Officer should suspect that any case of infectious disease was attributable to milk supplied from any dairy within or without the County to a person residing in the County, or to a person outside the County from any dairy within the County, or that the consumption of milk from the dairy was likely to cause any infectious disease, or where there was a cow suffering from tuberculosis or tuberculous disease, to inspect the dairy and the cows therein. The dairyman might be required to attend before the County Council, and an order might be made prohibiting the supply of milk within the County if the dairy were outside the County, and from supplying milk from the dairy if it were within the County until the order had been withdrawn. The order was to be withdrawn on the County Council, or the Medical Officer of Health on its behalf, being satisfied that the milk supply had been changed, or that it was not likely to cause infectious disease or tuberculosis. The dairyman was to have a right of appeal to the Board of Agriculture. If the dairyman stopped his milk supply at the request of the County Council, the Council might make compensation to him for loss sustained by the stoppage ; and if the order was made without due cause, or if the Council unreasonably refused to withdraw the order, the dairyman, if not himself in default, might recover from the Council full compensation for the damage sustained. Power was given for the slaughter of cows reported to be suffering from tuberculosis. If upon examination after slaughter it was found that the cow was not suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, the dairyman was to be paid the full value of the animal. If it should be found to be so suffering then the dairyman was to receive the value of the carcase. Provision was also made for lists of customers and other information, to be supplied to the County Council; for the isolation of diseased cows, and for notifying cases of tuberculosis. The Bill provided that 48 these provisions should be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the provisions of Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, under which the Metropolitan Borough Councils have some powers to deal with the matter. 36.—Provisions were also included for regulating the manufacture and sale of ice creams or other similar commodity, and providing for licences being granted by the London County Council to keepers of common lodging houses, and for the inspection and regulation of such places. 37.—This Council approved of the Bill. The above-mentioned provisions, with the exception of those relating to the milk supply, were passed. London County Council Subways and Tramways. 38.—This Bill was to enable the London County Council to make a subway and tramway from Victoria Embankment, near Waterloo Bridge, to Theobald's Road, Holborn, and contained provisions authorising the London County Council to make and maintain subways in or under such streets in the County of London as they thought fit, and to lay and use tramways through and along such subways with all necessary stairs, passages, works, and conveniences connected therewith. These latter provisions were afterwards withdrawn. London County Council Electric Supply. 39—The object of this Bill was to confer upon local authorities and the London County Council further powers of purchase with regard to electric lighting undertakings. This Council suggested that a provision should be inserted to the effect that where any electric lighting company has a special order for the supply in a Borough and has supplied from a generating station in such Borough electricity outside the Borough the Council of the Borough in purchasing the undertaking should not be required to pay any compensation in respect of the value of the supply outside the Borough. The proposed clause was not inserted, and the Bill was rejected by the Select Committee of the House of Commons. 49 Borough of Camberwell Electric Lighting, 40.—This was a Provisional Order to authorise the Camberwell Borough Council to produce and supply electricity in that Borough, including a portion of the detached part of Streatham, which was annexed to the Boroughs of Camberwell and Lambeth under the London (Streatham Detached) Order in Council, 1900. This Council consented to the order so far as it concerned the portions of the parish of Streatham transferred to the Borough of Camberwell under the provisions of the London Government Act. Borough Funds Act (1872) Amendment (London.) 41.-—The objects of this Bill were to improve the procedure of promoting and opposing Bills in Parliament and to enable Metropolitan Borough Councils to oromote and oppose Bills for the promotion or protection of the interests of the Borough, subject to such promotion or opposition being determined upon by a majority of not less than two-thirds in the case of the promotion of a Bill, and in the case of opposition to a Bill of a majority of not less than one-half of the Members present at a Meeting of the Council duly convened for the purpose, such majority being in either case not less than the majority of the whole Council; subject also to the approval of the Local Government Board. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, and suggested thac the provisions requiring the vote of a majority of the whole Council should be amended by substituting therefor that the majority should consist of not less than one-third of the whole Council. The Bill was not proceeded with. Cremation. 42.—The Council petitioned in favour of this Bill, which authorises Burial Authorities to provide and maintain crematoria. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 22 nd July. Cheap Trains. 43.—A Conference on this subject, convened by the National Association for the Extension of Workmen's Trains, was held at the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street, E.C., on the 6th December. Councillor Cresswell attended as this Council's representative, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— 50 "That all railway companies should be called upon by the "Board of Trade to comply with the Cheap Trains Act, 1883, by "running a sufficient service of workmen's trains up to eight o'clock "in the morning." "That this Conference, having in view the great hardships "to which a large number of persons of limited means are now "subjected through being obliged to find housing accommodation "at a distance from their employment and through inability, owing "to their hours of work, to use workmen's trains, proposes that all "railway companies should be requested to issue third-class season "tickets with a reduction similar to that granted on first and second"class season tickets." 44.—The Conference also decided to ask the Government to bring in a Bill next session to secure an uniform system of cheap railway fares over areas surrounding large centres of population, and to send a deputation to the President of the Board of Trade in order to lay before him the resolutions passed at the Conference. 45.—The Cheap Trains Bill provided for a fuller service of cheap trains, and fixed a maximum return for passengers by workmen's trains arriving at the various stations up to 8 a.m., and, being in accord with the views of the Conference, the Council petitioned in favour of it. The Bill has since been dropped. Vaccination Act, 1898 Amendment. 46.—This Bill proposed to repeal section 2 of the Vaccination Act, 1898, which exempts from penalties any parent who satisfies the justices that he conscientiously believes that Vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child. The Bill was rejected in the House of Lords. Housing of the Working Classes, repayment of loans. 47.—This Bill would extend the period for the redemption of stock or the repayment of loans for the purchase of land and erection thereon of dwellings or lodging houses for the working classes to 100 years. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill, which is now awaiting second reading. Honorary Freedom of Boroughs Extension. 48.—The Council also petitioned in favour if this Bill, which proposed to extend to Metropolitan Boroughs the provisions of the Honorary Freedom of Boroughs Act, 1885. The Bill has been dropped, 51 Justices' Jurisdiction. 49.—The object of this Bill was to define the matters in which justices in London should be authorised to exercise jurisdiction. The schedule of the Bill contained a list of matters in which such justices might be authorised by Order in Council to exercise jurisdictian. The Council approved of the Bill, and suggested that the hearing of rate summonses should be inserted in the schedule. The Bill was not proceeded with. Polling Arrangements and Polling Districts. SO.—The Council approved of both of these Bills, and requested the Members of Parliament for the Borough to support the same. Shops Bill. 51.—The Council not approving of legislation for closing shops at fixed hours presented a petition against this Bill. Local Authorities Officers (Adoptive) Superannuation. 52.—This Bill would enable local Authorities, if they adopt the Act, to grant superannuation allowances to their officers on their ceasing to hold office by reason of old age or infirmity, subject to such officers contributing a percentage of their salaries for such superannuation. The allowances and contributions are the same as those contained in the Poor Law Superannuation Act, 1896. The Council informed the promoters that it would approve of the Bill if a provision could be inserted to the effect that in the case of the death of an officer his representatives would be entitled to receive the amount of his contributions. The promoters stated that they could not pledge themselves to the insertion of such a clause, but would keep the suggestion in view. 53.—The Council had under consideration the subject of the expediency of establishing a pension or superannuation fund for the benefit of officers and servants of the Council of all grades. A scheme was prepared by a Sub-Committee of the General Purposes Committee and the opinion of counsel taken as to the powers of the Council in the matter. Having regard to such opinion the matter was not proceeded with. The Council subsequently adopted a scale of allowances to incapacitated workmen, particulars pf which will be found on page 69. 52 54.—A Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils was convened by the Paddington Borough Council with reference to the superannuation of officers and servants, at which Councillor Welton attend as this Council's representative, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.:— (a) "That it is desirable that some other system of super"annuating the officers and servants of the Metropolitan Borough "Councils should be established than the present uncertain and "expensive one provided by the Superannuation Act of 1866. (b) "That any pension or superannuation scheme should "extend to officers, servants, and workmen of every grade who "have given continuous service to Local Authorities for the neces"sary period." (c) "That the best method of providing for the pension and "superannuation of officers and servants is by the establishment "of a fund or funds to which contributions shall be made by Local "Authorities and their officers and servants in defined proportions." 55.—No action was taken with regard to the other Bills abovementioned. Constructions under Public ways. 56.—The divisional court having decided that transformer boxes and inspection chambers are buildings, structures, or works within the meaning of section 145 of the London Building Act, 1894, and that therefore notice of their proposed construction must be given to the District Surveyor, the Stepney Borough Council convened a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils to consider what action should be taken in the matter. Councillors Comins and Hunt attended as the representatives of this Council, and the following resolution was passed, viz.:— "That united action be taken by the Metropolitan Borough "Councils for the transfer to them of the duties now exercised by "the District Surveyors under the London Building Acts so far "as those duties relate to electric lighting boxes and similar con"structions under the public way." 57.—This Council approved of the resolution, and the Stepney Council proposes to convene another Conference to consider what steps should be taken to give effect to the resolution. 53 58.—In 1895 a Departmental Committee of the Home Office Cab radius. recommended that the cab radius should be that of the Administrative County of London, minus Plum stead; that drivers should not be compellable after a certain hour in the evening to go any considerable distance, except in the direction of their homes, and that for this purpose the Metropolitan area should be divided into districts and the cabs of each district distinguished by a lamp of a particular colour. No steps having been taken to adopt the recommendation of the Committee, this Council, together with other Borough Councils, urged the Home Secretary to take the necessary steps to extend the cab radius upon the above lines. Combined Drainage. 59-—A Conference on this subject, convened by the Battersea Borough Council, was held at the Municipal Buildings, Lavender Hill, at which Councillor Hunt represented this Council. A resolution was passed that the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a deputation with the view of inducing the Government to introduce a Bill dealing with the matter; that each Council be invited to appoint two representatives and the Town Clerk to join the proposed deputatoin ; and that the Members of Parliament for the Borough be also asked to attend. Alderman Howell and Councillor Hunt were appointed to represent this Council, and the Members of Parliament for this Borough have been asked to join the deputation. The President of the Local Government Board has not yet made an appointment to receive the deputation. Paving Charges. 60.—Places of worship belonging to the Established Church, being permanently devoted to the purpose of religious worship, are exempt from charges under apportionments of the cost of paving new streets ; but Nonconformist places of worship are not so exempt. Representations have been made from time to time by Trustees of Nonconformist places of worship as to this hardship, and the Council presented a memorial to the Government in favour of the removal of the anomaly. 54 Local Government of London. 61.—On the 6th March a memorial sealed by 22 Metropolitan Borough Councils (including Wandsworth) was presented to the Lord Chancellor, calling attention to the difficulties attending the performance of the statutory duties of the Metropolitan Borough Councils owing to the numerous and involved nature of the statutes which they are called upon to administer; and urging that legislation might be introduced at an early date for the consolidation of such statutes. Postal Arrangements. 62.—The Council asked the Post Office Authorities to provide additional facilities to the public of the Borough of Wandsworth for posting letters for the country on Sunday afternoon. The Postmaster-General has since sanctioned arrangements under which letters bearing an additional fee of ]/2 d., and posted in a special box at either the Battersea head office or Putney branch office before 5 P.M. on Sunday, will be included in the mails despatched from London on Sunday nights. Patriotic Schools, War dsworth Common. 63.—In July last the Council called the attention of the London County Council to the probable expiration at an early date of the lease of 20 acres of the land of the Patriotic Commissioners at Wandsworth Common, and suggested that the County Council should open negotiations for securing possession thereof for the use of the public. Attention was also called to the report of the evidence given before the Joint Committee on Charitable Agencies for the relief of widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors, to the effect that the patriotic school and land should be realised at its full value and suitable accommodation obtained at a less cost in a different locality, and the County Council was asked in view of the fact that the land in question formed part of Wandsworth Common and was devoted to its present purpose upon the understanding that the school to be established should afford a visible and permanent memorial of the National generosity which provided the means for its foundation, to do all in its power to prevent any dealing with the land which might lead to its ceasing to be an open space. The matter is still under the consideration of the London County Council. 55 Racing Traffic. 64.—The attention of the Board of Trade has been called to the inconvenience caused to regular travellers on the London & South Western and London, Brighton & South Coast Railways on the occasion of racing fixtures. The Board of Trade, having communicated with the Railway Companies in question, stated that the matter was not one in which they had any statutory authority to intervene. Dates of Elections of Local Bodies. 65.—A Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils convened by the Holborn Borough Coucil on the subejct of the dates of elections of Local Bodies in London, was held at the Holborn Town Hall on the 17th March, when the following resolutions were passed, viz.: — (a) That, in the opinion of this Conference, some re-arrangement is necessary, with a view, if possible, of obviating the inconvenience which is caused by frequent elections, and to overcome the apathy which is at present evinced by the ratepayers of the County of London in exercising their privileges. (b) That, in the opinion of this Conference, it would be advantageous if the elections of the London County Council, the School Board for London, the Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians were held, as far as possible, in different years. Wandsworth Technical Institute. 66.—The late Wandsworth Vestry formerly elected three Members of the Governing Body of the Wandsworth Technical Institute, and the Putney Vestry one. The period for which Mr. J. Bell, J.P., one of such Members, was elected having expired in July, 1901, the Council, as successors to the Wandsworth Vestry, unanimously re-elected Mr. Bell a Member of such Governing Body. Telephones. 67.—A Conference on the subject of the rates to be charged for telephones, convened by the City Corporation, was held at the Guildhall, E. C., on the 23rd December and 13th January last, at which Councillors Henderson and Kipling attended as the representatives of this Council. Resolutions were passed asking the Lord Mayor to bring the question of the agreements with the National Telephone Company and the proposed Post Office scale of charges before the House of Commons, in order that the matter might be referred to a Select Committee 56 with a view to obtaining for London by real and active competition an effective telephone service at a reasonable charge. The resolutions were considered by the Council, but, the matter having been settled by Parliament, no further steps were taken on the subject. Boundaries. 68.—The Mayor and Alderman Ennis represented the Council on a deputation which waited upon the President of the Local Government Board on the 2nd July in favour of the promotion of legislation to make the boundaries of the Metropolitan Boroughs conterminous for all purposes. The London Elections Bill now before Parliament would make the Parliamentary areas conterminous with the areas of Metropolitan Boroughs, and would authorise the Board of Education to alter the School Board electoral divisions so as to prevent such divisions cutting the boundaries of parishes. This Council has petitioned in favour of the Bill. Steam Boat. Piers. 69.—The Thames Steamboat Company (1897), Ltd., having given notice of their intention to run a service of steamboats, the Council forwarded to the Company a copy of a resolution passed in December, 1900, to the effect that the Council was of opinion that in any scheme for river passenger steamers Wandsworth should be included as a place of call, and especially so in the early morning and evening, so that working men, who largely inhabit this district, might take advantage of it; and suggested that the pier should be improved. The Company in reply stated that it was their intention that all the steamers on the Chelsea to Kew service should call at Wandsworth and Putney piers, and asked that a tablet indicating the position of Wandsworth pier should be fixed near the new approach to Wandsworth bridge. The Council undertook to fix the noticeboard, and asked the Company to arrange for all their steamers to call at Wandsworth and Putney piers. The proposed service of steamers was not, however, started. Fee for information relating to Paving charges Sanitary notices, Sic. 70.—The General Purposes Committee having had under consideration the subject of the great and increasing number of applications, by solicitors and others, for information relating to payment of " new street" paving charges, notices under the Public Health (London) Act, rating and similar matters, the Council resolved, on the 27th November, 1901, that a charge of 2/6 be made in each case for such information. 71.—Several letters were received from applicants for information, asking the Council to re-consider such charges, and the Council, on the 5 th February, 1902, decided, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee, that the charge be 2/6 for each of the first three enquiries, and 1/- for each other enquiry in respect of the same property made at the same time by the same party. Disinfection. 72.—The Council, from the 25th March, undertook the disinfection of infected bedding, &c., for the whole of the Borough. Previously, in the parishes of Clapham, Streatham and Tooting the work had been done under contract. Owing to the increase in the amount of work it was found necessary to provide an additional van for the delivery of the goods after disinfection. Mortuary Accommodation. 73.—The Public Health Committee considered the subject of the mortuary accommodation and the provision for holding inquests in the Borough. The Committee were in favour of the mortuary at Wandsworth being used for Putney and Wandsworth, and of a new mortuary being erected at Tooting. Plans were prepared by the Surveyor for the erection of a mortuary on land near the Church Hall, Tooting, at an estimated cost of £550. The Council, however, did not adopt the proposal, being of opinion that the proposed coroner's court and mortuary at Wandsworth will be sufficient for the parishes of Wandsworth, Putney and Tooting. It is intended to erect this building in rear of the Town Hall. Some cottages have already been purchased by the Borough Council for part of the site, and it is expected that an adjoining piece of land will be obtained when the County Council carries out the widening of Red Lion Street in connection with the construction of the tramways there. The Borough Council has separate mortuaries at Clapham and Streatham, and satisfactory provision exists for holding inquests in those parishes. 58 Removal of offensive matter. 74.—The London County Council, in October, made a new byelaw, under section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribing the times for the removal of offensive or noxious matter in or through London, and for preventing any nuisance arising therefrom. The County Council proposed to extend the hours of collection (now 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock in the forenoon during the months of March, April, May, June, July, August, September, and October; and 6 a.m. to 12 noon during November, December, January and February) to from 7 a..m. to 2 p.m. all the year round. The Borough Council was opposed to the suggested alteration, and considered that from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. was a more suitable time. Ultimately it was decided that the times for removal provided by the new Bye-law should remain as before. Removal and Disposal of offensive Trade Refuse. 75.—Owing to the difficulty experienced by shop-keepers and others in disposing of trade refuse and to the nuisance often caused by the manner in which such refuse is removed, the Council decided to undertake the removal of offal from fishmongers', poulterers' and butchers' premises, and garbage from greengrocers' premises in the Borough, at the charge of 4d. per tin for collection and disposal, and 2d. per tin for disposal only. Communications were sent to all such traders, informing them of the arrangements proposed to be made, and a large number have availed themselves of the Council's offer. Special tins are provided for the purpose, which are sealed when full and removed unopened, and the arrangements have been found to work well. The service is not quite self-supporting, but as the quantity of refuse collected increases the collection and disposal will, no doubt, be carried ont at a less comparative cost. Water in Butter. 76.—Representations have been made to the Board of Agriculture with the view of regulations being made under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, with reference to butter containing more than 16 per cent of water. Re-appointment of Sanitary Inspectors. 77.—Soon after the Council came into office application was made to the Local Government Board for consent to the re-appointment of the thirteen Sanitary Inspectors- After a protracted correspondence the 59 eight Inspectors acting under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health have been re-appointed, and one-half of their salaries is now repayable by the County Council. The re-appointment of the five Inspectors acting under the direction of the Surveyors is still under consideration. Housing of the WorKing Classes. 78.—The question of the housing of the working classes has engaged the attention of the Public Health Committee. Plans have been prepared by the Surveyors for building upon sites which appeared to the Committee to be suitable for the purpose at Clapham, Putney and Wandsworth. Two reports were made to the Council on the subject, and the Committee were authorised to expend the sum of £45 in obtaining reports from the Architects to the Guinness Trustees upon the suitability of the sites "and the probable cost of erecting dwellings thereon. These reports have been obtained and are under consideration. 79.—Conferences were convened by the Islington Borough Council and the London County Council respectively to consider the subject of the Housing of the Working Classes; Alderman Wellborne and Councillors Gay and Lidiard were appointed the representatives of the Council. It was decided at the Islington Conference to communicate with the London County Council with the view of settling the sphere of action of the various Metropolitan Authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes. This resolution was considered by the Conference convened by the County Council, when it was decided that, with a view to avoiding dual control and overlapping expenditure, no scheme should be promoted by either the County Council or Borough Council, except after due consultation between the two Councils; that a simultaneous special enquiry should be made by each Council as to the number of persons it may be necessary to house within the area of each Borough; and that modifications of the existing building laws and regulations are essential in order to faciltiate the further erection of industrial dwellings. 80.—The Committee also considered as to providing Municipal Lodging Houses. A plan was prepared by the Surveyor of a site at Hill's Yard, Wandsworth, but upon enquiry it was found that a 6o toad which it was proposed to form would probably not be sanctioned by the County Council. No further action has therefore been taken with regard to this site, and the consideration of the subject has been adjourned. Small-pox. 81.—A Conference was held at the offices of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, convened by the Holborn Borough Council, to consider the subject of dealing with the outbreak of small-pox; Alderman Anderson, Councillor Robinson, and the Medical Officer of Health, the representatives appointed by the Council, attended, and the following resolutions were passed, viz.: — (a) That, in the opinion of the Conference, the powers and duties at present vested in the Guardians of the Poor, with regard to vaccination and re-vaccination, should be transferred to, and enforced by, Borough Councils. (b) That, in the opinion of the Conference, an amendment of the law is necessary, to ensure compulsory vaccination and revaccination of all persons in a dwelling house wherein small-pox has broken out. (c) That, in the opinion of the Conference, it should be declared an offence, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to refuse or withhold information, or give false information, with respect to persons living in a house in which small-pox has broken out, with regard to (a) their names, (b) employment or occupation, (c) schools attended by their children, or (d) as to any persons not living in such house, but employed therein. (d.) That, in the opinion of the Conference, the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to the prevention of infectious diseases, require amendment by (a) shortening the period of twenty-four hours, allowed by section 60, for the master of a house to decide whether he will undertake the disinfection or allow the Sanitary Authority to do so; and (b) extending the provisions of section 63, to the taking of any house, or part of a house, by a person suffering from an infectious disease, or who has been exposed to infection. (e) That, in the opinion of the Conference, all disinfections should be carried out by the Sanitary Authority. (f) That, in the opinion of the Conference, it is advisable that application be made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board to send out to every Medical Officer of Health in London daily lists of small-pox cases only, with age and addresses of patients, as is done weekly in the case of all infectious diseases. 6l Vaccination. 82.—A Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Battersea Borough Council, with reference to the proposed transfer to the Borough Councils of the powers and duties of Boards of Guardians in connection with vaccination, was held at the Municipal Buildings, Lavender Hill, S.W., on the 5th February; Councillors Gay and Robinson, and the Medical Officer of Health, the representatives appointed by this Council, attended, and resolutions were passed to the effect that it was desirable that the powers and duties of Metropolitan Boards of Guardians in connection with vaccination should be transferred to the Borough Councils, seeing that the latter are responsible for the administration of the Public Health Acts, and asking the Local Government Board to take the necessary steps with a view to effecting an amendment of the law in the direction indicated. Tuberculosis. 83.—A Meeting of the British Congress on Tuberculosis was held at the Queen's Hall, Langham Palce, on the 27th July, 1901 ; Councillor Gay and the Medical Officer of Health attended on behalf of the Council. 84.—It was resolved that tuberculosis sputum is the main agent for the conveyance of the viius of tuberculosis from man to man, and that indiscriminate spitting should be suppressed; that in the opinion of the Congress all public hospitals and dispensaries should present every patient suffering from phthisis with a leaflet containing instructions with regard to the prevention of consumption; that the voluntary notification of cases of phthisis had been attended by a promising measure of success ; and that the extension of notification should be encouraged; that the provision of sanatoria is an indispensable part of the measures necessary for the diminution of tuberculosis; that Medical Officers of Health should continue to use all the powers at their disposal, and relax no effort to prevent the spread of tuberculosis by meat and milk; and that, in the opinion of the Congress, overcrowding, defective ventilation, damp, and general insanitary conditions in the houses of the working classes diminish the chance of curing consumption and aid in predisposing to and spreading the disease, 62 Fat-melting works. 85.—The proceedings commenced by the late Board of Works against Messrs. Cole & Son for the abatement of nuisance at their fat-melting works at Southfields, Wandsworth, have been continued. An injunction was obtained in December, 1900, and the defendants ordered to pay the costs of the action. Upon steps being taken to enforce payment of the costs it was found that Mr. Cole had transferred the business to his son. Proceedings were then taken against him in bankruptcy, but no costs have been recovered. 86.—Other information relating to Public Health is contained in the Medical Officer's report in the appendix. Bye-Laws as to overhanging Lamps, etc. 87. —The Council has had under consideration the draft bye-laws proposed to be made by the London County Council under the London Building Act for the regulation of lamps, signs, and other structures overhanging the public way. The Act provides that any bye-laws made for this purpose shall be administered by the local authority (the Metropolitan Borough Councils). The Council was of opinion that several alterations were required in the draft bye-laws, the most important being the exemption of facia boards and sun-blinds from the operation of the bye-laws, the limitation to cases recommended by the local authority of the power of the County Council to dispense with the observance of any bye-law, the reduction of the minimum height above the public way of overhanging lamps and signs from 8 feet 6 inches to 7 feet, and the increase of the maximum projection of such lamps, &c., from the front of the premises from 4 feet to 5 feet. The Council's views were communicated to the London County Council, and that Council still has the matter under consideration. Roads on Boundary of Borough 88. —The Order in Council forming the area of the district of the late Wandsworth Board of Works into the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth provided for certain adjustments of the boundaries of that area. One of the results of these alterations is that where the Borough abuts on the Metropolitan Boroughs of Battersea and Lambeth the boundary is (except in one instance) the middle of the street. On the Council coming into office in November, 1900, arrangements were made 63 with the Councils of the above-mentioned Boroughs for the temporary maintenance of the streets on the boundary, and the London County Council was asked to make Orders under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Act placing some of these streets under the control of the Wandsworth Council and some under that of the Councils of the adjoining Boroughs. During the year an Order has been issued by the County Council placing under the exclusive management of the respective Councils for the purposes of paving, lighting, watering, cleansing, sewerage, and drainage the following streets situate partly in this Borough and partly in the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, viz.: — WANDSWORTH BOROUGH COUNCIL. York Road (from the centre of Usk Road to the centre of John Street). John Street. St. Ann's Road. North Side Wandsworth Common (from the centre of St. Ann's Road to the centre of Spencer Park). Nottingham Road (from Wiseton Road to St. James's Road). Upper Tooting Park (from St. James's Road to Dermot Road). Dermot Road. Boundaries Road (from Dermot Road to the centre of Heslop Road). Nightingale Lane (from a point midway between Endlesham Road and Ramsden Road to Clapham Common West Side). Clapham Common West Side (from Nightingale Lane to the Metropolitan Borough boundary to the west of Balham Hill). Robertson Street (from the centre of Montefiore Street to St. Andrew's Street). St. Andrew's Street (from the centre of Robertson Street to Bramwell Street). Bramwell Street (from St. Andrew's Street to Crichton Street). Crichton Street (from Bramwell Street to Chalmers Street). BATTERSEA BOROUGH COUNCIL. York Road (from a point near the west side of Wilson Street to the centre of Usk Road). St. John's Hill (small portion east of the centre of St. Ann's Road). Spencer Park (portion opposite Spencer Road). Wiseton Road. St. James's Road (from Nottingham Road to the centre of L'pper Tooting Park). 64 Heslop Road. Balham Park Road (from the centre of Heslop Road to the passage from Balham Park Road to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway). Passage from Balham Park Road to the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway). Ravenslea Road (from a point where the Metropolitan Borough boundary enters the road near Gosberton Road to Nightingale Lane). Nightingale Lane (from Ravenslea Road to a point midway between Endlesham Road and Ramsden Road). Lavender Hill (from Wix's Lane to Queen's Road). Queen's Road (from Lavender Hill to Robertson Street). Robertson Street (from Queen's Road to the centre of Montefiore Street). Chalmers Street (from the centre of Crichton Street to Gonsalva Road). Gonsalva Road (from Chalmers Street to Portslade Road). 89.—The Order made in 1889 relating to the maintenance of John Street, a road on the boundary of the Parishes of Wandsworth and Battersea, has been rescinded, the street being dealt with in the new Order. The Order respecting the roads on the boundary of the Boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth has been settled and will be issued shortly. Breaking up of Streets. 90.—The Council has had under consideration the proposal by the London County Council that a representation should be made to the Government as to the necessity for legislation to confer upon the County Council powers to make bye-laws or regulations, and to enforce compliance therewith, as to the manner in which companies and others having statutory rights to break open the public thoroughfares, shall exercise such rights, the time at which such works shall be commenced, and the period within which they shall be completed and the surface of the roads re-instated ; also to compel such companies to move their pipes or wires into any subways constructed by the County Council. The Council approved of the proposal to empower the County Council to make bye-laws or regulations as to the matters referred to, but was of opinion that such bye-laws should be administered by the City or Borough Councils, and that the Board of Trade should be constituted the Appeal Authority in 65 cases of dispute between the City or Borough Councils and any of the companies. The County Council having asked the Metropolitan Borough Councils whether they would support the County Council in making a representation to the Government in the matter was informed of the Council's views on the subject. Street Paving. 91.—A Conference of representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, the Corporation of London, and the London County Council was convened by the Westminster City Council for the purpose of considering the materials and means of paving the streets of London best suited to the different localities and conditions of traffic. Councillors Lorden and Wise, the representatives appointed by this Council, attended the first meeting, when the matter was discussed generally and a Committee appointed to enquire and report as to the course to be taken and to frame resolutions. The Committee has since been engaged in gathering information on the subject, but has not yet reported to the Conference. Retail or Street Markets. 92.—The London County Council having had under consideration the subject of markets, called the attention of the Metropolitan Borough Councils to the unsatisfactory condition from a sanitary and traffic point of view of thoroughfares where street markets are held, and expressed the opinion that without further legislation on the subject no real improvement could be effected. The Metropolitan Borough Councils were accordingly invited by the County Council to consider the desirability of seeking Parliamentary power to become the market authority for retail or street markets within their respective Boroughs, and, as such, to provide proper market accommodation at or immediately near the sites of existing street markets ; and it was suggested that the matter might be dealt with by inserting a clause in one of the County Council's General Powers Bills. This Council approved of the suggestion, and asked the County Council to take the necessary steps for enabling the Borough Councils to become retail market authorities. The subject is still under the consideration of the County Council. Bye-Laws as to House Drainage 93-—The Bye-laws made by the London County Council with respect to house drainage were approved by the Local Government Board in June, 1901. The Bye-laws rendered unnecessary several of the drainage 66 tions of the Council, and were in conflict slightly with others. The Council has therefore amended its regulations in the matter, and all orders with respect to drainage are now made subject to the new Bye-laws and Regulations. Aye-Laws as to deposit of Drainage Plans. 94.—Under the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts Amendment (Bye-laws) Act, 1899, the London County Council is empowered to make Bye-laws requiring persons about to construct, re-construct, or alter drains in connection with buildings to deposit with the Sanitary Authority plans, sections, and particulars thereof. The County Council has accordingly drafted bye-laws on the subject, and asked for the observations of the Metropolitan Borough Councils thereon. Upon an examination of the draft bye-laws it appeared to the Council that the details of the requirements were in some instances cumbersome and unnecessary and would cause unreasonable expense, not only to the Borough Councils but to the public. The Council was of opinion that all the necessities of the case would be met if the bye-laws provided that, with the notice required by the Metropolis Management Act to be given to the Sanitary Authority of intended laying of drains, there shall be deposited a plan and particulars as at present required by the Council's drainage regulations; and that, with the view of preventing the creation of combined drainage in future without the knowledge or consent of the Sanitary Authority, the bye-laws should provide that in the case of addition to or partial re-construction of a drainage system a plan of the whole of the premises within the curtilage shall be deposited. The opinion of the Council on the subject was communicated to the County Council. The proposed bye-laws have not yet been made. Timber yards. 95.—The attention of the Council has been called by the Building A.ct Committee of the London County Council to he dangerous proximity in case of fire of dwellinghouses surrounding timber yards with timber stacked to a considerable height against the boundary walls, and the views of the Council were invited as to the necessity for further legislation for the purpose of preventing timber merchants and builders from storing timber on the roofs of buildings and against the walls of their yards where such walls are adjacent to houses. The Council 67 came to the conclusion that further legislation was necessary for the protection of buildings adjoining timber yards, and the County Council was so informed. Waterside Wharf. 96.—Under the provisions of their Act of 1900 the Wandsworth and Putney Gas Company have conveyed to the Council, free of cost, a piece of land abutting on the river Thames having a frontage to the river of 75 feet, and extending on the south to the centre of Waterside, Wandsworth, a public road which under the Act has been closed. By agreement with the Company boundary walls and gates have been erected, and the Council now has under consideration a scheme for the erection of stores, office, and an electric crane on the wharf. The Council does not own any accommodation of this description for the Eastern District of the Borough, the goods delivered by barge being unloaded at a wharf at Nine Elms, which is further from many part of the area than the depot at Waterside. The wharf has therefore been allocated to that district. When the place is ready for use the additional accommodation afforded will be a great convenience in the carrvinp on of the work of the district. Leader's Gardens. 97.—Several years ago the late District Board purchased a piece of land on the south side of Putney Embankment, between Ashlone Road and Festing Road, as a place for the deposit of street refuse, with the ultimate object of converting the site into a public garden. The estimated value of the land was stated to be £3,000, but the price was fixed at £2,000, the difference (£1,000) being deemed a contribution by the owner (Mr. John Temple Leader) towards the cost of the proposed garden, upon the condition, amongst others, that it should be called " Leader's Gardens." The land having been raised to the requisite level, the Council took the necessary steps for laying it out as an ornamental garden. This work is now practically completed, but in order that the grass, &c., may become more matured and less liable to injury when the public have the use of the ground, the opening of the Gardens has been deferred until the spring of next year. Electrical Traction on Tramways. 98.—The Board of Trade having sanctioned the scheme for the reconstruction for electrical traction of the Westminster to Tooting line of tramways the Council urged the London County Council to push forward the work as 68 rapidly as possible. Towards the end of the period under report the County Council entered into contracts for the execution of the work, and a section of the line at Tooting was shortly afterwards commenced. As the re-paving of the part of the thoroughfare in this Borough had been deferred in anticipation of the re-laying of the tramway the woodpaving there had become very much worn, and when it was found that the work of re-construction was about to be begun the Council entered into a contract for laying new wood blocks in the margins of the carriageway. This work is now being carried out simultaneously with the paving of the tramway by the County Council. The conduit system of electrical traction having been adopted for the line in question the use of wood for paving the tramway tracks is impracticable, as the expansion of the blocks would tend to close the slot between the rails. This part of the road is therefore being paved with granite setts, with the exception of several short lengths where the County Council is laying experimentally a sanitary block paving which is quieter in use than stone and will not expand. 99 —The headway of the railway bridge over High Street, Clapham, was found to be insufficient for the new electrical tramcars, which are considerably larger than the horse-cars now in use. In order to avoid altering the proposed standard type of car the County Council asked to be allowed to slightly lower the carriageway under the bridge in question. The Council gave the necessary permission on the understanding that the proposed works and any works consequent thereupon were carried out at the expense of the County Council and to the satisfaction of this Council. Locomotives on Highways. 100.—The London County Council has had under consideration the question of framing bye-laws under the Locomotives Act, 1898, prohibiting or restricting the use of locomotives on certain specified highways, and asked the opinion of the Borough Council on the subject. The County Council did not propose that the use of locomotives should be prohibited in any part of the Borough, but suggested that their use in the following thoroughfares should be restricted to certain hours of the day (6 p.m. to 8 a.m., or such other times as might be finally decided upon), viz.:—High Street, Putney ; East Hill, High Street Wandsworth, West Hill, Streatham High Road, and Merton 6g Road, Tooting. The locomotives affected by the proposed byelaws would be those of the heavy traction-engine type, the Locomotives on Highways Acts, 1896, having provided that the various enactments restricting the use of locomotives on highways shall not apply to any vehicle propelled by mechanical power if it is under three tons in weight unladen, and is not used for the purpose of drawing more than one vehicle (such vehicle with its locomotive not to exceed in weight 4 tons unladen). The Council, having considered the matter, expressed the opinion that there should be no restrictions upon the use of locomotives on any of the thoroughfares in the Borough, and the London County Council were so informed. Workmen's Super animation. 101.—The Council has on several occasions had under consideration the subject of the superannuation of workmen in its employ who have become incapacitated for further work. In cases where employes have been in the Council's service for many years and by accident, infirmity, or old age are unable to perform their duty with efficiency it appeared probable that in most instances they would, if dismissed, become a burden on the rates by obtaining relief under the Poor Law, and the Council, having carefully considered all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that it was just and expedient that in such cases the men should be superannuated. The District Auditor, having allowed in the accounts of a Metropolitan Borough the payment under the provisions of the Superannuation Allowances to Officers Act, 1866, of a superannuation allowance to a roadsweeper, the Council propose that allowances of the following sums (or sums as near thereto as the provisions of the above-mentioned Act permit) shall be made to workmen, viz.: — After at least 20 years' service, if certified to be incapacitated either by age (not less than 55), or by accident, or disaster not wilfully or carelessly incurred,—7/" per week. After 30 years' service,—8/6 per week. After 40 years' service,—10/- per week. Since the settling of this scale an allowance under it of 7/- per week has been made in one case,—that of a roadman aged 72 years, who had been in the service 25 years. 70 West Hill Wandsworth Widening. 102.—The scheme of the London County Council mentioned in last year's report for the construction of a tramway from Clapham to Kingston Vale, which would pass along the part of this road proposed to be widened, was not proceeded with, and the question of widening the road had again to be considered as an improvement to be carried out by this Council. A plan shewing the widening of the road to 60 feet and an estimate of the cost of the improvement having been prepared and approved, and a valuation of the property required obtained, the plan and estimate were forwarded to the County Council and that Council was asked to contribute two-thirds of the nett cost of the proposed widening. A definite decision has not yet, however, been come to in this matter. In the meantime negotiations for the acquisition of the required property are in progress, and in several cases settlements have been arrived at with the owners. Putney Bridge Road Widening. 103.—Before the acquisition for public purposes of the land now being laid out as Wandsworth Park was contemplated the late District Board obtained an undertaking from the then owners of the estate to widen Putney Bridge Road to 50 feet where it abutted on their land when buildings were erected there. The property having been purchased for an open space the agreement became inoperative. The Council, however, being very desirous that the proposal should not fall through, informed the London County Council of the object of the agreement with the owners, pointed out that a wide thoroughfare in front of the Park was very important, especially as Putney Bridge Road connected High Street, Putney, and High Street, Wandsworth, and asked the County Council to give up sufficient land to widen the road there to 50 feet. The County Council was not at first disposed to accede the full width asked for, but after considerable correspondence agreed to surrender the necessary land. The boundary fence of the new Park has accordingly been set back so as to make the road in front 50 feet wide. With the view of completing the improvement steps are now being taken for paving the part of Putney Bridge Road in question. 7i Upper Richmond Road at the Crescent. 104.—In connection with the woodpaving of Upper Richmond Road between East Putney railway station and Putney Hill the carriageway in front of The Crescent has been widened by taking in part of the footpath, and arrangements have now been made with the owners of property there for adding to the path a strip of the forecourts of the shops 5 feet in width. When the paving works are carried out the step to the forecourts will be abolished. Coopers' Arms Lane 105.—The arrangement made by the late Dsitrict Board with the owners of the Coat and Badge beer-house for the acquisition at their expense of a piece of land in front of those premises for the purpose of widening Coopers' Arms Lane and Walker's Place has been carried into effect. The land in question has been added to the public way and the work of paving the widened thoroughfare is now in progress. Aboyne Road Widening. 106.—Upon taking over Garratt Green the London County Council decided to erect a post and rail boundary fence there. The Green is skirted on two sides by Aboyne Road, which is very narrow in places, and, when the decision of the County Council became known, this Council asked that a strip of the Green should be given up to widen the road in question to 40 feet. The County Council did not see its way to comply with this request, and the fence was erected close to the edge of the road, rendering it still more dangerous to the traffic which is increasing and will become much greater when the Magdalen Park estate, on the other side of Burntwood Lane, is more fully built upon as one of the main thoroughfares on that estate has been laid out opposite Aboyne Road. The Council has on several occasions brought to the notice of the County Council the necessity of widening the road around the Green, but has not yet been successful in inducing that Council to allow this very desirable improvement to be effected. Upper Tooting Road at No. 48. 107. —On several occasions since the widening of this road in connection with the construction of the tramways the late District Board endeavoured to acquire the forecourt of No. 48 for the purpose of widening the road there but was unable to come to terms with the owners. Very shortly after coming into office the Council decided to put in force its 72 sory powers for the purchase of the piece of land required, and, after some negotiation, the owners accepted the compensation offered by the Council. The posts and chains in front of the premises have now been removed and the land added to the public way. Streatham Place. 108.—The negotiations commenced by the late District Board for the acquisition of a strip of land for widening Streatham Place in connection with the re-erection of buildings at the corner of Brixton Hill have been continued and concluded by the Council. The necessary property has been purchased, the site added to the public way, and the buildings set back to the new line. Tooting High Street, formerly (Merton Road.) log.—With one exception all the properties required for carrying out the proposed improvement in front of the St. Leonard's estate, referred to in last year's report, have been purchased, and the Council is taking the necessary proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of the remaining property. The cost of obtaining the necessary land will be borne by this Council and the London County Council in equal proportions. Clapham Park Koad at Park Hill. 110.—The improvement at the corner of Clapham Park Road and Park Hill has been completed. The whole of the premises known as Nos. 122 and 124, Clapham Park Road were purchased, the houses pulled down, and part of the site thrown into the public way. A strip of the forecourt of No. 126 was also acquired and added to the road. The Council has, for the present, retained possession of the surplus land acquired in connection with the widening, and has obtained the consent of the London County Council to a proposed building line there. Burials. III.—The Burial Acts are in force in the Parishes of Clapham, Putney,.Streatham, and Wandsworth. With regard to the Parish of Tooting, the Council came to the conclusion, in view of the fact that the parish 73 yard was still available for burials, that no further steps could be taken at present with regard to the adoption of the Acts. 112.—Upon the application of the Brixton and Streatham Council of Evangelical Free Churches the Council has ordered that in future the unconsecrated portions of its cemeteries should be termed " general," instead of "unconsecrated." 113.—Telephonic communication has been provided between the Burials Department of the Council and the Wandsworth and Streatham cemeteries, and has been found to be a great convenience. Communication between the Burials Department of the Council and Putney Vale cemetery has been ordered, but the line has not yet been completed. 114.—As stated in the last annual report, the Council settled, under the provisions of the Burial Act, 1900, the table of fees payable to ministers of religion, and the same was approved by the Home Secretary. 115.—Upon the establishment of a cemetery at Streatham an agreement was entered into by the late Burial Board under which the Incumbent of Streatham is paid the sum of £200 per annum, and in pursuance of the provisions of the Burial Act, 1900, this arrangement will continue during the life of the Incumbent, or for 15 years, whichever is the longer period. The burial fees in the general ground are paid over to the ministers who perform the service. In Wandsworth all the fees are paid to the respective ministers performing the service. In Putney the arrangements made by the late Burial Board with the Incumbents of Putney and Roehampton for commutation of burial fees have been continued, under which the Incumbents are respectively paid annual stipends of £250 and £\2:10:0, with additional fees of 25/- for each burial beyond 200 in the case of Putney parishioners, and 10 for Roehampton parishioners. Fees in the general ground are paid to the ministers who render the service. 116.—In pursuance of section 1, sub section 6, of the Borough of Wandsworth (Adoptive Acts) Scheme, 1901, each of the Council's 74 cemeteries has been assigned to the parish for which it was provided and to all the other parishes in the Borough in which the Burial Acts are for the time being in force. 117.—Notice has been given to the South Metropolitan Cemetery Company to determine their contract with the late Clapham Burial Board, whereby it was provided that the sum of 30/- should be paid by such Burial Board and their successors for each common interment taking place at the Norwood cemetery. The fee payable by the friends of the deceased is 14/-; each interment therefore costs the Council 16/-. Burial Fees. 118.—During the year the Burials Committee has revised the burial fees in the Council's various cemeteries, with the object of making the fees in all the cemeteries of the Borough uniform and inclusive. This work rendered necessary frequent meetings of the Committee, the preparation of new plans of the cemeteries, and, to some extent, the re-arrangement of the ground. A table of Fees has been drawn up by the Committee and adopted by the Council, and is now under the consideration of the Local Government Board. 119.—The number of interments in the Council's cemeteries for the year ended 31st March, 1902, was as follows, viz.: — Putney Lower Common cemetery 55 Putney Vale cemetery 249 Streatham cemetery 581 Wandsworth cemetery 1,059 Clapham parishioners interred at Norwood cemetery in accordance with contract with South Metropolitan Cemetery Company 350 2,294 120.—Number of grave spaces purchased during the same period:— Putney Vale cemetery 72 Streatham cemetery 146 Wandsworth cemetery 194 412 75 121.—The Council undertakes, when required, to plant and keep in order the graves at the respective cemeteries, at the following scale of charges, viz.:— £ 5. d. Re-turfing grave, 6 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. 0 2 6 Turfing Do and with mould for planting 0 5 0 Maintaining turfed grave in order, per annum 0 5 0 Planting grave, 6 ft. 6 in. x 2 ft. 6 in., with suitable plants or shrubs per annum... 0 0 Do. without monument, with suitable plants or shrubs per annum 1 1 0 Do. brick grave or vault, not exceeding 9ft. x 4ft.; beyond that by special agreement 1 10 0 Planting with summer flowers, 5/- extra. Do. spring and summer flowers, 10/- extra. Turfed or planted graves maintained in perpetuity, by special agreement. Wandsworth Public Baths. 122.—An artesian well has been sunk at the back of the Baths by Messrs. A. C. Potter & Co., but in view of the time occupied in filling the baths a contract has been entered into by Messrs. Westwood & Co., Ltd., for the construction of a storage tank capable of holding about 84,832 gallons of water. A sufficient supply of water is now obtained to meet all the requirements of the baths, without resorting to the Company's water. A considerable saving is effected (estimated at £300 per annum) by the Council obtaining their own supply of water. 123.—The artesian well was tested from 9.15 a.m., January 2nd, to 12.30 a.m., January 3rd, and also from 2.20 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on the latter date, and it was found that the average quantity of water pumped during such periods was 4,725 and 4,744 gallons per hour respectively. The average quantity of water pumped has since increased to 9,180 gallons per hour. 76 124—The Council has, upon the recommendation of the Committee, decided to construct a river wall adjoining the Baths at an estimated cost of £1,250. Application has been made to the London County Council for their licence to carry out this work previous to tenders being invited. 125.—The baths have been lighted with electricity throughout from a steam dynamo served from the main boilers. An alternative connection to the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company's mains has been provided in case of need. The installation was carried out by Messrs. Spagnolettti & Co., to the plans and specification of Mr. Albion T. Snell, who superintended the work. 126.—A water-chute has been provided in the first-class bath, and it has been largely patronised by bathers. 127.—Several water-polo matches have taken place at the baths during the summer season, the receipts therefrom amounting to £14:0:6. 128.—The Mayor (W. J. Lancaster, Esq., J.P.) kindly presented a handsome perpetual challenge trophy to be competed for annually by men resident in the Borough. 129.—Eleven specially-designed medals have also been presented by John Bell, Esq., J.P.; one medal to be competed for annually by women resident in the Borough, the winner to retain the medal. 130.—The average number of bathers using the Baths has increased since last year, and the attendance of ladies has also considerably increased.

The Clapham Divisional Committee have little to report of importance or of special interest. In consequence of additions to the number of volumes it has been found necessary to purchase another section (4,000 numbers) of the Indicator. The heating apparatus also has been repaired, and made much more effective by the substitution of a more powerful boiler in place of the old one, which was worn out, and of some larger coils in place of the old ones. This has been done at a cost of £85 : 7 :6. The number of volumes now in stock is 10,881. The number issued during the year was 72,817, a slight decrease as compared with the previous year. The Committee have suffered a loss of one of their number, Dr. Joseph Sutcliffe (one of the original Clapham Library Commissioners), who died on June 27th, 1901. His place has been filled by Mr. Thomas Stock, who was appointed by the Council on July 24th of the same year. An interesting incident was the presentation to the Library on February 22nd, 1902, of a portrait of Councillor J. Lidiard, First Mayor of Wandsworth, painted by Mr. S. G. Enderby, the gift of Councillor L. B. Sommerfeld. The Librarian and his staff continue to discharge their duties ably and efficiently, to the entire satisfaction of the Committee. On behalf of the Committee, CHARLES P. GREENE, Chairman. 4 Statement of Receipts and Expenditure For the Year ended, 31st March, 1902. Receipts. Expenditure. Mar. 31. 1901 : £ s. d.

Newnes Public Library, Putney. REPORT OF THE DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE FOR PUTNEY. In presenting their report for the year ended 31st March, 1902, the Committee have to record that the residents of Putney and the surrounding districts continue to shew a high appreciation of the advantages afforded by the Library. 11 The Reference Library continues to attract an ever-growing number of readers, many of them being teachers and students. The grouping of the books in classes and the free access to them enable visitors to obtain information with the greatest facility. In the Lending Department the number of borrowers has again largely increased, this being especially noticeable in the case of schoolmasters and teachers, of whom there are 156 holding borrowers' tickets. The News-room and the Magazine-room in the evenings are frequently occupied by nearly a hundred readers at the same time. The Committee have to express their cordial thanks for many generous gifts of books, notably from the Mayor (W. J. Lancaster, Esq., J P.), Sir George Newnes, Bart., M.P., and Councillor J. E. Parker. These gifts have proved most opportune, as lack of funds prevented the addition of any books by purchase. Lending Library. There are 7,147 volumes in this department; and the total number of borrowers is 3,848. New borrowers to the number of 748 joined the Library during the year, but as no new books were purchased the number of books issued, 54,645, is considerably less than last year. Full information, including a classification, may be found on page 14. Magazine Room. For this room there are provided 32 monthly magazines and reviews, three quarterlies, and 37 weekly periodicals, which may be found in the list on pages 18 and 19. The magazines are transferred to the Lending Library at the end of each month, and are bound as the volumes are completed. News Koom. Thirty copies of daily newspapers, including the more important provincial dailies, and 88 weekly newspapers and periodicals are provided in this room. On page 17 of the Report may be found a list of gifts, and on page 13 a statement of the receipts and disbursements for the year. During the year Mr. W. H. Meyrick, who had been a Member of the Committee since June, 1899, resigned, and Mr. Frank Newnes was elected by the Council to fill the vacant position. Twelve General Meetings, and two Sub-Committee Meetings have been held. 14 SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. The Putney Divisional Library Committee desire to convey to Her Grace the Duchess of Marlborough, the ladies of the Committee, to the Librarian, and all who assisted in promoting the Bazaar and Exhibition held on the 7th and 8th of May last, their most cordial thanks. The undertaking proved most successful, and has resulted in the addition to the Library of some 550 volumes, many of them being expensive works, such as Symonds's " Renaissance in Italy," Mortimer Menpes's "Japan," Mrs. Jameson's " Sacred and Legendary Art," modern works on Chemistry, Electricity, and Metallurgy, and useful Topographical works. To the Reference library there have been added modern German, French, Spanish, and Italian Dictionaries, several excellent Dictionaries of Quotations, and the supplementary volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The Committee have placed in each volume a label shewing the means by which it was added to the Library. 13 Statement of Receipts and Expenditure For the Year ended, 31st March, 1902 Receipts.

The Divisional Committee have pleasure in submitting their report on the progress and work of the streatham and Balham Public Libraries for the year ended 31st March, 1902. Stock:— The number of volumes in stock is 25,701 of which 18,395 are located in the Tate Library, Streatham, and 7,306 in the Ramsden Road Library at Balham. The following is a statement of the number of books added to the libraries and the number withdrawn from circulation during the past twelve months:— The Tate Library, Streatham:— Number of volumes in stock at 31st March, 1901 18,380 Number of volumes added during year 878 19,258 Less Number of volumes withdrawn 854 Number of volumes transferred to Tooting Library 9 863 Total stock 18,395 Number of books worn out and replaced 576 Number of books re-bound 1,091 22 Balham Library: — Number of volumes in stock at 31st March, 1901 5,323 Number of volumes added during year 2,030 7,353 Less Number of volumes withdrawn 43 Number of volumes transferred to Tooting Library 4 47 Total stock 7,306 Number of books worn out and replaced 576 Number of books re-bound 824 CLASSIFICATION OF THE BOOKS IN STOCK.

They trust that their efforts to maintain the libraries in a state of efficiency by the periodical examination of the stock, will be appreciated by readers and conduce materially to the general usefulness of the Institutions. Catalogues:— A new Catalogue of Prose Fiction (with " Indicator-Key ") was published in March, and the usual lists of additions were issued at intervals during the year. Number of Books Issued:— 231,425 volumes were issued from the two libraries. The number borrowed during the previous year was 236,475. The slight decrease in the statistics of issues is accounted for by the fact that a large number of popular books had to be withdrawn for re-numbering, etc., during the preparation of the new catalogue.

Additional Fittings:— In consequence of the growth of the libraries it has been found necessary to provide, at both Institutions, extra bookshelving and new cabinets for the card catalogues. Additonal indicators and reading tables have also been supplied to the Balham Library. Balham Library Extension:— In February last, the Local Government Board gave their formal sanction to the borrowing of £2,500 for purposes of altering and enlarging the Balham Library. The work is now in the hands of the builder, and the Committee hope to see, in the course of a few months, the completion of this much needed extension. Reading Rooms:— The Reading Rooms are supplied regularly with a comprehensive selection of the leading Newspapers, Magazines and Reviews. No record is kept of the attendances, but the large number of persons who visit the rooms daily is a gratifying proof of their popularity and usefulness. 235 papers and periodicals are provided at the Tate Library, Streatham, and 124 at the Ramsden Road Library, Balham. Several of these publications are presented by their respective publishers and other donors. A specially-built case, containing a fine specimen of ancient Japanese armour, kindly presented to the Tate Library by Mr. R. W. Essex (a Member of the Committee), has been placed in the Magazine Room. Committee:— The Divisional Committee appointed last year by the Libraries Committee of the Council to administer the affairs of the public libraries in the parish of Streatham, were re-elected for another twelve months. Mr. W. F. Massingham has been appointed Chairman of the Divisional Committee for the current year. A list of the donors of books, etc., is given on page 27. In conclusion, the Committee take this opportunity of stating that they will be glad to receive gifts of books, periodicals, etc., not only for the Streatham and Balham Institutions, but also for the new public library which, through the kindness and generosity of the Mayor (Councillor W. J. Lancaster, J.P.,) is being erected in the parish of Tooting. Signed on behalf of the Divisional Committee, 28th July, 1902. W. F.

It was resolved that ink may be used in the Reference Reading Room at the discretion of the Librarian. The rooms at West Hill library hitherto set apart for ladies were closed and used for storage. By the kindness of Dr. Longstaff, Councillor Riicker, " Anon.," and the Chairman, these rooms have been shelved, and two new bookcases also erected in the Reference Reading Room. The provision of additional shelves is a distinct advantage to the Library. Urgently needed repairs and decoration at West Hill Library were carried out under the direction of the Council's Surveyor by Messrs. Parsons & Co. for the sum of £221 :4:4 ; the estimate for overhauling the lighting arrangements would require an additional expenditure of .£90, which the Committee regret that they could not see their way to. As it was, funds available for new books were much curtailed by the foregoing extra expenditure. The entrance and vestibule at Allfarthing Lane Branch Library were re-decorated, and the Council placed incandescent burners in the public lamp outside. The Council used the Branch Library as a testing station for the electric light. In future the Sanitary Inspectors are taking charge of all books found in a house where there is a case of infectious disease. The Committee would strongly recommend that the same be destroyed, instead of being merely disinfected by the Council. It was suggested by the Battersea Library Committee that borrowers' tickets should be interchangeable throughout the Metropolis. This Committee reported that the plan was not in their opinion feasible. At the November Meeting of the Council the only change in this Committee was the election of Councillor Cresswell in place of Councillor Single, who did not seek re-election. The Committee re-elected Rev. W. Reed, M.A., as Chairman for the ensuing year. The statistics and list of donors for the year ended 31st March, 1902, are appended. (Signed) W.

To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the Borough Council. Sir, and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the first Annual Report of the health and sanitary condition of the Metropolitan Borough, and although my term of office did not commence till the 29th June the Report deals with the whole of the year 1901. Population. The following particulars of the Census taken in March, 1901, are abstracted from the Census returns, and show the total population of the Borough, the population of the several subdistricts, and the population of the nine wards, compared with the Census of 1891 and that of 1896. The area of these divisions as well as the number of inhabited and uninhabited houses is also given. 4 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The last column shows the number of persons to each house at the time of the Census. From this table it will be seen that a large increase has taken place since the 1891 Census, the population at that Census being 155,524, and in 1901, 232,034, an increase of 76,510, or 49 per cent. The total increase, and the percentage rate of increase in the sub-districts, was as follows:— Increase in 10 years. Rate per cent. Clapham 9,550 22.8 Putney 6,368 35,8 Streatham 28,368 64,1 Tooting 10,689 184,8 Wandsworth 21,535 45,9 Whole Borough 76,510 49 The increase was thus least in Clapham and greatest in Tooting. The number of persons in each house was, for the whole Borough, 6.1; and varies from 5.8 in the Fairfield Ward and Streatham to 6.6 in Tooting, and 7 in the Springfield Ward. 5 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

The next Table shows the population of the Borough at all ages and at six different age periods. It is interesting to note that it is only under five years of age that there are more males than females. At all other ages the females preponderate. At ages 25 to 65 there are 12,961 more females than males. TABLE II. Population at six different age periods at the Census of 1901, in the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth.

As this Table includes all institutions in the Borough there is nothing abnormal in the statement in this Table that certain rooms contain 10, 11, and 12 persons per room, these referring mostly to asylums, hospitals, and schools. It is, however, a matter for inquiry that there are in the Borough 2,039 tenements of one room occupied by more than 3,200 persons. In this Borough the percentage of tenements of less than five rooms to total tenements is 42.3, in the Borough of Battersea 61.8, Lambeth 62.7, and Fulham 67.4. Out of the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs the only one that has a smaller percentage is Lewisham, which is 30.9. The word "tenement" is not defined definitely in the Report, but from a perusal of the various Tables it seems that by a tenement is meant a dwelling occupied by a single family or by a separate occupier.

The Table following summarises some of the other Tables, and, in addition, there is shown the death-rate per 1,000 of population from all causes, from Phthisis, and the death-rate of children under one year of age per 1,000 births. A study of this Table shows that Wandsworth occupies a most favourable position. Its death-rate for all causes stands fourth lowest, as also its death-rate from Phthisis, while as regards the number occupying less than five rooms, and the number of tenements under five rooms overcrowded, it stands second. Its position among the Metropolitan Boroughs as regards the deaths of children under one year of age is not quite so favourable, and there is no doubt that this rate is higher than it ought to he.

Of the 1,599 lunatic and imbecile or feeble-minded, 1,331 were resident in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 77 in the Priory, Roehampton (private asylum), 11 in the Huguenots Private Asylum, Wandsworth, and 19 in the Newlands Private Asylum, Tooting, a total of 1,438, leaving 161 of lunatics in the Borough.

The Table following is a fair test of the social conditions of the inhabitants of the Borough, and the percentage of domestic indoor servants to separate occupiers may be taken as fairly representing the wealth of the inhabitants. This total varies largely in different Boroughs, the lowest being in Shoreditch 5.7, and Bethnal Green 5.8, and the highest in Kensington 80, and Hampstead 81.4. TABLE VI.

The population is estimated to the middle of the year, and amounts to 234,702. A correction has, however, to be made for the purpose of ascertaining the exact rates in the Borough, by the deduction of all the inmates of public institutions. The public institutions in the Borough are numerous and are as follows:— Population. Clapham:— Hostel of God 31 Streatham:— St. Anne's Home (St. Pancras Parish) 479 Lunatic Asylum (part of) 222 Tooting:— Tooting Home 640 Fairfield House (Chelsea Parish) 130 Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals:— Fountain Fever Hospital 354 Grove Fever Hospital 417 Newlands Asylum 34 13 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Population. Wandsworth: — Workhouse 709 Royal Hospital for Incurables 308 Home for Inebriates, Northlands 18 Lunatic Asylum, County of Middlesex 1,262 Lunatic Asylum, Huguenots 20 H.M. Prison 1,350 Boys' Home 132 Putney:— Priory, Roehampton 174 a total of 6,280. As, however, a considerable number of the residents in some of these institutions belong to the Borough, especially in the Fever Hospitals, the Workhouse, and the Tooting Home, a deduction of 5,000 has been made from the estimated population in calculating the true death-rate for the Borough. Births. 6,107 births, 3,070 of males and 3,037 of females, were registered during the year, compared with 5,754 in 1900, and 5,545 in 1809. In Table 7 is shown the number of births in each sub-district as well as the birth-rate and the rate of natural increase. 134 births took place in the Wandsworth Workhouse, a decrease of 9 compared with 1900; of these 52 belonged to Battersea, 11 to Clapham, 10 to Putney, 17 to Streatham, 17 to Tooting, and 27 to Wandsworth. 14 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

This birth-rate is the highest since 1893 when it was 27.07 per 1,000, although at the last Census in 1891 this rate was 28.21. As has been the case in previous years, there is a great difference in the birth-rate for the several parishes, Tooting being as usual the highest, viz.:30.6, and Putney the lowest, viz.: 22.11. Last year Streatham was the lowest, with a birth-rate of 23.8. The birth-rate for the County of London was, for the year 1901, 29 per 1,000, or 2.98 above the rate for this Borough. The birth-rates in the different Boroughs of the Metropolis vary very greatly, the lowest being the City of London with a birth-rate of 13.7, and Westminster 17.8, to 37.7 in Finsbury. The natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths, was 12.69, the average for the previous ten years being 11.55. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 1$ Deaths. During the year there were registered in the Borough 3,009 deaths, 1,464 of males and 1,545 of females, compared with a total of 3,142 in 1900, and 3,131 in 1899. This number is 237 under the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The uncorrected death-rate was 12.82 per 1,000, compared with 14 in 1900, and 13.95, the average of the years 1891-1900. To ascertain the corrected death-rate, the deaths occurring within the Borough among persons not belonging thereto must be subtracted, and the deaths occurring outside the Borough among persons belonging thereto must be added. The total number of deaths after correction was 3,130, compared with 3,200 in 1900, and 3,173 in 1899. The average number of deaths for the years 1891-1900 was, corrected for increase of population, 3,350, or 220 above the number for the year 1901. During the year 493 deaths occurred in Public Institutions in the Borough of persons belonging to other places. The next Table shows these arranged according to sub-districts, and also the Institutions in which the deaths occurred. TABLE VIII. Clapham. Putney. Streatham Tooting. Wands'th. Total.

An additional correction has to be made, as some deaths occurred in the Borough of persons not belonging thereto, but as these deaths did not occur in public institutions they were not deducted in the returns which follow. 14 of these deaths occurred: two in Clapham, seven in Putney, four in Wandsworth, and one in Streatham, thus making the corrected total 3,116, Correcting the population for institutions, and taking the number of corrected deaths as 3,116, the true death-rate was 13.56 per 1,000. The next Table shows the total number of deaths, corrected and uncorrected, in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, as also the death-rates. The death-rate for the County of London during the year 1901 was 17.1 per 1,000, compared with 18.3 in 1900, while for this Borough these rates were respectively 13.57 and 14.67 per 1,000. The death-rate for England and Wales was for the same period 16.9, and for the 33 great towns 18.6 per 1,000. Corrected for age and sex distribution the death-rate for this Borough would be higher, viz.: 14.49 per 1,000, or 2.61 below the rate for the County of London. The death-rate for the year is low, and compares favourably with previous years and with the rates for the other Metropolitan Boroughs. There are only three Boroughs in the County of London which have a lower death-rate, these being Hampstead 10.7, Lewisham 13.0, and Stoke Newington 13.2.

In the next Table the number of deaths in institutions outside the Borough is given in detail, but a complete list of these institutions is given after Table I of the Local Government Board's Tables. As the Borough is dealt with as one Sanitary District the deaths of persons belonging to other Parishes in the Borough in institutions such as the Fever Hospitals, Tooting, are considered to be deaths in internal institutions with regard to the whole Borough, and are not included in the following Tables. The same applies to deaths in the Hostel of God, Clapham ; Tooting Home, and the Royal Hospital for Incurables, Wandsworth. 19 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE X. Sex.

The total deaths in external institutions were 543, and of these 279 occurred in the Union Infirmary, 249 in General and Special Hospitals, and 15 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board outside the Borough. The four Tables which follow are inserted by order of the Local Government Board. Table I. differs in some respects from the similar Table in the Report for the year 1900. The population has been corrected 111 the intercensal periods, and consequently the death-rates do not agree with the rates in last year's Report. The estimated population in 1900 was 220,852, whereas the estimated population calculated from the enumerated population was 224,325, consequently the death-rate was only 14.41 per 1,000. Table II. shows the population, the number of births and deaths registered, and the number of deaths under one year of age, for the whole Borough, as well as for the various subdistricts. It also shows these for each year since 1890, and is to a large extent a complete history of the mortality of the Borough for the last 10 years. Table III. shows the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year at all ages and at certain groups of ages in the Borough and in the several sub-districts, and also shows the number of cases removed from each sub-district to Hospital. Table IV. is the general mortality Table for the whole Borough, showing the number of deaths at all ages, and at certain groups of ages, arranged as to cause of death. This Table is in many respects more complete than the one in the Report for 1900. This also shows the total number of deaths in each sub-district, and the number of deaths in public institutions in the district. 21 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XI.

Ages at Death. Of the total deaths in the Borough during the year, 26.07 per cent. were of infants under one year of age, 36.07 of children under five years, 40.64 per cent. of persons from 5 to 65 years, and 23.29 of persons over 60 years. These percentages compare very favourably with preceding years. Infantile Death-rate. The infantile death-rate calculated per 1,000 births was 133, compared with 143 in 1900, and 140 the decennial average. The infantile death-rate for the County of London was 148 per 1,000 births, compared with 158 in 1900. In the several sub-districts this death-rate was as follows in 1900 and 1901: — Clapham 144 130 Putney 146 121 Streatham 116 123 Tooting 178 196 Wandsworth 162 129 This death-rate was lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting. The death-rate for the latter being no less than 63 per 1,000 above the rate for the whole Borough. The following Table shows the population, number of deaths, and the rate per 1,000 at six age periods: — TABLE XVI. Population at Census. No. of Deaths. Rate per 1,000.

It is not possible at present to give these rates for the separate sub-districts, as, so far, the populations at each age period have only been published for the whole Borough. The cause of the high mortality in Tooting under one year was the large number of deaths from diarrhoea, premature birth, and developmental diseases, no fewer than 62 out of a total of 115 being due to the above-mentioned causes. Zymotic Diseases. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these diseases that occurred during the year. This Table is corrected for institutions, as a large number of deaths registered in the Borough occurred in the Fountain and Grove Fever Hospitals, and belong to other Metropolitan Boroughs. The number aboveor below the corrected decennial average is also shown. TABLE XVII. I89I 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 I900 19O1 1901 No above corrected average.

These diseases were the cause of 426 deaths, 48 less than last year, and 166 below the decennial average. Small Pox, for the first time since 1895, appears as the cause of three deaths, while Diphtheria, although one above last year, is 43.5 under the corrected decennial average. With the exception of Diarrhoea, and other zymotic diseases, all the others are under; and Influenza, Whooping Cough, and Measles, considerably under, the average for the last 10 years. The death-rate per 1,000 from the above-mentioned zymotic diseases was 1.81, compared with 2.12 in 1900, and 2.6 in 1899. For the County of London the death-rate from the principal zymotic diseases was 2.22, and for this Borough 1.55 per 1,000, or several lowest in the 28 Metropolitan Boroughs. In institutions situated outside the Borough there occurred 51 deaths of persons belonging to the Borough (14 to Clapham, seven to Tooting, and 21 to Wandsworth). Of these 28 occurred in the Union Infirmary: 12 from Measles, eight from Whooping Cough, four from Influenza, two from Erysipelas, and two from Diarrhoea; eight in General and Special Hospitals: six from Diarrhoea, one from Whooping Cough, and one from other septic diseases; and 15 in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board: three from Small Pox, four from Scarlet Fveer, and eight from Diphtheria. In internal institutions there occurred 188 deaths from Zymotic Diseases of persons belonging to other places. 60 from Scarlet -Fever, 91 from Diphtheria, 26 from Enteric Fever, two from Whooping Cough, three from Measles, and one from other septic diseases in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board: three from Small Pox, four from Scarlet Fever, and house; and one from Influenza in the Royal Hospital for Incurables. Including Enteritis, the total number of deaths was 482, and the death-rate 2.05, compared with 2.12 per 1,000 in 1900. 29 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The next Table shows the death-rate from zymotic diseases, including Influenza, for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts in the Borough, for the year 1901, as well as for the 10 years preceding. TABLE XVIII. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 Clapham 2.2 3.01 3.43 2.4 2.86 3.12 2.35 3.01 3.33 1.85 2.09 Putney 1.4 2.2 3.4 1.6 1.8 2.7 2.0 2.8 1.65 1.95 1.02 Streatham 2.2 2.5 1.9 1.6 1.8 2.1 1.9 2.1 2.29 1.7 1.14 Tooting 2.39 2.28 2.95 3.56 2.12 3.15 1.00 2.27 2.17 2.84 3.38 Wandsworth 2.3 4.2 3.3 2.64 2.03 3.96 2.8 3.59 2.73 2.25 2.20 Borough 2.17 3.13 3.00 2.28 2.16 2.98 2.22 2.90 2.55 2.10 1.81 Putney had the lowest death-rate from zymotic diseases during the year, and Tooting the highest. With the exception of Clapham and Tooting, which show a perceptible increase, all the other sub-districts show a decrease. In Clapham the mortality from these diseases was in 1900 exceptionally low, the total amounting to 94 only, or 47 under the corrected decennial average, and in 1901 the number of deaths was 108, 14 above last year, but 50 under the average. The increase in the mortality in iqoi is not therefore serious, and was almost wholly accounted for by the increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea. The high rate in Tooting was due chiefly to the large increase in the number of deaths from Diarrhoea, 29 deaths having occurred, compared with 37 in 1900. On the whole, the Zymotic death-rate is not high, and is considerably under the average, notwithstanding the enormous 30 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. increase of the population in some of the districts, and also that such increase is chiefly among the industrial and labouring classes. It is shown in the Table that the corrected zymotic deathrate for the year is much lower than in any previous year. The average death-rate for the last 10 years was 2.54 per 1,000, compared with only 1.81 in 1901. The Table is more correct than in former Reports, as the rates have been calculated from the population estimated from the Census returns, and shown on Table II. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The total number of infectious disease certificates received during the year for the whole Borough and for the separate sub-districts is shown on Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. The number received in the Borough since the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was as under: — TABLE XIX. 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 1901 Small Pox 4 ... 29 1 15 1 2 1 ... 4 34 Scarlatina 453 887 1256 673 659 983 1014 703 894 672 684 Diphtheria 164 242 398 321 266 286 569 581 615 454 466 Membranous Croup 8 17 33 22 21 3 7 8 6 6 3 Typhus 1 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

Total 1,517 934 59 26 85 From the Table it will be seen that 1,517 cases were notified, seven more than in 1900, but 473 under the corrected decennial average. Of Scarlet Fever 684 cases were notified, compared with 672; of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 469, compared with 153; of Puerperal Fever 14, compared with 15 ; and of Erysipelas 219, compared with 205. 32 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Enteric Fever shows a decided decrease, and Puerperal Fever a small decrease, while there is a slight increase in the case of the other diseases. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 6.4, compared with 6.7 in 1900. This rate was as follows in the separate sub-districts:—Clapham, 7.1 ; Putney, 3.2; Streatham, 5.3; Tooting, 8.6; and Wandsworth, 7.6 In the County of London the rate was 8.8, compared with 7.7 in 1900. The death-rate from the notifiable diseases was: in the Borough .36 per 1,000, Clapham .36, Putney .32, Streatham, .18, Tooting .69, and Wandsworth .47. In the County of London this rate was .70 per 1,000, or nearly double the rate in this Borough. The Chart shows the number of cases of Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Enteric Fever notified in each month of the year. One case of Scarlet Fever and seven cases of Erysipelas were notified from the Workhouse, one of Erysipelas from the Middlesex County Asylum, one of Erysipelas from the Royal Hospital for Incurables, one of Typhoid from the Prison, one of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria from St. Anne's Home, Streatham, two of Erysipelas from the Tooting Home, eight of Scarlet Fever, two of Diphtheria and one of Enteric Fever from the Fountain Fever Hospital, and 13 of Scarlet Fever, 12 of Diphtheria, and three of Enteric Fever from the Grove Fever Hospital; a total of 54. Small Pox. During this year the Sanitary Department have had to deal with an outbreak of Small Pox, but as the outbreak in its more intense form only commenced in the last two months of the year the complete report is necessarily postponed till next year. Particulars of the cases which were notified in 1901 are here given, and in the case of the outbreak in Streatham, a more complete report is given, as the circumstances were in many respects extremely interesting, and the experience gained very valuable. 33 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In all, 34 cases were notified (five in Clapham, one in Putney, six in Streatham, seven in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth), Of these 34 cases, five (three in Streatham and two in Wandsworth) were returned from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospital as not suffering from Small Pox, leaving 29 actual cases of Small Pox. (1)—G. K., aged 24, of Park Road, Clapham. This man was a steward on board the ss. Duke of Portland, and two cases had occurred on the ship. He came to Clapham on the 10th, •and took ill on the 12th February. No other cases occurred from this. (2 to 6)—These five cases occurred in Streatham, but two were returned as not Small Pox. The details of this outbreak are as follows: — On the 28th June I received a letter from the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Lambeth, enclosing a letter from the Medical. Officer of Health for Coventry stating that a Mrs. B. had been removed on the 25th June to the Small Pox Hospital at Coventry suffering from Small Pox, and this diagnosis was confirmed by further letter of the 28th June. The lady, Mrs. B., had been visiting at a house in Hopton Road, Streatham, and stayed there from the 5th to the 8th June, and the occupier of that house, a Mr. W., died at midnight on the 4th from what was stated on the death certificate to be nephritis and syncope. I called at the house at once and ascertained that Mr. W. had arrived from Paris on the 23rd May, where he had been living for nine weeks at the Hotel St. Petersburg. He seemed in good health till Sunday, the 2nd June, when he complained of headache, backache, and fever, and the medical man in attendance thought that he was suffering from a chill following a bicycle ride on Saturday, the 1st June. No rash was observed during life, but after death his medical man, when dressing the corpse, observed numerous haemorrhagic spots on his body, and also that decomposition was rapidly supervening. The body was buried on the 8th June, 34 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Mrs. W., on the occasion of my visit, informed me that she had been suffering from what she thought was influenza, and that she had a visitor in the house who complained of symptoms similar to her own. I advised her to send for her medical man, which she did immediately after I left. In the afternoon I received a telephone message stating that this visitor, E. W., was suffering from Small Pox, and she was removed to hospital that day. I was informed that she came to Hopton Road on the 13th June and occupied the same bed that Mrs. W. had slept on. The first symptoms of the illness appeared on the 25th. Mrs. B., who stayed at Hopton Road from the 5th to the 8th June, went to Albion Street, Hyde Park, till the 14th, then to Coventry. This fact was communicated to the Medical Officer of Health for Paddington. I was also informed that a Mrs. S. left Hopton Road on the 5 th for Farnan Road. She stayed there about nine days, then went to Rochdale, Lancashire, and from Rochdale to Mount Sorrel, near Loughborough, when she developed what was said to be malignant Chicken Pox. I at once communicated this fact to the Medical Officer of Health for Loughborough, and afterwards received a letter from the Medical Officer of Health for Leicestershire and Rutland Rural District stating that Mrs. S. was suffering from Small Pox. The inmates of the house in Hopton Road, as well as those at the house in Farnan Road, were re-vaccinated, and the necessary disinfection and cleansing was carried out under my personal supervision. I found that all the personal and bed linen from the house in Hopton Road had been sent on the 10th June to a laundry in Ferrers Road. On the 26th I was notified of a case of Diphtheria there, and on the Sanitary Inspector calling at the premises he noticed that one of the girls had some spots on her face, but as at that time he was not aware of any case of Small Pox no importance was attached to this 35 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. observation. On learning, however, that the goods from the house in Hopton Road were sent there I visited the laundry on the following day, Saturday, the 29th, and examined the workers there. I found that the girl previously seen by the Sanitary Inspector was suffering from Small Pox, and 1 at once had her removed to hospital. This girl, R. C., complained of illness on the 22nd June, 12 days after the receipt of the infected goods from Hopton Road, which she had assisted in sorting. She was seen by a doctor on Sunday, the 23rd June, and on Monday he was of opinion she was suffering from some skin eruption. She remained at home till Wednesday, the 26th June, when she went back to her work at the laundry. This last case lived in Ellora Road, Streatham, and the necessary disinfection was carried out there also. The names and addresses of all the workers in the laundry were ascertained, and they were all re-vaccinated and kept under observation for 14 days. All the goods in the laundry were disinfected, and the laundry premises disinfected and cleansed, but a large amount of linen had been sent home, and in consequence the addresses of all the persons who were customers were noted and the Public Vaccinator was given a list of these, so as to have re-vaccination of all the inmates of these houses carried out. The majority of the workers lived in Streatham, but three lived in Lonesome, Croydon Rural District, and the Medical Officer of Health for that district was communicated with as well as the Public Vaccinator. I also communicated the names and addresses of customers to the Medical Officers of Health for Paddington, the City of Westminster, Lambeth, and Battersea. On visiting the house in E.llora Road the Public Vaccinator examined W. C., aged 14 years, a brother of the girl who was removed, and as he was of opinion that the boy was suffering from Small Pox the case was removed to hospital but returned the same evening, the Medical Officer of the Asylums Board being of opinion that he was not suffering from Small Pox. 36 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On the 3rd July I was informed by the Sanitary Inspector that one girl had gone home to Myrtle Road, Commercial Road, E., on Monday, the 24th June, not feeling well. I at once telephoned to the Medical Officer of Health for Stepney, and next day received a telephone message from him to say that the girl had what was supposed to be Chicken Pox, but that she was being kept under observation. In the majority of households the linen was disinfected, but several persons refused to have it done. I instructed the Sanitary Inspector to call again at these houses and advise them to have the disinfection carried out. On Saturday, the 6th July, I visited the house in Ellora Road and saw a girl, A. R., who had slept with the girl R. C., and found that she was suffering from headache, backache, and fever. I communicated with her medical attendant, asking him to keep the patient under close observation, and on the 9th July I saw the girl again with him, and found her suffering from well marked Small Pox. This girl had been re-vaccinated along with the others, and the re-vaccination had been successful, but she had no doubt been infected on the 25th or 26th June. She was removed to hospital that day and the premises were at once thoroughly disinfected and cleansed. I also on the 9th July saw all the employes at the laundry with the exception of those residing in Mitcham, and they were all in good health, and the re-vaccination in each case was successfully performed. These employes were kept under observation till the 15th, and, as no fresh cases occurred among them, they were all allowed to return to work. The household in Ellora Road from which the case was removed on the 9th July were all successfully re-vaccinated, and this household was kept under observation till the 22nd July. 37 Report of the Medical Officcr of Health. (7)—W. H., of North Street, Wandsworth. Notified on the 27th August. This man had been in Paris from the 21st to the 24th July, and was infected there. All contacts were re-vaccinated, and no secondary cases occurred. (8)—J. G., of Wandsworth Road, Clapham. Notified on the 29th August. This man was employed at a workshop in Fitzroy Square, from which neighbourhood several cases had been removed. He infected his son (next case). (9)—T. G., notified on the 12th September. This lad was re-vaccinated the day after his father was removed to hospital, but the re-vaccination was not successful. This case was a very mild one. No other secondary cases occurred. (10)—S. G., residing in Hopton Road, Streatham. Not Small Pox. (11)—A. L., residing at Cornwall Road, Clapham. Notified on the 5th November. No history of infection could be ascertained. (12, 13, 14, and 18)—These four cases all occurred in one house in Aldis Street, Tooting. The first case reported, A. J., was infected by her brother, H. D., an unrecognised case, at first treated at home for Chicken Pox. Immediately after the removal of A. J. all other occupants of the house were re-vaccinated with the exception of No. 18, an old man of 72, notified on the 25th November, who died in hospital from Small Pox. H. D. also infected his sweetheart, who lived in Wimbledon. (15 and 16)—M. G. and F. G., residing at Rooksione Road, Tooting. Notified on the Ilth November. Infected by husband of F. G., who worked in Bermondsey, and who had an unrecognised mild attack three weeks previously. When I visited the house I examined this man and found him convalescent and free from infection. M. G., the infant aged three weeks, was unvaccinated and had a confluent attack. 38 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (17)—E. H., residing at Brocklebank Road, Wandsworth. Notified on the 25th November. This woman kept a small laundry. No history of infection could be ascertained. This patient died in hospital. (19)—M. B., of South Street, Wandsworth. Not Small Pox. (20, 21, 26, 27, 28, and 29)—These cases resided at Belvernie Grove, Wandsworth. 20 (W. H.) and 21 (H. H.) were notified on the 7th December, and were probably infected a fortnight previously at St. Bartholomew's Hospital Out-Patients' Department. W. H., an unvaccinated child, died in hospital. 26, 27, 28, and 29, living in the downstairs flat were not re-vaccinated, as No. 29, the father, refused to allow it. Four out of the five in the family were affected, while in the upstairs flat no secondary case occurred, as they were all re-vaccinated the same day that the first cases were removed to hospital. (22)—T. B., residing at Charlmont Road, Tooting. Notified on the 9th December. No history of infection could be ascertained. He had been in the city a fortnight previously. (23)—H. F., residing at Fawe Park Road, Wandsworth. Notified on the 12th December. This man came from Jubilee Chambers, Hammersmith, a few days before he sickened, and several cases of small pox had been removed from these Chambers. H. F. infected (30) W. P. and (31) H. P., living at the same address. These two refused to be re-vaccinated when H. F. was removed. (24)—H. M., residing at Garton Street, Wandsworth. Not small pox. (25)—C. D., residing at Warple Road, Putney. Notified on the 19th December. Probably infected at his place of work by a fellow workman, who lived in Battersea, and who had small pox. (32)—E. L., residing at Burntwood Lane, Wandsworth. Notified on the 27th December. This man visited the Small Pox Ships on the 13th December to see his brother-in-law, and is stated to have refused re-vaccination. 39 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. (33)—E. W., residing at Spanish Road, Wandsworth. Netified on the 27th December. No history of infection. (34)—E. B., residing at Brewery Street, Clapham. Notified on the 31st December. This man was employed by a firm who disinfect for several of the Metropolitan Boroughs, and he stated that he had been in the room where infected bedding was stored. The efficiency of prompt diagnosis and immediate re-vaccination was clearly seen in several of the above cases. In no case where re-vaccination was successfully performed was the person infected, although in some cases there were numerous contacts, while seven cases occurred in persons who definitely refused re-vaccination after exposure to infection. Of the 29 actual cases of Small Pox, three (two in Wandsworth and one in Tooting), or 17.2 per cent. died. One of the cases was unvaccinated, and the other two, ages respectively 60 and 72, had only been vaccinated in infancy. In every case, besides advising re-vaccination of all contacts, which is necessarily the first and most important line of defence, disinfection of all infected articles and fumigation and cleansing of all infected rooms were carried out by the sanitary staff under my directions. It is satisfactory to note that not one case occurred through inefficient disinfection or cleansing, and up to the date of writing this report this statement holds good. Table 21 is taken from the official returns of the Vaccination Officers to the Guardians for the year 1900. It shows the number of births, the number of children successfully vaccinated for the whole Borough, as well as for the different sub-districts Streatham, Balham, and Tooting being included under the heading of Streatham. 40 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the separate sub-districts the percentage of successfully vaccinated was as follows: Clapham 62.5, Putney 71, Streatham 63.7, and Wandsworth 74. Deducting the number of children who died unvaccinated, as well as the number postponed, insusceptible, removals, and the number of certificates of conscientious objections granted, the total number left unaccounted for amounts to 833, compared with 869 last year. This does not give any idea of the total unvaccinated children in the Borough, but if the number who died unvaccinated be added to the total vaccinated then the number who were not, but who ought to have been, vaccinated was 1,317 or 22.6 per cent. The number of certificates of conscientious objection obtained was 79, compared with 111 in 1899, and 80 in 1898. 41 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The following Table shows the number of cases of Small Pox notified in each of the Metropolitan Boroughs of London in 1901. St. Pancras, Holborn, Stepney, Bermondsey, and Westminster suffered most, while Deptford, Chelsea, Hampstead, and the City of London suffered least. The number in Wandsworth does not correspond with the number stated in the text, as two cases were notified between the 28th and 31st December. TABLE XXII.

During the year 684 cases were notified, compared with 672 in 1900, and 894 in 1899. The total number of deaths was 15, compared with 16 in 1900. 483 of the cases, or 70.6 per cent., were removed to hospital, where 13 died, and 201, or 29.4 per 42 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. cent., were treated at home, with two deaths. The case mortality in hospital was 2.19 per cent., and at home .99 per cent. The total number of deaths, 15, is one under last year, and 11.4 under the corrected decennial average. This disease was at its minimum, viz., 25, in March, rising to 74 in May, falling again to 42 in August, and reaching its maximum in November. The disease still continued to be of a very mild type, the death-rate being in 1901 .06, and in the County of London .12 per per 1,000. The proportion of notified cases per 1,000 of population was in this Borough 2.91, compared with 3.09 last year, and in the County of London 4.04. The total number of cases notified at all ages and at certain ages, and the total removed to hospital in the Borough, as well as in the separate sub-districts, is given in Table III. of the Local Government Board's Tables. In the several sub-districts the proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was as follows:—Clapham 3.6, Putney 1.6, Streatham 2.5, Tooting 3.7, and Wandsworth 3.07. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. 469 notifications were received during the year, compared with 460 in 1900, 621 in 1899, and 589 in 1898. The largest number of notifications was received from the Parish of Wandsworth, and the smallest from Putney. 367, or 78.2 per cent., of the cases were removed to hospital with 34 deaths, while 102, or 21.8 per cent., were treated at home with eight deaths. The case mortality in hospital was 9.2, and at home 7.8 ; the total case mortality being 8.9 per cent., the lowest mortality yet recorded. The case mortality for the County of London was 11.11, compared with 12.83 Per cent. last year. The maximum number of notifications was received in October, and the minimum in May. The maximum in October 43 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. was general all over the Borough, and corresponded with an increase in the whole of South London. The total number of deaths, viz., 42, is one above last year, and 43.5 below the corrected decennial average. The death-rate was .17 per 1,000, slightly under the rate for last year, but .15 under the rate for 1899; while the rate for the County of London was .29 per 1,000, compared with .335 in 1900. The number of cases notified per 1,000 population was 1.9, compared with 2.12 in 1900, while for the County of London this rate was 2.6, compared with 2.6 in 1900. In the several sub-districts the proportion of cases per 1,000 of population was as follows:—Clapham 2.1, Putney .82, Streatham 1.8, Tooting 2.8, and Wandsworth 2.3. The death-rate in the sub-districts was, Clapham .17, Putney .16, Streatham .05, Tooting .17, and Wandsworth .32. Return cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. 19 cases of Scarlet Fever and five of Diphtheria occurred after the return of a case from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals. In many of these cases of Scarlet Fever the patients had been in hospital for a considerable time and had suffered from some complication, as discharge from ear or nose. Every care is taken by the staff at the hospitals to see that children are free from infection, and it is impossible to prevent these cases altogether. The Metropolitan Asylums Board have appointed a Medical Investigator to inquire into these return cases, and a report will in all probability be made dealing with their causes and prevention. With regard to return cases of Diphtheria there were two small outbreaks traceable to these, one in Tooting, and one in Streatham, 44 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In both of these outbreaks I made personal investigation into their origin, and I was satisfied that both outbreaks were caused by return cases. In Diphtheria it is especially difficult to say in some cases when the infection has completely disappeared, and in the cases which were the causes of these outbreaks I was informed by the officials of the Metropolitan Asylums Board that cultivations had been made from the throats of the suspected patients before dismissal and the bacillus had not been found. In the outbreak in Streatham three cases occurred, with no deaths, and in Tooting eight cases, with no deaths. The cases were thus of a very mild type, and the outbreak in Tooting, which might have proved serious, was, owing to the prompt removal for the second time of the returned case, checked. The details of the outbreak in Salvador, Tooting, are as follows:— On the 7th August notifications were received that J. D. and C. D., of Salvador Row, were suffering from Diphtheria, and on the 8th August another notification was received of a case in another house in the same Row. On the 17th another case was notified, and three on the 19th. On the 19th, as I was away on my holidays, my deputy visited Salvador Row and examined several children there. One child, C. F., had a nasal discharge, and a swab was taken from the throat of this child and sent to Jenner Institute. On the 20th I visited Salvador and saw the child. As the report from the Jenner Institute had not then been received I ordered the child to be isolated from the other children in the locality. On the morning of the 21st August information was received that the Bacillus Diphtheriae had been isolated, and the child was removed that afternoon to hospital. This child, aged 4 years, had when 15 months old, according to the mother's statement, suffered from Diphtheria and had been treated for such in the Fountain Fever Hospital. 45 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. On the 28th May he was taken by his mother to the Evelina Hospital, from which he was sent to the Northern Fever Hospital the same day. He was discharged on the 3rd August, when he returned to Salvador. The mother informed me that he had a discharge from his nose, and also that she herself had a sore throat after the child's return. The mother goes out charing, and, when at work, the child was left at the house of Mrs. D., mother of the first two cases, and he also played with the other cases. There seems no doubt that C. F. infected the other cases, and no further cases occurred after his removal to hospital. Enteric Fever. 96 notifications of Enteric Fever were received during the year, compared with 153 last. 49 of the cases were removed to hospital, where seven died, and 47 were treated at home, with eight deaths. The total number of deaths was 15, compared with 26 in 1900. The number of deaths in 1901 is seven under the decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000-of population was .40, compared with .7 last year, and .70 for the whole of London. The case mortality was 15 6 per cent. for the Borough, and 15.5 for whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was .06 per 1,000, compared with .12 in 1900, and .08 in 1899. The number of deaths from Enteric Fever was lower in 1901 than it has been since the year 1892, and in comparison with the whole of London and with other localities this rate is a low one. The number of deaths in each sub-district is shown in the Tables. With reference to the causation of Enteric Fever in the Borough it has been found impossible in the majority of cases to 46 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. trace with certainty the cause of infection. In only two cases could oysters be said to have been the cause, while 11 of the cases were contracted out of the Borough, two of them in Paris. Four cases were notified from the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals in Tooting, the patients being employed as nurses there. In only eight of the cases could the sanitary condition of the premises, especially with regard to drainage, be described as bad, requiring the service of notice, but in a few of the cases there were serious complaints made of the smell from sewer ventilators in the roadway. In these latter, where such complaints were found to be well founded, the matter was reported to the Surveyor and the nuisance remedied. Puerperal Fever. 14 cases were notified, and seven, or 50 per cent., died, compared with 15 cases and four deaths in 1900. The number of deaths is 1.7 under the corrected decennial average. One of the cases occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, three in Streatham, four in Tooting, and two in Wandsworth. The death-rate was .029, compared with .017 in 1900; while for all London the death-rate was .05 per 1,000. Erysipelas. 219 notifications were received and three deaths resulted, compared with 205 notifications and nine deaths in 1900. Measles. The number of deaths from Measles during the year was 68, —16 in Clapham, two in Putney, 11 in Streatham, eight in Tooting, and 31 in Wandsworth, a decrease of 14 compared with last year, and 22.7 below the corrected decennial average. 47 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 15 of the deaths were of infants under one year of age, 50 of children from one to live years, and three from five to 15 years. This agrees with previous statistics that the most fatal age for the disease is from one to five years. The death-rate per 1,000 in the Borough was .29, compared with .37 in 1900. The death-rate in the County of London for the year was .42 per 1,000, exactly the same as in 1900. The following Table shows the number of cases of Measles and other non-notifiable diseases notified to me by the teachers of the elementary schools in the Borough. It is necessarily incomplete, as the notices were not sent at all from some of the schools, and also that it was only in the last two months of the year that information was sent by request of this Council from the Church Schools. A record will be kept in future years which will be more complete. 48 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXIII. Diseases. School. Measles. ChickenPox. Whooping Cough. Mumps.

The following schools were closed or partially closed during the year owing to outbreaks of Measles:—St. Ann's, Merton Road, Warple Way, and All Saints. In each case the classrooms were fumigated by the sanitary staff. Merton Road, Swaffield Road, and Warple Way Board Schools were closed by order of the Medical Officer to the London School Board, and All Saints and St. Ann's by order of the Sanitary Authority. Whooping Cough. 60 deaths were caused by this disease; 15 above last year, but 27.6 below the corrected average. 17 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, four in Putney, 13 in Streatham, five in Tooting, and 21 in Wandsworth. 25 of the deaths were of infants under one year of age, and 20 of children from one to five years. The death-rate per 1,000 of population was .25, compared with .20 in 1900; while for the County of London this rate was .35 compared with .42. Epidemic Influenza. Influenza was, judging from the number of deaths, much less prevalent than in the previous year, and, with the exception of the year 1896, the number was lower than in any year since 1891. 41 deaths were registered (14 in Clapham, three in Putney, 14 in Streatham, three in Tooting, and seven in Wandsworth), 46 less than last year, and 57.4 under the corrected decennial average. The death-rate was .1 per 1,ooo, compared with .4 in 1900. Diarrhoea. The total number of deaths registered as due to Diarrhoea was 146, and, with the addition of 18 to Zymotic Enteritis, 164, compared with 156 in 1900, and 195 in 1899. This number is eight above last year, and 38.7 above the corrected decennial average. 50 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths in the several sub-districts was as follows:—Clapham 42, Putney 7, Streatham 29, Tooting 29, and Wandsworth 57. The death-rate was in the Borough .69 per 1,000, compared with .72 in 1900, and with .85 for the whole of London, compared with 76. The rate for this Borough is therefore slightly under, while the rate for the whole of London is slightly above last year. In the sub-districts the death-rate from Diarrhoea and Zymotic Enteritis was, in Clapham .81, Putney .28, Streatham .39, Tooting 1.69, and Wandsworth .82. The rate for Tooting is very high, being more than double the rate for the whole of London. This high rate is largely, if not wholly, due to the improper feeding of infants, and an examination of the localities where these deaths have occurred shows that 90 per cent. of the deaths occur among the labouring classes. The death-rates in the subdistricts corroborates this, the rate being lowest in Putney, where there is a small percentage of that class, and highest in Tooting, where the percentage is greater. Again, in a large proportion of the cases the infants are hand-fed, as the mothers have to go out to work, and, in consequence, digestive troubles are the result. Of the total number of deaths 142, or 86.6 per cent., occurred among infants under one year of age. 86 of these deaths occurred in the month of August, and 27 in September, thus showing a marked relation to the temperature. The number of deaths from Enteritis was 56, making a total of 214, compared with 240 in 1900. 51 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXIV.

Bacteriological Examinations. During the year 66 Bacteriological Examinations were made, compared with 44 in 1900 and 29 in 1899. 59 of these were for the diagnosis of Diphtheria, and seven for Enteric Fever. In 32 of the examinations for Diphtheria the Bacillus Diphtheriae was isolated, and in 27 was not; while in Enteric Fever, three gave a positive and four a negative result. Non-Zymotic Diseases. The next Table shows the number of deaths from these for the year, as well as for the previous decennium for the whole Borough. The number for the years 1900 and 1901 are corrected for external and internal institutions. 52 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXV.

Cancer. A large increase is noticeable in the number of deaths from this disease, 202, compared with 147 last year. The corrected death-rate was .86 per 1,000, compared with .65 last year. The number of deaths and the death-rate in each of the sub-districts was as follows:—Clapham 54 and 1.04, Putney 20 and .82, Streatham 74 and 1.01, Tooting 10 and .58, and Wandsworth 44 and .63. Of the 202 deaths, 63 were of males and 139 of females. The death-rate of males per 1,000 living was .60, and of females 1.07. Tubercular Diseases. From diseases of the Tubercular class 388 deaths were registered, compared with 374 in 1900. 259 of these deaths occurred from Phthisis or Tubercular disease of the Lungs, 52 from Tubercular disease of the Brain, and 77 from other forms of Tubercular disease. 53 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of deaths from Tubercular diseases, and the rate per 1,000 in each of the sub-districts and in the whole Borough, is shown in the following Table:— TABLE XXVI. Sub-District. Phthisis.

This correction makes the rate comparable with the rate for all London, as shown in Table IV. From this Table it will be seen that Streatham, which includes Balham (a district which has increased rapidly within the last few years), has a lower rate from Phthisis than any of the Metropolitan Boroughs, and the same may be said of Putney. Clapham and Wandsworth are higher than the three other districts, and this is, no doubt, largely due to the greater density of the population, the density in the various sub-districts being:— Clapham 48 persons per acre. Putney 10.8 „ Streatham 25.7 „ Tooting 30.1 „ Wandsworth 27.0 „ The above does not give a true idea of the density of the population in some of the portions of the sub-districts. Take, 54 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. e.g., Fairfield Ward of the Wandsworth sub-district; the population in that Ward has a density of 43 persons per acre, as compared with 27 for the whole sub-district. The lowest death-rate from all forms of Tubercular Diseases occurred in Putney, and the highest in Wandsworth. As regards the ages at death, 188 deaths occurred between 25 and 65 from Tubercular Disease of the Lungs, and 44 from 15 to 25. At the extremes of life, the number of deaths was small. On the other hand, from other Tubercular Diseases 95 out of 129 deaths occurred under five years of age. The prevention of Tubercular Diseases has been brought more prominently to the front during the year in consequence of the Congress on Tuberculosis held in July. As a result of this Congress, there is little doubt that the public have become better informed of the fact that Consumption is an infectious and preventable disease, and that the main source of infection is in the sputum. The other outstanding feature of the Conference was the statement made by Dr. Koch that bovine and human tuberculosis were not intercommunicable. Whether this is correct or not remains to be proved, and most sanitarians will delay expressing a positive opinion as to the truth until the publication of the results of the Commission which has been appointed to deal with the question. In this Borough several thousand leaflets dealing with the prevention of Tubercular Diseases have been distributed, and in all cases of death from Phthisis a visit is made to the house, and disinfection of all clothing and bedding is offered. In a large proportion of cases this disinfection was willingly agreed to by the occupier. Instructions are also given for the room to be thoroughly cleansed, the wallpaper stripped, and the room to be thoroughly ventilated for some days after cleansing. 55 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Circulatory Diseases. This group includes not only organic and valvular diseases of the heart, but also numerous other diseases of the circulatory organs. From these 298 deaths occurred, compared with 399 in 1900. of these 298 deaths, 143 ocurred from organic disease of the heart. The greater proportion of these deaths occurred in persons over 40 years of age, and the number of deaths among males was greater than among females. Respiratory Diseases. 477 deaths were caused by the numerous diseases grouped under the above heading, compared with 577 in 1900. The greater proportion of these deaths occurred from Pneumonia. 110 of the deaths were from Acute Bronchitis, 107 from Chronic Bronchitis, 132 from Lobar Pneumonia, 172 from Broncho Pneumonia, and 11 from other diseases of the respiratory organs. Premature Birth and Developmental Diseases. From these causes 274 deaths were registered, 144 of males and 130 of females, compared with 242 in 1900. 264 of these deaths were of infants under one year of age, and 10 from Developmental Diseases between one and two years. 60 of the deaths occurred in Clapham, 22 in Putney, 80 in Streatham, 31 in Tooting, and 81 in Wandsworth. Old Age. 184 deaths were registered as due to Old Age (63 of males and 121 of females), compared with 166 in 1900. The disparity between the sexes is noticeable, and is more marked this year than in previous years. 729, or 23.29 per cent., of the total deaths occurred in persons over 65 years of age, compared with 772, or 24.2 per cent. in 1900. 57 of these deaths occurred in Clapham, 12 in Putney, 61 in Streatham, 10 in Tooting, and 44 in Wandsworth. 56 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Infantile Mortality. The total number of deaths of infants under one year of age was 816, compared with 825 in 1900. The following Table shows the number of deaths in each sub-district, the percentage to the total deaths, and the rate per 1,000 registered births, as well as the totals for the whole Borough. TABLE XXVII. Sub-District. No. of Deaths. Percentage to total Deaths Rate per 1,000 Births. Rate per 1,000 Births in 1900 Clapham 170 22.1 130 144 Putney 65 20.7 120 139 Streatham 201 23.7 123 122 Tooting 115 43.7 196 177 Wandsworth 265 28.2 129 162 Whole Borough 816 26.07 133 143 The death-rate per 1,000 births in thus lowest in Putney and highest in Tooting, the Tooting rate being much above the rate for the whole Borough. This high rate in Tooting was chiefly due to the number of deaths from Diarrhoea and Developmental Diseases, these two causes accounting for 57 out of 115, the total deaths under one year of age. The prevention of the former is a question which will always remain a difficult one, as the causes of infantile Diarrhoea are as much social as sanitary. Early marriages, employment of mothers in laundries and factories are questions with which a Sanitary Authority have no power to deal, and these, combined with ignorance and neglect, are the chief causes of digestive troubles in children. 57 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. That early marriages have something to do with this is also evidenced by the number of deaths from Developmental Diseases, and I have no doubt but that if all stillborn children were registered this would be still more evident. The general infantile rate in the Borough is only fairly satisfactory, but if the rate in Tooting had been similar to that of the other sub-districts this rate would have been fourth, instead of eighth, in the Metropolitan Boroughs. In Table 27 it will be seen that the rate for the Borough is 10 per 1,000 under last year, but that Tooting shows an increase of 19, and Streatham of one per 1,000 births, compared with 1900, the other sub-districts being lower. Inquests. The next Table shows the number of Inquests held during the year. The total number was 207, compared with 196 in 1900. Clapham shows an increase of nine, Putney of 16, Tooting of four, while Streatham shows a decrease of one, and Wandsworth of 15, compared with last year. 113, or 54.6 per cent. of the Inquests were deaths from natural causes; 69, or 33.3 per cent., from accidental causes; 19, or 9.2 per cent., from suicidal causes. In five, open verdicts were returned; and one execution took place during the year at the Wandsworth Prison. 58 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XXVIII. INQUESTS PARISHES.

Deaths in Public Institutions. In institutions situated in this Borough 403 deaths took place during the year. In Clapham 52 deaths took place: 50 in the Hostel of God, and two in the Home of the Good Shepherd. 18 were from Phthisis, six from other forms of tubercular disease, 22 from Cancer, two from Cirrhosis of Liver, and two from other causes. In the Home of the Good Shepherd one death occurred from Acute Bronchitis and one from Pneumonia. In Streatham there were 22 deaths: 17 in St. Ann's Home and five in the Middlesex County Asylum Annex. Of the 17 in St. Ann's Home, 6 were from old age, one from heart disease, four from Pneumonia, and six from all other causes. In the Asylum there were two deaths from Phthisis Pulmonalis, one from other forms of Tubercular Disease, and two from other causes. In Tooting there were 270 deaths: 207 in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, 62 in the Tooting Home, and one at the London County Council Imbecile Asylum now being erected. Of the 207 deaths in the Fever Hospitals, 91 were from Diphtheria, 60 from Scarlet Fever, 26 from Enteric Fever, 4 from Phthisis Pulmonalis, five from other Tubercular Diseases, three from Measles, two from Whooping Cough, three from Developmental Diseases, five from Pneumonia, four from all other causes, two from heart disease, and one each from Enteritis and other Septic Diseases. Of the 62 deaths in the Tooting Home, 21 were from Phthisis Pulmonalis, 11 from old age, eight from Chronic Bronchitis, 18 from all other causes, and one each from Cancer, Brain Disease, Heart Disease, and Accident. In Wandsworth there were 149 deaths: 113 in the Middlesex County Asylum, 11 in the Prison, 12 in the Workhouse, and 13 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables. In addition, there were four deaths from drowning in the River Thames. Of the 113 60 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. deaths in the Asylum, 21 were from Phthisis Pulmonalis, 22 from Old Age, four from Softening of the Brain, four from Acute Bronchitis, three from Bright's Disease, two each from other forms of Tubercular Disease, Cancer, Developmental Diseases, Meningitis, Obstruction of Bowels, and Accidents, one each from Chronic Bronchitis, and Diseases of Stomach, while 45 were from all other causes, this including the various forms of insanity. Of the 11 in the Prison, four were from Phthisis Pulmonalis, four from all other causes, and one each from Heart Disease, Bronchitis, and Accident. Of the 12 in the Workhouse, four were from Measles, four from Developmental Diseases, two from Bronchitis, and one each from Premature Birth and all other causes. Of the 13 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, three were from Heart Disease, six from all other causes, two from Cancer, and one each from Influenza, and Phthisis Pulmonalis. There are no public institutions in Putney. Of these 499 deaths in public institutions, 80 were of persons belonging to the Borough, and the great majority of the deaths, viz., 71, occurred in Tooting, either in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals or in the Tooting Home. Of these, 18 belonged to Clapham, five to Putney, 10 to Streatham, nine to Tooting, and 29 to Wandsworth. The number of deaths in outlying institutions arranged as to causes of death, and institutions in which the deaths occurred, are shown in the Table. Mortuaries. The Borough of Wandsworth lies in three Coroners' Districts. The Parish of Clapham is in the Duchy of Lancaster, Streatham in the Southern, and Wandsworth, Putney and Tooting in the South-Western Coroner's District. 61 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. It is consequently impossible, not only on this account, but also owing to the large area of the Borough, to have one Coroner's Court and Mortuary for the whole Borough. The arrangements in the past were as follows: — clapham.—The Mortuary in St. Paul's Church Yard, Coroner's Court newly built is situated close to the Mortuary. The Mortuary consists of a room for post-mortem examinations, a mortuary room, and a separate room for bodies of persons who have died of infectious diseases. The position of the Mortuary is fairly convenient, being in the centre of the most thickly populated part of the Parish. During 1901 45 bodies were removed to the Mortuary. streatham.—The Mortuary was erected in 1893 from designs by the Surveyor, and is therefore a comparatively new building. The accommodation is very satisfactory, and will prove sufficient for the needs of that portion of the Borough for many years. Inquests are held at the Streatham Hall and at other public buildings. During 1901 27 bodies were removed. Putney.—The Mortuary is situated in the Putney Cemetery, Lower Common, at the extremity of the District. The building is satisfactory, and the accommodation consists of a mortuary, post-mortem room, and infectious chamber. Inquests are held at the Parish Offices, High Street; but, as these are to be disposed of, another place will have to be found. The situation of the Mortuary is not satisfactory, as it is nearly 1½ miles from the Parish Offices. During 1901 37 bodies were removed to the Mortuary. Tooting.—The Mortuary is in Defoe Road, and is not at all satisfactory. Inquests are held in the Vestry Hall, Broadway. During 1901 19 bodies were removed to the Mortuary. 62 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Wandsworth.—The Mortuary is situated in Red Lion Street, and is not suitable or sufficient for the requirements of that part of the Borough. Inquests are held in the Town Hall, close to the Mortuary. During 1901 75 bodies were removed to the Mortuary. The Mortuary accommodation and the accommodation for holding inquests is satisfactory in Clapham and Streatham, but unsatisfactory in the other parts of the Borough. This has been recognised both by the Council of this Borough and by the London County Council, and a Conference was held between representatives of these Bodies to determine the most satisfactory method of dealing with the question in these three Parishes. At that Conference it was decided to recommend that one central Coroner's Court and Mortuary should be erected in Wandsworth for the three Parishes, and that the most suitable place was on a site adjacent to the present Town Hall. This site would be available after the carrying out of the widening in connection with the tramways. Water Supply. The water supply to the Borough is in the hands of two Companies: (1) the Southwark and Vauxhall, which supplies Putney and the greater portion of Wandsworth, the dividing line being the main line of the London & South Western Railway ; and (2) the Lambeth Company, which supplies Clapham, Streatham, Tooting, and a portion of Wandsworth. The quality of the water supplied by both Companies has been during the year, as shown in the reports of the examiners, satisfactory, and no complaints have been received at the Public Health Department with reference to the quantity except from one particular area in the Parish of Wandsworth. This area comprises several houses at the top of Allfarthing Lane, and a portion of the West Side, Wandsworth Common. There is no doubt that reasonable grounds for complaint were present, as during the summer months the supply was not constant but intermittent. There was not sufficient pressure in the mains to 63 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. keep the cisterns in these houses full, and the consequence was, that although the cisterns filled during the night, there was not a sufficient supply to last a household during the day. This fact was communicated to the Water Company, Housing of the Working Classes. The question of Housing of the Working Classes has been under the consideration of the Council during the year. The Medical Officers of Health of the sub-districts were required to report with reference to house accommodation and overcrowding, and the following are copies of these reports:— Clapham.—The Medical Officer of Health reported that there is a large working class population and the difficulty in obtaining suitable houses is considerable, such houses being rarely or never empty, and occupied almost before building is finished. During 1900, 230 single room tenements were inspected in which were living 325 adults and 70 children under 12 years of age. In nearly all instances where more than one person occupied a room they were husband and wife and child. There was no overcrowding. Such cases of overcrowding have occurred in the Parish have been easily dealt with under the Public Health Act. A great deal of old property exists in Clapham, and this has been constapdy inspected and necessary repairs executed, and much has been done to improve the ventilation, and many cases of back-to-back houses have been dealt with. Rents vary from 10s. to 17s. per week for 6 rooms, 9s. to 10s. 6d. for 4 rooms, 4s. 6d. to 12s. for 3 rooms, 4s. 6d. to 6s. for 2 rooms, 2s. 6d. to 4s. for single rooms. The greatest demand is for three-roomed tenements, and mo.i of these come between the limits of 7s. 6d. and 10s. 6d. per week. If it were possible to obtain three decent rooms for about 5s. per week it would be a great boon to the poor worker. 64 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The only improvement scheme carried out of late years has been on the Glebe Estate where a number of old and dilapidated houses have been demolished and three-storied flats built letting at 13s. 6d. per week per flat. Only a small proportion of the old inhabitants are now living in the new flats. Putney.—The Medical Officer of Health reported that there is no overcrowding. There are 28 single rooms occupied as separate dwellings. 128 cottages of 2 to 4 rooms occupied by one family. 269 „ 5 to 6 ,, one and two families. 936 „ 6 to 12 ,, two or three ,, The last two items being mostly new houses with modern improvements. The average earnings are 30s. per week, the average rents 7s. per week, the rents being from 4s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per week. There are about 50 flats or parts of houses to let. There have been no displacements of artizans under improvement schemes. The chief want is a three-roomed tenement at about 5s. per week. wandsworth.—The Medical Officer of Health reported that as far as can be ascertained from house to house inspection there is little overcrowding. In ten years about 17 cases per annum were dealt with. In 1899 and 1900 out of 2,584 houses accommodating 3,219 families, 158 or 6.5 per cent. lived in one room, 296 or 9.2 per cent. in two rooms, 979 or 30.4 per cent. in three rooms, and 1,734 or 53.9 per cent. in four rooms and upwards. Such overcrowding as there is, is due to the rent and the large families of small wage earners. The rents of houses are from 3s. per week for two rooms to 14s. per week for six rooms. The average rent 6s. 6d. to 12s., in some parts 9s. to 10s. per week. Average earnings £1 to £2. There is a great demand for houses which are let as soon as built, and except in Springfield Ward there are few if any unoccupied houses. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 65 streatham.—The Medical Officer of Health reported that there is no overcrowding. Of 104 rooms containing 217 persons, 60 are occupied each by one person, 29 families of2 persons occupy single rooms, 11 families of 3 persons occupy single rooms, 4 families of 4 persons occupy single rooms. Rents of flats average 9s. 3d., houses 12s. 6d. Average earnings: labourers 24s. to 30s. per week, artizans 35s. to 45s. There is evidence in Streatham of displacements of working men from other Districts. Tooting.—The Medical Officer of Health reported that there is no general overcrowding. The number of persons or of families occupying single rooms is 30. Of these 13 are occupied by one person each, 6 by 2 persons each, 3 by 3 persons, 6 by 4 persons, and 2 by 5 persons. Rentals: Flats 6s. and 12s., houses 6s. to 15s. The character of the poorer properties is very fair. Average earnings: 24s. to 40s. per week. There has been no displacement of working classes by improvement schemes. The Public Health Committee of the Council carefully considered these reports as well as evidence from other sources, and they reported to the Council that the Borough was at present free from overcrowding;, although it is commencing in Clapham. In November, 1901, the Committee further reported to the Council to the following effect: — REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE ON THE HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. The Committee has further considered the question of the Housing of the Working Classes in this Borough. In the former report it was stated that this Borough was fortunate at present in not showing evidence of much overcrowding, but that it might be said to be commencing in some parts, and that there was a considerable need of houses at low rents. It is probable, however, that the question of overcrowding and high rents may come upon us in the near future, and we are about to pull down considerable buildings for a widening in Clapham. As there is nothing to 66 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. prevent other bodies from building in this Borough, and as in order to make such buildings properly remunerative, sites suitable and central must be selected, it would appear to be better for this Borough to take the initiative. Representatives of the Committee have attended two Conferences of Borough Councils and the London County Council on the subject of Housing without any practical advantage, and a Sub-Committee has visited several sites and buildings, and in addition several plans and schemes have been laid before the Committee. Owing to the high price of land it appears to be impossible to build small separate houses or pairs of flats to let at lower rentals than is already done by private enterprise, and an enquiry of the Local Government Board as to the power of so dealing with good frontages as to render it possible to make such buildings remunerative under the requirements of the Act has been answered in the negative. The Council is therefore in a worse position under the Act than private enterprise. After careful enquiry, the Committee considers that the solution of the difficulty lies in the building of lodging houses or of blocks of tenements as erected by the Guinness trust. At Hammersmith, on ground costing over £6,000 per acre, the Trust has erected fire-proof dwellings containing tenements of two to four rooms each, letting at from 2s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. per tenement per week ; which rent includes the use of a laundry, hot and cold water baths, similar to the private baths at the Wandsworth Public Baths, large playgrounds of about 160 by 50 feet each, boiling water at meal times, hot and cold water at any time, a club-room, drying-rooms for clothes at a small charge, and the privilege of buying coals at cost price. We have been much struck with the completeness of detail showing a comprehension and experience of the requirements of those for whom these buildings are intended. No one earning more than 25s. per week can be admitted. The dwellings are always full, and appear to be very popular, and return 3 per cent. clear profit on the outlay. At Hammersmith on rather less than 2 acres, costing £12,ooo for the land, are blocks of tenements housing 364 families. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 67 The Committee has considered three very suitable sites in this Borough, one in Clapham, one in Wandsworth, and one in Putney, for such buildings, and recommend that the Public Health Committee be permitted to obtain a preliminary report from the Architect to the Guinness Trust as to the suitability, probable cost, &c., in order to obtain a definite estimate for dealing with these sites before deciding to recommend such buildings to the Council. J. GAY, Chairman. 7th November, 1901. The Council have presently under consideration the reports of the Architects as to sites in Rectory Grove, Clapham, and Hill's Yard, Wandsworth. General Sanitary work in 1901. In the first six months of the year the Public Health Department, as re-organised after June, did not exist, but the general sanitary work was efficiently carried out by the Inspectors in the separate sub-districts. In June the work was centralised in one office, and the re-organisation required a large amount of personal supervision and careful forethought. As this Borough .has the largest area of any in London, and as the means of direct communication in the Borough are not at present all that could be desired, it was with a feeling of some hesitation that centralisation at one head office was decided on. After a few months' trial, especially after the re-organisation and increase of the Sanitary Staff, it has been found that the work can be carried out efficiently, quickly, and conveniently from one central office. One great advantage is that I am 111 touch with the daily work of each Sanitary Inspector, and can thus closely supervise the work of the Department.. As now constituted, this Department comprises the following staff:—Nine Sanitary Inspectors, each with a separate district; one Inspector under the Sale of Food & Drugs Act for the whole Borough ; one chief clerk, two junior clerks, and an office boy. In addition there are 10 disinfectors, by whom all the disinfecting after cases of infectious diseases is performed. 68 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The Council have also agreed to appoint a Lady Sanitary Inspector for inspections under the Public Health (London) Art, and the Factory and Workshops Act. During the first six months I made in the Parish of Wands worth 76 inspections, representing 361 premises. Special inspections were also made of several localities to ascertain the condition of water supply, the provision of cisterns, and the capacity of the same. Special notice was also taken of the supply of water to waste-water preventing cisterns, and it was ascertained that in those houses with a constant water supply, or whose waste-water preventing cisterns had a head of water of over nine feet, the closets were as a rule in a much cleaner condition. This I attributed to the fact that the time of filling of these cisterns was very much less in the case of direct supply, and that consequently more efficient filling took place. This inspection was personally made for giving evidence before the Water Inquiry, but this Inquiry was not proceeded with. During the six months ending December, in the whole Borough 72 visits in connection with Small Pox, and 211 inspections respecting premises in connection with nuisances generally, were made. Special inspections were also made in the following localities White Square, with reference to the Housing of the Working Classes; Rashleigh Street, with reference to general sanitary condition; Young's Rents, Rowland's Cottages, and Charlotte Place, with reference to general sanitary condition; and Hydcthorpe Road, Scholars Road, Pentney Street, and Haverhill Road, Clapham, with reference to the prevalence of sore throats in that district, and also examining the areas under several houses to ascertain if they had been properly concreted so as to prevent dampness. As these and some of the other special inspections in Clapham and Tooting were made lo acquaint myself with the sanitary condition of parts of the district chiefly occupied by the working classes no special reports were made to the Council. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 69 In Streatham special inspections were made in Calders Row, Brixton Hill, as to general sanitary condition, and in Wellfield Road owing to several cases of Diphtheria having occurred there. In this outbreak, chiefly due to a return case, the premises were found to be unfit for human habitation, and the owner gave all the tenants notice to leave. Shortly after the houses were demolished and new buildings erected. In Tooting special inspections were made by myself of Salvador, Aldis Mews, Totterdown, Angel Court, as to general sanitary condition, and also in Salvador with reference to the outbreak of Diphtheria mentioned in this Report. Special inspections have also been made of the bakehouses, cowhouses, and slaughterhouses in the Borough for the purpose of acquainting myself with the condition under which these are carried on in the various sub-districts. More detailed inspection of the underground bakehouses will be necessary in view of the new provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, and these inspections will be carried out, as opportunity arises, during the present year. The Table of Sanitary Operations during the year does not include all the work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year, and more especially during the first half of the year. Before the re-organisation of the Department the Sanitary Inspectors carried out, besides the duties under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, other duties with reference to drains of new houses, but in future years the Table will give a more complete return of their work. When this is taken into consideration the Table compares very favourably with the amount of work done in former years. The number of houses and premises inspected shows a decrease of 3,073 compared with 1900. This decrease was general in all the sub-districts, with the exception of Tooting, where the number of premises inspected showed an increase from 522 to 1,021. 70 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. These numbers include the house-to-house inspections made, and to retain a permanent and easily accessible record of the work under this heading tables are given showing the names of streets inspected, the number of houses inspected, the number of houses in which defects were found, the percentage of defects to houses inspected, as well as the number of families living in one, two, three, and four rooms and upwards. A summary is also given showing these details for the whole Borough, and for each ward in the Borough. In column 3 where the percentage of defects to houses examined is given, it is to be noted that all defects, slight and serious, are taken into consideration, and that the highest percentage among the houses inspected during the year was in the Balham Ward. The greatest number of families living in one room was in the South Ward, Clapham. The percentage of persons living in one room to the total families among the houses inspected was as follows:—Clapham North 7.1, Clapham South 15.4, Putney I, Streatham .58, Balham 4, Tooting 1.7, Southfield 5.1, Fairfield 10.1, and Springfield 1.1. The first item in the Table of Sanitary Operations is inserted for the first time, and includes complaints made to the Sanitary Inspectors when inspecting after notification of infectious disease. The number of preliminary Notices served is under last year, this being largely due to the decrease in house-to-house inspections, but the number of statutory Notices has increased from 702 to 773. 71 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

In the first six months of the year the disinfection by steam of the bedding, &c., from infected houses in the sub-districts of Putney and Clapham was done by a contractor, while in Wandsworth, Streatham and Tooting this was done at the Disinfecting Station in Wandsworth. For the six months July to December this was done for the whole Borough in Wandsworth. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 79 The apparatus at Wandsworth has proved most efficient, and the work there has been carried out in a most satisfactory manner, but it will be necessary at no distant date to have additional apparatus and more accommodation than exists at Wands worth. During the year, in the whole Borough, 1,130 lots of bedding were disinfected : 296 in Clapham, 66 in Putney, 278 in Streatham, 85 in Tooting, and 405 in Wandsworth ; in comparison with 922 lots in the Borough in 1900. At the Wandsworth Station 1,023 lots of bedding were dealt with, comprising the following: 738 beds, 722 bolsters, 1,856 pillows, 709 mattresses, 892 palliasses, 1,543 sheets, 1,132 quilts, 776 cushions, 6,901 articles of clothing, 2,137 blankets, 1,110 carpets, and 3,956 extra articles • or. in all, 22,472 articles. 61 cases of overcrowding were dealt with during the year, the majority of these being what might be called family overcrowding, and in most cases this was remedied without requiring service of notice. 31 of the cases occurred in Wandsworth, and this was chiefly in the Fairfield Ward. 1,968 rooms were cleansed and repaired, many of these being done after infectious disease, while the remainder were done after service of notice. 694 drains were cleansed and repaired, compared with 655 in 1900. 1,572 water-closets were cleansed and repaired ; an increase of 254 compared with 1900. There will always be a certain number of these dealt with each year, as even in some of the new houses the apparatus, if not attended to occasionally, is soon put out of order if the occupiers are careless or dirty. In making a house-to-house inspection I personally saw a large number of water-closets in a foul condition in properties which had only been erected a few years. This nuisance was almost entirely due to the dirty habits of the occupiers. In a small percentage of the cases the water supply was defective, and in a very few cases there was no water at all. 80 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. The number of cases in which water supply has been laid on to water-closets was only 88, compared with 310 in 1900. The diminution in number is what might be expected, as in every instance when a water supply to a water-closet is found to be from the same cistern that supplies the drinking water notice is at once served for abatement of the nuisance. Occasional cases will be discovered from time to time, but this nuisance now will only be occasional, and not, as in former years, fairly common. 35 urinals were cleansed or repaired during the year, these urinals being principally in connection with public-houses. A general inspection of all these has been made, and, in some cases, it will only be by constant supervision that nuisances will be prevented. Public urinal accommodation in an area of the size of this Borough is a serious question, and although there exists in some parts urinals of the best construction and in most suitable localities, yet there is need for an increase of this accommodation. The district has, however, grown so rapidly, and new centres of population have risen up so quickly, that it was impossible to keep pace with the increase in providing such conveniences. 155 accumulations of manure were removed ; and 45 notices: 1 in Clapham, 29 in Streatham, 12 in Tooting, and 3 in Wandsworth, were served under the Bye-laws for the removal to be carried out even' 48 hours. The questions of manure removal and disposal are yearly becoming more serious, and the law with reference to removal must be rigidly enforced if the nuisance is to be done away with. There can be no doubt that it is becoming every year more difficult for the small tradesman to get rid of his manure regularly and in a satisfactory manner. If this is so in this Borough, which is on the outskirts of the Metropolis, it must be a much more serious question in the central districts of the Metropolis. In this Borough there are several large omnibus stables, but very few complaints have been received with regard to these, as they all belong to large companies and the removal of manure Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 81 is efficiently supervised. The Sanitary Inspectors have during the year made inspections of these premises, and only in one instance, at Totterdown Stables, Tooting, had any notice to be served for nuisance arising from the non-removal of manure. 525 dustbins were provided or repaired, compared with 729 in 1900, and 369 complaints (83 from Clapham, 68 from Putney, 90 from Streatham, 15 from Tooting, and 113 from Wandsworth) were received during the year. The great majority of these complaints were, as far as could be ascertained, trivial, and largely due to the fact that the occupants were out when the dustman called. The Surveyors under whose inspection the dusting and scavenging for the Borough is carried out have given me the following information: — In the Eastern District, comprising Clapham, Balham, Streatham, and Tooting, dust, together with that from the Southern portion of Clapham, is burnt at the Council's Destructor at Tooting. Mr. Marten, the Surveyor for the District, reported in 1900 that the Destructor was completed and working in a very satisfactory manner, also that a low-level platform and automatic feeding apparatus had been added, so that the refuse was discharged direct from the pans into the furnaces. In the Eastern District there is a weekly collection, but, at the discretion of the Surveyor, certain premises, including flats, are cleared two or three times a week. In some parts of the Borough, especially in Clapham, Balham, and Putney, as in other parts of London, residential flats are being rapidly erected, and the removal of dust from these is a question often of serious and increasing difficulty. These flats are not, in the majority of cases, occupied by the working classes, and in many no adequate provision has been made for the storage of dust for one week. In some shoots had been constructed, but they were soon found to be a source of serious nuisance, and other means had to be adopted. More frequent removal has, as already stated, been 82 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. carried out, and this mitigates the nuisance to some extent, but nothing short of daily removal will altogether cure it. In one or two instances the daily removal from each flat is carried out by the caretaker, who empties the dust into a large receptacle in the yard at the back of the premises from which it is removed by the employes of the Council. In the Western District, comprising Wandsworth, and Putney, the house refuse is collected once a week, and at the discretion of the Surveyor more frequently from flats and Public Institutions. In Wandsworth the collection and disposal is carried out by a contractor, and in Putney the collection is carried out by the employes of the Council, and the disposal by a contractor. The refuse is deposited into barges at the Parish Yards in Wandsworth and Putney, and taken down the river to some brickfields in Kent. In 496 cases the yards of premises have been repaired or paved, compared with 538 in 1900. Nuisances from unpaved yards are very common in some of the older property in the Borough, and some difficulty has been experienced in getting these yards put into a sanitary condition. In wet weather these yards have been found to be in some cases almost impassable owing to the water lying there, giving rise to dampness of walls of rooms abutting thereon. The paving of all yards a distance of three feet from the walls with impermeable material would be a benefit to the occupants of that class of property, and it is satisfactory to note that in the majority of the 496 cases dealt with during the year this was done. Smoke Nuisances. 47 cases of this were reported by the Sanitary Inspectors, and in three cases proceedings were taken. 35 of these were reported from Wandsworth, eight from Clapham, and four from Streatham. 839 unclassified nuisances were dealt with, compared with 1,476 in 1900. 83 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

Cowhouses. There are now only 18 cowhouses in the Borough (four in Clapham, three in Putney, five in Streatham, one in Tooting, and five in Wandsworth). These have all been frequently inspected during the year and the necessary cleansing done. They are all without exception kept in a satisfactory condition. One complaint was received with reference to the dirty condition of the cows in one of the cowhouses in Clapham, and this was attended to. Offensive Trades. The following is a list of the above carried 011 in the Borough. With the exception of one in the parish of Putney, they are all in the parish of Wandsworth. (1).—Harrison, Barber & Company, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth Knackers' Yard. Do. do. Bone Boilers. Do. do. Manure Manufacturers. (2).—W. C. Milestone, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth Fat Melter. (3).—Wickcns, Pease & Company, Garratt Lane, Wandsworth Bone Boilers. Do. do. Tallow Melters. (4).—Wm. Cole, Merton Road, Wandsworth Fat Melter. (5).—James Ford, Bendon Valley, Wandsworth Fat Melter. (6).—Dallett & Company, High Street, Putney Soap Boilers. Do. do. Tallow Melters. No complaints have been received during the year with respect to Nos. 1, 2, 5, and 6. In the case of No. 4, where an order was made in the end of 1900 to abate the nuisance, the premises have been under constant observation, and no escape of offensive odours of a serious nature has been observed. Very little work is now carried on at these premises, and a new building Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 85 has been erected instead of the old wooden one. No alteration has been made in the process for the destruction of the offensive effluvia, and I am still of opinion that if the same amount of work is carried on as was the case previous to action being taken, the nuisance would be as great. With reference to No. 3, complaints were made during the summer of offensive smells in Garratt Lane, Trewint Street, and Summerley Street, arising from the work carried on there, and frequent inspections of the premises were made in consequence. The means adopted for the destruction of the effluvia are, in my opinion, satisfactory, and if any nuisance arises it is from neglect on the part of some of the workmen to see that everything is working properly, and, in particular, failure to keep the fire of the boiler which destroys the effluvia at a sufficiently high temperature. The premises themselves are not kept in such a cleanly condition as they might be owing to the fact that they are undrained, and also that the yard was improperly paved, and offensive material was allowed to accumulate on the premises. The Bye-laws as to offensive trades will be more rigidly enforced in future. Slaughterhouses. These, 26 in number: nine in Clapham, three in Putney, five in Streatham, one In Tooting, and eight in Wandsworth, were frequently inspected during the year, and the necessary cleansing has been in every case carried out. No objection was made to renewals of the licences for the above. The majority of the slaughterhouses are old buildings, situated close to inhabited houses, but no complaint of nuisance has been received during the year from anyone residing in the neighbourhood. 86 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Bakehouses. The total number of bakehouses in the Borough is 153, and the following Table shows particulars with reference to these : — TABLE XXXVIII. Sub-Districts. Total. Above ground. Under ground. Semibasement. No. occupied before passing of Act, 1883.

Special inspections will require to be made of the underground bakehouses in the Borough in consequence of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Section 101 of that Act is a new one, and requires that, after the 1st January, 1904, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the District Council to be suitable for that purpose. Also by Sub-section 4, an underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the District Council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. The occupier has, however, right of appeal to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction if such certificate be refused, and such Court, if satisfied that the bakehouse is suitable, have power to grant a certificate. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. 87 Whether the Court will take into consideration the opinion of the Sanitary Authority is not stated, but it is not likely that, if the certificate is refused on reasonable grounds such Court would act in direct opposition to the decision of the Sanitary Authority. There are several bakehouses in the Borough where it will be difficult to grant certificates unless alterations, structural and otherwise, are carried out. Houses-Let-in-Lodgings. The number of Houses Let in Lodgings on the register at the end of the year was 67: 30 in Clapham, and 37 in Wandsworth. These premises are frequently inspected and the statutory cleansing has in every case been carried out at the proper time. As necessity arises other premises will be placed on the register. Milkshops. All the milkshops at present on the register have been inspected, and I have to report that they are all kept in a fairly satisfactory condition. The London County Council had 229 on their register: 48 in Clapham, 23 in Putney, 57 in Streatham, 13 in Tooting, and 88 in Wandsworth, and a list of these was forwarded on the transference of duties under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders. Since then 45 have been registered (nine in Clapham, two in Putney, 17 in Streatham, two in Tooting, and 15 in Wandsworth), or a total in the Borough on the new register of 274. Some difficulty has been experienced in regard to the registration of proprietors of small general shops as purveyors of milk in consequence of the storage at these shops not being in my opinion quite satisfactory. In several instances the registration was not completed until I was satisfied that the proprietor would carry out the instructions given as to storage and prevention of contamination. 88 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. No fault could be found with the storage in milkshops pure and simple, ample accommodation being in the large majority of cases provided. Unsound Food. During the year 39 boxes of tomatoes, 12 baskets of cherries, two trunks of fresh haddock, two boxes of soles, one box of skate, four boxes of plaice, and four bags of mussels were destroyed at the request of the owners, and certificates were given. In the majority of these cases the food was purchased by costermongers and found by them to be unsound, and brought to this Office for such certificate. Flooding of Sewers. In the parish of Clapham flooding of sewers after heavy rainfall occurred during the year, and has given rise in some eases to a nuisance of a serious nature. The streets chiefly affected were Heath Road, Silverthorne Road, Newby Street, Rashleigh Street, Milford Street, Pitcairn Street, Queen's Road, and Brandon Street. The flooding is due to the fact that the sectional area of the Heath Road sewer is not large enough to carry off the water during heavy storms. In Wandsworth flooding occurs in Garratt Lane from the same cause, and in Streatham. These main sewers are all under the London County Council, and the matter has been reported to them. Customs and Inland Revenue Act. During the year certificates of exemption from or abatement of inhabited house duty under Section 26 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act were granted in five cases. These referred to 92 separate houses. In all these cases the houses were newly built, but in two, owing to improper ashpit accommodation, the certificate was withheld until the owner had supplied each tenant with a proper dustbin. Report of the Medical Officer of Health. Factories and Workshops. The next Table shows a summary of the work done in the Borough with reference to Factories and Workshops. Owing to the re-organisation of the staff and to the outbreak of Small Pox the amount of inspections of these was not so great as it would have been. A large proportion of these workshops will be under the Lady Sanitary Inspector, and the return for next year will be more complete and the number of inspections more numerous. These numbers do not include bakehouses, each of which were inspected at least twice during the year. It is satisfactory that out of 497 workshops and 1,055 workrooms inspected during the year, in only one workroom was there any overcrowding, while eight were found to be insufficiently ventilated. During the present year all the workshops will be systematically inspected, the workrooms measured, and cards distributed to show the number of persons who may be employed therein. From my own personal inspection I am able to report that in all the workshops in the Borough visited by me the provisions of the Public Health Act, which relate to factories and workshops are complied with, and, if not, no difficulty was experienced in persuading the owners to comply with any notices served. 90 Report of the Medical Officer of Health.

During the last six months of the year the kitchens of all eating-houses and coffee-shops in the Borough have been inspected, and with few exceptions were found to be kept in a clean condition. Statement of Work under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. During the nine months ended the 31st December, 1901, 439 samples have been submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of these 58, or 13.21 per cent., were reported to be adulterated, and 10 or 2.2 per cent., were reported to be poor in quality. In 50 cases proceedings were taken against the offenders. In eight other cases the Council, after considering the circumstances, decided not to institute proceedings, and in five cases the Council decided to make no order. The total amount received from penalties under the above Acts during these nine months was £94: 5 : 0, and the costs amounted to £33: 9:0. For the three months, January to March, the total amount of penalties was £11 and the costs £3 : 17:0. Making a total for the year of £105 : 5 : 0 penalties and £37 : 6: 0 costs. 92 Report of the Medical Officer of Health. TABLE XL. Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act.

The high percentage of samples taken in Tooting was due to the number of samples (15) taken at the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. In many cases the fines inflicted were not in proportion to the offence, and sufficient publicity is not given in those cases where persons had been convicted either of a serious offence or where there had been a second or third conviction. In conclusion I am pleased to be able to report that the whole of the work of the Department was carried out by the Inspectors and the Clerical Staff to my entire satisfaction. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, P. CALDWELL SMITH. Medical Officer of Health. Appendix.

During the year 1901 the Inspector brought to the South London Central Public Laboratory 600 samples of Food and Drugs, classified as follows: — Dairy Produce 5-00 Groceries 80 Bread and Cereals 8 Alcoholic Beverages 4 Confectionery 2 Drugs 6 600 The following Table indicates the nature and number of the various articles examined and the results of their analysis: — 1. Dairy Produce. The articles entered under this head included: — Butter 251 samples. Milk 236 „ Margarine... 1 Cheese 3 ,, Lard 3 ,, Condensed Milk 6 „ 500 samples. 104 Report—Public Analyst. All these were legally genuine, exccpt the following 59, which were found to be more or less deficient: — Name of Article. Nature and Extent of impurity. Milk 71 per cent, of added water. Milk 13 Milk 13 Milk 12 „ Milk 11 ,, Milk 10 „ Milk 9 Milk 9 Milk 4 Milk 4 Milk 4 Milk 89 per cent. Cream deficient. Milk 33 ,, Milk 33 ,, Milk 29 ,, Milk 27 ,, Milk 24 ,, Milk 20 „ Milk 17,, Milk 16 „ Milk 15 ,, Milk 15 ,, Milk 14 ,, Milk 13 ,, Milk 13 ,, Milk 12 „ Milk 12 „ Milk 10 „ Milk 9 ,, Milk 8 ,, Milk 8 ,, Milk 7,, Milk 6 ,, Milk 5 ,, Milk 5 ,, 105 Report—Public A nalvst. Name of Article. Nature and Extent of Impurity Milk 5 per cent. Cream deficient. Milk 5 ,, Milk 5 ,, Butter 98 per cent. Margarine. Butter 97 ,, Butter 96 ,, Butter 95 ,, Butter 94 ,, Butter 93 ,, Butter 93 ,, Butter 93 ,, Butter 93 ,, Butter 92 ,, Butter 91 ,, Butter 91 ,, Butter 90 ,, Butter 90 ,, Butter 90 ,, Butter 90 ,, Butter 85 ,, Butter 84 ,, Butter 80 „ Butter 23.0 per cent, water. Butter 22.5 „ The above Table shows that 16.1 per cent, of the Milk samples departed from the accepted standard of purity, while in the case of Butter 8.3 per cent, of the samples were adulterated. This shows a very slight improvement in the Milk supply from 17 per cent, of impurity in 1900 to 16.1 per cent, in 1901. The Butter, on the other hand, has fallen off, the proportion of adulteration having risen from 2.94 per cent, in 1900 to 8.3 per cent, in 1901. 106 Report—Public Analyst. II. Groceries. These included: — Coffee 44 samples. Cocoa 8 ,, Tea 8 ,, Mustard 6 ,, Pepper 6 ,, Baking Powder 3 ,, Sago 2 „ Tapioca 1 ,, Golden Syrup 1 ,, Olive Oil 1 ,, 80 samples. The following nine were found to be adulterated as under: — Name of Article. Nature and Extent of Impurity. Coffee 50 per cent, of Chicory. Coffee 50 ,, Coffee 46 ,, Coffee 45 ,, Coffee 35 ,, Coffee 30 ,, Coffee 29 ,, Coffee 25 ,, Coffee 15,, This is again a falling off, as during I go I we have a percentage of 20.4, as against only 1.7 in 1900. III. Bread and Cereals. Eight samples of Flour were examined and all found genuine. Flour 8 samples. IV. Alcoholic Beverages. Four samples of Beer were submitted and all were found genuine and free from arsenic. Beer 4 samples. 107 Report—Public A nalyst. V. Confectionery. Two samples of Ice Cream were submitted, and as they were found to contain no deleterious ingredients they were therefore classed as genuine." Ice Cream 2 samples. VI. Drugs. Two samples of Eucalyptus Oil, one of Crushed Linseed, one of Gall and Opium Ointment, one of " Gregory's Powder," and one of Camphorated Oil were submitted and were found correct, except the Ointment, which contained no Opium, thus showing a falling off from 1900, when all the Drugs were found to be genuine. "Gregory's Powder" 1 sample. Camphorated Oil 1 Eucalyptus Oil 2 Crushed Linseed 1 Gall and Opium Ointment 1 6 samples. VII. Samples from the Public. During the year four samples of Butter and one of Milk were received from members of the public under the provision of the Act. Two of the Butters were adulterated with 56 and 41 per cent, of Margarine respectively, whilst the Milk contained 45 per cent, of extraneous water. In conclusion, I regret to have to observe that the Food and Drug Supply of the Borough has retrogressed in purity during the year, the general percentage of adulterated articles being 12.0 per cent., as against 7.3 in the year 1900.
