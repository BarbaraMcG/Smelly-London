To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am submitting" to the Council my eighteenth Annual Report concerning the health of the Borough of Surbiton. Owing to the intervention of the war it is intended to give only the barest facts. I drew the attention of the Council to the question of disposing of house refuse, as a fortnightly collection was undesirable, and although, as far as I know, a recommendation to revert back to a weekly one was accepted, a fortnightly collection still holds. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, NEVILLE H. LINZEE, Medical Officer of Health. 5 STATISTICS.

At the end of the year 202 persons were shown to be suffering from the disease and living within the district:— Pul. Non-Pul.

At the commencement of the year there were 187 cases of Tuberculosis on the register, and at the end of the year this figure had increased to 202. 15 During the year 4 cases were notified as recovered from the disease, 15 patients left the district and there were 29 deaths. Of the 65 new cases it is interesting to note that 33 of these were cases first notified in this district. Tuberculosis—New Cases.

These are marked chargeable to the Surbiton Corporation. 16 There is a close co-operation between the Surbiton Public Health Department and the Health Department of the Surrey County Council, the County Council making all arrangements for the provision of sanatorium and hospital treatment. The County Medical Officer of Health periodically sends Health Visitors' reports to this Department on the Home Conditions of Tuberculosis patients, and where necessary, visits are made to ascertain if overcrowding exists, and if patients could beneficially be removed to Council Houses. Measles. In accordance with the Measles and Whooping Cough Act, 1939, issued by the Minister of Health, Measles has been a notifiable disease in Surbiton since 23rd October, 1939, and accurate records of the number of cases are kept. Headmasters and Headmistresses notify the cases occurring in Schools. The Tolworth Isolation Hospital takes in complicated cases of measles. No cases were asmitted from Surbiton during the year. There were no deaths from measles during the year. Ophthalmia. Neonatorum. Ophthalmia Neonatorum is a purulent discharge from the eyes within twenty-one days of birth. All notifications of Ophthalmia Neonatorum are now sent direct to the Surrey County Council 17 by the local general practitioners, as the County Council are the authority for Maternity and Child Welfare in this district. No cases were notified during this year. Puerperal Pyrexia. Nine cases of Puerperal Pyrexia were notified during the year, seven being removed to hospital and others nursed at home. No deaths occurred. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA.

I am supplied with monthly reports by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. Drainage and Sewerage. Extensive schemes have been prepared for soil and surface water drainage in the Borough, and would in the ordinary course of events be in hand. 20 The schemes, however, have been deferred owing to the outbreak of hostilities. Swimming Baths and Pools. Publicly-owned Baths. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, Surbiton, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide with a depth of 3 to 9 feet. The water is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by injection of chlorine and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade.

During the year, twenty-eight bodies were received into the mortuary, twenty-three post mortem examinations carried out, and seventeen inquests held. The Mortuary was closed until May for alterations and modernisation. GENERAL. The work of the Department was seriously hampered in consequence of 3 Inspectors and 2 Clerks being given permission to join the Territorial Army. These men were all absent for a fortnight in the summer for training and were called to the colours in August. Difficulty was experienced in finding suitable substitutes, and I had to complete the year's work 28 with temporary clerks, and the occasional assistance, for which I was extremely grateful, of an Inspector in a neighbouring Borough. Tn addition to Civil Defence duties, which in common with other officers, have brought added work and responsibility, a careful watch has been kept on all developments arising from the war which may be prejudicial to the health of the people. Shelters, both public, private and at industrial buildings, have been regularly visited and many extra sanitary conveniences and comforts for the occupants secured. Officers responsible for other Services have been extremely helpful in this direction, and it is due to this good spirit of cooperation that no serious troubles have gone unsolved. Tn consequence of the foregoing the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, which cam© into operation on the 1st October, 1939, could not be set in motion. I am, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, geoffrey McClelland, Chief Sanitary Inspector.
