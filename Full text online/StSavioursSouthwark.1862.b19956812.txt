BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT. THE SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT. LONDON: G. HARVEY, PRINTER, 92, BLACKFRIARS ROAD. MDCCCLXIII. THE SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the St. Sabiour's district Board of Works. RESPECTFULLY PRESENTED TO THE INHABITANTS. In making their Seventh Annual Report, the Board beg to draw attention to the able analysis of the Medical Officer, the latter part of which contains tabular statements evidencing the sanitary condition of the District during the past year, and the Board are content to remark that their most careful consideration and energy continue to be directed to this, the most important of the functions devolving upon them; at the same time, they earnestly recommend a careful persual of the Medical Officers Report thereon. In consequence of the defective and uncertain supply of water for the purpose of watering the Roads, obtainable from the old pumps, more especially in Christchurch parish, the Board have made arrangements of a satisfactory nature with the Sonthwark and Vauxhall Water Company for a sufficient supply, and have provided the necessary hydrants, &c. for that purpose. Arrangements, involving, as it is thought, considerable advantages to the public property have been made with the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company where land has been required by them in the course of their operations in the District, of a nature calculated materially to improve and benefit some parts through which their line runs. 4 A new Contract for Paviers work, for the Clink and Christ- church has beenentered into with Messrs. Beevers for the supply of broken granite for the whole District, and for the Masons work in Clink and Christchurch; these Contracts are for the term of three years from March 25, 18G3 During the past year the following Annuities have dropped, viz.:—Mr. Hunt, £40 per annum; Dr. Freer, on life of Susan "Williams, £50 per annum; Mrs. Handle, £111 6s. Od. per annum; and Mrs. Naylor, £90 per annum. The Surveyors operations in a tabulated state are hereinafter set forth. 5 SURVEYOR'S REPORT, 1862 & 1863. BOROUGH DIVISION.

Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. The statistical Tables which I have the honour to place before you on the present occasion, compared with those of last var exhibit a marked improvement in the sanitary condition of the St. Saviour's District. The total deaths registered was 918. This number includes 57 cases from other parishes, which terminated fatally in the Hospitals, and gives a decrease of 148 in the mortality of the past year. The annual death rate since this Board was first constituted has been respectively 868, 920, 1047, 996, 929, 1066 and 918. The number of deaths registered in the year 1862 being, with one exception, lower than on any previous occasion. The rate of mortality in the whole of London during the past year was 2.349 per cent.,— in the South 2.261, and in the St. Saviour's District 2.396. The highest mortality prevailed in the East and Central Districts where it was respectively 2.592 and 2.578. The mortality in the St. Saviour's District, therefore, very nearly corresponds with the aggregate, and is a little higher than that of the South Districts as a whole, which, as the Registrar General justly observes, "have achieved for themselves a marked improvement." These general results will be readily deduced from the tables now in your possession; but as the condition and circumstances of the District have lately been, and still are somewhat exceptional, I shall, with a view of affording a more just and minute estimate of our actual position than can be obtained by a mere comparison of figures, offer a few observations by way of elucidation. It will be observed that although there was last year a decrease of 148 in the number of deaths from all causes, there was an increase of 10 in the mortality from Epidemic diseases. This arises principally from an alteration in the classification. For the purpose of more exact comparison with the published Reports of the Registrar General I have this year introduced a column for Diphtheria under the head of Epidemics. In former years these deaths were classed under the general head of other causes. As there were 9 deaths from Diphtheria during the past year this would reduce the difference to 1. Measles, Hooping cough and Typhus were considerably more fatal than in the preceding year; Scarlatina and Diarrhoea less so. In 1861 there were 12 deaths from Measles and 72 from Scarlatina. Last year there were 36 deaths from Measles, and only 31 from Scarlatina. It does not however appear that this higher mortality from Epidemic is disproportionate to the other Districts of the Metropolis. In estimating the decrease in the number of deaths it must be remembered that thepopulation of the District is probably smaller 9 now than at the date of the last census. I put this hypothetically, because it is by no means certain that such is actually the case; and certainly not to the extent which is generally supposed. At the date of the last census a large number of houses, which have since been pulled down, were untenanted, and it is unquestionable that the depopulation of the District has not been proportionate to the demolition of the dwellings—especially of the poorer classes. To meet tho demand for house accommodation every available apartment has been let and occupied, and in many instances two or more families are found occupying the same room. The opinion that the population has not diminished to any great extent is further supported by the fact that in the year 1861 the excess of births over deaths was 256, while in 1862 it amounted to 309— that is to say the births have diminished by about 1-13, and the deaths by about 1-6. Thus it appears that the decrease in the number of deaths is more than double the decrease in the number of births, and this is an unquestionable test of health and general prosperity. Another interesting indication of the satisfactory sanitary condition of the District is furnished by a comparison of the ages of those who died last year, with those of the year preceding. During last year there was a decrease of 128 deaths of persons under 20 years of age; and a total decrease of 168 of persons under 60 years of age. In the same period there was an increase of 20 persons who died between the ages of 60 and 100. The records of the District Registrars supply some interesting instances of longevity. One person died at the advanced age of 100 years, having been born a fortnight before King George IV. Of the remaining 24 who lived to the age of 80 and upwards 5 were nonagenarians, and of those whose ages range from 60 to 80 the majority had passed the age of 70 years. In assuming the death rate to be a sound basis upon which to estimate the health of a District, it would be unfair to leave out of consideration differences of locality. St. Saviour's, being a water side District, registers more deaths from accidental causes than others not so situated. During the past year as many as 10 persons were found drowned and brought into the District for the Coroner's Inquisition. This circumstance legitimately affects any calculation or comparison of numbers. Of 44 persons whose deaths were due to accident or violence, 16 children were burnt to death, thus it is to be feared in too many instances affording a melancholy proof of the want of prudence and foresight, if not of positive and criminal parental neglect. Small pox was fatal in two cases. This low mortality would appear to call for no other observation than an expression of thankfulness that a disease so loathsome should be so rare a visitant. Although it may be considered somewhat irregular, in a Report for last year to anticipate the results of the present, yet as it is 10 notorious that Small pox is now more prevalent in London than it has been for many years, it appears desirable to take this opportunity of offering a word of warning and advice. It is incontestable that we possess a safe-guard against its virulance, if not against its approach. The history of the disease clearly demonstrates that vaccination operates as a preventive; and even when it proves inadequate to ward off the disease, it assumes a mild and modified form, and death seldom ensues. On a former occasion I directed attention to the conclusive fact that the statistics of the Small pox Hospital for ten years prove that, of vaccinated persons, only 7 per cent. die, while of those not vaccinated the per centage of deaths is 36. Indeed it has been suggested, by those who have had considerable experience in the matter, that if the operation were more effectually and carefully performed than has frequently been the case, this death rate would be still lower. These facta should be sufficient to disarm prejudice and waken parents and others to a sense of their responsibility; and it is most earnestly to be desired that all who read these pages will avail themselves of the facilities now offered, and take advantage of this salutary safeguard in all cases where vaccination has not been performed. From a careful consideration of the statistics of mortality in connection with the peculiar circumstances of the District, the following gratifying results are obtained. The rate of mortality has not been perceptibly higher than the rest of London, and much lower than some Districts. There was an aggregate decrease of 148 deaths from all causes, which was at least only partially due to a diminished population. The deaths from Epidemics was only one in excess of the previous year. From Phthisis and diseases of the respiratory organs there was a diminution of 57. A large proportion of the deaths registered resulted from senile decay, and consequently a much smaller number died from among the young. There were 309 more births than deaths. Considering the crowded state of the locality in connection with these facts, it should excite gratitude as well as surprise that disease and death have been sparing of their visitations. It is necessary again to repeat that very little can be done by public Boards and their officers without co-operation. Poverty, dirt, intemperance, and disease too frequently go hand in hand. The advantages of cleanliness and ventilation are almost universally ignored by the lower classes. The ignorance of the poor on such points, is only exceeded by the ignorance of the wealthy as to their actual condition. We should therefore leaven our blame with pity, and frequently excuse where we are tempted to accuse. Use, it has been truly said, is second nature, and small ill ventilated filthy rooms are not so obnoxious to those who have been reared in them, as to higher classes, who have been accustomed to the comforts of a well ordered home. In the execution of public, and perhaps necessary works in this District, the poor have been put to great inconvenience, and in many cases harshly treated, and it is to be hoped as they advance towards completion, healthier 11 commodation may be provided for the class of persons of which this District to so large an extent consists. Many of the most dilapidated houses have been demolished, but the effect of the change has been a closer crowding in those that remain, and to say that there are at least 5000 persons resident amongst us who live and sleep in rooms which afford leas than 250 feet of air to each person would not be far from a correct estimate. The evil is acknowledged, but the remedy is not easy. Many of the poor arc actuated by a spirit of independence and suspicion of interference, which renders auy attempt to improve their social and sanitary condition, not only disagreeable but impossible. Time will doubtless work a favourable change. Very shortly the new street will be opened, the main drainage complete, the Thames purified, and the two railways in operation. Vacant spaces will be occupied by more commodious dwellings; frequent and easy opportunities afforded for cheap rural excursions, and the temporary inconveniences necessarily caused by the change through which the District is passing, will be more than compensated by greater general prosperity, and the adoption of healthier recreation. I have appended a Table of inspections, and sanitary work done in the District, in which your Inspector of Nuisances has participated with his accustomed intelligence and activity. During the past year a largo share of attention was given to a manufactory for the distillation of Petroleum, in Suffolk-grove. In consequence of numerous complaints, I considered it my duty to make several visits and enquiries on the subject in the surrounding neighbourhood, and 1 found that the hvdrocarbons of which Petroleum is composed were so volatile that they penetrated the recesses of adjacent dwellings, and even tainted the food of the occupiers. It could not therefore cause surprise that persons residing in the immediate vicinity should have been subject to irritation of the throat, nausea and violent retching; coughand a peculiar prostration of strength. These symptoms were complained of by almost all whom I visited. The Proprietor was consequently summoned before the Police Magistrate in the month of September last. A fine was inflicted and an order made to abate the nuisance. After some litle delay this was done. Subsequently an application was made to the Metropolitan Board for a license to store Petroleum in the premises in question, which was successfully opposed by the officers of this Board, and the license refused. The application was repeated, with a similar result. I have at certain intervals Bince then visited the locality and, notwithstanding several attempts to prove the nuisance still to exist, I am satisfied that there is none of which any inhabitant has substantial grounds to complain. in this opinion I am fortified by the testimony of your Inspector of Nuisances, and the Health Officers of the parish of St. George the Martyr, to whose District Suffolk-grove is contiguous. In conclusion, I beg to acknowledge the courtesy and consideration I have invariably received from this Board, and all its Officers, and beg to remain, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHT. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH.—Population at Census, 1861, 17,030.
