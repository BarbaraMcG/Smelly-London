After full consideration and consultation with the Rector, the Vestry resolved— 1 st. That it is expedient to continue the office of Clerk in Orders. 2nd. That the appointment he made subject to the following conditions, viz.:— (1) The persons entitled to appoint or elect the Qlerh in Orders of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, are the Vestrymen of the said Parish in Vestry assembled, proceeding on the nomination of the Rector, and appointing a person nominated by such Rector.

South-Western District Post Office of London Extension Scheme. A Parliamentary plan and notice were deposited in November 1879, on behalf of Her Majesty's PostmasterGeneral, of an intended application to Parliament for an Act to empower him to take land, &c., to extend the Southwestern District Post Office at Buckingham Gate. The plan showing that power was to be taken to extend the Post Office over a portion of the public way in Stafford Place. The Vestry petitioned Parliament against the Bill, which was subsequently introduced into the House of Commons, on the ground that the proposed encroachment on the public way was objectionable in principle, and detrimental to the interests of the public. The Post Office authorities then communicated with the Yestry, stating that, under the powers proposed to be obtained by the Bill, the building frontage to the footway, between Stafford Place and Buckingham Palace Road, will be set back, thus increasing 38 the width of the footway; and that no enclosure of any part of the road or footway was contemplated; and further that the Post Office Department was prepared to modify Clause 7, as shown in manuscript in a printed copy of the Bill accompanying the letter. This alteration of the Clause, having met the objection of the Vestry, was introduced into the Bill, and thereupon the Vestry withdrew their opposition to the scheme. Bars and Gates across Public Thoroughfares. The Vestry of the Parish of St. Pancras having asked the Vestry of this Parish to join a deputation to the Metropolitan Board of Works, in support of a Memorial praying the Board to promote a Bill, in the next Session of Parliament, for the removal of all gates and bars from the streets and thoroughfares of the Metropolis, and for preventing the erection of similar obstructions in future, where the cost of paving, lighting, cleansing, maintaining, and sewering such streets and thoroughfares is defrayed out of the rates, the Vestry appointed four gentlemen to join the deputation. The Memorial was submitted, but the Board, after considering the same, subsequently wrote, stating that they had come to the conclusion that it was not expedient at that time, to take any further action with reference to the subject. Banking Account of the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry, during the year, again wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer reminding him of his having promised the Deputation of Vestry who waited upon him last year (11th March, 1879), that he would consult the Law Officers of the Crown as to the competency of the Metropolitan 39 Board of Works, to keep their accounts at any Bankers other than the Bank of England, and respectfully asking him to communicate to the Vestry such opinion; the Vestry also drew attention to the fact that the present Bankers of the Board had recently adopted limited liability. In reply to this communication a letter was received from the Treasury stating— "That the Lords of Her Majesty's Treasury are advised that the power of the Treasury under the 41st section of the 'Metropolitan Board of Works Loans Act, 1869,' is to approve of the appointment by the Board of Works of a Bank. This approval of the Treasury having been once given cannot be afterwards revoked, but would be again exercisable if the Board of Works wished to make a fresh appointment of a Bank under the 41st section of the above quoted Act." The Yestry again urged their views on the Treasury, but no satisfactory reply has been received. List of the Duties of the Medical Officer of Health, Inspector of Nuisances, Gas Inspector, Assistant Surveyor, Wharf Clerk, Horse Keeper, Wharf Foreman (Belgrave Wharf), Clerk of the Works (In-Wards), and Yard Foreman (In-Wards), having been drawn out by the Yestry and printed, are to be found in Appendix No. 9, together with a List of the duties of the Lamplighters. During the year 24 communications have been received from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works, notifying the applications made for the consent of the Board to the erection of porticoes, bay windows, additions, or other alterations to property within the line of area in this Parish. A list of these 40 tions, with the opinion of the Yestry, and the decision of the Metropolitan Board of Works upon each application is submitted in Appendix No. 10. Fifty-nine applications for permission to build or alter vaults, areas, dung pits, and for other works, abutting upon or under the public way, have been considered by the Yestry. A list of the various applications, with the decision of the Vestry, is printed in Appendix No. 11. Alterations in Names of Streets, and Renumbering of Houses. Orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works were received during the year, making alterations as under:— Stanley Street, Pimlico, renamed Alderley Street. Upper Eccleston Street renamed Belgrave Place. Arabella Row incorporated with Lower Grosvenor Place, houses renumbered. Cottage Road—houses renumbered. Shepherd's Court, Upper Brook Street, renamed Shepherd's Place, and houses renumbered. 41 LIST OF CHARITIES. Lyon's Estate Charity. The Vestry are interested, so far as the portion of the roadway of Oxford-street in this Parish is concerned, in the rents and profits of certain lands at Kilburn and St. Marylebone, which were left, about the year 1592, by John Lyon, the founder of Harrow School, towards the repair of the road, from Edgware to London, and the road, from Harrow to London. These rents and profits are paid annually to the Edgware Highway Board, by the Keeper and Governor of Harrow School, and by that Board distributed amongst the various local authorities having jurisdiction over the roads. The total sum apportioned to the southern half of Oxford-street for the year ended 31st December, 1879, was £250 4s. 6d.

This Parish, together with the Parishes of St. Martinin-the-Fields, St. Clement Danes, St. James, Westminster, and St. Paul, Covent Garden, are interested in this Charity, which was founded by Earl Craven, in 1687. The Charity, in 1868, consisted of property at Craven-hill-gardens, Cravenhill-mews, and Craven-mews, let at rents realizing £183 14s. per annum; and £15,537 cash, being the purchase-money due for premises belonging to the Charity, taken for the purposes of the Metropolitan Railway Company; and £395 7s. 8d. Bank 3 per Cent. Annuities, remaining on the credit of " Attorney-General v. Earl Craven." The Charity was originally demised by the Earl Craven, for the benefit of poor persons suffering from the plague. A scheme for the management and regulation of the Charity, and for the application of the income thereof, was approved by orders of the Court of Chancery, on 30th May, 1864, and 19th February, 1868. Under this Scheme, the Incumbents of each of the Parishes interested, are by virtue of their offices, always to be Trustees. In addition to which, Trustees have been appointed by the Charity Commissioners for England and Wales, upon the nominations of the several Vestries, in the following proportions, viz.:— St. Martin-in-the-Fields 2 St. George, Hanover-square 2 St. Clement Danes. 4 St. James, Westminster 4 St. Paul, Covent Garden 4 46 One of the appointed Trustees from each Parish is to go out of office every fourth your, but shall bo eligible for reelection. The duties of the Trustees, Receiver, and Clerk are laid down in the Scheme, and the application of the income is as follows, viz.:— " After providing for any costs or expenses which may from time to time bo directed by any Court or authority of competent jurisdiction to bo paid out of the funds of the Charity, and paying the current expenses of the management and administration of the trust, in pursuance of this Scheme, the Trustees shall, until the further order or direction of the Court of Chancery, from time to time pay three-fifth parts (not exceeding £600) of the not annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of King's College Hospital in Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and the remaining two-fifth parts (not exceeding £400) of such not annual income to the Treasurers or other the persons for the time being acting in the administration of the funds of Charingcross Hospital in Agar-street, Strand, such payments to be received by the said Hospitals respectively on the conditions hereinafter mentioned:— "I. The Governor's of King's College Hospital shall sot apart twenty-four beds, and the Govornors of Charing-oross Hospital shall set apart sixteen beds, in a Convenient part or parts of their respective Hospitals, and shall receive therein such patients (herein called in-patients), being sick and otherwise qualified according to the provisions hereof, as shall be sent by the Trustees with in-patients' orders as hereinafter provided. " II. The said Governors respectively shall also receive 47 and supply with advice and medicine as outpatients all poor persons resident in the said several Parishes who shall be sent by the Trustees with out-patients' orders at the customary times for the attendance of out-patients. " III. The Secretaries of the said Hospitals respectively shall give immediate notice to the Clerk of all vacancies in the number of the in-patients, and of any person being rejected as an inpatient. " IV. All in-patients requiring medical or surgical aid, and being fit cases for Hospital treatment, shall be received by both Hospitals indiscriminately, whether suffering from contagious or infectious disorders or not (small-pox alone being excepted), and shall be treated in all respects in the same manner as the other patients received into the Hospitals respectively." The orders for admission as in-patients or for treatment as out-patients in the Hospitals, are granted by an Order Committee, consisting of five Trustees, one member of the Committee being elected from each Parish interested. A new Scheme is to be obtained, if by the falling in of leases or otherwise the net income of the Charity shall exceed £1,000, or if at any time, from change of circumstances or otherwise, Her Majesty's Attorney-General should be of opinion that further arrangements are desirable. Samaritan Fund. In the year 1862 the sum of £50 was left by Lady Williams to the poor of this Parish. The sum having been 48 handed to the Clerk of the Governors and Directors of the Poor, they, under the authority of the 13th section of "The Parish Local Act" (7 Geo. IV., cap. cxxi.), on the 21st May, 1862, resolved:— " That a hook bo provided, called the Samaritan Fund Book, in which the amount should be entered; that the money bo kept in the Clerk's hands, and disposed of, from time to time, by this Board, the sums given being signed by the presiding Chairman of the day." Subsequently the Board further resolved:— " That a box bo placed at the House in Mount-street, with the following inscription,— Samaritan Fund of St. George, Hanover-square, for the Relief, by Gift, of such Poor Persons as the Poor Board cannot, by law, assist with Money;' and " That the Governors and Directors of the Poor, for the time being, constitute a Committee for the distribution of the Samaritan Fund." Upon the formation of St. George's Union, the Fund was handed over to Trustees, for the benefit of the poor of this Parish. The box is retained at the Mount-street Workhouse, and the funds arising therefrom are distributed by the Trustees, upon the recommendations of the Board of Guardians of St. George's Union.

My Lords and Gentlemen, I beg to submit this my Sixth Annual Report of the various Works which have been carried out during the year ended Lady-day 1880 ; also a Statement showing the actual cost incurred in each department. Maintenance of Roads. The following thoroughfares have been converted from flint roads to granite roads :— Vauxhall Bridge Road (from Victoria Street to Upper Tachbrook Street). Sutherland Street. Winchester Street. The following statement shows the quantity of material used in the maintenance and repairs of the various roads in the Parish, and the total amount expended, including labour:— Granite. Tons. Flints. Tons. Actual Cost. £ S. d. South Belgravia . 1,159 1,319 1,832 16 0 Grosvenor Place District 4,494 567 6,714 14 5 In-Wards . 4,251 — 4,785 18 10 9,904 1,886 13,333 9 3 The Steam Roller. The steam roller has worked continuously on the granite roads, and occasionally on flint roads. The horse roller has also been used on flint roads as often as circumstances would permit. 56 The cost of maintaining the steam roller, including all expenses of every description, has been as follows :— March 25th, 1880. £ s. d. Wages 170 4 2½ Cartage of Water . 143 19 0 Oil, Tallow, Waste, &c. 19 10 5 Coke 69 19 10 Coals (estimated) . 6 0 0 Firewood 2 10 6 Repairs by Messrs. Aveling and Porter 140 8 4 Small Repairs by Engine Driver 14 10 10½ Sundries 13 7 6 Depreciation, 10 per cent. 51 0 0 £631 10 8 The total area of streets rolled has been about 413,812 superficial yards, a portion of which has been done by hired rollers. The cost of hiring during the year has been £33 14s. Wood Pavement. In addition to the various works allowed for in my estimate for the year, the Vestry, at its meeting hold on the 23rd January, 1879, decided to pave with wood the roadways of Bond Street (from Piccadilly to Oxford Street) and the portion of St. James's Street under the jurisdiction of the Parish; subsequently, the Vestry also decided to pave portions of the roadways of George Street, Maddox Street, and Mill Street, around St. George's Church; also a portion of Stafford Street, from Albemarle Street to Bond Street. The total cost of these works amounted to 57 £6,716 15s. 9d. With the exception of Stafford Street, of which the Vestry only paid half the cost, the expense incurred in paving these streets was paid for out of the General Rate, there being, it was anticipated, a sufficient surplus amount in hand to meet this expenditure. The works were let by public tender, and were carried out by the Improved Wood Pavement Company, for the sum of lis. per yard, including digging and carting away the old macadam roadways and laying down 6 inch deal blocks on 6 inches of the best Portland cement concrete. In the case of St. James's Street, which was previously paved with stone, the price was only 9s. 3d. per yard super, the Vestry taking up and carting away the old paving stones at its own cost. The conditions upon which the contract for the paving of Bond Street and St. James's Street was based, are shortly as follows :—The Company agreed to maintain the roadways for the term of three years after completion, free of all expense to the Vestry, and to maintain them for a further term of twelve years in consideration of an annual payment of 8d. a yard super in respect of Bond Street, and 9d. a yard super in respect of St. James's Street, the Vestry agreeing to pay £80 per cent. of the total first cost on completion of the works, £10 per cent, three months after, and the balance of £10 per cent. at the expiration of three years from the date of completion, provided always that the pavement be in good and satisfactory condition. It is, I think, only fair to add that the whole of the work comprised in the contract was carried out within the specified time, and in a creditable and thoroughly satisfactory manner. The following statement shows the situation, area, and description of Wood Pavement laid throughout the Parish up to Lady-day 1880. 58 Statement showing the situation, area, and description, of Wood Pavement laid throughout the Parish, up to the Tear ended Lady-Day 1880.

Carriageways (Stone Paying). Owing to the quantity of old Granite pitching, or paving stones, removed from St. James's Street in consequence of the substitution of Wood pavement, the Vestry decided to utilize the stone by paving portions of the following roadways : Buckingham Palace Road, opposite the Shakespeare Hotel, from the north entrance of Yictoria Station to Stockbridge Terrace; Wilton Road, from the east entrance of Yictoria Station to Yictoria Street, and at junction of Yauxhall Bridge Road and Stockbridge Terrace: the area paved is about 3,500 yards. The work was done by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., and the total cost (exclusive of the value of the stone) was £1,828 19s 5d. Refuges. A letter, dated August 8th, 1879, was received from Mr. Lushington on behalf of Mr. Secretary Cross of the Home Office, suggesting that additional Refuges for foot passengers should be provided in this Parish at the following spots :— Buckingham Palace Road, between the end of Stockbridge Terrace and Belgrave Mansions; Yictoria Street, west end, . between the London and County Bank and the " Standard" Public-house. The Vestry having considered the matter and concurred in the suggestion of the Home Secretary, ordered Refuges to be fixed at the spots indicated, and also at several other important positions where they were considered necessary, viz.:— 61 Out-Wards. Wilton Road, opposite " Windsor Castle " Public-house. Buckingham Palace Road, opposite Grosvenor Hotel. Grosvenor Gardens, at intersection of Grosvenor Place and Grosvenor Gardens. Grosvenor Place, opposite entrance to Constitution Hill. Lower Grosvenor Place, in line with Grosvenor Place. Lower Grosvenor Place, in line with Buckingham Palace Road. Belgrave Road, junction of Denbigh Street. The lamp columns and guard posts have been made and supplied by Messrs. Young & Co., of Eccleston Iron Works, from patterns specially designed for this Parish, and which are the exclusive property of the Vestry. Maintenance oe Footways. Asphalte Footways. The gravelled footways on the north and south side of the Grosvenor Road, abutting on the River Thames, have been paved by the Val-de-Travers Asphalte Company with their compressed Asphalte. The former at the cost of the respective owners of property ; the latter at the expense of the Parish. Mastic Asphalte also has been laid by the same Company over landings in Wilton Road (round the "Windsor Castle" Public-house), Vauxhall Bridge Road, Chesham Place, and other places. Repairs to Footways. There have been constantly employed during the last year, in the various repairs, &c., four masons and four paviors; they have re-laid certain portions of the foot and carriageways which were worn, sunk, or broken, using new 62 materials, supplied by contract, where the old was not fit to relay; they have also made good the pavements disturbed for gas, water, new buildings, alterations, &c. They have used, during the year, 1,418 yards super, of York paving, and the cost has been as follows:— £ s. d.

During the past winter, the Gas Sub-Committee have had under consideration the question of improved street lighting, with special reference to Street Refuges. The Committee have had several special meetings, many of which were held at night, on which occasions the Committee perambulated the streets of this and other Parishes in London, with a view of seeing the various methods of street lighting. The Committee visited, amongst other places, Waterloo Bridge, and inspected that thoroughfare as lighted with Sugg's Improved Argand Burners, of various standards of illuminating power from 30 to 100 candles. The Committee also carefully watched, from time to time, and were much interested in the lighting of the Thames Embankment by the Joblockhoff system of Electric Light. Arrangements were made with the officials of this Company to visit the engine house and works under Charing Cross Bridge, so as to acquire a knowledge of the details connected with the working of the system. On the appointed evening the Committee were met on the ground by Sir James Hogg, Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Mr. Lovick, Engineer to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Chief Engineers of the Company, who gave the Committee every information. The Committee examined the engines and other works, and witnessed the process of lighting. Street Refuges. With tho view of adopting some improved Lantern for the better means of lighting up the Street Refuges throughout the Parish, the Committee have made extensive experiments with almost every description of Street Lantern known to them. After the most exhaustive 65 enquiries and trials the Committee ultimately approved of and adopted " Bray's Patent Street lantern, and flat-flamed burner," it being, in their opinion, the best, and most suitable to meet all the necessary requirements. These lamps have been universally adopted throughout this Parish. Upon each Refuge one of these Lanterns is fixed, with an illuminating power varying from 30 to 100 candles, according to the importance of its position. The amount of gas consumed varies from 12 feet to 50 feet an hour, according to the size of the Lantern. The purchase of these Lanterns, and the increase in the consumption of gas, will, necessarily, add a little to the cost of the lighting, but the benefit to the ratepayers and general public, by the greater safety afforded them in the well lighting up of these otherwise dangerous places, will, it is hoped, amply compensate far the extra expenditure. The streets under the control of the Vestry have been lighted by gas supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company and the London Gas Company. The lighting of the public lamps in the portions of the Parish supplied with gas by the Gas Light and Coke Company has, since the 25th June, 1877, been lighted upon the average meter system; the Vestry carrying out the work of lighting, cleansing, and repairs by its own staff of lamplighters and other workmen, and the gas being paid for by meter indication. The portion of the Parish known as the Grosvenor Place District is supplied with gas by the London Gas Company at a contract price of £3 9s. per lamp per annum, including lighting, cleansing, and repairs. The following statement shows the cost of lighting that portion of the Parish, carried out by the meter system :— e 66 Cost of Lighting the Public Lamps by the Average Meter System for the Twelve Months ended June 1880:— Gas Light and Coke Company.

The cleansing of the streets has been done by men in the employment of the Vestry. The sweepings in the In- 67 Wards have been removed under contract by Messrs. Mead and Co.; the sweepings in the Out-Wards have been carted from the streets by the Parish carts to the Parish Wharf, and thence barged away by contract. With the view of preventing disagreeable smells which were complained of, the principal thoroughfares have, as occasion required, been thoroughly washed, and the effect has proved most beneficial. Watering the Streets. The spreading of the water in the streets of the InWards has been done by Messrs. Mead & Co. ; in the OutWards by the horses and carts belonging to the Vestry. The water for the In-Wards is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Company, and that in the Out-Wards by the Chelsea Water Company. Stock of Plant and Materials. The valuation of the plant and materials, consisting of 1 steam roller, 1 horse roller, 28 horses, 20 slop carts, 10 new patent slop carts, 8 water carts, 16 water vans, 7 shoot carts, gas apparatus, meters, &c., the property of the Vestry, at the expiration of the parochial year, was £8,298 4s. 11d (as per Stock Book). On the 25th of March, 1879, the number of horses in stock, the property of the Parish, was twenty-seven. Since then two horses have been sold by auction, and one destroyed, and have realized £69 8s. 2d. Four horses have been purchased, at a cost of £320 5s. The number of horses in stock, therefore, at the end of the past year (Ladyday 1880) was twenty-eight; the value of which I estimate at £2,186. 68 Stable Arrangements. The cost incurred, under this heading, in the maintenance of the Parish Plant, together with the keep of the above horses, including all labour and expenses for the year ended Lady-day 1880, has been £4,454 18s.7½d., viz.:— Particulars. £ s. d.

Sewers. Serious accidents to the workmen employed in cleansing the sewers having resulted from the accumulation of foul gas therein, the Committee of Works instructed me to report upon the matter, with a view of suggesting some remedial means to prevent such accidents in future. In my Report to the Committee, of the 13th November, 1878, I suggested the use of " Davy lamps," instead of the ordinary open lamps; the Committee having approved of the suggestion, these lamps are now used by all men employed in sewer work throughout the Parish. 70 Summary of the Expenditure for General Works, Year ended March 25th, 1880.

CORFIELD, M.A., M.D. (Oxon.), F.R.C.P. (Lond.), Professor of Hygiene and Public Health in University College, London, medical officer of health (being his eighth annual report). Co the Vestry of the Parish of St. George, HANOVER SQUARE. My Lords and Gentlemen, In the year 1879, ending on January 3rd, 1880, 53 weeks are included, and this must be remembered in comparing the figures representing the totals with those of previous years, although the rates are, as was the case in 1874 (also a year of 53 weeks), corrected to represent 52 weeks, and therefore are comparable directly with those of other years. The year has been a healthy one, the death-rate being well below the average, although, for a reason which will appear later on, it is a little higher than during 1877 and 1878, being almost exactly the same as in 1876. The gross total of deaths during the 53 weeks was 2,058, a larger number than in any one of the previous ten years; 73 but this was chiefly due to the exceptionally large number of persons who died in the Public Institutions in the Parish, viz., 759,—our share of such deaths being only 402. I estimate the population of the Parish, in the middle of the year, at 91,447, which is to the estimated population of London about as 1 to 393/5. Table I. YEAR. Gross Total of Deaths. Deaths in Public Institutions. Proportional Share of Deaths in Public Institutions. Corrected Total of Deaths (52 weeks).

This is equivalent to a death.rate of 18.25 per thousand per annum, a trifle higher than that of last year, but over 0.5 per thousand lower than the rate for the last 10 years. The death.rate of the Parish is indeed almost the same as it was in 1876 and in 1878, while the general London death.rate is almost the same as it was in 1878, but is 1 per thousand higher than it was in 1876,—the year 1877 being left out of consideration on account of the exceptional lowness of the death.rates both of London generally and of our Parish (see Table Ia.). Table Ia. Death Rates per 1,000 per annum. 1874. 1875. 1876. ]877. 1878. 1879.

Of the 23 large towns in the United Kingdom mentioned by the Registrar-General, only 1, viz., Portsmouth, with the exceptionally low rate of 16.7 per thousand per annum, had a lower death-rate than this Parish, the next being Brighton, with a rate of 19 per thousand per annum. Dublin, as usual, has the unenviable position of affording 75 the highest death.rate among the 23 towns, and a rate which has increased from 25.8 in 1876 to no less than 35.1 in 1879, which is 5.5 per thousand higher than it was in 1878. Liverpool, with a rate of 271, and Manchester, with one of 26.9, come next, as usual, but both show an improvement on their rates for 1878, which were 29.4 and 27.9 respectively. Among Foreign cities the lowest are, as last year, Philadelphia with 17.2, and Christiania with 17.5 per thousand per annum, and these are the only two of the thirty most important Foreign cities, of which the death. rates are known, that have lower rates than our Parish; the nearest after it being Cincinnati, 18.8, Baltimore, 20.3, and Brooklyn, 20.4. The highest rates recorded during the year are those of St. Petersburg, 40, and Alexandria, 39.1; that of Madras, which was 48 in 1878, having decreased to 34.4 in 1879. Table II. YEAR.

The highest birth.rate recorded in the large towns of the United Kingdom, in 1879, were those of Birmingham and of Salford, 40.1 in cach case, and the lowest that of Brighton, 29.8. The number of deaths of children under one year of age, was 298, a lower number than in any one of the previous six years, notwithstanding that there were 53 weeks in the year. The percentage of these deaths to the total births was, owing to the unusually small number of births, greater than it was in 1878, although less than in any year from 1873 to 1877, but, and this is much more important, the percentage of deaths of infants under one year of age to the total deaths, was only 14.48, or nearly one per cent. lower than in 1878, when it was more than 2 per cent. lower than in either of the preceding five years. This remarkable decrease in infant mortality is one of the best signs of sanitary improvement, although it must be remembered at the same time that the birth-rate has somewhat decreased. Table III.

In London generally the percentage of such deaths to the total deaths was only 22.61; this, however, was more than 2 per cent. higher than in 1878, although it was nearly 8 per cent lower than in our Parish. The fact that more than three.tenths of the total number of deaths were those of persons of 60 years and upwards is remarkable, and shows how large a number of people in this Parish attain a great age. The percentage of Violent Deaths, although less than in previous years, was, as usual, greater than in London gene. nerally, and is due to the fact that not only does the Thames * form one of the boundaries of the Parish, but that it also includes a large part of the Serpentine. The number of Inquest cases, 120 in the 53 weeks, was 3 less than in the 52 weeks of 1878, and the percentage of these cases to the total deaths was less than in that year, or than in any year since 1874, and was also less than in London generally.

I have given the figures representing the estimated populations of the Sub.Districts of the Parish, calculated on the same rate of increase (or decrease in the case of the Hanover Square Sub.District) as prevailed from 1861 to 1871, and various particulars relating to the births and deaths in each of the Sub.Districts and in the whole Parish. The birth.rates are corrected to 52 weeks, and the death. rates are corrected for the deaths in Public Institutions, and also to 52 weeks. From this Table it appears that the corrected birth.rates and death.rates of the Hanover Square Sub.District are identical, so that during the year the population of that Sub.District has been "stationary." The death.rate of the Hanover Square Sub.District is higher than that of either of the other Sub.Districts, while the birth.rate is lower. From Table IVa. it appears that the birth.rate of each of the Sub.Districts has decreased somewhat since last year, the rates approximating to those of 1877; and that the death.rate of the Hanover Square Sub.District has decidedly increased (being higher than in any year mentioned in the Table), and that of Mayfair slightly so, while that of Belgravia has diminished, and is almost as low as in the exceptional year 1877. The death.rate of the Parish as a whole is a trifle over the rates for 1876 and 1878. Table IVa. bibth.rates. death.rates. 1875. 1870. 1877. 1878. 1879. 1875. 1876. 1877. 1878. 1879.

Hanover Square Sub-District . 52.49 years. Mayfair „ 61.15 „ Belgravia „ 45.56 „ Whole Parish „ 48.55 „ These numbers are higher than last year for the whole Parish and for the Sub-Districts of Mayfair and Belgravia, but lower for that of Hanover Square. (The mean duration of life for the Belgravia SubDistrict during 1878 was given in last year's Report as 40.87 years; this was a mistake, it should have been 44.76 years.) The mean duration of life in this Parish, during the last five years, has been as follows:— In 1875 it was 46.67 years. „ 1876 „ 47.96 „ „ 1877 „ 49.52 „ „ 1878 „ 48.03 „ „ 1879 „ 48.55 „ So that in 1879 it was higher than in any of these years except 1877, when it was exceptionally high on account of the very low death-rate. The mean duration of life in London during the 53 weeks of 1879 was 34.23, or almost exactly the same as it was in 1878, when it was 34.24. I cannot, of course, in these calculations make any allowance for movements of the population. 80 Table V.

The number of such deaths per 1,000 of persons living was also much less than in London generally, for, whereas in London such deaths were in the proportion of 3.3 per 1,000 of the population, in this Parish they were only in the proportion of 1.8 per 1,000 of the population. Looking at these diseases separately, we find that, while the numbers of deaths from Measles, Scarlet Fever, and Diphtheria were higher than they were in either of the previous three years, there were no deaths from Small-pox, and the deaths from Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea were decidedly fewer than they were in 1878, and were considerably below the average of the last ten years. Measles and Scarlet Fever were both epidemic in the Parish and in London generally during the year; and Diphtheria was also very prevalent, and caused 14 deaths (including 2 of Non-Parishioners), a higher number than in any one of the previous 10 years with the exception of 1875, when it caused 16 deaths. The diminution in the number of deaths from the Continued Fevers, essentially preventible diseases, is most marked, and well worthy of notice. The total number of deaths from these fevers, Typhus, Enteric, and Simple Continued Fevers, was only 15, the smallest number in any one of the previous 10 years having been 23 in 1873, the average number nearly 31, and the number for 1878, 32. Of the 16 deaths from Continued Fevers, 2 were registered as Typhus, 12 as Enteric (Typhoid), 1 as Simple Continued Fever, and 1 as "Bilious Fever." The Registrar-General only gives 15 as the total of F 82 deaths from Fever in the Parish during the 53 weeks, viz., Typhus 2, Enteric 12, and Simple Continued Fever 1. This is because the death from Enteric Fever which occurred in February was omitted in his Weekly Return, as I pointed out in my Report for the 4 weeks ending March 1st. I have placed the death registered as " Bilious Fever" under Simple Continued Fever, while it is classed under Enteric in the Registrar-General's Returns, so that the number of deaths from Enteric Fever, viz., 12, is the same in both. Of the 2 deaths from Typhus Fever, 1 was that of a Non-Parishioner, and occurred at the Fulham Workhouse, and the other that of a person who lived almost entirely out of the Parish. They were, certainly, both imported cases. Of the 12 deaths from Enteric (Typhoid) Fever, 8 were those of Non-Parishioners, at St. George's Hospital, and 1 other was known to have been contracted out of the Parish ; so that only 4 at the most belonged to the Parish, and some of these may have been contracted elsewhere. Tho Parish has certainly been remarkably free from this disease during the year under review. Diarrhoea caused only 32 deaths, as against 54 in 1878, and an annual average of almost exactly 60 during the 10 years from 1869 to 1878; indeed, the number for 1879 was only approached in one of those years, viz., in 1877, when it was 35. Small-pox in London. The epidemic of this disease, which caused in London 2,544 deaths in 1877 and 1,416 in 1878, has considerably abated, having caused only 458 deaths in 1879. Nevertheless, this is a very high number when we note the fact that, in tho other 19 large towns in England, there were only in all 3 deaths in the year, and especially when we remember, as I pointed out in my Report for the five weeks ending 83 February 1st, 1879, that, "according to a recent report in the Times, the New York Bureau of Vital Statistics reports that in 1878 there were in that city (population about onethird that of London) only 2 deaths from Small-pox, the smallest number reported for any year since 1824, a result which is attributed to the activity of the vaccinating corps for some years past." ["Times," January 22nd, 1879 ] Sanitary Work. For the Year ending March 31st, 1880. The following Table has been compiled for me by Mr. Joseph Snook, your Sanitary Inspector, from the Report Book:— Table VI. Various lands of Complaints of Nuisances, &c., from April 1st, 1879, to March 31st, 1880. Total number of Complaints 614 Notices served 90 Houses and premises limewhited 33 Houses disinfected after infectious diseases 158 Old brick drains abolished, aud glazed stoneware pipes substituted 18 New drains constructed 3 Drains unstopped and repaired 78 Drains trapped and ventilated, sinks repaired, &c. 15 Closets supplied with water 35 Closets unstopped and repaired 39 Roofs repaired 8 New dust bins provided 1 Dust bins renewed, repaired, new covers, &c. 15 Cisterns repaired, new covers, &c. 1] 84 New cisterns provided 4 Waste pipes disconnected 8 Removal of animals improperly kept (cases of) 0 Meat, fish, &c., condemned (cases of) 7 Overcrowding abated 6 Cesspools abolished 2 Accumulation of dung, straw, &c., removed 78 Various nuisances removed 101 No cause for complaint on inspection 43 Legal proceedings taken 1 Cases could not assist 8 Cases referred to Surveyor 14 Cases referred to Police 1 Licensed cow-sheds 7 Licensed slaughter-houses 12 Cases removed to Hospitals 83 Inspection of houses after cases of infectious diseases, viz.— Typhoid and low fever . 9 Typhus fever 2 Scarlet fever 136 Small-pox 18 Diphtheria 10 The articles disinfected in the hot-air disinfecting chamber belonging to the Parish were as follows:— 155 Beds 156 Mattresses 64 Palliasses 144 Quilts 375 Blankets 101 Sheets 39 Dresses 12 Shawls 147 Bolsters 347 Pillows 8.1 Carpets 14 Hearth-rugs 49 Curtains 32 Towels 66 Cushions 27 Table Covers 85 40 Coats 13 Waistcoats 29 Rugs 7 Suits of clothing, and a large quantity of sundry articles. The total number of complaints was less than last year, as also was the number of notices served; but the number of houses disinfected after cases of infectious disease was greater, on account of the epidemic of Scarlet Fever. The number of houses in which Enteric (Typhoid) Fever was known to occur during the twelve months was only nine. It was only necessary to take out one summons for noncompliance with notice: this was for the non-removal of manure; the defendant was convicted, and ordered to pay the costs, and to remove the manure regularly. The Markets have been regularly inspected, and the result of this has been shown in the small number of articles requiring to be seized as unfit for food ; the most important instance being that of a consignment of 61 turkeys from Canada, in November 1879, which were reported to me by the consignee as unfit to be exposed for sale, and which were destroyed. In response to a letter from the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, and following the instructions of the Committee of Works, I inspected the sewage outfalls discharging into the Thames from this Parish, and prepared, conjointly with your Surveyor, a Report on the subject, which was printed and circulated by order of the Committee of Works. Some of the works therein suggested have been carried out, and others are in progress. At the request of the Guardians I inspected the Mortuary at the Infirmary in Fulham Road, and reported on it to them, making some suggestions, which were approved of by the Architect, for the improvement of its ventilation. 86 Having observed that the supply of water to the waterclosets in some of the Model Dwellings in the Parish was not satisfactory, I communicated with the Secretary, suggesting certain improvements. My suggestions were at once adopted, and the alterations are being made. In November last I thought it desirable to draw the attention of the Directors of the Companies owning Model Dwellings in the Parish to the desirability of their adopting a regulation requiring their tenants to send oases of infectious diseases to Hospitals; I received replies from the Secretaries of some of the Companies, expressing their willingness to do all that they could in the matter, and I know that beneficial result have ensued; but there is on the part of the majority of the tenants the greatest disinclination to send their children, suffering say from Scarlet Fever, away from homo, and so they conceal the fact that they have such a disease in the family as long as over they can. An extensive outbreak of Measles, happily of a very mild type, was reported to me as occurring in one of the Day Schools in the Parish; on investigating the facts I came to the conclusion that the epidemic had got to its height, and did not consider myself justified in advising that the School should be closed; but had all the houses where there were cases inspected, and prevented the other children in those houses from going to the School; the number of cases diminished daily, and the disease soon disappeared, without a case having ended fatally. At the request of the Vicar and Churchwardens I reported on the proposed site for a Mortuary in the disused burial ground, at the rear of the Vestry Offices, in Mount Street, and afterwards gave evidence on the subject before the Dean of Arches; but, as this occurred, and the faculty was granted before my last Annual Report went to the printers, I gave a full account of the matter in that Report. 87 The slaughter.houses and cow.sheds are regularly inspected and kept in a satisfactory condition; various alterations were required in the cow.sheds to make them comply with the requirements of the new Bye.Laws issued by the Metropolitan Board of Works, who now inspect them as well as the slaughter.houses. No application for a License was opposed by the Vestry or by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and they were all granted; those for the cow.sheds being withheld until the required alterations were carried out.

In both cases there is, on the average, a decided improvement on the preceding year, but as then the water occasionally supplied is of inferior quality, especially in the case of the Grand Junction Company, and I have written to direct their attention to the matter. It is generally when the river is in flood that the quality of the water is inferior, and the Chelsea Company find the advantage of their new large storage reservoirs, which hold a three weeks' supply for the whole of the district they serve, in that they need not take water in at all during floods in the river. The common gas supplied by the London Gas Company has been examined by me from time to time at their testing room, and has always been found to be above the required standard of illuminating power, and to satisfy the prescribed tests for ammonia and sulphuretted hydrogen. For the information of the Parishioners, I may mention that a hospital carriage for removing persons suffering from infectious diseases is kept at the Workhouse, in Mount Street; but those who are in a position to bear the expenses of their support should apply at the London Fever Hospital, Liverpool Road, Islington; or, in case of small-pox, at the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, where they can be accommodated on favourable terms.

The following convictions took place on my certificates Higgs, 12, Robert Street, and 10, Shephord Street; milk adulterated with 20 per cent. of water, convicted for this sample and also for one taken in January 1878, but for which the prosecution had been deferred pending tho decision of an Appoal Case; fined 2s. 6d. and £1 3s. costs in each case. H. Bennett, 2, Belgrave Mews East, was convicted of selling milk adulterated with 20 per cent. of added water, and fined £1 10s. and £1 3s. costs. Robert Field, 45, Warwick Street, Pimlico, was convicted of soiling milk from which nearly half of tho total fat had been removed by skimming, and fined £5 and 12s. 6d. costs. C. Fitter, 12, Market Street, Shepherd's Market, Mayfair, was convicted of selling milk containing 23 per cent. of added water, and fined 9s. 6d. and 12s 6d. costs. H. Bennett and R. Field were prosecuted by the Parish Inspector, Higgs and C. Fitter by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Dairymen's Association. The other 3 adulterated samples of milk were samples bought for information; 2 of them were watered, and 1 skimmed. In addition to these, two samples of milk were bought, one by your Inspoctor and one by the Inspector of the Metropolitan Dairymen's Association, at shops whore samples previously obtained for information had been found 91 to be adulterated. These second samples, however, I found to be genuine. The samples of milk classed as of doubtful quality contained too little cream, and had probably been skimmed. The samples of adulterated gin were watered to a somewhat greater extent than is allowed by the Act (viz., 35 degrees under proof), except in one case, which was part of a sample seized by tho Excise officers, and which was so largely watered that it only contained 15 per cent. of alcohol. In this instance, the vendor was convicted of selling spirits without a licence. The adulterated butters contained other fats (chiefly butterine) ; the adulterated coffees contained chicory; the adulterated mustards contained wheat flour and turmeric; and the adulterated peppers contained rice starch and sand from dusty berries. Some of the samples of tea contained small quantities of " Lie" tea. Most of the samples were only slightly adulterated. W. H. CORFIELD, Public Analyst.
