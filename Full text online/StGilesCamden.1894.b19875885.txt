The Past Year. This Report embraces the period from the 26th day of March, 1894, to the 25th day of March, 1895. During this period, 92 Meetings of the Board and Committees have been held, of which the following are the particulars:— Board Meetings— Ordinary 22 Special 5 Total — 27 Committee Meetings— Finance 21 Law and Parliamentary 5 Sanitary 13 Works 20 Special 6 Total — 65 Making in all a Total of 92 9 Changes in the Personnel of the Board, Considerable changes have taken place in the Membership of the Board during the year under review. At the election of Members in June, 1894, Messrs. Edward Angel, Alfred Barter, James Lawrence Graydon, Walter Hazell, M.P., Henry Stalker Crawford, Samuel Cousins and Henry Cooper Latreille, were elected in the place of Messrs, Sidney Ashley, John Henry Coulson, John Johnson, Charles Dibdin, Henry O. Gilbert, George Pearce and Samuel J. Thacker. The names of two Members have been removed by death, viz:—Messrs. H. F. Jackson and A. C. Ranyard, L.C.C., and during the year Mr. Wyatt Papworth, who was for many years a Member of the Board, passed away. The Work of the Year, An endeavour will be made in the ensuing pages of this Report to summarise very briefly some of the most important matters that have been brought under the consideration of the Board. There are, however, of course, an enormous number of matters of detail, many of which involve much time and consideration, but which in themselves are not of sufficient importance to justify their taking a place in the Annual Report. The Chairman of the Board. The Local Government Act, 1894, directed every District Board at the first meeting after the annual election of Members to elect a Chairman for the year. At the first meeting of the Board after the election of Members in June, 1894, George Philip Willoughby, Esq., was elected the first Chairman. 10 Bye-Laws. In consequence of the large increase in the amount of work which has to be transacted by the Board, it became necessary early in the year to take into consideration the Bye-laws for regulating the proceedings of the Board, and the question having been considered by a Special Committee, was dealt with by the Board itself in considerable detail, and as a result, a new set of Bye-laws was made on the 8th May, and confirmed on the 22nd May, 1894. These Bye-laws brought into one code several Bye-laws, regulations and Standing Orders which had been made by the Board from time to time, and dealt with important questions as to debate and the Notices to be given to Members of various matters. They also provided that the minutes of the Board Meetings should be printed and a copy forwarded to every Member with the agenda convening the meeting at which such minutes are proposed to be confirmed, and that in the absence of any resolution to the contrary, the minutes should be taken as read. This Byelaw has been found to work admirably, a great saving of time has been secured, and the expenditure incurred amply justified. It is proposed to bind a certain number of copies of the minutes at the close of each year, with index, so as to form a permanent record of the Board's proceedings. Accounts. The Annual Accounts are appended duly audited. The comparative statement which has been submitted during the past few years is again included. 11 COMPARATIVE STATEMENT of INCOME and EXPENDITURE For the years ending 25th March, 1894, and 25th March, 1895.

At the annual election of Library Commissioners in the month of June, 1894, Messrs. Richard Garnett, George P. Willoughby, and A. Cow per Ranyard, were elected. In the course of the year, in consequence of the lamented death of Mr. Ranyard, a vacancy occurred, which was filled by the appointment of Mr. Gilbert Smith. The work of erecting the Public Library is being rapidly progressed with, and the report of the Library Commissioners, which has been printed and circulated among the inhabitants, contains information as to the work being carried on. The amount of the precept for the ensuing year will be that realised by the rate of 1d. in the £. Unification of London. At the date of preparing the last Annual Report the Royal Commission appointed to consider the proper conditions under which the amalgamation of the City and County of London can be effected and to make specific and 13 definite proposals for that purpose had not reported, but upon the 7th August the Report was issued. It consisted of 124 paragraphs and made certain definite recommendations upon the subject. Every member of the Board was supplied with a copy of the Report and, through the courtesy of the Town Clerk of London, with a copy of the Report of the Special Committee of the Corporation of London on the Report of the Royal Commission. Both these reports were referred by the Board to the Law and Parliamentary Committee for consideration and report, and on the advice of that Committee the Board passed a Resolution agreeing with the Royal Commissioners in that part of their report which recommended that everything possible should be done to maintain the strength and authority of the Local bodies of London, and that they should be entrusted with every duty that they can conveniently discharge, and that strong Municipalities or District Councils should be formed with ample and enlarged powers, a central authority being at the same time preserved to carry out the functions which appertain to the entire Metropolis. The question of what further action should be taken on the Report of the Royal Commission is still under the consideration of the Law and Parliamentary Committee. Unemployed. The problem of how to successfully deal with the unemployed has been frequently referred to in previous years, but the subject is one which constantly recurs with increased difficulties. During the past year the Register of persons seeking employment was again brought into use, and the fact of its existence made known by posting bills 14 and advertisements in the neighbourhood. The subject was exhaustively considered by a Special Committee appointed by the Board, who reported that they had considered the whole question of what employment could be given in the District, that the Engineer and Surveyor had promised to employ as many additional men as was reasonably possible in the cleansing of the streets in the District, that the Register of unemployed persons was still kept at the offices of the Board, and that steps had been taken to bring the same to the notice of employers, as well as those seeking employment. Subsequent to this a communication was received from the Local Government Board on the 19th February, requesting information on the following points:— 1. Whether there is any exceptional distress in the District, and how far this is due to circumstances peculiar to the locality or the severe weather. 2. What is being done to meet the distress by Public Authorities or by voluntary agencies, and the average daily numbers relieved by each of the agencies during the week ending Saturday, 16th February? 3. Is an unemployed Register maintained and with what result? 4. Have you any suggestions to make for the purpose of relieving such distress? In answer to these enquiries the Chairman of the Board addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Local Government Board of which the following is an extract. 1. So far as this Board is aware there is not any exceptional distress in the District. 15 2. The Board are finding work for as many men as possible, till recently a large number of men have been employed in removing the snow, and since that was disposed of the Engineer and Surveyor have been employing additional men in scavenging the public ways, but I am bound to say that the men employed are of a class of casual labourers who do not seem likely to ever obtain constant employment at any time, owing to their failure to give a fair day's work for a fair day's wage. The Board are not aware of the efforts of any voluntary agencies within the District. 3. A Register of unemployed persons seeking work has been kept at these offices since 1887, I regret however to say that the Officers report that the result is not satisfactory and that the Register is not made use of by employers seeking workmen. 4. If it is considered a duty that work should be found for every unemployed workman the burden should not be cast on Local Authorities unless a grant from Imperial of other Public funds in aid of Local rates is made, otherwise the burden would be too heavy, especially in the case of highly rated parishes like those forming this District, where the rates which were already high have been increased in consequence of the London Equalization of Rates Act, to 6s. 8d. in the £. The advisability of combining with the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and the Board of Works for the Strand District who have established a Labour Bureau at the St. Martin's Town Hall has been under consideration but no decision come to. 16 Equalization of Rates, The London Equalization of Rates Bill, introduced into the House of Commons on the 29th. March, 1894, received the Royal assent on the 25th day of August. The Board on the recommendation of the Law and Parliamentary Committee presented a Petition to the House of Commons against the Bill on the ground that it would press unduly and unfairly on the St. Giles District. That this was the case was evidenced by the Return issued by the London County Council in November last, setting forth the sums payable by certain parishes and receivable by certain sanitary Districts under the Act. The following extract from a communication addressed to the Local Government Board points out concisely the effect of the Act on the St. Giles District:— The Rateable value of the St. Giles District on the 6th April, 1894, was the sum of £420,890, the population at the census, 1891, was 39,782. The Act requires the formation of an Equalization Fund equal to a rate of 6d. in the £ on the rateable value of London according to the valuation lists as they stand on the 6th day of April in every year. The London County Council are, every half year, to determine the contribution from each Parish to one half of the equalization fund, and to ascertain the amount due from that one half of the fund to each Parish by apportioning the amount of half the equalization fund among the Sanitary Districts in proportion to their population. Where the contribution exceeds the amount due to the Parish, the Council shall, for the special purpose of meeting the excess, levy on the Parish a county contribution called the equalization charge, as a separate item of the County Rate. From the return 17 prepared by the Statistical Officer of the London ounty Council, it appears that the amount of the first half yearly contribution from the united Parishes of St. Giles and Bloomsbury to one half of the equalization fund will be £5,261 2s. 6d., that the grant according to the population "will be £3,859 13s. 5d., and that the result will be that the equalization charge is in excess of the contribution over the grant, by the sum of £1,401 9s. 1d. The attention of the Committee was directed to the debate which took place when the Bill was considered in Committee in the House of Commons, when the Right Hon. George Shaw Lefevre, M.P., the President of the Local Government Board, stated that the object of the Bill was to give relief to the poorer classes, that all the more heavily rated Parishes would receive relief, and all the more lightly rated Parishes would contribute to the equalization fund, and that no Parish would be called upon to contribute whose rates were above the average of 5s 5d. in the £, It appears, however, that for the current year, excluding the Library rate, the rates in the St. Giles District are 6s. 6d. in the £, and that when the amount payable under the Act is added, including the cost of collection, the rates will amount to 6s. 8d. in the £, 1s. 3d. above the average rate in the County of London. No answers beyond a formal acknowledgment to this or any other letters which have been addressed to the Local Government Board upon the subject have been received. Price of Gas. In the month of June last a communication was received from the Secretary and General Manager of the Gas Light and Coke Company intimating a reduction in the price of gas supplied to private consumers in the district north of the Thames. c 18 The following statement on the subject, which was submitted by the Clerk to the Board, may be of interest, and it is therefore reproduced;— In the district north of the Thames supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company, the price of gas is governed by the rules laid down under Section 19 of the Gas Light and Coke Company's Act, 1876. Section 19 provides that the standard price for common gas shall be 3s. 9d. per 1000 cubic feet, which shall be increased or diminished, subject to a decrease or increase in the rate of dividend, to be calculated as follows;—For every penny charged in excess or diminution of the standard price, the standard rate of dividend shall be reduced or increased by 5s. in the £100 per annum. A limit is placed upon the Capital, which cannot be increased except under certain conditions, and when additional capital is raised the new shares must be offered for sale by auction or tender. The standard rate of dividend is defined by Section 10 of the Act as 10 per cent. per annum. Section 21 provides that if the clear profits in any year amount to a larger sum than is sufficient to pay the standard rate of dividend, the excess shall be invested and form an insurance fund. The supply of gas to public lamps is governed by Section 24 of the Gas Works Clauses Act, 1871, which require gas to be supplied within certain distances, and the price to be charged to be settled by agreement between the Local Authorities and the Gas Company, or in case of differences, to be settled by arbitration, regard being had to the circumstances of the case and the price charged to private consumers 19 in the district. The question of the mode of estimating the price of gas supplied to public lamps was discussed and laid down by the Honourable George Denman, Q.C., in the Gravesend case, in the year 1868. Upon consideration of the matter the Board passed a resolution in favour of a Parliamentary enquiry being instituted into the present arrangements and workings of the several companies supplying gas in the metropolis, with a view to a fair and uniform charge per 1000 cubic feet being made throughout the whole of London. A copy of this resolution was forwarded to every authority in London. Cab-Stands. The Commissioner of Police has, during the past year, made several alterations in the situation of cab-stands in the District, and the Departmental Committee appointed to inquire into the Metropolitan Cab Service having invited suggestions from the Board upon the subject, a communication was addressed to the Committee, intimating that in the opinion of the Board more cab-stands and cab-shelters should be provided in suitable places in the District; that where a cab-stand is provided a proper water-post should be fixed, and that cab-stands and cab-shelters should be under the control of the Local Authority, the expenses connected therewith being paid out of the County rate. Sanitary Work. A very large number of nuisances have been dealt with and much good work carried out during the past year. The following statistics as to the work under the Public Health (London) Act show the activity which has existed:— C 2 20 Visits and inspections made 11,209 Notices for abatement of nuisances served 823 Proceedings before Police Magistrates 24 Fines and costs recovered, £7 9s. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, eleven representations were made by the Medical Officer of Health, and the necessary steps taken with a view to closing the premises. The following are the particulars:— Locality. Present Condition of Premises. 14, Little Guilford Street Demolished. 2, Chapel Mews do. 30, Kenton Street (cottage in rear) Repaired and reopened. 12, Handel Street Repaired. 1, 2, 3, 4, Kennedy Court Premises undergoing reconstruction. 45, Colonnade Demolished. 18 and 19, Drury Lane do. The Regulations made by the Board as to Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family still continue to be enforced within the District. The Local Government Board on the 18th May forwarded a copy of Model Bye-laws, which they suggested the Board should make in lieu of the existing Regulations. The matter having been referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, the following recommendation was unanimously adopted, and the Local Government Board was so informed:— That having regard to the fact that the regulations as to houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, which were made on the 22nd day of February, 1887, and approved by the Local Government Board on the 31st day of March, 1887, have been in force for over seven years, and seeing that 451 houses in the District are at 21 present registered thereunder, and that the regulations have been found to work well, and no case of difficulty has occurred, and having regard to the fact that under previous regulations which were based on the model clauses prepared by the Local Government Board and which were similar in certain details to the Model Bye-laws now prepared, legal difficulties arose, the Committee are of opinion that there is no necessity for the substitution of a new series of Bye-laws for those at present in force; and recommending that a communication embodying the whole of the facts connected with the Bye-laws be forwarded to the Local Government Board in reply to their letter. During the year the whole of the Registered Lodging Houses were regularly visited, with the following result:— Notices for abatement of breaches of Regulations served 354 Proceedings against Owners before Police Magistrates 5 Fines and Costs recovered, £2 15s. On the 6th day of February, 1895, Harry St. John, a builder, was prosecuted for having constructed a drain at the premises No. 167, High Holborn, in such a manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health, contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and was fined £5 and costs. This was the first prosecution under Section 42 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, within the District, and it is hoped the result will have a salutary effect on those entrusted with the work of drainage of premises, the necessity for the proper execution of which is of such great importance. In the course of the year the Local Government Board addressed a communication to the Board intimating that, with a view to preventing a visitation of Cholera, they were 22 prepared to give favourable consideration to any application which might be made to add Diarrhoea to the list of notifiable diseases in the District under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Board immediately acted upon this suggestion, and passed a Resolution, which was ultimately confirmed, applying the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with reference to the notification of Infectious Diseases, to Diarrhoea until the 29th September, 1894. Fortunately the necessity for a further extension of this resolution has not arisen, but during the period that it was in force no less than ninety-eight cases were notified. The Analyst's report, which will be found on page 26, records the number of samples submitted for analysis under the Sale of Foods and Drugs Act and the Margarine Act. A total of 348 samples were purchased and analysed, of these 40 were adulterated, but in 21 cases the adulteration was not sufficient to justify any proceedings being taken; in the other cases prosecutions ensued, and fines and costs amounting in the whole to £14 12s. Od. were inflicted. Slaughter Houses and Public Abattoirs. During the year the question of the desirability of the abolition of private slaughtering of meat in crowded districts in the Metropolis was under consideration, and the views of the various Local Authorities in the Metropolis were invited, There was, however, such a considerable divergence of opinion upon the question as to whether Public Abattoirs should or should not be established, that the Board finally decided to take no action in the matter. British Institute of Public Health. At the invitation of the British Institute of Public Health the following Members and Officers were appointed 23 Delegates to the London Congress held under the Honorary Presidency of the Rt. Hon. the Lord Mayor of London, the President for the year being Professor W. R. Smith, a member of the Board:— George P. Willoughby, Esq., J.P., Chairman of the Finance Committee. Lieut.-Col. E. J.

Copies of the resolutions arrived at were communicated to the Board and entered on the Minutes. Effect has already been given to certain of the recommendations. Underground Conveniences. The Underground Convenience for men and women constructed by the Board in Shaftesbury Avenue continues to be of great public advantage. The gross receipts from the Convenience during the past year amounted to £381 17s. 9d. The question of providing a new Underground Convenience at the junction of New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road was decided on in the month of February, and the tender of Messrs. C. W. Killing back and Co. for the construction of the same for the sum of £2,379 was accepted on the 19th March. Towards the cost of this Messrs. Meux and Co., Limited, have agreed to make a contribution of £500, in consideration of the Board removing the urinal in Bainbridge Street and consenting to the cul de sac leading out of Dyott Street, and known as New Street, being closed. 24 Obstructions in Courts and Alleys. In the course of the year the attention of the Board was drawn by the Chairman (George P. Willoughby, Esq., J.P.) to the existence of posts in certain courts and alleys in the District which would prevent the passage into them of fireescapes. The matter was subsequently investigated by the Works Committee, and upon the recommendation of that Committee it was resolved that moveable posts be substituted for the fixed posts at the eastern end of Twyford Buildings, and that the lamp-posts in Denmark Place be removed and bracket-lamps substituted in lieu thereof, the two places in question being the only ones in which obstructions under the control of the Board exist which would prevent the free access of fire escapes. London Building Act, 1894. The London Streets and Buildings Bill, which was referred to at some length in the last report, has passed into law. A copy of the Act has been forwarded to every Member of the Board, and the advantage of the amended legislation has already made itself manifest. Re-naming of Streets, In the course of the year several communications have been received and representations made to the London County Council in favour of the re-naming of certain thoroughfares in the Distinct. The following orders have been made by the Council and carried into effect:— Charlotte Street is now incorporated with Bloomsbury Street; Red Lion Yard (Southampton Row), re-named Redcar Yard; King's Arms Yard (Silver Street), re-named Monarch Yard; Market Street, re-named Barter Street; Duke 25 Street (north of New Oxford Street), re-named Coptic Street; Duke Street (south of New Oxford Street), Brewer Street and Hyde Street now incorporated as Hyde Street. The question of renaming the following streets is still under consideration: Brunswick Mews, Caroline Mews, Tavistock Street Lincoln's Inn Fields. The London County Council's General Powers Bill, 1894, having become law, the powers vested in the Trustees of Lincoln's Inn Fields by the Act of George II. were transferred to the Council on terms agreed on and incorporated in the Act, and the bye-laws made by the Council having been applied to Lincoln's Inn Fields, the Gardens were thrown open to the public by Sir John Hutton, Chairman of the Council, on Saturday the 23rd February, 1895. Employees' Holiday. For the first time since the constitution of the Board a day's holiday was voted to the employees, which took place on Saturday the 7th July. The sum of £10 was voted by the Board as an addition to the men's wages towards the expenses, and certain contributions, amounting in the whole to £4 13s. 6d., were made by individual members. On the 10th July a report was received stating that the outing had been an entire success. HENRY C.

The Holborn Restaurant, Limited, having extended its premises and formed a new Hall with entrance from Newton Street, requested the Board to widen the carriageway of that thoroughfare so as to allow three vehicles to pass at a time. The carriageway of the said street being in bad repair and needing relay, the Board assented to the request, and the carriageway, which before the alteration varied from 15 feet 10 inches to 16 feet 3 inches, was made of an average width of 19 feet, this being done by setting back the footways on each side to a small extent.

The main thoroughfares in the District were watered twice on Sundays during the summer months between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., and the market streets between 12 and 2.30, when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. In the latter watering, disinfectants were added to the contents of the cart. The cleansing of the principal carriage-ways throughout the District on Sundays, in accordance with the orders of the Board of January, 1894, was continued during the year, the additional cost of which, estimated by me at £212 8s., actually amounted to £211 12s. 9d. The whole cost of Sunday cleansing for the 12 months—Lady Day, 1894, to Lady Day—1895, was £581 12s. 9d. Removal of Snow. Snow fell frequently during the early part of the year 1895, and on many occasions to a considerable depth, necessitating the employment of additional men and wagons to deal with the snow. The bulk of it, as in previous years, was carted to the Thames Embankment and thrown into 51 the River, but a considerable quantity was thrown down the Sewer side entrances in the District into the public sewers, men being placed in the sewers to scatter the snow and prevent obstruction. The dissolving of the snow by water taken from the New River Company's mains through jet and hose, and also by means of water-carts, was also largely resorted to, a considerable quantity being thus reduced to a sufficiently liquid state to run down the street gullies. The water used for these flushing purposes amounted to 1,048,735 gallons. The total number of extra hands employed over the several snow falls was 1,574, and the snow removed by cartage was equal to 3,586 cubic yards. The total additional expense incurred in consequence of snowfall for the year being £1,008 17s. 3d. Cost or Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1894-95 was as follows:— £ s. d. "Wages of men and boys 3,155 18 5 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 580 16 1 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines 3,525 15 6 Removal of snow, additional labour, cartage, &c. 1,008 17 3 Total £8,271 7 3 Street Watering. The watering of the public wajs was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to e 2 52 water those courts and alleys in the District not available for vehicular traffic or which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The total quantity of water used (including that used for washing the streets) amounted to 4,356,000 gallons. Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing all necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £3,650. The number of van-loads removed amounted to 8,656. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District after their contents had been removed by the contractor's men, with carbolic acid powder, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant used being £19 2s. 6d. Limewhiting Courts, The walls at the entrances to the following yards, courts, mews, &c., in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year, at a cost of £45. During the summer months a small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 206 7 0 To contractor for horses, carts, and men 1,009 12 0 For permanganate of potash put into the water vans 17 0 0 Total . £1,232 19 0 53 Public Urinals. The urinal in Hunter Mews, which was built into the side wall of the house No. 11, Handel Street, and projected over a portion of the area of the said house, became, in consequence of the re-building of a part of the premises, in a very unsafe condition, and your Board, taking into consideration I he complaints received in respect of the urinal, ordered its demolition. The premises No. 9, Little Guilford Street, being pulled down for re-building, involved the removal of the urinal built against the wall of the premises at the entrance into Bernard Mews. Your Board thereupon entered into negociation with the Freeholders of the property, the Governors of the Foundling Hospital, for a site for the erection of a new urinal in the immediate vicinity, and ultimately the Governors agreed to lease to the Board, at a rental of £1 per annum, a piece of land on the east side of Little Guilford Street, north of No. 15, for the purpose. A new urinal with accommodation for 4 persons has since been erected there, and was opened to the public on the 13th April, 1895. Clarkes Buildings. Neals Yard. Clarkes Mews. New Yard. Colonnade.

Jennings, its original builder, at a cost of £84 15s. It was opened to the public on the 9th February, 1895. The urinals at present in the District number 13, and contain 52 compartments; water is laid on to the whole of them. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST.

Public Lighting, As occasion has arisen during the year, new circular lamps have been fixed in lieu of the old, square lanterns The total number of lamps in the District is 1,152, of which 918 are circular lanterns, 60 are square lanterns at the junctions of streets, with the names of the streets attached, 11 are metered lamps on street-crossing refuges, and the remainder are bracket lamps and lamps of the old square pattern. The amount paid for gas, including the lighting 55 and extinguishing, cleansing and maintaining the lanterns, was £3,928 14s. 5d. As in previous years, the lamps in the main public ways within the District were lighted during dark and foggy days at a cost of £3 18s. 11d. for the year, which is included in the above amount. The St. Pancras Vestry, having adopted the system of electric lighting within a certain portion of its Parish, placed large electric lamps in the middle of Tottenham Court Road, extending as far south as Store Street, where the agreed line of demarcation between the two Parishes for the maintainence of the paving comes. This rendered the public gas lamps on the east side of Tottenham Court Road between Store Street and the boundary of St. Giles District unnecessary, and an agreement was accordingly entered into between the Board and the St. Pancras Vestry for putting these lamps out of lighting, St. Pancras Vestry taking the responsibility of lighting the whole of the road, footways and carriage-ways, north of Store Street, the Board undertaking the lighting of the whole of the gas lamps south of Store Street. Street Refuges. The street-crossing refuge in Shaftesbury Avenue, between Endell Street and High Street, being found of great obstruction to horses and vehicles going to the drinking trough opposite the Endell Street Schools, was removed a few feet farther eastward ; this enabled a considerable alteration to be made in the levels of the adjoining paving, which much improved the approach to the said trough, and lessened the risk of accidents, which had previously occurred there somewhat frequently. 56 The refuges in the St. Giles District are as follows:— In Bedford Place south end. „ Broad Street east of Endell Street. „ Charing Cross Road north end, by High Street. Do. by New Compton Street. Do. south end, by Cambridge Circus. „ Endell Street north end, by Broad Street. „ Guilford Street west end, by Russell Square. „ High Holborn east of Little Queen Street.

Tne weighbridge in the Board Stone Yard having for some years been getting continually out of order, and, moreover, being constructed to weigh two wheeled vehicles only, was removed in December last, and a new weighbridge, to take four wheeled vehicles and to weigh up to 10 tons, was constructed. The old bridge had been in use a very large number of years, and was of an obsolete type. The new 57 bridge was supplied by Messrs. Poolley and Son, at a cost of £66 15s., exclusive of foundations, masonry, &c„ which was executed by the Boards own workmen. Your Board had under consideration the removal of any obstructions in the public ways in the District, which would prevent the passage of fire escapes in the event of fire, and there being but two places in the District where such existed, had them removed, the lamp columns in Denmark Place being taken away and bracket lamp substituted, and hinged fall-down posts placed in lieu of the fixed iron guard posts in Twyford Buildings. In connection with the new Disinfecting Apparatus, referred to in my Report of 1892-3, the old iron trucks for the collection and return of goods to be disinfected becoming worn out, three new wood trucks have been purchased at a cost of £21 each. The premises in Bernard Mews which consisted entirely of stable buildings, having been pulled down for the purposes of rebuilding, a proposal was received from the Secretary of the Foundling Hospital, on whose estate the Mews stand, for a re-arrangement of the frontage lines, which, were very irregular, and after some consideration your Board agreed to the proposition, and new lines of frontage were arranged, by which the Foundling Hospital threw into the public way, about 1600 feet superficial, taking in exchange about 176 feet superficial. The old stables in Brunswick Mews also being pulled down, and new premises erected, the sites of certain premises which stood at the north and south ends of the mews containing a superficial area of about 88 yards, were thrown into the public way—but the Board has accepted no liability 58 with respect to the same, the paving and maintenance of the land in question being, under the conditions of their Leases, thrown upon the Lessees of the premises in the Mews fronting the same. Your Board on the application of the London Hydraulic Power Company, sanctioned the laying of new Hydraulic mains in Bucknall Street, and the extension of existing mains in Great Russell Street and Bloomsbury Street. J he garden seats which were presented to the Board by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, and were placed on the triangular piece of land in the Shaftesbury Avenue, were, on complaint of the surrounding inhabitants, that they were made most objectionable use of, removed and iron benches without backs substituted, and other seats presented to the Board by the Association, which were placed in North and South Cre3cents, were also on a petition of the surrounding inhabitants removed—the seats were subsequently placed in St. Giles Churchyard.

GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you a report upon the samples submitted to me for analysis under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act during the year ending the 31st March, 1895. The total number of samples of food examined during this period was 348, a very considerable increase upon the two preceding years, when the figures were:— 1892-3—220, and 1893-4—266. Of these 348 samples 174 were purchased by Inspector William Henry Bond and a similar number by Inspector John Robinson. In the following table will be found a list of the articles analysed, showing also how many have been examined during each quarter of the year:— ARTICLE. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quar'er. 4th Quarter.

The percentage of adulteration during the previous twelve months was 19.1. MILK. Considerable attention has again been paid to this most important article of food, 187 samples having been taken, 23 of these (14 9 per cent.) have been certified to be adulterated, while 15 have been reported to be of poor quality. During the year 1893-4 25.6 per cent. of the milk examined was found to be adulterated. The nature and amount of the adulteration was as follows:— No. of Sample.

Of the 35 samples of butter 4 or 11.4 per cent. were found to be adulterated. These were all instances of the substitution of margarine for butter, and were certified to contain at least 70 per cent. of foreign fat (fat other than the fat of butter). The distinguishing marks of these adulterated samples were G 10, G 20, G 281 and G 287. The 7 samples of cheese examined were certified to be genuine. Each contained a fair proportion of fat. 14 specimens were submitted for analysis, only one of which was found to be below the standard, and that only to a very small extent. G 60 was certified to be 26 degrees under proof. The legal standard is 25 degrees under proof. One of the 12 samples of gin was slightly below the standard (35 degrees under proof), G78 being certified to be 36 degrees underproof. CHEESE. BRANDY. GIN, No. of Sample.

The annual birth.rate of the District was equal to 26.8 per 1,000, being 1.1 per 1,000 lower than the rate for the ten years average. There was one birth to 37.1 inhabitants. The birth rates for the two parishes again show a remarkable difference, whilst on the one hand, St. Giles. in.the.Fields maintains and even increases its high rate of 35.1 per 1,000, Bloomsbury shows a steady decline of 2.4 per 1000 below the rate for 1893, and 5*3 below the rate for the decennial average. If St. Giles, North, with a population of 9,633 can show a birth.rate of 26.3 per 1.000, and Bloomsbury, with 16,695 inhabitants, only 15.5 per 1,000, there can be but little doubt but that the population of the latter parish is very migratory. In Registration London the number of births was 130,533, and the birth.rate 30.1 per 1,000. The birth.rate in England and Wales in 1894, was 29.6 per 1,000 of the population, the lowest rate ever recorded, 78 and was 2.0 per 1,000 below the mean rate in the ten years 1884.93.

In addition to the deaths registered in the District, 216 parishioners died in outlying hospitals, where they had been removed for treatment, and 68 non-parishioners died in Public institutions within the District, viz., 30 at the Workhouse, Endell Street, 35 at the French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue, and 3 at the British Lying.in.Hospital, Endell Street. The corrected deaths were, therefore:— St. George, Bloomsbury 186 St. Giles, South 411 St. Giles, North 148 Total 745 74 There was one death to every 53.1 inhabitants. The annual death-rate was equal to 18.7 per 1,000 ; this rate, which is 4.8 per 1,000 lower than the decennial average, is the lowest since 1887, when it was identical. The death-rate for the parish of Bloomsbury is the lowest of which I have any record. The death-rate for St. Giles-in-the-Fields was one point in excess of the previous year. In Registration London, 77,039 deaths were equal to a death-rate of 17.8 per 1,000. In England and Wales, the 498,515 deaths were equivalent to an annual death-rate of 16.6 per 1,000. This death-rate was even more remarkable than the birthrate, being not only the lowest ever recorded, but as much as 1.5 per 1,000 under the lowest previous rate, viz., 18T in 1888. The death-rate in 1894 was also 2.6 per 1,000 below the mean annual rate in the preceding ten years. Infant mortality in London last year measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to registered births was equal to 143 per 1,000, and was below the mean proportion in the ten preceding years:— In the West group of Districts 142 „ North „ 121 „ East „ 161 „ South „ 131 „ Central „ 161 Infantile Mortality. 75 This table shows that a heavy infantile mortality prevails over the Central Districts of the Metropolis (which includes St. Giles) ; it occurs chiefly amongst the children of the poor, and is mainly due to bad feeding and neglect. In this District 144 infants died under one year of age, and 103 between 1 and 5 years, making a total of 247 children's deaths under 5 years of age. This number was less than in the previous year. The mortality of infants under 1 was in the proportion of 134 deaths to 1,000 registered births, and 193 per 1,000 of total deaths. On referring to table 3, appendix, it will be seen that the diseases which caused the greatest fatality at this period of life were: measles 15, whooping-cough 26, diphtheria 9, diarrhoea 9, different forms of scrofula 34, premature birth, &c., 26, convulsions 10, bronchitis and pneumonia 56, debility, inanition, &c., 30, and suffocation in bed with parents 6. Regarding "Suffocation of Infants,"—Dr. Danford Thomas, the Coroner for Central Middlesex, stated " that he had held 300 inquests annually on children who were killed by sleeping with their parents. There were over 1,000 children suffocated in London alone. He had, since he held office, to receive verdicts of accidental suffocation between 3,000 and 4,000 times. If parents would only consider a little they would see that it was a highly dangerous thing to have their infants to sleep in bed with them, for they ran many risks of getting suffocated. They were likely to get down in the bed, and even a sheet was quite sufficient to cause suffocation. It would be better for the infants that they should sleep in a cot." 76 But cots are not at all times safe, for during the past twelve months a verdict was returned that an infant parishioner, age 2 months, had died from " suffocation when in a cot, and face in pillow, accident." Senile Mortality. 152 persons died at 65 years, and upwards, being equivalent to 20.4 per cent. of total deaths. The equivalent percentage for London was 22.3. The following table shows the age distribution of the deaths:— 50 died between 65 and 70 years of age. 74 „ 70 and 80 „ 25 „ 80 and 90 „ 2 died at 93 years of age 1 „ 94 Only 39 of these were certified to have died of old age, i.e., decay of nature, and not from any known cause of disease ; the causes of the other deaths were chiefly diseases of the lungs and respiratory organs. Uncertified Deaths. 3 deaths (2 adults and 1 infant) were returned by the Registrars as not having been certified by a Registered Medical Practitioner, or by the Coroner after inquest. The deaths were duly reported to the Coroner, who considered inquests unnecessary. The alleged causes of death were "pneumonia," "heart disease," and "premature birth," respectively. 77 These deaths were equal to 0.4 per cent. of the total deaths. Throughout England and Wales the deaths in the course of the year included 12,496 cases, or 2.5 per cent. In all London, 651, or 0.8 per cent. Deaths in Public Institutions. (Within the District.) I. The Workhouse, Endell Street. The total number of inmates during 1894 was:— Parishioners of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and St. George, Bloomsbury 605 Do. Wandsworth 43 Do. Bethnal Green 36 Do. Strand 1 Total 685 The number of deaths during the four quarters of the year was:— 1st Quarter 55 2nd Quarter 35 3rd Quarter 22 4th Quarter 29 Total 141 equivalent to an annual death-rate of 20.5 per 1,000. This rate is calculated from the total number of deaths in the Workhouse, and does not include the deaths of parishioners at Cleveland Street Sick Asylum. 78 II. The French Hospital, Shaftesbury Avenue. According to the corrected Census returns of 1891, the population of this hospital was 67. The mortality in 1894 was 37, being one more than in the previous year. 34 of the deaths were those of non-parishioners, admitted for treatment from the surrounding districts. 26 of the patients died from consumption, and other chest complaints, 4 from heart disease, 2 from enteric fever, and 1 from traumatic tetanus (lock-jaw), resulting from varicosed ulcer of the leg. 21 of the deaths occurred at the middle period of life, and 5 at advanced ages. III. The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. This Institution, founded in 1749, and rebuilt in 1849, is the oldest Lying-in Hospital in London. It has been established as a charity for the purpose of assisting poor married women only. The Hospital is the means, through its Training School, of supplying midwives and monthly nurses of a superior class to the community at large. Particulars of fees, &c., can be obtained from the Secretary. The Medical Staff of the Hospital report for the year 1894:— " In-Patient Department.—"The results of the first three months of the year, i.e., to the end of March, indicated that some radical change of routine treatment was necessary, as * 3 deaths had occurred in 31 cases admitted during the time, and 5 other cases were seriously ill. The Medical Staff met the Committee, and as a result the hospital was * Non-parishioners. 79 closed for fourteen days, a new labour ward opened, and strict rules for the carrying out of antiseptic precautions made. "We are glad to say that the second period, viz., from April 12th to December 31st, has been marked by the most distinct improvement, 162 cases having been admitted with no maternal death, and, what is more important, the hygienic condition of the hospital has not been so satisfactory pince 1881. The total number of children born during the year was 198, of whom 4 were still-born. " In the Out-Patient Department 290 mothers were delivered, and in each instance the result was entirely satisfactory."

G 82 Five of the total deaths were children under 5 years of age. The Trustees of the Peabody Donation Fund submit in their Annual Report for the year 1894, that they have provided for the artizan and labouring poor of London, 11,261 rooms, besides bath.rooms, laundries, and lavatories. These rooms comprised 5,073 separate dwellings. The number of persons in residence to the end of the year was 19,918. The average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9¼d. per week, and of each room 2s. 1¾d. The annual birth rate was 36.3 per 1,000, and the death. rate 15'7 per 1,000.

There were two births during the year, both in Holland Buildings, and 3 deaths—2 adults and 1 child. The birth-rate was equal to 7.6 per 1,000, and the deathrate to 11.5 per 1,000. The one zymotic death from measles was equal to a rate of 3.8 per 1,000. Deaths in Certain Classes of Diseases, 1.—Specific, Febrile, or Zymotic Diseases. This class of diseases comprises six orders, viz., 1 miasmatic, 2 diarrhoea, 3 malarial, 4 zoogenous, 5 venereal, and 6 septic. The first and second orders include the diseases, which the Registrar-General describes as the seven principal diseases, considered to be more or less of a preventable character. In St. Giles District, the deaths in 1894 from these infectious diseases were 80, corresponding to a zymotic death-rate of 2.0 per 1,000, a rate slightly below that of the previous year. In Registration London, these diseases caused 11,467 deaths, equal to a rate of 2.6 per 1,000, against 3.1 in 1893. In England and Wales these deaths numbered 52,771, and were equal to a rate of 176 per 1,000. 85 Miasmatic Order. 1.—Small-pox, Decennial Average (1884-93) 4.2 per 1,000. The prevalence of small-pox in London showed a marked decline during 1894, the cases notified being 1,192, against 423 and 2,813 in the preceding two years. The number of small-pox patients admitted into the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals during 1894 was 1,117. The number of deaths was 89 in London, and 818 in England and Wales. The deaths from it at the Metropolitan Asylums Board showed a mortality of 8.87 per cent. of patients treated. In St. Giles District, the following table shows the number of cases, and deaths for the past ten years, and the number in 1894:— Year. Cases.

In 1893, nearly one-third of the cases were removed from the casual and receiving wards of the Workhouse, and 87 VAGRANTS AND THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE, ESPECIALLY SMALL-POX. A well-attended conference of representatives of Metropolitan and provincial sanitary authorities took place in July, at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, to discuss the means to be taken to prevent the spread of disease by vagrants. Sir John Hutton, Chairman of the London County Council, presided. The resolutions of the Conference, at which your Board was represented, were carried as follows:— 1. That common shelters, which are not subject to the law relating to common lodging-houses, should be made subject to such law. 2. That there should be power to Local Authorities to require medical examination of all persons entering common lodging-houses, and casual wards, and that each inmate of a casual ward or common lodging-house should on admission have a bath of fresh water. 3. That the Local Authorities should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging-house, in which there has been infectious disease, to refuse fresh admissions for such times as may be required by the Authority. 4. That the Local Authority should be empowered to require the temporary closing of any common lodging-house in which infectious disease has occurred. 5. That the Local Authority should have power to require the detention of any inmate of a common lodging-house, or casual ward, who may reasonably be suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. 6. That means should be provided for the detention and isolation of any vagrant found wandering in a public place, if reasonably supposed suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. 7. That the Local Authority should have full power to require the disinfection of the person, and clothes of any person, in a common lodging-house, or casual ward, whether infected or exposed to infection. 8. That arrangements should be made by which the occurrence of infectious disease in common lodging-houses, or casual wards, should be made known by the Local Authority of the District to the Local Authorities of other districts. 9. That Local Authorities should be empowered to require the vaccination or re-vaccination of persons in common lodging-houses, or casual wards, who are exposed to the infection of small-pox. 88 These recommendations were directed to be forwarded to the Local Government Board, with the view of getting them embodied in a Bill to be placed before Parliament. Your Board agreed with resolutions 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8, and directed a communication to that effect to be addressed to the Local Government Board. 2.—Measles (decennial average 28 4 per 1,000) caused 15 deaths in 1894, all young children ; this number is considerably below the average. 3.—Scarlet Fever (decennial average 7.5 per 1,000) last year was only fatal in two cases. '1 he prevalence of scarlet fever in London during the year 1894 showed a very marked decline, 18,446 cases being notified against 36,901 during 1893. During the year under notice, 11,767 scarlet fever patients were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals. The mortality in London, which had averaged 0.30 per 1,000 in the preceding ten years, did not exceed 0.21 last year. 4.—Diphtheria (decennial average 14.1 per 1,000). During 1894, 11,186 cases were notified in London, and 4,128 new case3 were removed to the Asylum Board's Hospitals. In St. Giles, the 13 deaths from diphteria in 1894, viz., 4 adults, and 9 children under 5 years, were just below the average ; this to a certain extent is satisfactory, as the prevalence of the disease in London during the past year caused a mortality equal to 0.38 per 1,000. 89 The Lancet, July 21st, 1894, stated that, "the statistics of the General Register Office contain no separate mention of diphtheria until the year 1855, the deaths due to this cause having previously to that date been included under the head of scarlet fever. Up to comparatively i*ecent years it was considered a disease chiefly affecting rural districts. In London, during the past year, the deaths were 2,367, and the death-rate has gone up from 144 per million in 1880, to 760 in 1893. With the view of affording facilities for the early and accurate diagnosis of diphtheria, the General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board adopted the recommendation of their sub-committee as to the establishment of a bacteriological laboratory as a necessary adjunct to the work carried out at the Hospitals, and that immediate steps be taken for giving a fair trial for the adoption of the antitoxin treatment in suitable cases at an early stage of the disease. The General Purposes Committee on the 5th November, 1894, report; — We have ascertained by personal conference with the Medical-Superintendents of the Board's Fever Hospitals that they are desirous of obtaining an adequate supply of anti toxin serum, and that, with the exception of one Medical Superintendent, who had had no diphtheria patient under treatment, they had already individually endeavoured, but in most cases failed, to obtain sufficient for their requirements. We have also directed inquiries to be made of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and the British Institute of Preventive Medicine, with a view of ascertaining whether they would be prepared to supply, and, if so, when, and on what terms, diphtheria anti-toxin for use in the Hospitals of the Board. In a letter dated the 16th instant, the Secretary to the Eoyal College of Physicians and Surgeons states that the Laboratories Committee of those Colleges will be prepared to supply anti-toxin to the Medical Superintendents 90 of the Managers' Hospitals provided the Managers can afford accommodation on one of their farms near to London for the required number of horses, a number which will be governed by the amount of serum required, probably not less than four or more than ten ; will supply the cost of stabling, grooming, and keep, during the time that serum is being supplied by the Committee for the use of the Board; and will pay the fares and incidental laboratory expenses. These fares would merely be those of one or two assistants to and from the farm on three or four days a week, whilst the laboratory expenses would amount to a very small sum. We have carefully considered the proposals of the Royal Oollegess of Physicians and Surgeons, and having regard to all the circumstances and to the fact that the Managers have agreed, as a tentative and temporary arrangement, to accept their offer to carry out the bacteriological investigation of cases of diphtheria admitted to the Board's Hospitals for a period of six months, we unanimously advise— (a) That the Managers be recommended to accept the offer of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons to supply anti-toxin on the terms and conditions set forth in their letter of the 16th instant. (Signed) AUGUSTUS C. SCOYELL, Chairman of the Sub-Committee. 5.—Whooping Cough (decennial average, 23'9). The fatality, in its 29 deaths of young children, was excessive. 6.—Fever (decennial average, 9'3) was also slightly above the average—the 9 deaths from it include one from malarial fever contracted abroad. Again no case of typhus was reported. Enteric fever was slightly less prevalent in London during the year than in 1893. The deaths from fever in all London were 626, including 5 from typhus, this mortality was 0'03 below the decennial average. The Statistical Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board report that during the year 1894— " 17,759 fever, diphtheria, and small-pox patients were removed from their homes to the various hospitals of the 91 managers; 5,159 convalescent patients were transferred to the Northern and Gore Farm Hospitals ; 5,465 recovered patients were brought back to London from the latter hospitals, and 269 patients were removed to other places than the Managers' Hospitals. " Altogether 29,688 removals were effected by the land ambulance service during 1894, and the various vehicles made 19,796 journeys and ran 203,820 miles. " The steamboats of the river ambulance service conveyed 7,614 passengers to and from the hospital ship at Long Reach." Diarrhceal Order. 7.—Diarrhcea (decennial average, 21*1). The 9 deaths, all young children, were the lowest that I can find in any record. The 1,769 fatal cases in all London were little more than half the corrected average, and the death-rate from the disease, compared with the mean mortality in the ten years, showed a marked decline. NOTIFICATION OF DIARRHOEA. The following is a copy of letter received from the Secretary of the Local Government Board :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. July 16th,1894. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that cholera, from which certain parts of Europe have never been entirely free since the summer of 1892, again shows some signs of recrudescence on the Continent. 92 In the late summer and autumn months of 1892 and 1893 the disease reached our shores. In 1892 it failed to extend to any persons beyond those arriving in our midst from abroad, but last year it led to a number of localised outbreaks, which, happily, were of trivial extent compared with previous cholera visitations to this country. In those localities where cholera made some headway it was found that there had been antecedent diarrhoea, generally quite excessive in amount, often choleraic in type; the existence of this unusual diarrhoea being only discovered when diarrhoea was under Section 7 of the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, added to the diseases notifiable under that statute. But notification of diarrhoea was rarely, if ever, adopted until after the advent of cholera, when the information to be derived from it could not be utilised to prevent that disease from gaining a footing whilst in its least recognisable form. Under these circumstances the Local Government Board have thought it advisable to remind Sanitary Authorities that the utmost vigilance should be exercised within their respective districts to control any diarrhoea which may be suspicious either in character or in amount during the present and forthcoming season, and, with a view of facilitating action in this direction, the Board would give favourable consideration to any applications that may be .addressed to them for their approval to add diarrhoea to the list of notifiable diseases until the termination of the current quarter. In making any such application each Sanitary Authority will doubtless consider how far it may be desirable, in the first instance at least, to limit notification of diarrhoea to attacks occurring over one year of age. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) HUGH OWEN, Secretary The Clerk to the Sanitary Authority. This letter was considered at a meeting of the Board, held on Tuesday, the 24th July, when it was ordered that, pursuant to Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with reference to the notification of infectious diseases, shall, as from the 10th August until the 29th day of September next, both days inclusive, apply in the district 93 to the infectious disease known as diarrhoea, where such disease occurs in persons of over one year of age. This resolution was duly advertised, and a copy of the letter sent to all the Medical Practitioners resident or practising in the district. As a consequence of this 98 notifications of diarrhoea were received. Cholera. As cholera again prevailed in 1894, in various parts of the Continent, the Local Government Board issued instructions to the various Sanitary Authorities to organise precautionary measures against the possible introduction of the disease into this country. Accordingly, the several arrangements adopted by your Board in 1893, were ordered to be continued. The same energetic measures were taken by the Port Sanitary Authorities at Greenwich to detect imported cases, and prevent their being conveyed into London. Several notices were received of the arrival of passengers from infected places in Russia, Holland, and Belgium. Upon receipt of the information each person was visited at his place of destination in the District, and found to be in good health. The same precautions were taken at the various Ports of the United Kingdom, and no case of the disease occurred throughout the year. 94 Other Miasmatic DiseaseS. I.—Influenza. The deaths from this disease, which were 10, 31, 29, and in the 4 years 1890, 1891, 1892, and 1893 were 23 in the past year. All the deaths occurred at middle or advanced ages. 14 of the total deaths occurred to inmates of the Workhouse. The mortality in all London was 750 against 2,336, 2,264 and 1,526 in the three preceding years. II.—Constitutional Diseases. The Tubercular diseases belong to this class, and caused 172 deaths, viz.:— Phthisis (consumption) 122 Various forms of Scrofula 50 III.—Diseases of Respiratory System. These diseases of the lungs and air passages were accountable for 148 deaths, viz.:— Bronchitis 108 Pneumonia 39 Asthma 1 The deaths in all London from the same class of diseases were, in the year 1894, below the average by 4,733. 95 IV.—Sudden and Violent Deaths. Inquests. The undermentioned table shows that, during 1894, 80 inquests were held on parishioners, viz., 55 at the Coroner's Court, Goldsmith Street, and 25 at public hospitals, situated outside the District, where the deceased had been removed for treatment. 40 of the deaths occurred from disease, or natural causes. 29 of the deaths resulted from various kinds of accidents. 10 committed suicide. 1 verdict was returned, "homicide, murder."

Sanitary Congress. In July last an important Sanitary Congress, convened by the British Institute of Public Health, under the Presidency of Professor W. R. Smith, was held at King's College, London, for the discussion of various subjects relating to Public Health. As one of your Delegates I attended at the several meetings, and beg to report that the following Resolutions, adopted by the various sections of the Congress, the whole of which (with the exception of those from the Engineering and Building Construction Section, which were referred to the Council by the Institute) were unanimously adopted:— That, while the necessary provision of Block Dwellings for the Housing of the Working Classes is being pushed forward within the Metropolis and other large towns, it is desirable that every effort should also be made to increase the number of Cottage Dwellings in the most accessible suburbs of London and other large towns, especially in connection with the Railway systems. That this Conference instructs the Executive of the British Institute of Public Health to press upon the Government the necessity of making it compulsory on all Local Authorities to provide adequate and suitable Hospital Accommodation for Infectious Diseases, including powers for compulsorily acquiring land. That, in the opinion of this Congress, the Local Government Board is not justified in affording owners and occupiers of land in the vicinity of a site proposed to be purchased by a Public Authority for infectious hospital purposes, any protection beyend that given them by the action of the general law. That Municipal Authorities should be empowered to establish and maintain Winter Gardens, with wholesome entertainments for the people. That the Preventive Medicine Section of the Congress of the British Institute of Public Health, now sitting in London, would suggest to the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board the advantage that would accrue to the Public Health if his Department would collect and publish 99 the salient points bearing upon the proof of the preventibility of Consumption and Tubercular diseases generally (i.e —a summary of our present knowledge of the causation of these diseases), together with practical suggestions as to the details of precautionary measures to be observed by individuals, or to be adopted by public bodies; and if such facts and recommendations were disseminated as widely as possible. That, in the opinion of this joint Conference of the Chemical and Municipal and Parliamentary Sections of the British Institute of Public Health, amendment of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is required in the following, among other, directions:— (1). The modification of the Warranty Defence in such a way as to sure the punishment of the real offender. (2). The appointment of some adequate official scientific authority for the fixing of milk and other standards, and the investigation of analytical methods. (3). The registration of itinerant vendors, and further provision for sampling goods in transit. (4). The requirement of clear and legible Labelling of Mixtures and Impoverished Goods. (5). The clear inclusion in the term "Pood" of such articles as Baking Powders, which, under the law as at present construed, may be so made and sold as to injure the health of the public. That the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the various County Councils have their attention called to the importance to the public of the early recognition and accurate diagnosis of Diphtheria, and that they be asked to afford medical men facilities for obtaining such Bacteriological assistance as may lead to the prompt recognition of the disease. That Municipal Authorities should be empowered to establish and maintain Crematoria. That Testators should be empowered to direct how their bodies are to be disposed of, and executors be compelled to observe such directions. That it i3 desirable in the interests of Public Health that the present permissive action provided in the Public Health Act, 1875, to construct Public Slaughter Houses be made compulsory, and that after the building of such houses notice be given to owners of ail private slaughter houses that at the expiration of two or three years no further slaughtering can be permitted in any but Public Slaughter Houses. That it is desirable that a representation be made to Government that the costs incurred in Port Sanitary Work in seeking to protect the country from the invasion of Cholera should be paid in whole or in part by the State. The following were the recommendations of the Engineering, &c., Section:— That the present want of uniformity in the Regulations and Bye Laws of Local Authorities in relation to Sanitary Construction and Appliances is H 2 100 detrimental to Sanitary progress and injurious to the health of the people, and should therefore he amended. That it is desirable that the Local Government Board should, after oonsultation, frame a model set of Rules and Regulations. That it is important that every Sanitary Inspector should have a practical knowledge of Building Construction, for the reason that as his duty is to see the work properly carried out he cannot fulfil this duty unless he has the trade technical knowledge. That this decision be communicated to the Local Government Board. That the want of uniformity is deeply regretted in the decisions given by judges and magistrates, and it is believed that the only remedy is the appointment by Government of a Special Tribunal, which should deal with all the questions of Building Construction and Sanitary Appliances, and all cases which arise out of building. This Court should consist of at most two Experts sitting with an experienced Barrister, or with one of the Official Referees. That such Court should sit from day to day so that no delay may occur. That such body should be appointed by the Local Government Board. That, while fully recognising the wise application by the Corporation and Authorities of the City of London of the funds in their hands in the building of the Tower Bridge, this Congress cannot but express its hope that Municipal Baths should now engage their attention, and thus remove this stigma from this great city. Such Baths should be built on such a scale as to outvie any Baths in any other town at home or abroad, and it is suggested that if funds are not at present available the Baths might be built in sections exteading over some years. That the Congress desire to call the attention of the Board of Trade to the fact that, while railway cattle trucks are bound to have periodical cleansings, yet Carriages for human beings are outside its control. Having regard to recent scientific im estigations, the Congress suggests some rules should be framed to bring Railway Carriages under at least as much Sanitary control as sheep and cattle now have. That advantages will be attendant upon the adoption of statutory standards of purity of Sewage Effluents, framed to meet the varying conditions under which these effluents are delivered, and that the Local Government Board be invited to fix such standards. That, being strongly of opinion that more information is required on all Sanitary appliances, ventilators, and sewers, and also on matters connected with building construction, the Engineering and Building Construction Section urgently recommend this Congress to appoint a small Standing Committee with power to act until the next Congress. That such Committee, by circular or otherwise, appeal to all Local Authorities throughout Great Britain and Ireland to aid them in the work ; and that they also appeal to the City Companies and to other bodies and individuals for funds for making the necessary scientific researches. That such Committee from time to time make reports of the work they are doing. 101 Meteorology of London, 1894.

CONFERENCE FOR REGULATING BAKEHOUSES. In October a conference of Yestries and District Boards was convened by the Vestry of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark, as to amendment of the law regulating Bakehouses. After considerable discussion the following resolutions were agreed to:— 1. That the present state of the law relating to Bakehouses requires amendment by the addition of the following clauses to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— (a). That uniform Metropolitan bye-laws regulating Bakehouses be made by the London County Council, and be confirmed by the Local Government Board, and that the duty of enforcing these bye-laws shall devolve upon the various Local Sanitary Authorities. (b). That the portions of the bye-laws regulating the structure of Bakehouses do not apply to existing bakeries. (c). That the London County Council be empowered to frame bye-laws for the construction of underground bakehouses. That all bakehouses erected after the passing of such bye-laws shall conform thereto. 106 Sect. 47.—Unsound Food.
