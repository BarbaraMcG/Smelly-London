HENR 4 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SANITARY CONDITION OF The Rural District of London, FOR THE YEAR 1910, BY R. LESLIE ROMER, MR.C.S, Eng., L.R.C.P., Lond. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. London : Warden & Co , Ltd., Printers, "Hendon and Finchley Times" Office, 71, Church Road, Hendon. 1911. The Rural District of London. Area, 11,055 Acres. Estimated Population, 14,940. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen,— I have the honour of presenting you my Annual Report upon the sanitary condition of your District. It is the 16th of the new series, and covers the year 1910. The general sanitary condition of the District is excellent, the death-rate has again fallen from 7.3 per 1,000 last year to 6.2 this. Section X. AREA AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF DISTRICT. The area of the District is 11,055 acres. It lies upon Topographythe southern and western slopes of the spur of high land running from the Barnet District and jutting out into the Weald of Harrow. The dividing lines of the five parishes run approximately north and south, the northern portion of the parishes resting on the hill and the southern lying in the valley. 4 The highest point in the District, 502 feet above Ordnance datum, is on the Watford Road at the Hertfordshire boundary. The lowest point, about 150 feet, is to be found at the south-east corner of Pinner parish. The District is distinctly a residential one, being somewhat heavily timbered, and has a very small acreage of arable land. The agricultural portion of it is laid down in grass, and the chief agricultural product is hay. Running from east to west the parishes come in the order shown in Table A. Geology. The District lies upon the great London clay bed, which is capped on the higher land by patches of gravel of varying thickness. In some places, notably in the north-east corner of Harrow Weald, the subsoil water rises to within a foot or 18 inches of the surface of the gravel. Public Open Spaces. Besides the Stanmore Cricket Ground (seven acres), Stanmore Marsh (14 acres), the Little Common, Stanmore (6¼ acres), and the Pinner Beds (10 acres), the principal Common lands are those of Harrow Weald and Great Stanmore. The area of the former is 34 acres, of the latter 121½ acres. Section 2. I have found some difficulty this year in procuring information as to the number of inhabited houses in the District, although Mr. Webb and Mr. Johnson have given me kind assistance in the matter. I have not applied to the Assistant Overseers, as it is apparently useless, but have based my estimation of the population on the number of inhabited houses last year, plus the new houses built this year, after making allowance for those not occupied. My estimated population therefore is 14,940. 5 The following Table A shews the estimated population to the middle of 1910, together with the deaths and deathrate in each of the five parishes.

Births, 270. † 3 Illegitimate. Birth-rate. 18.07. Infantile Mortality, 40.7. Zymotic Mortality, 0. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. Two hundred and seventy births, of which four were illegitimate, were registered. The numbers for 1908 and 1909 were 251 and 240 respectively. The birth-rate for 1909 was only 16.9, but this year I am glad to see it has risen to 18.07, which is satisfactory, although not so good as the birth-rate for 1908, which was 19.4. DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The number of deaths registered in the District was 78, as against 91 last year. Three of these died in the Cottage Hospital. 6 Principal Causes of Death. The County Medical Officer has again kindly sent me a list of 13 people who died in public institutions outside the District, while there were three deaths in the Bushey Heath Hospital, which Dr. Gruggen kindly notified to me. There were no deaths of non-residents. The corrected number of deaths after adding the sixteen deaths of residents occurring outside the district is 94, which gives a death-rate of 6.29. Diseases of the respiratory organs caused 23 deaths, namely:—Phthisis, 11; Bronchitis, 9; Pneumonia, 2; Pleurisy, 1. Last year there were 10 deaths from Phthisis, 10 from Bronchitis, and 4 from Pneumonia. There were no deaths from any of the Zymotic Diseases. Cancer caused 11 deaths, the age and the sex being:— Male: 51, 70, 68, 77=4. Female: 77, 75, 71, 64, 54, 45, 80 = 7. Last year there were three male and seven female. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The number of deaths of infants under one year still remains satisfactorily low, the number registered this year being only 11. In 1908 and 1909 the numbers were 20 and 9, respectively. The death-rate this year is 40.7 as against 37.5 last year, and 79.6 in 1908. PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. There was not a single death under this heading, a fact which speaks very highly for the sanitary condition of the District. 7 Section 3. Only fifteen cases of infectious disease were notified this year. Such a low number has never been recorded before in this District. The number for last year was 54, and for 1908, 36. Of the 15 notified this year, 10 were Scarlet Fever, 2 Diphtheria, 1 Erysipelas, 1 Enteric, and 1 a supposed case of Small Pox, which proved to be an extraordinarily severe case of Chicken Pox. Of the Scarlet Fever cases, 6 were notified from Great Stanmore, 3 from Harrow Weald and Pinner, and 1 from Little Stanmore. There were no fatal cases. Two cases of Diphtheria were notified, both from Pinner. In the one case of Enteric, it was impossible to trace the source of infection. Public Health Tuberculosis Regulation Act 1908. PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS. Three cases in all were notified last year; one by the Poor Law Officer, and two voluntarily. In each case the premises were visited and disinfected by Mr. Johnson, the Sanitary Inspector. Section 4. ISOLATION HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION. The accommodation of this hospital consists of 20 beds and cots. Considering the extraordinarily small amount of infectious disease in the district this year it may seem absurd that I should again draw your attention to the want of an observation ward at the Isolation Hospital. But this low incidence of infectious disease cannot possibly last; indeed at the present time of writing, both Scarlet Fever wards are occupied, and 8 there is therefore no place in which to isolate any possible case of mixed infection that may occur, except the ward kitchen. Also, in this connection, may I remind you that the area which this hospital serves has been increased since we admitted Wembley cases? The road to the hospital has been much improved, since the old rough corduroy road, which jolted the patients terribly, has been done away with and a new road made up. There is no accommodation for Small Pox. Section 5. GENERAL SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND ADMINISTRATION. Houses and Housing Accommodation There have been built during the year 41 houses in Edgware, 15 in Little Stanmore, 11 in Great Stanmore, 22 in Harrow Weald, and 232 in Pinner, making a total of 321 for the district. Overcrowding. Four cases of overcrowding have been satisfactorily dealt vith. Common Lodging Houses. One common lodging house is registered in Little Stanmore. No contraventions found. Houses Let in Lodgings. Bye-laws have been adopted. Pig Keeping, and Manure M idd ens. There are no Bye-laws respecting the keeping of pigs. I still think this is a mistake. Moveable Dwellings. Forty-three vans have been inspected this year. There were three nuisances abated and three caravans were removed from the District. 9 Water Supply. The Colne Valley Water Company supplies 99 per cent, of the houses in the District with a plentiful and pure water. There are very few private wells in the District. During the year one of these was closed as unfit for drinking purposes. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal. There are now very few houses in the District which are unconnected with the sewer. Slaughter Houses. There are nine on the register, which are frequently visited. Two contraventions of the regulations were found, and dealt with. These slaughterhouses being scattered, are with difficulty efficiently inspected by one Inspector. Owing to the uncertain times of killing, it is as a rule impossible for Mr. Johnson to be present when the carcases are being dressed. Unsound Food. Information was received that a sample of milk taken from a farm in Pinner was found to be tuberculous. The animals were tested by a Veterinary Surgeon, and a cow was found to tuberculous. The animal was killed, and the carcase afterwards buried in lime. The carcase of another tuberculous cow was seized in Stanmore and disposed of, after I had inspected it. A "fluky" liver was discovered, which had been sold by a butcher. A cautionary letter was sent. The inspection of food and drugs for adulteration 's carried out by the County Council. Cowsheds. There are 38 cowsheds on the Register. One hundred and fifty-five inspections have been made, and eighteen contraventions of the regulations found. Inspection takes place every six months, and some more frequently, as occasion requires. One cowkeeper was requested to apply for registration. An application to be registered was made by a person in Pinner, but the premises being unsuitable, the application was refused. Several repairs have been carried out, such as relaying porous and defective floors. 10 Milk and Milk Supply. The milk supply of the district is, on the whole, good. I have had, however, some complaints, that the milk is dirty. This I have generally found due to insufficient straining. Where the milk is sold in bottles it is perfectly clean and wholesome. As mentioned above, one case of tuberculous milk was discovered. Last year there was a similar case, when milk found to be tuberculous in London, was traced to Edgware. How much tubercular milk is produced in this District it is impossible to say, as the examination of milk is not in my hands, but in that of the County Council. Unless, and until, the dairy-herds are inspected systematically by veterinary surgeons, the milk supply of the country will be a hidden source of danger to the population. Milch Cows. There are 446 milch cows in the District. M ilk Shops and Dairies. There are 32 milkshops on the register. Offensive Trades. There are none in the District. Collection of House Refuse This work is done by contract. During the early summer your Council decided that the dust-bins should be disinfected with Jeye's Corporation Powder. The refuse from Pinner is mostly disposed of at the Eastcote Brickfields, and some at a place near Watford. That from Stanmore is taken to the Sewage Farm and burnt. The Harrow Weald dust is tipped in various places. The refuse from Edgware and Little Stanmore is burnt in a field adjoining Bacon Lane, Edgware. Two complaints were made of refuse being tipped so as to become a nuisance. The nuisance was abated on the contractor being informed. Seventy-four written complaints, and many verbal ones, were made on the non-removal of house refuse, principally in the Pinner district, at the commencement of the present contracts. Notices were sent to the contractor. 11 Mortuary Accommodation. Nuisances. Chief among the nuisances, is that arising from untrapped sink waste pipes. The usual arrangement is that a straight pipe is taken from the sink and made to discharge over an open-air gully. This length of pipe gets lined with fat, which decomposing, causes a most poisonous gas. At certain times this foul gas is blown into the house, and causes very severe blood poisoning to the inmates. I should strongly recommend that you should adopt a Bye-law making it compulsory for all such drains to be trapped close under the sink by an "S" tube. I have likewise found another grave defect in the position of the ventilating shaft of the soil pipe. Under the present regulations this pipe must be carried above the eaves of the roof, but most builders are quite content to fulfil the letter of the law only, and on more than three occasions I have traced the cause of the illness of some of the inmates to the ventilating shaft which was discharging sewer gas into the open dormer window of a room. The ventilating shaft should in all cases be carried up the roof so as to discharge its foul air well above the window of any bedroom. Eighteen broken dust-bins have been replaced by new ones. There is one public mortuary at Pinner, situated in the Churchyard. The Cottage Hospital and Isolation Hospital of Stanmore have each a mortuary of their own. The sanitary work of the District grows steadily heavier. The testing of drains, together with the supervision of repairs, naturally takes time. In all the drainage of 118 houses was examined, and it was found necessary to reconstruct the drains in 34 cases, whilst most of the others were found to be more or less defective, and were repaired. 12 During the year 1877 inspections and 1222 re-inspections have been made. Three hundred and sixty-two nuisances were found and dealt with. Only ten statutory notices were necessary, the remainder being dealt with by letters and interviews. A temporary building situated in Waxwell Lane, Pinner, and used as a dwelling house was closed under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, as unfit for human habitation. Ninety-one premises were cleansed or repaired, some of them being in a bad state. Several complaints were received of persons depositing garden refuse in places so as to become a nuisance. These were all dealt with, but it was difficult to find the person responsible. If everybody burnt or buried their garden refuse, great annoyance would be saved to the public. The nuisance arising at Canons Park has this year been finally dealt with, and the sewerage completed and connected with the sewer in the High-road, Edgware. The sewer was extended to Whitchurch Rectory to enable the drains to be connected therewith. The sewer was extended from the "Hare" Public House to the corner by Harrow Weald Park in order to take the drains of two houses and four cottages. Twenty-six foul ditches and ponds were cleansed; 8 nuisances from foul animals abated; 12 yards paved or repaired and 20 cases of dampness remedied. House to House Inspection. Under the Housing and Towns Planning Act, 1909, a systematic house to house inspection was begun on the lines laid down by the Local Government Board in an Order dated September 2nd, 1910. 13 The work has gone on slowly as yet owing to the pressure of other work. In all 51 inspections have been made and in no case has a closing order been asked for or made. The various defects found have been dealt with under the Nuisance Clauses of 1875. Factories, Bakehouses and Workshops. There are 10 factories and 17 workshops on the register, to which 59 visits were made and 5 contraventions found. As before, the Sanitary Tables at the end of this report are compiled by Mr. Johnson. I wish to thank him for his willing and able assistance to me during the past year. The work every year is becoming heavier, the house to house inspections under the Housing and Town Planning Act alone entailing a large amount of extra work. As I have pointed out, it is necessary, in my opinion, to give Mr. Johnson some assistance, even if it only be unskilled labour. The necessary sanitary work at any rate would thereby b:) lightened and give more time for him in his many inspections of houses, dairies, slaughter houses, etc. ISOLATION HOSPITAL. Cases: 36. Deaths: 0. During the past year 36 cases were treated and there were no deaths, I am glad to say. Of these 34 were Scarlet Fever, and the remaining two were Diphtheria. Three of Scarlet Fever and one of Diphtheria remained over from 1909. Thirty-two fresh cases were admitted, 31 of which were Scarlet Fever. This is a decrease of 22 from last year's admissions. 14 At the end of the year 4 Scarlet Fever cases still remained in Hospital. Most of the cases were mild in character, and gave no cause for anxiety. I have to thank Miss Streeter and the staff for their unremitting attention to the patients under their charge. The children are all so happy and look so well at the end of their convalescence that it is a striking testimony to the care that has been bestowed upon them. I wish also to thank Mr. Webb for his kindness in repairing the road to the Hospital, which had been badly cut up during the bad weather by the carting of the new clinkers for the Sewage Farm. Thanking you for your kindness and courtesy to me during the past year, I am, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, E. LESLIE ROMER. 15 I Institutions within the District receiving sick and infirm persons from outside the District. II.
