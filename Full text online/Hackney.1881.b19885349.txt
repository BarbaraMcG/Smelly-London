HAc 61 Board of Works for the Hackney District. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the HACKNEY DISTRICT, FOR THE YEAR 1881, by JOHN W. TRIPE, M.D., Member of the Royal College of Physicians, Edin., &c.; President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; Secretary and formerly President of the Meteorological Society; Member of Council of the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research, and of the Society of Public Analysts; and Foreign Member of the Sociètè Française d'Hygiène; Author of Essays on Scarlatina, Meteorological Phenomena in connection with Disease, on Sanitary Statistics, &c.; Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for the District. LONDON: A. T. Roberts, Son & Co. Printers, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1882. REPORT FOR 1881. TOWN HALL, HACKNEY, April 24th, 1882. In my last Report I very briefly referred to the population and number of inhabited houses in this large district, and showed that there had been an increase of about 61,000 inhabitants, and of more than 8,000 inhabited houses. I was unable to compare the returns from other Parishes and Districts as they were not then published, but I am now able to lay before you some account concerning them. The last Census shows that the increase in the resident population of London has occurred chiefly in the outskirts, as the great centres of business are now not occupied at night by most of those who carry on their professions, and even trades, in or near the centre of London. Thus, in the City of London the night population has, during the years 1861-81, diminished to the extent of 54.8 per cent.; in the Strand District it has decreased as much as 30.5 per cent., in St. Giles' 16.3 per cent., in Westminster 11.9 per cent., and in many others a decrease has also occurred, but to a lesser extent. The dimunition in St. Giles' and some other Metropolitan Parishes has, however, partly arisen from the number of houses, either unfit for human habitation or required for improvements, which have been pulled down during this period. The day population of the City has, however, increased in nearly the same proportion as the night population has decreased, as between 1866, when a day census was taken by the City authorities, and December, 1881, when 4 another day census was made, there has been an increase of no less than 53.4 per cent. The day population of the City of London is stated to have been in December, 1881, no less than 261,061, against a night population of 50,526, so that more than 200,000 persons engaged there during the day are nonresident. On the other hand the population of Hackney is to a very great extent resident, but supplies a considerable proportion of the day population of the City. As regards its population, Hackney stands sixth on the list amongst Metropolitan parishes and districts, or seventh if the day population of the City be considered as its true number. Islington heads the list with 282,628 night residents, whilst Lambeth had 253,569, St. Pancras, 236,209, Wandsworth, 210,397, Camberwell, 186,555, Hackney, 186,400, and Kensington, 162,924. Hackney does not, however, stand so high as regards rateable value, being tenth in order with the large assessment of £1,146,290; whilst it stands fourth on the list as regards inhabited houses with 27,503 against 35,082 in Lambeth; 34,048 in Islington ; 30,754 in Wandsworth ; 27,306 in Camberwell, and as many as 24,898 in the City of London, so that there only two persons in each house in the City at night against 6.78 persons in Hackney. The population of the Hackney District in 1851 was 58,429, and in 1881 was returned at 186,400, showing an increase in the number of our residents of no less than 127,971 persons. By far the greatest part of this increase has been caused by immigrants, as the excess of births over deaths, that is to say the natural increase of the population in the thirty years, was only 44,559 out of the 127,971. In addition to these there have been very many losses from removals to other districts, so that the present population has received not only a net increase of 83,412 persons by immigration, but a sufficient number also to balance the emigration. The statistics of Islington, Kensington, Camberwell, Wandsworth and other suburban districts must show a similar state of things, so that the diminution of 5 population in many country places, as well as in the City is readily accounted for. To a certain extent the low death rate of all London, and especially of its suburbs, is caused by the immigration of young persons between 15 and 35 years of age, at which age comparatively few die as compared with the population at all ages.

As I have already referred to the increase of the population of this District since 1851, I have not much to add on that point in discussing the table now under consideration, which is one of those annually laid before you. It will be seen that the increase during the 10 years, 1872-81, has been nearly 60,000 or almost 50 per cent., which, considering the large number in 1872, was scarcely to have been expected. If the same rate of increase of our present population be maintained, there will be nearly 270,000 inhabitants in 1891. This calculation is probably in excess 6 of what the number will be, but such a result would be by no means unexpected. The density of population is now getting considerable, being as large as 47.8 per acre, without allowing for the Marshes and other spaces which cannot be built on, which amount, including water, to 467 acres. If these be deducted the density of population would be 54.2 per acre, so that we can scarcely hope for the death-rate remaining much longer so low as it has hitherto been. The number of births was a very little in excess of those for 1880, having been 6,377 against 6,371 in 1880, and the birth-rate per 1,000 population was only 33.9, being less than any year since 1873. The number of deaths, after due allowance has been made for those of residents of this District in extraneous hospitals was 3,614 against 3,321 in 1880, which was a singularly healthy year. TABLE II.

It will be seen that Hackney Sub-District, as might have been expected from its large population, viz. 76,886, considerably heads the list, but it must be remembered that as the Hackney Union and the City of London Union Workhouses, the Homerton Fever and Small Pox Hospitals, and the German Hospital are in this Sub- 7 Division, the proportion of births to population would necessarily bo below the mean for the whole District. The next largest number of births, viz. 1,380, was registered in South Hackney, and the next in West Hackney, viz. 1,291. Stoke Newington again shows an increase in the number of births, as there were 776 registered in this year against 706 in 1880. There was also a slight increase in Stamford Hill, viz. 330 against 312. The percentages of births in the Sub-Districts to the total number in the whole District were 12.2 in Stoke Newington, 5.2 in Stamford Hill, 20.2 in West Hackney, 40'8 in Hackney, and 21.0 in South Hackney; so that, with the exception of Ilackney Sub-District, which is somewhat larger, the percentages are nearly the same as those for last year.

For instance, the true number of deaths cannot be known even by distribution of deaths and population in Hospitals and Workhouses, unless the Sub-Districts from which persons dying in the Hackney Workhouse, and in the Hospitals, not only in Hackney but in all London were ascertained. As compared with last year there 8 was an excess of deaths in Stoke Newington, West Hackney, Hackney and South Hackney, but a dimunition in Stamford Hill. The excess of deaths in the Hackney Sub-District arose chiefly from the unusual number of deaths from small pox, of inhabitants of all the Sub-Districts, in the Homerton Hospital. The greatest number of deaths occurred in the fourth quarter, and the smallest in the first which is somewhat unusual. TABLE IV.

Now, considering the large number of deaths from small pox in the District, this is 9 satisfactory. By far the most fatal age period was 0-5 years, as no less than 555 deaths from zymotic diseases were registered during the first five years of life against 277 at all ages above 5 years. These deaths were caused chiefly by small pox, measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough and diarrhoea, and especially by the last named disease and measles. The total mortality under 5 years was high, viz. 42.7 per cent, of the whole, but it was smaller than in 1880, when it was 44'8 per cent. It was also in excess of the mean for the 10 years 1866-75 by as much as 2'7 per cent. The percentage of deaths from zymotic diseases to total deaths was 25.7; from constitutional diseases, i.e. gout, dropsy, cancer, consumption, water on the brain and mortification, 16.0 percent.; from local diseases, i.e. from inflamatory and other diseases, except tubercular, affecting various organs of the body, viz. the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, &c., the percentage was 44.1 per cent.; from developmental diseases, viz. premature birth, old age, atrophy and debility it was 11.6 per cent., and from violent deaths 2.6 per cent., which was less than usual. The ages at death were as follows—23.0 per cent, of the deaths from all causes occurred under 1 year of age; 19.7 per cent, between 1 and 5 years of age; 6.5 per cent, between 5 and 15; 5.5 per cent, between 15 and 25; 6.7 per cent, between 25 and 35 and between 35 and 45 years of age; 6.6 per cent, between 45 and 55; 71 per cent, between 55 and 65; 10.3 per cent, between 65 and 75; 6.6 per cent, between 75 and 85, and 13 per cent, above 85 years of age. There were 143 deaths above 80 years of age, or nearly 4 per cent, of the whole. Of these 36 occurred between 80 and 81 years of age; 10 between 81 and 82; 20 between 82 and 83; 18 between 83 and 84; 15 between 84 and 85; 9 between 85 and 86, and the same number between 86 and 87; 8 between 87 and 88; 3 between 88 and 89, and 5 between 89 and 90. There were 10 deaths above 90 years of age, viz. 3 at 90-91; 2 at 91-2; 2 at 93-94; 2 at 94-95; and 1 at 98 years of age. There was not any death at 100 or upwards. There was an unusual number of deaths from small 10 pox at advanced ages, as 6 persons were registered as having died from this disease between 63 and 75, and 1 above 75 years of age. There was also the death of an infant only 14 days old registered from whooping cough, which, however, I think must have been an error. There was also 1 death registered as having occurred from vaccination, the return of death was as follows—vaccination, 1 month; erysipelas, 3 weeks; abscess, 2 weeks; congestion of lungs, 2 weeks. It is a question, therefore, if the death of this child, aged 7 months, was not caused by the last named disease. TABLE V.

As already stated, the mortality from zymotic diseases, except as regards infants under 1 year, was above the average. This table shows that the death-rate per 1,000 population was 4.82 from the diseases included under the heading "Order 1" of the Registrar General, against 3.37 in 1880. Some of the affections included under this heading are certainly not zymotic, but for purposes of comparison they will suffice. On the other hand the proportion of deaths from tubercular diseases and from wasting diseases of infants, was below the average, and especially the former; but from convulsive diseases of infants the mortality 11 was unusually high. It is satisfactory to find that tubercular diseases did not cause so large a death-rate as usual. TABLE VI. Deaths from the Seven Chief Zymotic Diseases in 1871-80, in Hackney.

The Registrar General returns the numbers for 1877 at 183 and for 1881 at 236. The difference may arise from deaths in the Highgate Hospital not reported to me by the friends of the patients. The average annual number of deaths from small pox in 1871-80 was 96, which gives 6.6 deaths per 10,000 population. In 1881 the mean number of deaths from small pox per 10,000 population was no less than 11.95. The mean annual number of deaths per 10,000 from each of the other six zymotic diseases in the 10 years, 1871-80, and in 1881 was as follows—from measles 3.3 in 1871-80 and 7.94 in 1881; from scarlet fever 5.1 and 6.26 respectively; from diphtheria 1.2 in 1871-80, and as many as 324 in 1881. From whooping cough the mean number of deaths in the 10 years was 6.4 per 10,000 population against 3.7 in 1881. This is a very excessive mortality from whooping cough during the 10 years, larger in fact than from small pox or any other zymotic disease except diarrhoea, which was 8.3 per 10,000 population per annum against 7.17 in 1881. The mortality from fever was also less in 1881 than the average, having been 3.4 against 37 in 1871-80. Although the death-rate from the seven chief zymotic diseases in Hackney was high, it was decidedly smaller than for all London, as in the 10 years, 1871-80, the mean annual mortality was 34.6 per 10 000 inhabitants in Hackney against 38'5 for all London. 13 As the excessive mortality from whooping cough is to a great extent preventable, it is lamentable that so many deaths, and such great injury to the lungs of many who survive should arise, partly from want of knowledge and partly from carelessness. As I mentioned some years ago in one of my reports, if ohildren were kept indoors during the early stage of whooping cough, especially in cold weather, inflamatory complications would comparatively rarely arise, and the number of deaths would be greatly reduced. But there is another cause of the frequency of whooping cough, viz. the exposure of children affected with the disease in omnibusses, railway trains, schools, dispensaries and hospitals. It is not generally known that whooping cough is infectious in an early stage of the disease, indeed before the whoop is manifest, so that in the case of schools the damage is often done before any danger of infection is suspected. At any rate no child should be exposed in any public place or vehicle; or in any school, hospital or dispensary, when it is known to be suffering from this disease. As whooping cough is not usually considered to be included amongst the dangerous infectious diseases, although I have no doubt that it belongs to that class, I shall apply to the Sanitary Committee for authority to prosecute the person in charge of the sick whenever a case conies to my knowledge of such exposure within this District in a railway train or public conveyance, where the sufferer is kept in the vicinity of healthy persons for some considerable time. 14 TABLE VII, Showing the decennial mean numbers in the years 1841-80, of the births and deaths; of the ratios of births to deaths; of births to population; of deaths under 1 yeah to total births; of deaths from "all causes," and from the seven most fatal zymotic diseases to 1000 population; also the same for each year during 1872-81, Years.

The 15 mean annual number of deaths has increased since 1841-50 from 946 to 2,956 in 1871-80, and 3,614 in 1881. In 1856 the number of deaths registered in Hackney was only 1,508, against the 3,614 in 1881. The number of births to population has diminished, having been only 33.9 per 1,000 residents against 35.l last year, and 33.2 in 1873, to which year we must go back for so small a birth-rate as in 1881. The proportion of deaths under 1 year to total births is very satisfactory, as it was only 130 per 1,000 births, against 142 in the 10 years 1872-81, 143 in 1861-70, and 128 in 1851-60. As the density of population increases, the proportion of deaths under 1 year to total births must be expected to increase slightly, but the year 1881 was unusually favourable to infantile life, as in all London the proportion of deaths to 1,000 births was only 148 against 158 in 1871-80. The annual death-rate per 1,000 population was also low, in spite of the excessive number of deaths from small pox, measles, scarlet fever, diphtheria and diarrhoea. It is, therefore, very evident that the presence of an epidemic of one or even more of these diseases does not, as I have pointed out in former Reports, exercise so large an influence on our death-rate as the continuance of excessive cold or heat, or the frequent occurrence of fogs for a few weeks. Improvements in the sanitary condition of a locality diminish the death-rate by improving the general health of the population, and enabling persons to resist, to a certain extent, the injurious effects of vicissitudes of weather, and probably the poisons of zymotic diseases. There may, perhaps, be at present nearly as many attacks of disease, but the power of resistance being increased, the number of deaths becomes less. The mean annual death-rate for 1881 was only 19.2 per 1,000 population, after due allowance had been made for the deaths of residents of the District in hospitals, against a mean of 19.6 in the 10 years, 1871-80,. 20.4 per 1,000 in 1861-70, and of the 19.14 per 1,000 in 1851-60. The death-rate in all London was higher, viz. 21.2 per 1.000 population, which shows that Hackney still retains its superiority for healthiness over most of the other Metropolitan Parishes and Districts. 16 As I have previously mentioned there was an outbreak of diphtheria and malignant sore throat in various parts of the District, causing 61 deaths, 49 of which was certified as being from diphtheria. There were altogether 71 cases reported, of which 38 occurred in the same number of houses, 20 in 10 houses, 9 in 3 houses, and 4 in 1 house, so that the disease was confined to one case in a house in a little more than one-half of the whole. This shows the disease to be decidedly infectious, and points to the necessity for the removal of the sufferers to a hospital. There is, however, this difficulty as regards the exeroise of such a power by the Sanitary Department, that we rarely receive any notifications of the existence of this disease, exoept from the Death Register, or when a second case has occurred in the same house. There is also another drawback to removal, viz. the rapidity of the disease, which often renders removal unsafe for the patient a few hours after its onset. Three cases were removed, viz. 1 to the London Hospital, and 2 to the Fever Hospital at Homerton, and they are also received at the London Fever Hospital, so that there is no difficulty on that point. In most instances when two or more cases occurred in a house, the spread of the disease was caused by direct infection. Thus at a house in the Broughton Road, a child, aged 5 years, first contracted the disease, and the mother who attended the child caught it a few days afterwards. At another house in the Ballance Road, the grandmother who nursed a child 8 years old, took the disease and died. The elder of two brothers residing in Kingsland caught the disease from the younger, and the same is said to have occurred with two sisters in the Enfield Road. The mother of two children in Tottenham Road, who nursed them, was infected and died 10 days after the death of the child who first contracted the disease. There were other similar cases, which need no special mention. The disease was not prevalent in the early part of the year, as it was not until some cases occurred in the Tottenham Road Board School, that it became at all frequent. Two deaths 17 were reported to me at the end of September, and on making enquiry, it was found that both the children had attended this school, which, as they did not live even in the same road, pointed to the school as the source of infection. On making enquiry it was found that several other children had died or were ill, concerning whom there had not then been any return, so that the disease had got a hold before I knew anything about it. I made an inspection of the school, and found that the rain water pipes opened near to the windows of the infant school in which the disease occurred, and that offensive drain smells had been noticed in this room. These pipes were immediately cut off from the drains, when the disease ceased as regards the scholars, but remained a little longer in the neighbourhood. There were a few other cases amongst scholars, but they appear to have taken it from other sources. For instance, a child of six years who went to the school, was attacked with it three days after the death of a young sister aged 2 years, who did not attend any school. The next outbreak in connection with a school was more limited affecting six children. I carefully inspected the drainage arrangements in this school also, when four rain-water pipes were found to be connected with the drains, and there was a bell trap in the yard. The pipes were immediately disconnected from the drains, and a yard gulley trap substituted for the bell trap, when the disease disappeared. The whole of these deaths occurred between the 11th and 29th of November. In consequence of these outbreaks, all the School Board and other large Schools in this District were examined carefully as to the sanitary arrangements, which were found more or less defective in nearly all. The necessary works as regards better paving, drainage, ventilation and privy accommodation have been carried out. The water supply was of course examined in all instances.

I desire, however, to say that as regards Small Pox Hospitals, I believe they are almost certain to exert a more or less prejudicial influence on the health of the inhabitants of their neighbourhood, if more than 100 patients are admitted, and that, therefore, more than that number should not be treated on one site, except in a great emergency, and that, under any circumstances whatever, the number should be absolutely limited to 150. Also there should not be more than 25 patients to an acre, with a space of at least 150 feet between the wards and the surrounding wall. That all the offices and the dwelling of the medical officers and others, should be outside the walls; that if fever and small pox be treated on one site, there should be two entrances, and that there shoidd be a gateway into which the ambulances could be driven whilst waiting for admission. I would also express my opinion that the infection of this disease can be earned by the air as well as by articles of clothing; but when the number of patients treated in a hospital is small, judging from what has happened in this District, I believe that infection by air is comparatively rare. When a large number (above 140) were in the Homerton Hospital, the risk was apparently increased even in a greater proportion than the number of patients. The repeated outbreaks in Templar Road, Clifden Road, Holmbrook Street and Brooksby's Walk, and the time of their occurrence, can only be explained on this supposition. The endemic of small pox in the vicinity of Wellington Street, Shacklewell, was very severe, although it lasted less than 2 months. The outbreak occurred first in the person of a child, who was attended by a private practitioner, at No. 6, Wellington Street, in December, 1880, convalescence having taken place about the 20th. There were two families in the house. The disease broke out suddenly 20 at the end of December, so that I received notice on January 3rd and 4th that cases had occurred at Nos. 20, 35, 7 and 1, Wellington Street; as well as at No. 1, Hindle Street; 1, Middle Street; and 8, John Street. The whole of these streets are contiguous, and the children were all said to have visited at No. 6, Wellington Street. On January 6th, a case occurred at No. 31, and also at 130, Shacklewell Lane. On the 10th other children were attacked at 6, Wellington Street, as well as on the 12th and 13th, making altogether no less than 9 cases in this house. On the 12th another case occurred at 1, Hindle Street; 5, Wellington Street; 3, Brown's Place; and 4, John Street. On the 13th at 10, Wellington Street; on the 14that 1, Hindle Street (3rd case); on the 17th at 51, Shacklewell Lane; on the 24th at 5, Wellington Street; on the 26th at 3, Wellington Street, and 5, Wellington Place. On February 10th two fresh cases occurred at 3, Brown's Place; on the 12th at 6, Hindle Street; on the 17th at 4 and 9, Shacklewell Row; on the 24th at 4, John Street; on the 22nd at 110, Shacklewell Green; on the 24th at 6, 10, and 16, Brown's Place, which terminated the epidemic, although another case happened at 1, Hindle Street on March 1, and another on the 22nd at 29, Wellington Street. The whole of these cases were removed as soon as possible to the Hospital, and the houses and infected articles of clothing and bedding disinfected, with I think most satisfactory results. It will be seen that the first child attacked was convalescent about 20th December, that the first outbreak (as shown by the rash) occurred on January 3rd and 4th. That cases kept on occurring in different houses, except No. 6, where the child was treated at home, within less than a fortnight after one another, indicating direct infection, until it was stamped out in Wellington Street. On the 8th another outbreak took place in Brown's Place, which is near to Wellington Street, and the children were removed on the 10th. Three other cases occurred in this place on the 24th, which were removed immediately, and the disease ceased. Cases occurred at 1, Hindle Street on January 4th, 12th, 14th and March 1st. 21 The disease was also carried to a distance by a child living at No. 6, who, when apparently well, was removed to a friend's rooms, and infected five other children in the buildings to which he was taken. The total number of reported cases which were caused by the one child treated at home in No. 6, was no less than 52. This is instructive, as showing the difference as to persistence of the disease in the vicinity of the Hospital, where we can never stamp out the disease, whereas it was got under here in less than two months. There was a severe outbreak in 1871 and a slight one in 1877 in some of these streets, which are and were then occupied by very poor people with a large number of children, who indiscriminately play with one another in the streets. In Clifden Road, and also in Templar Road, which are near the Hospital, the disease was most rife when the Hospital oontained more than 150 patients, being exceedingly prevalent from early in May, 1881, to August 6th, when the excessive number was reduced to a little more than 100, the largest number in the Hospital during this interval being 347. We could not trace the cases from one to another in Clifden and Templar Roads in the same way as in the streets above named at West Hackney. I would also mention that three outbreaks of small pox occurred in a large establishment where washing was taken in. Besides the ordinary steps for the prevention of the disease which were taken by the Sanitary Staff, the Inspectors distributed above 3,000 bills, recommending re-vaccination amongst the poor, and above 3,000 more were sent to the Clergymen, Schoolmasters and District Visitors, for distribution amongst the Scholars and Inhabitants of their Districts. I also usually advised re-vaccination whenever I visited infected premises. In spite, however, of all these preventive measures, the total deaths from small pox in Hackney in 1881 reached to 119 per 100,000 inhabitants, against 61.8 in all London, so that the death-rate in this District was nearly double that for all London. I have now to lay before you some further information respecting the incidence of small pox at different ages, and 22 especially as regards its relation to vaccination. The total number of cases reported during the epidemic was 1,306; of these 1,075 were said to have been vaccinated, 160 unvaccinated, but no information could bo obtained as to the vaccination in 71 cases. The following table shows that in proportion to the total number of cases amongst those who were reported to have been vaccinated, 6.5 per cent. occurred amongst children under five years of age, the proportion of population at that age being 12.9 per cent. of the whole. That at the age period of 5-10 years the vaccinated cases were 10.9 per cent. against 11.1 per cent. of population; that at 10-15 years of age the percentages were 16.0 of cases against 10 of population; at 15-25 they were 33.9 and 20.4 respectively; at 25-35 years of age there were 192 per cent. of cases and 15.8 per cent. of popidation; at 35-45 years there were only 8.8 per cent. of eases to 11.5 per cent. of population living at that age period. Above 45 years of age there were 18.3 per cent. of population against 4.7 per cent. of cases. I think these figures show most conclusively that unless children have three or more good vaccination marks, they should be re-vaccinated at or before 10 years of age ; indeed I think 7 years is, under these ciroumstances, by no means too early. The greatest proportion of cases amongst the unvaccinated occurred during the first five years of life, as no less than 49.4 per cent. of the total cases amongst these persons reported to me occurred at that age period, whilst 20.6 per cent. happened between 5 and 10 years of age, making 70 per cent. of the whole amongst children under 10 years of age. The contrast of 49.4 per cent. of all the cases amongst the unvaccinated at 0—5 years of age, against 6.5 at the same age amongst the vaccinated, is very striking. 23 Cases of Small Pox at Different Ages in Hackney. vaccinated cases.

All these latter were admittedly un. vaccinated, so that 36, or nearly 20 per cent., were more or less unprotected against an attack of small pox. I took the names and addresses of all the unprotected children and forwarded the list to the Secretary, who induced the parents, including those of the unvaccinated children, to have them vaccinated. I have applied more than once to the School Board Authorities to allow me to examine the children attending their Schools, but have been refused. It must not be supposed that all this bad vaccination or neglect of vaccination, can fairly be thrown on Hackney, as there has been a very large amount of immigration into this District, and to my knowledge very many of the poor children brought into this District are either unvaccinated, or badly vaccinated. I would also mention as evidence of this statement, that the families in which the largest number of cases of small pox occurred, were those of immigrants. During the year I gave a good deal of attention to the smells from the Hackney Wick sewer, and visited all the premises, and several more than once, on which manufacturing processes were carried on, and by a careful examination of the refuse of their operations, satisfied myself that the smell was not in any way 24 caused by refuse poured into the Board's sewers. On the other hand it was evident from the locality where the smells were most intense, and from their nature, that they were caused by sulphur compounds from Berger's Colour Works. The Metropolitan Board of Works, under whose charge the Wick Road sewer is placed by Act of Parliament, took proceedings against Messrs. Berger, after having obtained proof that the offensive refuse came from their works, and I am glad to say that the Board has been successful in compelling Messrs. Berger to decompose and precipitate all the sulphur compounds in a tank before the refuse enters the sewer. Since the precipitating tank has been constructed, and the sulphur deposited in it, all offensive smell has ccased. This result shows that my contention was correct, viz. that it was the duty of the Metropolitan Board of Works to take the steps necessary for the abatement of this abominable nuisance, and not the Hackney Board. Another nuisance arising from effluvia occasionally evolved from Messrs. Barnes' premises at Hackney Wick, but in Bow Parish, will soon be remedied under the provisions of the "Alkali Works Regulation Act," which requires that all makers of certain chemicals named therein, shall make such alterations in their works to the satisfaction of the Local Government Board Inspectors, as are necessary to prevent the works from being an annoyance to the adjoining neighbourhood, by the escape into the air of the injurious gases. There are no manufactures in this District which come under the provisions of this Act, as I have always discouraged the erection of any buildings for offensive businesses. Amongst the unusual occurrences of this year have been the extensive floods in the Hackney Marshes and their vicinity, which rose so high that in March there were 99 premises flooded, and in December no less than 395, the majority of the houses being on the lower part of the Clapton Park Estate. These floodings have added to the labours of the Sanitary Staff, as notices were served on the landlords to remove the accumulations 25 of mud which in many cases had been left by the retiring water. In some premises I visited, where there were semi-basements, the water was from three to four feet deep, and the annoyance was aggravated by the house drains being forced and their contents washed up into the yards. Many of the houses remained damp for a considerable time, especially after the last flood, as it occurred in December, and in some cases they became offensive in consequence of the landlords not removing the the accumulations quickly enough. The floods were not caused by the rainfall in Hackney, as it was less than an inch in 24 hours, but from an overflow of the River Lea, in consequence of the heavy rains in the upper part of its course. The River Lea Conservancy Board and the East London Water Works Company have altered the Channels through which the storm waters passed away, and have thus been indirectly the cause of these injurious overflows, which are likely to recur, unless the efforts made by the Board to obtain alterations in the works executed by these Public Bodies should be successful. Another cause of annoyance to numerous inhabitants and of labour to the Sanitary Staff is the greatly increased number of deposits of vegetable and animal refuse in the avenues behind the houses, and in various open spaces in the District. When fields were near to the houses, and costermongers and gardeners had not far to take the refuse, it was deposited there, bnt now that houses have been built over the fields, refuse is surreptitiously shot in avenues or other places near dwellings. The aid of the inspector of nuisances is, therefore, invoked to remove the accumulations which, as they are often placed on private property, and the owner cannot always be ascertained, a very large amount of trouble is thrown upon the Staff. In several instances I have directed that the freeholder should be served with notice to remove the accumulations, and have been successful, but in many other cases he has denied all responsibility and left us in a difficulty, as there is no rent payable on account of these localities, which are open to the public. The nuisances have, 26 however, in all instances been removed in some way or another, under our notices. During the year the water supply has been cut off from a large number of houses, either for. non-payment of rates in consequence of the landlords neglecting to provide proper fittings in accordance with the approved regulations. As the Water Companies have the power to sue for the rates, or to summon the offending persons for neglecting to supply proper fittings, this action appears to me quite unjustifiable; especially as the persons not in fault suffer more by want of water, than the owner, who only has to pay for his water pipes being again connected with the main. This summary method of procedure, which is often put into force after a very short notice, should in my opinion, be prohibited on sanitary grounds. During the year there has been an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in some of the cowsheds in the District, and in consequence I have examined the milk, both microscopically and chemically, without finding any change, except in one case, when it turned rapidly sour, and became gelatinised in less than 24 hours. There were not any large cells such as are sometimes met with, and I partook of some of the milk without any injurious results. Still, I cannot advise that milk from cows so affected should be used, as the sample which became so quickly putrescent was evidently not fit for human consumption, and pigs are said to die rapidly in convulsions, after partaking freely of this kind of milk. The cowsheds and slaughter houses have been viewed as usual with the result of six licenses being opposed at the Sessions, because the owners did not carry out the orders of the Committee, viz. Mr. J ones, Enfield Road; Mr. Morgan, of Downham Road; Mr. Ottley, of Paradise Place; Mr. Dear, of Lea Bridge Road; Mr. Horning of Pond Lane; Mr. Base, of Chalgrove Road; Mr. Alleson, of High Street, Homerton, and Mr. Matthews, of Wellington Street. The six first named did 27 the whole of the works before the adjourned Sessions in November, so that the opposition was withdrawn, but the licenses for the shed occupied by Mr. Alleson and Mr. Matthews were refused, because the former kept the shed and yard in such a filthy condition as to be a nuisance, and did not make proper dung and grain pits; and the latter because the shed was not properly fitted up for a cow shed. The general condition of most of the sheds was much better than formerly, which might have been expected as every year some objectionable arrangements are removed. The owners of two sheds were also informed that they must either remove or reconstruct them before next licensing day. One butcher's license was also refused. During the year a considerable amount of dissatisfaction has been expressed by persons residing in or adjoining to newly made up roads in consequence of hard core being used in making up the roads instead of dry rubbish, or some other similar material. As many complaints were made of offensive smells being given off by the hard core, I visited some of the streets and reported the result to the Sanitary Committee, who requested the view Committee to visit the dust yards in the District, and ascertain the kind of hard core used for the roads. The inspection showed that the same amount of care in separating the vegetable and other offensive matter was not used at all places, so that the View Committee recommended that the hard core should be disinfected at the yard before being brought to the roads. As a condition to this effect has been inserted in the new contracts, there should not be any similar complaints for the future. The hard core used by builders and others in laying out new estates is often not so good as that which I have seen used in the formation of roads before their dedication, but as the former are rarely very near to inhabited houses, complaints respecting them are rarely made to this Department, but in some instances I have had to interfere with the materials deposited in these roads. 28 During the year my opinion has been asked by several persons proposing to establish some manufactories in the District which would evolve unpleasant if not deleterious vapours, and in all cases I told them, that if the manufactories when established should in any way whatever prove to be a nuisance, proceedings would be taken against them. Under these circumstances the proposed manufactories were not established. I have also taken action against a preparer of sausage skins, who after my inspection, and a communication from me, removed out of the District. Applications were also made to tho Metropolitan Board of Works for newly establishing two slaughter houses, but when the View Committee and myself visited the sites, they were found to be unfit for the purpose, being closely surrounded with houses, and were therefore successfully opposed. Although the number of houses inspected under the provisions of the Sanitary Act was not so large as in former years, yet tho amount of work done, was much greater than usual. This is what might have been expected, as there are three Sanitary Inspectors instead of two. But the number of houses and articles of clothing disinfected was considerably in excess of former years. The table appended shows that during the year there were 1,045 houses disinfected by the Officers of the Board, and the infected rooms subsequently cleansed, whitewashed and re-papered by the owners or occupiers. That 751 beds, 232 mattresses, 46 palliasses, 549 bolsters, 1,204 pillows, 782 blankets, 510 sheets, 424 quilts, and 2,084 other articles were, after fumigation with sulphur, removed to the disinfecting chamber of the Board, and exposed to a temperature of 250° Fahr., and re-sulphured. The total number of articles removed and disinfected was 6,582. These articles were removed as soon as the patients were taken to the hospital or recovered, and it is to this action that I attribute the comparative rarity with which small pox spread through a house when we had early notification of the disease. 29 In consequence of complaints having been made in the latter part of 1880, that the men employed in disinfecting houses were in the habit of stopping at public houses on their way back to the disinfecting chamber, I directed the infected beds, bedding, &o., to be partially disinfected by burning sulphur in the room containing them, before their removal. This plan ought to be uuiversally adopted, as it is much better than the use of a blouse over the clothes, for it is evident as the men have to carry the infected beds into the road before placing them in the truck, that if not previously disinfected, passers by may be infected, and the clothes of the men employed in the work may also become infected. As the position of the old disinfecting chamber was very close to houses, a new one was provided adjoining the Lea Cut. Messrs.

The chief sanitary work performed during the year, besides that ordinarily carried on, consisted in the removal of bell-traps and the substitution of yard gullies; in the disconnection 30 wherever practicable of the sinks from the drains, and the introduction of a P trap under the sink when the waste pipe could not be carried through the wall. Pain-water pipes were also disconnected or trapped when the hopper head was near a window, and the water supply to the closets was disoonneoted from the cisterns, and the overflow pipes cut off from the drains. These last named measures were taken to prevent as far as possible contamination of drinking water with sewer gas. In many instances a draw tap has been connected with the pipe supplying the cistern, to enable the oooupiers of houses to obtain water direct from the main. Most of this work has been done by the additional inspector appointed last year, but all the inspectors have taken an active part in these important alterations. Although very many premises have been thus improved, it will take a considerable time to visit all the houses in the District, and carry out similar alterations. These improvements have been effected on the following number of premises, viz. 2,720 bell traps were removed and yard gullies substituted on 1,991 premises; 1,533 sinks were cut off from the drains or trapped underneath the sinks; 1,299 stack pipes were cut off or trapped in 1,299 houses, and the water supply apparatus was improved in 401 houses. In addition to these 712 choked or defective drains were opened, cleansed and repaired or relaid; 203 yards were properly drained, and as many as 978 re-paved, and 1,990 houses were whitewashed, cleansed and repaired. The total number of nuisances arising from defective means of drainage was 5,968; of nuisances from defects in houses, 3,805; of houses disinfected, 1,343; and of other nuisances abated, nearly 500. There were no less than 12,197 notices served on, and a very much larger number of visits paid to premises in the District, in order to obtain the abatement of these nuisances. In addition, 2,969 requests to have dust and other house refuse removed, were attended to; 82 dead bodies were received into the mortuary; 116 cowsheds were visited several times during the year; 109 bakehouses were inspected; 259 greengrocers, poulterers and fishmongers' yards visited, and all nuisances found thereon 31 removed, and many slaughter houses were also examined. This amount of work could not have been done in any former year, as the staff was too small for the requirements of the District; indeed, if the examination of all houses as regards the means of drainage and water supply is to be quickly done, another inspector for that purpose must be appointed. It will be noticed that amongst the places inspected there are 107 bakehouses mentioned. These were examined not under the powers of the "Bakehouses Regulation Act," as that was repealed by the new "Factory Act," but under the general powers conferred on the Sanitary Authority and its Officers by the "Sanitary Act," as regards the inspection of premises wherever nuisances are known or suspected to exist. The bakehouses were found to be in a similar condition, certainly not better, than they were before the Inspectors of Factories were empowered to issue notices for their being kept in a cleanly and wholesome condition. There were no waterclosets or cases of bad drainage found in the bakehouses. In the Appendix will be found a list of the streets inspected dining the year, from which it will be seen that 4,990 houses were examined, and the rooms, staircases and water closets, the drains and water supply apparatus, as well as the conditions of the yard as to paving and drainage were ascertained, and notices served for the removal of the nuisances found in 3,968 houses. In a large proportion of these the means of drainage received special attention. These houses contained 23,492 rooms, 7,421 families, and 32,651 inmates. All these houses were inspected without any complaint being received, so that a considerably larger number was visited by the inspectors. As many as 798 cases of small pox were reported from these houses, out of a total of 1,146 cases in the whole of the District. There occurred in these houses 175 cases of scarlet fever, 27 of diphtheria, 60 of typhoid fever, and 2 of other fevers. As the total number of eases of diphtheria reported was 56, there was a larger proportion of these cases amongst the inhabitants of better class houses, than of small pox. 32 Table of Sanitary Work, January, 1856 to March 30, 1882 Year.

It shows that since the passing of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," there have been 5,331 cesspools emptied and filled up, and proper water closets erected and connected with the sewers of the Board. That 34,434 orders for the cleansing and repair of inhabited houses in the District have been issued and enforced; 33 but during this time very many of the smaller houses have been repaired and cleansed on several occasions. As many as 12,135 drains have been cleansed, repaired or relaid, and a much larger number of inefficient or broken traps have been replaced by yard gulley or similar traps. The record of the repairs to the paving of yards or as to new paving was not kept separately until 1866, so that the number stated, 5,751, does not represent the true number. The same remark applies to dust bins, of which 5,627 have been provided during these years, and also to the houses to which a proper water supply apparatus for the closets have been procured. The number stated, 5,627, must be supplemented by the 4,719 cesspools removed, making a total of 10,346. There have also been 7,083 houses disinfected by the Officers of the Board, or under their superintendance, and a total of 107,224 nuisances abated in 26¼ years. The number of loads of dust removed during the year was 22,314, or less than one load per house, all of which was checked on delivery at the shoots by men employed by the Board, as well as by the men engaged in collecting the dust and house refuse. The total cost of removing the dust, including the salary of the dust inspector, was £2,993 13s. 3d., the amount paid to the contractors being £2,170 13s. 2d. and as the number of loads removed was 22,314, the cost per load would be 2s. 8d., which, considering the great size of the District, is very moderate when compared with other parishes. The work was also efficiently done, as except during the time when the temporary inspector was employed, the complaints were very few. The total number of requests to remove house refuse amounted to 2,969 during the year. The cost for disinfection during the year was unusually large, as £167 7s. were paid to the men employed, in addition to the salary of the Inspector. The sum expended on disinfectants was £120 9s. 9d., but this included the disinfectants used for gullies and the sewers. Coal, coke and other charges came to £56 12s. 5d., against which there was received £46 7s., showing 34 an outlay of nearly £300. In addition there was the cost of a new disinfector amounting to nearly £123. As, however, 6,582 articles of clothing and bedding were disinfected, and 1,045 houses fumigated with sulphur by the Officers employed by the Board, the nett cost is not large, especially as three men were engaged during the greater part of the year, in consequence of the disinfection being done before the articles were removed to the chamber by a man who was not employed in their removal. During the year an Ambulance Station has been erected and furnished by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in London Fields, which has caused a large amount of additional labour and trouble to myself and the senior Inspector, as I have not only made many visits to the Station, but also went to the Hospital Ships and the Station at Millwall to satisfy myself as to the mode of disinfection. On one occasion I was accompanied by Dr. Bristowe for the purpose of making a special report thereon. I pointed out many, as I considered, objectionable arrangements as regards the station, conveyances dress of the male attendants and the nurses, as well as the mode of disinfection, all of which were speedily altered. I have attended an unusually large number of Committee and other Meetings during the year 1881, viz. 24 meetings of tho View Committee, 28 of the Sanitary Committee, all the Board Meetings, and 6 Special Meetings. I have also attended at the House of Commons to give evidence before the Royal Commission on Hospitals for Infectious Diseases; at a Meeting of Delegates at the Vestry Hall, Kensington, re Notifications of Infectious Diseases; and also at the Metropolitan Board of Works in the matter of the offiensive smells from their sewer in Wick Road. The meetings of the View Committee were held not only for viewing cowsheds and slaughter houses, but for many other purposes. Several complaints were made during the year of black smoke being emitted from the chimneys of manufactories. In two instances they were caused by a slight neglect of the stokers, 35 who were warned, as I found an efficient smoke consuming apparatus fixed to each furnace. In other instances I discovered furnaces without any smoke consuming apparatus whatever, aud ordered notices to be served requiring the owners of the furnaces to affix proper doors to each, which was done, and the nuisances abated. The self-recording gas pressure guage has worked satisfactorily during the year, and has shown that the pressure maintained by the Gas Companies was much in excess of that required by Act of Parliament. This must have entailed an excessive consumption of gas in houses abutting on main thoroughfares, unless great care were used for regulating the supply of gas by a stop cock near the meter, which is frequently neglected. The burners employed should be of a proper make, and either be replaced by new or carefully cleansed from time to time. The meteorology of the year was remarkable, as a most unusual period of cold weather was experienced in January, attended with dense fogs, and total absence of sunshine on several consecutive days. A very heavy snow storm also occurred on the 18th of January, blocking up most of the railway lines out of London, as well as a large number in different parts of the country. On the last day of May a short period of unusual heat set in, and another for a longer period in July. In January the very low temperature of 12.4 degrees Fahr. was recorded on the 17th at my house in the Richmond Poad, 14.2 degrees on the 16th, 14.6 degrees on the 15th, and 15.6 degrees on the 21st. At Blaokheath 9.2 degrees was registered on the 21st; and 11.8 degrees at Camden Square on the 17th, whilst in many parts of the North and in Scotland a temperature several degrees below zero was registered. The mean temperature for the week ending January 8th was nearly a degree above the average, whilst for the week ending the 15th it was minus 10.0 degrees, for the following week it was no less than 15.5 degrees below the average, and for the week ending January 29th the mean temperature was minus 7.4 degrees. 36 The annual death-rate per 1,000 population for these weeks in all London was 20.9 for the week ending January 8th; 226 for the week ending January 15th; 28.4 for the next week, 29.8 for the week ending January 28th, and 27.1 for the week ending February 5th, when the temperature had increased. A rise in the annual death-rate in Hackney occurred to nearly tho same extent, viz. 8.6 per 1,000 population. In February cold weather again prevailed, but to a much less extent, as the mean was only 1.8 below the average of 40 years, whilst in March it was not quite a degree above the average. The lowest temperature recorded in Hackney during February was 28.0 degrees, and in March 27.0. In April and June the temperature was slightly in defect, but in May it was 1.5 degree above the average; the unusually high temperatures of 82.8 having been recorded on tho 31st, and 83.6 degrees and 82.4 degrees on June 1st and 2nd. In July the mean temperature was as much as 3.8 degrees in excess, the following excessively high temperatures having been recorded in Hackney, viz. 87'4 degrees on July 4th, 90 5 degrees on July 5th; 86.6 degrees on July 15th; 88.4 degrees on the 18th, and 87.8 degrees on the 19th of this month. Higher temperatures still were recorded at Greenwich, viz. 90 degrees on the 4th; 92.8 degrees on the 5th; 89.1 degrees on the 14th; 97.1 degrees on the 15th; 90.2 degrees on the 18th, and 88.0 on the 19th of July. At Camden Square the temperatures were rather higher than at Hackney. The mean temperature for the week ending 9th of July was 3.3 degrees in excess; for that ending 16th, 6.9 in excess; for the 23rd, 3.3 in excess; and for the 30th, 2.2 degrees below the average. The annual death-rate per 1,000 population in all London was 21.6 for the week ending July 9th; 24.7 for that ending July 16th; 26.5 for that ending July 23rd; 27.2 for that ending July 30th, and declined to 23.4 for the first week in August, when it had fallen to below the mean for the last week of July and early in August. The increased death-rate was caused chiefly by diarrhoea, as the following number of deaths from this cause show, viz. 135 in the week ending July 9th, and 292, 449, 495 and 37 297 during the four succeeding weeks. In August the mean temperature was minus 2.4 degrees; in September, minus 1.8 degree; in October, minus 4.8 degrees; in November, plus 5.3 degrees, and in December 0.1 degree. In the early part of October the weather was singularly cold, the temperature having been in defect 11 degrees on the 5th, and again on the 16th the low temperature of 33.2 degrees, or only 1.2 degree above freezing point, having been recorded at Hackney on the 6th; 31.6, or nearly half a degree below freezing point on the 16th; the singularly low temperature of 28.4 degrees, or 3.6 degrees below freezing point on the 17th, and 29.4 degrees or 2.6 below freezing point on the 31st. It was the coldest October, with one exception, during the present century, when a mean of 45.0 degrees was recorded in 1817 against 45.3 degrees in the present year. Although, as before stated, two great floods on the Marshes occurred during this year, the rainfall was not anything unusual, the total registered at my house being 26.07 inches, and the two heaviest falls in 24 hours having been only 1.02 inches and 1.19 respectively, which occurred in August and October.
