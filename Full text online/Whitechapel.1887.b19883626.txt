WHI 35 THE ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION, &c., &c., of the WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (WITH VITAL STATISTICS,) FOR THE YEAR 1887, by JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Surgeon to the London Sailors' Home, &c. london: printed by penny and hull, leman street, e. 1888. Office of the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, No. 15, Great Alie Street, London, E., February 21st, 1888. Gentlemen, The Registrar-General informs us that in the year 1886, remarkable low Rates prevailed. The marriage-rate was the lowest on record, being in London 16.6 persons married to 1000 inhabitants. The birth-rate in London was in the proportion of 32.3 births to 1000 inhabitants; a rate (with the exception of 1850 when it was 32.0 per 1000) which was unequalled. The death-rate was 19.9 per 1000. The rate in 1885 was 19.8 per 1000, and these constitute the lowest recorded death-rates since the present system of civil registration began. In the volume from which I quote, the same allowances are made for residents and non-residents which I have introduced into my Annual Reports, and the accuracy of the Official figures, so far as our District is concerned, is worth noting. Thus, the total number of the Residents' deaths, wherever occurring, is given as 1629, which is only 5 more than the correct number, and other statistical calculations are equally accurate. In fact, were the summary published six months earlier, many of my own details would be altogether anticipated by it. REPORT FOR -1887. ALTHOUGH no direct evidence can be adduced to support my proposition, I am of opinion that the great influx of foreigners into our District has ceased. The increase of population therefore, must be explained on other grounds, and I think it is due, firstly, to the natural increase of births over deaths, and secondly, to the peopling of new Dwellings which have been opened since my last report. I estimate the population of the Whitechapel District to have been, during the year 1887, 73,485, and disposed as follows:— In the Spitalfields Sub-District 20,057 ,, Mile End New Town ditto 23,344 ,, Whitechapel Church ditto 17,114. ,, Goodman's Fields ditto 7,370 ,, Aldgate ditto 5,600 Total 73,485 The total Births which were registered in the Whitechapel District during the 52 weeks of the year 1887, were 2572, an increase of 41 as compared with the preceding year. The Deaths during the same period were 2246, being 17 fewer than in 1886. Tables A and B* of the appendix illustrate these statements, and indicate that 1248 boys were born to 1324 girls; whilst 1199 males and 1047 females died. But in these latter are included many persons who, belonging to other Districts, took advantage of our Public Institutions, and thus became registered in one of our Sub-Districts. On the other hand, many of our own Residents died in Public Institutions in other Districts. I have therefore, again arranged in tabulated form those deaths which influence the District mortality statistics. *Page 19. 6 In Table C* there appears particulars of the 755 persons whose deaths were registered in, but who did not really belong to the District. Thus 2 men died in the Aldgate Sub-District; 4 males and 1 female in the Mile End New Town Sub-District; and 439 males, and 309 females in the Whitechapel Church Sub-District, all in the London Hospital. Table D† details the Public Institutions to which the 111 Whitechapel residents resorted either as permanent homes or temporary refuges. These factors enable me readily to construct Table E‡ in which is demonstrated the exact state of the District loss by death, for each quarter of the year under consideration. Instead of an increase of 168 deaths, (vide Report for 1886,) I have now to report a decrease of 22 deaths, as compared with last year, but each Sub-District does not occupy in this respect an equally happy position, for whilst the deaths are fewer this year in Mile End New Town, the Whitechapel Church, and the Goodman's Fields Sub-Districts; in the Spitalfields, and in the Aldgate SubDistricts, they have become increased. I am forced to confess that I can offer no explanation for these relative differences, as they do not in any way correspond to the estimated variation of population in the Sub-Districts. The natural increase of births over deaths is 970. In 1886, it was 901; in 1885, it was 917; and in 1884, it was 929. Assuming my premises to be accurate, then the Whitechapel death-rate for the year 1887 was 21.8 per 1000, which is the lowest rate ever recorded in the District. Tables F§ and G§ set out the correct District deaths according to age distribution, thus:— 27.5 % of the total deaths occurred under the age of 1 year 17.4 ,, ,, ,, between the ages of 1 and 5 4.3 „ ,, „ 5 and 20 13.4 ,, „ „ „ 20 and 40 19.7 „ „ „ „ „ 40 and 60 15.1 „ „ „ „ „ 60 and 80 2.3 „ ,, ,, over the age of 80 *Page 19. †Page 19. ‡Page 20. §Page 20. 7 Thirty-seven persons lived to over the age of 80 years, and 3 of these survived to above 90, one of whom died in the Spitalfields Sub-District, aged 96. It is interesting to record that of these old people, 23 were women and 14 were men. Twenty-seven of the deaths were registered as Old Age, 2 were attributed to Accidents, and the remainder to Chest or Nervous diseases. Uncertified Deaths. During the year, 9 deaths (males 4, females 5,) were registered as "uncertified," of which all but one were of infants. The latter were certified by Midwives in all cases as "Premature birth" or "Convulsions." Their ages varied from a few hours to 5 days. The Adult case was a woman, aged 45, whose death was probably caused by disease of the heart. District Public Institutions. It will appear from a statement elsewhere, that 886 persons died during the year in the London Hospital. Only 138 of these were residents in the District. Over 55 per cent. of our residents who died away from their homes, selected the London Hospital for treatment. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary, 68 births, and 285 deaths were recorded, 5 of the latter belonged to other Districts. Thus 280 Residents died in the Infirmary this year, against 316 in 1886, and 292 in 1885. During the same period the District Medical Officers received a total of 3983 new Orders for attendance upon patients either at the Dispensary in Thomas Street, or at the patients' homes. Of these, 2340 were immediately received either into the Infirmary in Baker's Row, or into special hospitals. The diseases for which these persons required treatment, will be found particularized upon Table H* of the Appendix. From statements kindly furnished to me, by Mr. W. Vallance, Clerk to the Whitechapel Board of Guardians, it appears that the Infirmary, during the year, has contained numbers varying each week, from 648 to 461, or a weekly average of 546.2; whilst the weekly admissions have ranged between 97 and 44, equal to an average of 62.5 per week. The total number of Districft Medical Orders issued, were 482 in excess of the preceding year, whilst the admissions were 302 in excess. The Infirmary deaths were 38 fewer than in 1886. *Page 21. 8 ANALYSIS OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH OF THE 1602 RESIDENTS. Table I* is arranged to indicate the number of deaths in each class of disease, and for comparison purposes, I have also added the numbers applicable to the entire Metropolis, including the District. You will perceive, that whilst in the whole of London, 17.32 per cent. of the total deaths were attributed to Zymotic diseases, the Whitechapel District can only be credited with losing 14.19 per cent. of its total deaths from this class of disease. This difference is not very dissimilar to last year's record. The remarks I have made in previous reports as to variations in the other classes, I notice to be also applicable this year to them. Table K† epitomizes the information contained in the weekly returns, which I receive from the Metropolitan Asylums' Board Office. Its consideration demonstrates that whilst last year we contributed nearly 3 per cent. of the total number of cases admitted into that Board's Hospitals, this year only 2 per cent. of the total number belonged to the Whitechapel District. The return shows that Small-Pox is still almost absent from our District, seeing that out of a total of 128 cases in the Metropolis which were received, only 5 were charged to us. This is not strictly accurate however, because in the South District there occurred, during October, 6 cases of this disease within an area limited by several houses backing upon each other. Fortunately, they occurred in the immediate vicinity of my Surgery, and I was able to at once trace the outbreak to a seaman who had visited a brother, whom he infected before he was admitted into the Hospital. By the immediate removal of fresh cases, and by vaccination and revaccination of relatives of the patients, the disease became stamped out. I know of no evidence, which to an unbiassed mind, could bring more convincing proof of the all-powerful ability of this simple operation to prevent the spread of this dire disease, than a study of this group of cases. I am pleased, whilst on this subject, to again bear testimony to the good work performed by Mr. Sherman, the Vaccination Officer to the Union, whose report I append in Table L‡. Scarlet Fever has tried to the utmost the resources of the Asylums' Board Managers during the year, and well have they *Page 22. †Page 23. ‡Page 24. 9 grappled with their difficult task. The total cases dealt with by them numbered 5932, against 1661 during the preceding year. Our removals were for this year 118, as contrasted with 50 for the year 1886. Upon the subject of Scarlet Fever, on October 27th, the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board requested to be furnished with certain information regarding the outbreak in our District, to which I replied, "The chief difficulty at the outset of the investigation is the present impossibility of knowing all the cases which occur within the District, and of course, without this important factor, the exact value of a knowledge of the number of cases which have been removed to hospitals is lessened. That many cases of Scarlet Fever remain concealed from Sanitary Authorities, either through ignorance or design, I am aware, having frequently met with cases of Scarlatinal Sequelae, which only by accident have been brought to notice. Hence the vast importance of obtaining, by Act of Parliament, compulsory notification of all infectious diseases. The statistics at my disposal show that during the year 1884 we were apprised of 119 cases of Scarlet Fever, which occurred throughout the Whitechapel District, of which number 66.3 per cent. were removed to hospitals. In 1885, 62.5 per cent. of 40 cases were removed; and in 1886 we knew of 79 cases, of which 63.2 per cent. were removed. Up to the end of the 42nd week of the current year we were aware of 115 cases, of which 82.6 per cent. were taken charge of by the Metropolitan Asylums' Board. Although these particulars can afford no clue to the total number of cases which have occurred in the District, it is plain that those cases known to us this year are greatly in excess of those with which we dealt in former years. It is also patent that the increasing popularity of the Asylums' Board Hospitals have induced many more persons to seek treatment in them than was formerly the case. I further notice that our deaths from Scarlet Fever have generally been uniform in numbers during the past few years, and that the deaths in hospitals, which in 1885 equalled 25.0 per cent. of the total deaths from that disease, in 1886 equalled 54.5 per cent., or nearly double. Up to the end of the 42nd week of this year 38.8 per cent. of our total District deaths from Scarlet Fever were registered in hospitals. 10 The evidence I have adduced would also lead to the inference that the present epidemic is of a milder type than has been the case in some former epidemics. My observation has convinced me that every facility should be forthcoming to effect the early removal to hospital of all Scarlet Fever patients, and that no invidious distinction should be made at any time between so-called non-pauper and pauper patients, because it is to the interest of the community as a whole that every means should be used to remove very early all persons suffering from this disease. It is only right to add that so far as I am concerned no difficulty has been encountered in this direction during the present epidemic." Some very useful and interesting statistics as to Scarlet Fever have been adduced from an examination of nearly 18,000 cases of the disease treated in the London Fever Hospital and in the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals during the twelve years 1874-85. From the known mortality from Scarlet Fever at different ages, and the known case-mortality in hospital cases at the same groups of ages, the number of cases of attack have been calculated; and, finally, the proportion of the population that is protected at each successive age period in each sex, is given, with the relative proportions between the cases and the unprotected population. The main results deduced from these calculations, after due allowance for the hypothetical character of some of the assumptions, are (I) the mortality from the disease is at its maximum in the third year of life, and afterwards diminishes with age—at first slowly, and afterwards rapidly; (2) the liability to attack of the unprotected is small in the first year of life, reaches its maximum about the fifth year, and then rapidly decreases with age; (3) the chance of fatal termination of an attack is highest in infancy, then declines with age, to the twenty-fifth year of age, and afterwards slightly increases again; (4) females are more liable throughout life to an attack than males, but the attacks in males are more liable to fatal termination than the attacks in females. The Registrar-General, in concluding his remarks on these important details, says: "Independently of the plain fact that a very large proportion of persons go through life without contracting this disease, it is shown that the longer an attack is deferred the 11 less likely is it to occur at all; and not only so, but that even supposing it to occur eventually the less likely it is to end fatally." The value of the foregoing conclusions is thus stated by the leading Medical journal: "Such conclusions should not only strengthen the hands of medical officers of health in their endeavours to combat infectious disease by isolation, but should secure the more intelligent co-operation of the public in the same direction. If there is still a lingering doubt in some quarters as to the separation from its family of a child attacked by Scarlet Fever being worth the trouble and expense it involves, on the ground that the other children are almost certain to contract this disease at some future time, and that therefore they may as well have it at once, the above-mentioned conclusions of the Registrar-General cannot be too widely disseminated." Before leaving this branch of my Report, I have to mention that within a short period of time there were five cases of Typhus Fever removed to hospital. Three occurred in Ely Place, and two in Osborn Court. I could not discover any cause to which I could specially attribute this sporadic outbreak, but I rejoice to say that no notification has been received of fresh cases. It is worthy of mention that so rare has this disease become that the medical gentlemen who reported these cases failed to appreciate the symptoms correctly, and they were received into the hospital as cases of "Enteric Fever." Failing from an examination of the circumstances surrounding the above cases to identify a cause, I am driven to take advantage of the views recently advanced by Dr. Aitken, in a remarkable book, on the Origin of some Diseases by or through the physiological processes going on during life. In this work it is well argued that certain alkaloid poisons known to be produced in the body after death—and called ptomaines and leucomaines, are capable of being formed in the animal organism during life, as a result of normally elaborated, but toxic products. Thus Sir William Aitken accounts for the production of certain diseases, such as Fatigue Fever and Typhus Fever of armies and of camps, and also of Typhoid Fever when of spontaneous origin. 12 Memorandum concerning the use of Disinfectants. The subject of Disinfection is a wide one, which requires very careful consideration, more particularly as advances in science have proved the fallacy of very many preconceived theories concerning the causation and propagation of diseases. Disinfection demands the destruction not only of disease germs, but also of the spores of those germs. It is therefore imperative to differentiate between Deodorants, which merely mask mal-odours, and Disinfectants, which are absolute germicides. Whilst the former may be useful to sensitive people, the latter are truly valuable in cutting short the vitality of those subtle active principles which often spread broadcast the seeds of disease, and too frequently carry death with them. The arrows of the sanitarian must therefore be aimed at all zymotic germs, and this can best be done by the selection of suitable disinfectants. I do not allude here, of course, to natural disinfectants, as air, water, &c., but will at once state the particular manufactured articles which I consider most appropriate to the special work required to be performed by them. Thus, for the disinfection of enclosed spaces, sulphurous acid and chlorine gases should be generated in them by means of suitable apparatus. For the disinfection of clothing, and such like articles which can be removed, super-heated steam is required. For bricks, plaster, wood, and paint, I know nothing to equal a 1 in 2000 solution of mercuric chloride, which has also cheapness to recommend it. Chloride of lime is also valuable for this purpose. Sanitas and carbolic acid, purchased in their crude states, are the best preparations when dissolved for use in the streets and courts, and also for flushing gullies. Urinals are, perhaps, best treated by solutions of sulphate of iron. For dust-bins, and other collections of offensive rubbish, carbolic powder offers the most ready means of application, but I hope we may soon be able to eliminate these from our category. (Vide note on "Pail System.") Table M,* which contains a complete list of the District deaths for the year 1887, may be compared with the following table,† whereupon is shown the Metropolitan deaths for the same year. They both indicate again a large mortality from diarrhoea. In our own District, out of a total of 80 deaths from the disease, *Page 25. †Page 26. 13 64 were registered during the 3rd quarter of the year, and they were chiefly of infants and very young children. The whole of the cases of Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Typhus Fever, Enteric Fever, Diphtheria, and Measles with which our department has become acquainted during the year are recorded upon Table O.* Disinfection has been carried out in every case under the personal direction of your Inspectors, and the means, with which you are familiar, have been adopted to counteract any tendency towards the dissemination of disease. 147 cases of Scarlet Fever are recorded against 79, 40, and 119 respectively in the three preceding years, whilst the deaths for corresponding years were respectively 27, 22, 16, and 45. These returns indicate an improvement probably due to one or more of the following conditions— more prompt isolation, improved sanitary precautions, and a less virulent type of the disease. Table P† contains so much of the Inspectors' work as can be thus set out. It gives me great pleasure to again mention the names of Messrs. Battram and Wrack in terms of the highest praise. Infant Mortality. The deaths of infants under the age of one year in London equalled 25.5 per cent. of the total deaths and 15.7 per cent. of the registered births, whilst in the Whitechapel District, those infants who died under the age of one year, equalled 27.5 per cent. of the total deaths, and 17.1 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under five years of age, including the above, were, for London, equal to 42.7 per cent. of the total deaths, and 26.4 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 45.0 per cent. of the total deaths, and 28.0 per cent. of the registered births. Extra Metropolitan Deaths. During the year 34 deaths of residents (18 men and 16 women) were returned from Leavesden, Banstead, and Colney Hatch Asylums; 19 of the deaths were attributed to brain diseases, 9 to diseases of the chest, and the remainder to old age. *Page 27. †Page 28. 14 Violent Deaths. Fifty-eight deaths were by Coroners' Juries attributed to violence, they took place in the Registration Sub. Districts, as follows:— Sub-District. Males. Females. Total.

A total of 319 Inquests were held in the District during the year, of which number only 179 had reference to District residents. I regret to report that we are not possessed of a Mortuary—the only difficulty being the absence of a suitable site upon which to erect it. We are still indebted therefore to the Whitechapel Board of Guardians for their co-operation when occasion requires such aid. Model Dwellings The total deaths appertaining to this class of buildings in the District amount to 158, which is equal to an annual death rate per 1000 of nearly 18. *Included in these were the 17 deaths which took place at a dramatic performance at 3, Princes Street, Spitalfields, from fire and panic. 15 Since my last Report there have been occupied in Cartwright Street some dwellings, built for Messrs. Rothschild by Mr. J. Sparks. They are, without doubt, the best in the District. They are constructed after plans by Messrs. Wilson, Son and Aldwinch, and consist of 64 rooms arranged to accommodate families requiring either two, three, or four rooms each. The sanitary arrangements, and also the requisites for comfort, are excellently devised. The buildings comprise four stories, and all staircases and corridors are constructed of fire-proof materials. The staircase walls are lined with a dado of white glazed bricks, and all landings and passages are paved with red and buff Staffordshire tiles. The W.C.'s and slop shoots are placed in projecting wings at the rear with an intervening lobby between them and the main building. The soil pipes are all external, with fresh air inlets at the bottom and exhaust ventilation at the top, and the drainage is laid in straight lines between large ventilated man-holes. All wash-pipes also have air separation traps at foot, and are open at the top. Special and complete arrangements are made for the removal of the dust by means of external shafts with galvanized iron receivers. In this immediate neighbourhood, approaching completion, are also some model dwellings on a much larger scale, which, if not so ornate as those I have just described, merit mention as evidence of care, from a sanitary point of view, in their design. They will consist of 367 rooms, divided into 220 tenements of three, two, and single rooms. Fireproof materials have been introduced into floors, roofs and stairs, and the walls of the landings and passages are covered with a glazed cement capable of being washed. A sink, with water supply laid on, is provided in each living room, covered in and trapped, with a lead waste discharging into the open rain-water head of the stack pipe outside the wall, which discharges into an open grating above a trap. Like the buildings of Messrs. Rothschild, wash-houses and necessary fittings are provided upon the roofs. The W.C.'s are sufficient and efficient. The drainage is connected to the sewer in approved manner, and a ventilating shaft is carried up above the parapet of each of the buildings. Each block is provided with Inspection and Receiving Chambers, having an air inlet and an iron air-tight cover, built with glazed brick bottom and sides, into which all drain pipes are 16 brought from their respective points, avoiding all junctions, and thus enabling any obstruction to be removed from the Inspection Chamber. All sink and rain-water pipes are properly trapped and ventilated. Each outlet of the Inspection Chamber is provided with a syphon trap having a cleansing eye, fitted with a Stanford joint cover. Dust removal and water supply are well catered for, and it is proposed by Messrs. Pink, Fryer and Co., the builders, to lay out the centre of the quadrangle, formed by the dwellings, as a shrubbery, whilst some portion will be covered with tarpaving to serve as a playground for the children. Such buildings as those I have described must exert a healthful influence upon the people who will inhabit them. Bell Lane Scheme. Some important correspondence has taken place during the year between your Board and the Metropolitan Board of Works upon this question, but I am not aware that any definite action has been decided upon. This year is a memorable one in the history of the Board by reason of the introduction of the 'pail' system for the removal of the Dust of the District. When the arrangements are fully complete a daily collection of house refuse will take place, thus allowing no garbage to remain reeking in dust-bins, to the risk and annoyance of the inhabitants. Registered Common Lodging Houses. These dwellings are under the control of the Police. During the year 144 deaths took place of persons previously resident in these houses, equal to 8.9 per cent. of the total District residents' deaths, and 50.5 per cent. of the total Infirmary deaths. Last year I called your attention to the influence of 'The Mansion House Fund' in attracting to many of the common lodging-houses persons from all parts of the country. Many of these persons eventually were admitted into our public institutions, and they swelled the mortality returns for the year. Thus, the Lodging-house deaths for 1886 were equal to 14 per cent. more of the total Infirmary deaths than was the case in the year we are now discussing. I append the particu of these houses, which are registered to accommodate 6,136 persons:— 17 The following Streets contain Registered Common Lodging Houses. Name of Street. No. of Houses Registered.
