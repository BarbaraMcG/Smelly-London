To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1959, which is prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/60. The Vital Statistics call for little comment as they remain substantially the same as last year and are in line with those of the country as a whole. As has been the case for a number of years, the birth-rate is high. Once again I can report a year free from any case of diphtheria, and it is now twelve years since one occurred. Elsewhere in this report figures are given for the numbers in the district who have received protective immunisation for diphtheria, poliomyelitis, whooping cough and smallpox. There still remain quite a number of parents who have not taken advantage of these measures for their children, and it would be possible for quite a large outbreak to occur among these unprotected children. With the vacant post of Public Health Inspector becoming filled, it has been possible to make further progress with the inspection and subsequent representation of unfit houses, and four further clearance areas were declared. A start has been made on implementing the Clean Air Act, the Council having in principle decided to cover the area in stages in the next ten years. Again I must acknowledge the valuable work done by the various voluntary bodies for the benefit of the elderly people of the district. This year has been a busy one in the department and I must acknowledge my gratitude to Mr. Thomas and other members of the staff for their willing co-operation and help. 4 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (Acres) 770 Population (Census 1931) 27,771 Population (Census 1951) 25,012 Home Population, Mid-year 1959 (estimated by Registrar-General) 25,670 Rateable Value, 1st April, 1959 £354,259 Sum represented by 1d. rate £1,476 The district, situated on the north-west border of Kent, and immediately adjoining the Counties of London and Surrey, is on the slope of a hill, the highest point being 370 feet above sea level and the lowest 95 feet above sea level. The density of population per acre is 33, this being by far the highest in the County of Kent. This results in there being very few open spaces in the district, the largest one being the grounds of the old Crystal Palace the majority of which are in this area. This density of building has caused a shortage of space for school playing fields for the schools of the district and pupils mainly have to go outside the area for games. The Manager of the Employment Exchange for the area informs me that there were 71 men and 22 women in the Penge area registered as unemployed at the end of the year. VITAL STATISTICS Live births 569 Live birth rate per 1,000 population 22.1 Stillbirths 11 Stillbirth rate per 1,000 live and still births 18.9 Total live and still births 580 Infant deaths 11 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births 19.3 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 20.5 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births 0.0 Neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 19.3 Early neo-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births 15.8 Peri-natal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 34.5 Illegitimate live births per cent of the total live births 5.6 Maternal deaths (including abortion) 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 1.7 Births The live births registered during the year numbered 569 compared with 528 in 1958. This gives a crude live birth rate of 22.2 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 20.6 for 1958. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local births is 0.91. This makes the Adjusted Birth Rate 20.2 compared with 18.5 for 1958. 5 Stillbirths The number of stillbirths registered was 11, equal to a rate of 18.9 of 1,000 total births, compared with 25.8 for 1958. Deaths The deaths registered totalled 285, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 11.1 per 1,000 Home Population compared with 12.0 for 1958. The area comparability factor calculated by the Registrar-General for the purpose of securing comparability between local death rates is 0.97. This makes the Adjusted Death Rate 10.78 compared with 11.7 for the year 1958. The death rate for England and Wales was 11.6 compared with 11.7 recorded for 1958. Deaths among the inmates of an Institution for elderly men numbered 9. A large proportion of deaths was of elderly people, and of the total deaths 197 or 69.1% were of persons 65 years of age and over compared with 68.8% the previous year. Those dying at 75 years of age and over accounted for 47.3% of the total deaths compared with 45.4% in 1958. Cancer Deaths from cancer numbered 50 giving a death rate for Home Population of 1.9 compared with 2.34 for 1958. The rate for England and Wales was 1.6. Tuberculosis There were two deaths from tuberculosis in Penge giving a death rate of .077. The rate for England and Wales was .085. Maternal Mortality There was one maternal death during the year giving a death rate of 1.7. The rate for England and Wales was 0.38 compared with 0.43 for 1958. Infantile Mortality The number of deaths under one year was 11, corresponding to a rate of 19.3 for 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 15.15 for 1958. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 15.8. All of these infants died under the age of 3 weeks, and 9 of them under one week; three deaths were from congenital malformations. Comparative Vital Statistics The following table shows the comparative figures for 1959:— Rate per 1,000 Home Population Rate per 1,000 total births Death Rate per 1,000 totcl Population Deaths under 1 year per 1,000 live births Live Births Still births Penge Urban District 22.1 18.9 11.1 19.3 England and Wales 16.5 20.7 11.6 22.0 6 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The water supply of the area has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity, all the houses in the area being provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Drainage and Sewerage All the premises in the district are connected to the public sewers, the sewage of Penge going through the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham, into the London County Council's sewers, and part of the surface water into a local stream which is culverted. Rivers and Streams There are no rivers in the district. There is a stream forming part of the boundary between Penge and Beckenham the whole of which is culverted. Closet Accommodation The whole of the premises in the area are provided with waterclosets connected to the main drainage system. Public Cleansing House refuse is collected throughout the district once every week by the Council's refuse collection service using modern vehicles, and the refuse is taken for disposal to the Beckenham destructor. Trade refuse is also dealt with. There are no cesspools in the district. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The subject is dealt with under the heading of Housing and in the report of the Chief Public Health Inspector.

To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, I desire to present the Annual Report for the year ended 31st December, 1959, setting out the work of the Public Health Inspectors. During the year Mr. H. J. Rogers joined the staff of the department. Possibly the most notable feature of the work carried out during the year was increased housing inspection, so necessary in a district where much of the house property is over 60 years old and let in tenements. As a result of the housing inspection work four clearance areas were represented to the Council by the Medical Officer of Health. Much work under slum clearance provision of the Housing Act, 1957, remains to be carried out, and it will probably be ten years before the district can be considered free of unfit property. The work must of necessity be slow by reason of the absence of building sites within the district wherein the clearance area population may be rehoused. I feel obliged to draw the attention of the Council to the need of further powers to deal with houses let in multiple occupation—known as Houses-let-inLodgings. With the repeal of the Housing Act, 1936, local authorities lost their powers to make byelaws to control these properties, including the powers of registration and placing on the persons in control of such dwellings the duties of cleansing and lighting of common staircases and the cleansing of sanitary conveniences in common use, and sanitary fitments, powers which are, in my opinion, most desirable. Not only houses-let-in-lodgings cause anxiety. Blocks of modern flats have, from time to time, been the concern of the department. Whilst most owners of modern blocks of flats face up to the problems of service maintenance, unfortunately this is not always the case, and instances of neglect in the maintenance of lighting of common staircases, passenger lifts, gardens, together with the absence of regular cleansing of common passage, staircases, drain gullies, come to the notice of the department. With the increasing development of multiple flat blocks one wonders whether the time has not arrived for local authorities to possess legal authority in the form of byelaws to deal with these problems. During the.year 662 complaints (excluding those in connection with rodent infestation) were received, the great majority being concerned with housing defects and nuisances. All complaints'were investigated and appropriate action taken where necessary. In addition to verbal intimation of defects in premises, 285 written informal notices and 45 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. 280 Intimation Notices and 43 Statutory Notices were complied with. The local authority, in default of the owners, carried out works required by five statutory notices under Section 39, Public Health Act, 1936. The Council also did the work required by four notices served under Section 24, Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers (previously known as combined drains). 15 The amount of work done following action taken by your Inspectors will be seen on reference to the summary of work executed. Every endeavour is made informally to have notices complied with before statutory action is taken. It was, however, necessary to take legal proceedings in two cases with the following results:— Case No. 1—Non-compliance with Court Order. Fined 5s. per day, a total of £19. Case No. 2—Non-compliance with Statutory Notice. Order made to execute repairs in 28 days and to pay £1 11s. 6d. costs. In a few cases the tenants of dwellings freed from control under the Rent Act, 1957, whilst complaining about the condition of their dwellings, have pleaded that no communication be sent to their landlord, on the grounds that any such communication would lead to notice to quit being served. In an area where there is still a great shortage of dwellings these tenants have little prospect of being placed on the Council's housing list, because having recently moved into the district they would not have the necessary qualifications. The drainage systems of 8 premises were relaid or partially relaid, and 134 cleared of obstruction or repaired. Disinfestation of 84 rooms found to be verminous was carried out. Four licences to deal in game were issued during the year.

The samples gave the following averages:— Fat—3.51% (standard 3.0%) Solids not fat—8.8% (standard 8.5%) Thirty-four samples of pasteurised milk and eleven samples of tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk were submitted to the Phosphatase and Methylene Blue tests and with the exception of one sample all satisfied the tests. Eight samples of sterilised milk were examined and satisfied the turbidity test. Ice-Cream There are no manufacturers in the district, but premises are registered for the sale of ice-cream, the shop-keepers obtaining their supplies from wellknown manufacturers. In the great majority of cases the ice-cream is delivered to the premises and sold in cartons or wrapped. Thirty samples of ice-cream were taken and submitted to the Methylene Blue test with the following results:— Grade 1—22 Grade 2—8 In no case was ice-cream found to be stored at a temperature exceeding 28° Fahrenheit. Slaughterhouses There are no slaughterhouses in the district. Adulteration The Kent County Sampling Officers took 122 samples of various foods and drugs in the district. Included in the total were 39 samples of milk, 18 of drugs and 10 of spirits. All the samples were genuine with the exception of the following:— sample of analysis action taken Macedoine of Vegetables Ingredients given in wrong order of proportion. Maker notified. 20 Your Inspectors obtained 54 informal samples of milk, the Analyst reporting all samples to be genuine. RENT ACT, 1957 The following is a summary of applications received under the provisions of the Act and subsequent action arising therefrom:— Certificates of Disrepair applications under the 1957 Act 11 Notices of proposal to issue certificates served 10 Number of Certificates of Disrepair issued 4 Number of copies of undertakings to carry out repairs received 10 Number of Certificates cancelled 14 It will be noted that the use of the repair machinery of the Act is little used. Experience obtained as a result of house-to-house inspection shows that tenants could make much greater use of the Act to secure repair of houses. Possibly the reasons for the present position are in some cases the landlord has elected not to take advantage of the increased rent provisions of the Act, and some tenants feel that to do so might prejudice their security of tenure at some future date. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 and 1938 Visits paid to factories totalled 274, and in addition to verbal intimations regarding small defects, two written notices were served and complied with. These dealt mainly with insufficient and defective sanitary conveniences and want of cleanliness. Notices were received in respect of 19 Penge residents who were employed in certain trades in their own homes but working for occupiers of factories in other districts. In no case was it found that work was being done in unwholesome premises. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 During the year the Council decided in principle to agree to the whole of the Urban District being made a Smoke Control Area within the next ten years, and as a first step gave instructions for a detailed survey of the first area to be dealt with to be carried out. In October a successful "Cleaner Air Exhibition " was held at the Town Hall. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Complaints numbering 266 regarding rats and mice were received from all parts of the district and investigated. In several cases it was found that defective drains and sewers were associated with rat infestations and the keeping of animals contributed to the number of rat infestations. When considered necessary the drainage systems of the premises were tested with smoke and colour and any defects found made good. 21 As in previous years the foul water sewers were treated on two occasions. In April 169 manholes and side entrances were baited and takes recorded in 57. The figures for the October treatment were 147 manholes baited and takes recorded in 11. One full-time rodent operative is employed and the following is a summary of work carried out by him at premises in the district:— Inspections and re-inspections made 2,659 Premises treated for rats 446 Premises where rat poison baits taken 146 Premises subject to post-baiting treatment for rats 296 Premises treated for mice 130 Premises re-treated for mice 27 Number of "block controls" carried out 157 RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951 The object of the Act is to secure the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Three premises are registered in connection therewith. Samples of materials used at each of the registered premises were obtained and the prescribed Analyst under the Act reported the tests showed the samples to be satisfactory and complied with the requirements of the regulations. MOVABLE DWELLINGS The camping and caravan site of nearly three acres in the Crystal Palace Grounds, established in 1951, continues to be occupied. Suites of waterclosets and lavatory basins and hot and cold shower baths are provided in a brick building on the site, and there are suitable arrangements for the collection and disposal of refuse. Periodic inspections were made of the camp. The question of fire risk at the site was referred to the Kent County Council Fire Service, who made several useful suggestions which were acted upon. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act came into force on 1st April, 1952, and regulates the sale of pet animals. Licences were granted to four applicants subject to conditions laid down by the Council, these conditions being based on those recommended bv the R.S.P.C.A. Legal proceedings were taken against the proprietor of Kennels in the district for keeping a pet shop without being licensed. There was a conflict of evidence and the case was dismissed. From the experience gained as a result of this case, it would appear to be almost impossible to secure a successful prosecution in a case where a dog of mixed breed is concerned, having regard to the provision in the Act relative to pedigree animals, and the definition of pedigree animals, which as far as dogs are concerned includes crossbreeds. 22 SHOPS ACT, 1950 YOUNG PERSONS (EMPLOYMENT) ACT, 1938 Number of visits 311 Number of Sunday patrols carried out 26 Number of evening patrols carried out 42 Number of premises where young persons employed 16 Number of "Mixed" shops where posters relating to Early Closing Day and Sunday trading not exhibited 4 Letters of warning were sent with reference to contravention of the Act relative to the non-exhibition of forms in "mixed" shops when open for Sunday trading, and on the afternoon of the early closing day. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952 and HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953 These regulations made it an offence to sell or expose for sale certain heating appliances unless fitted with an effective fireguard as prescribed in the regulations. As a result of this enactment and statutory instrument the tests prescribed on heating appliances exposed for sale in the district were made. Number of premises where tests carried out 7 All the appliances tested satisfied the requirements of the regulations. I wish to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their courtesy and assistance during the year. I am, Mr. Chairman, Lady and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, E. G. THOMAS, Chief Public Health Inspector.
