To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present to you my 19th Annual Report on the vital statistics and the conditions affecting the health of the Borough for the year 1911. POPULATION. The population of Fulham as enumerated at the Census taken on April 2nd, 1911, was 153,284, showing an increase in the ten years of 15,995 or 11.7 per cent, which was exceeded in only two of the Metropolitan boroughs, viz., Wandsworth with 34.2 per cent. and Lewisham with 26.2 per cent. increase, while in the administrative County of London the population was less by 13,300 than in 1901. The natural increase of the population of Fulham during the same period by the excess of births over deaths was 24,118, a loss by an excess of removals over incomers being recorded for the first time during an intercensal period. The Census returns show that the population, as calculated in the previous report upon the number of rated houses, was overestimated to the extent of about 3.4 per cent., while the Registrar-General's estimate of the population in the middle of 1911, viz. 186,190, which was based upon the assumption that the rate of increase prevailing in the intercensal period of 1896-1901 had been maintained, was 21 per cent. too high. The following table shows the increase of the borough in the last sixty years:— TABLE I. Year. Population. Increase per cent. during previous intercensal period. Persons to the Acre.

The females enumerated in Fulham exceed the males by 7,960, there being 110.9 females to every 100 males, which compares with 112.4 to every 100 at the Census of 1901 and 113.9 to every 100 at that of 1891. The variations in the proportion of the sexes in the several wards of the borough will be seen in the following table:— TABLE III. Proportion of Males to Females. Ward.

For years before 1911 some of the corrected rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. *In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. †Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The Medical Officer of Health will state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of "non-residents" which are to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of " residents" registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found. Total population at all ages 153,284 Number of inhabited tenements 36.430 At Census of 1911. Area of District in acres (exclusive of area covered by water), 1701. Average number of persons per tenement 4.2 9 MARRIAGES AND MARRIAGE-RATE. The number of marriages registered during the year was 1,353, compared with 1,205, 1,182 and 1,273 in the three preceding years. The marriage-rate i.e., the number of persons married per 1,000 inhabitants was 17.7, the average rate for the previous ten years being 16.0. BIRTHS AND BIRTH-RATE. Excluding 5 births among non-residents and including 115 children born of Fulham mothers in lying-in institutions situate in other boroughs, the total number of births registered in 1911 was 4,122, of whom 2,076 were boys and 2,046 girls, representing a birth-rate of 26.9 per 1,000, which is the lowest yet recorded in Fulham and 3.9 per 1,000 below the mean of the preceding ten years. The birth-rate of the County of London was 24.8 per 1000 and among the several Metropolitan boroughs the rates, after correction by the distribution of the births in lying-in institutions to the boroughs in which the mothers ordinarily resided, ranged from 11.6 in the City of London and 14.9 in Hampstead to 31.5 in Bethnal Green and 31.9 in Shoreditch. The following table gives the number of births and the birth-rate in the various wards, corrected by the distribution of the births in Fulham Infirmary and the inclusion of those occurring in outside Maternity Institutions:— 10 TABLE V.

The illegitimates numbered 200, or 4.9 per cent. of the total births—170 occurred among those born within and 30 among those born outside the Borough. Still-born Children. 120 still-born children were buried in Fulham Cemetery, being in the proportion of one still-born child to every 33 living. Excess of Births over Deaths. The natural increase of the population by the excess of births over deaths was 1,894, compared with 2,553, 2,192 and 2,402 in the three preceding years. 11 TABLE VI.

For the precise meaning of the term "transferable deaths" see footnote to Table IV. (b) All deaths occurring in institutions for the sick and infirm situated within the district, whether of residents or of nonresidents, are entered in column 11 of Table VI.

Birth Rate per 1,000 of the population. Death Rate from all causes per 1,000 of the population. Death Rate from Epidemic Diseases per 1,000 of the population. 13 DEATHS AND DEATH-RATE. The deaths registered in the borough during 1911 numbered 2,019, 1,012 males and 1,007 females, but of these 169, 87 males and 82 females, were of persons not belonging to the borough who died within it, while the deaths of 378 residents in Fulham, 229 males and 149 females, occurred outside the borough, chiefly in various public institutions. There were therefore 2,228 deaths of persons belonging to Fulham, 1,154 males and 1,074 females, representing an annual rate of 14.5 per 1,000 of the enumerated population—the rate for males being 15.9 and for females 13.3. This is the highest deathrate recorded since 1906 and is 0.6 per 1,000 above the average rate of the past five years. The rates in the several metropolitan boroughs ranged from 9.6 in Hampstead, 11.3 in Lewisham, and 12.0 in Wandsworth to 18.9 in Poplar, 19.8 in Finsbury, and 20.1 in Shoreditch, and in the following table the mortality of Fulham may be compared with those of the metropolis, the adjoining boroughs and the provincial towns:— Death-rate in 1911.

Infantile Mortality, Of the 2,228 deaths 517 or 23.2 per cent. were of infants under one year of age, and the rate of infant mortality measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to registered births was 125 per 1,000. This compares unfavourably with the figures of the last four years, but the marked decline shown in them was unquestionably in part due to the prevailing cold summers, and, as was remarked in my last report, no definite conclusion could be drawn as to what extent infantile mortality had been influenced by the efforts made of recent years to reduce it, until we had experienced some hot and dry summers. Last year was remarkable for its high summer temperature which was, as in previous years, accompanied by an excessive mortality from summer diarrhœa, to which the rise in the death-rate was due, there being 44 deaths per 1,000 births from diarrhœa and enteritis in 1911, compared with 16 per 1,000 in 1910, and an average of 29 per 1,000 in the four years 1907-10. High as this mortality is, it was exceeded of late years in both 1904 and 1906, and if the diagram showing the infantile mortality from all causes in Fulham since 1886 be referred to, it will seem that, notwithstanding the unfavourable season, there was a marked decline in 1911 compared with the rates prevailing between 1886 and 1906, which may in a large part be fairly attributed to the work which has been directed to the removal of conditions detrimental to infant life. The disastrous effect of the prolonged and excessive heat of 1911 can be judged by comparing the rates for the four quarters of the year:— Deaths under one year per 1000 births. First quarter 95 Second quarter 83 Third quarter 218 Fourth quarter 104 18 The corresponding rates of the County of London, the adjoining boroughs and other localities, were as under:— Deaths under one year per 1000 births. Fulham 125 Chelsea 109 Hammersmith 146 Kensington 133 County of London 129 77 Great Towns 140 136 Smaller Towns 133 England and Wales 130 In thirteen Metropolitan boroughs against nine in 1910, the mortality was higher than in Fulham, the rates ranging from 78 in Hampstead and 97 in Woolwich to 157 in Poplar and 170 in Shoreditch.

Of these 2,025 or 63.9 per cent, were notified by midwives, 976 or 30.8 percent, by medical practitioners and 169 or 5.3 per cent, by the fathers or some other relative. I regret again to have to point out that the Council still decline to avail themselves fully of the information obtained under this Act by refusing to appoint a Health Visitor, who could devote her whole time to visiting mothers and giving advice as to the proper care and management of babies, a step again urged without success in a report presented to the Public Health Committee last summer which has been advocated by the Local Government Board and has been uniformly successful wherever tried. From a return lately issued 20 by the Borough Council of Greenwich it appears that in 17 London boroughs one or more Health Visitors have been appointed, and there is a unanimous consensus of opinion as to their great utility and to the appreciation of their services shown by the mothers visited, while similar reports come from nearly all the provincial towns, and in face of this it is difficult to understand the attitude of the Council. Voluntary efforts have fortunately to some extent compensated for the neglect by the Sanitary Authority, and the efforts made by the Fulham School for Mothers deserve cordial recognition. The report of its Committee for 1911, shows a noticeable progress in the character of the work done and the success attained. To the consultations held at 92 Greyhound Road and the branch at Broughton Road Hall, 483 babies were brought who were seen by one or other of the three Honorary Medical Officers, who give their services, and 4,393 attendances were recorded, an increase as compared with 1910 of 157 babies and 2,106 attendances. So far as could be ascertained 20 deaths occurred among the children registered at the Consultations, so that whereas 11.5 per cent, of the babies born attended the School, only 4 per cent, of the deaths in the borough of infants under one year of age occurred among them, and even if all the deaths of infants under four weeks of age be eliminated, which admits of a fairer comparison, the mortality of the School babies was less than half that of those not attending. Especial importance is attached by the Committee to the necessity for supplementing the advice given at the Consultations by home supervision, and so impressed were they by the contrast between the results obtained during the epidemic period last year, in the cases in which by frequent visiting the Superintendent was able to ensure the doctor's instructions being carried out, and those in which little or no home supervision could be exercised, that they have decided to appoint another Health Visitor, who will be able to 21 devote her whole time to this work. The value of figures relating to one years work must not of course be overestimated, but when it is remembered that practically all who attend are the children of parents in poor and often distressed circumstances with more or less unsatisfactory home conditions, the results obtained should stimulate the Council to further extend this educational work. Deaths of Illegitimate Infants Of the children who died before attaining the age of one year 66 were illegitimate, the mortality among them being in the proportion of 330 deaths per 1,000 deaths against 112 per 1,000 among children born in wedlock. The subjoined table gives the causes of deaths of illegitimate children, from which it will be seen that the rate of the diarrhoeal mortalitv of the illegitimate was nearly five times that of the legitimate :— 22 TABLE XI.

To the seven principal epidemic diseases 369 deaths were ascribed, representing a death-rate of 2.41 per 1,000, which is 0.13 per 1,000 below the mean rate of the decennium 1901—1910. The corresponding rate of the County of London was 2.29 and in the metropolitan boroughs the rates ranged from 0.8 in Hampstead to 3.8 in Shoreditch.

There has been no case of Small-pox in Fulham since 1903. There was an outbreak of the disease in the East of London in the end of February, arising from an unrecognised case admitted into the Mile End Infirmary, whence 28 cases were subsequently removed. Consequent on this Chicken-pox was made a compulsorily notifiable disease by the London County Council for a period of three months from March 21st, during which period 104 cases were notified.

SCARLET FEVER. The notified cases of scarlet fever numbered 384 compared with 594, 511, and 354 in the three preceding years. The returns for the four quarters were :— Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 58 2 2nd „ 98 1 3rd „ 86 2 4th „ 142 1 384 6 The cases occurred in 327 houses as under :— Houses with one case 282 ,, ,, two cases 34 ,, ,, three ,, 10 „ „ four „ 1 32 Isolation. Of the patients notified 352 or 91.7 per cent, were removed to hospital for treatment. Fatality. The deaths, 6 in number, represent a case mortality of 1.6 per cent., which is the lowest recorded. During November and December there was a special incidence of the disease in children attending Peterborough School, 14 cases being notified in the Infants', four in the Girls', and one in the Boys' Department. The children attending the affected classes were examined but no " missed " cases were detected. DIPHTHERIA. The cases of diphtheria notified in the four quarters of the year were as under: — Cases. Deaths. 1st Quarter 89 6 2nd „ 68 5 3rd „ 60 4 4th „ 94 12 311 27 The case-rate was 20.2 per 10,000 inhabitants, compared with 16.2 in 1910, and an average of 27 per 10,000 in the decennium 1901-1910. The cases occurred in 274 houses as under:— Houses with one case 247 „ two cases 23 ,, three „ 3 „ four „ ... „ five „ 1 274 Chart Shewing Week by Week the Number of Cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria.

Fatality. The disease was notably more fatal than in 1910, the 87 deaths representing a case mortality of 8.7 per cent, as compared with 5.4 per cent, in that year. Diphtheria Antitoxin. Under the powers given by the Diphtheria Antitoxin Order, 1910, antitoxin was supplied to medical practitioners for use in 25 cases. ENTERIC FEVER The cases notified as enteric fever in 1911 numbered 38, or 2.4 per 10,000 inhabitants compared with an average of 4 per 10,000 in the preceding ten years, but of these 6 were afterwards found not to be suffering from the disease, while 2 of the 3 cases notified as continued fever were cases of typhoid. In 10 cases the illness appeared to have been contracted outside the borough. In 2 instances the patient was infected by a previous case in the family. Six patients had eaten shellfish—3 winkles, 1 oysters, 1 cockles and 1 mussels—within a fortnight of the commencement of the illness. Fatality.—The disease caused 8 deaths, representing a case mortality of 23.5 per cent. 34 PUERPERAL FEVER. Of puerperal septicæmia 23 cases were notified during the year, or 57 per 1000 births, of which 7 or 1.7 per 1,000 births proved fatal. As was the case in 1909 and 1910 more cases were notified in Fulham in proportion to the population than in any other metropolitan borough. ERYSIPELAS. 115 persons were notified as suffering from erysipelas, and 4 deaths were attributed to the disease. CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. Three cases were notified, all terminating fatally. In London in 1911, 101 cases were notified, with 8 deaths, but there was no evidence of the spread of the disease from any of the notified cases. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. The occurrence in epidemic form of this disease, which has long been known under the name of "infantile paralysis," and its liability to be confused with cerebrospinal fever, rendered it advisable that it should be added to the schedule of notifiable diseases; and accordingly it was made a compulsorily notifiable disease by the London County Council from September 1st, 1911. One fatal case, the nature of which was confirmed by histological examination of the spinal cord, was notified in Walham Ward, the patient being a youth of eighteen. There was no evidence as to any source of infection, and no spread of the disease. Prior to September 1st two deaths from infantile paralysis were registered. 35 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Inflammation of the eyes in the newly-born, to which a large proportion of blindness is due, was made a compulsorily notifiable disease in March, 1911. The cases are also reported by midwives to the Medical Officer of the London County Council, and in severe cases arrangements are at once made by the Inspectors under the Midwives Act for removal to hospital. Cases kept at home which may require any special treatment are reported by me to the Fulham and Hammersmith District Nursing Association, and their nursing is undertaken by the nurses of that institution. Fifteen cases were notified in 1911, of which 6 were treated in hospital. All the cases reported made a complete recovery. PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS. The past year has been notable for important developments in connection with the prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis. In March, 1911, the Local Government Board extended the system of notification, previously limited to cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law institutions, or amongst persons under the care of district medical officers, to cases occurring amongst the in-patients or out-patients at hospitals, or other similar institutions for the treatment of the sick, which are supported wholly or partially otherwise than by the contributions of the patients (or of their relatives or guardians), and otherwise than from rates and taxes. In November the Board issued further regulations completing the system inaugurated in 1908, requiring every medical practitioner, after January 1st, 1912, to notify every case of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring in the course of his public or of his private practice. 36 During the year the following notifications were received under the Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908 From the Fulham Infirmary— On admission 232 On discharge 102 From other Poor Law Institutions— On admission 6 On discharge 9 From District Medical Officers 186 From Relieving Officers 2 537 The certificates related to 268 patients—187 males and 81 females. Under the Tuberculosis Regulations of March, 1911, 372 certificates were received—131 from the Fulham Dispensary, 123 from Brompton Hospital, and the remainder from other hospitals and sanatoria. Of these 50 were re-notifications, making the number of hospital patients notified 322, and 56 of these were also notified by Poor Law Officers. In addition 47 cases were notified voluntarily by medical practitioners, 15 of which were also notified under the Regulations, and 57 cases of suspected tuberculosis among children attending school were reported by the Medical Officer (Education) of the London County Council, 10 of whom were notified by hospitals. The total number of patients brought under the notice of the Sanitary Authority, including the suspected cases among children was 613, of whom 368 were males and 245 females. 37 Mortality from Tuberculosis. 223 deaths (133 of males and 90 of females) were registered from phthisis (tuberculosis of the lungs), being 27 in excess of the average number in the five years 1906— 1910. The distribution of the deaths was as under:— Males. Females. Deaths in Poor Law Institutions 63 34 Deaths in Hospitals 11 11 Deaths in Asylums 8 5 Deaths at Home 51 40 133 90 To other tuberculous diseases 74 deaths were ascribed. In the several wards of the borough the death-rates from phthisis and other tuberculous diseases were as under:— TABLE XIX. Deaths per 1,000 of the population of each Ward from Phthisis and other Tuberculous Diseases. Death-rate from Phthisis. Death-rate from other Tuberculous Diseases.

Tuberculosis Dispensary. It is gratifying to record that the efforts which I stated in my last report were being made to establish in Fulham a tuberculosis dispensary, on the lines of the Royal Victoria Dispensary for Consumption in Edinburgh, proved successful and on November 1st the Fulham Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption was opened at 632 Fulham Road. The Committee were fortunate in securing the services of Dr. Waudby Griffin as Medical Officer, and already the need for the institution has been amply proved, and its work is full of promise for the future benefit of the borough. The essential features of the tuberculosis dispensary, as outlined in my last report, may be briefly repeated. Its functions are to examine patients and classify them as far as possible so that each may secure appropriate treatment, whether at home, in hospital, or in sanatorium; to act in co¬operation with all charitable and other organizations in the borough for the benefit of the patient; to examine all persons living in close contact with patients, which leads to the detection of cases, otherwise neglected, at such an early stage of the disease that it may be successfully treated; to visit the homes of the patients, and in co¬operation with the sanitary authority to amend any unhealthy condition of environment; to act as an information bureau and educational centre to which persons interested may turn for information and guidance. During November and December 202 patients attended the dispensary, of whom 131 were found to be tuberculous and were notified. 81 contacts were examined, and 14 cases of phthisis discovered among them. 39 It is noteworthy that 50, or 38 per cent., of those notified from the dispensary were children under ten years of age, while of those notified as definitely phthisical from other sources, only 5 per cent. were children of this age. The importance of the detection of these early cases, which in the past have been largely overlooked, cannot be overestimated, as although tuberculosis has hitherto been considered especially a disease of adolescence and early maturity, there is now a mass of evidence showing that its presence in childhood is very common, and that in a large proportion of cases its active manifestation in later years is the result of the lightingup of an infection which has existed in the system for a long time. Sanatorium Accommodation. An important step in dealing with tuberculosis has been recently taken by the Council by their decision to retain from April 1st, 1912, six beds at the National Sanatorium, Benenden, Kent, for the use of persons residing in the borough suffering from tuberculosis, at a yearly cost of £78 per bed. Open¬Air Shelters. The Council have also provided two portable shelters for use in backyards or gardens. These can be used for more or less advanced cases to lessen the risk of infection, for the treatment of early cases which cannot be sent to a sanatorium, or for the continuation of sanatorium treatment at home; and their more extended use should be of great value in the treatment of tuberculosis. Spitting bottles, paper handkerchiefs and disinfectants are also supplied by the Council to sufferers from phthisis who are in poor circumstances. c 2 40 National Insurance Act, 1911. The provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1911, will in the near future materially assist the local authority in dealing with the problem of tuberculosis. Section 16 requires Insurance Committees to make arrangements to the satisfaction of the Insurance Commissioners with a view to providing treatment for insured persons suffering from tuberculosis (a) in sanatoria and other institutions, with persons or local authorities (other than Poor Law authorities) having the management of sanatoria or other institutions approved by the Local Government Board, (b) otherwise than in sanatoria or other institutions, with persons and local authorities (other than Poor Law authorities) undertaking such treatment in a manner approved by the Local Government Board. The same section provides, for the purpose of defraying the expense of providing this treatment, the sum of 15. 3d. per annum in respect of each insured person payable out of the insurance fund. A further sum of 1d. in respect of each insured person is available from the Exchequer, but may be allocated by the Insurance Commissioners to research. It is further provided that insured persons cannot claim treatment as a matter of right, but must be recommended for sanatorium benefit by the appropriate Insurance Committee. Section 17 enables Insurance Committees, if they think fit, to extend similar treatment to the dependants of the insured, or to any class of such dependants, and if the sums made available by section 16 are not sufficient to provide for the treatment of such dependants, the deficit may be made up in equal shares out of moneys provided by Parliament and out of money derived from the county or borough rates, provided that the expenditure occasioning the deficit has received the sanction of the Treasury and of the council of the county or county borough. 41 Report of Royal Commission. The Royal Commission on Human and Animal Tuberculosis issued its final report in July, 1911. After a series of exhaustive experiments and investigations the Commissioners find that tuberculosis in men and in cattle must unquestionably be pronounced one and the same disease, and that a large proportion of the tuberculosis of early life must be attributed to infection with bacilli of the bovine type transmitted to children in meals consisting largely of the milk of the cow. They state that they are convinced that measures for securing the prevention of ingestion of living bovine bacilli with milk, would greatly reduce the number of cases of abdominal and cervical gland tuberculosis in children, and that such measures should include the exclusion from the food supply of the milk of the recognisably tuberculous cow, irrespective of the site of the disease, whether in the udder or in the internal organs. SICKNESS AND DEATHS FROM NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Measles. The deaths from measles in the four quarters of the year were:— 1st Quarter 25 2nd ,, 21 3rd „ 4 4th „ 1 64 The death-rate was 0.42 per 1,000, being 0.15 below that of the County of London and 0.10 below the average rate in Fulham during the previous 10 years. Owing to the special prevalence of the disease throughout 42 London in the beginning of the year a Conference was held on March 13th, at the Local Government Board Offices, at which the President of the Local Government Board and the Medical Officer, Dr. Newsholme, discussed with the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health the preventive measures that could be adopted. The question of notification was considered, but the Board did not order its adoption as a very large number of cases are not attended by a Doctor, and in such cases notification would be a dead letter, and, moreover, notification of measles has been tried in a large number of towns and then abandoned. It was thought that the information obtained from schools might be made more readily available, and the Board arranged with the Board of Education that the School Attendance Officers should give speedy information to the Medical Officers of Health of all cases of illness coming under their notice. Having regard to the high fatality of measles among children under five and the saving of life there would be, if the attack could be postponed to a later age, there was a general consensus of opinion as to the advisability of excluding children under five from elementary schools. Hospital Treatment of Measles. In 1910 the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board were empowered by the Local Government Board to receive into their hospitals children suffering from measles or whooping cough, who are either in the institutions of the Poor Law Guardians or can be admitted into a Poor Law Infirmary by order of the Relieving Officers, and in May, 1911, the Local Government Board made a further Order requiring the Managers to admit cases of measles recommended by the Medical Officer of Health,provided they have more accommodation available than is required for the reception of pauper patients suffering from measles. Consequent upon this, a circular letter was addressed to the medical practitioners practising in 43 Fulham asking them to acquaint the Medical Officer with any cases under their care whose removal they considered desirable. The epidemic was practically over when the Order was made and only 12 cases were removed at my request, but in future epidemics the provision of hospital accommodation for cases of measles, which has frequently been advocated in these reports, will doubtless result in the saving of many lives. 576 cases were reported by the Schools, and, in addition to excluding from school attendance all children from infected houses who were attending the infant classes, and also the children from the same houses in the boys' or girls' departments who had not had measles, the following classes were closed during the periods stated :— 44 Class-rooms closed on Account of Measles during 1911.

The death-rate from the disease in Fulham was 0.18 against 0.23 in the County of London. Diarrhoea. The deaths from diarrhoea and enteritis in the four quarters of the year were :— Number of Deaths. Death-rate. 1st Quarter 5 0.13 2nd „ 12 0.31 3rd „ 199 5.20 4th 20 0.52 Of the deaths 211 were of children under two years of age representing a death-rate of 1.38 per 1,000 of the population against 1.18 per 1,000 in the County of London, while of the metropolitan boroughs ten had higher rates than Fulham, compared with nine in 1910 and four in 1909. As the result: of enquiries respecting the deaths from diarrhoea of 59 children under six months of age it was found that only one was breast fed. Of the others 22 were fed on cow's milk, 29 on condensed milk, and 6 on some form of patent food. Prevention of Diarrhæa. In August last the Local Government Board issued a circular to local authorities respecting the excessive child mortality from diarrhoea and enteritis accompanying the hot and dry summer. In it the Board emphasised the importance of exact advice being given as to the feeding and management of children and more generally as to preventing the exposure of their food to contamination from decomposing organic matter. In this connection 46 they considered the distribution of clearly-worded leaflets useful, but of still more importance "personal visits and the offer of practical advice to the mothers of babies born within the last twelve months." The necessity for efficient scavenging was pointed out, and for "the frequent and, if practicable, daily" removal of house and stable refuse, especially in the areas in which diarrhoea is specially prevalent. As I have already stated, owing to the Council not having appointed a Health Visitor, it was not possible in Fulham to carry out efficiently the recommendation of the Board as to personal visiting, but a leaflet on the prevention of diarrhoea, which is printed in the appendix, was distributed before the issue of the circular, and the Surveyor kept the courts and avenues regularly scavenged and flushed. A more frequent removal of house refuse in the summer months has been repeatedly urged in these reports, and arrangements for this should be made by the Council without further delay. DEATHS FROM OTHER DISEASES. Influenza. Nineteen deaths were certified to be due to influenza, the numbers for the preceding three years being 33, 22, and 28. Cancer. Malignant diseases caused 171 deaths, representing a death-rate of 1.12 per 1,000 against a decennial average of 1.03. Diseases of the Respiratory System. From these diseases there were 373 deaths, or 16.7 per cent. of the deaths from all causes, being 50 below the decennial average. 47 Violence. The deaths of Fulham residents from accident or negligence numbered 77, of which 10 were of infants suffocated when in bed with their parents. Other classes of diseases caused the following deaths :— Venereal Diseases 18 Diseases of the Nervous System 88 Diseases of the Circulatory System 273 Diseases of the Digestive System 95 Diseases of the Urinary System 84 CERTIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH. Of the 2,228 deaths registered, 2,054 or 92.2 per cent. were certified by registered medical practitioners and 173 by Coroners after inquest, only one death, that of a child of two from measles, being uncertified. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Fulham Infirmary and Workhouse. The deaths of 500 persons, 281 males and 219 females, occurred in Fulham Infirmary, and of 36, 24 males and 12 females in the Workhouse Of these 528 belonged to Fulham and 8 to other districts.

The 211 milkshops on the register have been kept under supervision by your Food Inspector. In shops in which other articles besides dairy produce are sold the covered counter pans are required to be kept in glass cabinets. Ice Creams. The registered premises where ice creams are made or stored number 145. They were regularly supervised and 14 notices of defects detected were served upon the occupiers. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. The licences of the undermentioned cowsheds and slaughterhouses were renewed by the London County Council in October, no objections being raised by the Borough Council : — Cowsheds. Premises.

Unsound Food. The stalls and shops where food is sold or stored were regularly inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors in rotation. A quantity of unsound meat found in the ice safe of a butcher was seized by your Food Inspector and condemned by the Magistrate, but the summons against the owner was dismissed on the ground that it was doubtful whether the meat was intended for the food of man. A costermonger was summoned for exposing for sale unsound pears and fined £2 and 2s. costs. 57 The following articles examined at the request of the owners were condemned and destroyed :— 17 boxes of fish. 10 cases of fruit. Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The undermentioned samples were purchased for analysis in 1911 :— Article. Number of Samples taken Officially. Number Adulterated.

The average composition of the samples purchased as new milk in each of the four quarters was as under:— Solids other than Fat. Fat. Water. 1st Quaiter 8.71 3.40 87.89 2nd „ 8.55 3.62 87.83 3rd „ 8.78 3.45 87.77 4th „ 8.96 3.50 87.60 No proceedings were instituted by the Council in respect of two samples certified to be deficient in fat to the extent of 8 per cent, and 9 per cent, respectively. Having regard to the average composition of the milk sold in Fulham, it cannot be contended that the standard laid down by the Board of Agriculture, viz., 8.5 per cent, of solids other than fat, and 3 per cent, of fat is unduly high, and there is a danger that if excessive leniency is shown with respect to samples certified as well below the standard, the quality of the milk supplied in the borough will deteriorate. 59 There was a further diminution in the proportion of adulterated samples of butter, only 3.2 per cent, being reported against, compared with 6 per cent, in 1910 and 8 per cent, in 1909. The vigorous action of your Food Inspector has been instrumental in greatly checking these very mean frauds. The proportion of adulterated samples was much swollen by the samples of sausages of various kinds and potted meats being certified as adulterated owing to the presence of Boric Acid, but in no instance did the amount of Boric Acid found exceed 0.25 per cent. The two prescriptions certified as adulterated were deficient to the extent of 13 per cent, and 15 per cent, in the active ingredient, viz., Sodium Salicylate, but proceedings were not taken against the dispensers by the Council. Prosecutions under the Sale of Foods and Drugs Acts were instituted in the following cases:— 60 Defendant. Offence. Result. Penalty. Costs. Walter A.

The number of dwelling-houses inspected under and for the purposes of Section 17 of the above Act was as under: Number of houses inspected. Number of houses unfit for habitation. Number of representations. Number of Closing Orders. Number of houses in which defects were remedied without Closing Orders. Number of houses in which defects were remedied after Closing Orders. Number of houses demolished. Number of houses in which repairs were not completed on Dec. 31st, 1911. 157 43 43 38 91 10 19 24 The following were the houses represented by me as being in such a state as to be unfit for human habitation:— Houses represented as unfit for habitation. Action of Council. Subsequent Action. 18, Peterborough Road Closing Order made Demolished. 2, 4, 6, 8, 22, 24, 26 and 28, Burlington Road Closing Orders made Repaired. Closing Orders determined. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Burlington Gardens No Closing Order made. Owner undertaking to demolish houses in 6 months Demolished. 1, 2, 3 and 4, Elysium Street Closing Orders made Nos. 1 & 2 repaired. Closing Orders determined. Nos. 3 & 4 demolished. 30b, 30m, 30t, 32b, 32m, 32t, 34b, 34m, 34t, 36b, 36m, 36t, 38b, 38m, 38t, Langford Road Closing Orders made Closed. No Demolition Orders made. 8,9,10,11, 12 and 13, Hatfield Street Closing Orders made Closed. No Demolition Orders made. 62 Fourteen houses in Parson's Green Lane, the consideration of the representation of which had, as mentioned in my Report for 1910, been adjourned on the undertaking of the owner to close them within six months, were closed as arranged and eleven of them have been demolished. With regard to the houses in respect of which closing orders have been made and no steps have been taken within 3 months to render them fit for habitation, it has been pointed out to the Council that Section 18 of the Act requires them in such cases "to take into consideration the question of the demolition of the house, and if upon such consideration they are of opinion that the dwelling-house has not been rendered fit for habitation and that the necessary steps are not being taken with all due diligence to render it so fit, or that the continuance of any building being or being part of the dwellinghouse is a nuisance, or dangerous, or injurious to the health of the public, or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring houses, they shall order the demolition of the building." Several months have passed since closing orders made in respect of some of the houses represented under the Act became operative, but although steps have not been taken to render them fit for habitation, no demolition orders have been made by the Council. Underground Rooms used as Sleeping Places. Regulations in respect of underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places have been made by the Council, pursuant to Section 17 (7) of the Act, and submitted to the Local Government Board for approval. Housing A ccommodation. Four blocks of tenements are in course of erection in Lillie Road by the Peabody Trustees, and will probably be ready for occupation about the middle of the year. 63 The accommodation provided and the rents which, as I am informed, will be charged are as under:— Rent inclusive of Rates. S. d. Tenements of four rooms 14 8 9 per week. „ „ three „ 68 6 9 ,, ,, „ „ two „ 108 5 8 „ „ „ „ one „ 50 8 9 „ „ Drainage of Buildings. During the year the following drainage plans were submitted to and approved by the Public Health Committee:— Plans of drainage of new houses 215 „ „ ,, „ blocks of flats 12 „ ,, ,, „ workshops, etc. 10 ,, „ „ „ public buildings 5 ,, ,, „ ,, additions to existing buildings 27 ,, „ the reconstruction of the drainage of existiug buildings 160 429 Combined Drainage. Five systems of combined drainage, for which the Council was liable, were reconstructed at a cost of £78 5s. Od., the work being carried out by a contractor under a schedule of prices The sum of, £105 4s. Od. was also paid to owners in respect of work executed by them at 20 houses in compliance with notices served by the Council in connection with house drains which were "sewers" as defined by the Metropolitan Management Act, 1895. 64 Water Supply in Tenement Houses. An additional water supply on upper floors was required and provided in 15 tenement houses, under section 78 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, by which a sufficient supply of water can be required on each separately occupied floor of a tenement house. Houses Let in Lodging. New bye-laws in respect of houses let in lodgings are being draughted as the unsatisfactory nature of the exemption clause renders the existing bye-laws useless. Certificates under the Revenue Acts. Applications were received for certificates under the Revenue Acts for exemption from an abatement of inhabited house duty in respect of 384 tenements, of which 217 were granted, 107 were given after certain specified works had been completed, and 60 were refused. Certificates in respect of 725 dwellings, which had been granted for a limited period, were renewed. REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. The service for the removal of house refuse has been well maintained, and but few complaints of failure to remove it on the regular days have been received, but as I have already stated when dealing with diarrhœal mortality a more frequent collection during the summer months is badly needed. A more liberal interpretation of what constitutes "house refuse" is also desirable, as we not infrequently have complaints of such things as old mattresses, often offensive and verminous, being left in the yards of houses owing to the refusal of the dustmen to remove them except on payment, on the ground that they are not "house refuse." In my opinion such things are covered by the definition of house refuse in 65 the Public Health (London) Act, where it is said to mean ashes, "rubbish" and filth, but be that as it may, it seems hardly worth while for the sanitary authority to strain the point, and, for the sake of a few pence, haggle over the question of the responsibility for the removal of filthy rubbish. CLEANSING OF CHILDREN. As the Borough Council declined to co-operate with them in carrying out a scheme for the cleansing of school children infested with vermin, the London County Council have provided a cleansing station in Sedlescombe Road, which was opened on January 16th, 1912. The names and addresses of the children who are cleansed are forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health, and their houses are cleansed under the powers given by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1901, Part IV., and the bedding, etc., disinfected at the Council's station. The system should tend to prevent school infection and will furnish the Sanitary Authority with valuable information as to houses requiring supervision. SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The urinals attached to public houses and accessible to the public have been regularly inspected and a notice served under Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, requiring the reconstruction of a convenience, has been complied with. OFFENSIVE TRADES. None of the offensive trades specified in Section 19 of the Public Health (London) Act are carried on in Fulham. A complaint was received respecting the nuisance caused by a Rag and Bone Dealer at a shop in 66 New King's Road, and I certified the business as a nuisance under Section 21 of the Public Health (London) Act, but it was not necessary to take proceedings as the business was discontinued. SMOKE ABATEMENT. Seven intimation and three statutory notices were served under the Public Health (London) Act in respect of smoke nuisances. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. 760 complaints were received and dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors, and 1,294 intimation and 279 statutory notices were served. The following summary has been prepared at the request of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council:— PREMISES. NUMBER OF PLACES. Number of Inspections. 1911. Number of Notices 1911.

The Chief Clerk of the Public Health Department, Mr. George Clarke, who had been in the service of the Council since 1891, died suddenly in July last. In his place the Council appointed Mr. A. Hurford, who had been Junior Clerk in the Department since 1907, and Mr. T. H. Robey was selected for the latter post. I am, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. CHARLES JACKSON.

Public Health department. SUMMER DIARRHŒA IN INFANTS. Hundreds of babies die in London during the summer from diarrhœa and sickness, which may, with proper care, be prevented, but cannot always be cured. If the following instructions are carried out mothers may hope to save their babies from dying of these complaints. Breast-fed Babies. Diarrhœa and sicknes are much more common in bottle-fed than in breast-fed babies, therefore mothers should always suckle their babies when possible for eight or nine months, and they should, not be weaned during the hot weather. To prevent Diarrhœa in Breast-fed Babies. Suckle the baby regularly, not every time it cries. Give the baby nothing but the breast milk and water to drink. Wash the breasts and nipples before and after suckling. Wash the inside of the baby's mouth with a clean wet rag after nursing. Any dirt entering the mouth may produce diarrhœa. Do not therefore let babies suck dirty teats, comforters, or thumbs. 93 To strengthen herself, the mother should take milk and plain food, not beer or spirits. Nursing mothers should avoid overwork and fatigue, and should remember that worrying or quarrelling may spoil their milk and give the baby diarrhœa. Bottle-fed Babies. Summer diarrhœa in infants is chiefly due to bad milk, unsuitable food and dirty feeding-bottles and teats. In hot weather milk turns quickly sour or becomes tainted by dust, dirt and flies, and may easily bring on diarrhœa unless the following precautions are observed:— Buy the milk twice a day, and get the best you can, as cheap milk is dangerous. Boil it at once for two minutes. Keep it in a covered vessel, which should be stood in a basin of cold water, in a cool place. Alway's taste the milk in a spoon before putting it into the bottle, to see that it has not turned sour. Bottles with tubes should never be used Boat-shaped bottles are the best. The bottle should be scalded out after use, and the teat should be turned inside out and washed, and kept with the bottle under cold water. When fresh cow's milk cannot be obtained, or the milk has turned sour, used dried milk (Glaxo) or the best condensed milk. Get small tins of condensed milk, as after the tin is opened the milk will soon go bad. Cover an open tin with clean muslin, to protect it from dirt and flies. 94 In very hot weather it Is advisable to diminish the amount of milk given, either by adding more water or by lessening the quantity of each meal, and to make up the deficiency in fluid by giving cold water at intervals; and it should be remembered that babies are often thirsty, especially in hot weather, and cry fretfully, not from hunger, but from thirst, and they are soothed at once by a drink of cold water. In any case of sudden diarrhœa, stop the milk at once, and give only plain water, which has been boiled, and take the baby to a doctor without delay. Do not think that the diarrhœa will pass off, as the baby may be so ill in a few hours that no treatment will be of any use. General Precautions. Cleanliness in the home is essential. The floors of all rooms, passages and stairways should be frequently washed with soap and water, and dirty walls and ceilings should be scraped and limewashed. No decomposing refuse should be allowed to remain in the house or its neighbourhood, and all vegetable refuse should be burnt in the kitchen fire The drains should be frequently flushed, and any obstruction or fault in them should be at once reported to the Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walham Green, as well as any omission in the removal of house refuse and the existence of any other offensive nuisance. House Flies, which carry on their bodies the filth with which they have been in contact and the germs of disease, should be as far as possible exterminated.
