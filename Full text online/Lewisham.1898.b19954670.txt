From 1856 to 1866 the sum raised was £32,223, at £5 per cent, per annum. In the next period, to the end of 1876, the sum raised was £87,844, and the interest was 5 per cent, at the earty part of the decade, and 4¼ and 37/8 at the latter part. Following this, the sum of £68,268 was raised in the ten years ended December, 1886, and the interest was, in the first half of this period, 4½ and 4¼, but in the latter part it was 3½. This sum of £68,268 included £24,800 raised under a scheme submitted by Mr. T. W. Williams, then Chairman of the Finance Committee, and approved by the Board, for the consolidation of previous loans borrowed at rates of 4|, 4¼, and 4¼, and the new loan was obtained at 33/4. The sum therefore raised for new works in the third period, from 1876 to the end of 1886, was £43,468.

Progress has been made in this matter during the year. In November the Board received a further report from their Special Committee, of which the following is a copy:— "The Committee, in their report to the Board on the 10th February, 1897, stated that they had had before them for some time the absolute necessity for the extension of the Board's Offices to meet the present and future requirements of the District, and they then recommended that the Board should acquire the plot of freehold land at the rear of the present Offices for the purpose of such extension. "The recommendation was adopted by the Board, and the ground was duly acquired. Proceedings were at the same time taken for stopping up the old footpath intervening between the piece of ground and the present buildings, and this was carried into effect as reported by the Committee to the Board on the 10th Nov., 1897 (Min., par. 17). In that report the Committee expressed a hope that they would be able at an early date to submit to the Board recommendations with reference to the enlargement of the Town Hall, which subject was engaging their earnest attention. "The Committee accordingly proceeded with the consideration of the matter, and they have held numerous meetings, and very carefully considered all the circumstances of the case. 19 "The questions which prominently presented themselves to the Committee were:— (1) What additional accommodation was necessary to mee.t the Board's own requirements ? (2) Whether provision should be made for grouping all the Authorities of the Parish together under one roof ? (3) Whether the Committee should confine their consideration to the present needs only, or (4) Whether they should recommend provision for the future growth of the District ? "The present Offices were designed in 1874 to meet the requirements of the District Board, and little, if any, provision, was made for the extended growth of the District. Immediately after the Board came into possession of the building, arrangements were made for letting off a portion of the same to the Guardians of the Poor of the Parish of Lewisham, and, since that date, several other Authorities have come into existence and require office accommodation, and the number of Members of the Vestry has been increased from 36 to 120, and that of the District Board from 27 to 48. "The enormous growth of the District, and the vast increase in the business to be transacted, call imperatively for an immediate enlargement of the Town Hall, and the Committee are of opinion that ample provision should be made, not only for the present, but also for the future requirements of the District. "Taking these matters into consideration, the Committee, unanimously, arrived at the following conclusions :— 1st—That provision should be made for grouping all the Authorities in Lewisham who now, generally, meet at the Town Hall, under one roof, and that office accommodation should be provided for them. 2nd—That provision should be made not only for immediate needs, but for the future growth of the District, and that the accommodation to be provided should be such as would, in all probability, meet the requirements for many years to come. "Proceeding upon these principles the Committee, in the first place, considered the question of the enlargement of the present Board Boom, the accommodation of which, since the date of the increased numbers in the Board and Vestry, has been found to be inadequate. 20 "The question, also, of providing a large Public-hall, to accommodate 1,500 or 2,000 people, called for by the importance and growing character of the District, was also taken into consideration. "The Committee are unanimously of opinion that only the administrative requirements should be dealt with at the present time, and that the proposal for a large hall may be deferred. "As to the enlargement of the Board Room, the Committee are of opinion that it should be extended some 20 feet northwards, so as to accommodate 120 Members, the present number of the Members of the Lewisham Vestry. The dimensions of the Board Room will then be 66-ft. 3-in. by 30 feet. "The Committee are also of opinion that on the same floor as the Board Room provision should be made for three Committee Rooms ; a Library or Member's Room ; a room for the Chairman ; a Public Waiting-room for Deputations, with Cloak-room, Lavatories, &c. "As to the Board's Officers, the Committee are of opinion that provision should be made for the departments as under :— (1) Clerk's Department. (2) Surveyors' Department. (3) Medical Officer of Health. (4) Sanitary Inspectors. "They are also of opinion that ample provision should be made for the Parochial Guardians and their Staff'; that a room should be provided for the Vestry Clerks; and that a room should be provided for the purposes of each of the following Authorities:— (1) Charity Trustees. (3) Baths Committee. (2) Burial Board. (4) Libraries Committee. ''In addition to this accommodation, the Committee are of opinion that there should be increased storage in the base- ment for the documents and records of the Board and other Authorities ; that there should be a public waiting room on the ground floor, with lavatory, &c. ; and also that additional accommodation for the housekeeper be provided. ' The Committee requested the Board's Surveyor to prepare plans and elevations in accordance with these various suggestions; this he has done, and the plans and elevations are submitted herewith. " The Surveyor estimates the cost of the proposed alterations and additions, approximately, at £18,000. 21 "The Committee recommend (1) That the Town Hall be enlarged in accordance with the suggestions embodied in the report. (2) That having regard to the importance of the work, and the responsibility of the Board in connection therewith, a Consulting Architect be appointed, who shall be a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, to confer with the Surveyor to the Board as to the plans and specifications prepared by him, and approved by the Committee, and to make any recommendations as to the details of the same he may consider essential, such recommendations, if any, to be reported to the Special Committee by the Surveyor, and, at the request of the Surveyor, or the Committee, to visit the works during their progress, and to advise as to any difficulty which may arise. (3) That it be referred to the Committee, with the assistance of the Surveyor and Architect, to have the requisite specifications prepared ; to have the quantities taken out by a qualified Quantity Surveyor, and to obtain tenders for the work, and submit same for the consideration of the Board. Plans and Elevations will be placed in the Board Room for inspection, and can be seen any time on Wednesday. "The general result of the proposed alterations may be summarised thus:— The present building comprises the Board Room, 2 Committee Rooms, 8 rooms used as Offices, together with lavatories and accommodation for the housekeeper. The enlarged building will comprise Board Room extended 20 feet, 3 Committee Rooms, 23 rooms available for Office accommodation, waiting rooms, members' rooms, together with increased accommodation in the way of lavatories, and for the housekeeper, and for storage of deeds, &c. "A Schedule, giving full details as to dimensions of the various Offices and rooms, can be seen in the Surveyor's Office. " {Signed), T. W. Williams, Chairman "9th Nov., 1898." This report was unanimously approved and adopted by the Board on the 16th November, 1898, and the Committee's recommendations were approved and adopted. 22 The Special Committee brought up a further report in February of the present year, as follows: — " The Committee have to report that Mr. E. W. Mountford has accepted the position of Consulting Architect in connection with the enlargement of the Town Hall, upon the terms set forth in their report of the 9th November, 1898. "The Committee have had an interview with Mr. Mountford, and, after consultation with the Board's Surveyor, they recommend a variation in the plans already submitted to the Board, to allow of The staircase to the public gallery being connected directly with the outside of the building, for the convenience of the public who may wish to attend the Meetings of the Board "Some other alterations of a minor character have been suggested. The Committee are considering these, and ask for authority to give effect to them, if, in their opinion, they are thought to be desirable. " (Signed) T. W. Williams, Chairman of the Committee." 18th January, 1899. This report was unanimously approved and adopted by the Board, and the authority asked for was given. The subject is still receiving the Committee's most careful consideration, and steps are being taken for obtaining tenders for the work. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. In pursuance of the undertaking given in the early part of the year, the Board in due course resumed their application to the Board of Trade for a Provisional Order, under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 to 1888. By this Order the Board seek power to supply electricily in the Lewisham District, for all public and private purposes, as defined by the Acts. The Board directed that all necessary steps be taken for carrying their resolution into effect ar.d in support of the application. The application was accordingly proceeded with and it duly received the sanction of the Board of Trade. 23 The Act confirming the Order has, at the time of writing this Report, passed both Houses of Parliament. The Board also received Notices from the Great "Western Electric Light and Power Company, Ltd., and the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Light Company, Ltd., of their intention to apply for Provisional Orders ; to both of which they replied that they were themselves applying for an Order. The County of London and Brush Company proceeded with their application The Board duly opposed it, mainly on the ground that they were applying for an Order, and in the result the Company's application was refused. This Company also promoted a Bill in Parliament by which they sought power (for the purpose of connecting portions of their districts with their generating stations) to lay down and maintain electric lines through other districts ; that is to say, power to pass through intervening Districts. This District was one of those scheduled in the Bill. The Board considered this proposal very objectionable, and presented a petition against it. The Bill was also very strongly opposed by the London County Council and other Local Authorities. As above stated, the Board opposed the application made by the same Company for a Provisional Order, and refused to give their consent to the Company's application. In consequence of this refusal the Board of Trade declined to sanction the Application. The Company thereupon withdrew this Board's District from the Schedule to their Bill; and the Bill was afterwards thrown out by the Committee of the House of Commons by whom it was considered. PUBLIC FOOTPATHS. With a view of preserving the public rights in footpaths in the District, the Board caused notice boards to be fixed indicating all such footpaths and the points to which they lead. 24 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS. The Board have had under their further consideration the question of the improvement of the Catford and Brockley Bridges, and the suggestion made by the London County Council that the Board should contribute towards the cost of the work. The Board agreed, in consideration of the Council reconstructing the bridges, that they would contribute one-fifth part of the cost. Subsequently a notice was received from the South Eastern Railway of a proposal made by them for widening their line of railway which affected the question of these bridges, and the matter has since been the subject of some negotiation between the Company and the Council, and is referred to in the Company's Widening Bill. The Board have had under consideration a proposal for widening the roadway in Dartmouth-road, Forest-hill, and agreed to make a contribution towards the cost of acquiring the ground in front of one of the houses, No. 63. The ground in front of the other numbers, 49 to 61, and 65 to 93 (odd numbers inclusive), having been given up and dedicated to the public by the owner on his building applications. The Improvement at the corner of Jews-walk and Kirkdale was also carried out during the year, the owners of the property having given up the ground for the purpose. In this case the Board pay the Sydenham Public Hall Company £50 for their interests in the ground ; but the freeholder, Mr. II. W. Forster, has consented to give up the ground, so far as his interest is concerned, free of any contribution by the public. The Board proposed and have agreed to erect a drinking fountain on part of this site. The Board also effected an Improvement at the entrance to Houston-road from Perry-hill. The road at this point was extremely narrow. This work has been carried out with the sanction of the London County Council. The Board are also arranging for the purchase of a piece of land at the entrance to Newlands-park, part of the 25 perty there called "Ellesraere House," by. which the road will be widened to the full width of 40 feet. LIGHT RAILWAYS. The Board have had their attention again called to this matter. The scheme proposed in the previous year was not proceeded with. Another scheme was submitted, by the Crystal Palace Light Railways Company, the plans being deposited at the Board's Offices on the 30th November, 1898. The Board thought this application very objectionable, and they decided to oppose it. Notice of objections and opposition was accordingly given by the Clerk and subsequently the Board received a communication from the Light Railway Commissioners stating that the Company had withdrawn their application. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The building of the Mortuary and Coroner's Court, referred to in the Committee's last Report, was duly completed during the year. Possession of the Coroner's Court was given to the London County County Council, on the 25th March, under the agreement entered into between the Council and the Board, by which the Court is leased to the Council for a period of 21 years, at the annual and inclusive rent of £95. The building has given every satisfaction, the Coroner, upon the first inquest held there, expressed himself in every way satisfied with the accommodation provided. SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY BILL. On the 30th November, plans and other papers were deposited at the Board's offices relating to the proposal made by the South Eastern Railway Company for constructing new, and widening existing, Railways in this District. The Board gave formal notice of their opposition to the scheme, and subsequently entered into negotiations with the Company with regard to the same, when arrangements were made with 26 the Company, which were considered satisfactory so far as this District was concerned. The terms arranged were ultimately embodied in an Agreement between the Company and the Board, which was duly executed. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES. The Board have had under consideration a suggestion for constructing a public sanitary convenience for both sexes, at the Obelisk at the junction of Loampit-vale and Highstreet, Lewisham. They have had the necessary plans, sections, and estimates submitted to them, which have been approved, and they have applied to the Local Government Board for their sanction to the borrowing of the sum required for the purpose. The estimated cost of this work is £1,800. SMOKE NUISANCES. Special attention has been given to the question of Smoke Nuisances in the District, and proceedings have been taken in several instances, with a view to the abatement of the same. SEWER AND OTHER WORKS. The Board have constructed a new sewer from Ladywell towards Brockley-rise, by agreement with the owners of the property to be drained, and the Board have under consideration a proposal for extending this Sewer to Brockley-rise. Particulars of these and other similar works will be found in the Surveyors' Reports. MEETINGS OF THE BOARD AND COMMITTEES.

H.P. HALL, Book-keeper. EDWD. WRIGHT, Clerk to the Board. REPORT to The Board of Works for the Lewisham District TO THE END OF THE YEAR 1898, by Dr. S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The number of deaths in the Lewisham District during the year 1898 was 1670 as compared with 1370 in 1897, being an increase of 300. The corrected death rate for 1898 was 14.0 per 1000, as compared with 12.2 per 1000 in 1897, which was the lowest on record. The increase in the number of deaths is accounted for by the epidemic of Influenza in the spring; the deaths from this disease amounting to 36 in 1898, as compared with 12 and 11 respectively in 1896 and 1897; and also to the increase in the deaths from zymotic disease from 218 in 1897 to 302 in 1898. This at first sight seems alarming; but it will be seen from the Tables that the increase was only in measles and diarrhœa, and a slight increase in whooping cough. The mortality from diarrhœa was very great among children under one year during the excessive heat in August and September. The deaths from the other zymotic diseases show a decrease, there being only 29 deaths from diphtheria in 1898, compared with 43 deaths in 1897 and 82 deaths in 1896. This decrease is, I feel sure, due to the early use of antitoxin, and also to early removal of cases to hospital. The deaths from typhoid also decreased from 10 in 1897 to 74 6 in 1898. The number of deaths from scarlet fever were the same as in the previous year, namely 9. There was one death from small-pox. This is the only death registered from that disease in the District since 1893. Population. The population of the Lewisham District, at the Census of 1891, was found to be 92,647, occupying 15,643 houses, distributed thus— Lewisham Parish, 72,272, occupying 12,317 houses, giving an average of 59 persons to each house, Hamlet of Penge 20,375, occupying 3,326 houses, giving an average of 6 1 persons to each house. At Midsummer, 1898, there were in Lewisham Parish 16,510 occupied houses, estimated to contain 97,409 persons, and in the Hamlet of Penge 3,579 occupied houses, estimated to contain 21,832 persons. Total, 20,089 occupied houses, and estimated population 119,230, being an increase of over 7,000 in the year. Inhabited Houses. Estimated Populaton. Lee 1,224 7,221 Lewisham 8,094 47,755 Sydenham 7,192 42,433 Penge 3,579 21,832 Births. The registered births in the District in the year 1898 amounted to 2,773, an increase of 85 on the previous year; of these 76, or 27 per cent., were illegitimate. Birth rate=23.3 per 1000. The birth rate in England and Wales in 1898 was 294 per 1,000 of the population, which is lower than that in any other year on record, and is 1.1 per 1,000 below the mean rate in the ten years, 1888—1897. 75 Deaths. The total number of deaths in 1898 was 1,670, as compared with 1,370 in 1897. Males 843 Females 827 Births. Deaths. Death Rate. Lewisham 1,244 762 15.9 Sydenham 971 491 11.5 Penge 442 291 13.3 Lee 116 126 17.4 The number of deaths in public institutions in the District amounted to 471; of these 198 were of persons who did not belong to the District. There were 247 deaths in the Lewisham Union Infirmary, 222 of which were of persons belonging to the District; of these 165 were residents in Lewisham Village; 43 were residents in the Sydenham Chapelry; 14 belonged to Lee; and none to Penge. The remaining 25 were of persons who did not belong to the District. There were 22 deaths in St. John's Hospital, 13 being of residents. There were 16 deaths in the Lower Sydenham Home for Sick Children, of which 13 were of residents in the District. There was 1 death in the North Surrey District Schools, and 1 death in the Watermans' Asylum, Penge. The were 184 deaths in the Park Hospital, Lewisham, 23 being of residents in the District and 161 outsiders. The deaths of 85 residents in the District were registered as having occurred in various hospitals, asylums, &c., outside the District. Of these 54 belonged to Lewisham. 17 „ to Sydenham. 12 „ to Penge. 2 „ to Lee. 76 Death rate for 1898 14.0 per 1000, as compared with 12.2 per 1000 in 1897. The death rate for England and Wales in 1898 was 17.3 per 1,000, which is lower than the rate in any previous year, except 1894, 1896, and 1897, and shows a decrease of 0.8 per 1,000 on the average of the ten years, 1888-1897. Zymotic Disease. The number of deaths from the 7 principal Zymotic Diseases was 302, as compared with 218 in the previous year. Scarlet Fever 9 deaths, as compared with 9 deaths in 1897. Diphtheria 29 „ „ 43 „ Small-pox 1 ,, „ 0 „ Typhoid 6 „ „ 10 „ Measles 44 „ „ 21 „ Whooping Cough 35 „ „ 29 „ Diarrhœa 178 „ „ 106 „ Scarlet Fever. There were 224 notifications of this disease received during 1898, as compared with 355 notifications in 1897. 70 of these cases were removed to hospital. The cases were distributed as follows:— Lewisham 96 notifications. Sydenham 77 „ Penge 18 ,, Blackheath18 „ Park Hospital (nurses or wardmaids) 5 „ North Surrey District Schools 6 „ Lewisham Infirmary 14 „ Diphtheria. There wore 313 notifications of this disease, in 1898, with 29 deaths, as compared with 240 notifications and 43 deaths in 1897. The cases were distributed as follows:— Lewisham, 203; Sydenham, 53; Penge, 25; Blackheath, 3; Park Hospital (nurses or wardmaids), 12; All Saints' Orphanage, 1; North Surrey District Schools, 4; Lewisham Infirmary, 12. 122 of these cases were removed to hospital, as against 58 cases removed in the previous year. It will be seen from these figures that, although there were 73 more cases notified than in the previous year, there were 14 fewer deaths, and also that the number of cases removed to hospital was more than double the number so removed in the previous year. Parents are gradually beginning to see the advantage of having their children nursed in hospital in serious cases of diphtheria, and comparatively seldom object to their removal. Medical men also are now in a better position as regards the early use of antitoxin. It can be obtained at once at the Offices of the Board. I feel sure that the early use of antitoxin, and the removal of patients to hospital, explains the much-lessened mortality from this disease during the last year. Typhoid Fever. There were 51 notifications of this disease, with G deaths, as compared with 62 notifications and 10 deaths, in 1897. The cases were distributed as follows:— Lewisham 21 notifications. Sydenham 20 „ Penge 7 „ Blackheath 1 „ Park Hospital 1 „ St. John's Hospital 1 „ Eleven of these cases were removed to hospital. Small Pox. There was one notification of this disease and one death 78 during 1898. This is the first case which has occurred in the District since 1895. The case was one of a child a few months' old. It was the child of a member of Wolfe's Travelling Circus, and arrived in Penge on the night of December 22nd, 1898. No Doctor saw the child alive in England, as it died during the night. The Medical Man who saw the dead body certified it as having died from small pox and I was immediately communicated with. The body was at once removed to the Mortuary where I saw it. It was a case of confluent small pox. I immediately had the three people who were with the child removed in an ambulance to Hither-green Hospital. The clothes they were wearing were burned, and they were thoroughly disinfected and isolated for 18 days, and were all re-vaccinated. The bedding of the room they had occupied was burned, and the room disinfected and whitewashed, walls stripped, &c. I saw Mr. Wolfe, the proprietor of the Circus, and he agreed to have all the troop vaccinated except those who had very well marked scars of vaccination, and this was done. At first sight it looked as if there was certain to be an outbreak as the baby had been in contact with so many members of the troop, but fortunately no fresh case appeared. The baby had travelled with the troop from Antwerp. It had been seen by a Medical Man there who said it was suffering from measles but might safely travel Probably, at the time he saw the child, the rash had not properly come out, but at the time of its death it was very fully developed. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. The total number of deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs was 224, as compared with 183 in the previous year. Of this number 36 deaths were attributed directly to Influenza, as compared with 12 deaths in 1897, 11 deaths in 1896, and 61 deaths in 1895. 79 Inquests. Coroner's inquests were held in 82 cases of death. The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural causes 35 Violent deaths 47 27 deaths were returned as "Not Certified." Meteorology. During the year 1898 the mean temperature of the air at Greenwich was 51.3. The lowest temperature, 26.1, occurred in February, and the highest, 92.1, in September. Rain fell on 142 days; but the rainfall was only 18.85 inches, much below the average for the last 83 years, which is 24.92 inches. I am, Gentlemen, Faithfully yours, S. BLAKE JOLLY, Medical Officer of Health to the Lewisham District. 80 TABLE I.—Shewing the Population, Inhabited Houses, Marriages, Births, and Deaths, for the Year 1898 and 10 years preceding.

The Board of Works for the Lewisham District. SURVEYOR'S REPORT On Work executed from Lady-day, 1898, to Lady-day, 1899. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting this, my Thirtieth Annual Report. It embraces the works carried out during the last financial year, and the general business of my department. HIGHWAYS. The Material used for the maintenance and repair of the public roads and footpaths in the District during the year was as follows:— Division. Guernsey Granite. Port Philip. j Quartzite. Dug Flints. Gravel. Total. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Blackheath, Lewisham, Brookley, &c. 2493 796 825 1595 479 6188 There were not any severe or continued frosts during the year, but the many short frosts were very destructive to the roads. The rainfall was not above the average. The roads maintained by Quartzite have worn very well. This stone was used as an experiment, three years ago, on roads where there is not a great traffic. The roads, generally speaking, in spite of the greatly increasing traffic, are in good order. Seventy-two loads of gravel, or grit, were spread on the slippery roads and footpaths during the frosty weather. ROAD WATERING. This work was done by men employed by, and horses belonging to, the Board, assisted by men and horses supplied by 102 Mr. Wm. Joy, at 8s. per horse, harness and man per day in Lewisham and Brockley, and at 8s. 6d. per horse, harness and man per day at Blackheath. The whole of the carts and vans were provided by the Board. The length of the roads watered is as follows:— Miles. Yards. Water supplied by the Kent Water Company 33 0 „ „ „ Southwark & Vauxhall Water Co. 1143 „ „ „ Lambeth Water Company 1 890 Total 35 273 STREET LIGHTING. The South Metropolitan Gas Company light, extinguish, clean, paint, maintain and supply gas to 935 ordinary Lamps, 30 special Lamps, and one at the "White Hart" Urinal; onehalf of the cost of this lamp being paid by Messrs. Whitbread, the brewers. In addition to the above public Lamps, the South Metropolitan Gas Company supply gas to, and maintain, &c., 63 Incandescent Lamps of an improved pattern. Gas is supplied to 37 ordinary Lamps by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. The charge made by the former Company for the first three quarters of the year was £3 3s 9d. per lamp per annum, but from Christmas it was reduced to £3 2s. Od. The Crystal Palace District Gas Company make a charge of £3 2s. 10d. per lamp per annum. These prices include the supply of gas, lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, painting and maintenance of lantern fittings and columns. It was found necessary, in consequence of making up New Streets, and for the purpose of improving the lighting in the District, to have 54 lamps removed. Forty-three ordinary Lamps have been discontinued, and larger lanterns, with increased burners, were substituted. The following new Lamps were erected:— No. of Lamp*. Arabin Road 1 Arngask Road 2 Beecroft Road 1 Bradgate Road 1 Church Meadow Footpath 1 103 No. of Lamps.

The dust and house refuse in Blackheath, Lewisham, Brockley, &c., was collected by men and boys in the employ of the Board, the horses being supplied by Messrs. Thos. Tilling, Ltd., of High Street, Peckham, at 4s. 5d. per horse and harness per day. 8,679 loads of dust were collected during the year, and how the same was disposed of is shewn in the following table:— Division. To whom Supplied. On what Terms Supplied. Blackheath, Lewisham, Brockley, &c. Messrs. J. Heath and Sons Mr. G. Clark Molesworth-street Dust Destructor The Board paid 6d. per load for the shoot. Free shoot. Free ditto. There were seven loads of trade refuse removed and disposed of daring the year. Most of the tradesmen get rid of their own refuse. 105 NEW WORKS. The following table shews where new kerb and channel were laid during the year:— Locality. Description of Work. Porson Street . 1,063 ft. run of 12in. by 8in. granite kerb. 1,171 ft. run of 3 course granite channel. Shrubbery Road 876 ft. run of 12in. by 8in. granite kerb. 937 ft. run of 3 course granite channel. Mill Road 570 ft. run of 12in. by 8in. granite kerb. 731 ft. run of 3 course granite channel. Altogether 2,509 feet run of 12in. by 8in. kerb, and 2,839 feet run of three course 5in. by 6in. channel. New crossings were laid as follows: Rushey-green across the entrance to Davenport-road, and High-street across the entrance to Whitburn-street—being 58 yards super of granite crossings, and also 43 superficial yards of granite pitching were laid in Comerford Road at the juuiction of Brockley-road. TAR-PAVEMENT AND ROCK ASPHALTE. During the year 1,983 superficial yards of Tar Paving were taken up and relaid, and 20,419 superficial yards were painted with hot tar and sand. The footpath (2,512 superficial yards) on the north side of the Dover Road, from the top of Blackheath Hill to the Greenwich Boundary, was picked up, re-gravelled, rolled with a heavy roller, painted twice with hot tar, and coated with sand. The following table gives the Rock Asphalte Paths repaired and relaid during the year. Altogether 2,306 superficial yards of Rock Asphalte were laid:— 106 Name of Road. Quantity laid. Super, yards.

HOUSES SANCTIONED TO BE BUILT, DRAINED, &c. The following table shews the number of houses sanctioned to be built, drained, &c. Locality. No. of Houses sane- ! tinned to be Built and Drained. No. of Houses, &c., sanctioned to be Drained. No. of Additions to Buildings sanctioned. No. of Dwelling Houses and Public Buildings, Sc., completed within the year. No. of Frontage Drains laid. No. of Gullies constructed in Public Roads. No. of Manholes built on existing Sewers. No. of Flushing Tanks constructed on existing Sewers. No. of Ventilators erected on existing Sewers. Blackheath, Lewisham, Brockley, &e. 1562 252 45 1397 105 9 1 1 1 One flushing tank was constructed on the Bromley Road Sewer, also a manhole on the Loainpit Hill Sewer, and a ventilator on the old Sewer in the valley near Blackheath Railway Station. The following disinfectants were used for the purpose of disinfecting sewers, drains, gullies, cesspools and dust bins, and for distribution to poor people. Permanganate of Potash 10 cwt. Sanitas Powder 56 tons. Jeyes'Fluid 1,110 gallons. Lawes'Fluid 240 gallons. Sanitas (crude) Fluid 216 gallons. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE LAID. Name of Road. length in feet. Size. Material. Remarks. Bromley Road Improvement near St. Lawrence Church. 215 24-in. Stoneware Laid in ditch. 109 Two manholes were constructed on the surface water drains in Bromley Road and High Street, Lewisham. A great number of old drains were examined and stoppages removed ; in many cases the drains being relaid. A very large amount of labour was expended on this particular work. From the table at page 8 in this Report it will be seen that in Blackheath, Lewisham, Brockley, &c., 1,397 dwelling houses and public buildings were completed during the year, and 105 new frontage drains laid. The number of old drains relaid—a considerable item—is not included in this table. The whole of the new drains, and also the old—where relaid—were tested with water before the trenches were filled in with earth. There were 2,587 separate testings. This represents a very large amount of work. The cesspools at Brockley, and at the Woodlands, Hither Green Lane, were regularly emptied, the work being done by the Board and at the public cost. I am pleased to say that the cesspools in Southend village were destroyed and the houses now drain into the new sewer. The connection of the London County Council's relief sewer was made during the year with the Board's new Sewer from Bell Green to Clarina Road, Penge, and this line is now available for the relief of storm water during heavy rainfalls. The Staustead Road and Waldram Road Sewer was completed during the year. This sewer is 2,075 ft. in length and constructed with brick and concrete, being 4-ft. 0-in. by 3-ft. 8-in. and 3-ft 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in.; the contract sum being £3,231. The Brockley Valley Sewer was commenced soon after Christmas. Mr. John Neave is doin the work under contract, the contract sum being £3,948. The owners of land are contributing to the cost. The sewer is 3,674 feet long, and constructed with brick and Portland cement concrete, and the size of the sewer is 3-ft. 9-in. by 2-ft. 6-in. The work is proceeding satisfactorily, and I expect will be completed before the contract time. The first portion of the sewer was constructed in rather wet ground, and in the upper portion hard beds of cockle shell were found. I am anxious to see this sewer extended to Brockley Rise, and thus have an available sewer to drain the houses which at present drain into cesspools in that neighbourhood. 110 The table at page 7 gives the sewers constructed in the Lewisham District during the year. They are an unusual number. Two very useful sewers were constructed out of Hither Green Lane, viz., Benin Street and Woodlands Street. I hope to see the houses at the Woodlands, Hither Green, drained by means of these sewers, and the cesspools, which have given so much trouble, abolished. It will be seen that the cesspools in the District are steadily disappearing, and that in all probability it will not be long before they will be a thing of the past. OFFICES. A great deal of time was devoted to the consideration of the extension of the Lewisham Town Hall and I submitted many plans. The following is a short description of the increased accommodation:— First floor. Board Room extended 19ft. 6in., and will be 66ft. 3in. by 30ft. The Public Gallery to be placed at the end, as at present, with an entrance direct from the outside of the building. Committee room No. 1. This room is now placed between the Chairman's room and Committee room No. 2; Committee room No. 2 remains as at present; Committee room No. 3—a new room 35ft. by 21ft.—placed over the Guardians' Offices and entered from an ante room. The Chairman's room adjoins the above. Members' room and Library.—It is proposed to use the present Committee room, No. 1, for this. Deputation room. This is at the top of main staircase. Members' Cloak room and Lavatory are at the top of main staircase separate and distinct. Burial Board, Charity Trustees, Baths Committee, and Library Committee. These four rooms are placed on this floor in the block fronting Springfield Park Crescent. A small Office Lavatory is provided adjoining the above. Ground Floor. Clerks' Department. The present General Offices to be altered 111 to provide office for the Clerk of the Board; office for the Secretary of the Board ; Waiting Room. General Office. This is placed as near as possible to main entrance. Surveyors' Department. The offices now used by the Parochial Guardians to be added to the Surveyor's Department. Office for the Surveyor to the Board; office for the Assistant Surveyor; office for Clerks. Contractors' Room and Waiting Lobby. In extending the Board Room a Drawing Office is provided beneath. Sanitary Department. These offices are provided for in the block facing Springfield Park Crescent, and comprise offices for Medical Officer of Health and Sanitary Inspectors. Vestry Clerks' Office adjoins the above. Parochial Guardians' Offices. Provision is made, in extending the present building on the west side, for these offices, with a new entrance from the main road:—Office for the Clerk to the Guardians; General Office; Rate Collectors' Office; Office Lavatories, &c. Main Staircase. The present staircase to be taken down and a new one erected to admit of greater headway in extending the Corridor through to the new entrance from Springfield Park Crescent. Basement. Muniment room; three Strong rooms; Store room; Heating Chamber; Coals, &c. These are placed under the General Offices, &c. A Strong room and Store room are provided under the Guardians' Offices for their use. Second Floor. Housekeeper or Caretaker. Three bedrooms, with a kitchen and scullery for Housekeeper on this floor; also sitting room. A separate staircase is provided for the Housekeeper. The rooms in the roof of the building facing the main road will be available for general storage purposes. 112 The area of the present buildings is about 458 superficial yards, and of the building as enlarged 1,131 superficial yards. CORONER'S COURT AND MORTUARIES, ladywell road. These buildings were completed during the year by Messrs. J. & C. Bowyer. In my last report I described the accommodation provided. The first inquest took place on the 29th March, 1899. The buildings appear to have given general satisfaction to all who have seen or used them. The Contract sum was £4,395. DEPOTS, SHOOTS, &c. There is still a great difficulty in obtaining shoots for road detritus or slop. The following table will give the shoots at present used and the price paid for the shoot:— Locality of Shoot. Price Paid, &c. Berlin Road (Mr. Watt) Is. per load. Berlin Road (Mr. Laird) Is. per load. Brockley Road (Mr. Busk) 6d. per load. Blagden Street (Mr. Murrell) Is. per load. George Lane (Mr. Pickernell) Is. per load. Blackheath Free. Sangley Farm Free. Ladywell Road (Mr. Graham) Is. per load. Molesworth Street Depdt Free. During the year 17,731 loads of slop were shot at the various shoots. The summer was very dry. There was little or no snow in the winter. At no distant period the question of slop shoots will have to be seriously considered. On account of the dust and house refuse being so advantageously disposed of at the brickfields, the Dust Destructor has not been regularly worked during the year. During the present year I hope to submit a plan for additional cart sheds at the Molesworth Street Dep6t. They are much needed. A small piece of ground has been hired for use as a Depot adjoining Sion House, No. 234, High Street, Lewisham, which will be very useful. 113 RAILWAY AND OTHER SCHEMES. A Parliamentary deposit was made by the South Eastern Railway for widening their main line and certain loop, or branch, lines. I made a full report on the scheme and the matter is now under negotiation. The following bridges are interfered with Loampit-vale; Bertrand-street; River Ravensbourne; High-street, Lewisham, near Morley-road; Top of Conrt-hill-road near "Queen's Arms"; Footpath bridge near Dermody-road; Ennersdale-road; Ladywell bridge; Catford bridge. I am afraid this scheme will delay the widening of Catford and Ladywell bridges. The County of London (South East) Electric Lighting had a scheme before Parliament affecting the District which was withdrawn, and the Lewisham District Board are applying for a provisional order to light a portion of the District. IMPROVEMENTS, FRONTAGE LINES, BUILDING ACT CASES, &c. A very great improvement was made at the junction of Highstreet with Ladywell-road by widening the old road in one place nearly ten feet, the old square corner being done away with and a bold rounded corner substituted, thereby making a far better entrance to Ladywell-road than existed previously. An improvement was also carried out at the corner of Berlinroad and Bromley-road by setting the old gravel path back about six feet and relaying a short length of old kerb and channel. Although the road is made wider, the footpath is not narrower than it was formerly because land has been thrown in the path in front of the new houses recently erected. Another improvement was made in Bromley-road extending along the front of the Vicarage and St. Laurence Church to the corner of Catford-road. A portion of the roadway ditch was filled in and piped with 24-in. glazed stoneware socket pipes, the ground was thus thrown into the footpath and the roadway was widened to a corresponding extent. The corner was rounded off, and the junction of Catford-road with Bromley-road considerably improved. 114 An improvement was commenced in Brockley-grove along the frontage of the Deptford Cemetery by widening the old roadway for about 746 feet in length to a width of 40 feet. When the Earl St. German sold the land to the Deptford Cemetery Company it was on the understanding that the road was widened to 40 feet. The Cemetery Company are going to erect a light iron railing on a dwarf wall. The Bridge House Estate are also giving up land in Brockley-grove to make a 50 feet roadway from Algernon-road to near the boundary of their estate, and when this is done Brockley-grove will be a fine wide road. A road improvement was also carried out near the upper mill, Bromley-road, by filling in the washway and effecting an exchange of land by a give and take line, and widening the roadway. All these improvements were carried out free of cost to the Board, so far as the requisite land was concerned. In paving and forming Hither-green-lane an arrangement was made with A. Cameron Corbett, Esq., M.P., to give up land to make a 50-ft. road. It is of the greatest importance in a growing district like Lewisham to secure wide roads for the main thoroughfares, and I think the Board have been very successful in this particular during the year. Plans and detail drawings were prepared of an Underground Convenience to be constructed near the Obelisk, Lewisham Bridge. The drawings are approved by the Board, and the accommodation provided is as follows: Ladies lavatory and w.c.'s; Gentlemen's lavatory, w.c.'s, and urinals. Rooms are provided for Caretakers. Estimated cost, £1,800. The specification has been prepared and the quantities are now being taken out. I append to this report a list of the applications received from the London County Council relative to lines of frontage and cases that come under the Metropolis Building Act. An inspection will show how each case has been dealt with, and I had, in many cases to attend at the London County Council. Several trenches were opened by the Blackheath and Green- 115 wich Electric Light Company for the purpose of laying their cables and wires. 1,121 openings were made in the roads and footways by the Gas and Water Companies for the purpose of laying new services and repairing and renewing old services. Many new mains were laid and' old ones repaired. There were twelve Hoard Licenses granted to Builders for occupying roads and footways in order to carry out building operations. I attach to this report a list of the Automatic Flushing Tanks in use, together with the size of the Syphons, &c.; also a list of streets and roads, giving the mileage maintained by the Board, together with a list of New Streets sanctioned by the London County Council during the year. I prepared plans and sections for widening the High Street, Lewisham, between Albion-road and the turning to Lee Bridge. The Works and General Purposes Committee had under consideration the substitution of Artificial Stone Flagging for Tar Pavement, I made a report on the subject, dated the 18th Nov,, 1898, in which I pointed out that it would be, by reason of the increasing traffic, ultimate economy to use Artificial Stone Flagging in place of Tar Paving for the Footways, and I have no doubt a considerable quantity of Artificial Stone will be used in the future for the footpaths of the Highways and New Streets. I am making some flags as an experiment. I also made a report on the Public Rights of Way in the District, and a number of notice, or direction boards, having reierence to them, were erected by order of the Board. A great many plans were made, and 1 was engaged in getting up evidence in regard to the Cator Estate Claim for damage, &c., done by reason of the construction of the new Sewer from Bell Green to Clarina-road, Pcnge. The case went to arbitration and I am pleased to say the Cator Estate were unable to uphold the claim, and the arbitrator decided in favour of the Board. 116 The passages between Thornford-road and Harvard-road, and Harvard-road and Fordyce-road, were laid with Tar Paving. There were 516 plans and tracings made during the year ; many letters and reports written, also specifications and estimates prepared. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., &c., Surveyor to the Boarc.

To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Lewisham District. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting my second annual report for the above portion of the Lewisham District. HIGHWAYS. The quantity of material used in the repair of the roads and footpaths under the control of the Board was as follows:— Division. Broken Granite. Kentish Ragstone. Picked Flints. Dug Flints. Gravel. Granite Chippings. Total. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Cubic yds. Sydenham and Forest-hill 2537 299 ... 1648 2047 ... 6531 Hamlet of Penge 911 149 1217 ... 900 64 3183 Total 3448 448 1217 1648 2947 64 9714 A great deal of attention has been given to the repair of the roads, and the use of slop (or road sweepings) for binding in granite has been entirely discontinued, fine Croydon gravel having been mostly used; this, although, of course, adding to the first cost of laying a broken granite road, is undoubtedly economical in the end, as the roads not only wear better but they are cleaner, and there is not the same amount of slop to be removed after every rain. A portion of Anerley-road was laid with granite broken to a smaller size, and granite chippings were used to bind it in ; this has made a very good road but the expense of rolling was very considerable. I am proposing to try other materials for 122 binding purposes during t,he ensuing year. Kentish Rag makes a very good road where there are steep hills, but being of a somewhat greasy nature, it is better mixed with some other stone— Anerley-hill has been made up with it, mixed with granite, and Belvedere-road with Kent Rag and Flints mixed. Roth roads arc now in good condition and there are no loose stones about. A greater quantity of broken granite is required in Sydenham and Forest hill. TAR PAVEMENT. A great many of the footpaths were repaired with tar pavement in different ways, amounting to a total of 138,441 superficial yards, or over 28½ acres. by tar painting the footpaths before they are worn too far they are preserved for a considerable time, but it makes an immense area to be dealt with every year. The following table gives the particulars of the work done: Division. New tar pavement. Broken-up and re-laid. Covered thinly with new tar pavement. Tar painted.

ARTIFICIAL STONE PAVEMENT. By direction of the Penge Committee I had a small quantity of Artificial Stone Pavement made, which has been laid (since the 25th March) in Anerley-road, opposite the Vestry Hall. To make a good artificial stone it is essential that the wearing surface should be composed of a hard aggregate, mixed with about half its quantity of high class Portland cement. The majority of artificial stone makers have used crushed granite and Portland cemcnt, in the proportion of 2 to 1; but as both these materials are very expensive, it occurred to me that the stones might be made in two layers, the top made of these materials and the 123 bottom of fine ballast and cement, in the proportion of 4 to 1 This very materially reduces the cost of manufacture without lessening the life of the stone, as by the time the top is worn off any stone it is hollow, and only fit for breaking up. The top layer is put into the moulds while the bottom layer is still wet, and perfect adhesion takes place. 1 also find that the stone cuts well. I hope to make a considerable quantity during the ensuing year. Artificial Stone Slabs made by Messrs. Wilkinson & Co., of Newcastle, were laid in London-road (185 superficial yards), and in Perry-vale, The Parade (501 superficial yards). These slabs are made of crushed ballast and cement. ASPHALTE. 1,549 square yards of Asphalte were taken up and relaid ; and 179 square yards of new Asphalte were laid. HORSE HIRE. Horses were hired, under contract, from Mr. Stimpson for watering and cartage, and Messrs. Thos. Tilling & Co., for dust collecting, in Sydenham and Forest-hill; and from Mr. Winnifrith, for all purposes, in the Hamlet of Penge. The prices per frith, for all purposes, in the Hamlet of Penge. The prices per day were as follows:— Division. Cartage. Horse-hire, harness and driver. Watering. Horse, harness and driver. Dust Collect'n. Horse, and harness. Dust Collect''n.

The whole of the lamps in the Sydenham and Forest-hill and Penge divisions of the District are supplied with gas by the Crystal Palaee District Gas Company at a fixed price of £3 2s. l0d. per lamp per annum, which includes lighting, extinguishing, cleaniug, painting, and repairing for the ordinary 5-feet per hour burner, less 5 per cent, discount for cash. The Special lamps vary in price according to the size of the burners In Sydenham and Forest hill there are 938 ordinary lamps, and 26 Special lamps; 23 lamps were removed to improve the lighting, or for New Street or Paving purposes. In the Hamlet of Penge there are 377 ordinary lamps, and 26 Special lamps 5 lamps were removed. The lanterns of the public lamps throughout the District are of a very old and imperfect pattern which absorbs a great deal of the light; they are without reflectors, and have heavy frames in iron cradles which throw dark shadows. I had several interviews 125 with the Engineer of the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, and ultimately arranged with him that as the old lanterns were worn out they should be replaced with a greatly improved lantern of modern pattern, fitted with a reflector— the increased price, viz., 13s. 9d. per lantern, being defrayed by the Gas Company and the Board, the former paying 8s. 7d., and the latter 5s. 2d. I consider this is a very good arrangement because we are not only benefitting at present by the greater light obtained from these lamps, but the improved lanterns can be used in the future for improved, or increased power, burners if required. The following new lamps were erected in Sydenham and Forest Hill. Number.

The Sewers throughout this division were carefully flushed and cleansed, the flushing being carried out by means of the automatic flushing tanks supplemented by carts I think that the majority of the inhabitants are not aware of the existence of these tanks, and frequently fancy that the sewers are being neglected because they do not see the flushing cart at work. The Sewers in Fenge are now cleansed by a separate gang of sewer men ; a great deal of delay was formerly caused by the whole of the sewer-men being worked from Catford. The present system is a great improvement. The Sewer in Wynell-road was found to be in a very bad condition, the whole of the pipes were cracked, and some had fallen in; it was decided to relay it in new 12-inch pipes, and the work has been commenced. A considerable amount of time has been expended in examining old Sewers and removing stoppages, also in testing new drains. During the year 1162 wrere water tested. The following table shows the number of houses sanctioned to be built, drained, &c., and number of gulleys and ventilators constructed:— Division. No. of houses sanctioned to be built and drained. No. of houses sanctioned to be drained. No. of additions to buildings sanctioned. No. of dwelling houses public buildings, &c., completed during year. No. of frontage drains laid.

A very great improvement was carried out at the corner of Kirkdale and Jews Walk; the Sydenham Public Hall Company gave up a piece of land, 180 super yards in extent, to the Board for a consideration of £50. The kerb and channel have been set back, widening the roadway by about .34 feet at the point; the asphalte has been relaid, and the large lamp which formerly stood at the corner of Sydenham Park has been moved to a refuge in the centre of the road. A portion of the land is reserved for the erection of one of the fonntains to commemorate her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee. An Improvement was also proposed at the corner of Houstonroad and Perry-hill. The negotiations in connection with it are practically completed, but the work has not been commenced ; it is intended to make Houston-road 40 feet wide, at present it is only 10 feet 8 inches at the narrowest part. This will be an immense improvement, as at present it is dangerous to traffic. In building a new house, No. 345, Stanstead-road, a part of the front was given up to widen the footpath, and the piece of ground fenced in by the Board, at the corner of St. Dunstan's College grounds, was thrown open in connection with this; it would be a good thing if the fence of the adjoining house were set back. In Dartmouth-road Mr. Christmas set back his buildings to widen the road; these will be completed next year, when I hep1 to see the road widened. A great improvement will be effected. It is also proposed to widen Newlands-park at theSydenhamroad end. A very large brick pier, which stood on the footpath at the corner of Seymour-villas and Ancrley-road, was removed, and the ground on which it stood was thrown into the footpath. RECREATION GROUNDS. New wrought iron gates and brick piers were built at the entrances to the Sydenham Recreation Ground from Silverdalc and Recreation-road. The old wooden gates were worn out and unsightly. The Committee-room attached to the Lodge was extended 8 feet. This was a great improvement, as the old room was very small. 131 About one-half of the Tar-pavement at the Penge Recreation Ground was retopped with fine tar-pavement. It is proposed to do the other half this year. DEPOTS. A small office was built in the Penge yard for the use of the Inspector of Works there and myself; it is a very great convenience. The tar-pavement shed was moved from the yard at the back of the Gas Works, Lower Sydenham, into the Home Park Dep6t. A roadway was formed about halfway up this ground. TELEPHONES. Telephonic communication was set up between the Offices at the Town Hall and the yards at Waldram-road, Forest-hill, and Beckenham-road, Penge, as well as from the Town-hall to the National Telephone Company's system. This affords great facilities for the rapid transaction of business, and is of especial use to me in communicating quickly with Forest-hill and Penge PARLIAMENTARY AND OTHER SCHEMES. It was sought to obtain power from the .Light Railway Commissioners to construct a Light Railway from Herne-hill to Farnborough, passing through Beckenham-road, Penge, and a short part of West-hill, Sydenham. I reported on it to the Board, and it was decided to oppose the scheme, which was ultimately abandoned. Application was also made for the construction of light railways to the Crystal Palace. The only one affecting this District to any extent was one at the upper end of Anerley-hill, from the Crystal Palace-parade, down Anerley-hill and Ledrington-road, to the Low Level entrance to the Palace. The Board decided to oppose this, and it was also withdrawn. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company deposited plans for the extension of their goods yards at Foresthill and Penge The Board took no action with regard to this Bill. STEAM ROLLER. A new 15-ton Steam Road Roller was purchased for use in he Sydenham and Forest-hill Division, and the old 10-ton roller 132 was returned to Penge. The new roller was much wanted. I could find use for another roller, which it would be advantageous to purchase soon. MISCELLANEOUS. The Crystal Palace District Electric Light Company appealed to the Board of Trade against a decision of this Board that certain pipes (to carry cables) should be laid in the carriage-ways instead of the footways I attended the hearing of the appeal, with the Clerk to the Board, and the Board of Trade upheld this Board's order. Notices were fixed at each end of all the public footpaths in this division indicating that there was a public footpath, and the point to which it led. A great many tablets were fixed to public lamps showing street names. At the request of the London County Council the nearest lamp post to each fire alarm in the division was painted red, in order to show the positions of the fire alarm posts at night. The lengths of all the Streets maintained by the Board, and a list of the automatic flushing tanks are appended to this report. The London County Council sent requests for suggestions on 39 applications made to them for permission to build beyond the general line, and tor formation of New Streets; the manner in which each was dealt with is shown in a tabulated statement in the Appendix. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, ERNEST VAN PUTT EN, Assoc. Memb. List. C.E. Assistant Surveyor to the Board.
