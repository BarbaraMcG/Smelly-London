TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE LEYTON URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to submit the Annual Report for 1914 on the Public Health and Vital Statistics of the District. Dr. Taylor filled his accustomed position of Medical Officer of Health until the outbreak. of war on August 4th, and it is only from that date that I have had charge of the work in the Public Health Department. For the sake of completeness this Report refers to the whole of the year 1914. As is shown in the body of the Report, the healthiness of the District and the sanitation in general have been maintained. The Death Rate remains almost the same as that of last year; the Birth Rate continues to decline. The absence of provision for the Hospital treatment of Smallpox is a matter of grave concern; the susceptibility of the public to this disease is increasing from year to year in parallel with the exemptions from infantile vaccination, and the danger of an outbreak of the disease is correspondingly greater. Such an epidemic would be difficult to combat, and could not fail to take its toll in loss of life. I wish to express my indebtedness to all the members of the Council, and in especial to the Chairmen of the Public Health and Education Committees, for the courtesy and consideration they have extended to me. My best thanks are also due to my fellow officials for much kindness on all occasions. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED BALL. Leyton Uran District Council. ANNUAL HEALTH REPORT FOR 1914, by ALFRED BALL, M.D., D.P.H., Deputy Medical Officer of Health. The general characteristics of the District and of its inhabitants having been outlined in previous reports, it is unnecessary to repeat them here. ASSESSABLE AND RATEABLE VALUE. The present assessable value for general district purposes is £509,474 7s., and a rate of 1d. in the £1 produces £1,980. For poor rate purposes the rateable value is £542,120 10s., and 1d. rate produces £2,097. AREA, INHABITED HOUSES, POPULATION. The district has a total area of 2,594 acres ; at the end of June it contained 23,602 houses,of which number 361 were uninhabited. The census population divided among the inhabited houses gave an average of 5.63 persons per house. On this basis our population at the middle of the year totals 130,847 persons. The Registrar-General's estimate for the middle of the year 1914 is 131,224. As pointed out in former reports, the Registrar-General has previously estimated the population on the assumption that the rate of increase during 1901 - 1911 has continued; but in view of the fall in the rate of natural increase since 1911, and an increase in the loss by migration, a new estimate has been made for the middle of 1914 based upon the returns of births, deaths and migration. 8 The number of new houses erected in the district during the year 1911 was only 79. But as the number of houses occupied by two or more families is steadily increasing, the average number of persons per house will be found to be greater at the next Census than at the last. The demand for houses in Leyton may be gauged from the return of uninhabited houses; these, which in 1912 numbered 921, have now dropped to 361. The above facts indicate some of the difficulties encountered in attempting to arrive at an estimate of the population, the only remedy for which is a more frequent Census. For the purposes of this year's report 1 am taking 130,847 to be our population, which closely approximates to the figure arrived at by the Registrar-General by his revised method of estimating population. The following table shows the constitution of the various wards into which Leyton is divided :— Ward. Area in Acres. Number of Houses. Peesons per Acre. Number of inhabited Houses. Population. Leyton 432 1803 23.0 1768 9954 Lea Bridge 521 3306 35.3 3265 18382 Forest 599 3303 30.4 3237 18224 Central 233 4256 101.5 4201 23652 Leytonstone 326 2961 50.0 2895 16299 Harrow Green 139 1941 77.6 1915 10781 Grove Green 121 1860 85.0 1827 10286 Cann Hall 135 2517 104.3 2500 14075 Wanstead Slip 88 1655 104.5 1633 9194 2594 23602 50-4 23241 130847 BIRTHS. During the year 2,800 births were registered, giving a birthrate of 21.4 per 1,000 of the population. Of these, 1,421 were males and 1,379 females. 9 Births.—1914. Year 1914.

Our birth-rate for 1907 was 26.6 per 1,000 of population. „ „ 1908 ,, 25.3 ,, „ „ „ 1909 ,, 24.6 ,, „ 1910 „ 24.4 1911 „ 23.5 1912 „ 22.1 1913 „ 22.4 „ „ 1914 ,, 21.4 ,, ,, The birth-rate, which it will thus be seen has been diminishing year by year, is 1.0 per 1,000 of the population lower than last year. The birth-rate throughout England and Wales in 1914 is 0'3 per 1,000 below the rate in 1913, and is lower than the rate in any other year on record. The marriage-rate in England and Wales in 1914 was 15.9 persons married per 1,000 of the population. This is an increase of 0'6 per 1,000 upon the average in the ten years 1904-1913. The number of illegitimate births was 63, of which 31 were males and 32 females. Our illegitimate birth-rate is therefore 48 per 1,000 of the population. DEATHS. As in last year's returns, the transferable deaths, that is those of residents of Leyton who have died in other districts, are included in the present report. The inhabitants of Leyton who died during the year 1914 numbered 1,36.3. Of these 679 were males and 684 females. Our death-rate is thus, approximately, 10.4 per 1,000 of the population. In 1913 the death-rate was 10.3 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate tor England and Wales in 1914 was 14.0; for the 97 Great Towns, 14.7; and for London, 14'4. 11 The table below shows the number of deaths which occurred from certain specified causes for the past five years :— 1910 1911 1912 1913 1914 Diarrhœal Diseases 21 126 31 58 55 Measles 16 76 12 31 15 Pneumonia (all forms) 67 101 111 117 93 Tubercular Diseases 133 171 159 134 141 Cancer 87 99 93 97 128 Enteric Fever 2 5 4 0 5 Whooping Cough 16 20 38 18 21 Diphtheria 22 14 22 11 29 Scarlet Fever 16 7 4 0 3 Influenza 15 11 9 9 15 Puerperal Fever 3 2 5 4 3 Premature Births, Congenital Debility, &c. 116 124 100 108 92 Nephritis and Bright's Disease 40 43 53 48 49 Suicides 7 3 4 12 9 ZYMOTIC DEATH-RATE. The deaths which occurred during the year from the seven principal Zymotic diseases were distributed among those diseases as follows:—Measles, 15; Scarlet Fever, 3; Diphtheria, 29; Whooping Cough, 21; Enteric Fever, 5; Diarrhœa and Enteritis, 55. In 1906 our Zymotic death-rate was 2.3 per 1,000 of the population. „ 1907„ „ „1.7 „ „ ,, 1908 ,, ,, ,, ,, .9 ,, „ ,, 1909 ,, „ „ ,, .97 ,, ,, ,, 1910 ,, ,, „ „ .65 ,, „ ,,1911,, ,, ,, ,, 1.84 ,, ,, ,, 1912 ,, „ „ „ .83 ,, „ ,,1913,, ,, ,, ,, .8 ,, ,, ,, 1914 ,, ,, ,, „ .97 ,, „ The Zymotic death-rate for London was 1.65. 12 The Registrar-General has ceased to calculate the Zymotic death-rate as a whole, but he gives the rate for each disease separately. I am therefore unable to compare our Zymotic deathrate with those of England and Wales, and the 97 Great Towns. INFANTILE DEATH-RATE. The infantile mortality rate, i.e., the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 78.2. In 1906 our infantile mortality rate was 114.5 „ 1907 „ „ „ 86.5 ,, 1908 „ „ „ „ 78.8 „ 1909 „ „ „ „ 81.9 „ 1910 „ „ „ „ 63.4 „ 1911 „ „ „ „ 111.6 „ 1912 „ „ „ „ 79.7 „ 1913 ,, ,, ,, ,, 83.3 „ 1914 ,, ,, ,, ,, 78.2 On reference to the tables it will be seen that of the 219 deaths which occurred in infants under one year of age, 109, or 49.8 per cent., were due to ante-natal causes. The infantile mortality rate for England and Wales was 105 ,, ,, ,, ,, London 104 ,, ,, ,, the 97 Great Towns ,, 114 There were 5 deaths of illegitimate children under 1 year of age, viz. : 2 males and 3 females. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. This Act is not in force in this district. In September a circular letter from the Local Government Board was considered emphasising the value of systematic visitation of the homes of infants and intimating the desirability of making use of the powers given by the above Act. However, no steps were taken, as the Council considered the adoption of the Act unnecessary. 13 No action has been taken in Leyton by any local Association in connection with the Notification of Births Act. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE. A circular letter from the Local Government Board intimating that an estimate had been laid before Parliament for a grant to be distributed by the Board in aid of the expenditure of local authorities and voluntary agencies in respect of institutions or other provisions for maternity and child welfare was considered, but action was adjourned for the present. OUTBREAKS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. No case of Plague, Cholera, or Smallpox, or any serious outbreak of epidemic disease has occurred in the district. SMALL-POX. Since March 5th, 1913, Leyton has been in the indefensible position of being without hospital accommodation for cases of Small-pox. Two proposals lor dealing with cases have occupied the attention of the Council, one being that we should again join West Ham, as in the days before our agreement with the Metropolitan Asylums Board; and the other that we should become a constitutent authority of the South Mimms Hospital. Both schemes however have been rejected, and in the meantime the public will be exposed to the risk of an epidemic of Small-pox should any cases be imported into the district. Such an outbreak, even if it did not actually cause loss of life, would certainly be costly and troublesome to extinguish. May I again point out that there is urgent need of hospital provision for cases of Small-pox ; to wait for the occurrence of an outbreak before filling this need is to risk disaster. 14 VACCINATION RETURNS. The following are the details received from the Vaccination Officer as to infant Vaccination for the past 6½ years :— Number of Births. Vaccinated. Certificates of Insusceptibility. Exemptions. Died Unvaccinated under 1 year. 1908 3071 1756 12 487 199 1909 2979 1396 12 556 173 1910 3011 1241 10 730 140 1911 2931 976 11 658 180 1912 2797 1156 5 1069 154 1913 2925 1152 10 1192 169 1914 1378 520 8 617 67 'January 1st to June 30th. ENTERIC FEVER. 12 cases were notified, of which number 4 were subsequently proved to have been errors in diagnosis. 4 deaths occurred ; in addition, 1 death occurred in Berkshire Asylum, and this being a former resident in the district was accredited to Leyton. Our death-rate from Enteric Fever was .01 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .05; and of the 97 Great Towns, 04; and of London, '03. Every case was visited, usually by the Medical Officer of Health, and in addition to giving suitable advice, etc., endeavour was made to trace the cause of the infection, with what success may be gleaned from the table given below. This table shows conclusively that Leyton's sanitary condition, judged by the standard of Enteric Fever incidence, is satisfactory. 15 Case. Sex. Age. Yrs. Where Treated. Result.

DIPHTHERIA. 175 cases were notified, against 147 in 1913. 29 deaths occurred, a case-fatality of 16.5 per cent. In 1907 the case-fatality was 14.7 per cent. „ 1908 „ „ 8.2 „ 1909 „ „ 13.4 „ 1910 ,, ,, 13.2 ,, „ 1911 „ „ 8.0 „ „ 1912 „ „ 14.2 „ „ 1913 „ „ 75 „ „ 1914 „ „ 16.5 „ 16 Our death.rate from Diphtheria for the year 1914 was .22 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .15; of the 97 Great Towns, .16; and of London, T6. PUERPERAL FEVER. 10 cases of this disease were notified, and three deaths occurred ; a case.fatality of 30 0 per cent. The fatality per cent. of the total births is .11. Two cases occurred in the practice of midwives, and 2 other cases were attended by women not on the register. The County is the authority for the administration of the Midwives Act, and the County Medical Officer of Health has been promptly notified of all cases coming under his jurisdiction. Disinfection of premises and clothing has been systematically carried out. ATTACK RATE PER 1,000 OF THE POPULATION. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Enteric Fever. Puerperal Fever.

This disease was the cause of 15 deaths during the year, against 31 in 1913. Our death-rate from Measles, therefore, was .11 per 1,000 of the population; that of England and Wales, .24; of the 97 Great Towns, .35; and of London, .31. The 15 deaths were distributed throughout the year as follows :— Jan. Feb. Mar. April May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. 0 0 0 5 7 I 0 1 1 0 0 0 13 deaths occurred in children under five years of age, i.e., in children who do not attend school, and 2 between five and ten years. I received from the school teachers information in respect of 573 cases of Measles. The Health Visitor paid 299 visits to these cases, and gave the parents suitable advice, especially as to the necessity for seeking medical attention. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough caused 21 deaths, against 18 in 1913. 8 of these deaths occurred in children under one year of age, 9 in those between one and two years, 3 in those of two and under five years, and 1 between five and ten years. Our death-rate from Whooping Cough was .16 per 1,000 of the population ; that of England and Wales being '21 ; of the 97 Great Towns, .25; and of London, .20. DIARRHCEA AND ENTERITIS. Diarrhoea and Enteritis caused 55 deaths, 39 of which were of infants under one year of age. 18 Our death-rate from Diarrhoea and Enteritis under two years was 17.14 per 1,000 births; that of England and Wales 20.41; of the 97 Great Towns, 26.09; and of London, 27.64. In 1905 these diseases caused the deaths of 52 children under 5 years of age. .. 1906 ,, „ „ „ 116 ,, „ ,, 1907 ,, ,, ,, ,, 37 ,, ,, ,, 1908 ,, ,, ,, ,, 36 ,, ,, ,, 1909 ,, ,, ,, ,, 34 ,, „ ,,1910 ,, ,, ,, ,, 16 ,, ., ,, 1911 ,, ,, ,, ,, 110 ,, ,, „ 1912 ,, ,, ,, ,, 25 ,, „ ,, 1913 ,, ,, ,, ,, 47 ,, ,, „ 1914 ,, ,, ,, ,, 48 ,, ,, CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS, ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS AND ACUTE POLIOENCEPHALITIS. Two cases of Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis, and 1 case of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis have been notified during the year. The following are particulars of the cases : ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS. A girl, 3½ and a boy, 1½ (brother and sister), were notified in September. The boy was taken ill first, and his sister developed the disease six days later. Both were typical instances of the malady with considerable involvement. They had both previously been healthy, and the source of infection could not be traced. The cases were subsequently removed to a General Hospital and disinfection was carried out. CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS. The only case was that of a married woman, previously healthy, who was taken ill suddenly and died 18 days later in a General Hospital to which she had been removed. The origin of the disease could not be traced. The premises were disinfected. 19 I did not consider verification of the diagnosis necessary as the histories of the symptoms were fairly typical and paralysis was present in all the cases. However, should bacteriological confirmation have been indicated specimens of spinal fluid, etc., could have been sent to Dr. Thresh, with whom the Council have an arrangement for such work. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Under Section 130, Public Health Act, 1875, the Local Government Board has made Regulations adding Ophthalmia Neonatorum to the list of diseases compulsorily notifiable. These Regulations, which came into force on 1st April, 1914, compel Medical Practitioners and Midwives attending maternity cases to notify to the Medical Officer of Health all cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum which commence in the babies within 21 days from the date of their birth. The object of this Order is to diminish the incidence of blindness among children, which is mainly due to this disease. 15 such cases were notified in Leyton by Medical Practitioners and 1 other by a midwife. All were visited and revisited to observe the progress of the disease and to advise medical treatment until cure was effected. At the end of the year all the cases had cleared up satisfactorily. It may be added that when first visited, most were found to be comparatively mild. TUBERCULOSIS. 141 deaths occurred from all forms of Tuberculosis, which represents a death-rate of T07 per 1,000 of the population. The number of deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis was 111, and the death-rate per 1,000 of the population, .8; that of London being 1.39. Under the " Tuberculosis Regulations, 1912," notifications of 288 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and 100 of other forms of Tuberculosis have been received during the year. 20 These cases are now visited by the Tuberculosis Officer or his staff and verbal and written instructions given as to the necessary precautions to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. Sanitary conditions have been enquired into and defects found to exist have been remedied. Disinfectants have been supplied and disinfection of premises carried out in the cases of death or where sufferers from the disease have vacated their dwellings. Bacteriological examination of sputum has been undertaken at the request of the patients' Medical Attendants. Particulars of the above work have been recorded on cards which are kept in the Public Health Department. The Tuberculosis Dispensary, which was formerly held at the Town Hall, was transferred in March, 1914, to convenient premises situated at 180, High Road, Leyton, and these were formally opened on 16th May last by Alderman Belsham, ViceChairman, Public Health Committee, Essex County Council. Here Dr Pitt attends twice a week, viz., on Mondays, 2.30 to 4.30, and Thursdays, 6 to 8 p.m., and the whole of the efforts against Tuberculosis on the clinical side are carried out from this institution. Patients referred by.their Medical Attendants for his opinion are here examined ; others come regularly for treatment In addition, children who are found in school with the incipient signs of Phthisis, or who display some tendency to Consumption, are sent to the Tuberculosis Officer. Great importance is attached to the examination of contacts to Tuberculosis cases; these are duly examined for disease in its early stages. Close co-operation is maintained between the Tuberculosis Officer, who is appointed by the Essex County Council, and the Medical Officer of Health. The arrangements as set forth in last year's report have been continued. Dr. Pitt has been appointed by the Leyton Council Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis purposes at a nominal 21 salary of ten guineas per annum. In this capacity he visits patients as well as in his capacity of Tuberculosis Officer. Thus unnecessary visiting by the Medical Officer of Health, as well as by the Tuberculosis Officer, is avoided. Every Monday morning the Medical Officer of Health transmits to the Tuberculosis Officer a list of the notifications he has received during the previous week. If on visitation the latter finds any work is needed in connection with a case which properly falls to the duty of the Local Authority, such as disinfection, remedying of sanitary defects, &c., he informs the Medical Officer of Health, who promptly has the work carried out. Notifications of cases of Phthisis and other forms of Tuberculosis have been received from the Institutions set forth on the following page. 22 Pulmonary. Other forms. Total.

At the beginning of the month there was frost in the South, but this was succeeded by a week during which the temperature rose above the normal. From the 11th until the 24th there was another period of cold weather and frost, during which the mean temperature was below the normal and the highest temperature recorded from day to day was not many degrees above freezing point. The last week in the month was mild, temperatures of 55° being recorded in some localities. Fog was commonly observed on the coasts, being most frequent on the Western coasts. With East winds prevalent the weather was mainly dry and cold, and it turned to rain and mild weather with Westerly winds. Some snow fell, but, generally speaking, the rainfall was below the average. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 43.5°; minimum, 35.3°. Rainfall at Leyton, .37 inch. February.—Mild, wet and windy. The month was warmer than the average, the temperature being 50° or more at Camden Square, London, during the first 15 days. There was a deficiency of sunshine. Fogs were rarely reported on the coasts, and they occurred mainly towards the end of the month. The rainfall throughout was excessive. Strong winds and gales were of frequent occurrence, depressions were numerous and were in many localities accompanied by heavy downfalls of rain. 27 Mean temperatures: Maximum, 49.7°; minimum, 40.0°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.90 inches. March.—Dull and wet. Temperatures were mainly above the average, especially in the earlier part of the month, the later part being colder. The readings of bright sunshine were below the average. Rainfall was excessive throughout the country; for example, at Isleworth it was the heaviest fall experienced in March during the last 35 years. Similarly at Camden Square, London, the total was the largest noted since readings were begun 57 years ago. Local gales and depressions were numerous, and were usually accompanied by rain, either locally or over the whole country; between the 19th and the 26th thunderstorms were of frequent occurrence. Fogs on the coast were reported infrequently. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 50'2°; minimum, 38-8°. Rainfall at Leyton, 3'89 inches. April.—Sunny, mild and dry. Over the Kingdom generally the weather was warmer than the average, though occasional days were still rather cold. Bright sunshine also was in excess of the normal, and at Westminster there was a daily average of over 7 hours. 28 Rainfall was less than the normal, being 62 per cent. of the average throughout England and Wales. Winds were experienced during the first 10 days of the month, together with rain and moderate temperature; thereafter the atmosphere proved calm and dry, and with the unusual sunshine the days were warm, but the nights cool. Fruit blossom and potatoes suffered from the cold (sometimes frosty) nights. Fogs were prevalent, especially along the Western coast, and to a less extent along the Eastern. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 59'4°; minimum, 42.0°. Rainfall at Leyton, .75 inch. May.—Cloudy and dry. On the whole the temperature for the month was less than the average, but there were variations from week to week, the first being mild, the second and fourth cold, and the third very warm. Dry and bright weather from the 13th caused a rise in the temperature, which reached 80° on the 22nd, but this came to a close with thunderstorms. Untimely night frosts then occurred, doing much damage to fruit and other trees and vegetation generally. Bright sunshine was in a deficiency over the Kingdom, but a slight excess was noted in the South-East. Rainfall on the whole was below the normal, though some local excesses were observed. High pressure alternated with depressions, and the highest barometric reading was obtained during the third week. 29 Fogs on the coast were uncommon. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 62.5°; minimum, 45.4°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.66 inches. June.—Bright and dry. Warmer weather than the average, to the extent of nearly 1°, was experienced during the month. As a whole the rainfall was below the normal, and in some districts the diminution was marked, but this fine dry weather was interspersed by thunderstorms occurring locally and usually with heavy rain. Bright sunshine was in very marked excess in England, notably along the South and South-East coast. A departure from the normal was recorded in the pressure distribution, so that in all parts of the country winds from the North-West and North-East, with a tendency to low temperatures, obtained for the first half of the month ; they were succeeded by South or SouthWest winds with increased temperature. Fogs were reported on the coast in the second and third weeks, followed by a week of clear air and then again fog on the West on the 27th. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 70.4°; minimum, 51.2°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1*91 inches. July.—Changeable. Rainy in South and West. The month opened with hot weather, on the 1st temperatures of over 90° being recorded at Isleworth and Greenwich. In Central and Eastern England readings of over 80° were obtained on the 13th and 30 14th, and in other parts on the 20th or 21st. During the last week of the month the maximum temperature was low and though this cold weather reduced the mean temperature for the month, it still proved to be above the average. Earthquake movements were reported on the 1st at Tavistock and Teignmouth. Bright sunshine was variable at different stations, and on the whole was below normal. In Scotland, on the English East coast, and in the North of Ireland the rainfall was less than usual; on the other hand in West and South-West England, also in Wales large totals were recorded. During the second and third weeks fogs were numerous on the coasts East and West, but the Channel usually enjoyed a clear atmosphere. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 72.5°; minimum, 56.1°. Rainfall at Leyton, 1.25 inches. August.—Sunny, warm and dry. Cool rainy weather marked the first eight days but this was followed by warm weather continuing above the normal for the rest of the month. The range of temperature generally was not large and but few intensely hot days were experienced. The duration of bright sunshine exceeded the normal especially in North-Western areas. Rainfall in the aggregate was below normal with few exceptions, and over a wide area in the SouthEastern counties the deficiency was considerable. At Margate the total amounted to but 12 per cent. of the average. 31 Fogs were experienced on the coasts not infrequently, and in the last week had extended to the South coast. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 74.9°; minimum, 55.8°. Rainfall at Leyton, .87 inch. September.—Dry, warm ; then cool. During the first fortnight higher temperatures than normal were experienced, but the contrary occurred during the last two weeks. Frost was reported during the month from all parts of the country. Bright sunshine was in excess except along the South of England and the Northernmost parts of Scotland ; in South-East of England the average was exceeded by more than two hours. Rainfall over the Kingdom generally was below the average, though in Scotland and the English Channel the reverse obtained. Over a large area there was no rain during the month except between the 8th and 18th. Coastal fogs were not frequent and occurred mainly on the Western coasts. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 67'5°; minimum, 49.2°. Rainfall at Leyton, .72 inch. October.—Dull and mild. The average temperature for the month was above the normal and during the first ten days temperatures of 65° were common, the highest being on the 3rd when 70° was registered at Halstead. 32 Bright sunshine was below the average being onlv 70 to 80 per cent. of the normal in many localities. There was no rain for many days the dry weather of the first fortnight of the month being continuous with that experienced during the last 10 days of September. Coastal fogs were infrequent; between the 15th and the 27th they were reported occasionally on the Western coasts and less frequently on the East coast. There was a notable absence of gales over the Kingdom and during the whole month very little wind was experienced. Mean temperatures: Maximum, 58.9°; minimum, 45.7°. Rainfall at Leyton, .80 inch. November.-—Rainy and rough. Warm weather was experienced during the first fortnight and the last week but from the 15th to the 25th there was a decidedly cold spell, during which very sharp frosts were found and the highest daily temperatures were lower than the minimum temperatures of the first-mentioned periods. Bright sunshine was recorded in excess of the normal amount over the country as a whole. Aurora was observed on the 11th at Aberdeen. Rain was frequent and excessive, many heavy showers occurred, and over the United Kingdom generally the total fall was much above the average. Fogs and mist were reported both on the coast and inland, but were usually light and seldom persistent. 33 Mean temperatures: Maximum, 51.1°; minimum, 41.2°. Rainfall at Leyton, 2.53 inches. December.—Rain, floods, gales. Weather warmer than the normal until the 18th, was succeeded by colder weather with severe frosts; the lowest temperature recorded was 7°, viz., at Balmoral on the 22nd and at Braemar on the 25th. On the 23rd and 24th at some places in the Midlands the thermometer failed to rise to 32°. Dense fog accompanied the cold calm atmosphere of the 24th and extended to the coasts but during the month coastal fogs were infrequent. Bright sunshine occurred in some places to a greater extent than the normal, as at Blackpool, but in a few places there was a deficiency. An excessive rainfall marked the month, being in many parts without precedent. In the Thames valley more rain fell than during any December during the last 50 years. Snow fell during the last fortnight but as a rule it quickly disappeared. There were many gales during the month, some very violent, and one on the 28th accompanied by heavy snowfall. Mean temperatures : Maximum, 47.1°; minimum, 39.3°. Rainfall at Leyton, 5.26. 34 SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE WAR. 1. Changes in Staff and Emergency Arrangements. With the mobilisation of the Territorials on August 4th, Dr. Taylor joined his Battery in the Honourable Artillery Company, and his post of Medical Officer of Health was filled by the temporary appointment of the Assistant Medical Officer as Deputy Medical Officer of Health. Mr. E. E. Jacobs, Junior Clerk in the Public Health Office, enlisted in the Army in September, and his post was filled by the temporary engagement of a Junior Clerk. 2. Action Taken by the Medical Officer of Health to Co-operate with the Military Authorities. No troops have been quartered in this district. In several instances cases of infectious disease have occurred in households in which a soldier has been temporarily residing, (home on leave, etc.), and the military authorities have been at once acquainted with all the circumstances of the case, and appropriate measures have been suggested to avoid risk of infection among the troops. This co-operation has been prompt and effective. NOTIFIED INFECTIOUS DISEASE AMONG HIS MAJESTY'S FORCES. No cases of Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Enteric Fever, Typhus, or Erysipelas were notified between 1st August and 31st December in this district as occurring among soldiers or sailors. Two soldiers were discharged from the service on account of Tuberculosis of the lungs and were notified by the military authorities. Each had previously been notified in civil life by a Medical Practitioner as having Consumption, one 3 years and the other 15 months previously. The former had been a barman, and the latter was an ex-soldier who had re-enlisted. 35 NOTES ON SANITARY WORK AND MATTERS INCIDENTAL THERETO. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The sewer in Shortlands Road to the length of 205 yards has been re-laid. Many private drains have been re-constructed, for particulars of which see the Sanitary Inspector's Report. SEWAGE DISPOSAL. The scheme for admitting our sewage, together with that of several neighbouring Authorities, into the London County Council's sewers has not yet materialised. The new circular tank at the Sewage Works was completed on the 24th July, and was opened on the following day by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee. It was found to work satisfactorily, and was capable of dealing with the whole of the dry weather flow of sewage. In order that the winter flow should be treated in the same manner, it was deemed advisable that a second circular tank should be constructed. It was considered that this additional tank accommodation would be required for the treatment of the surface water should the Council decide to join in the London County Council's sewerage system. The Council having approved of the provision of a second tank, the matter was put in hand, and the Contractor began work on November 9th. A mess-room has been built for the use of the employees in the Destructor Works adjoining the boundary wall in Auckland Road; the building comprises mess-room, cloak and locker-room and sanitary accommodation. A similar room has been constructed for the use of the employees in the Sewage Disposal Works. 12,075 tons of sludge have been purchased of us during the year. 36 POLLUTION OF RIVERS AND STREAMS IN THE DISTRICT. The Dagenham Brook and Waterworks River continues to be polluted by the effluents of Walthamstow and Leyton. REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF HOUSE REFUSE. No alteration in the system reported upon in the Reports of the past two years has taken place. Each house has its refuse removed twice weekly. The open two-wheeled cart is still used for the collection. 18,835 tons of house refuse have been burnt in the Destructor. In 1913 20,673 tons, and in 1912 21,312 tons of house refuse were similarly burnt. In September, repairs to the furnace fronts of the Refuse Destructor were found necessary, which left only four cells available for use. The whole of the house refuse could not be dealt with in the Destructor, and the Council gave directions that the surplus should be temporarily buried and covered with clinker in the excavations on the Coronation Gardens extension. FARCY. A case of farcy in a horse occurred in the district. The animal was slaughtered and the premises disinfected under the supervision of the County Inspector. OFFENSIVE TRADES. Two applications were received for the establishment of the trade of a fish fryer, viz., one in the High Road, Leytonstone, and one in Cann Hall Road. In each case permission was granted by the Council, but no further steps were taken by the applicants. The Council has also granted permission for the establishment of the trades of a tripe boiler, fat melter, fat extractor, gut scraper and bone boiler at premises in Birkbeck Road, 37 SANITARY CONVENIENCES. The Council has now finally decided to build an underground convenience for both sexes at the junction of Church Road and Lea Bridge Road. The site has been purchased and the estimated cost of the building of the conveniences is £1,650 As pointed out in previous reports, a sanitary convenience is urgently needed at a spot near the intersection of the Crownfield, Cann Hall and Leytonstone Roads. WATER SUPPLY OF THE DISTRICT. The supply of water to the district by the Metropolitan Water Board is quite satisfactory in all respects. MILK SUPPLY. As reported in former years very few cows are now kept in the district. Only 6 cowkeepers, who among them keep 51 cows, now remain. Some of the difficulties encountered in the endeavour to ensure the supply of clean milk to consumers have been pointed out in previous Reports. Endeavour has been made by the Medical Officer of Health as far as possible to discourage the selling of milk by the small general dealer, but his powers in this direction are very limited. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. One new licence, renewable annually, was granted to a purchaser of an old-established business, of which the outgoing occupier had previously held a slaughterhouse licence. UNSOUND OR DISEASED MEAT. A bullock carcase extensively affected with tuberculosis was found in a slaughterhouse by one of the Sanitary Inspectors and was seized, and by the order of a magistrate was destroyed. 38 The Council took proceedings in the Police Court, and a fine of £10 and costs was inflicted. On two occasions a carcase of a pig affected with tuberculosis was discovered by one of the Inspectors. In the first instance the carcase was that of a Danish pig which had been examined and passed by the Danish Government Officials, and had been purchased by the butcher in one of the City Corporation Markets. The disease involved one gland in the neck. The whole carcase was destroyed. In the second case the pig carcase was in good condition, and the disease in the glands of the throat being small in amount could have been detected only by a person skilled in meat inspection. The whole of the carcase and viscera were destroyed. In both instances there was no doubt that the shopkeeper had acted in good faith, and the Committee took no action. HOUSING. There is a sufficiency of houses for the working classes in the district, and in general these are in good condition and fit for habitation. The majority of the inhabitants of Leyton are occupied during their working hours in London. Within recent years building operations have been carried on very rapidly in the district, to meet the needs of clerks, artisans, and such workers who find the district conveniently situated with regard to their places of business. During the year, only 79 houses have been erected, but this diminution in the rate of building principally arises from the fact that there are now very few vacant sites in the district. House-to-house inspection is regularly carried on, especially in the poorer neighbourhoods, in which it is found that houses tend to become more or less insanitary chiefly owing to the class of tenants occupying them. 39 In connection with the inspections under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, three cottages in Browning Road, being unfit for human habitation, have been demolished voluntarily by the owner on the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, and three new cottages erected in their place. In addition, 24 cottages in the same road were found to be in need of extensive alterations. Damp courses were inserted in the exterior walls of all, and general renovation carried out. In 11 of the cottages the drainage was very unsatisfactory; accordingly the drains at the rear were entirely re-laid, new sanitary conveniences were provided, and sinks fitted in the sculleries. In addition, separate water supply was laid on to each of these cottages. In another part of the district 10 very old cottages unfit for human habitation, which were structurally not worth repair, and some of which were ill-planned with regard to their situation, were voluntarily pulled down, and will be replaced by the owner by suitable dwellings.

Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, states that the Medical Officer of Health shall report specifically in his Annual Report on the administration of these Acts in workshops and workplaces in the district, and send such report to the Secretary of State. Factories.—As regards factories, the administration of these Acts is chiefly under the supervision of H.M. Inspector of Factories. 16 visits were made to factories during 1914, and nuisances dealt with and remedied in 4 instances. Workshops and Workplaces.—The workshops and workplaces have been inspected and re-inspected, and where any contravention of the Factory and Workshop Acts has been noted, or any nuisance remediable under the Public Health Acts discovered, the premises have been re-visited until the defects found have been abated. The cleanliness and general condition of the rooms are for the most part satisfactory. Frequently the ventilation of the rooms is not good, although the means of ventilation is suTcient if used fully and correctly; advice is then given to the occupier, which is generally all that is necessary to put the matter right. At the beginning of 1914 the number of workshops and workplaces on the register was 303, and it remains the same at the end of the year. The workrooms are grouped as follows:— Manufacture of blouses, underclothing, &c. 80 ,, ,, boots, shoes, &c 19 ,, ,, ties, neckwear, &c. 17 ,, ,, leather goods 1 ,, ,, walking sticks 1 „ ,, brushes 22 ,, ,, polishes 1 ,, ,, scales 1 ,, ,, fancy paper articles 1 ,, ,, heating apparatus 1 47 Manufacture of ether sprays 1 ,, „ wooden boxes 2 „ ,, mats 1 ,, ,, drawing instruments 1 Dressmaking 33 Millinery 16 Tailoring and alteration of costumes 26 Art-needlework and embroideries 2 Corset-making 1 Bakehouses 44 Laundries 15 Cabinet-making, &c. 5 Shop-fitting 1 Picture framing 1 Stonemason 1 Fixing leaden seals 1 Brick-building 1 Chopping firewood 5 Rag-sorting 3 Cycle repairing and motor works 3 Wheelwrights 4 Wire-workers 3 Printing and book-binding 4 Sheet steel and asbestos works 1 Cork-cutting 1 Manufacture of military water bottles 1 303 66 workshops have been removed from the register during the year, and of these 37 are closed entirely. In 15 cases the occupiers re-opened at another address in the district, and in 14 instances it was found that the occupiers had left the neighbourhood. As required by Section 133 of this Act, we notified H.M. Inspector of Factories of 27 occupiers of workshops who had 48 failed to affix in their workrooms an Abstract of the Act in accordance with Section 128. 804 inspections of workshops have been made during the year, and defects numbering ,285 were found to exist. On the necessary steps being taken the nuisances were remedied. Two nuisances under this heading remained unabated at the end of the year 1913, but the necessary work was carried out and H.M. Inspector advised of this early in January of this year. Homework.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, provides that we shall be notified of the addresses of outworkers (in certain specified trades), living in our district, twice yearly. A register is kept of the names and addresses of these outworkers, Notices were received from H.M. Inspector of Factories of nuisances remediable under the Public Health Acts existing in factories and workshops, details of which 1 give below, with the result of the action taken:— Notice received. Description of Premises. Nuisance notified. Reply to Factory Inspector. Result of action taken. 26/1/14 Workshop Dilapidated walls 20/2/14 Walls repaired 26/1/14 ,, Workshop overcrowded 13/2/14 Nuisance abated 10/3/14 Workplace No proper sanitary accommodation 24/4/14 ,, ,, 10/3/14 Workshop Fumes from gas stove entering workshop 24/4/14 ,, ,, 1/4/14 ,, W.C. pan foul 8/4/14 W.

Powers under the Act are given to the District Council for controlling the conditions under which the work is done in the homes of the workers, and generally a hygienic standard is secured. All insanitary conditions found to exist are dealt with and the necessary action taken to abate nuisances. Infectious diseases occurred in the homes of 10 outworkers, but immediate steps were taken to prevent the spread of the disease; the outwork was disinfected by us, and the Medical Officer of the Council in whose district the employer resided was advised of the case. In instances where the patient was treated at home, further work was forbidden on the premises until all risk of the infection was over. In 1914, 666 outworkers were notified by other Councils, and 14 other addresses sent to us in error were drafted to the proper authorities. Lists containing 271 names have been forwarded to other Councils in whose districts outworkers, employed by Leyton firms, reside. To Walthamstow 103 „ Hackney 60 „ West Ham 54 „ Stepney 36 „ Bethnal Green 2 „ Poplar 4 „ Enfield 1 „ Islington 2 „ Guildhall 4 „ Holborn 2 „ Whitechapel 1 „ Stamford Hill 1 „ Woodford 1 271 50 Circular letters are sent out in February and August to employers who neglect to forward their lists of outworkers by the first day of these months, with the result that the necessary information is generally forthcoming on the receipt of these Reminder Notices without further trouble. 1,795 visits were paid to outworkers' premises and 1,587 inspections of their homes were made. In 208 cases it was found that the addresses returned on the list were incorrect, or that the outworker had removed since the previous visit. Every effort was made to trace removals. Uncleanly and insanitary conditions in 431 instances were found and dealt with. TRAMWAY EMPLOYEES. By the direction of the Council, the Medical Officer of Health examines all men applying for the post of motorman or conductor on the tramways. In times of peace the numbers of men thus sent up for examination have not been many, but with the outbreak of war the numbers increased enormously owing to the enlistment in the services of many of the tramway employees. From August 4th to December 31st, 63 men were examined by the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. This great increase of work was found to interfere with his other duties; accordingly, the Council has now made other arrangements. 51 REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE TEMPORARY ISOLATION HOSPITAL FOR THE YEAR 1914. The Temporary Isolation Hospital situated in Auckland Road and having accommodation for 70 Scarlet Fever and 22 Diphtheria patients has proved adequate for the needs of the district. The Nursing Staff, under the superintendence of the Matron, have performed their duties in a satisfactory manner, and the Itestimony of letters received from patients or their friends shews the feelings of gratitude which have been inspired. STAFF. Medical Superintendent, J. F. Taylor, M.R.C.S., D.P.H.; Deputy Medical Superintendent, A. Ball, M.D., D.P.H.; Matron, Miss E. Ryan; Sister, Miss F. Pikeman; Charge Nurses, Miss K. Oswald and Miss S. Barnard. In. addition there are 11 Assistant Nurses. The female domestic staff number 12. The male staff consists of two Porters, the part-time services of the two Ambulance Porters, and a Relief Porter. / IMPROVEMENTS. The new corrugated iron building foreshadowed in last year's Report, to be used as a Dining and Recreation Room for the Nurses, was completed in the summer, and was opened by the Chairman of the Hospital Sub-Committee. It is a comfortable, cheerful room, tastefully furnished, and has been much appreciated. The small portion at the east end of the building has been adapted as an office for the Matron— a much-needed improvement. A new electric bell has been fitted at the entrance gate, and by means of a switch is available either in the Porter's lodge or in the Disinfecting buildings. 52 PATIENTS. The total number of patients treated during the year was 398. In 1913 the number was 321, in 1912 305, in 1911 372, in 1910 442. There were admitted 271 Scarlet Fever and 127 Diphtheria cases. The total number of patients' days in hospital was 17,197. The total amount expended on the Hospital was ,£3,190 15s. 9d., which gives an average cost of 3s. 8.5d. per patient per diem. The amount expended on provisions was £893 3s. 0d., which includes the cost of food for the Staff. This gives a daily average of 1s. 0.4d. per patient. STATISTICAL RETURNS. Admissions. At all ages.

DIPHTHERIA. The number of oases of Diphtheria admitted—127—is the largest in the history of the Hospital. During recent years the following are the numbers received:—1913, 98; 1912, 83; 1911, 109; 1910, 90. Many of the cases were in a very grave condition on admission: some indeed were quite beyond hope of recovery, and were moved to hospital more for the protection of the other members of the family than as a remedial measure for the sufferer. The severity of the type of disease chiefly accounts for the increased mortality, and another factor was the delay in some cases in the use of anti-toxin. Of the 23 fatal cases only 5 were injected with serum during the first two days of the illness, 12 were injected between the 3rd and 5th days, and 5 did not receive anti-toxin until the 6th or subsequent days, one being as Jong delayed as the 11th day. The causes of death were as follows:— Toxaemia 12 Syncope 6* Laryngeal 2 Paralysis 2 Pulmonary Congestion 1† * including 2 following Tracheotomy. † following Tracheotomy. 54 The amount of money expended on the Hospital during the year was £3,190 15s. 9cl., and is divisible into the following items:— £ s. d.

TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE LEYTON URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL. Gentlemen, I beg to submit to you my Twenty-fourth Annual Report for the year ending December 31st, 1914. INFECTIOUS DISEASE. 1,117 cases of Infectious Diseases were notified during the above-mentioned period. Under the direction and supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, the houses where cases of Infectious Diseases occur are visited, instructions given as to isolation of the patients, and in the cases of those treated at home subsequent visits are made to see that the isolation is being properly carried out. Enquiries are made as to schools attended, number of inmates, and how employed, and instructions are given as to the precautions to be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease. Appended is a summary of the work in connection therewith : Houses disinfected and the sanitary arrangements examined and tested : Tuberculosis Cases202 Other Infectious Diseases 546 Loads of infected bedding removed to be disinfected at the Council's Steam Disinfector and returned 665 Books belonging to Public Institutions disinfected 85 Number of articles of wearing apparel disinfected 177 56 Disinfectants are supplied in cases of Infectious Disease, and can be obtained at the Town Hall at any time during office hours INSPECTION OF THE DISTRICT AND ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Seventh Annual Report on the work of the School Medical Service in Leyton under the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act of 1907. The Report resembles that of last year, being drawn up on lines recommended by the Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education and the tables which he has suggested being adopted. As in previous years, Medical Inspection in the Schools has been concerned mainly with "Entrants" and "Leavers." A School Clinic dealing with children suffering from defective vision and defective teeth has been instituted at the Town Hall during the year and, in conjunction with the clinic for the treatment of minor ailments mentioned in last year's Annual Report, is working smoothly. The Board of Education has now sanctioned an arrangement whereby children who are not excluded from School can, under certain circumstances, receive their attendance mark at School in respect of the time spent at the School Clinic, if a certificate is furnished by the School Medical Officer to the Head Teacher. The work of the School Medical Officer has been added to year by year since the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act of 1907 came into force. More and more of his time is absorbed, and as his Public Health duties do not diminish, the Education Committee will in the near future be called upon to consider the question of additional assistance, both medical and clerical. My best thanks are due to the Members and Officials of the Education Committee for the courtesy and assistance which they have ever extended to me. I am, Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED BALL. 74 CHANGES IN THE STAFF. ABSENCE OF SCHOOL MEDICAL OFFICER ON MILITARY SERVICE. On August 4th, 1914, the order was given for the mobilisation of the Territorial Forces; this necessitated Dr. Taylor's relinquishing his civil duties, and he thereupon joined his Battery as Surgeon-Captain in the Honourable Artillery Company. The Council appointed me Deputy School Mcdical Officer to carry out Dr. Taylor's duties during his absence, and the vacancy thus caused was filled by the appointment, as Assistant Medical Officer, of Dr. Edith Shannon, who had had experience of School Medical Inspection under other Authorities. SCHOOL NURSES. Nurse Fry left your service in November, when she received a school post under the London County Council. She was succeeded by Miss Bessie Clipstone, who was appointed to assist in Medical Inspection in the Schools. It was found necessary to make an additional appointment of a Nurse to assist the Dentist and Oculist at the School Clinic and to carry out other similar duties under the direction of the School Medical Officer. For this post Miss Lilian Dodd was selected, and she commenced work on November 16th. APPOINTMENT OF OFFICERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL CLINIC. Dr. Arthur Cummings was appointed School Oculist, and it was arranged that he should attend on two mornings in each week of the School Terms to examine and prescribe spectacles for children found to have defective vision. Mr. P. E. Chandler, L.D.S., received the post of School Dentist as a whole-time officer, his duties to include the inspection of children's teeth in the Schools and the treatment at the Clinic of those suffering from dental caries. 75 CHILDREN ON THE REGISTERS. The number of children attending the Elementary Schools in Leyton was as follows:— December, 1910 c20,337 1911 20,800 ,, 1912 21,025 ,, 1913 21,109 ,, 1914 21,237 Following the practice of previous years, the School Medical Officer has visited each School to give the Head Teachers notice of an impending Medical Inspection, and advantage has been taken of the opportunity thus given to discuss matters affecting the welfare of the children. Head Teachers send notices to the parents or guardians of children about to be inspected informing them of the date and time when their children will be examined and inviting them to be present. These invitations were largely accepted by the parents; thus over 85% of the entrants were accompanied by a parent, and 76% of the girl-leavers, while in about 80% of the "intermediate" group a parent attended. Examinations were usually conducted in a class-room, and in some instances in a Teacher's room. In the case of 45 children the parents declared their objection to medical inspection at School. This is quite an insignificant number, and the attitude taken up was chiefly due to misconception on the part of the parents as to the utility of examination. The objections were received at the following Schools:— Cann Hall Road 5 Canterbury Road 5 Capworth Street 2 Church Road 1 Farmer Road 2 Goodall Road 10 Kirkdale Road 1 Newport Road 1 Norlington Road 2 Ruckholt Road 11 St. Joseph's 2 Trumpington Road 3 76 Table 1.—Number of Children Inspected A "Routine" Age.

"The attendance of parents at the medical inspection averaged 80 per cent. iin all cases, except in that of the elder boys', where the attendance was 50 per cent. This, taken with the very few cases of objection to examination, is a gratifying criterion of the interest taken in the work of inspection by the parents in this district, an interest which is indicated also by the request of many parents that their children should be examined, though they do not enter into the groups of "entrants" and "leavers." CLOTHING AND FOOTGEAR. "The state of clothing and footgear was found to be fairly equal in all groups, the percentage in entrants and leavers being practically the same. The tendency among parents of the younger children appears to be towards overloading the upper part of the body with clothing, which is often fastened too tightly, while the lower limbs are often thinly clad, with short stockings and thin and worn shoes. This probably is responsible in greait measure for the prevalence of bronchial catarrh among the younger children, who are rendered prone to chills by the fact that the lower extremities, where the blood supply is leasit plentiful, are exposed to cold and wet, while the upper part of the body, which is well supplied with blood, is tightly and heavily covered, causing impediment to free respiration, and causing the child fatigue by .the mechanical effort of lifting a weight of clothing with each breath. CLEANLINESS OF SKIN. "The small percentage of children actually found affected with vermin is evidence of the efficacy of medical inspection as a factor in bringing home to the parents a sense of their responsibilities, although the somewhat high percentage of children (18 91 per cent.) with nits in the hair, without the presence of lice, indicates that there had been some cleansing operations in preparation for the medical inspection. The number of children whose skins were flea-bitten was appreciably larger. NUTRITION. " It will be noted that the number of children whose nutrition is below normal is larger in the case of entrants than in that of leavers. A connection nvay be traced between this and the larger number of cases with enlarged tonsils and adenoids among entrants, conditions which may be responsible for defective nutrition in young children. In some instances parental ignorance of food values plays a large part in the causation of defective nutrition. Too frequently children are allowed to come to school without breakfast, or carrying pieces of bread in the hand, and the children are not encouraged to cultivate a liking for nutritious food, but are often allowed to choose their own. One is often told that the child " does not like milk," but " prefers tea." NOSE AND THROAT. "The prevalence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids in this district is high, reaching 19 .per cent, in the case of tonsils and 5 per cent, in the case of adenoids, exclusive of a number of cases of children who are habitual mouth-breathers, in whom adenoids would probably be diagnosed by digital examination. The systematic teaching of correct methods of breathing, and the practice of what may be described as " handkerchief drill " in infant classes should go far towards remedying these conditions. Chronic post-nasal catarrh, which is very prevalent among younger children, is a noteworthy factor in the causation of these affections, and the encouragement by the teaching staffs of the use of the handkerchief by infant children is a matter of great importance. 92 VISION. "There is a large number of oases of defective vision, probably in some measure due to the fact that in an urban district such as Leyton vision is not used as a rule for long distances as in country districts, and the children have their eyes constantly focussed for short distances. These defects are being dealt with at the School Clinic. EAR DISEASE. "Cases of discharging ears are now being satisfactorily treated at the School Clinic, and the percentage of cases suffering from this condition is likely to diminish markedly. Many oases of deafness are temporary, being due to accumulation of wax in the ears. TEETH. "The percentage of decayed teeth and oral sepsis shows how necessary was the provision of a Dental Clinic. The use of the toothbrush is not by any means so general as one could wish, though among the older children there are evidences that the toothbrush is no longer considered as a mere luxury. It is to be recommended that the daily use of the toothbrush be advocated by the teachers in infant schools, as a means of preventing too early decay of the milk teeth. HEART AND CIRCULATION. "Cases of heart murmurs are by no means uncommon, and are often caused by itemporary conditions. Most of the cases of definite heart disease had at some time suffered from rheumatism, chorea, or scarlet fever, or had had frequent attacks of "sore throat." There were several cases of dilated heart, notably among boys, which were due to excessive exercise—cycling and football. 93 LUNGS. "The percentage of tuberculosis of lungs was "08 in the younger children and '2 among the older ones. In addition, there were a number of suspected cases of phthisis. Some of the numerous cases of bronchial catarrh or bronchitis among the younger children are latent cases of tuberculosis, and it is well to lay stress on the fact that frequent and repeated attacks of bronchitis in young children cannot occur without more or less permanent damage to the lung tissue, and these are the cases which in later life form a suitable breeding-ground for the tubercle bacillus. In this connection the importance of well-taught breathing exercises cannot be exaggerated. If children are taught to expand the l'ungs regularly so that air reaches every part, these organs are so much the better equipped to resist the organism of tubercle than lungs which are sluggishly exercised. NERVOUS DISEASES. "But few cases of Chorea or Epilepsy were noted. Many of the children were of an unstable nervous system, due in some cases to defects in nutrition ; in others, notably with a history of ' night terrors,' to the presence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids. DEFORMITIES. " Many of these were instances of deformities left by some crippling illness, such as Infantile Paralysis or Rickets; in other eases the deformity was present at birth. The following are the varieties which were observed Infantile Palsy 25 Pigeon Breast 13 Genu Valgum 3 Flat Foot 6 Talipes 2 Scoliosis 9 Kyphosis 20 Torticollis 2 Hare Lip and Clleft Palate 2 Congenital Hip Dislocation 3 94 SPEECH. "There were only 31 cases of stammering found, principally among the older children. A large preponderance of cases was found in boys. The children affected appeared to belong to two classes, those whose home conditions were good but who were highly nervous and excitable, and who suffered in some cases from enlarged tonsils or adenoid growths, and those who were obviously underfed and uncared for. Again it is necessary to point out the importance of well-taught breathing exercises in the education of school children. The cure of stammering, after eliminating any condition which interferes with the nutrition of the child resolves itself first into the teaching of proper control over the muscles concerned in respiration, and the co-ordination of the muscles involved ki speech. The following were the conditions found, which are grouped under "Other Conditions Dyspepsia, 10; Worms, 43; Enuresis, 9; Constipation, 3; Phimosis, 1; Parotid Tumour, 1; Debility, 4; Hypospadias, 1; Facia] Paralysis, 1; Naevus, 3; Prolapsus Ani, 1; Leucorrhœa, 3; Branchial Tumour, 2; Rheumatism, 11; Appendicitis, 1; Thyroid Gland enlarged, 3; Whitlow, 1 ; Nephritis, 1; Herpes, 1." INSPECTION CLINIC AND THE TREATMENT OF MINOR AILMENTS. Each morning on which the Elementary Schools are open an Inspection Clinic is held at the Town Hall, to which children come who are referred to the School Medical Officer by the School Medical Inspector, Head Teachers, or School Visiting Officers. Such children as are not fit to be in school are excluded and kept under observation until it is safe for them to resume attendance at school. In close association with the Inspection Clinic is the Minor Ailments Clinic, in which the treatment of such conditions as discharging ears, sore eyes, ringworm, and simple skin complaints is undertaken. In some instances the parents are instructed how to carry out the treatment at home, and in suitable 95 oases the treatment is effected at the Clinic by the School Nurse under the direction and supervision of the School Medical Officer.

After the lapse of several weeks' exclusion from school, during which time they have been instructed and cautioned, the parents are summoned to attend before the various School Attendance Sub-Committees. The parents of 102 children were thus dealt with and prosecutions instituted in 52 instances. 97 The following are the results of the prosecutions:— 1 fine of 16/- and 4/- costs. 1 fine of 6/- and 4/- costs. 3 fines of 2/6 and 4/- costs. 34 fines of 1/- a.nd 4/- costs. 1 fine of 1/- and 1/6 costs. 1 attendance order with 4/- costs. 1 attendance order, costs remitted. 2 boys committed to North London Truant School owing to verminous condition and neglect. 8 cases adjourned and withdrawn. EYE CLINIC. An Eye Clinic for the examination and treatment of children suffering from defective vision was opened at the Town Hall on April 2nd, and has since been maintained on two mornings in each week of the school terms. The Council has erected a corrugated iron building in the yard adjoining the Public Health Offices, which is used for the Ophthalmic and Dental Clinics. The building measures 27 feet 3 inches by 12 feet and cost £175 0s. 8d. lit contains a dark room for the use of the Oculist and all the apparatus needed for the testing and treatment of children suffering from Ophthalmic and Deintal defects. The waiting room in the Health Department serves for all the clinics, and gives access a,t the south end to the new corrugated iron building. Children discovered in the schools to be suffering from defective vision come up to the clinic by appointment, and are all carefully examined under a cycloplegic by the Oculist, who prescribes glasses where necessary. The Council have entered into a contract with Mr. Seed, of High Road, Leyton, to supply spectacles to prescription, and the cost to the Council v;tries with the complexity of the glasses; 98 nevertheless, a uniform charge of 2s. 6d.. is made to the parents in respect of each pair of spectacles supplied. On his work during the nine months that the clinic has been established, Dr. Cummings writes as follows:— "I have the honour of presenting to you the first report of the Ophthalmic Department. "As usual in new ventures, a certain amount of prejudice was shown by some parents at the suggestion that they should have their children's sight tested; others strongly objected to their children wearing glasses ; others—and these were grandmothers—said they had brought up large families and had never heard of such a thing; but on the whole people seemed grateful for the opportunity of having their children's eyes tested free of charge. " On the part of the smaller children crying was not uncommon at first, latterly they have been quite good. "Since the work commenced in April, 1914, I have seen 327 cases, GO of which did not complete the whole course; of these latter most have left the neighbourhood ; some were ill at the time appointed to attend, and in spite of fresh engagements did not turn up; others, whose parents objected to the idea, did not attend after the first visit. "The subjoined table shows the number and variety of the visual defects. The predominance of astigmatic cases over simple long and short sight is probably due to the fact that the worst cases are picked out and sent to me, and these are usually due to astigmatism. There were seven cases of marked defect in acuteness of vision, in which it was impossible to improve the vision at all in one eye. There were ten cases of actual disease of the eye, in which glasses were useless: such as scars of old Ulcers, Choroiditis, Keratitis, Opacities, and one case of Retinal Detachment by growth or blood clot. The defects of vision in 30 cases of 99 squint were corrected in hope of improvement in the squint. Ten cases came up in which no glasses were given, as no benefit was derived from their use, or as they were not required. In two or three instances prescriptions were given, as the parents preferred to get the glasses privately. In two or three instances glasses had been obtained recently from Ophthalmic Hospitals, and did not require changing. In 236 cases glasses were supplied. Long sight 20 Short sight 25 Long sighted astigmatism 109 Short sighted astigmatism 49 Mixed long and short sighted astigmatism 36 Long sight in one and short sight in the other eye 3 Defective acuteness of vision in one eye 7 Squint 30 Other diseases 12 Cases which did not complete the course 60 Glasses not given 14 Glasses supplied 236 (Signed) Arthur P. Cummings." DENTAL CLINIC. The Council has established a Dental Clinic during the year, this being held at the Town Hall in the same room as is used by the Oculist. It has been found that at least 75 per cent. of all children of school age have their teeth affected with caries. To provide treatment for such a large number would require the services of several dentists and would be an enormous undertaking. Accordingly, it has been recognized that the best way to make a start in this important work is to treat the younger children— those whose permanent teeth are beginning to appear—and, having 100 put their mouth in a healthy condition, to re-inspect them from year to year so that a healthy state may be maintained. The Dentist visits each school in turn and inspects the mouths of all children who are 6 years of age. The parents of those found suffering from dental caries are communicated with, and if they desire treatment at the clinic an appointment is made. The condition of the mouths of all children thus attending the Dental Clinic is recorded on cards and a note made of the treatment carried out. The object of the Dentist is to render the mouth in a healthy condition, which is done by filling all the teeth which can be saved and extracting those which are unsavable; in some cases dressings with silver nitrate are employed. The following tables shew the conditions found and the work performed in connection with one school (Harrow Green), and this will serve as a sample of the whole district:— SIX-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN. Total number of children examined 103 Number of children with sound teeth 11 Percentage of children with carious teeth 89.3 Analysis of Children with Carious Teeth.

Total Number of decayed teeth 424 Number savable 329 Number unsavable 95 In this school the work done included:— Fillings 159 Extractions 51 Dressings 11 This represents an average of about 3 fillings and 1 extraction to each child. The number of children who completed their treatment and whose mouths are now in a healthy condition is 50. Very little trouble was experienced in getting the children to attend for their appointments and in most cases more than one attendance was necessary owing to the amount of work which had to be performed. Some of the children came quite eagerly and looked upon their visit to the clinic as an interesting event in their lives. The clinic was opened in September but the early part of the month was occupied in selecting appliances and instituting a working scheme; inspection and treatment were not begun until the end of the month. The following tables give an analysis of the work performed to the end of the year. There is a tendency on the part of the parents to look upon the clinic as a tooth-pulling institution. Every opportunity is taken to explain that tooth extraction is an incidental part of the scheme and that the main object is to obtain a clean and healthy mouth. 102 Most of the teeth dealt with being of the first dentition are small and can be treated without much pain to the child. In several instances local anaesthetics have been injected into the gum previous to extractions but in only one case has gas been used, this being an older child, not one of the routine cases.

BLIND CHILDREN. Two blind children were maintained at the Council's expense at the East London Home and School for Blind Children at Clapton, but one child left in July, having reached the age of 16 years. 103 DEFECTIVE BLIND CHILDREN. One girl is residing at the Hastings and St. Leonard's Home. DEAF AND DUMB CHILDREN. Nine children are attending the Water Lane Deaf and Dumb Centre, West Ham. One child is at the Royal Asylum, Margate, and one at Gainsborough Road Deaf and Dumb Centre, Walthamstow. TUBERCULOSIS. School children whose condition suggests that they are possibly suffering from tuberculosis are referred by the School Medical Officer to the Tuberculosis Officer for his opinion. Those found to be affected with tuberculosis as a rule attend the dispensary for treatment; others whose condition cannot be determined at the first examination are kept under observation. The following are the particulars of children examined at the Tuberculosis Dispensary:— Cases under Treatment: Children. Tuberculosis of Lungs 56 Tuberculosis of Glands 7 Cases under Observation: Tuberculosis of Lungs 3 Doubtful cases of Tuberculosis 35 Contacts to cases of Tuberculosis 39 Children with no signs of active disease 4 Total 144 THE MENTAL DEFICIENCY ACT, 1913. This Act which came into force on April 1st, 1914, deals with the following classes of persons:— 1. Idiots. 2. Imbeciles. 3. Feeble-minded Persons. 4. Moral Imbeciles. 104 Section 31 provides as follows:— " The duties of a local education authority shall include a duty to make arrangements, subject to the approval of the Board of Education,— (a) for ascertaining what children within their area are defective children within the meaning of this Act; (b) for ascertaining which of such children are incapable by reason of mental defect of receiving benefit or further benefit from instruction in special schools or classes; (c) for notifying to the local authority under this Act, the names and addresses of defective children with respect to whom it is the duty of the local education authority to give notice." In Leyton hitherto no large number of defective children has been dealt with in special schools; most have attended the ordinary elementary schools and those who were subversive of discipline or otherwise unsuitable for association with natural children have been permanently excluded from school. It will sometimes be impossible to state that a given child is incapable of receiving benefit from instruction in a special school if he has never attended any but an elementary school. One result of the Act will be that the Council will have to provide accommodation in special schools for a larger number of defective children than it has done in the past. The Council has adopted the Model Arrangements of the Board of Education, which refer to the following classes of children who are to be notified to the Local Control Authority, that is, to the County Council:— 1. Idiots and Imbeciles. 2. Children incapable by reason of mental defect of receiving benefit from instruction in a special school. 105 3. Children who cannot be instructed in a special school without detriment to the interests of the other children. 4. Children incapable of receiving further benefit from instruction in a special school. 5. Mentally defective children who for special circumstances should be dealt with by way of supervision or guardianship. 6. Children of 10 years of age who are about to be drawn or discharged from a special school. In the majority of the above instances it is necessary for the Council to receive the approval of the Hoard of Education to the notifying of the children to the County Council. EPILEPTIC CHILDREN. One girl is still at Chalfont St. Peter's. One boy has been sent to the Home for Epileptics at Maghull, Liverpool. Children who suffer from Epileptic Fits, not too frequent or too severe, are encouraged to attend ordinary schools. EARLIER CLOSING OF SCHOOLS. The Council decided that from October, 1914, to March, 1915, inclusive, the schools should be opened for the afternoon session a quarter of an hour earlier, viz., 1.45 instead of 2 o'clock, and be closed correspondingly earlier. This arrangement is a useful one and might with advantage be followed in subsequent years. PROVISION OF MEALS. The same arrangements for feeding necessitous children attending the elementary schools as formerly reported are still in existence. I he attempt to estimate the effect of feeding the children by weighing them weekly has not been successful. 106 It was arranged that the children on the feeding lists should present themselves at the Town Hall on Saturday morning to be weighed, but their attendance has been so irregular that no reliable data have been obtained. LEYTON CHILDREN'S COUNTRY HOLIDAY FUND. This Voluntary Fund was started in 1913 by a committee of ladies and gentlemen residing in the district. Its object is to secure for as many of the Leyton School children as its funds will allow a short holiday in the country or seaside. The Chairman of the Fund is Mr. Councillor Read, a member of the Education Committee, and his wife, Mrs. Read, is the hon. secretary. As will be seen by the following remarks from the second Annual Report, the Fund continued its beneficent work although this was somewhat curtailed by the outbreak of the war. It is to be hoped that subscriptions will be forthcoming so that at least the work can be maintained even if not extended during the present crisis. "Batches of girls, numbering 85, were sent away to Canvey Island on June 5th and 19th, where they had a most enjoyable time, and their improved appearance on returning was in itself a justification of the work of the Fund. "On July 26th, 54 boys enjoyed a fortnight's holiday by the aid of the Fund. Of this number 12 joined the Camp of the 2nd Leyton Troop of Boy Scouts, at Heme Bay, by the kindness of Scoutmaster Lewis Thomas. Unfortunately the breaking out of hostilities prevented the second batch of 38 boys being sent away, but the Commitee decided that these lads should be given the preference next year. 107 "The arrangements were all carried out satisfactorily, and in every case good reports were received of the homes to which the children were sent. "It is earnestly hoped that many more subscribers will be added to the list, and that next year the Committee will be enabled to greatly extend its sphere of influence. "Those who give will be glad to know that practically the whole of the money goes direct to the object of the givers. All the work done is voluntary, and apart from the board and lodging of the children and the railway fares, the only outgoings are the necessary expenses of postage, printing and stationery. Great care is taken in seeing that only suitable cases are helped." MORI-: SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION. High Road School (Re-building). The Council has authorised the necessary proceedings to be taken for a Provisional Order to be obtained for the purpose of acquiring this property, also other land adjoining. Canterbury Road School. Plans for the completion of this school, by the erection of an additional block of buildings for senior boys and senior girls, and the construction of a Double Domestic Centre for Cookery and Laundry work have been submitted to the Board of Education for approval. Improvements effected in the Schools during the year. The external parts of the following schools were painted during the summer vacation:— Sybourne Street (temporary school). Farmer Road. 108 Interiors painted (the last two being done in the Christmas vacation):— Capworth Street. Downsell Road. Ruckholt Road. Harrow Green. Davies Lane. The latrines belonging to all the schools in the district were cleansed, lime-whited and overhauled during the Easter vacation. Cleansing and flushing of drains was carried out during the Easter, Whitsun and Summer holidays. The gas fittings at the several schools were examined before the commencement of the winter season, also at Christmas. The suggestion contained in the Report of last year as to the necessity for the school windows being cleaned between the Summer and Christmas vacations, in addition to the four annual cleanings they now receive, has not been acted upon. I wash to again bring this matter under the notice of the committee. The ordinary mica flaps provided to the drain air-inlets being continually reported by the Sanitary Inspectors to be out of order, frequently through the mischievous interference of the scholars, the use of Barker's patent air-inlets, which cannot be thus interfered with, was suggested. The committee have in consequence instructed the architect in future to replace any defective air-inlets by ones of this pattern. Improvements at Individual Schools. Cann Hall Road School. 1.
