Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1870—71. 3 Parish of Saint George the Martur Southwork. ANNUAL REPORT MADE TO THE VESTRY by the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1871. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, It is now my duty to place before you the Annual Report of the sanitary and, as far as comes within the sphere of ray duties, the social condition of the District which you represent. I venture to ask your special attention to this Report, because it sums up, to a certain extent, the results of the duties and responsibilities which vestrymen undertook in 1856, after the passing of the Metropolis Management Act. And as a great change in the government of the Metropolis is now impending, the present seems an opportune time for making a brief statement of what vestries have accomplished. The demand for this change of Metropolitan Government made by many who possess no knowledge of what had to be | done when vestries were established, nor of what has been done since through their agency, has led to many prejudicial attacks upon them. Of late the newspapers have been fully occupied in giving us foreign war news of no light importance; meanwhile vestries have enjoyed the blessings of peace; otherwise it appears that when exciting topics are scarce, the command goes forth," Attack the Vestries." Whatever of imperfection cropped up in this "great and wide City; "whether the removal of that imperfection fell within or without the compass of their duties mattered little, upon hem fell the lash. They have been accused of ignorance, negligence, and selfishness. My experience tells me, that often a far larger amount of ignorance has been manifested by the ???users than by the accused. It is quite probable, nay, it is quite true, that vestries have laid themselves open to the blame of negligence and selfishness; but thus far, I have ???er yet met with any body of men whatsoever, who have not deserved the same blame; 4 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southwarlc. and I do not hope yet to meet with such a body of men. There is, therefore, no rea.so why vestries should thus be particularised. A man may sit in his closet, and map out the clearest and plainest of theories; a theory that would meet every case, and satisfy the varied needs of humanity. But how altered becomes this beautiful woven design, when endeavours are made to carry it out into practice; it is speedily rent into shreds and patches, and only fit for the rag-bag. And it is an unfortunate event for many, that their theories never are tested, for they go on through life and to death, believing in their panacea, and abusing and wondering at mankind for not adopting it. Ideals can never be carried out into practice: indeed we may derive much comfort, if we can only make some due approximation to them. The work of man "must not be measured by the scale of perfection." The work done is limited; that which is required to be done is unlimited. The good that has been accomplished is accepted and forgotten; the failures remain, and are not forgotten. But these failures are frequently but the evidence of the unwise expectations of sanguine men. The progress which has been made, has been greatly undervalued and underrated. All change, if it is to prove beneficial, must be gradually brought about. The lightning and the earthquake are sudden, but destructive and terrifying. How much is forgotten of our sanitary condition, when Vestries began their mighty task. They had to contend against evils and prejudices, which had their origin, in far away back generations, and which have cast down their roots deep and intricate into our social system. No body of men can prove abiding; they must necessarily be succeeded by other bodies, possessed with fresh designs, hopes, and energies: time itself, the chiefest of innovators, bringing this about. This law of change, however, affords no reason why abuse should have been so freely lavished on men, who, for the most part, have honestly, zealously, and voluntarily done the work which was given them to do. To a certain extent, the statement of a popular essayist is true:— "that the sanitary reformer must make up his mind to see no fruit of his labours, much less thanks or rewards. He must die in faith, as St. Paul says all true men die, "not having received the promises." I may be allowed here, then, to bring before you in as short a space as possible, some of the works which have been carried out by you, and especially those which have come under my own division of duty. The Metropolis Management Act was passed in 1855, and you commenced your duties in 1856. Then sanitary writers and workers were laughed and sneered at, and looked upon as a sort of monomaniacs. People had been born, had grown up to manhood, and had reached a good old age. During that life, great deeds had been accomplished: works written that shall remain co-extensive with the language : footprintS| had been left by them on every land: and what more could possibly be done or required under any changes'? An Alderman then, since a Lord Mayor, and now a Member c Parliament, could and did make use of the following words:— "The fact was, that the sanitary schemes were got up; talk was made about Cholera, and people became alar??? Now, it was said that burial grounds were highly injurious to health, and a great ??? been raised against them. He did not know such to be the fact, that they were in ??? to health. He did not believe one word about it. There were many persons who ??? raising up bugbears of this description in the present day, and those persons were always Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1870—71. 5 raising up some crotchet or another." Such was then the opinion held of Sanitary Reformers, and by a Eepresentative Man ! The Acts under which Vestries had to work were very imperfect, giving forth uncertain readings, so that no clear decision could be reached. Opposition was strong on every hand; the magistrates sympathised with the defendants. Property and its rights were apparently invaded; and property and its rights have always claimed more support than property and its duties. All was new and disturbing, and the results were not yet apparent. An Act containing the most beneficial designs, must injure some one when put into operation. Time must pass, experience must increase, and fruit must be gathered, before it will be accepted and appreciated. The simple notice of an Inspector now, will bring about what a summons and visit to the Police Court could not then. Such, at that period, was the state of public opinion, and the provision of the Law. And what was our physical condition? In every yard were one or more of what Dr. Arnott truly called "the foulest receptacles in nature," namely, cesspools; these gave off unceasingly foul effluvia, filling meat-safe, cupboard, passage and room. The smell met you on entering the house, abode with you whilst you remained in it, and came out with you on leaving it. The Parish was burrowed with them, and the soil soddened with the escape of their contents. The emptying them proved a true infliction. They have now been emptied for the last time, filled up with coarse disinfecting materials, and water closets substituted for them. A change so great and advantageous, should claim the hearty acknowledgement of every man and woman, who values health, comfort, and cleanliness. They would not now be endured for a moment; yet with what difficulty were they abolished. They were clung to, as if some old and honoured relic was about to be ruthlessly torn from its possessors. No man may compute the extent of disease, and the number of deaths, that took their origin from them, in the air above and in the earth beneath. Indirectly connected with these, I would next mention the pumps that stood here and there, inviting the thirsty and those whose water supply was deficient, and the name of the latter was legion; for water was given only three times in the week, and for a very short space of time. The water which filled these shallow wells, came from the surface of the roads, from cess-pools, and slaughter-houses; from church-yards and other impure sources. The walls of these wells had fallen into ruins; and were covered with a ropy slimy layer of substance, offensive to smell and touch; whilst the water was considered to be cool, pure, and delicious. The removal of these slaughterwells was looked upon as a wrong done to the poor, yet cholera dwelt in them ; and to them many a mound was raised. The roads are now more frequently and carefully swept, and the refuse more speedily removod: and when we consider the composition of this refuse, and the extent to which it was carried by wind and traffic, we may look upon this improvement as no slight boon. Pigs were wont to haunt our streets and roads in search of food, of the most loathsome disgusting kind. Any one who could afford to keep a pig did so, to his own injury ???at of his neighbour. Their condition and surroundings were filthy, as negligence and ???f convenience could make them. There were also public sties in which from ten to ???igs were huddled together, and the smell from which the winds carried far and wide. ??? abolish these required a great effort, and which has only just been crowned with final ???cess. 6 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

The lowest and highest number of deaths that occurred in one week strangely followed one another, being the seventh and eighth of 1871, the numbers were 12 and 44. TABLE No. 2. SUB-DISTRICTS.

In each of the sub-districts there has been a decrease in the death rate. In the Borough-road sub-district in place of 36 deaths in 1000 persons living, there have only been 28, or one in thirty-five; in the Kent-road sub-district there have been 24 in place of 26, or one in forty-two; and in London-road sub-district 24 in place of 25, or one in forty-one. Kent-road sub-district has been the most healthy; and the Borough-road, as usual, the most unhealthy. This decrease the census may show, in owing to the decrease of population from the destruction of houses for railways and new streets. TABLE No. 3. 1866-7 1867-8 1868-9 1869-70 1870-1 BIRTHS. DEATHS.

The germs of these diseases may be carried about by persons, or sent in clothing apparel to great distances, examples of which are plentiful. They will cling to walls and furniture, and start up with fatal vigour, after they have lain hidden and dormant for months. They may find a soil or a grave in the person who receives them, the result depending mainly upon the health of that person. Insufficiency of food, is probably the greatest agent in preparing suitable victims, and it is one, unfortunately, ever in operation. The diseases produced by these germs not only cause present sickness and death, but they permanently damage the constitution of the sufferer, and the state of health enjoyed before the attack will hardly ever be regained. But even here the end is not reached : the shattered constitution is propagated to those yet unborn; the circle of evil widens and widens, until that portion of our race becomes extinct. The first of these diseases that will claim our attention is small-pox, which for some months has proved a cause of fear and a demand for vaccination unknown to the present generation. The near approach of that foul and loathsome disease, soon put to flight the illy theories, the vanities, and affectations of those who had been boldly and unceasingly hurling their anathemas against vaccination. We have not been visited by such an epidemic of small-pox since the registration of deaths commenced, now thirty one years ago. During the course of these years there have been nine epidemics, which have 10 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. sioned 25,071 deaths; giving a weekly average of sixteen. The highest mortality that occurred in one week was 102, and that was the last week of 1840. In the eighteenth week of this year, the mortality reached 288. The epidemic has been present during the whole of 1870, and the two last months of 1869. According to the Medical Report of the Small-pox Hospital it commenced in November of that year. In the year 1870, there were admitted 1285 cases of small-pox : of these 963 had been vaccinated, and 322 had not been vaccinated. Out of the 963 vaccinated cases 76 died, giving a mortality of about 8 in 100. Out of the 322 unvaccinated cases 124 died, giving a mortality of near 39 in 100. The Reporters say that, "not a single fact has occurred within our experience at the Hospital during the past year to shake our confidence in vaccination when properly performed, or to detract in any degree from that high estimate of its value which many years' experience in the wards of the Hospital, and a close study of small-pox have led us to form." At the Hampstead Hospital, from December 1st, 1870, to February 18th, 1871, 800 cases came under the notice of the Medical Attendants: of these 591 had been vaccinated, the remaining 209 had not. Indeed, many of those vaccinated had been imperfectly done. Of the vaccinated nearly 9 per cent. died; of the 209 not vaccinated 45 per cent. The mortality in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated was more severe during the later months. Vaccination is a great preventive of small-pox; and in those cases where the disease does come, it is rendered much more mild and manageable. Utterly to stamp out this disease, vaccination should be universally practised; it should be performed during the early months of life, and with the greatest care, both as regards the material and the operation. To show what small-pox is, where vaccination has never been practised, I quote from Advices sent from Fort Garry, dated October, 1870, which tells us that it was committing fearful ravages; that the Indians were dying by thousands, and that the plains were covered with painted corpses, the stench from which was dreadful. The Government contemplated sending out Vaccinators (British Medical Journal ). A serious outbreak of this disease happened in one of our large Hospitals. It was propagated through the medium of the Laundry. Disinfection of the linen and revaccinution immediately stayed the disease. All fear of contagion by such means might at once be allayed, by having the articles placed for awhile in a drying stove. I present you with a Table which represents the deaths that have happened from small-pox in London and in this District during the last fourteen years. TABLE No. 5. LONDON.

Only virgin lymph should be employed. The failures of vaccination have their origin from the way in which it has been carried out. I shall make no remarks upon the remainder of the diseases that come under the zymotic class, more than to call your attention to the difference between the mortality caused by scarlet fever in the year 1869-70, and in that of the year just ended. In the former there were registered 152 deaths ; in the latter 65. Cholera caused thirteen deaths; two of which occurred in Southwark Bridge Eoad and in St. George's Road, and one in each of the following,—Spiller's Court, Red Cross Court, Elliott's Row, Mint Street, Friar Street, Walker Street, Duke Street, Tower Street and Waterloo Road. I know of no better opportunity than the present, of considering the part Milk plays in the spread of zymotic diseases. The Vestry has wisely opposed the opening of new Cowsheds in this district; feeling the utter inconsistency of such permission with promotion of sanitary improvements. The overcrowding of human beings is an evil of too pressing magnitude, to allow of an increase being made by the addition of cattle. But, besides this, there is another important cause for reflection, and that is, the nature of the milk got from Cows so placed. Analyses have shown that where Distillers' wash is given for food, the quantity of the milk is increased, but at the expense of its quality. The seller is benefited ; the buyer is injured. In every respect Country milk is superior to Town milk. The butter made from Town milk is quite of an inferior character. It would be most unreasonable to expect that Cows kept in so unnatural a condition, and so improperly fed, could supply good milk. New milk forms a great part of the food of infants and young children, hence of what vital importance it is for the coming generation that the milk be genuine. It is difficult to say how far milk obtained from diseased Cows is injurious when used for food ; but a little while ago in Dorsetshire, a number of pigs died from being fed with milk from cows suffering from Foot-and-Mouth disease. How many infants have perished from the same cause is a question we may fairly ask; only with no hope of answer. Proofs have lately come to light, that contagious diseases have been propagated by milk. The cause of a number of cases of scarlet fever that happened at Penrith, was traced to this article of food. The disease commenced in the small unventilated house of a milkman, and reappeared in those families who were supplied with this milk. It is supposed the milk absorbed the germs of the poison. But further, an outbreak of typhoid fever took place at Islington, which was confined to families supplied with milk from one Dairy, and more especially to those of the families consuming the milk. The most rigid and careful 12 Parish of Saint George the Martyr, Southward. examination was made into this case, when the fact came out, that an underground water tank had a communication with the drains which had been made by rats, and consequently the water was contaminated with sewage. It was asserted however, that the water was used only for washing the cans and utensils connected with the business. An explanation may be found perhaps in an amusing instance related by the Lancet;—A can, delivered to a large buyer in the north of London, was being emptied of its milk, when a fish in the lull vigour of life and activity came tumbling out. Cases of diarrhoea and cholera have arisen in the most unexpected places, and to individuals placed precisely as many others with the exception of diet. These cases stood as abiding difficulties to every theory concerning these diseases, that could be entertained. For instance, during the last cholera epidemic, some isolated cases occurred in Montjoy Prison, Dublin, the sufferers had been no more exposed than others similarly situated ; in fact they had not been exposed at all. It was found, however, that the milk which they had used as food, was adulterated from a quarter to half its quantity with water from the city pumps, "The foulest supply ever offered to humanity." Other cases of a like character have been reported from time to time, taking their origin from the same cause. There is a decrease in the deaths of children from scrofulous diseases; which if permanent, will show an improvement in the race. There is also a decrease of deaths from diseases of the Brain and Nerves. For many years they have been slowly on tho increase. Forty-five deaths were attributed to premature birth and debility. Fifteen infants, their ages ranging from eight days to eight months, were accidentally suffocated. A male, aged 37 was killed by a train, whilst crossing the line of railway: another aged 54, was kuockcd down by a carriage, and ruptured his bowels. A female, aged 41, fell with he'' head against a piece of iron. A male, aged 62, and a female aged 42, hung themselves. A male, aged 48, cut his bowels open. Two males, one aged 42, and the other 40, cut their throats. A female aged 42, was killed by being dragged violently down stairs.

Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1870—71. 13 The condition and the supply of the water we consume, has for some time past claimed esnecial attention, and the prospect of obtaining suitable water becomes more hopeful. Nothing could have equalled the equanimity and patience so long shown during our supply of "the filthiest stuff ever drunk by a civilised community; being brackish with the influence of each tide, and contaminated with the outscourings of the metropolis, swarming with infusorial life, and containing unmistakeable molecules of excrement (Simon)". Yet at the very time this was the case, the Directors declared the water to be "unexceptionably good and the Chairman from his seat of authority asserted, that a supply from the Thames at Battersea, was inferior in no appreciable degree to the stream in any part of its course. And the demand for change he stigmatised as "a wholly uncalled for expenditure of capital." And worse still, eminent Chemists were found, who gave it as their opinion that the water was not noxious to health. Long after this Dr. Ackland of Oxford said, that to him "it was a standing miracle, that the Londoners did not rise up in arms against the Provincials, for remorselessly pouring their sewage down upon some of their Water Companies." "Water is more necessary to our existence than solid food, and in this point of view holds an intermediate rank between air and solid food, being less essential than the first, but more so than the last." I need not say that the water supplied is much improved to what it was a few years ago. It contains much less of "organic nitrogen;" but there still abound in it living productions, which are supposed to be the causes of disease. Danger exists to the consumer as long as theso are met with in the water consumed. If impure water be passed through a sufficient depth of earth it will come up purified; all the suspended matters, as well as the organisms, will have been separated or destroyed, and will have served the useful purpose of giving food to the vegetable kingdom. Dr. Pranklaud does not think the Thames water suitable for the supply of the Metropolis. But he resignedly says that "the majority of us are doomed to drink Thames water for many years to come although the chalk, oolite, and green sand foundations around London, contain abundance of water which is of unsurpassed purity. Prom these sources of cool, colourless, refreshing, and perfectly safe water, he hopes one day that this vast city will be entirely supplied. He states that there is plenty to supply London, did it contain double the number of its present inhabitants. TABLE No. 8. 1870—1.

This Table is suggestive, and will give rise to various thoughts, according to the view taken of it. .1 a it are to be met with the names of the worst localities in our Parish; localities in which disease, crime, and immorality run riot. Shortly we shall have the opportunity of making the contrast between life spent there, and life spent in Peabody's Buildings now in course of erection in Blackfriars Road. Shall we have these buildings, as regards disease and death, like as are Duke Street, Mint Street, Friar Street, Lansdowne Place, and similar localities; or will they stand out like some tall beacon, to warn and to guide? Houses so built, we are told, will not pay ; and no speculative builders have yet been met with who will work upon that principle. Nevertheless, the builders will come, and such houses will be built; but the time is yet afar off. We do, however, require a new Building Act; for the evils from which we mow suffer are being daily perpetuated. I have often asked myself, to what use have the bricks taken up from the old sewers been applied ? Bricks absorb powerfully and extensively emanations of every kind. A single brick will suck up a pint of water. When the walls of Hospitals have been left uncleansed for a long time, the workmen have„ suffered, and sometimes severely. If these bricks have been used for house building purposes, many will be the hapless sufferers. They will be always ill and complaining, and knowing not to what cause to attribute their illness. I may add here that a great amount of ill-health follows the occupation of houses newly built. Hardly is a house finished before there are blinds in the windows, smoke coming out of the chimneys, and every sign of domestic life proceeding therein. The passing of the Education Bill will exercise vast influence upon the Parish for good. A step has been taken in the right direction, but we may easily imagine that the stride made, has been greater than it really is. Our anticipations must be kept well within the bounds of sobriety. The greatest writer of the day has said, "There are unhappy times in the world's history, when he that is least educated will chiefly have to say that he is least perverted." How much then will depend upon the education given, and the example shown. The mind cannot be improved, if care for the body is left out of consideration. The first effort to improve the moral condition of a hungry dirty child, would be to wash and feed it. Confidence and comfort would thereby be gained. The late Sir Charles Bell said in 1839, "There has been in my day a good deal said about education, but they appear to me to put out of sight example, which is all in all." New measures are passed and we are in high glee, thinking of the good that will be brought about by them. Such glee is often of short duration, and mostly ends in sadness. A Scotch minister in 1842 tells us that he visited some of the mercantile towns in England with a view of making a comparison between the dwellings of the labouring classes there, and of the labouring classes in Dundee. He passed through Glasgow and Edinburgh on his way home; and he came to the conclusion that the Scottish towns had reached a depth of physical degradation far lower than that of the worst of English towns. "Whatever therefore," he exclaims, "be the superiority of our working population in intellectual education, are we in our pride of intellect, to shut our eyes to the deplorable fact, that this educational superiority has proved wholly unable to prevent the masses in our towns from sinking into a physical barbarism, in house and person, which to the most ignorant and wretched Norwich weaver, would be intolerable." A mere education of the intellect will never avail in bringing about that which the Bill intended. We need an education of the moral powers, and culture of the affections, 16 Pariah of St. George the Martyr, Southward. whereby may follow as a 'sure result, decent homes, and happy fire-sides. We want a teaching of the right and free use of brush and besom, and of the necessity of domestic and personal cleanliness. We are constantly blaming and trying to cure the effect, paying no attention to the cause. Our tendency is to make man good from without to within; by hedging up his path that he cannot stray, whilst folly and passion may revel uncurbed within, and the more so by reason of the external restraint. We would make a mechanical good man. All real progress must be individual and from within. How often it happens to us, that in a block of mean decayed wretched-looking houses, we come upon one standing out quite distinct from the rest; everything outside appearing orderly and clean everything inside peaceful and comfortable. Yet, there are the same opportunities for the exercise of the passions, the same temptations, and the same tendency to idleness and untidy habits. From whence comes this remarkable contrast? Not from external measure It is said of the Irish, that when admitted into suitable dwellings, they speedily become dirty and dilapidated. This characteristic unfortunately is not confined to the Irish. Many a kind and thoughtful landlord has thus been thwarted and disappointed in his hopes and designs. Landlords are not all bad, neither are tenants all good. One helps to improve or demoralise the other. We seem nearing a crisis. There are all the signs of a coming change. Mens' minds are unsettled and upon the watch. We are gliding on to new thoughts, new ways, new deeds. As man waxes in years, so does his experience enlarge, and his wisdom increase. If such is the case with the individual, must it not also be the case with the whole ? A. higher and wider type of belief is needed. A belief that shall fully and reverently recognise, the great laws of health which regulate the whole man, and which form a part of the Will and Moral Government of Providence, equally with those that have specially been revealed, and which must be received as equally obligatory. From neglect of this, the world has been deluded with cruelties, crime, and vice. No mind can act justly in a diseased body for "distempered nerves infect the thoughts; the langour of the frame depresses the soul's vigour". The future, however, presents good ground for hope, and hope has the beneficial tendency of "putting us into a working mood." A writer speaking about that which he knows, thus prophesies:—"For man there remains a higher and more perfect symmetry and beauty, as the result of a healthy and well governed body, and refined by the highest intellectual faculties, a continued advancement and improvement of his mental constitution, till the world shall again be inhabited by a single nearly homogeneous race, no individual of which shall be inferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity (Wallace, B & F.
