METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT 43, White Horse Road, Commercial Road, E.l. To The Mayor, Aldenrmon and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Your Worship, Ladies & Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my report for the year 1948. The report is again abridged in accordance with the direction of the Ministry of Health. The last estimate of the population of the Borough is 100,020. The total live births In 1948 show a slight decrease, 2129 compared with 2184 last year, giving a live birth rate of 21.2 for 1948 tornpared with 21.8 for. 1947. The infant mortality rate continues to drop - 51.2 in 1946, 37.5 in 1947 and 27.7 this year. The latter figure is the lowest recorded infant mortality rate in the history of the Borough and compares most favourably with rates in boroughs of better environment (see graph on page (x)). Perhaps it would not be unjustifiable to take this low rate as being in part at least due to the Borough Council's successful administration of the Maternity and Child Welfare services - a matter which I think it is only fair to comment upon in this year's report when these services are being handed over to the County Health Authority under the National Health Service Act of 1946. Whatever the justification may be for taking the Maternity and Child Welfare Services away from the local administration of the Metropolitan Borough Councils in London, it cannot be said that it was because of any failure of the local system. The infant mortality of 27.7 is undoubtedly low but the Borough Council had hoped to reduce still further these rates by opening a residential nursery for the care of premature infants at the new Mary Hughes Centre in Underwood Road, However the introduction of the new Act and the consequent transfers of functions intervened. No doubt, in due course suitable provision will be made in some part of the plan of the Regional Hospital Board. A small local unit for premature infants in Stepney in very close contact with the mothers of the infants concerned which was envisaged in the Underwood Road scheme would' perhaps be preferable. It is good to be able to record that the maternal mortality rate per 1000 live and still births has again reached zero as in 1944, The figures for the last few years were 1.8, 0.8 and now 0.0. One hopes that this can be attributed in a considerable degree to the mothers themselves - that they are better fed and educated and more (i) knowledgable in self-care during the pre-natal period, that they appreciate more the value.of vitamins and correct diet in pregnancy, that the excellent scheme of propaganda in pre-natal diet conducted by the Ministry of Food in the press and cinema has taken effect and that the latest generation of grandmothers are passing on sound and up-to-date advice. Deaths from the notifiable infectious diseases were extremely low this year, and apart from pneumonia and tuberculosis there was only one death i.e. from cerebrospinal-fever. There were no deaths from diphtheria of which there were 36 notified cases (53 last year). There were 774 cases of measles arid 203 of whooping-cough with no deaths. There were only two cases of poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis), with no permanent paralyses and no deaths, and one case of enteric (paratyphoid-B) which recovered. Eighteen cases of dysentery were notified (8 last year). The number of notified cases of tuberculosis decreased from 215 last year to 189, with 99 deaths last year and 71 in the year under review. Formal scabies notifications were reduced, from 415 in 1947 to 156 this year. There were no caSes of smallpox in the Borough. With the coming into operation of the National Health Service Act on 5th July this year the Maternity and Child Welfare. Services with the staff and Health Visitors passed from the Borough Council to the control of the London County Council as the Local Health Authority for the personal health services. Diphtheria immunisation, whooping-cough immunisation and routine vaccination against smallpox will now also be under the London County Council though the Borough Medical Officer of Health still rotain3 powers of vaccination under the Public Health (Smallpox) Regulations, 1917. Under the National Assistance Act 1948 the Borough Council has taken over from the London County Council the burial of those persons who die without any suitable alternative provision having been made for burial. Such of the above persons who die in hospital, however, will now bo buried by the Regional Hospital Board, and those who die in welfare homes (lately Public Assistance Institutions) will continue to be buried by the London County Council. Much of the Tuberculosis 'administration has passed to the Regional Hospital Board of the Ministry of Health. The tuberculosis notification registers, measures for the prevention of tuberculosis, supervision of the environment of tuberculous persons etc., remain with the Borough Medical Officer of Health but the Tuberculosis Dispensary service together With most of the staff including the Tuberculosis Officers have passed to the Regional Board. 'The Tuberculosis Health Visitors will now be under the control of the London County Council with the exception of their duties as clinic-nurses at the tuberculosis dispensary which work will be under the supervision of the Regional Board. The Tuberculosis Care Committee and the duties concerned therewith, pass to the London County Council, and a briof review of the growth of the Tuberculosis Dispensary. Service is appropriate at this time of. change and of transfer of responsibility. (ii) In 1907 tuberculosis was more prevalent in Stepney than in any other part of London and it was in this year that the Jewish Board of Guardians appointed 2 Tuberculosis Visitors to visit patients suffering from phthisis. In 1911 a Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption was opened at 4, Arbour Square. In 1912 two further Dispensaries were opened at 208, High Street, Shadwell and at 18, Great Prescot Street. The Stepney Borough Council took over all 3 voluntary Tuberculosis Dispensaries together with their staffs in 1921 and in 1924 the Tuberculosis Officers were appointed to the Poor Law Hospitals for consultative purposes. Between 1927 and 1929 a handicraft class was begun at 208, High Street, Shadwell in connection with the Dispensary and an L.C.C. openair school was opened at the rear of 35 Stepney Green which premises at that time functioned also as a Tuberculosis Dispensary. It was in October 1935 that the present Tuberculosis Dispensary at Steel's Lane was opened. This is a modern building which was designed specially for the purpose of tuberculosis detection and supervision of patients and it has a well equipped laboratory in addition to consulting rooms and waiting rooms. It serves the whole of the Borough and it is this Dispensary together with the staff which have now passed into other hands. The success of the tuberculosis scheme is indicated by the decline in deaths from phthisis-from 624 in 1901 to 68 in 1948. With tho termination of the Borough Council's Statutory powers in the administration of the Maternity and Child Welfare services, it is also interesting to look back and to survey the development of Maternity and Child Welfare and the work of the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee since its inception on 26th March 1919. The Maternity and. Child Welfare Act of 1918 gave full powers to Local Authorities to establish and develop Maternity and Infant Welfare Centres, but long before that individual boroughs and voluntary bodies had given attention to the care of mothers and babies. From early times France had taken measures for the protection of infant life. The earliest efforts were made for the care of orphans and abandoned infants, and a hospital for sick children was opened in Paris in 1802. Creches were opened in France in 1844 to enable married women with young children to accept employment in factories. Dr.Pierre Budin opened the first Infant Welfare Centre at the Charite Hospital in Paris in 1892, a model for all future infant welfare centres. Mothers brought their babies for inspection and. weighing and advice was given on care and feeding. Soon many other centres were opened in Paris and the provinces. The need for pure milk centres became apparent and the first was opened in Fecamp. In London, the Foundling Hospital was established by Chapter in 1739 in Hatton Garden-in 1748 Dr.William Cadogan a visiting physician urging breast feeding and proper clothing for infants, etc. With the "Dispensary for the Relief of the Infant Poor" in Red Lion (iii) Square in 1769 these were the first Infant Welfare institutions in England. Dr.Brunnell of the new Dispensary in 1816 was already advocating the "home visiting of infants," In 1852 the Hospital for Sick Children.- Great Ormond Street, was founded. The first milk centres in England were opened in St..Helens, Lancashire, in 1899. Sterilised and suitably modified milk was Supplied. In 1901 Infant Welfare Centres were opened in. Liverpool by Dr. E. W. Hope, the Medical Officer of Health, to which Health Visitors were attached. In 1905, home visiting of infants by Corporation Visitors in Glasgow was commenced. In 1906, Huddersfield Corporation obtained parliamentary powers for the compulsory notification of births in the Borough, and this let to the Notification of Births Act, 1907, an adoptive act, made compulsory in 1915. In 1902 the Midwives Act was passed, leading to other acts, until the 1936 Midwives Act established a full-time domiciliary midwifery service. The Education Act of 1907 established the systematic medical inspection of school-children, and experience in working this Act soon showed that regular medical inspection of children prior to school age was necessary. Dr. D.L. Thomas, the Medical Officer of Health to the Limehouse District Board, and afterwards in 1901 to the Stepney Borough Council, was not behind in realising the necessity for infant care in Stepney. The infant mortality of Limehouse (though not of Stepney as a whole) was then the highest in London. In 1900 he urged the District Board to appoint 2 Health Visitors to visit and instruct mothers in the care and feeding of their infants. It was intended that these women would have the status of sanitary inspectors, so as to secure a grant from the Local Government Board towards the payment of their salaries. The Local Government Board refused to give a grant and the scheme fell through. Arrangements were then made to distribute leaflets of advice on infant care to the mothers in the Limehouse area. Had the Board appointed Health Visitors they would have been the first municipal health visitors in London. However, in Stepney much welfare work was being done by voluntary associations. One of the earliest was started by-Mrs. Alice Model, who founded the Jewish Sick Room Help Society in 1895, which was allied to the Jewish Maternity Hospital in Underwood Road and the Infant Welfare Centre subsequently attached thereto. Mrs. Model spent an active life devoted to Infant Welfare, until her death last year. The Jewish Maternity Hospital is now known as the Boarsted Memorial Hospital and has new premises in Lordship Road, Stoke Newington. In 1902 the Public Health Committee of the Stepney Borough Council considered a report from Dr. Thomas advising the appointment of two female Health Visitors, to be appointed in the first instance for 2 years, at a salary of Â£100 a year. Their suggested duties included: (iv) (1) To visit the homes of the-poor and give advice on matters of Home Hygiene including proper clothing and feeding of infants. (2) To visit houses in the district where diarrhoea, measles and whooping cough were prevalent, and instruct the relatives as to the necessity of isolation and proper care of the sick. The ladies to be appointed were to be trained nurses of tact and education who should wear uniforms, and one of whom should be able to speak Yiddish. The Public Health Committee recommended the appointments to the Council, but the Council rejected the scheme by 29 votes to 17. Following this failure, a "well-known nobleman" associated with an outside society offered to pay the salary of a Health Visitor for the Limehouse district for 2 years, and the Committee were thus enabled to appoint a Miss Forrester, who worked in Limehouse for two or three years and then was transferred to another district in Stepney for two years. She commenced her duties on 1st October 1903. Dr. Thomas records that her efforts were apparently successful and that the infant mortality rate of Limahouse was lowered during hor period of office. In October 1906 the Women's Industrial Council approached the Council to appoint a health visitor, and in 1907 a deputation from the Stepney Visitors Association came before the Council urging the appointment of a visitor who should be a woman Sanitary Inspector. A subcommittee approved the proposal for a woman "Sanitary Inspector and Health Visitor" for a period of-twelve months, but the full Health Committee could not see its way to agree. In March 1908 a deputation from the Stepney Council of Public Welfare, including the Bishop of Stepney, addressed the. Council and made a similar request, which was however not passed by the Council. Dr.Thomas, in his report of 1908, commenting upon this matter, observed that most districts with a population of over 100,000 had already appointed a woman sanitary inspector; that 22 Metropolitan Boroughs had appointed between them 39 female sanitary inspectors, and only six remained to do so. These women sanitary inspectors did some of the work now done by Health Visitors. However, the Council may have considered that much work was already being done by voluntary associations in Stepney. The Notification of Births Act, 1907, gave power to Local Authorities to appoint Health Visitors, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, strengthened these powers in London, enabling the Borough Council to pay for the Health Visitor's salary. The Borough Council on 28th July 1909 adopted the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and the Act came into force in the Borough on 8th September 1909. The Borough Council then appointed its first Municipal Health Visitor, who commenced duties on 1st February 1910. This lady wa3 the late Miss Virtue who remained in the service of the Council until her death in November 1931. Meantime much voluntary effort was being made for maternity and child welfare in the Borough. In 1908 the Stepney Infant Welfare Centre and School for Mothers (v) commenced at 587, Commercial Road.E. It was the second infant welfare centre to be opened in London. This Infant Welfare, and School for Mothers continued to operate until taken over by the Borough Council in 1946. In 1911, the Centre held a clinic every Tuesday with two medical men in attendance, and there were also classes in sewing, cooking, and home nursing. During the 1914-18 war the Centre assisted in evacuating mothers and babies to the country and in 1917 the Board of Education nado a grant which was continued in the post-war years by the Ministry of Health for the expansion of the service. There was considerable co-operation between the Health Committee and the voluntary Infant Welfare Centres and the Council's Health Visitor worked in association with the voluntary Health Visitor of the Stepney School for Mothers and between them they thus covered Limehouse, Ratcliffe and Shadwell. Attached to the centre there was a small residential nursery for backward infants, which closed at the beginning of the war and has been greatly missed. In 1909 there were the following voluntary Creches (Day Nurseries) in Stepney: Dr.Barnardo's (Marie Hilton) Creche, 50 children; Jewish Nursery at New Road, 35-50 children; George Yard Centre, 18-20 children, and 154, St. George's St root, 10-18 children. The St. Paul's Day Nursery, Wellclose Square, the only one of these Day Nurseries which is still operating in the Borough, was then taking 18-20 children. Sister Dorothy Reilly, the present devoted matron, has been in charge for 22 years. About 1912 the body known as the St.George's and Wapping Infant Care Committee had infant consultation centres at nine different addresses, with Doctors in attendance at each. In 1911, Dr.Thomas was pressing for the appointment of a second Borough Health Visitor. In Great Britain there were many unpaid. persons helping with infant welfare, but in 1913 there were only 470 salaried Health Visitors in England and Wales. The Council adopted the 1909 Notification of Births (Extension) Act in-1912. The Notification of Births (Extension) Act of 1915 enabled half the cost of infant welfare schemes to be paid from Government grants, and in 1916 a second Municipal Health Visitor was appointed by the Borough Council. The Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, enablod any local authority within the meaning of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, to make such arrangements as might be sanctioned by the Local Government Board for attending to the health of expectant and nursing mothers and of. children who had not attained the age of 5 years and were not being educated in schools recognised by the Board of Education. The provisions of the Act of. 1918 were adoptive and the Council, on 26th March, 1919, upon a report by the Public Health Committee decided to adopt the provisions of the Act for the Borough of Stepney. As the result of this decision there was set up for the first time the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee which held its first meeting on the 26th March, 1919. (The final meeting was on the 22nd Juno, 1948). (vi) At the time when the provisions of the Act of 1918 were brought into operation in Stepney, there were 20 Infant Welfare Centres, 4 Ante-Natal Clinics, 10 Creches and a Dental.Clinic, all of which were operating in the Borough on a voluntary basis. In this year the Council appointed four Health Visitors. The Infant mortality rate was then 115 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 178 during the five years from 1890 to 1894. Within two years, 14 Municipal Health Visitors had been appointed, 5 Municipal Infant Welfare Centres had been established in the Borough, and the milk scheme was further developed, the cost of this scheme having, within one year ended December 1919, mounted from Â£10 to Â£500. In this year 94 cases were supplied. During the following year the estimate for the milk scheme was increased to Â£3,000, and 1,381 persons benefited from the scheme. About this time the Infant Mortality rate showed a noticeable improvement, the number of deaths for the year 1922 being 79 per 1,000 live births as compared with 115 for the year 1918. Developing the maternity and child welfare services on progressive lines the Council increased the number of Health Visitors and established further welfare centres. The milk scheme was further extended and by 1924, 10,000 persons were supplied during the year at a cost of Â£4,000. By 1926, there were 6 Municipal Welfare Centres and in addition seven Convalescent Homes were being used by.the Borough Council. During the following five years 7 Municipal Welfare Centres were in operation in addition to the 9 Voluntary Infant Welfare Centres. Prior to the commencement of the war in 1939 the Council employed 10 Health Visitors, there being in addition 14 Voluntary Health Visitors. There were 7 Borough Infant Welfare Centres and 9 Voluntary Infant Welfare Centres, and 5 Voluntary Day Nurseries. On the outbreak of the war the 5 Voluntary Day Nurseries were evacuated to safe districts and the Borough remained without day nurseries until 1942, when the War-time Day Nurseries were opened, one at the. Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children, Glamis Road accommodating 50 children, the second at Old Church Road with 60 children and the third at Robt Montefiore School, Vallance Road with 60 children. Only one of the 5 Voluntary Day Nurseries (St.Paul's, Wellclose Square) returned to Stepney after the war and is still functioning. Only one Voluntary Infant Welfare Centre, The Dame Colet at 29. Duckett Street, continues in the Borough, the remaining 8 which were operating in the Borough in 1938 having been taken over by the Borough Council on the following dates:- Shadwell Memorial Hall, 291 The Highway in 1940; Women's League of Service, 12 Clare Street , the Minories-December 1940; St.John's Mission Hall, 61 carr Street - December 1941; East Stepney Jewish Centre, Beaumont Street - August 1942; Jewish Infant Welfare Centre, Berner Street-1943; "Jewish Mothers Welcome," Berner Street-1943; Jewish Infant Welfare Centre (of the "Jewish Sick Room Help Society") 36 Underwood Road in 1945; Stepney Infant Welfare Centre and School for Mothers, then at No.2 Salmon Lane in 1946. (vii) Side by side with the foregoing activities the Council have developed a Home Help Scheme, but from 1939 to 1943, owing to the war, this scheme was held in abeyance. In 1943 the scheme was revised for Domestic and Home Helps, the Domestic Helps being provided to assist in the homes where necessary owing to ill-health or old age, and Home Helps for expectant mothers. In 1947, a Nursery Creche with morning and afternoon sessions for 30 children was opened at 57, White Horse Road. In Novamber of the same year the Council opened the Mary Hughes Centre and Nursery at Underwood Road having acquired the property which was formerly occupied by the Jewish Maternity Hospital and carried out extensive works of conversion and adaptation. The Council's Day Nursery at Robt.Montefiore School, Vallance Road and the Infant Welfare Centre at Hughes tensions, Vallance Road were then both transferred to these premises. At the time of the transfer of the Council's maternity and child welfare powers to the London County Council there are functioning within the Borough 3 Municipal and 2 Voluntary Day Nurseries; 1 Municipal Creche; 7 Municipal and 1 Voluntary Infant Welfare Centres and 2 Municipal Ante-Natal Clinics, while the Domestic and Home Helps service employs 65 Home Helps caring' for approximately 150 cases. In addition, a prefabricated Nursery Hut erected by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor (see p.15) in the Christian Street area is nearing completion and will provide Nursery accommodation for 55 children. Some indication of the measure of success achieved by the Borough Council's Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme is to be found in the decrease in infant mortality from 165 per 1,000 live births in 1901 to 27.7 per 1,000 live births in the year ended 1948; in other words the infant mortality rate has decreased to one-sixth of the rate recorded 48 years ago. Furthermore the maternal mortality rate which in 1914 was 3.1 deaths per 1,000 live and still births, having fluctuated very considerably during the intervening years, has reached zero this present year. At its meeting on the 22nd June this year the Borough Council expressed to all officers and employees of the Council engaged in the Maternity and Child. Welfare services, and to those about to be transferred to the London County Council and the Regional Hospital Board, its appreciation of the loyal and devoted service they had rendered and the Council's best wishes for their future. success. I too would like to add my tribute to those officers and employees of the Maternity and Child Welfare, Tuberculosis and other transferred services and I hope and feel that under the auspices of the London County Council and the Regional Hospital Board the personal Health Services will go forward to still greater successes for the benefit of the citizens of Stepney. It remains for me to express my thanks to the Chairman and members of the Committees for their continued support and interest (viii) and to thank the Staff for their assistance and co-operation during the year. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. R. O'SHIEL, Medical Officer of Health.

The total number of live births of StepneyResidents during the year was 2129 - 1095 males and 1034 females or 55 less than in the previous year. The birthrate was 21.2 per 1000 of the population. Marriages. The total number of marriages which took place during the year was 1271. Deaths. The total number of deaths, after deducting deaths of non-residents who died in the Borough and adding those residents who died in outlying institutions was 1202 - 680 males and 522 females or 217 loss than in the previous year. The death rate for the whole Borough was 12.0 per 1000 of the population (14.1 in 1947). Public Assistance and Unemployment. The Ministry of Labour and the Chief Officer of Social Welfare have kindly supplied me with the following information: (a) Estimated number of persons residing in the Borough registered as unemployed at 31 December 1948: Men Boys Women Girls 1520 25 142 9 - Total 1696 (b) Residents of Stepney in receipt of outdoor relief at 27 December 1947: Men Women Children 207 384 251 - Total 842 In view of the passing of the National Assistance Act on 5th July 1948 no persons now receive Poor Law relief. Alternative assistance is now administered by the Assistance Board of the Ministry of Pensions. -5- Stepney Borough Council Information Service. An Information Centre, under the direction of the Borough Librarian, Mr.G.Newland, and his staff, was opened at 671a, Commercial Road, E.14 (Stepney Green 2218) on the 6th December 1948 to supply Stepney citizens with information and advice on all everyday problems e.g. National Health and Insurance, Family Welfare, social and dories tic problems, local activities, education, form filling, etc. With the growth of the new Social Services it is essential that every member of the public should be aware of the benefits to be obtained from these services and the Stepney Information Centre will advise accordingly. At the date of publication of this report, close on 2,000 residents in the borough have consulted the Information Service on their various problems, not the least of which is "how they are affected by the Health Services." Welfare of Aged Persons (see also p.26). The plight of aged persons in the Borough has given concern to the Borough Council, and on the 4th February a resolution was passed, as a result of which a large conference, representing all the interests in the Borough, was called on 22nd March. Arising out of this, the Women's Voluntary Services have provided a "Meals on Wheels" Scheme, assisted by a grant from the Borough Council under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act 1948. The service started on 26th April, and at the time of publication of this report 1,000 meals a month are being delivered to aged persons in the Borough. A "Darby and Joan Club" has been organised by the W.V.S., with a present membership of 80, where 150 meals per week are served (see also the Home Help Service on p.9). One of the most serious problems at the present time is that of the care of aged and infirm persons. Owing to the shortage of nursing staff it is difficult to oxpand the accommodation in the Hospitals and Welfare Homes. It is not easy to get chronic aged persons admitted. -In consequence many old persons, sometimes in poor health, remain in their own dwellings (often in single rooms). Families to-day are small and. many sons and daughters, married or -6- otherwise, seem to find it impossible to care for their aged parents. The Home Help services are necessarily limited in scope, and it is not easy to expand this service. Voluntary visiting of aged persons is practically non existent, or at best very irregular. The expansion of institutional accommodation, Home Help services, "Meals on Wheels" etc. are somewhat long term solutions, but the problem is, an urgent one. Application of Section 47 of the National, Assistance Act 1948 is limited to special cases. Meantime the aged person not only requires lay attendance in his own home, but frequently the services of a doctor. The system in operation before July 1948 by which the Relieving Officer could call out a District Medical Officer no longer operates. It has been replaced by the General Practitioner Service of the National Health Service Act. I am afraid, at the present time, this Service is not working out too well for the decrepit aged. Some of them are too old and helpless to get themselves registered with a general practitioner. It involves attendance at a postoffice, collecting a panel card, completing it, and lastly, finding a doctor who is willing to take them on his panel. Temporarily, therefore, many old folk have not got a doctor. Everyone interested in old persons should try to help them with the procedure of getting a doctor. It would be helpful if, at least temporarily, some provision wore made to replace the district medical officer; i.e. the initiative in finding a doctor should not be loft with the aged as at present. The Assistance Board is most helpful as far as money is concerned. The aged usually have not only a pension, but supplementary pensions to meet any special expense. But again, some are so aged and helpless that they cannot spend their money. They require daily assistance with shopping, cooking and washing. I think this problem of the aged is more acute in the industrialised East End than in other parts of the country. -7- II. GENERAL PROVISIONS OF HEALTH SERVICES. Staff.

During the six months ended June 1948, the Tuberoulosis Care Committee considered 107 cases. Fifty five of these were patients or their families needing extra help, and with the aid of their voluntary fund the Committee were able to arrange for all the assistance required. Removal expenses to better accommodation were paid, warm clothing provided, pocket money allowed to destitute patients in sanatorium, and those without any sickness benefit. Help was also given towards the cost of holidays, speqtacles provided, and fares paid for relatives to visit patients at sanatorium for long periods. The Tuberculosis Allowances Scheme will be superseded by increased insurable benefits, and supplementary help from the National Assistance Board, but there will still be the need for the Care Committee to provide certain necessary assistance that cannot be covered by State grants. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925. These regulations provide that persons suffering from tuberculosis of the respiratory tract shall not be employed in the handling of milk or milk receptacles. Power is given to the Council to cause such persons to discontinue their employment. It was not found necessary to take action under the regulations during the year. DENTAL CLINIC.

By agreement with the Ministry of Health, the Borough Council have erected a day nursery planned by Mr.B.W.Stuttle, Borough Engineer and Surveyor, to the detailed requirements of the Medical Officer of Health, and constructed from the component parts of standard huts supplied by the Ministry of Works. The nursery will provide accommodation for between 50 and 60 children from 0 to 5 years of age. It has many unique features, including under-floor heating, and is of a simplified and convenient design, whereby the Toddlers, Tweenies and Infants Nurseries are arranged on the southern side of a wide corridor, whilst the Matron's office, the kitchen and the staff rooms are on the northern side of the corridor. The toilets for each group are conveniently placed on the north side immediately opposite the entrance to each nursery. Quarters are provided for a resident caretaker. The nursery was not completed by the Borough Council until after the 5th July, and was handed over to the London County Council on the 25th October. I understand it is the intention of the County Council to open this nursery some time in April 1949, to 4th July 1948. -15- Day Nurseries (to 4th July) Particulars as to the attendances at the Council's three Nurseries and the two Voluntary Nurseries are given below: Old Church Road Mary Hughes Queen Elizabeth Beaumont Hall (Vol.) St. Paul's (Vol.) Accommodation: 0-2 yrs. 30 30 16 - - 2-5 â 30 30 34 20 25 No. of children on Register at 30 June: 0-2 yrs. 26 28 23 - 1 2-5 " 33 38 28 29 32 No. of mothers whose children were on the Register at 30 June: (i) In employment: (a) whole-time 55 58 43 24 28 (b) part-time 4 2 8 3 - (ii) Not in employment â 1 â 2 2 Average attendance per day: 0-2 yrs. 20 22 16 - 1 2-5 " 28 33 28 22 29 Highest attendance in any one day: 0-2 yrs. 26 22 25 - - 2-5 â 30 28 37 28 33 Nursery Creche.

(a) Common Lodging Houses: There has been a notable reduction in the number of common lodging houses in the Borough: whereas in 1901 there were 04 and in 1933 18, to-day there are only 4, i.e.:- Accommodation Wilson Carlile House, 20/2 Johnson Street 258 men Salvation Army Hostel, 177 Whitechapel Rd. 535 " Salvation Army Hostel, Hopetown Street 250 women 15/16 Crlvin Street 10/15 couples This was closed in September 1941 and reopened in November 1948. Seventyfive inspections were made during the year and 3 sanitary notices served. (b) Seamen's Lodging Houses: There are now only 4 licenced seamen's lodging houses in the Borough, compared with 18 in 1931, i.e.:- Accommodation Sailors Home & Rest, Ensign Club, Dock St. 235 men 5 North East Passage 11 " Empire Memorial Hostel, 747 Commercial Road 315 " 220 Cable Street 30 " Sixtytwo inspections were made during the year. Public Cleansing. I am indebted to the Public Cleansing Officer for the following information relating to the arrangements in the Borough for the collection and disposal of refuse. No material changes have taken place in the Public Cleansing Services during the year: Salvage collected and disposed of: Waste paper 211 tons Kitchen waste 881 tons House, Trade, Street and Market Refuse disposed by controlled tipping under Ministry of Health Regulations. 42,359 tons The Council's policy of replacing a portion of the motor fleet has been continued and during the year under review 7 Scammel Sssloo vehicles were acquired. A notable feature of this type of vehicle is mechanical rear loading, the adoption of which relieves the dustman of an appreciable part of his arduous duties. -24- Rodent Control. The staff consists of an Assistant Rodent Officer, 1 clerk 3 rodent investigators, and 7 operatives. The work done by the Rodent Section of the Public Health Department under the Ministry of Agriculture & Fisheries (Infestation Division) Schemes, N.S.12 and N.S.19, for the first three months of the year was under N.S.12, and the remaining nine months under N.S.19. As 15 out of the 16 districts were completed in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1947, the remaining district was investigated and treated under N.S.19. Since 1st April, 1948, 12 districts have been investigated and treated, and the remaining 4 districts will be completed by the 31st March, 1949. A "Block Control" scheme was successfully carried out at the Spitalfields Market. In addition, the riverside wharves were investigated and 10 wharves received treatment. Open sites and derelict premises continue to be a source of nuisance due to inability to treat them because of the danger to the public and animals. At the request of the Ministry's Technical Branch, live and dead rats have been supplied to them for experimental purposes, and included in one batch were three albino ship rats, a rarity much appreciated by the experts, who state that there have been only two other known albino specimens among ship-rats in England. The specimens were skinned, treated and mounted, and one was returned for instructional purposes.

The Borough Engineer has kindly supplied me with the following information. In accordance with Local Authority Circular N.S.6 (dated 29th August 1944) issued by the Ministry of Food (Infestation Division) two treatments for the destruction of rat3 in sewers were carried out during the year, viz. from 8th December 1947 to 24th January 1948 (inclusive) and from 31st May 1948 to 29th July 1948 (inclusive). The system adopted was that recommended, viz. 2 days pre-baiting and 1 day poison baiting. The pre-bait used was damped sausage rusk and the poison zinc-phosphide [2Â½%). 1,256 sewer manholes were treated during the first period and 1,307 during the second period. Post War Training of Sanitary Inspectors. Six students were given practical training with the Council's Sanitary Inspectors under the special scheme prepared by the Ministry of Health for ex-Service students.

During the year it became necessary for me to apply to a court of summary jurisdiction for the removal of five persons under Section 224 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (see also page 6). -26- Mortuary. The Borough Council under Section 234 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, provide a Mortuary at Branch Road for the reception of dead bodies. During the year sixteen bodies were deposited therein M. F. Adults 13 2 Children l - Burial of Dead Bodies. Under Section 50 of the National Insurance Act, 1946, it is the duty of the Borough Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died or has been found dead in the area and where no other suitable arrangements for burial have been made or are being made. Sixtyfive bodies have been buried under the above powers since the appointed day, 5th July, i.e.:- St. Patrick's Leytonstone (R.C) East London Plaistow (C.E) OUTSIDE AREA TOTAL Tottenham (C.E) Che1msford C.E) Adults and children over 10.

The debris from the many war-damaged premises in the Borough was largely removed during and since the war partly by the War Damage Scheme of the London County Council and partly by the Borough Council in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and the War Damage Commission. Most sites were left in a clean condition and bombed premises boarded up. I regret to have to report that in Stepney as in other parts of London unscrupulous members of the public have developed the habit of dumping household and trade refuse on the sites and many hoardings and protective fences have been torn down. The gradual accumulation of refuse has caused a major annoyance to law-abiding citizens in the areas concerned. The removal of such refuse cannot be undertaken by local authorities' Public Cleansing Departments who are limited by existing legislation to clearing roads and pavements. Section 93 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936., gives limited powers to the Public Health Department; but this peace-time legislation is inadequate to deal with a problem arising out of the war. Although the Council is enforcing Section 93 as far as practicable a number of sites recently cleared are again being used as dumping grounds. Sites Rubbish cub.yds Hardcore cub.yds Under Section 93 the Public Health Department have cleared 21 1156 249 In addition the War Debris Clearance Scheme operated by the Borough Council War Damage Department cleared:- Sites: 26 1757 2397 Under Section 33 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1925, efforts are being made by the Works Department of the Borough Council to fence in cleared sites as far as possible. Unfortunately most of the legislation in connection with the preblem of refuse accumulations is clumsy and difficult of application. -28- CONFERENCES, &c.

With a view to encouraging this type of trade, the Council formulated on the 18th March a Code of standards, full compliance with which entitles them to a Certificate of Hygiene issued by the Borough Council. Over 269 tons of unsound food were condemned necessitating the issue of approx. 2,000 condemnation certificates. Work on food salvage increased towards the end of the year when the Salvage Division of the Ministry of Food was disbanded and, in substitution, certain wholesale grocers and food manufacturers were registered by the Ministry to act as agents dealing with this class of goods. One such firm in the Borough is very actively engaged, dealing with large consignments of salvaged foodstuffs of all kinds. Legal proceedings were taken in 32 instances, 26 under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, 4 under the Defence (sale of Food) Regulations and 2 under the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment ) Regulations, 1947. Fines amounting to Â£128 and costs of Â£78 were imposed. Seventeen of the summonses were in respect of unsatisfactory conditions at various food premises, 10 were in respect of unsatisfactory samples and 5 were for selling articles of food which were unfit for human consumption. -40- Summary of inspections, etc. by the special inspectors engaged in the supervision and inspection of food.

In this instance, although the cowshed is licensed for 36 cows, only 12 are kept. Prior to the last war, over 400 cows were maintained in cowhouses in the Borough. A sample of bulk milk was taken from the cowshed and submitted for examination for tuberculosis by guinea pig inoculation. The sample proved to be negative to tuberculosis. Thirtythree samples of milk were taken in course of delivery to schools, hospitals and institutions etc. in the Borough. Twentysix of the samples were taken in course of delivery to hospitals and institutions, 4 to schools, 2 to L.C.C. Meals Centres and 1 to a Day Nursery. All the samples were submitted for chemical analyses and were found to be genuine. Thirtynine licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1936-1946, as follows:- Dealer's licences Supplementary licences. "Pasteurised" 15 9 "Tuberculin Tested" 9 6 The following samples were submitted for bacteriological examination: Nature of sample. No. of samples Number unsatisfactory and action taken.

The provisions of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947, have not yet become fully applicable owing to the issue of the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Amendment Regulations, 1948, which postpone the enforcement of that part of the original Regulations dealing with cooling apparatus. Difficulty is also still experienced by the trade because of the shortage of certain types of essential machinery. In consequence it has not been possible to achieve, in all cases, the most desirable method of production. The total number of premises registered in the Borough is .176, of which 40 are registered for manufacture. These premises were all systematically inspected by the Food Inspectors during the year, 536 inspections being made for this purpose. In 40 instances, it was necessary to write to the proprietors for improvement or cleansing, and in two cases legai proceedings were instituted for dirty utensils. There has been a marked improvement in the standard of purity due in no small measure to the regular supervision of premises and advice given, particularly to manufacturers. This is borne out by the following table giving.results of the 162 samples which were taken and submitted for bacteriological examination. It will be seen that 39 per cent of the samples reached the satisfactory bacteriological standard approved by the Ministry of Health. In fact, 21 per cent of the samples were Grade I whereas none attained this standard in the previous year. 1947. 1948.

Butchers1 Shops & Stalls. 505 inspections were made during the year and 29 notices served. Bakehouses, Baker Shops. 329 inspections were made and 51 notices served. There were 72 bakehouses in the Borough, of which 21 are certified Basement Bakehouses. One of the latter ceased during the year and has been removed from the register of basement bakehouses. Catering Establishments. 879 inspections were made and 156 notices served.

In November, the Ministry of Food circularised Local Authorities drawing attention to evidence of cysticercus bovis in cattle in different parts of the country, including Scotland. The most commonly affected sites are the muscles of mastication, the heart, the head, the tongue and the pillars of the diaphragm. Inspection of the carcases in the slaughterhouse guards materially against infested meat finding its way to the public, but as an added safeguard, visits were made by the Council's Meat Inspectors to all butchers, offal dealers and prepared meat dealers in the borough. The fullest information was given to them on the method of inspection for the detection of the disease and they were advised to communicate immediately with the Public Health Department if they came across any suspected cases. In addition to these visits, a circular letter was sent to all dealers concerned. Caseous Lymphadenitis in imported mutton. Under the Public Health.(Imported Food) Regulations, 1937, the importation of meat from which a lymphatic gland had been taken out was prohibited except in the case of a gland necessarily removed in preparing the meat. As a result of the Public Health (Imported Food) Amendment Regulations, 1948, which came into operation on 1st May, 1948, such prohibition does not now apply to imported mutton and lamb. The method of inspection and judgment of carcases has also been amended by Memo.62B Foods, issued by the Ministry -44- of Food in April, 1949. Caseous lymphadenitis is more common in imported South American mutton and sheep than in Australian and New Zealand mutton. From time to time, quantities of imported mutton are delivered to Middletons Cold Store, Wapping. A detention notice is served under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937, and a 5 per cent. examination is carried out and the prescapular, superficial-inguinal, supra-mammary and precrural lymphatic glands of sheep are incised and examined as routine. No carcases have been condemned as a result of this examination during the year. Since 1st May, 1948, it has been found that a more thorough examination of the associated lymphatic glands in South American mutton has teen made by the exporting countries. Several carcases have had either one of the prescapular or one of the precrural lymphatic glands removed, but on a detailed examination, in accordance with Memo 62 and Memo 62B Foods, no evidence of disease has been found in these carcases or the other lymphatic glands, and the meat has been released for human consumption. A total of 619 carcases were examined during the year but none were condemned as unfit for human consumption. Food Salvage. The methods of food salvage in operation since the early days of the war were changed by the disbanding of the Ministry of Food Salvage Division on 30th September, 1948. As a result, the Food Salvage Order came into force on 1st October, whereby such goods are handled through certain wholesale grocers and food manufacturers who have registered with the Ministry of Food as salvage dealers. Some 14 firms of this kind in Stepney are so registered. One firm in particular has engaged in salvaged food extensively, handling most of the returned ships' food stores from the ports of London and Southampton, food coming into the possession of the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police and also goods from the Railway Executive. This has necessitated the inspection of considerable quantities of food of various kinds and a good deal of time has been devoted to this work. It may be interesting to mention the classification applied when inspecting salvage goods, which is:- (a) Fit for human consumption. (b) Fit for human consumption after treatment or processing. (c) Suitable for manufacturing purposes for human food, or for catering trade. (d) Unfit for human consumption and suitable for animal food or manufacturing purposes other than for human food. (e) Fit for destruction only. -45- Inspection of Food on Wharves. The amount of imported food condemned at the various wharves in the borough during the year was approx. 90 tons. The major portion of this was disposed of by the Public Cleansing Department but where possible, unsound food is diverted for animal feeding purposes. A considerable amount of damaged foodstuffs was examined on behalf of the Ministry of Food to ascertain if such foodstuffs were suitable for manufacturing purposes for human consumption and this has resulted in the saving of foodstuffs which, although unsuitable for retail trade, could be used for manufacturing purposes. Liaison between the Council's Wharf Inspectors and the Commodity Officers of the Ministry of Food continues to work satisfactorily and no difficulty has arisen as the result of the implementation of the Salvage Goods Order. Unsound Food. In addition to that dealt with at Bishopsgate Goods Station (see 'Zoebrugge-Harwich Train Ferry'), the following is a list of quantity of unsound foodstuffs disposed of during the year under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937, and the Food and Drugs Act, 1938.

The following were found to be unsound and were stopped and destroyed: 1450 packages Belgian cherries, 400 packages Italian apricots, 200 packages Italian grapes, 499 packages Italian peaches, 13 cases Hungarian turkeys and 75 cases of Hungarian chickens. The total weight of this was 20 tons lOcwts. 3qrs. 0lbs. -50- VI. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS OTHER DISEASES Notifications. 1350 notifications (other than of tuberculosis) were received, or 45 more than in the previous year (see table, page 55). Corrected Diagnosis. 45 cases of infeotious diseases removed to hospital were found not to be suffering from the disease stated on the certificate. Of these 10 were cases of Scarlet Fever, 22 of Diphtheria, 5 of Measles, 3 of Whooping Cough, 2 of Cerebro-Spinal Fever, 1 of Erysipelas and 2 of Dysentery. Diphtheria Immunisation. In addition to the sessions held at 35, Stepney Green every Friday afternoon, children were also immunised at most of the Infant Welfare Centres (to 30 June 1948): 35 Stepney Green Infant Welfare Centres Total Und. 5: Over 5 No. of sessions 26 - 26 Post Schick tests 133 41 295 469 Immunisation cates given 109 31 275 415 Attendance of children for Schick or sation 706 97 1570 2373 Children who completed the full course of immunisation 110 7 423 540 Secondary injections 8 2 - 10 Diphtheria Immunisation in relation to child population.

Where persons are precluded from continuing at work by reason of being a carrier, or having been in contact with infectious disease, benefits under the National Health Insurance Act, 1946, are only paid on production of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. It was not found necessary to issue any such certificates during the year. Authentication of Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Circular 60/48 of the Ministry of Health relates to the difficulties in some countries by travellers from the United Kingdom who are required to prove that the certificates of vaccination or inoculation carried by them are genuine. In several parts of the world certificates are not accepted unless endorsed by a medical officer in the government or municipal service in which they are issued. The purpose of this is to provide proof that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Arrangements were made to have the signatures authenticated by endorsement of the certificates, and during the year 41 such signatures were authenticated by me. Verminous Persons.

Contained 140 parts sulphur dioxide per million. No action. The Preservatives, etc. in Food Regulations, 1925-1940, state that sauces may contain 250 parts per million of benzoic acid as preservative. (and apparently may contain sulphur dioxide if an article in which sulphur dioxide is permitted is used in the manufacture.) but S.R.& O. 1947, No.876 states that tomato ketchup must contain no fruit or vegetable other than tomatoes (except onions, garlic and added spices) and future legislation recommended by the Food Standards Committee 1948 requires tomato sauce, etc. to have the same composition. Such a product would not contain sulphur dioxide. The presence of sulphur dioxide in a few of the samples examined is presumably due to an earlier Ministry notice, PS/175, 3rd June 1943 allowing manufacturers to use apple pulp containing not more than 350 parts sulphur dioxide per million.
