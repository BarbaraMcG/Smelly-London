REPORT TO THE VESTRY OF PADDINGTON. Vestry Hall; June 29th, 1872. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit an Annual Report, as usual, on the several Works executed, and the chief business transacted in the Paving, Lighting and Sewers Departments, during the year ending Ladyday, 1872. Paving. The Carriageways in Church Street from Hall Place to Edgware Road, and in Bishop's Road, (near the Royal Oak Tavern) have been widened, and the Footways there re-paved, in a manner to accommodate and facilitate the traffic in those places. In other Streets, Improvements have been effected by removing the Gravel from the Foot-paths and substituting Yorkshire Flag Paving. The Footway Pavements have been re-laid and repaired where necessary. The Water Channels, Crossings at intersections of 4 Streets, and Cab Stands in several Streets have been Paved with the best description of Granite Cubes. The existing Channels and Carriageway Paving in various Streets have been re-laid and repaired. With the aid of our Steam Road Roller, the Macadam Carriageways have been firmly and expeditiously repaired, and the closing of the Thoroughfares for Carriage Traffic, as sanctioned by the Metropolitan Board of Works from time to time, greatly facilitated the execution of the Works. Under the powers of "The Metropolis Management Acts," Three New Streets have been formed and paved by the Vestry, at the cost of Owners of Houses abutting on such Streets. The length of additional Streets completed at the cost of Owners of Property, and taken to by the Vestry, with the previous extent of Parish Roads, make a total of 41 Miles and 200 Yards. The Gas and Water Companies, and other parties have opened the Streets in 2,321 places for the purpose of laying and repairing pipes, and executing various alterations and additions to Houses and Stables. Lighting. Ten additional Lamps have been erected within the Parish, making a total of 1,658. The removal of twenty-one Lamps to new positions have been effected for the purpose of improving the lighting of certain Streets. 5 Buildings, Sewers and Drains. Fifty-eight Notices have been given to the Vestry, in accordance with the 76th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, for the erection of 184 Buildings, viz.:—1 Permanent Church; 1 Temporary Church; 3 School Buildings; 160 Houses; and 19 Stables. The Orders of the Vestry for the drainage of the before mentioned Buildings have been served upon the Applicants, and Copies thereof filed at the Vestry Hall. Ninety-five Applications for the construction of Drains under the Public Roads and Footways to 114 Houses and Premises have been received, and the Works executed at the Owners' cost.

Four miles, one furlong, and seventy yards of Brick Sewers, in which the deposit varied from six to nine inches in depth, have been cleansed, and the hard deposit removed by the Contractor to the Vestry, at a cost of £103 : 13: 8½. Seven side Entrances in various Streets have been constructed, to allow of a more ready access to the Sewers for cleansing purposes, and examinations of drains and traps. Twenty-six Air Openings have been made in Manholes and Sewers, and Cast Iron Gratings fixed level with the surface of the Carriageways for the purpose of ventilation. One Flushing Shaft and one hundred and 7 teen Gulleys have been constructed, and forty-nine Gulleys repaired in various parts of tlie Parish. Forty-one Gulley Drains have been cleansed and the soil carted away. The Sand or Catch Pits constructed beneath the grates of the Street Gulleys have been emptied and cleansed, and the deposits removed therefrom, at the rate of 35 gulleys per day; making an aggregate of 10,206 removals during the year. Five hundred and twenty-nine distinct Works relative to the repair of Sewers and Gulleys, laying pipe drains, fixing traps, cleansing, &c., have been executed at a cost of £1,835:17:5. This amount includes the sum of £G66:9:5 received from various parties for fixing traps at outlets of drains, constructing gulleys in new Streets, laying new drain pipes under Footways and Roadways in connection with House drains, and for examining drains as to cause of stoppage in them, and their want of traps. In addition to the above mentioned Works, two hundred and twenty-three subjects of Complaints have been received and entered in a Book kept for that purpose, with reference to stoppages in Gulleys, Drains, Sewers, &c., and in most instances the drains were relieved and the cause of complaint removed.

Gentlemen, In accordance with the requirements of the Metropolis Local Management Act, I have the honor of laying before you my fifth Annual Report on the Sanitary condition of the Parish during the year ending Lady-day last. I also avail myself of the opportunity of again making notes and observations on special sanitary matters, which I trust are worthy of your consideration, and will be hereafter found useful. Besides the usual statistical statements now extending over 5 years, showing the mortality from certain forms of disease, which it may be remarked sanitary authorities have more or less a power of controlling or preventing, viz.:—the deaths from zymotic diseases; deaths from the tubercular and wasting diseases; and deaths in young children under 5 years of age — you will find a large amount of interesting information relating to the social and vital condition of the population of the Parish, chiefly obtained from the returns of the census of the people, taken in April last year— 4 an inspection of the enumeration books having been placed at my command for these researches, by Capt. Clode, the Secretary of the Census Office, the application being made at the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee. Desiderata in the Decennial Census. It is much to be regretted that returns of the decennial census when published will not give more precise information of streets, or groups of streets, or certain well-defined districts of large towns throughout the kingdom ; a correct official return as to the density of population, the housing of people in certain streets, their ages, and occupations, are all very essential data for every local officer of health, enabling him for the efficient discharge of his duties to compare the prevalence of disease and death in different places, and under varied social conditions. I have endeavoured to supply this desideratum, by ascertaining the population of all the streets and places in this Parish for future reference; and I have studied the composition of certain streets in particular, where the information is likely to be utilized for future sanitary work. The census returns in the present form apply only to registration districts, sub-districts, or ecclesiastical districts, and where a Parish like Paddington is large, but still forming only a part of another district, viz.: Kensington, the information is too vague and must be in a separate form for special use. 5 Divisions of Districts referred to. The different ways in which the Metropolis has become divided for various purposes, are such as tend to complicate the working out of statistical results. The registration districts, or a sub-district taken as the unit or basis having well-known population, births, deaths, &c., are scarcely ever in uniformity with districts defined for other purposes. The Borough boundary for example, does not correspond with a School Board district; the Post Office and Police have districts at variance; the Parish, with its division into Wards, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, does not correspond with either of the above, nor with the sub-registration districts,having known populations; Ecclesiastical districts appear to be best defined and are selected for some reason for census districts. The Poor Law Medical districts again, and the Vaccination districts, also differ, so that it becomes difficult to compare one set of facts with another. The births and deaths, the number of houses and people, the number of males and females at given ages, or of any particular trade, the number of paupers, prisioners, lunatics, sick in hospitals in any one or more of these districts ought to be more readily accessible to the public Authorities, and capable at any time of being utilized for Statistical information when discussing questions bearing upon the local taxation, the water supply, the gas, or other purposes. 6 TABLE I.

A birth rate of 29 per 1000, and a death rate of 18.6 indicate a most favourable state of public health in Paddington, but if studied in detail, it calls for some remarks. In St. Mary's District, taken separately, the deaths would be 22 per 1000, while St. John's would be only 16. Some streets have a very high death rate, as high even as 40, while other streets are as low as 7.5. See Appendix, of Statistical returns for certain Streets. One cause of a low Death Rate. It has been observed in the Report of the Registrar General, that the London mortality is diminished by domestic servants, shopwomen and milliners coming from the country, and returning to their native air when health fails them ; it is not therefore surprising that the large number of this class of persons in Paddington should materially 7 influence, and tend to lower the death-rate in the district of St. John's. The question as to the effect of immigrations and emigrations on the rates of mortality, has had some attention from T. A. Welton, F.S.S., whose researches show that in estimating the comparative salubrity, or otherwise of districts, a risk of falling into serious error might take place if this be not kept in view. For instance, large towns have naturally a mortality higher than the general English rate, but as pointed out in both Liverpool and London the rate of mortality was actually lower between the ages of 10 to 35, than in adjoining country districts. This statement will be easily understood when we know that there are nearly 100,000 female domestic servants in London between ages of 10 to 35—most are immigrants—for London girls do not take well to service. I have also shown in the Appendix that in populated streets, vast numbers of adult males are from the country, and doubtless some have parents still living, to whom they return when sick. The country therefore takes back disabled persons, many of whom die there; thus, the mortality returns of counties around London show abnormal rates at middle ages. It is fearful to think how great would be the real mortality of urban populations, if all these deaths were taken into account as they ought to be, in estimating the insalubrious agency of cities upon the working population. * On the effects of migrations on local rates of mortality, C. and E.

The same is also observed with respect to deaths from tubercular diseases; and 3. a less proportion of deaths in children, under 5 year3. Although as shown in the same Table, there has been an annual average addition of 2100 persons to the population, all these forms of death stand at the same numbers, or are actually less than they were five years ago. For example— 374 in 1868 against 334 in 1872 Zymotic deaths. 300 in 1868 „ 303 in 1872 Tubercular diseases. 793 in 1868 „ 724 in 1872 Deaths under 5 yrs. and in young persons between the ages of 5 and 20 the same favorable result is shown:— 129 in 1868 .. to 116 in 1872. This points to some causes favorably affecting the population at early ages, and may fairly be attributed to sanitary and social improvements, brought about by systematic sanitary inspection of houses, telling upon the rising generation, if not keeping disease at bay, rendering less dangerous and fatal the diseases which kill at those ages. In 1868 the deaths were at the rate of nearly 20 per 1000 of the population, or one in every 52 people; in 1872, they are at 18½ per 1000, or one in every 54. If the death rate had been the same as in 1868, 150 more persons would have died in the Parish. 11 This gratifying fact, however, stands side by side with another of an opposite and grave nature. The same Table V. shows also a gradual increase, during the last five years, in the proportion of deaths at the middle periods of life. The number of persons dying at ages between 20 and 60 have increased in the ratio to the population. For example— In 1868-9:— 225 persons died between the ages of 20 to 40, or at the rate of 2 . 3 per 1000 of population. 260 „ between the ages of 40 and 60, or at the rate of 2.6 per 1000 of population. 266 ,, between the ages of 60 and 80, or at the rate of 2 .8 per 1000 of the population. But in 1871-72:— 288 persons died between the ages of 20 and 40, or at the rate of 2.9 per 1000 of population. 304 ,, between the ages of 40 and 60, or at the rate of 3. 0 per 1000 of population. 325 ,, between the ages of 60 and 80, or at the rate of 3.2 per 1000 of population. Why a death-rate at these ages should have averaged 7.7 per 1000 in 1867-8, and 9.1 in 1871-2, is a subject for investigation ; but we have probably not to look far for an explanation. I scarcely expected to find such a state of things so near at hand in this Parish, as I endeavoured to predict in my Report of 1868-69, p. 14. There has been for some years a large influx of persons mostly of the working class, coming from the overcrowded and unwholesome houses of other districts of the Metropolis. Large numbers of the newly- 12 built houses being let out in tenements and single rooms, attract a class of persons barely able to obtain necessaries of life, amongst these not a few are of intemperate and demoralized habits, with feeble vital stamina—consequently there is, and will be, a larger proportion of sickness, chronic pauperism and deaths in the parish than formerly. This deterioration of race has for some time been recognized by Medical Officers of Health, and it forms chiefly the staple practice of Poor Law Medical Relief of large cities; statesmen, too, are beginning to look to it, for if it be not a phase of national decay, it is as Mr. Disraeli spoke of it at Manchester, "an evil of such enormous and growing proportions, that it should be earnestly and instantly grappled with." Density of Population in parts of the Parish. Paddington forms two sub-districts of the Kensington Registration District. The population in April 1871, was— In St. John's District 38,082 In St. Mary's . ,, 58,702 96,784 The annual rate of increase during the last 10 years was 2100 persons; therefore the population at the present time, with one year's increase added, is 98,984; it will be 100,000 when this Report is printed and circulated. I he number of persons to each house would 13 appear to average about 8. The number of persons to the statute acre of surface 75.6 ; this, however, includes one-fifth of the land which is yet not built upon. The whole superficial area of this Parish is 1280 acres, including that portion of Kensington Gardens, and of the open fields in the North-West of the Parish, estimated at 256 acres, where there are few houses. This, if deducted, would leave 1024 for the statute area of surface occupied by buildings, showing a population of 94.5 persons to the acre. The density is therefore equal to that of Liverpool, Glasgow, and Manchester —97.9; 94.8; 78.6, respectively, being the highest density of population in 20 of the largest towns of the kingdom. The four Wards were numerated as to population in January 1872:— Population. Inhabited Houses. Persons in each House. No. 1 . 21,793 2794 7.8 No. 2 . 41,029 4438 9.2 No. 3 . 18,469 2478 7.4 No. 4 . 15,522 2137 7.2 96,813 11,874 8.1 The 1, 2 & 3 Wards have therefore increased 22.210 in 10 years. The chief increase of population has been in Ward 2—341 houses, 14,775 inhabitants ; in No. 1 and No. 3, 4673 and 2762 respectively ; while No. 4 has absolutely a less population by 1,181. There are, however, parts of the Parish which, 14 if taken separately, show a much higher density of population, and such as in my opinion ought not to have been tolerated under a wise municipal policy. The following are examples:— 1. A space of ground each side of the Harrow Road, leading to the Lock Bridge, bounded on the north by the Grand Junction Canal, on the west by the Great Western Railway premises, on the east by Ranelagh Road, and south by Westbourne Terrace North and Desboro' Terrace covers a space of about 25 acres. It has almost all been built upon within the last 15 or 20 years. The streets are 40 feet wide, houses 4 stories high, basement is mostly under the street level; the area in front and back yards behind, are of the smallest possible size Here are 900 houses packed with 12,000 people ; 35 houses and 469.7 persons to the acre ; averaging 14 to 24 in each house ; nearly half the population consisting of children and young persons. 2. In the Harrow Road also, near Paddington Green, another space of ground consisting of about 6 acres, bounded south by the North Wharf Road and the Canal Basin and Wharves, east by Green Street, and north by the Harrow Road, are 275 houses ; 45.8 houses to the acre ; 10.7 persons to each house,and 493.8 persons to one acre. The small houses in Dudley Street are all let out in tenements, some having but 4 rooms, and each let out to a family ; they are princely in comparison with places I could name in many parts of the metropolis, 15 The very high mortality is not likely to be reduced by further house improvements, inasmuch as Landlords have been doing their best, and have been terribly punished by the expense of sanitary orders for maintaining these houses in a proper state. Further works for house improvements are almost beyond their power; nor is that likely to lessen the high rate of mortality of people living under these conditions. 3. The Hall Park estate, built with streets and houses within the last 15 years, stands much in the same relation to density of population and breathing space. This area includes 7½ acres of ground, having a population of 3643 persons, 303 houses— 40 houses and 486 persons to the acre ; 12 persons on the average to each house. 4. Courts on the north side of Harrow Road covering a space of half an acre, have 38 small cottages, with a population of 216 persons; some rooms are very small and are inhabited by an entire family. Some of these tenements have been condemned as unlit for human habitation, and it is hoped that the Harrow Road improvements will demolish the whole of them. In the Appendix will be found statistical details showing the rate of mortality, and the principal causes and ages of death in other streets and places similarly circumstanced to these, also in the large houses and mansions in streets and squares inhabited by the wealthy class—so that the advantages of higher civilization upon health and longevity may be easily seen. 16 Consequences of Over-crowding in Cities. I may mention a few of the natural consequences resulting in physical and moral dangers from a deficient air space. The want of an enclosed back garden, or open space at hand for recreation, compels young children to play in the street; invalids, lying-in women, mothers with infants in arms, and old persons have no where to sit out and enjoy fresh air and sunshine, weather permitting ; and strong men coming home after work are sadly tempted to exchange the stifling atmosphere of a single room for places where stimulating recreation is to be found amidst the pleasant vices of drinking and smoking. It allures them to spend hard-earned money in selfishness and extravagance, instead of devoting it to the necessities of a family home. Nor does the mischief end here ; the washing of linen, personal and household cleanliness, must be carried on by the women under insurmountable difficulties. There may be a wash-house and copper provided for each house, but the back yard, ill-paved and damp, is often too small for the linen to hang out to sweeten and dry in open air; hence the living and sleeping room, or the landing of the staircase, is resorted to for hanging up wet clothing, filling the house whilst drying with its damp and noisome effluvia. Besides the inevitable re-breathing of foul air in close rooms, deteriorating the general health, it must be remembered that most of the working people are fixed to the spot, and cannot like richer neighbours get a periodical change of climate, or 17 remove from a locality in the event of impending ill-health, or of contagious disease breaking out near them. There is this unfortunate distinction existing between the rich and the poor in reference to the influence of preventible disorders, and consequent ravages upon either class : while the wealthy are able to seek in change of climate and locality a removal from the scene, the humbler classes are nearly, if not altogether, debarred from such an advantage by inadequate means and the necessity of earning their bread in one fixed locality. It is of no avail to lament over the laws of absolute necessity, but all parties should combine in a demand for that even-handed justice to the working ranks, which, though it may not interfere with a stern destiny which consigns them to a life of toil, is bound at least to provide that the theatre of that toil shall be free from the pollutions that endanger the functions of life, and uncontaminated by contagion and death. I must say it is a scandal to the present constitution of society that the reverse of this continues from year to year in spite of all the suggestions of medical officers of health, and the warnings of experience. In vain does one plague after another ravage the family of industrial orders, and like doomed men they stand amidst the harvest of death,looking earnestly but in vain to the legislature for that help which no other power can give. Parents, children and friends drop around them the victims of a poisoned atmosphere : while they hear and feel successive warnings, the irrevocable law of necessity fixes them to the spot and they cannot flee from the danger. c 18 What is a high density of Population ? The density of population in many parts of the Parish has been referred to, and tables in the Appendix show a fact worthy of note, that a density of 130 to the square acre is perfectly compatible with the highest forms of social and domestic life amongst the healthiest and most civilized portion of a town population ; and yet we find Liverpool, Manchester, and Glasgow, reported to be the most unhealthy towns of the kingdom, have less than 100 persons to the acre. In setting out streets in which are situated, the largest and most luxurious mansions of this Parish, the superficial area allotted by builders is 15.3 houses to the acre, allowing space for gardens, squares, and streets, while the number of persons living on the square acre is 130 ; each house has nearly 9 persons on the average. Ages and Occupations of heads of families living in houses let out in tenements. Out of the 500 persons of the wage-earning class engaged in industrial occupations, living in Woodchester-street, Cirencester-street, Clarendonstreet, Brindley-street, Waverley-road, &c- streets adjacent to the Great Western Terminus, 64 per cent. were born in country places. Only 4 per cent. appear to be above 60 years. Of 83 heads of families engaged on the railway works, 68, or 87 per cent. are in the prime of life, between the ages of 20 and 40, and about the same per centage are born in the country. Of policemen, postmen and Railway officials, nearly all are drawn from the country, and 16 out of 17 are at the most vigorous age of life. 19 Trade or Occupation. Ages.

This confirms my statement in former reports, that large numbers of men born in cities have poor constitutions and deficient vital stanma, who cannot cope with their competitors from the country nor command the best labour markets of the world. In the struggles of town-life, large numbers are prematurely crushed out at early periods of their existence. In comparing outdoor with indoor occupations, we find that only 15½ per cent. of the tailors are over the age of 40, 25 per cent. of the dressmakers and needlewomen ; whilst of coachmen, cab drivers, grooms and labourers 50 per cent. exceed that age ; thus showing that the danger arising from exposure in all weathers, is not nearly so great as that arising from deficient air, and want of exercise in open air. 20 It is a curious fact that more than one-third of the workmen have wives older than themselves. Pauperism in the Parish. The valuable returns issued by the Board of Guardians in October, 1870, and in January, 1872, enable me to study more closely the condition of people living in the various streets and districts, and the relation in which they stand towards pauperism and destitution. It is scarcely necessary to show how essential it is in any investigation concerning public health and sanitary work, to observe the close connexion between sickness, a high death rate, widowhood, pauperism. In newly built parts of this Parish there are congregated into a comparatively small space a population without any open places for recreation sufficiently near to be practically available for mothers with young children to get fresh air. A sickly tenant-house population is now threatening to inundate some of these streets, the overcrowding invites disease, and a class of destitute persons become a costly burden, which, I venture to remark, must be checked, if possible, by the timely interference of local authority. The rapid increase of population without corresponding means of securing to young and growing offspring an enlarged area for breathing space, and salubrious domestic accommodation so essential to health, brings about a high death rate, and manifest itself in a sickly and puny race of people, in which the seeds of debilty 21 and disease are inborn with them, and they easily succumb to its effects In the Appendix, will be found tables, showing the number of houses, and persons in several of the principal streets who are in receipt of weekly relief, some are relieved on account of sickness ; many are widows, feeble and aged persons. The books of the Medical Officers are examined weekly for records of zymotic diseases and sanitary nuisances. The proportion per hundred living at different ages.

Cirencester Street 17 27½ 37½ 14 3¼ Woodchester Street 20 25½ 35½ 153/4 3½ 20 26 36 14½ 3 From this Table it will be seen that there are six times the number of children amongst working people, compared with an equal number of inhabitants in squares and mansions. Double the number of persons reach 60 and upwards amongst the aristocracy ; and whereas 69 per cent. are living at ages between 20 to 60 in the squares and mansions ; the same amount of vitality in the population is represented by only 50 in the artizan class. 22 Houses condemned as unfit for human habitation under the Artizans' and Laborers Dwellings Act. In order that Paddington Parish should not be behind in doing all that can be accomplished by the enforcement of sanitary laws to improve the health and habitations of the people, I have ventured to try how far it would be possible to carry out the provisions of the Artizans' Dwellings Act of 1868. It is gratifying to state that there are in the Parish very few of such miserable abodes as are to be found in some older Metropolitan districts, still a few places are in such a disgraceful state that I have thought it desirable to condemn them under clauses of the above Act. Another course might possibly have been taken, viz. to have them closed under the Nuisances Removal Act, Sec. 13, until such structural alterations as appear essential for the well-being of their inhabitants have been complied with. In my judgment however, it seemed impossible to carry out such structural alterations as are essential, particularly at the termination of the lease, which ought to bring about the demolition asked for. The following are the localities 1.—Houses in courts North of the Harrow Road. These were reported upon, and some of them condemned two years ago. The Harrow Road Improvement Act, which is likely to be carried out forthwith, will effect the result desired. 23 2.—Two Tenements in Cuthbert Street, utterly unfit for human dwellings. The Landlord agrees to disinhabit one to make room for improving the other. 3.—Rooms over stables in South Wharf Road, called "Mint Cottages," oocupied by four families. These will scarcely be able to have such alterations as to fit them for healthy dwellings. 4.—Houses in Elms Lane, consisting of (a) No. 1, Elms Lane; (b) No. 2, Elms Lane; The Surveyor's Report of which states that structural alterations may be made ; (c) Elms Cottage and Coffee House; the remedy for which the Surveyor also considers to be proper drainage, water-closet, and water supply, and thorough repair of premises; (d) Elms House, or Mission Hall. The Surveyor considers the basement, now occupied as shops and living rooms, cannot be made habitable by any structural alterations; (e) Elms House, Elms Lane. The remedies to be carried out are, water-closet accommodation, repairs, and structural alterations; (f) Two other houses in Elms Lane also have been demolished by private arrangement, to make way for new buildings in course of erection there. 24 5.—A cottage in a yard behind the Red Lion Tavern has been disinhabited as dangerous to health. 6.—A small house in Desboro' Street, situated partly behind other houses in a dark corner, having a high wall on one side, houses on another, and no through ventilation, by windows opening behind. This still stands for consideration. 7.—Three shops in Praed Street, having dark cellars below, used for dwellings, are to be disinhabited; having also been condemned as dangerous to human life, for want of sufficient air, light, ventilation, and inefficient closet accommodation. The course of proceedings instituted under the Act are now being carried out by the Vestry Solicitor, and a special Surveyor. Meanwhile it appears to me a very complicated, cumbrous and expensive machinery for effecting the simple and wholesome duty of a "local authority," charged with "taking down, or improving dwellings occupied by working men and families, which are unfit for human habitation." Vacant Building Plots in the Open Fields. Numerous complaints reach me of nuisances on the vacant building plots and open fields in the North-West parts of the Parish. I find them, upon inspection, to be in a condition far from creditable to the owners, and I may say detrimental to the interests of the Parish as well as to 25 « builders. Instead of attractive to a class of respectable persons, this suburb of London being now regarded as one of the healthy and open parts, will soon be characterized as one of the worst and most repulsive, unless precautionary measures are taken in time to avoid overcrowding and future ill consequences resulting from it. Several orders have been lately issued for better drainage in plots where water collects and stagnates in pools, emitting malaria sufficient to affect residents in the adjoining houses. Another evil arises from the practice of filling up ground with road scrapings and "slop shoots." This is highly objectionable, inasmuch as the scrapings of macadam and gravel roads contain a sufficiently large proportion of organic matter, in the form of horse dung, to evolve for some time smells from impure gases. Basements of houses will for a long time after they have been erected have a mouldy smell if built upon this made ground. Slop should not be allowed within the foundations or interior of a house, which ought to be only of concrete or dry builders' rubbish, or cinders. I have examined several specimens of this newly made soil. After the first year of deposit, it shrinks to one half its bulk from evaporation; it is generally inodorous when dug up, but it still continues to give off moisture charged with organic effluvia, polluting for some time the air in the vicinity. This arises perhaps from fish refuse and d 26 offal that have been clandestinely thrown into the stuff, and not from fæcal contamination or cesspool refuse, which, as in former years, might have found its way into these emptyings. Another complaint less serious than annoying to the new comers into the district, is the making of roads of "hard core" which for a few days in summer is offensive, and often continues so until cinders or road metal are laid over it. These nuisances, if not strictly speaking dangerous to health, are detrimental to the owners of the property and to the comfort of those who live on the spot. I am not prepared to say building operations are carried on regardless of future consequences, but I would suggest an inquiry into the subject, partly in its relation to public health, and partly in relation to the present and future prospects of this part of the Parish. The tardy way in which the public roads are "taken to," leaving frontages of new houses and mews in a sloppy and damp condition for a long period, is a sanitary nuisance, disgusting to owners and occupiers, and presents unpleasant comparisons with other parts of London, where new buildings are in course of construction. It is much to be regretted that medical officers of health have not more power over the distribution of new buildings, and, as to better plans for house accommodation much needed for the working class, as well as with regard to the public bathing and * "Hard core" consist of pots and pans, stone jars and bottles, clinkers and broken crockery, old boots, &c. It often contains oysters and fish shells in an offensive state. It is put aside and used for road foundations. 27 washing, and securing places of public recreation in the newly opened and crowded districts around London. The Metropolitan Board of Works appear to consult no medical or sanitary officer to report upon many very serious evils that are now springing up to endanger the future health of the people and increase the public burdens. Such Reports issuing periodically from that Board, would advance public opinion. The. Canal Basin. The Canal Basin has, as usual, been a source of trouble and annoyance. Last August during the very hot weather the water began to putrify and emitted a foul smell throughout the whole neighbourhood, causing a great many complaints by letters and calls at the Vestry, to know what was to be done. The Directors of the Grand Junction Canal Company were waited upon, and served with a Sanitary Notice to empty the Basin, which they almost immediately complied with, by letting off the foul water, and refilling the basin with fresh water. Fearing that the same alarm and danger to the public health would recur this year, the Sanitary and Public Health Committee passed the following Resolution, urging the necessity Resolution "that on the approach of the period for cleansing the Canal Basin, this Committee desires to draw the attention of the Canal Company to the importance of having this work done effectually, and to the responsibility which the Company will incur in case any evil results should follow during the ensuing hot season from any residue of foul matter left behind as a source of pollution." 28 of properly cleansing the bed of the Canal at the next annual period. This letting off of the water took place at last Whitsuntide (May 19th), but instead of the Company properly cleansing the whole course of the Basin, it was as usual, partially and imperfectly done. Sanitary Notices were served upon the Wharfingers who had made default in cleansing opposite their wharves, and upon the Company as the Owners of the Basin; the wharfingers did their part of the work; but the attempt made by the Canal Company was too late, in consequence of previous arrangement not having been made to provide the proper number of barges and men to remove the foul deposit, a large portion of which has been therefore left in the Basin.

In consequence of this, the subject of cleansing the Canal was again brought under the notice of the Vestry by Mr. Shaw, and Resolutions were passed for notices to be served upon the Grand Junction Canal Company. Resolved that inasmuch as it is represented to the Vestry by the Medical Officer and the Inspector of Nuisances (Clifford) that the water has has been drawn off from the Canal Basin, and that the same is now laid dry for the purpose ef cleansing, but that in several places no effectual cleansing of the mud is being made, the Medical Officer be directed to serve Notices immediately upon the Canal Company, and also upon the Occupiers of the Wharves adjoining, or opposite to such places where no effectual cleansing is taken place, that the Vestry will (if necessary) hold them and each of them responsible hereafter for any Sanitary Nuisance arising from such ineffectual cleansing. 30 Resolved that the Medical Officer be directed to apply to a Magistrate for Summonses against the Canal Company, and also against the Wharfingers contiguous to whose premises the insufficient cleansing exists, in respect of the nuisance arising from the mud and other deposits not cleansed and removed. One summons made returnable in a week, led an adjournment on account of the Secretary's name being used instead of the corporate name of the Company, The next amended summons came on a week afterwards, and upon hearing some statements on both sides, the Magistrate adjourned the case for a month, to give an opportunity for satisfying the Vestry as to the steps that should be taken. The Vestry Solicitor attended, and has for the present suspended proceedings, the Canal Company meanwhile having agreed to do all that is necessary to prevent a recurrence of any nuisance. The new wharves in the Amberley Road are almost equally offensive, if not dangerous to the inhabitants in the vicinity, from the neglected way of carrying on the manure trade, and want of better official supervision. The recommendation made in my Report of July 6, 1868 of appointing a Water Bailiff and adopted by the Company, has been a complete failure, inasmuch as he has never enforced the Bye-laws of the local Act; nor does it appear to be the wish of the Company that he should harrass their own tenants by prosecutions, for not one has ever been attempted during his period of office. 31 My belief is that Regulations under existing Acts of Parliament are operative,by which these offensive trades may be made comparatively, if not substantially innoxious. In my Report of November 5th, 1868, amongst other things which I insisted upon for the protection of the public, are (a.) that the Directors of the Grand Junction Canal Company should be compelled to attend more strictly to the bye-laws as to careless loading of manure; b. that covered carts and barges should be used for all foul and offensive matter which ought also to be removed at night or at early hours; (c.) a proper and convenient platform for the loading of boats from carts as they arrive at the edge of the canal; (d.) that owners should pave yards and wharves with an impermable sloping and smooth surface, to enable them to be kept properly and daily cleansed and scavenged; (e.) to have the water from the Basin let off more frequently; (f.) to concrete the bottom of the Basin, so that it might be easily and effectually cleansed annually, a plan long talked of, but never executed. Another recommendation I would also make, viz. be that a special officer should be employed by the Vestry to watch daily and even hourly the loadings and deposits at the Wharves, on the Canal, and the nature of materials brought into the Parish creating nuisances; pointing out at the same time the practical methods of dealing with them, and to prosecute in every instance where the Local or General Acts are violated. 32 Flushing and Ventilation of Sewers. This subject is now occupying the attention of a Joint Committee, composed of the Highway and Sanitary Committee. A series of inquiries into the condition of the Sewers in the Parish, the causes of offensive Smells from Gullies, methods of Ventilation, &c. have been referred to the Surveyor and myself which, if worked out, may lead to extremely valuable results. Sewers of deposit exist in several places where, in my opinion, the Sewer gas is a very dangerous nuisance, and calls for an immediate remedy. Whether that remedy consists in ventilation by additional openings, or by flushings, or by amending the fall, are questions not yet determined.0 The Metropolis Water Supply. The present and future sources of the London Water Supply is a subject of such deep importance that it calls for some brief remarks. The most economical and judicious methods of obtaining and of distributing water for towns, the employment of water as an agent in removing from our presence impurities that endanger life and health, and of restoring to the soil those precious and fertilizing ingredients which belongs to it, are great public questions yet unsettled. The threatened advent of cholera,and the theory of its propagation by water, evokes a more general appreciation of good drinking water ; whether also * Since writing the above my report has been made, dated July 15, 1872. 33 soft or river waters are better than the hard or chalk well waters (softened by Clark's process) is yet a question far from satisfactorily answered, or tested, either by science or practice. These problems are all intimately associated with sanitary progress. As a rule, it is unsafe to draw our water supplies for drinking purposes from rivers until efficacious legislative enactments shall have protected them from pollution; on the other hand the utilization of sewage products by irrigation, and scientific agriculture, is looked upon as a sanitary necessity, threatening, as some persons believe, the pollution of subsoil and surface water running into streams and rivers. Hence it follows that we may have to seek for our drinking water from lakes and springs, where it has filtered over primitive rocks, or through the slate, gravel, and limestone strata, and is but slightly charged with mineral matters in solution. If it should ultimately be deemed impossible to assure conditions of safety by employing water of the Thames or its tributaries, then the gigantic scheme of Mr. Hemans for bringing water from the Cumberland lakes, or of Mr. Bateman for tapping a lake in North Wales, and bringing it to London by an aqueduct, 200 miles long, might be seriously considered by rate-payers and engineers. Meanwhile, I am inclined to believe that Thames water may be collected, stored, filtered, aerated and distributed in a condition equal to most spring waters, and in sufficient quantity to meet the growing wants of the population. e 34 London is supplied with water by eight Water Companies—five of which, viz: Chelsea, Lambeth, West Middlesex, Southwark and the Grand Junction, take their water from the River Thames; and three, viz.: East London, New River, and the Kent Water Works, from other sources. About 20,000,000 gallons daily are taken from wells and springs of the chalk strata: and 87,000,000 gallons, "more or less impure water, are derived from polluted rivers" (to cite Dr. Frankland's expression). Out of 467,330 tons, nearly one ton or 208 gallons, are supplied daily to each house; and 29 gallons for each persons; 24 gallons, or 82 per cent. of the water being used for domestic purposes. The quantity of sewage pumped out again into the Thames at Barking and Crossness is 464,295, the outcome of drains closely corresponding to the intake of water. The Thames water is open to a grave suspicion. This is natural when we consider that the sewage of Oxford, Reading, Slough, Windsor, Eton, and many other towns (which at present are not submitted to any chemical process of purification) is passed more or less into the river. Dr. Frankland, of the College of Chemistry who makes the monthly analyses for the Reports of the Registrar General, has continually to condemn waters supplied to London from the Thames as unfit for human consumption. Dr. Letheby, however, objects to the tone of these reports, characterizing them as highly sensational, and calculated to mislead public opinion. The Water Examiner for the Board of Trade, also 35 Mr. Frank Bolton, says—"Considering these facts, "the frequent use of such phrases as 'living "organisms' and 'moving organisms,' and such "paragraphs as appear in the Registrar General's "Reports cannot but cause needless alarm; and he makes the following excellent suggestion— "The diversity of opinion which exists as to the "proper quality of water, points to the necessity "of a 'standard of quality' being fixed by competent "authority, defining the total solids which must "not be exceeded in a given quantity of water, and "by which standard the supply of Water Com"panies may be regulated." In the Report of October 1871, and again even as late as January this year, Dr. Frankland unfavorably reports, "during the whole of the month the Thames has been in a state of flood, it has overflowed its banks, washing manure from the surface of cultivated fields, scouring out foul ponds and ditches, and receiving the flushings of innumerable sewers and drains. As a natural consequence, the water has been, and still is, in a very filthy condition. The muddy water stored on the premises of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company is obviously unfit for human consumption. Nothing but the impossibility of obtaining a better supply could reconcile a water drinker to imbibe such a repulsive looking liquid." Efficient storage and filtration have certainly done much to purify the water before transmitting it to the consumers, but in comparison with water drawn from deep wells, or from the chalk strata, the contrast is yet very unfavourable. 36 As an example :*"Calling the amount of this impurity in a given volume of the Kent Company water 1, the proportional amount in an equal volume of water supplied this month by each of the other Metropolitan Companies was—New River,5.3; East London, 8.3; West Middlesex, 11.1; Southwark, 14; Grand Junction, 16.1; Chelsea,17; and Lambeth, 18 4. A sample of London Sewage which was allowed to soak through 5-feet of dry earth, was found to contain a smaller proportion of organic elements than that present in some of the samples of drinking water. Of 50 shallow wells, which have been condemned as unfit for human consumption, the water of only 10 contained a larger proportion of organic elements than that present in the supply of the Grand Junction, Chelsea and Lambeth Companies." The objectionable impurity referred to in these waters is the organic matter, called its "previous sewage contamination," and "the presence of living or moving organismsand I may add that "some of the waters were turbid, or of a brownish yellow colour." All this it, must be confessed amounts to a grave charge, and it will be difficult to explain satisfactorily all the objections. Water Supply of Paddington. The Water Supply of this Parish is derived from the Thames—a small part being furnished by the West Middlesex, and the remainder by the Grand Junction Company. * Dr. Frankland\s Report, Jan. 27, 1872. 37 It has always been a subject of deep importance to the inhabitants of this Parish to know how far the Thames Conservancy Board are adopting regulations provided by their Act, for intercepting the drainage of towns into the Thames. I thought it my duty to draw your attention to this comparative impurity of Thames waters in my Annual Report for 1868-69, and in asking for the cause of it, the reply from the Secretary of the Grand Junction Water Company to my inquiries declared that the Thames Conservancy Board were taking stringent measures to prevent pollution. I fear that very little has since been done in this direction, and that some pressure is required to be made upon the Board of Conservators and the Water Companies also, before a thoroughly pure supply for the future can be guaranteed. We are very much at the mercy of the oxydizing power of vegetation in the rivers and streams in converting animal organic matter into "innocuous compound;" and as that process goes on with great slowness and uncertainty, we cannot regard our present supply of potable water from the Thames as yet in a state of perfection such as to satisfy the advisers of the government, and suitable to the demands of the metropolis. The Constant Service System. The agitation going on in London for many years for constant water supply is at length likely to be successful, at least to a great extent. No doubt can be entertained about the present 38 objectionable methods of storing water in cisterns, placed generally as they are in such situations as defile its parity. The water now used for domestic, flushing, and drinking purposes is generally drawn from the same cistern. The results of vigilant systematic sanitary inspection show that in houses of rich as well as poor—water, be it originally ever so pure, runs risk of pollution from gaseous emanations from water-closet, drains, or a waste pipe, in communication with drains and soil pipe, or from dust-bins, washhouse, or scullery. Cisterns are often uncovered, and some are old and decayed butts. Much has been done in this Parish to remedy these evils by sanitary orders during the last ten years. The old Act of 1852—Vic. 15 & 16, Cap. 82— had already a provision for constant supply, on conditions, viz.:— "Four-fifths of the owners and occupiers on one main must make a requisition in writing; one-fifth of the houses on such main must be supplied with cocks, &c. to the satisfaction of the Company.'' Fresh legislation, "the Metropolis Water Act of 1871 "has again given further facilities, but at present nothing material has been done to introduce the Constant Supply Service into London. The Regulations proposed by the London Companies are required by the Act to be submitted for approval to the Board of Trade; but as they have not been agreed upon by the Metropolitan Board of Works, a list of Amended Regulations has been drawn up and forwarded to Vestries for discussion. Meanwhile the current stock of information upon the subject seems so very limited, few persons having 39 had practical experience in what is actually wanted, that I may venture to throw out some suggestions. Fortunately, the experience of Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Norwich, Sheffield, and Leeds is most complete, and the various details that have been elaborately worked out by able engineers may be found in the recent Parliamentary Reports of (W. Pole, F.R.S., &c.) the late Secretary of the Royal Commission on Water Supply.* No one should venture to settle permanent Bye-laws and Regulations for London without consulting his Reports. The following is a short summary of the most useful information on this head:— a. The lead service pipes must be of a prescribed size and strength, and the joints must be made in a particular manner. b. In some towns it is stipulated that a stop-cock shall be introduced in the service pipe, to enable it to be shut off from the street main when required. (See Manchester Report, paragraph 12). c. Waterclosets must not be supplied directly from the main, but must always be provided with a cistern or service box, of prescribed construction, to prevent waste. d. Cisterns are not considered necessary for the ordinary domestic supply, but are prescribed for special uses. e. Every cistern must be provided with a ball-cock of prescribed construction. f No waste or overflow pipe from any cistern, bath, or other water receptacle is allowed to communicate with a drain, or be so placed that this water may run away unseen. Such pipe must have its lower end brought outside the house, and exposed to public view, so that any leakage from it may attract attention. g. All taps for drawing water must be of prescribed construction. h. In regard to private baths no very definite rules appear yet to have been enforced. i. All the fittings must be of such a quality and arranged in such a manner as the authorities shall approve, and must be inspected and certified by them before the water is laid on. Note.—General Report on the application of the system of Constant Service, March, 1872. 40 In the large houses in this Parish it will not perhaps be desirable to abolish the cisterns for waterclosets and ordinary purposes of the household. The great gain will be having a main constantly charged so that the potable water can be drawn off cool and fresh at all times. This change will probably necessitate some alterations of fittings, for old lead pipes now in use may not stand the pressure to which they will be subjected. A stopcock will of necessity be required on the street main, for in case of any failure in the fittings the whole house would be deluged; or what would be equally inconvenient,a whole neighbourhood might be deprived of water, if the Main Service pipes were turned off until the temporary defects were remedied. In poor neighbourhoods it would be difficult to say what plan is best; in the worst kind of property (of which there is very little in this Parish) where expensive brass taps would be stolen, injured, or left running, a stand-pipe from which the inhabitants could fetch water is the simplest and most economical ; but on the better class of tenant house property the inhabitants will insist upon a draw-off tap inside the house, or somewhere on the premises at least. The w.c. supply could then remain as now attached to the ordinary cistern, or abolished; a special water waste preventor cistern, at small cost, can be fitted on to the constant supply pipe. I think landlords must go a step further—Those who let out floors and rooms to separate families ought to provide a separate water supply on each 41 floor—that is, a tap over a sink—the one being quite an essential to the other. They should be on the landing or elsewhere at hand. Nothing is more unreasonable than for respectable persons, or families, who are willing to pay a fair rent for the place they live in, that they should have to fetch up from below every drop of water required for personal and household purposes, and then have to carry down the slops. Many other things have yet to be considered in relation to water supply, partly of an engineering character, and partly from a sanitary point of view, but they scarcely belong to my province to discuss at greater length than mere enumeration— a. plans for preventing waste; b. legal and public inspection for the distribution, or approval of fittings; c. street watering by hose and jet; d. private hydrants for fires; and e. for best way of employing the charged street main for the public fire brigade. There are, also, other matters that ought not to be forgotten in future legislation bearing upon this question, viz.: a. Ought not the Public Water Service of towns to be under the management of a Representative Public Board who would study the interests of rate-payers? rather than in the hands of private companies, who look to the highest dividend they can make for themselves. b. Should not a water company, being virtually a monopoly, be held responsible for damages arising out of neglect, either of not filtering properly, or for distributing foul water, or for effects arising from temporary absence or deficiency of supply where 42 public health has suffered thereby? The case of Bermondsey at the present time is an instance— "I venture to submit," says Mr. Simon,* "that in "this point of view the Sanitary rights of the "public are but imperfectly secured, and that "explicit legislation in the matter seems to me to "be greatly to be desired." Sanitary Work of the Year. A very large number of preliminary orders for Sanitary works have been issued, and as a rule, above 90 per cent. are attended to without further action; but Vestry Orders, under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and Summonses under the Nuisances Act have in some few instances given trouble from neglect or refusal of the owners of property to perform the duties required, although they have been ultimately complied with.

Parsons. They are mostly well kept. About 40 marine store or rag and bone shops are also under his inspection. The Bake-houses number 66, and are all in excellent condition; two or three only, found to be confined and dirty, were structurally improved. The Wharves on the Canal Basin, which on account of the offensive trades carried on, are under constant inspection. They are 24 in number; 44 11 are occupied by manure dealers; 3 by dust and slop contractors; others are gravel and coal wharves. Of Urinals and Urinal nuisances in all parts of the Parish, five are public Urinals, and 50 others under inspection are those at the public houses. Urinal nuisances most difficult to deal with, are those under archways and in corners, being not less than 20. There are 95 Mews under systematic inspection in the Parish, besides 13 livery stables and yards; the manure from which is removed in some daily, in others twice a-week, and in a few weekly. Dung-pits built up in brick-work are objected to for several reasons; wire-guards, getting more into use, are strongly to be recommended in front of stables in all Mews, they can be quickly unhooked and the manure, easily got at, can be swept up clean when carted away: while in sunk pits it is more difficult to get out; from neglect it collects, putrifies, and on its removal creates a stench. Heaps of dung unprotected are objectionable, inasmuch as fowls can get at them and scatter it about. Fried fish shops, nine in number, are under inspection; the smells have caused much trouble and annoyance in the neigbourhoods where they are situated. The proprietors of thirty-five Greengrocers' shops have had to be cautioned, or have had Sanitary Notice not to sweep and throw garbage into the streets in front of their shops. This 45 practice is becoming less and less. The occupiers are requested to have at hand a garbage basket to collect rubbish. During the whole year, the markets of fruit and fish stalls on the Saturday nights have been under regular inspection, and a Scavenger's cart goes round in the night to collect the refuse. Several lots of fish and fruit have been condemned, salt cod, 3 pads of mackerel, some shell-fish, 5 lots of strawberries, a leg of mutton, and some bacon. Slaughter-houses. There are 24 slaughter-houses in this Parish under inspection; most of them are kept in a cleanlystate, but improperly near private dwellings. The Metropolis Building Act Amendment Bill, should it pass, would legalise and perpetuate private slaughter-houses in London. It is a singular want of judgment in the promoters of this Bill, that just when Medical Officers and the public were congratulating themselves that the period would soon expire, when these nuisances could no longer exist in the Metropolis, that a medical Member of Parliament should be induced to protect them. It would have been far easier and more expedient to have promoted a Bill giving power to the Metropolitan Board of Works itself or the Local Boards, to erect, jointly or singly, public Abattoirs, and have them, as well as the meat killed in them, under the inspection of a competent officer. The revenue derived by receipts from butchers would amply indemnify the rate-payers. 46 The Parish Dead-house and Public Mortuary. The number of bodies that have been taken to the dead-house during the year was 46. Inquests were held upon 29 cases, upon which post mortem examinations had to be made. Upon a Report on the Parochial Dead-house and its inadequacy for the wants of the Parish, the enlargement of the building by an additional room has been decided upon—effecting a great improvement—so that the old room can now be exclusively appropriated to post-mortem examination, and the new one used for the coffined bodies only This arrangement is a step further towards a proper Public Mortuary, which I have so long advocated in former Reports, and in a special one upon this matter in 1868. I ought to mention that the Church of St. Mary Magdalene is now provided with a Mortuary at the basement ; and the Rev. R. T. West has inculcated the propriety of inhabitants living in these highly populated streets and those living in single rooms, removing a corpse from a private or crowded dwelling. Several families have already taken advantage of this offer. In concluding this Report, I must congratulate the Vestry upon the satisfactory state of the health of the Parish generally—for not only is there now no prevailing epidemic, but the prospect of meeting any impending one, and the powers at your disposal for mitigating its danger were never better than at the present time. 47 I would apologise for extending my remarks to this unusual length, by pleading a desire to make more known and better appreciated the scope and method of Sanitary inquiries. Indeed, a great deal more ought still to have been written to accompany the Statistics in the Appendix, and to show, as Dr. Gairdner of Glasgow aptly* expresses it, "the significance of facts taught by figures." 1 am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, WM HARDWICKE, Medical Officer of Health, Deputy Corornr for Central Middlesex, &c., &c, Record of Sanitary Works done in the Parish of Paddington during two years 1870-71−1871-72.

The amount is larger than the usual average, but 30 less than in the corresponding quarter of 1870. The Birth rate is considerably in excess of the Death rate. Besides this cause of increase in the population, there is a constant immigration into this Parish of families from other neighbourhoods, leaving old and dilapidated houses for the newly built ones in the Harrow Road and Lock Bridge districts. I cannot congratulate ratepayers upon this, for many of the families belong to an indigent class and sooner or later become applicants for parochial relief. An estimate of the population cannot be made just now with any degree of accuracy, but it will not be long to wait for the census returns, when I shall be able to know the real Death rate in this Parish, which is however not increasing. The Zymotic Diseases, &c. The Zymotic diseases account for 91 deaths this quarter, of which 16 were from Small Pox; 16, Scarlet Fever; 26, Whooping Cough; 13, Measles; 9 Fever cases; 9 from Diarrhœa. The deaths of young children under 5 years of age are very high this quarter, 204 out of 542 deaths—representing 37.6 per cent. of the total mortality. That is a very large item, and above the usual average. It appears from Table IV., that chest diseases were very fatal; measles, whooping cough, bronchitis and pneumonia carried off 81 of these young children during the last three winter months. The tubercular class of diseases, including the wasting diseases, consumption, and scrofulous disease of the brain, called menengitis, carries off about the same number (84), but at a later period of life. The mortality is capable of reduction in these three groups of disease—the infantile deaths, zymotic diseases, and the wasting or tubercular maladies—by future improved social habits and domestic sanitary arrangements. Want of fresh air from over-crowding is the greatest desideratum. TABLE II. Deaths from Zymotic and other Diseases during 12 weeks ending March 2,5th, 1871. Weeks. ending Small-Pox. Measles.

The Epidemics of both Small Pox and Scarlet Fever have been very prevalent and fatal in this Parish. The 16 deaths registered in the Parish from Small Pox do not represent the fatal deaths from the disease, for some of the persons removed to the Hampstead Hospital have died (probably 5, making in all 21 deaths as the number). The number of cases removed from private dwellings, during the Quarter ending March 25th, was 73, and 103 have been specially visited and placed under the personal superintendence of Inspector Clifford,* with the view of having the rooms disinfected and cleansed ; woollen things and bedding being ordered to be removed in a covered van to Messrs. Armfield & Son., Disinfecting Establishment, Pimlico ; and the linen articles washed with disinfectants. The quantity of goods disinfected in this establishment may be estimated by the quarter's account, which is £32—at the rate of 30s. per cwt.; this includes articles belonging to families of persons not in a position to pay for their disinfection. In an instance where 3 cases occurred in one house in succession, the house was ordered to be closed for ten days. Nine rooms were fumigated, and no fresh cases have since occurred. A large majority of cases were imported from infected districts, (Westminster especially), showing the necessity of general action with regard to isolation, removal, and disinfection. One neglected household may scatter fever poisons in all directions. With a view to prevent extension, in some instances, the ordinary duties of relatives, or those in attendance on the sick, were suspended from their labours. The Poor Law Guardians have under these circumstances not hesitated to give efficient temporary relief. Police Constables have been relieved from their duties ; a Tailor, a Dressmaker, and a Washerwoman (who had four children ill with small pox) have been restrained from sending work home from the sick room, or things out of the house before being disinfected. Where the disinfection has not been performed by the Inspector, a notice was served upon Occupiers and Landlords, who have themselves carried out the duties in accordance with the Provisions of the Sanitary Act, while Certificates from Medical men have been demanded, stating that disinfection and cleansing have been carried out to their satisfaction. We have received 32 of these certificates. It is gratifying to state that in scarcely any instance has a second case been observed in those houses where early removal was decided upon. *Since this was written (April 1st) more than a month has elapsed, and above one hundred additional cases have occurred, of whicn 80 have been removed from private houses. 7 The difficult question of finding a suitable site for the erection of an efficient Disinfecting Establishment has for a long time occupied the most anxious attention of the Sanitary Committee. Various places have been visited, and other places suggested; all of which have presented insuperable obstacles. The stone yard, the closed burial ground of St. Mary's, the spare ground of the workhouse, the open fields on the Paddington estate, a corner of the cemetery at Willesden, the wharves on the canal basin, and other situations have all had to be abandoned. A site is at length offered, which will probably be fixed upon. The working details of an efficient system of disinfection are settled. The Committee have visited the apparatus now in use in other places. My Report drawn up in November, 1869, has in no way been disputed The essential features of the recommendations consisted in a hot air chamber capable of being heated to a temperature of 250° to 300° fahr., to be used with or without disinfectants. A washing room and drying closet adjoining, with a copper and wash tub are essential. 1 object to the woollen things, bedding, &c., sent one way to be heated or disinfected, and the washing articles going in another direction, perhaps to a laundress to disseminate the poison ; all infected things ought to be taken to one establishment. Medical and other gentlemen write to express their surprise that this wealthy Parish has no fumigating or disinfecting building; and from the numerous applications made at the Vestry Hall and at my residence, it appears to indicate that such an establishment would be partly if not wholly self-supporting. At the early part of the outbreak of the Epidemic of Small Pox in the Parish, in order to meet the request for early removal and isolation of cases of Small Pox, and to obviate any difficulty that might arise, and did arise, from the want of accommodation, the Small Pox Hospitals being full, the Guardians of the Poor opened spacious wards for the reception of patients at the Workhouse Infirmary. The Vestry at the same time voted a sum for the erection of a temporary Iron Hospital on the grounds of the Workhouse, which is now used for small pox cases. This prompt decision of the Vestry, has conferred a great boon upon the parishioners, and has enabled me to remove 2 or 3 persons daily since the first outbreak, who would have had some delay and difficulty to encounter in finding a place for their reception. In the Report to the Sanitary Committee, on January 5th, I recommended temporary tent hospitals; and I still believe that a suburban encampment of tents, wooden or iron huts, is the proper way of treating the contagious maladies of our large towns, whether fever, small pox, scarlet fever, &c. They 8 can be easily ventilated, made warm in winter, and are cool in summer. All that is wanted is plenty of fresh air, suitable nourishing food, perhaps wine, perfect cleanliness, careful watching, an experienced medical man on the spot. The Sanitary Committee have taken some trouble to secure all needful comforts in connexion with the removal of the sick. Several suggestions in accordance with my report on improvements in the fever ambulance have been adopted; an air bed and pillow, a hot water bottle, a ' step for entering, better ventilation, a speaking tube, &c., a stove for warming the shed in which the carriage is kept were suggested. The mode of removal of Fever and Small Pox patients to a hospital is a matter of some tact, delicacy, and judgment; the erection of large hospitals at a distance of three to six miles away from a patient's home was not judicious; many cases of death soon after the removal have occurred; while delay in getting orders, and going through unnecessary formality is highly objectionable. The Metropolitan Asylum Hospital Authorities ought to have been charged with the duty of fetching as well as of returning home patients after they are cured. After so much has been said about Vaccination I may be spared repeating, except in a few words, what is my own as well as the general experience of medical and other observers, (a) That if vaccinated, the vaccinated cases have generally escaped the worst forms of Small Pox and are less fatal. (b) That the un-vaccinated, both adults and children have had severe attacks, (c) That there are many imperfectly vaccinated persons about, and a large number of the children in schools are not absolutely protected by old vaccination. (d) That re-vaccination has been considered desirable in all doubtful cases, and during the epidemic. (e) That few instances of Small Pox have been known to occur after re-vaccination, or after a mild attack of Small Pox. A house to house visitation, in order to seek out un-vaccinated persons has not been recommended in the Parish. Public opinion aided by a general desire for re-vaccination has sufficiently met the requirements of the Vaccination laws; except in some instances where one or two members of the anti Vaccination League, who live in this Parish, have frightened the timid and ignorant by their senseless outcry and publication of pernicious doctrines. The Board of Guardians are the authority for carrying out Vaccination, and they entrusted me with the inspection and prosecution of defaulters under the provisions of the Act of 1867. Since 1868 more than 3000 inspections have been made by me and my Assistant. A monthly list of defaulters is taken out 9 from the Registrars' books, of those persons who have neglected to send the legally required Certificate. In half of these, orders, for Vaccination within 14 days were issued; the other half had already been Vaccinated, but had neglected sending the Certificate to the Registrar of Births. Some prosecutions have taken place; some are still in abeyance, being cases where illness is either a real or an alleged excuse for delay; time is given in these cases, meanwhile they are subject to monthly re-inspection until the Vaccination is performed. The proceedings for carrying out the disinfection of Rooms and infected things are as follows:—The Room, after a Small Pox case has been removed is well closed up, and 3 or 4 pounds of sulphur are ignited with coke in a stove, aud the chamber kept closed for some hours: the paper is then striped off the walls, and effectual washing and cleansing done. In some instances we have used chloride of lime, to which dilute carbolic acid has been added. This mixture gives off a very powerful vapour, consisting of the chlorine gas, which is set free, and some of the carbolic acid being also carried off at the same time. Chlorine (simple) has also been used, it is set free by using the chloride of lime with dilute sulphuric acid; a mixture also of chloride of lime with sulphate of alum stirred up with water gives off chlorine slowly. Those who prefer non-smelling disinfectants have used dilute Condy, or chloralum, or chloride of soda for washing and sprinkling floors or moistening a blanket to be hung up in the room, and for immersing those articles which require washing. The woollen articles and bedding have been sent away in a closed conveyance to the Disinfection Contractor, Messrs. Armfield & Sons, who exposes them freely to high pressure steam, and afterwards dries them at a high temperature. Those who are not able to pay for this, have had the work done at the expense of the Vestry authority. Very few articles have been ordered to be destroyed. I am glad to state that at present there are few destitute persons whose tilings are so absolutely worthless as to see fit to destroy them. Besides, this work of disinfecting, carried out mostly under the eye of the Inspector, who has a man to assist him, private families, where medical men have attended, are ordered to do the work to the satisfaction of such duly qualified medical practitioner, and a certificate is forwarded to the Sanitary Department. Disinfectants, with instructions, are also freely distributed from the Vestry Hall, to such persons as may have need of them. I must not omit to acknowledge the active and intelligent services of Inspector Clifford. He has not only devoted his spare time to the duties of his office, but assisted personally in the 10 moval of patients and in the disinfection of rooms; and whether in or out of office hours he has never hesitated to do the work required to be done, regardless of the risk and danger to which he is exposed. It is highly gratifying to me in this trying period of an epidemic, when 1 am daily called upon to render such assistance, as the Sanitary Department of the Vestry has enabled me to administer, to state that I have had the services of an an officer who has willingly and energetically carried out my wishes and given great satisfaction to the numerous persons who have applied.

The death rate is 18.52 per 1000 per annum, viz.:—in St. John's 16.17; St. Mary's 19.56. The Zymotic diseases, (including 86 cases of Slimmer Diarrhoea) amount to 146 in the quarter. The tubercular and consumptive diseases 75; other chest diseases 27; violent deaths 12; other diseases 193. Small Pox is still epidemic; Scarlatina is also very prevalent and fatal in spite of every attention to the disinfection of rooms, removal and isolation of cases. No. 18.

The weeklyaverage deaths are 36.8. Out of the fatal number of deaths from all causes 150, or 32 percent, are deaths of children under 5 years of age; 104 deaths are of persons between the ages of 60 and 80, and 14 are upwards of 80. The death rate stands at 19'8/ per thousand per annum, excluding the 7 Small Pox cases out of the Parish. There were 299 deaths in St. Mary's, and in St. John's 170, which is the normal average of a healthy season. 2 The Zymotic diseases are as follow:—Small Pox (8 registered) 7 in addition died in the Hospital, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead; only 2 deaths are from Measles; 8 are from Diphtheria; 18 from Whooping Cough; 16 Fever cases; which stand on the Register thus:—Typhoid Fever with carbuncle, ditto with gout, ditto with pulmonary congestion; Typhus; Gastric Fever; Puerperal Fever; Blood poisoning; Relapsing Fever; Erysipelas 5; Diarrhoea 5 ; making a total of 69. The deaths from the Tubercular class of diseases amount to 80, of this the large number of 52 are persons in the prime of life, carried off by consumption. The next fatal group of diseases are inflammations and diseases of the lungs, carrying off 112 persons in the three months; 38 being children under 5 years of age, and 42 being persons 60 and upwards; 18 very young children died within the first few days and weeks after birth from atrophy and exhaustion from bad nutrition; 18 deaths are from violence and accident,including 2 infanticides and 2 suicides. After the 11th November,when the weather began to be very cold and humid, a large number of Bronchitis cases proved fatal. With the exception of the Small Pox epidemic,which seems now to have subsided, the season has been healthy. TABLE II.

[11.] Houses in Streets not under special inspection, inhabited generally by one family only. 6 Overcrowding in Single Rooms, let and sub-let by absentee Landlords. There is no doubt, from the abundant experience and records of the Sanitary Department of this and other Vestries, that houses let out in single rooms, and to several families, have endangered the life of people, have favored the spread of contagion, and are a source of pauperism and degradation. The ordinary rules of systematic Sanitary inspection once a year is not sufficient in these cases. We have power, and generally succeed in abating nuisances when discovered, but it is much easier to prevent their frequent recurrence, by registration and inspection of the worst houses. This is what is wanted. In accordance with the request of the Sanitary and Public Health Committee I have drawn up the following brief summary of the grounds upon which I believe the Vestry ought to adopt the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act in the Parish. I have strong reasons for believing that when a proposition of this kind was brought before the Vestry in 1867, it was withdrawn from want of due appreciation of the advantages which the poor as well as ratepayers would derive from it, perhaps also, in some measure, from misrepresentations and alleged injustice towards landlords of tenant house property. In looking over the stringent rules proposed for adoption in this and other Parishes four years ago, I believe the failure in carrying out this part of the Sanitary Act resulted from requiring too much supervision, and from trespassing somewhat upon the supposed rights of property and liberty of the subject; therefore it is that I now conceive a more simple set of rules may be adopted, which in no way can be complained of as unreasonable towards landlords or any one else. It cannot be denied that in the class of house property to which we now refer there is frequently dangerous and immoral overcrowding; such houses are inhabited by the lowest class of persons, and amongst them is the largest proportion of sickness and pauperism. There are persons who let out rooms to weekly tenants who take in, as a rule, a class of persons not to be tolerated in respectable tenant houses kept by a responsible landlord or landlady. The drinking and dirty people for instanee, seek out the former kind of house, where there is no resident landlord, and prefer it to the latter. The Parochial Medical Officers and the Kelieving Officers of Unions are able to show that they have on their books applicants always verging upon pauperism. The rents of many back rooms and kitchens inhabited chiefly by this class, are frequently paid indirectly, if not immediately, by money received from the Parish Board of Guardians. 7 In house property of this kind, I complain that there is no one to look after the accumulation of dust or offensive garbage, or to see that the closets are cleaned or drains kept trapped, or to attend to the general cleaning and ventilation of passages, stairs or rooms. It is in these houses that we find a man, wife, and five or six children crowded together into one small back room of 700 cubic feet space; or the front kitchen a little larger, but with less than 1000 cubic feet space, where there are not more than 100 to 150 feet for each person. A dog or two are often kept under these conditions. The following cases are illustrations:— No. 12 Bouverie Street—man, wife and 5 children in front kitchen, 770 cubic feet space; the beds, cupboards, chairs, tables, &c. reduce the cubic space less than 100 cubic feet to each person; the man is a journeyman butcher out of work. In the same house, first floor front, is a man (plumber and glazier) with his wife and 7 chtldren, with cubic space of 1200 feet only. No. 56 Cirencester Street, was a man, wife and 5 children in a front room, choked up with furniture, and articles of wet linen hung all over the room; 2 fine children were suffering from severe Whooping Cough, and 2 had died the previous week of same disease. At No. —, was found a small dirty back room, where some people kept 2 dogs, the man, and wife earning £ 3 a-week, and spending it in drink. No. 22 Cirencester Street, three instances of over-crowding in one house— 14 persons in excess. No. 46 in the same street, 16 persons in excess— front kitchen 6, back parlour 4; second floor back 6. No. 23 Netley Street, front parlour contains 5 persons; second floor front 7 persons. No. 2 Alfred Place, Harrow Road, 5 persons, with a cubic space of 560 feet. In Clarendon Street, nearly 100 persons have been displaced; and 17 persons were dislodged from one house. Many of the underground kitchens in Leinster Street, Stanley Street, Cirencester Street,Woodchester and Clarendon Streets have been inspected where the people are found living like Esquimaux, in undei ground cave dwellings—places with impure air, want of light, admitted only through a grating in front, the upper sash of the window being often out of repair, or nailed up. The Sanitary Officers are continually serving notices to abate overcrowding in single rooms (as the orders of the last few weeks fully testify). And it is to be regretted that in the newly built houses of Mews (in the Chippenham Road and Amberley Road District), rooms are beginning to be thickly populated with a pauperised class of persons, many of whom have removed from the worst part of other parishes, and from less cleanly dwellings in other places. These houses should be under supervision—many are constructed for the requirements of one family only, while frequently there are now congregated in them 4, 5, and 6 families (for which they are originally unfitted). Serious evils of a physical and moral character, are found to afflict the population of these over-crowded houses. The want 8 of fresh air, habitual uncleanliness, bad washing accommodation, with other unsanitary conditions, favor the spread of contagion. There is a notable increase of tubercular and consumptive maladies in our large cities, and the low form of vitalityengendered in people who do not enjoy fresh air, leads,to the abuse of stimulants and tobacco. It is only by measures such as I now advocate that these evils can be averted. It is for Local Hoards to see that a necessity has now arrived for prudent and judicious action. The homes of the people must not continue in their present disgraceful state, and people perish at appalling rates, without trying effectual means to prevent them. It is a question whether rich citizens are to have in their midst a thriving and industrious population, living in decent homes, or a siekly and semipauperised race, flocking from rural parts, to be supported by rates, and trusting largely to the charitable doles of clergy and lady visitors of a wealthy Parish. REGULATIONS proposed to apply to houses or parts of houses let out in single rooms, or where several families live in one house, or where no resident landlord or agent is responsible for Sanitary regulations of the dwellings. It is asked that the Vestry shall have power, if they deem it expedient to keep a register of any house, or part of a honse, let out in single rooms, to one family, or rooms in houses eontaining more than one family, where there is no resident and responsible landlord for executing the following orders:— 1.—The cleansing and lime washing of rooms, stairs, walls, ceilings, area, yard or basement, at least twice a year. 2.—For providing a proper dust receptacle, and the removal of dust at least once a week. 3.—For maintaining a proper water supply and its receptacle, to the satisfaction of the Vestry. 4.—For keeping the w.c. and drains in proper order, such as regards traps, pans, water supply, and efficient accommodation (if in common one) for about 20 persons. 5.—For the letting of rooms, where the cubic space for each adult individual shall be not less than 300 cubic feet in the sleeping room, or 350 feet if used for sleeping and living room. Two children under 10 years of age to be counted as one adult. The number of persons that each room will legally accommodate to be fixed by the Vestry Authority. 6.—To give notice, in the event of any infectious disease, to the Sanitary Department of the Vestry. 7. For the ventilation of room or rooms in such a manner as may be deemed satisfactory to the Medical Officer of Health. 8.—The Inspectors to enter at all reasonable times; and the owner or agent to visit and inspect at least weekly. 9.—For a breach or default in carrying out the above Regulations, a penalty of 40s. shall be incurred. 9 Slaughter Houses and Cow Sheds. At a Magistrate's Meeting, held October 30th, at the Vestry Hall, for granting renewal of Licences for Slaughtering Cattle, and keeping Cows, out of 28 Butchers and 14 Cow Keepers who applied for Licences, the following were refused Licenses, and others renewed:— Messrs. Barnes,Walker, Tyrrell and Greenfield refused; Mr. Wingrove's case was adjourned for 3 months. Their places, with some others in the Parish, had been visited by the Sanitary and Public Health Committee, and objected to, principally on account of close proximity to inhabited houses. These men appealed again on January the 1st, when the Magistrates refused to open the question. Mr. Wingrove's Licence was again considered on this occasion, and granted, on the condition that during the summer months the Cows should be put out to grass. Bake-Houses. The whole of the Bake-houses in the Parish, 66 in number, have been inspected, and 20 Sanitary Notices served for cleansing and lime-washing of premises. Fried Fish Shops. Mr. Dick, 24 Harrow Road, and Mr. Haskett who has taken premises at 140 Praed Street, have been complained of by neighbours on account of the bad and sickening smells. Some improvements have been effected in ventilating the stove. A summons was ordered to appear before a Magistrate, to abate these nuisances, but a fortnight was granted, since which the smell is greatly lessened. The Inspector has instructions to inspect the quality of fish and fat used, the former is often stale and offensive, the latter in a putrid and rancid state. The Small Pox Epidemic. The Small Pox epidemic which has been raging in most parts of the metropolis, prevailed in this Parish with considerable severity for a year. It now shows signs of a decline, and having a special report ready on this subject, I will here only remark, that out of 511 cases that came under the notice of the Sanitary department, 265 were removed—and that every other possible measure has been promptly taken to restrict the spread of the disease. 10 Systematic Inspection during the last Quarter.
