PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO THE 18th & 19th VIC.. CAP., 120. LONDON: A.T. Roberts, Son & Co., Steam Printing Works, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1883. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ending Lady-day, 1883. Published pursuant to the "Metropolis Local Management Acts." REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1883, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £69,410 15s. 8d.; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 6d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, 8d.; to Michaelmas, 8d.; to Christmas, 7d. ; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 5d. The amount of the Guardians' Calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1882, was £51,500; and for the last year, £54,500; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1883, is £27,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1883, was nil. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only necessary here to state that the Rates levied for the last year were— S. d. General—in the £ 1 10 Sewers ditto 0 8 2 6 6 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £69,095 4s. 0d., an increase upon the previous year of £743 5s. 2d. Of these sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposes over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £54,500 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rates and Metropolitan Asylum Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £11,828 12s. 11d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £590 19s. 1d. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Sewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £13,336 4s. 4d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £14,242 12s. 11d., and the Toll Bridges Precept of £1,899 9s. 8d. All these charges are based upon the rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, or for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. The valuation of the Parish for Assessment purposes is as follows, as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year— List in force—April, 1882. April, 1883. Increase. Gross rental £725,125 £730,240 £5,115 Rateable value 585,452 589,764 4,312 The number of Assessments and the Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, which are included in several Wards, are as follow:- Number of Assessments. Rateable Value. Moorfields Ward 1,696 77,882 Church Ward, North 2,223 52,345 Church Ward, South 1,567 52,518 Hoxton Ward 2,616 70,251 Wenlock Ward 1,823 53,816 Whitmore Ward 2,367 53,093 Kingsland Ward 1,762 42,945 Haggerstone, East and West 1,695 33,894 Acton Ward 1,790 38,538 7 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £59,770 Gas Company 28,344 Water Companies 7,350 Tramway Company 2,500 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 5,552 Hoxton House Asylum 1,000 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 3,322 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 20,896 The Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £130,472, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £454,980. The Great Eastern Railway, including Low Level Station, Line and Goods Station, has been assessed as follows (partly by agreement):— Low Level Station £900 Line 3,300 Goods Station 10,640 Arches (partially let) 790 The Company intimated their intention to appeal against the assessment for the "Line," but no official notice has yet been served. 8 IMPROVEMENT SCHEMES. The Regent's Canal, &c., Railway. The Regent's Canal, &c., Railway Company introduced a Bill this Session, but the object of it was to determine certain questions between the Regent's Canal Company and the new Railway Company, and had no direct bearing upon the Parish; the Vestry did not therefore interfere. Tramway Schemes. Two Schemes were promoted this Session, one by the North Metropolitan Tramways Company, and one by a new Company called the East London Tramways Company. The projects of the former Company were generally approved by the Local Authorities, including the Metropolitan Board; but the Bill, owing to private opposition, was thrown out on second reading in the House of Commons. The latter Scheme failed to obtain the consent of the Local Authorities and was consequently withdrawn. Electric Lighting. Several Notices were served upon the Vestry by various Companies, some of intention to apply to the Board of Trade for Provisional Orders, and others of intention to apply for consent for Licences. The only parties who followed up the notices so served and applied for a Provisional Order to supply Eleotricity to this Parish were the Metropolitan (Brush) Electric Light and Power Company. After some correspondence and a conference with the Board of Trade an agreement was come to between the Parish and the Promoters. It is very uncertain whether any of these Orders will receive the sanction of Parliament this Session, or, if so, in what form. It will therefore be advisable to reserve further examination of the details till next year. St. John's Road Improvement. The Contractors for the new Board School, in St. John's Road, have not yet made sufficient progress towards completion to enable 9 the Improvement, to which the Metropolitan Board agreed to contribute one half the cost, to be carried out. But there is reason to believe that it will be completed during the Autumn. Sun Street. Attention is called to the table (pages 12 & 13) furnished by the Metropolitan Board, shewing the financial aspect of this Improvement. All the land has been let or sold. A sum of £10,752 has been written off the Loan above the annual payments, which were spread over fifty years, and a sum derived from rents, &c., of £2,200 was paid by the Board direct to the Vestry. In each of these cases a similar sum was accredited to the Metropolitan Board. The total unpaid balance of Loan due from the Vestry was at Lady-day £43,860. Metropolitan Improvements in Shoreditch. The Metropolitan Board in their last Report in reference to the Shoreditch Improvements state:— "A plot in Bethnal Green Road (not in Shoreditch, but "near) and one in Great Eastern Street, both reserved for "working-class dwellings, were sold by auction during the "year, the former for £2,020 the latter for £2,500, the "purchasers binding themselves to erect suitable dwellings "for working persons. Part of another plot in Great Eastern "Street was also sold by private treaty in December, for the "same purposes, for £1,272. The whole of the building land "in Great Eastern Street has now been let; twenty-four "plots which remained unlet at the end of last year having "been disposed of.'' It may be gathered from the above that no further progress has been made in respect to the letting of the vacant plots in the High Street. 10 THE TOWN HALL. Daring the year the Large Hall has boon let 153 times; the Council Chamber 13 times; the Committee Rooms have boon used by Local Societies, mostly free of charges. The receipts for letting Hall, Council Chamber, and Committee Rooms were £1,026 2s. 0d. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Vestry and Commit too Meetings held during the year ended April 30th, 1883, is as follows— Number of Vestry Meetings 32 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 26 Sewers, &c., Committee 20 General Purposes Committee 35 Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committees 4 Town Hall Committee do: 15 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 9 Total 141 OFFICIAL CHANGES. In January last the Vestry lost, by death, the services of one of its most valuable officers, Mr. Chas. Davis, Assistant and Accountant Clerk, the arrangements consequent were made probationary for six months. Mr. Fletcher, the Inspector of Nuisances, resigned his office at Midsummer in this year, owing to favourable circumstances affecting himself. Tho Vestry has appointed Mr. Reid Assistant Inspector under Mr. Alexander, the Chief Inspector. 11 Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assests and Liabilities, Loans Outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, E. WALKER, Vestry Clerk. Town Hall, Old Street, July, 1883. 12 13 SUN STREET IMPROVEMENT.

The total number of lamps now in use is 1464. 2 of which are 200-candle power, 23 of 100-candle power, 1 of 60, 1 of 30, and 1437 ordinary lamps, 8 of these are fitted with governors regulated to consume 8 cubic feet per hour and 4 regulated to consume 6.9 cubic feet per hour, the remainder at 4.6 cubic feet per hour; 13 lamps are paid for by railways and theatres situated under railway arches and opposite theatres. 79 new lamps have been fixed and put in lighting during the year, 39 have been discontinued and 51 removed to more favourable positions. 7 new refuges, having one lamp each, have been erected during the year. 50 On four occasions during the dense fog in the months of November and December, lamps were lighted in the day-time in thorough fares where traffic is the greatest, amounting to an average of 2.82 hours per lamp on the whole number. In order to decrease the many nuisances caused by persons not knowing where to find Urinals, green glass tops have been fixed in place of clear glass in tin; lamps situated nearest, and a tablet with hand pointing indicating the direction where Urinals may be found, and red glass tops to lamps situated nearest to Post Offices and Pillar Boxes. It is considered that when this plan becomes known it will be of great service to the public generally. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. H. DOUGHTY, Inspector. 57 TABLE I.

To the Vestry of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. Gentlemen, 5,131 births—2,637 males and 2,494 females,—and 2,976 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1883. Deducting the deaths (246) which occurred in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 21.5 per 1,000 living, being slightly below the average of the last five years which was 21.58 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths were registered in Haggerstone District, in which is situate Shoreditch Infirmary. Population Deaths Average per 1,000. Holywell 7,376 115 15.5 St. Leonards 14,967 330 22.0 Hoxton New Town 29,937 822 19.2 Hoxton Old Town 28,036 527 18.7 Haggerstone 46,275 1,182 25.5 66 619 deaths occurred in public institutions of the parish; 309 in Shoreditch Infirmary; 246 in Holborn Infirmary, situate in Hoxton New Town; 42 in the North Eastern Hospital; and 22 in Hoxton House. Diseases acknowledged to be induced by cold and damp were, as in previous years, very destructive. There were 378 deaths from bronchitis, 269 from phthisis, and 193 from pneumonia. All lung affections are much influenced by cold and wet. 922 deaths occurred under one year: in the year before 945 deaths; the deaths under five years have decreased; being 1,472 against 1,552 in the previous year. 265 deaths occurred of persons at and over 65 years of age; 137 died from 75 to 85; 36 from 85 to 95; and 6 deaths were registered at 95 and upwards; whilst in the previous year 278 died at 65 to 75; 186 from 75 to 85; 46 from 85 to 95 ; and one at 101. In infancy the largest number of deaths were caused by lung disease (241) comprising 92 from bronchitis; 67 from pneumonia; and 82 from other pulmonary affections. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility; 143 deaths; convulsions 79; whooping cough 53; premature birth 62; and diarrhoea 61. In old age 101 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 28 by heart disease; and 35 by paralysis; but the largest number, 231, was registered under the term of "old age." During the winter and spring months (December, January, February, and March,) of the year ending 25th March, 1883, there were 1,042 deaths registered, whilst in the corresponding months of the previous year there were 955 deaths. 67 ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 465 deaths—106 by whooping cough; 89 by diarrhœa; 123 by scarlet fever; 47 by measles; 20 by diptheria; and 80 by other zymotic diseases. 53 of the 106 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. 61 from the 89 deaths from diarrhœa occurred under one year. The influence of age is much more manifest, 83 of the 106 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years, and 76 of the 89 deaths from diarrhœa occurred in infants under two years of age. There was only one death from small-pox. Inspector Alexander's report tells that a great many improvements have been effected in the dwellings of the Parish; and it is evident from the nature of the alterations that they were calculated to promote health. In the report it is enumerated that— Drains have been repaired, relaid, or reconstructed and trapped in 479 premises. Stack pipes, which had allowed sewer gases to escape into dwellings, have been disconnected from drains in 367 premises. Waste pipes of sinks within doors (untrapped and permitting sewer gas to impregnate the dwellings) have been securely trapped, or disconnected from drains, and now have their ends in the open air, immediately over the yard sinks, in 312 premises. Water closets have been cleansed and repaired, and water laid on or restored in 709 premises. Yards have been paved or repaved with stone or cement concrete in 584 premises. 5,888 separate conditions, dangerous to health, were removed; and 934 dwellings were made more suitable for health, 68 The condition of the dwellings cannot be justly regarded apart from the daily wants of the people; and people's wants are clearest estimated by their difficulties and retardments. In these times it is not allowable to say that others must do what we do; every person has an inherent possession in his own life qualities, rendering it incumbent upon him to obtain his own advancement,—and progress depends on every one putting their shoulder to the wheel. Therefore the workman has to find a seasonable house to dwell in, and the Sanitary Authorities cannot close their eyes to the fact that railways, telegraph, cheaper postage, and foreign competition, &c., have made, and are yearly making, an immense difference to the industrial classes; and the increasing employment of machinery docs tend, or at least should tend, to awaken in their minds more and more the conviction that they will have to unfold and apply their faculties; thus, by seeing the working of the elementary powers, learn to know themselves. More particularly during the last twenty years, the Sanitary Authority of Shoreditch has witnessed an immense extension in the industrial operations throughout their Parish, and they now stand face to face with the question, What course would be best to take to further promote the abilities of the labouring class? More light, less smoke, and dwellings more conducive for "home" are urgently required. By "home " is understood, rest; and for rest there must be the conditions of stability, cleanliness, and sweetness. WATER SUPPLY. The "Constant Service" continues to work well, and the year shows more clearly its advantages over the old intermittent supply. Water-butts have, for the most part, been disused; and cisterns, so far as water for drinking purposes is concerned, are being disused. 69 Inspector Alexander's report records that water for drinking purposes has been supplied direct from the Water Companies' mains, instead of cisterns in 654 dwellings and instead of waterbutts in 24 premises. The New River Company now has had several year's experience of the working of the "Constant Supply" in Shoreditch, and I avail myself of this opportunity of stating, that they have expressed their desire to co-operate in an increasing degree with the Sanitary Authority in extending its usefulness throughout the Parish; and they have promptly acceeded to the request of your Medical Officer. DUST REMOVAL, SCAVENGING, AND WATERING ROADS. The Inspector has instituted improved registers that will facilitate enquiries into,—and that will enable the Vestry to judge of the work done. I am, Your obedient Servant, H. G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 71 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. St. Leonard, Shoreditch, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present the following Report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending 25th March, 1883, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. A special Report was presented to the Vestry with reference to the condition of the following houses, and in furtherance of an improvement scheme recommended by the Sanitary Committee. Jane Shore Court, Shoreditch 10 premises High Street Shoreditch 2 „ Ann's Place, Boundary Street 14 „ Boundary Street 5 „ House to house visitation, and special inspection with reference to complaints made in 967 premises Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 934 premises 72 WORKS DONE TO SECURE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.

MISCELLANEOUS. Over-crowding abated in 2 premises Water restored in 8 „ Additional water closet accommodation provided in 1 „ Urinals attached to public houses, re-constructed in 1 „ Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed from 7 „ Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 31 „ Making a total of 5,888 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, abated in 934 dwellings. 74 225 letters, in addition to ordinary notices have been addressed to owners of property, and many re-inspections had to bo made to ensure the work being done in a proper manner. A few cases are again detailed to show tho character of tho work that has been done. LANGBOURNE BUILDINGS, MODEL DWELLINGS.—in this block there are 90 separate suites of apartments arranged in pairs, for each pair there is one common water closet, situate in one common scullery external to living apartments. The closets were generally very foul, none being properly supplied with water, the cisterns in which drinking water was stored were all uncovered, placed over the water closets close to the ceilings and immediately under the closet of the apartments above, drinking water was thus not only exposed to contamination by odours and matters arising within the foul closets and sculleries in. which it was kept, but also from foul liquids dripping from the ceilings, caused by defective arrangements of tho closets above. Notices were served on the owner requiring the abatement of these nuisances, in compliance with which the whole of the cisterns have been removed, water is supplied direct from the main, and waste preventor cisterns have been supplied to each closet. ALBERT BUILDINGS, MODEL DWELLINGS.—In this block there are 54 suites of apartments, each suite has a separate water closet which is placed within the walls of the apartments. These closets were not provided with flushing apparatus. Water for drinking purposes was stored in cisterns placed on the roofs. The foul state of the water was much complained of by the tenants. On inspection the cisterns were found in a very filthy 75 condition. On ft subsequent inspection a, large quantity of foul black slimy matter that had been removed from the cisterns in process of cleansing was seen deposited on the flat roofs. The works required to be done, to secure the abatement of of these nuisances were considerably delayed by opposition on the part of the New River Company to the order directing water to be laid on from the main to each suite of apartments, this opposition being finally withdrawn each suite of apartments has now been fitted with water direct from the main, and with a good flushing supply of water to the water closets. Nos. 2 to 12, BOOKHAM STREET (11 houses).—These premises wero all found to be more or less infested with rats and consequently with sewer gas. It may be mentioned that one person complained that whilst sleeping in her bed she was attacked by rats. These conditions led to a thorough examination and rectification of the drains within the premises, and it was believed for a time that the nuisance was fully abated, until complaint was again made by one of the tenants that large numbers of rats were frequently seen in his front area, and that they were destroying the woodwork of the doorway in attempts to enter the house. An inspection of the premises led to the conclusion that they proceeded from some defect external to the house, this being represented to the Vestry's Surveyor an opening was made in the roadway, when it was found that the G" pipe drain coming from the house was connected into a 9" pipe drain going into the sewer; if the space between the sizes of the two pipes (3 inches) had ever been stopped with any material, it had been effectually removed by rats, who on leaving the drain had excavated for themselves a large commodious breeding place, from which runs extended to tho houses. 70 All the trouble, clangor and expense involved in this matter originated in the make-shift manner in which the 6" drain was jointed into the 9" and would have never havo arisen if a proper pipe had been used to connect the two (that is a tapering pipe moasuring 6'' at one end and 9" at the other. This was done by tho Surveyor's men and tho nuisance abated. LABUHNUM STREET, 50 to 82.—These houses were generally dirty and dilapidated, drains defective, water closets foul and dilapidated, not supplied with water, and though external to houses, so constructed as to bo very dark. The yards were in tho foulost condition, arising from defective paving and dilapidated dust bins. Tho back walls were soddened resulting from dofective rain water pipes, eaves gutters, and defective paving of yards. Water for drinking purposes was stored in cisterns placed on top of foul closets. The owners in compliance with tho Vestry's orders have oleansed and repaired tho interiors, ro-construoted tho drains throughout, water has been laid on to all the water closets, conorete floors provided and construction altered, so that each closet is now fully lighted. Water is laid on to each house direct from the main. The yards have been substantially paved oxtending outwards from the houses 10-ft., and fitted with properly dished and trapped sinks, at a level adapted for draining tho unpavod yards to tho roar (which were formerly ponds in wot weather), and an improved dust bin has been formed for each house. MARIA STREET. — Several cases of fever arising in these houses led to a house to house visitation, and tho discovery not only of very injurious surface conditions, including bad surface 77 drainage, foul closets without water, and water stored in butts, &c., but also defectively laid pipe drains, tho leakage from which drains soddened the ground throughout their course. There were also discovered 23 cesspools, each of them full of foecal matters and so situated as to leave little doubt that the atmosphere of the houses was from time to time impregnated with the gases arising from the decomposing filth. The whole of the cesspools have been thoroughly emptied, their contents carted away, and their space filled with lime rubbish. The drains have been properly re-constructed, the yards paved and properly dished and trapped sinks provided, the water closets have been properly re-constructed, concrete floors provided and water laid on throughout, improved dust bins provided to each house, and water laid on from the main throughout. No Police Court Summonses for the abatement of nuisances have been taken out during the year. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. ALEXANDER, Sanitary Inspector. . 79 INSPECTOR FLETCHER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to Report that during the year ending March 25th, 1883, the conditions named below have caused nuisances dangerous to health, and were inspected and remedied under my supervision:— Accumulation of dung, removed from 9 premises „ refuse from 4 „ Dung pits provided in 3 „ Private urinals cleansed and repaired in 2 „ Water closet cleansed and repaired in 1 „ Water laid on and reinstated in 13 „ Yard paving relaid and sink provided in 1 „ Courts paved and drained in 3 „ Overcrowding abated in 5 „ Dirty rooms cleansed in 1 „ Smoke nuisances abated in 3 „ Pigs removed from 4 „ Corpses decomposing, removed from 6 „ Minor nuisances (not referred to Inspector Alexander) little alteration needed in 2 „ NUISANCES DANGEROUS TO HEALTH CONSEQUENT ON INFECTIOUS DISEASES.—The following details show the Sanitary measures adopted where cases of contagious diseases occurred: — Number of houses inspected and disinfected. 347 Notices served requiring owners and occupiers to disinfect articles, &c., liable to retain infection in 347 premises 80 483 cases of contagious diseases were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 30 were cases of small-pox. 23 of the small-pox cases were removed to Hospital, 6 were not removed and 1 died. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses. Number of infected beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven during the above period 158 Ditto pillows ditto 296 Ditto mattrasses ditto 94 Ditto bolsters ditto 67 Ditto other articles ditto 1,027 Making a total of 1,642 articles disinfected. ARTICLES OF FOOD, &c., condemned and destroyed by me as being unfit for human consumption :— 3 trunks of plaice. 156 rabbits. 7 lobsters. 2 boxes of bloaters. 5 dozen haddocks. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.—See Analyst's Report. REMOVAL OF DUST.—During the year ending 25th March, 1883, the dust on the whole has been fairly removed from the Parish, and there has been a slight decrease in the number of applications for removal of duet from private dwellings than in the previous year. The number of applications during the past year, compared with the number of applications during the previous three years is shown below:— Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1882-3 753 5 0 1017 11 0 In the previous three years the average number was— 1305 8 0 1295 5 0 81 The removal of dust from the Parish has been fairly attended to. The number of complaints have been reduced by 452 in the Eastern and 225 in the Western Division during the past year as compared with the previous year. SCAVENGING.— The cleansing of the streets and gullies have been better attended to than in the previous years. There are about 1,633 gullies in the Parish (776 in the Eastern and 857 in the Western). WATERING THE ROADS.— The system of hiring the vans, carts, men, &c., to water the roads and streets, under the supervision of the Vestry's Officers has worked satisfactorily. I may further state that giving the horse hire to a person having stables within the Parish has facilitated the work of watering. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. R. FLETCHER, Inspector.
