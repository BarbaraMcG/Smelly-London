Fisher and Parrish, the Contractors to the North Metropolitan Tramway Company, having written requesting the Board to consent to their using 3×7 sets throughout the District between the metal- instead of 4×7 from the junction of East India Dock Road as arranged, the Board agreed to the 3×7 sets being used as requested.

The sum of £18,000 has been borrowed from the London Life Association for the cost of the paving works, to be repayable in 20 years by equal annual instalments, and to bear interest payable half-yearly at 4½ per cent. per annum. Application has been made by the Engineer of the North Metro- politan Tramways Company, requesting the Board to consent to the extension eastward of the double line of tramway in the Commercial Road over the Britannia Bridge to a point opposite the east side of Church Row, and the consent of the Board has been given upon condition that the Company pay to the Board the sum of £150, which amount has been paid. With regard to the future repairing and maintaining the Commercial Road, I have arranged a new line of boundary in such road, between the Hamlet of Rateliff and the Hamlet of Mile End Old Town, for such purpose, with the Surveyor of Mile End Old Town, and an order of apportionment has been made by the Metropolitan Board of Works, according to such plan. In reference to the widening of the Bridges over the Regent's Canal, in Narrow Street, by the Regent's Canal Company, the Company having submitted a plan to the Metropolitan Board of Works, in accordance with the terms of their Act of 1865, to widen Narrow Street over the entrances to Barge Lock and Old Ship Lock, for 30 and feet respectively, a letter was addressed to thin Board by the Metropolitan Board of Works upon the subject, suggesting that the full width of 30 feet should be maintained over both entrances, and this Board, having considered the matter, found that the Company were not bound by their Act of Parliament to construct the bridges more than 25 feet wide, and a letter was addressed by the Board to the Company to the effect that the Board do not consider it expedient to incur any cost in increasing the width of the bridge over the Old Ship entrance at Narrow Street beyond the width required by the Act of Parliament. In reference to the Tunnel constructed by the Regent's Canal Company under Narrow Street, Limehouse, the Company not having filled in such Tunnel, in accordance with a notice served upon them by the Board, the opinion of Counsel was taken upon the matter, and in accordance with the instructions of the Board 1 have had the Tunnel filled in. A letter has since been received from the Secretary of the Company protesting against the Act. In reference to the erection of Stairs by the Regents Canal Company, in lieu of Kidney Stairs, notice has been served by the Board upon the Company requiring them to provide New Stairs as provided by their Act of Parliament. A letter has been received by the Board from the Company's Engineer stating that the Thames Conservancy had approved of plans of and Approaches proposed to be constructed by the Company at the western side of the Old Ship entrance, in addition to those already erected and adjacent to the "David and Harp." The proposed Staris and Approaches not being in accordance with the requirements the Company's Act of Parliament, a letter has been addressed by order the Board, to the Conservators of the River Thames, objecting to the proposed landing place, and requesting that their consent be not given, and the Board have ordered proceedings to be taken to complete the Company to comply with the terms of their Act of Parliament. A communication having been received by this Board, from the Vestry of the Parish of Shoreditch as to the desirability of widening and improving the Bridges over the Canals on the north side of the Thames, and forwarding a copy of a resolution passed by that Vestry, to make application to the Metropolitan Board requesting them to endeavour to obtain parliamentary powers to widen and improve existing Bridges, and to construct new Bridges where necessary, a letter was addressed by order of the Board, to the Metropolitan Board of Works in support of the application made by the Vestry of Shoreditch, and a reply was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works to the effect that that Board had resolved to adjourn the consideration of the question of the Canal Bridges until the month of July, 1873. With regard to the north parapet wall of the Bridge over the Regents Canal, in Salmon Lane, in pursuance of the directions of the Board, I prepared a plan for raising such wall, and submitted the same to the Regents Canal Company, who approved thereof, and the work has been done. Notice has been given by the London and Blackwall Railway Company of their intended application to Parliament, and plans deposited, for power to authorize certain works to improve the Stepney Station, and the Railway and works at and near the Station; also to make and maintain a Railway in Limehouse, commencing by a junction with the Bow Extension Railway, near the Regents Canal, and terminating by a junction with the London and Blackwall Railway at or near Island Row. A Petition has been presented in opposition to the above Bill and Clauses prepared for insertion therein to protect the interests of the Board. Proposed Widening oo Thoroughfare from Wapping Bridge Westward, to Little Tower Hill—The Metropolitan Board of Works have obtained an Act of Parliament empowering them to make this and other Improvements as Metropolitan Improvements. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board.
