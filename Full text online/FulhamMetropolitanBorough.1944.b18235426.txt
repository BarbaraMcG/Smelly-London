LIBRARY Ful 35 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FULHAM REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the year 1944 P.L.T. BENNETT, M.C., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., T.D.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FULHAM Public Health Department, Town Hall, Fulham, S.W.6. September, 1945. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for the year 1944 on behalf of Dr. J.A. Scott under whose direction the work of the Health Department was carried out. Dr. Scott left Fulham early in January, 1945, after having served the Council as Medical Officer of Health since 1935â€¢ His tenure of office coincided with a very strenuous period, both in the history of the Borough of Fulham and that of the nation for following the threatening aspect of international relations in 1938 the storm burst in 1939; and at the time of Dr. Scott's departure to take up the office of a Principal Medical Officer under the London County Council early in this year the war was still in progress. During his term of office many important local developments in health activities took place - chiefly in the direction of housing and clearance, the opening of the Borough Maternity Home, the inception of a part-time Foot Clinic and the further expansion of the Child Welfare Services. The staff of the Department will remember, with much appreciation, many acts of kindness and consideration which Dr. Scott was always willing to render to those in need. Another member of the staff who will be much missed is Mr. A.T. Hurford, the Chief Clerk and Vaccination Officer, who retired in December after 40 years' honourable service in the Department. Mr. Hurford has seen the Department grow from very small beginnings and has taken his full share in the development of the many activities now carried on. During the year under review the calls of Civil Defence made many heavy demands upon the staff of the department - particularly during the blitz period early in the year and the long spell of flying bomb activity which commenced in June. It was therefore inevitable that the normal work should suffer to some extent by delay or the temporary suspension of activity: and in this connection I have to record with much regret that the Fulham Babies' Hospital in Broomhouse Road was badly damaged and put out of action by a flying bomb explosion in its vicinity at the end of July. Fortunately no casualties occurred amongst the inmates or staff of the hospital. At the present time the building is being repaired and when it is possible to re-open will fill a much needed gap .in the services of the Borough Council. Tuberculosis - Memorandum 266T. The allowance scheme (first started in June, 1943) has been carried on throughout the year and it is now possible to make some kind of estimate of its value. Under the scheme, for the benefit of those who may not be familiar with its essentials, I would state briefly that monetary allowances are provided for certain cases who have to stop working (on doctor's advice) in order to undergo treatment for the disease, and in whom there is a reasonable chance of eventual restoration to good working capacity by the treatment. It will EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR. POPULATION, estimated, 1944 95,090 Rate per 1,000 of Population. LIVE BIRTHS: Total Males Females Legitimate 1587 758 829 16.7 Illegitimate 175 95 80 1.8 1762 853 909 18.5 STILLBIRTHS: Legitimate 34 17 17 0.36 Illegilimate 8 6 2 0.08 42 23 19 0.44 1578 778 800 16.6 DEATHS: Percentage of deaths in public institutions 52 Deaths from puerperal causes: From sepsis. From other causes. 2 Number of deaths. - Rate per 1,000 (Live and Still) births. - 1.11 Death Rate of Infants Under One Year of Age: All Infants per 1,000 live births 43 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate births 40 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate births 63 Deaths from: Cancer (all ages) 210 Measles (all ages) Whooping Cough (all ages) - 5 Diarrhoea (under two years of age) 14 CLASSIFICATION OF CAUSES OF DEATH: The Registrar-General classifies the 1,578 deaths as follows: Cerebro-spinal fever 2; Whopping Cough 5; Tuberculosis of respiratory system 75; Other forms of tuberculosis 4; Syphilitic disease 15; Influenza 9; Poliomyelitis 1; Acute encephalitis lethargica 2; Cancer of (a) buccal cavity 11; (b) uterus 13; (c) stomach and duodenum 35; (d) breast 24; other sites 127; Diabetes 7; Intracranial lesions 112; Heart Diseases 381; Other diseases of circulatory system 45; Bronchitis 86; Pneumonia 79; Other respiratory diseases 13; Ulcer of stomach or duodenum2l; Diarrhoe (under 2 yrs.) 14; Appendicitis 4; Other digestive diseases 29; Nephritis 43; Other Maternal causes2; Premature birth 15; Congenital malformations etc. 21; Suicide 10; Road traffic accidents 10; Other violent causes 269; All other causes 94. It will be seen that five causes accounted for 60 per cent of the total deaths, namely Heart diseases, Cancer, Respiratory diseases, intra-cranial lesions and Tuberculosis (all forms) therefore be seen that some difficulty may arise in the interpretation of the second provision, as the possibility of a large number of cases, more or less of chronic type, might have to be excluded as well as thos of non-pulmonary disease (which is specified in the memorandum). The Tuberculosis Officer has to give the medical "verdict" and in Fulham cases have always been dealt with in as lenient a manner as possible, whilst still carrying out the intention of the memorandum and-actually no real difficulty appears to have been experienced. In assessing the value of this allowance scheme after about 18 months of its operation the opinion may be expressed that not only are the allowances on the meagre side in comparison with Public Assistance, but that the scheme should be considerably widened to include all cases. As a wartime measure it is undoubtedly a big step in the right direction and no doubt full consideration on the lines indicated above will be given to the betterment of the scheme in post war reconstruction. Miniature Mass Radiography. A further new development of preventive medicine was inaugurated early in 1944, when the London County Council miniture mass radiography unit carried out the first periodic survey at St. Luke's Hospital (Chelsea) Centre. This was within easy distance of the Borough of Fulham and a total of sixteen hundred ana seventy-six individuals employed in the area were dealt with at the centre. From this unit (and from other centres operating elsewhere towards the end of the year) thirty cases were sent to the Tuberculosis Officer for further investigation and a total of one hundred attendances were made at the Dispensary, nine cases eventually being notified as suffering from tuberculosis. In accordance with instructions this Report is prepared on the lines of that for 1943 and is therefore in an abbreviated form, though some restrictions relating to vital statistics which were previously imposed have now been lifted. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P.L.T. BENNETT M.C., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., T.D.D., D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. INFANTILE DEATHS.

The latter Nursery was temporarily closed owing to the distance between the Nursery and the Air Raid Shelter. Between them the six nurseries provided accommodation for 315 children. The construction of another nursery for 72 children was nearing completion when the building sustained damage from enemy action and eventually the site was handed over to the Ministry of Works.
