The death-rate of Islington during the past year has been 16.9 per 1,000 of the population. There has been a total of 5,229 deaths recorded in the Parish, of which 2,597 were males and 2,G32 females. I have adopted for statistical purposes the four Registration Districts into which the Parish has now been divided, and both the births and deaths have been tabulated in accordance with the new arrangement. Of the 5,229 total deaths registered in Islington, 1,086 occurred in Upper Holloway, 1,840 in Islington South West, 961 in Islington South East, and 742 in Highbury. The actual number of deaths this year is rather more than the total number of the previous year, but taking the increase of the population into account, the death-rate of 16.9 per 1,000 is the lowest to be found upon our Islington records. It is noteworthy that it occurs in conjunction with an abnormally low birth rate. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. In the following table I have arranged according to ages the deaths that have taken place in Islington from the year 1880 to 1884, inclusive :— 1880 1881 1882 1883 1884 Under 1 year old 1,517 1,400 1,403 1,312 1,506 From 1 to 2 years 521 480 488 512 494 „ 2 to 3 „ 194 218 243 213 201 „ 3 to 4 „ 131 117 132 111 131 „ 4 to 5 „ 102 94 118 91 88 „ 5 to 10 „ 176 148 188 168 168 „ 10 to 15 „ 66 59 65 68 60 „ 15 to 20 „ 92 82 89 82 85 „ 20 to 40 „ 529 645 569 572 579 „ 40 to 60 „ 799 742 765 774 780 ,, 60 to 80 „ 961 913 987 999 916 „ 80 and upwards 198 218 217 238 221 Table No. IV.

The deaths referred to Diarrhoea as well as to diseases of the digestive organs and to violence were also in excess, whilst on the other hand the number of deaths attributable to diseases of the respiratory organs was very much below that of any year since 187G. Smll-pox was severely epidemic throughout the year, increasing in its intensity towards the close. Out of 608 cases of sickness from Small-pox recorded during 1884 in the Sanitary Department, there were 97 deaths. 36 of these deaths were registered in the parish (including those which happened in the Highgate Hospital), and 61 deaths occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Tables will be found further on showing the progress of the disease during 1884 and the first six months of the current year The highest number of cases were recorded in January and February, 1885. Measles was again epidemic but not in its severest form, 125 deaths only having occurred, as against 165, 153, 161, 48, and 219 in the five previous years. Diphtheria was seriously epidemic within a limited area, and caused 114 deaths. 79 of the deaths were registered in the Eastern portion of the Upper Hlloway district, the epidemic having also affected the more sparsely populated districts upon its Northern and Eastern outlying borders. The deaths from Diphtheria in the three previous years were 70, 54, 42. Scarlatina caused only 57 deaths, against 95, 142, 116, 198, 135, 173, 200, 125, 222 and 129 in the previous ten years. The small area in which Diphtheria was so very prevalent was apparently little affected by Scarlatina, which caused only 7 deaths in the district, as against 79 attributable to Diphtheria. In the other registration districts there were 29,13 and 8 deaths from Scarlatina respectively, as against 20, 9, and 6 deaths from Diphtheria. 10 Whooping Cough was severely epidemic throughout the parish, but was chiefly prevalent during the first seven months of the year. The deaths registered reached the high number of 268 as against 119, 299, and 172 in the three previous years. Diarrhoea caused 266 deaths, as against 162, 149, 216, 295, and 104 in the five previous years. The deaths occurred as usual chiefly in the months of July, August and September, and were more generally distributed in proportion to the population than in the case of some of the other Zymotic diseases. To Fever generally 83 deaths were referred, as against 86, 77, and 79 in the three previous years. SMALL-POX EPIDEMIC.

MARY ISLINGTON. Gentlemen,— Your Sanitary. Committee report:— 1.—That pursuant to the Vestry reference of the 7th November, 1884, they have taken into consideration the communication received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, together with the report of the Board's General Purposes Committee with reference to the reception and treatment of non-pauper cases of infectious disease at the hospitals of the managers. In reviving the discussion upon this subject, the Board have recapitulated the arguments previously used to show the desirability of enlarged powers being granted them as a central authority, and of their providing the requisite hospital accommodation for all cases of dangerous infectious disease ocurring in the metropolis. To these two propositions the Vestry and your Committee have already assented in prineiple, the more especially as regards the latter, it being the opinion of your committee that the Board were originally constituted for the purpose of making the provision referred to. The Board, however, in further announcing their readiness to receive all classes of infected patients, states that—" The Local Government " Board will be requested to place themselves in communication with " the several Local Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis, with the " view of issuing an order which shall empower the Managers (in " accordance with the terms of Section 15 of the Poor Law Act, 1879*) " to contract with such authorities for the reception into the Managers' " hospitals of cases of dangerous infectious disorder, other than those " chargeable to the various Parishes and Unions." This proposal means (if such contracts be entered into) that the maintenance of the greater proportion of the patients (over 90 per cent. according to a previous report of the Managers), now admitted to the infectious hospitals upon the order of the Relieving Officers, * See Note A, page 15. 13 shall in future become chargeable to the Sanitary Authorities, to the great relief of the Common Poor Fund, those persons only who are actually known to have received parochial relief being recognised by the Poor Law Authorities as rightly chargeable to the Guardians as pauper patients. Your Committee, on the other hand, have always contended that all patients who themselves are unable to pay, or whose friends cannot pay, for their admission to the Highgate Small-pox Hospital, or the London Fever Hospital, are entitled as necessitous persons to admission and treatment at the hospitals of the Board at the expense of the Poor Rate. Your Committee therefore:— Recommend the Vestry, that a reply be sent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board agreeing generally with the conclusions contained in Paragraphs (a), (b), (c),* of their Committee's Report, but dissenting from the view that any necessity exists for a change being made in the mode of admitting persons suffering from infectious disease into the Hospitals of the Board, or in respect to the chargeability of the patients whose maintenance at present is, in the opinion of the Vestry, very properly thrown upon the Common Poor Fund of the Metropolis. II.—Your Committee have also considered the communication received from the Vestry of Kensington, and the accompanying Report of their Medical Officer of Health, both of which relate to the subject already referred to in this Report—viz., the admission of non-pauper cases of infectious disease into the Hospitals of the Asylums Board. The proposals of the Kensington Vestry are, however, more startling in their character than the milder suggestions of the Asylums Board, for, with the exception of paragraph A, † which simply desires that the Board may be empowered to provide Hospital accommodation for infected patients of all classes, the gist of the several other paragraphs, marked "(b),(c),(d),(e)," of the Kensington Report, is the desirability, in their opinion, of the transference of all the expenses incident to the maintenance and treatment in the Hospitals of the Asylums Board of every case of infectious disease which may arise, from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund to a * See Note B, page 15. † See Note C, page 16. 14 "Common Sanitary Fund," to be specially created by Act of Parliament, for the purpose of bearing this novel burden. Further, the Kensington Vestry have invited the Managers of the Board " to consider " the greater simplicity and advantages of this plan as compared vith "their proposal to contract separately with the several Sanitary "Authorities," and the advisability of legislation to give effect to such plan is also suggested. The Kensington Vestry conclude by stating that they have resolved to address the Local Government Board upon this subject, and your Yestry are requested " to take into consideration the "desirability of supporting their recommendations in favour of " throwing the entire cost of the Hospitals of the Asylums Board on " what may ~be called a Sanitary Common Fund." Your Committee therefore:— Recommend that a reply be sent to the Kensington Vestry agreeing only in respect to the Paragraph marked A, in communication of the 20th November, 1884, and expressing the Vestry's dissent from the principles laid down in the Paragraphs marked B, C, D, E, and also strongly protesting against such a change as that of throwing the entire cost of the maintenance of the Hospitals of the Asylums Board upon a Metropolitan Common Sanitary Fund as being unjust in principle, and as likely to prove the greatest possible encouragement to increased extravagance by a Board always remarkable for lavish expenditure. All which is submitted. HENRY QUILTER, Chairman Sanitary Committee. Vestry Offices, Upper Street, 19th January, 1885. 15 A. Extract from the "Poor Law Act, 1879." Section 15.—The Metropolitan Asylums Board may, from time to time, with the approval of the Local Government Board, contract with any local authority in the metropolis acting in the execution of the Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same, for the reception and maintenance in any hospital belonging to or under the management of such Board, or any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder within the district of any such local authority, and any person received into an hospital by virtue of any such contract under this section shall be deemed to be maintained in such hospital by the local authority with whom the contract is made. Any expenses incurred oy a local authority for the maintenance of any person under this section, shall be deemed to be due from such person to the local authority, and may be recovered by the local authority from him, or from his representatives, at any time within six months after his discharge from such hospital. B. Extract from the Special Report of the General Purposes Committee of the Asylums Board on the Question of the Reception and Treatment of Non-Pauper Patients at the Managers' Hospitals. (a) That such provision could be best made in a comprehensive and systematic manner by one Central Authority acting for the whole metropolis, not only for vauper patients, but for other classes desirous of hospital accommodation. (b) That such Central Authority should not be merely a Department of Poor Law Administration, but should have the pavers of the Sanitary Acts conferred upon it. (c) That either the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be merged into such Central Authority, or should itself be that Authority, in which case its constitution should be altered and adapted to its enlarged duties and responsibilities. 16 C. Extbact from the Communication of the Kensington Vestry, Dated the 20th November, 1884, upon the Subject of the Hospital Treatment of Non-Pauper Cases of Infectious Disease. (a) That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be empowered to make adequate provision of hospital accommodation for infectious disease for all classes of the population in need of such accommodation. (b) That patients should be admitted into the Managers' hospitals upon certificates signed by any duly qualified medical practitioner. (c) That as the hospitals of the Managers have been established for the common good at the public cost, no compulsory payment should be exacted from persons whom the Sanitary Authority may deem it necessary or expedient to remove to the hospitals for the purpose of isolation. (d) That all expenses incident to the maintenance and treatment of such persons in the hospitals should be defrayed out of a Common Sanitary Fund, the Metropolis being treated for the purpose as a single district, and (e) That steps should be taken to alter, by Act of Parliament, the constitution of the Board, by severing its connection with pauperism in so far as relates to the treatment of infectious disease, and by providing for the election of a certain proportion of the Managers by the several Sanit try Authorities, i.e., the Vestries and District Boards of Works. 17 WATER ANALYSIS.

During the twelve months ending December, 1884, I examined 115 samples of food, 113 of which were submitted to me by your Inspectors and 2 by the public, to wit, the Guardians of the Parish. This makes in all 1,351 samples of food examined for Islington since my appointment. The 113 samples submitted by your Inspectors consisted of:— 4 Milk 4 Chicory 4 Port Wine 4 Black Tea 4 Gin 4 Green Tea 4 Brandy 4 Moist Sugar 4 Rum 4 Mustard 4 Whisky 4 White Pepper 4 Fourpenny Ale 4 Cayenne Pepper 4 Porter 4 Lard 4 Bread 4 Flour 8 Butter 4 Oatmeal 4 Cheese 4 Pickles 5 Arrowroot 4 Mixed Sweets 4 Cocoa 4 Lime Juice 4 Coffee Of the 113 samples submitted by your Inspectors I found none adulterated or containing injurious admixture. The two samples submitted by the Guardians were both Milk, one of which I certified to be genuine, and the other as adulterated with 37 per cent. of water. I have further, in an Appendix attached hereto, published in extenso, for the information of the Vestry, my four Quarterly Reports as Analyst, together with their accompanying Schedules, and for further details I refer the reader to these reports. 20 THE MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT, 1884. From the 1st January to the 31st December, 1884, 659 bodies were received at the Mortuary, the daily average being 1.8. 366 inquests have been held during the same period, the sum of £55 12s. 6d. having been paid to the Vestry for the accommodation afforded by the Coroner's Court. The proportion of inquests to deaths was about 7 per cent. for the whole year. SANITARY WORK OF THE YEAR, 1884—85. Table No. VI. This table of our Sanitary work has been prepared in the usual manner, showing in the upper portion the number and variety of the inspections, reinspections, and calls made by the District Inspectors during the year, and in the lower portion the amendments effected. In addition, the District Inspectors have also reported the premises from which they have found removal of dust to be necessary. By the authority of the Sanitary Committee, carbolic acid was again used during the summer months in watering some of the streets. McDougall's Powder was also used in the hottest and driest part of the season in the courts, and in connection with the Sunday morning cleansing of the channels of the Essex, Caledonian, and Holloway roads, where these thoroughfares are used as market-places until late on Saturday night. It will be seen from this table that a much larger number of inspections were made and corresponding improvements effected than usual, notwithstanding the epidemics of Small-pox and Diphtheria, the excess being chiefly due to the fact that an extra temporary Inspector was employed in the work during the last nine months of the year. THE SLAUGHTER AND COW HOUSES IN ISLINGTON, 1884—85. At the Annual Licensing of 1884, there were 79 applications for renewal of licences to Slaughter-houses, 78 being granted. The applicant in one case not being in attendance the licence lapsed. 21 For the renewal of licences to Cow-houses, 41 applications were made, and all were granted. One fresh application for a licence to a new Cow-house was also made, and was granted conditionally. 78 Slaughter-houses and 42 Cow-houses were therefore licensed. My annual inspection of these places, prior to the licensing, proved them to be in a satisfactory condition. SUMMONSES. During the year ending 25th March, 1885, five summonses were issued by direction of the Sanitary Committee. Two were for the recovery of the cost of disinfection incurred by the Vestry in default of the owners complying with the usual notices, but both the amounts 18s. and £117s. 6d. respectively, were paid, together with 2s. costs in each case, before the summonses could be heard. Two summonses were issued on account of defective drainage, and in the one case the required works were carried out and the summons was withdrawn on the payment of 2s. costs. In the second case the magistrate made an order for the abatement of the nuisance and the execution of the necessary works, and this order having been disobeyed, penalties amounting to £5 and 4s. costs were inflicted upon the owner, when the work was done and the penalties paid. The fifth summons, which was also issued under the Nuisances Removal Acts, was one of a rather unusual character, the cause of the nuisance being mainly, if not altogether, in the district of Saint Pancras, whilst the nuisance, in effect, was obviously in Islington, from the flow of sewage over the Brecknock Road within the Islington boundary. The Nuisance was created by a builder who had leased land in Saint Pancras and had re-let it for building purposes, he himself being under covenant to the freeholders to construct the necessary main sewers and to make the roads. A new street called Lupton Street was formed, in which he constructed a 12-inch pipe drain which became an elongated cesspool, from the fact that no proper outlet had been provided. In order to connect this intended sewer, which he had brought a few feet within the Islington boundary, with the main drainage of the Metropolis, it 22 was absolutely necessary that it should be continued across the Brecknock Road and connected with a large sewer in the Southcote Road, which had been constructed at the expense of private individuals, the constructors being entitled to a contribution towards its cost from parties requiring to make a connection with it, and this contribution the Saint Pancras builder was determined not to pay. When the sewage burst up in the roadway the builder put in a straight pipe to conduct the sewage to the surface, and thence he formed a rubble drain in the old road-side watercourse throngh which the sewage made its way until it reached a gully connected with an Islington sewer. Under the Nuisances Removal Acts the Local Authority are bound to proceed first against the person by whose act, default or sufferance, the nuisance arises or continues, or if such person cannot be found or ascertained, against the owner or occupier of the premises on which the nuisance arises. The flow of sewage arose without doubt in certain houses in Lupton Street, which had become occupied and had drains connecting them with the elongated cesspool, but being within the district of Saint Pancras, the Islington Vestry could exercise no jurisdiction as against either the owners or the occupiers of those premises. This difficulty in repect to jurisdiction precluded also the possibility of our proceeding against the Saint Pancras Authorities, although upon the construction of the intended sewer it had become without doubt vested in the Vestry of Saint Pancras, and their neglect in not enforcing the provision of a proper outlet, and in allowing houses to be occupied without proper drainage, might have been alleged as the causes of the nuisance. In a well-known case, R. v. Cotton, 1 E. & E. 203, it was determined that the jurisdiction of justices only arises where both the cause and effect of the nuisance are within the area of the same Local Authority. The defect was remedied by the 108th section of the "Public Health Act," 1875, so far as the Sanitary Districts outside the Metropolis are concerned, and there is no doubt that this restriction will be shortly removed by the Legislature as regards the Metropolis. In the meantime, however, we had no alternative but to endeavour to fix the offence upon the builder, who had constructed the drain, as the person 23 by whose act in the making of the drain, by whose default in not providing a proper outlet, and by whose sufferance in allowing the houses in Lupton Street to be drained into it, the nuisance had been created and continued. The case was proved, and the Defendant was ordered " to abate the nuisance, and to do all such acts and things as were necessary for that purpose.'" Having failed to comply with the Magistrate's order, the Defendant was summoned for disobedience and fined £3 with £2 2s. costs, and the payment of these sums was enforced ; but having been summoned a second time, penalties amounting to £5 were imposed, with £2 2s. costs, and against this conviction the Defendant appealed to Quarter Ssssions, the appeal causing a further delay of three months. A conditional order having, however, been made by the Court, the Defendant at once carried out the necessary work, and paid a contribution of £30 to the constructors of the sewer in Southcote Road, that sum having been fixed by the Metropolitan Board of Works as the amount to be paid by the Saint Pancras Vestry to the Vestry of Islington; the necessary connection between the Lupton Street sewer (in Saint Pancras) and the Southcote Road sewer (in Islington), having been made the subject of an administrative order by the Metropolitan Board of Works, upon the application of the Yestry of Islington. The final settlement on this appeal, and the question of costs still remain in abeyance, and will do so until the October Quarter Sessions. THE DWELLINGS OF THE POOR. Of late the subject of the Dwellings of the Poor has excited considerable attention, a great deal having been written both of a praiseworthv as well as of a sensational and impracticable character. It has, however, resulted in the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the Housing of the Working Classes, and the first Report of the Commissioners is now before the public. I do not intend to discuss in detail this Report of the Commission, it having been already considered by a Committee and reported upon to the Vestry. I may, however, remark that the Report contains much that is both fallacious and misleading. This is scarcely to be wondered at, considering 24 the nature of the evidence which was taken, more especially as regards the Sanitary administration of several of the Metropolitan Districts. Some of the recommendations of the Commissioners also, if carried into effect, would be utterly subversive of Local Self-Government and of local self-respect, as the Local Government Board, who already have almost absolute control of the Poor Law administration of the Metropolis, Mould be further empowered to meddle with and control all Sanitary matters, to the virtual extinction of all freedom of action on the part of the present Local Authorities. On the other hand, the Report contains some useful information, and a few practical suggestions which have reference chiefly to certain necessary changes in the Sanitary Acts relating to the Metropolis. Alterations in the direction indicated would, I believe, prove beneficial in their action and helpful to the Sanitary Administrators of this vast city. One of the suggested amendments is in connection with the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Acts, 1808 and 1879 (Torrens' Acts), the recommendation being to expunge by legislation the compensation clause from the Act of 1879 which confers upon owners the right of requiring the Vestries and District Boards to purchase any properties ordered by them either to be demolished or to be repaired, the result being the compulsory purchase of worthless property at a large cost by the Local Authority. The compensation clauses were originally incorporated in the Act of 1879 in consequence of the excuse very generally made by the Vestries and District Boards, that the enforcement of the demolition of property without compensation, as provided for by the Act of 1868, was simply confiscation, and that the infliction of such gross injustice had prevented them from enforcing this provision of the Act. By a singular coincidence, however, it was owing to the removal of this alleged injustice by the provision for compensation, as contained in the Act of 1879, (which, it is quite true, unfortunately gives a premium to the owners of neglected property at the expense of the Ratepayers of the District) that the Vestry were led, during the year, to decline to make orders under these Acts in relation to the following properties, in respect to which I had deemed it right to initiate proceedings by reporting the whole of the 76 houses in accordance with the 5th section of the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings' Acts, 1868, as being in a condition or state dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation. 25 DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.

Total 76 As regards the properties numbered 1 to 11, consisting of 65 houses, your Surveyor, Mr. Higgins, to whom my reports were referred in the usual course, reported that in his opinion they were incapable of structural improvement and should be demolished, and in this opinion Mr. Collingwood and myself most fully concurred. The properties numbered 12 and 13, consisting of 7 houses, were reported as being fit for certain structural alterations and repairs, and the requisite works were duly set forth. In respect to the property numbered 14, no report from the Surveyor was laid before the Vestry. The Vestry, however, determined not to make any order with reference to the several properties under these Special Acts, in consequence of the compensation clauses already referred to which would have been applicable to all the houses, if the Vestry had ordered them either to be demolished or to be repaired. 26 Upon staying these proceedings, the Vestry referred my reports and those of the Surveyor to a Special Committee, composed of the Sanitary Committee and the Chairman of the other permanent Committees, who, having inspected the houses, directed that proceedings should be taken under the Nuisances Removal Acts, with a view to the closing of the houses as unfit for human habitation, pending the execution of such structural and other works as were necessary to render them fairly habitable. 62 Summonses were therefore issued in respect to the same number of houses, and of these 35 were ordered to be closed and repaired, and 27 to be repaired without closing. 33 of these houses have since been generally repaired and improved, 29 being still closed, but of which 4 are now being repaired. Of the other 14 houses reported, numbered 10, 11, 13 and 14 respectively (all of which were dealt with by representation to the Owners without summonses being issued) 9 have been repaired, 4 are being repaired, and 1 is being demolished. The repairs and alterations which have been effecte.d will no doubt conduce, for the time being, to the comfort of the occupiers, but it is scarcely to be expected that the works carried out will prove to be of so permanent a character as could be desired in respect to those of the houses which were recommended for demolition as being incapable of structural improvement. REGISTRATION OF HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, &c. The Special Committee already referred to, dealt also with the question of the Registration of Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and a copy of the Regulations made with respect to such houses by the Vestry, and confirmed by the Local Government Board, under the provisions of the 35th Section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the 47th Section of the Sanitary Laws Amendment Act, 1874, is appended hereto. The necessary Registration of each house and room and the enforcement of these Regulations will entail a largely increased amount of extra work upon the Sanitary Department of your Vestry, and it is very doubtful whether the results will prove to be in any way commensurate, either to the work which will be involved or to the expectations of those who have anticipated the accomplishment of great things by means of the Regulations which are now being put in force. 27 THE DUSTING OF THE PARISH, 1884—85. I have appended, as usual, a tabulated statement (Table No. VII.) of the applications for the removal of Dust during the year ending Lady-Day, 1885, showing the number received during each quarter from the eight different Wards of the Parish. Of the total number of 10,211 applications received from residents during the year, 7,067 were by letter or postal card, and 3,144 were made personally, or by messengers sent to the Vestry Offices. The 10,211 applications received from inhabitants were at the rate of 25'8 per cent. of the 39,406 assessments in the Parish. Mr. Collingwood and myself desire to express our satisfaction with the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. Of Mr. Colling wood's own labours, they are, in my judgment, beyond praise. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, C. MEYMOTT TIDY, M.B., Medical Officer of Health. 30th June, 1885. TABLE No. V.
