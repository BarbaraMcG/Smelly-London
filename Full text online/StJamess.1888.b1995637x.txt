In accordance with the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the Vestry present the following Report of their proceedings and an abstract of their accounts for the twelve months ended the 25th March last; also a statement of Contracts entered into or in force during; that time' and the liabilities of the Vestry at the end thereof, together with the Report of their Surveyor for the same period, and of their Medical Officer of Health for the year 1888. With a view to affording the ratepayers as complete a knowledge as possible of the administration of parochial affairs generally, the Vestry have appended to their Report, Statements of Accounts relating to the Guardians'of the Westminster Union, the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, and the Trustees of Charitable Endowments in which the parish is interested. 14 THE PARISH. Extent.—The Parish occupies an area of 164 acres. It has about 12½ miles of streets, of which miles are paved with wood, 5 with asphalte, 1 with pitching, 1½ with macadam, and mile consists of courts, yards, and passages. Population.—At the last census, which was taken in April, 1881, the resident population was ascertained to he 29,865 persons, and the number of occupied houses 3,018. In this enumeration, however, no account is taken of the large number of persons who are engaged in the Parish during the day, and reside away from their places of business. Local Government.—The Parish has a separate jurisdiction under the Metropolis Local Management Act, and particulars of the powers of the Vestry elected pursuant to that Act are given on page 25. For Poor Law purposes the Parish is joined to the Parish of St. Anne, under the name of the Westminster Union; it is also a constituent part of the Central London Sick Asylum District. For Ecclesiastical Purposes the Parish has been subdivided into five districts, the mother church being St. James's, Piccadilly, of which the Rev. J.E. Kempe, M.A.,is Rector. Representation in Parliament.—The Parish of St James was formerly comprised in the Parliamentary Borough of the City of Westminster, which returned two members to Parliament; it now, however, forms a part of the Borough of Strand, which returns one member, the present representative 15 being the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith. The Register prepared in 1888 contains the names of 4,145 Parliamentary electors, viz., 4 on the Scot and Lot List, 410 Lodgers; and 3,731 possessing other qualifications. There are also 272 County Electors who have been placed on the Register under the Local Government Act, 1888, but are not qualified to vote for members of Parliament. Parliamentary voters for the County of Middlesex in respect of property situate wholly or in part in the Parish of St. James, number 185. By the Elementary Education Act, 1870, the Parish is included in the Westminster Division of the School Board for London. Five members of the School Board are elected by the ratepayers of the Division. Water Supply.—Four Companies supply the Parish with water, the approximate boundaries of their respective districts being; as follows:— 1. Chelsea Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 35, Com_ mercial Road, Pimlico). So much of the Parish as lies to the south of the centre of Pall Mall and Cleveland Row. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1722. 2. New River Company (Chief Office, Clerkenwell, E.C.). So much of the Parish as lies to the east of a line running at the back of the east side of Poland Street, Lexington Street, Great Windmill Street, and along the centre of the Haymarket. This Company was incorporated by Royal Charter in the year 1619. 16 3. Grand Junction Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 65, South Molton Street). So much of the Parish as lies to the west of the district supplied by the New River Company and the north of the centre of Pall Mall. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1811. 4. West Middlesex Waterworks Company (Chief Office, 19, Marylebone Road). So much of Oxford Street as issituate within the Parish. This Company was incorporated by Act of Parliament in the year 1806. The charges authorised by the various Acts of Parliament relating to the several above-mentioned Companies are almost identical, the scale being as follows:— Where the annual value of the dwelling-house or other place does not exceed £200, a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. per annum; where such annual value exceeds £200, a rate not exceeding 3 per cent. per annum. An additional charge, varying from 4s. per annum where the annual value of the house exceeds £30 but is less than £-50, to 12s. where the annual value of the house exceeds £300, is permitted for each single water-closet, fixed bath, or high service; for each additional water-closet, fixed bath, or high service, half these rates are to be charged. High service is defined as a delivery of water at an elevation of more than ten feet above the pavement in front of the dwelling-house or other place supplied. The Companies may supply water for other than domestic purposes, either upon agreed terms or by meter at a specified rate. Gas is supplied to the whole Parish by the Gas Light and Coke Company (Chief Office, Horseferry Road). 17 The Coroner is Mr. Charles St. Clare Bedford, whose jurisdiction extends throughout the City and Liberties of Westminster. For the Registration of Births and Deaths the Parish is included in the Westminster District. The Sub-Registrar is Mr. Thomas Matthews Crowe, of 31, Wardour Street; and the Superintendent Registrar, Mr. Joseph Bond, Union Offices, Poland Street. WARDS. The Parish has been divided into four Wards, under the provisions of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, the boundaries thereof being officially described as follows:— Ward No. 1 (Great Marlborough)— All such parts of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, as lie upon the left-hand side, that is to say, upon the side lying towards the north and north-east of the following boundary line, that is to say, a line commencing upon the western boundary of the said Parish in Swallow Passage, and drawn in an easterly direction immediately at the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the south-west portion of the Regent (Oxford Street) Circus, thence across Regent Street, to and along the southern party-wall of No. 268, Regent Circus, and thence along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the south side of Oxford Street, across Argyll Street to the back of the tenements or premises forming the east side of Argyll Street, then turning south along the backs of the said several tenements or premises forming the east side of Argyll Street, and of the several tenements or premises in Great Marlborough Street forming the east side of the block of buildings between Argyll Place and Little Marlborough Street, then turning east across Carnaby Street, to and along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the north side of Tyler's Court and Little Marshall Street, thence c 18 turning south along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the east side of Marshall Street, to and turning east along the backs of the several premises forming the south side of Broad Street, to and drawn south along the backs of the several tenements or premises forming the west side of Cambridge Street, of Little Windmill Street, and of Great Windmill Street, passing at the backs of the several tenements and premises forming Angel Court, Bull Yard, and Ham Yard respectively, and thence to the Parish boundary at the angle thereof at the intersection of Coventry Street and the Haymarket.

Ward No. 4 (Golden Square)— All parts of the said Parish of Saint James, Westminster, not included in the Wards hereinbefore particularly described. PUBLIC BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The Receipts of the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses for the year 1888 again show a small increase, although the number of persons using the establishment was slightly less than in the preceding year. The following extracts from the Annual Report of the Commissioners, which was presented to the Vestry in January, are given as being of general interest to the parishioners:— As anticipated by the Commissioners in their last Annual Report, the figures for 1888 show but a slight variation from those for the previous year. An improvement on 1886, however, has again been manifested. The wet and cold summer prejudicially affected the attendance of the bathers, especially in the Swimming Bath. The reduction in the number of bathers in the summer, however, was partially made good by a larger attendance than usual towards the close of the year, owing to a continuance of exceptionally mild weather. The Laundry has been fairly well frequented throughout the year, and, although the average number of hours of each washer slightly exceeds the average for the previous year, the Commissioners believe 21 that the Laundry is used to a larger extent than ever by the class for whom such establishments were primarily intended, that is, those of the working population who do not possess conveniences for washing in their own homes. With a view to inculcate and encourage habits of personal cleanliness, the Commissioners have resolved to admit children attending the Pulteney Board School, at reduced rates, to the Baths. They are prepared to favourably consider applications for a reduction in the price of admission from the Managers of other Schools and Institutions, it being understood that bathers admitted at reduced rates are limited to days when the establishment is not used to the fullest extent by the general public. The Commissioners are persuaded that both the Baths and Wash-houses have proved a potent factor in the amelioration of the social condition of the labouring poor of the neighbourhood, and they invite those who are specially brought into contact with the poorer classes to encourage the use of the establishment by such as have no proper conveniences at home. It may be mentioned that a private warm bath, supplied with clean water for each bather, and the use of a clean towel, can be had for 2d., and that the inclusive price of a washing trough, supplied with steam, hot and cold water, wringing machine, drying horse heated by steam, irons and mangle, is 2d. per hour. The mere economy resulting from the use of the Laundry on such terms must be considerable, while the comfort arising from the abolition of "washing day" in a home of one or two rooms cannot be stated in money value. A comparison of the figures given in the following summary of the lleceipts and Expenditure for the past three years will show the present satisfactory financial condition of the Establishment. The loan which was borrowed for the erection of the building will be entirely liquidated two years hence, consequently, contingencies apart, it may reasonably be anticipated that the Baths will not require any further aid from the rates:— 22 Receipts from Bathers and 1886. 1887.

The three Commissioners who retired in January by effluxion of time (Mr. Malin, Mr. Styles, and Mr. Tapping) were re-elected for the usual period. The thanks of the Vestry were voted to Mr. Burgess, on his resignation, for the services which he rendered to the Parish during the period he held the office of Commissioner, part of which time he was Chairman. A list of the Commissioners is given on page 12, and a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year 1888 and the number of bathers and washers, on pages 122-3. ARCHBISHOP TENISON'S SCHOOL. Three of the Trustees of Archbishop Tenison's United Schools for the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. James are elected by the Vestry. A vacancy occurred during the year by the expiration of the term for which Mr. Frederick Crane had been elected, and was filled up by the unanimous re-appointment of that gentleman. 23 A statement of the Accounts of the Schools for the year 1888 is given on page 126. BURLINGTON SCHOOL. This School is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in the year 1875, and two of the Governors are elected by the Vestry. The present representative Governors are Mr. William Cox and Mr. F. H. Bingham. A statement of the Accounts of the School for the year 1888 is given on page 127. THE CRAVEN PEST-HOUSE CHARITY. Five Parishes participate in the benefits of this Charity, viz., St. Martin in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover-square, St. Clement Danes, St. Paul, Covent Garden, and St. James. Four of the Trustees are appointed on the nomination of the Vestry, the present representatives of the Parish being Mr. F. Crane, Mr. J. Bonthron, Mr. R. W. Burgess, and Mr. W. Winnett. The income of the Charity is applied, under an order of the Court of Chancery, to the maintenance of beds in King's College Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital, for the reception of poor patients from the five parishes mentioned. The hospitals are also required to afford out-treatment to all poor persons resident in any of the five parishes, who may be sent by the Trustees. A copy of the Accounts of the Charity for the year 1888 is given on page 128. 24 MRS. ANN NEWTON'S CHARITY. This Charity, for the apprenticing of one poor boy of St. James's annually from the Union School, is administered by the Board of Governors and Directors of the Poor. A copy of the Accounts for the year 1888 is given on page 131. LE QUAINTER'S CHARITY. The only Charity which is administered by the Vestry is that known as Le Quainter's. It arises from a bequest, in 1782, by Mr. Peter Le Quainter, formerly a resident in Piccadilly, who directed that the income should be "equally distributed at Christmas amongst twenty poor persons who are or have been housekeepers in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, and such as the Rector and Churchwardens, and the other gentlemen for the time being who shall compose the Vestry of the said Parish, shall deem to be proper objects, and the most deserving to partake of the same." The property of the Charity consists of £9,969 2s. 9d. New Three per Cent. Annuities. Under the scheme for converting the funded National Debt, the income of this Charity will be reduced by nearly £25 per annum. A statement of the Accounts for the past year is given on page 130. ST. MARTIN'S ALMSHOUSE AND PENSIONS CHARITY. This Charity is administered under a scheme established by the Charity Commissioners in 1886, the governing body comprising ex-officio, co-optative, and representative Trustees. 25 Two of the latter are elected by the Vestry of this Parish the present representatives being Mr. Morle and Mr. Winnett. A copy of the Accounts of this Charity for the year 1888, will be found on pages 134-5. OTHER PAROCHIAL CHARITIES. A list of other endowed Charities in which the Parish is interested is given on pages 138 to 145, and statements of the accounts on pages 129 to 133. THE VESTRY, As constituted by the Metropolis Local Management Act 1855, consists of 48 elected and three ex-officio Members. It superseded an elected Vestry acting under the provisions of the statute 1 & 2 William IV., cap. 60, which was adopted by the ratepayers of St. James's on the 6th April, 1832. All the powers of the former Vestry and of the Paving Commissioners acting under Local Acts, as well as some of the functions of the Commissioners of Sewers, were transferred to the re-constituted Vestry. An Act was passed in the year 1858 relative to the main drainage of the Metropolis, by which the Vestry, as the rating authority of the Parish, were required to meet precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, for a Main Drainage Rate not to exceed 3d. in the pound per annum. In 1862 the powers of the Vestry were enlarged by the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Act, and in the 26 following year turnpike roads in the Metropolis were transferred from Commissioners, who had power to levy tolls upon horses and other animals and vehicles, to the Local Authorities, whose expenses are defrayed from the rates. The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Act, 1869, and Money Acts of the Board, subsequently passed, besides making some alterations in the mode of assessing the expenses of the Board, have afforded increased facilities for the raising of money by Vestries and District Boards, of which the Vestry of St. James have availed themselves to a small extent. By the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879, the Vestry are empowered to purchase samples of food and drugs for analysis, to appoint a Public Analyst, and to prosecute vendors of adulterated articles. Proceedings under these Acts during the past year are mentioned on pages 65-6. The Vestry have also various powers under the Metropolitan Paving Act, 57 George III., cap. 29, commonly known as Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, the Nuisances Removal Acts, the Metropolitan Building Acts,- the Metropolis Gas Act, the Sanitary Act, 1866, the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, better known as Torrens' Act, and other statutes. There has been a growing tendency for some years to include in the local rates various sums for Metropolitan purposes, over the expenditure of which local authorities do not possess the slightest control. Thus, since the establishment of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855, the Vestry have at different times been required by Parliament to provide funds for—(a) Main Drainage ; (b) Fire 27 Brigade; (c) Elementary Education; (d) Thames Bridges —purchase, maintenance, and rebuilding; (e) Artizans' Dwellings, and other purposes. A statement of moneys raised with the parochial rates for Metropolitan purposes is given on page 39. STANDING ORDERS. Operative Resolutions in the nature of Standing Orders have been passed during the year as follows : - 12th April, 1888.—That the Surveyor be instructed to give notice from time to time to every person to whom a licence for a hoarding has been granted, of the expiration of such licence, and that no licence be renewed until the Surveyor has satisfied himself that such renewal is necessary for the protection or safety of the public.

(W. 11, p. 89.) 20th December, 1888.—That the heads of Departments be requested to take steps to see that their subordinates keep their proper time. (V. 17, p. 75.) 20th December, 1888.—That the following suggestions for improving the present system of keeping the Vestry's Accounts, submitted by the Finance and House Committee, be approved and adopted (V. 17, p. 74.):— That a priced invoice be required to be furnished by the tradesmen with each delivery of goods, or on completion of each order for work, such invoice to be certified and handed over to the Accounts Clerk for entry in the Ledger, after comparison with the counterpart order. That different classes of work form the subject of separate Accounts. That all Order Books be sent to the Vestry Clerk's Office for examination on Tuesday in each week. 29 That vouchers for day work be sent to the Vestry Clerk's Office after they have been entered in the proper books, for comparison with the orders given, and if correct, for entry in the ledger. That accounts for paving works done for builders and others be sent by the Surveyor to the Vestry Clerk's Office, on Tuesday in each week. That the letters applying for payment of rates prior to the issuing of summonses be sent out from the Office, instead of by the Eate Collectors. That the Rate Collectors be required in future to prepare their copy rate book so far as the names are concerned, the rateable value and sums to be collected to be inserted in the Office, as at present. That the Rate Collectors be required to furnish, within 14 days after Midsummer and Christmas Day respectively, a schedule of premises which were unoccupied during the whole or a portion of the preceding half-year. That the Rate Collectors be required to make up their returns fortnightly to the Tuesday evening before the meeting of the Finance Committee, and send their books to the Vestry Clerk's Office for examination on the Wednesday morning. 28th February, 1889.—That a statement of the sums paid under each head of work tendered for be prepared annually for the information of the Works Committee, when tenders for works and materials are under consideration. (V. 17, p. 124.) THE ELECTION OF VESTRYMEN AND AUDITORS OF ACCOUNTS Was held on Monday, the 28th day of May; the places appointed for the purpose being-Pall Mall Ward, Willis's Rooms, King Street; Church Ward, Vestry Hall, Piccadilly; Golden Square Ward, National School House, Marshall Street; and Great Marlborough Ward, Board Room, Poland Street. 30 A Poll took place in Pall Mall and Golden Square Wards,, and the total expense of conducting the elections, including the hire of rooms and publication of notices, amounted to £21 13s. 4d. An order for the payment of this sum from the Poor Rate was made by the Yestry in accordance with the Statute. The Vestry feel that at least a passing reference is due to the resignation, in consequence of removal from the Parish,. A of Mr. Joseph Box, who had been annually elected by the Parishioners one of the Auditors of Accounts for 15 years in succession. On the 20th December the vestry passed a resolution expressing their appreciation of the services thus rendered to the Parishioners by Mr. Box, whose father, it is interesting to note, was at one time Churchwarden, and for many years a much esteemed member of the vestry. A list of the Vestrymen and Auditors of Accounts will be found on pages 7 and 8. YESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The following is the number of meetings held during the year:— Vestry Meetings 31 Finance and House Committee 24 Sanitary, Parliamentary Bills, and General Purposes Committee 17 Works and Improvements Committee 32 Sanitary and Works Committees (Joint) 4 Lighting Committee 13 St. James's Dwellings Committee 13 Special and Sub-Committees 2 Committee of whole vestry 2 Total 138 31 The Vestry usually meet on alternate Thursday mornings,, but a special meeting may be convened at any time upon the requisition of five members, and some of the ordinary meetings are suspended at vacation times. Four Standing Committees are appointed annually, in accordance with the byelaws of the Vestry, and meet as frequently as occasion may require. Special Committees are appointed from time to time to consider subjects not coming within the ordinary duties of either of the Standing Committees. OFFICIAL VOTING PAPERS AT VESTRY ELECTIONS. It has long been the custom in this Parish to provide official _ ballot papers for the use of voters at a contested election of Vestrymen, although the Churchwardens have no power to refuse to receive other papers, whether of a party character or in manuscript. The use of official papers is almost the invariable practice of the electors in St. James's, so that any necessity for an alteration in the law has not been keenly felt, but on the Kensington Vestry intimating that they had brought the subject under the notice of the Local Government Board and the Metropolitan Board of Works, Avith a view to early legislation, rendering the use of official papers obligatory, the Vestry, agreeing in the principle, expressed concurrence, and addressed communications to the two Boards mentioned to a like effect. The Local Government Board have promised to consider the suggestion, but the Metropolitan Board of Works have definitively replied that they will not be able to promote the desired legislation. 32 CHURCHWARDENS. The Vestry appointed Churchwardens on the 5th day of April, when Mr. Frederick Crane was again chosen as Senior Churchwarden, and Mr. Samuel Morle was appointed Junior 'Churchwarden, to succeed Mr. William Cox, who had held that office continuously since the year 1882. SIDESMEN Were elected by the Vestry on the 5th day of April, the under-mentioned gentlemen being selected to fill the office :— Mr. James Thomas Robertson, 7, St. James's Street. Mr. James McMillan, 104, Jermyn Street. Mr. Benjamin F. Hawkins, 108, Jermyn Street. Mr. James Malin, 16 & 17, King Street. OVERSEERS OF THE POOR. Eight parishioners were nominated by the Vestry on the 5th day of April, to serve as Overseers of the Poor. The gentlemen chosen from this list, and appointed by . the Justices of the Peace, at a Petty Sessions held on the 13th April, to act as Overseers for the year 1888-9, were: — Mr. Charles Hillier, 9, Cleveland Row. Mr. John Malin, 117, Jermvn Street. Mr. George Biggs, 14 & 15, Warwick Street. Mr. James Tapping, 45, Berwick Street. GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS OF THE POOR. In accordance with the requirements of the Local Act .2 Geo. III., cap. 58, the Vestry met on the 5th April, for the purpose of appointing twenty-one "substantial and A A OO » discreet" persons, either from their own body, or from among the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex or Westminster, or other " creditable inhabitants" of the Parish, such persons, together with the Churchwardens or Overseers of the Poor, to be called Governors and Directors of the Poor. A list of the gentlemen so appointed is given on page 11, and a statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Board on page 124. When this Board was created by Parliament in the year 1762, its principal duties were administering poor-law relief and street cleansing. The Board neither made nor collected the Poor Rate, but it was upon their order that payments from the rate were made. The Board acted as the Poor-law .a uthority in the Parish until the formation of the Westminster Union in the year 1868, and as the duty of street cleansing had already passed to the Yestry, the transfer of Poor-law duties to the Guardians of the Union left the Governors and Directors of the Poor with scarcely any function to perform except to order payments from the Poor Rate. It appearing both to the Board and to the Vestry that the Board had outlived its period of usefulness, and that the administration of parochial business would be simplified by the transfer of their remaining duties to the Vestry, application was made by the Board, with the concurrence of the Vestry, to the Local Government Board for an Order under the Acts 30 & 31 Vic., cap. 106 ; 31 & 32 Vic., cap. 122; and 42 & 43 Vie., cap. 54, to repeal so much of the local legislation relating to this Parish as requires the Vestry to appoint Governors and Directors of the Poor, and to transfer the duties, powers and property of the Governors and Directors to the Vestry. The Local Government Board, in acknowledging the receipt d 34 of this application, intimated that, before they arrived at any decision on the subject, a local enquiry would be held by one of their Inspectors. The enquiry was held at the Vestry Hall, by E. P. Burd,, Esq., on the 12th March, when evidence was given in support of the application. The Guardians of the Westminster Union suggested that the administration of Mrs. Newton's Charity (see page 24) should be transferred to them, and that the fee of the houses in Marshall Street belonging to the Parish (see page 45) should be vested in the Guardians of the Union. The Local Government Board had not intimated their decision on the application of the Governors and Directors of the Poor at the close of the parochial year in March. PREACHER AND ASSISTANT TO THE RECTOR. The Vestry confirmed, on the 5th April, the nomination by the Rector of the Rev. Henry Kirk, M.A., Queen's College, Oxford, as Preacher and Assistant, in succession to the Rev. G. A. Starkey, M.A., who resigned on preferment. Mr. Kirk subsequently resigned on receiving the appointment of Secretary to the Bishop of London's Fund, and on the 17th January the Vestry confirmed the Rector's nomination of the Rev. Herbert Bury, M.A., Lincoln College, Oxford, to fill the vacancy. A salary of £100 a year is payable from the Poor Rate to. the Preacher and Assistant, under the provisions of a local Act of Parliament. The Vestry have had under consideration the desirability of promoting legislation to abolish this payment, as contrary 35 to the spirit of the age, and the Rector has expressed his assent, in principle, to the proposal, on condition that the Parish Church is emancipated from the ill-defined control which the Vestry may, if it is so minded, exercise over its internal management. Understanding, however, that circumstances may arise in the near future rendering it desirable to apply to Parliament for extended powers in relation to the Endowment of the Church, the Vestry have deferred taking any decisive step for the present. CLERK IN ORDERS. The Rev. William Edward Windle, M.A., Worcester College, Oxford, who was appointed Clerk in Orders in 1888, resigned 011 preferment towards the close of the year. The Rector had not nominated any clergyman to fill this vacancy at Lady-day. No payment is made to the Clerk in Orders out of the rates, but he is entitled, under the provisions of a local Act of Parliament, to the yearly sum of £30 out of the profits of the pews in the Church. OFFICERS OF THE VESTRY. ■ Several alterations have occurred in the Staff of the Vestry during the past year. Vestry Clerk's Department.—Mr. R. H. Beacall, who had held the appointment of Accountant for upwards of thirty-two years, resigned on account of increasing age, and was awarded a superannuation allowance of £99 a year. To fill the vacancy thus caused, Mr. J. M. Crow, second Assistant Clerk, was appointed " Accounts, Rates, and General Clerk," d 2 36 with an increase of £20 per annum in his salary, and Mr. F. Lampard was appointed third assistant, at a salary of £70 per annum. Sanitary Department.—The engagement of Mr. Edwin Brooks, one of the Inspectors of Nuisances, was terminated in the month of April, and advantage was taken of the opportunity to reorganize the department. Mr. W. H. Watson was put in charge of the whole Parish as Chief Inspector, at a salary since increased to £140 per annum, and Mr. A. F. Lawrence was appointed Assistant Inspector, at a salary of £80. Rate Collectors.—In the month of April, Mr. J. J. Johnson, of Upper John Street, was appointed Collector of Rates in Great Marlborough Ward in place of Mr. F. Green, and in the month of October a second change in the staff of Collectors was necessitated by the resignation of Mr. James Scott, owing to increasing age and infirmities, after a faithful service extending over nearly 38 years. Mr. R. E. Burgess was subsequently appointed Collector of Rates in Church Ward to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr. Scott. A list of the Officers of the Vestry and their respective salaries is given on pages 112-113. FINANCIAL. It will be seen on reference to the accounts commencing on page 106, that the year commenced with a balance in the Treasurer's hands amounting to £10,944 19s. l0d. The sum of £82,717 3s. 6d. was received during the twelve months, and the expenditure for the same period reached a total of £85,525 15s. l1d., leaving a balance of £8,136 7s. 5d. on the 25th March,1889. 37 37 Against this cash balance, however, there were, on the last mentioned date, debts and liabilities properly chargeable to income amounting to £10,82 0s. 6d. with assets (exclusive of cash balance) estimated to realise £806 13s. 2d. leaving a deficit of £1,876 19s. 11d. to be provided for in the present year. LOANS. A statement of the loans now outstanding is given on page 115. RATEABLE VALUE. The Assessment of the Parish, according to the valuation list which came into force on the 6th of April, 1886, was as follows:— Gross value £831,835 Rateable value £694,201 Since the preparation of that list several properties have been taken down, and a few houses which have been re-built or altered have come into rating. The alterations in assessment thus made increase the totals of the Valuation List to the following amounts:— Gross value £841,785 Rateable value £702,605 RATES were made by the Vestry during the year as follows :— Amount in the Pound, s. d. Poor Rate (including, in addition to charges for the Relief of the Poor, Police, County, and Lunatic Rates, contributions to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and other general charges) ... 1 5 38 Brought forward 1 5 General Rate for the lighting, maintenance, repairing and cleansing of streets, watering carriageways, administration expenses, precepts of the School Board of London, and proportion of the Bridge Expenses of the Metropolitan Board of Works 1 6 Sewers Rate, for the maintenance, repairing, and cleansing of sewers vested in the Vestry 2 Metropolitan Consolidated Rate, for meeting the precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works, so far as relates to the Fire Brigade, Main Drainage, Metropolitan Improvements, and general expenses of the Board 8 Total 3 9 The rates for each of the two previous years were 3s. l0d. and 3s. l1d. in the pound respectively. The following statement shows the amount of the rates and the collection thereof:— Poor Rate— £ s. d. Amount of rate as levied 48,920 2 5 Arrears of former rates 818 5 4 1/4 Rates on property assessed during the year 489 7 8½ £50,227 15 5¾ Collected 48,521 12 21/4 Loss from empty houses, &c. 1,254 7 0 Arrears at close of year 451 16 3½ £50,227 15 5¾ Other Parochial Rates.— Amount of rates as levied 80,574 6 4 Arrears of former rates 1,104 17 4¾ Rates on property assessed for the year 803 15 6 £82,482 19 2¾ Collected 79,796 13 6½ Loss from empty houses, &c. 2,001 0 8 Arrears at close of year 685 5 0 1/4 £82,482 19 2| 39 Under the provisions of the Local Acts of Parliament relating to the Parish of St. James, the rates are made annually, but are recoverable by four quarterly instalments. For the convenience of Parishioners, however, it has become the practice to collect the rates in two half-yearly sums. In view of the increasing demands by central Authorities over whose expenditure the Vestry does not possess any control, although for economy in collection the funds are raised with the local rates, the following statement will be of interest to ratepayers :— Total amount expended, £143,781 10s. 8d.

Metropolitan Asylums District 9,920 11 11 5,650 2 7 5,035 0 0 Central London Sick Asylum 2,560 0 0 2,785 13 4 2,684 0 0 Metropolitan Common Poor Fund 9,858 5 5 1 3,279 1 7 8,901 12 11 Police 14,332 5 4 1 4,607 1 10 14,501 5 4 County and Lunatic Asylums Bates 3,583 1 3 3,615 12 7 3,625 6 3 Expenses of School Board 24,745 12 11 2 5,573 6 4 24,241 9 6 Expenses of Metropolitan Board of Works 21,052 7 5 2 0,155 8 2 22,036 1 3 £ 86,052 4 3 £8 5,666 6 5 ; £81,024 15 3 The payments to Central Authorities last year amounted to £5,632 15s. 9d. more than for the previous year, and to £605 6s. 9d. more than for the year 1885-6. It will be seen that of the total sum raised under the name of local rates, a very small proportion is applicable to strictly local expenditure, no less than £86,657 l1s. Od. of the total of £143,781 10s. 8d. having been paid over during the year to various authorities over whose expenditure the vestry and other Parochial Boards have no control. In other words, out of every shilling raised as local rates in St. James's, less than fivepence is spent by the Parochial Authorities. The following statement illustrates the enormous increase in the demands of the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London during the last ten years:— I879-80 1880-1 1881-2 l082-8 1883-4 1684-5 i886-6 1806-7 1887-8 18 Metropoltan Board of Works 14,008 15,357 16-546 17,614 17,583 18,361 21,052 20,155 22,036 24,40 School Board for London 13,115 15,064 15,941 16,466 19,075 22,328 24,501 25,573 24,241 23,42 Total 27.123 30.421 32.487 34 080 36,658 40.689 45,553 45.728 46,277 47,831 41 The relative increase in these demands was greater than the actual figures would denote, the rateable value of the Parish (the basis of contribution) having increased from £575,756 in 1879-80 to £702,245 in 1888-9. The total amount raised with the local rates for these two Boards alone, during the ten years, is £386,852, being an average of £38,685 per annum. These precepts, which, in the year 1879-80 represented a rate of less than Is. in the pound, had increased to a rate of about Is. 4d. in the pound in 1888-9. TAXATION OF GROUND RENTS. A resolution was passed on the 5th July, concurring in the views of the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, that the owners of the land should be rated upon the ground rents and improved values of land towards the cost of carrying out Metropolitan improvements. The vestry have, however, not committed themselves to any scheme for giving effect to this principle, and they feel that considerable difficulty will be experienced in dealing equitably with ground rents, rent charges, and premiums, the latter being, in many cases, capitalised ground rents. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that the rack rent is fixed at such an amount as will cover all outgoings, including ground rent, and that the general tendency of taxation is to fall eventually upon the consumer. UNIFORM POOR RATE. A communication having been received from the Yestry of Lambeth, urging the establishment of a uniform Poor Rate 42 for the Metropolis, the Vestry passed a resolution on the 10th May, agreeing in principle with the proposal, subject to adequate safeguards against a natural tendency to extravagance on the part of authorities who would derive benefit from uniformity. Having regard, however, to the many important subjects then engaging public attention, and to the fact that the Local Government Bill, which was at that time before Parliament and has since become law, would largely equalise the Poor Rate in the Metropolis, the Yestry did not deem it opportune to press the subject on the Government or the Legislature. THE RATING OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. In the month of December, a letter was received from the Guardians of St. Olave's Union, calling attention to the present system of rating public companies owning docks, railways, and property of similar description, upon their profits instead of the annual value of their property. Lpon the subject being considered, it appeared to the Yestry that while the authorities of parishes in which docks, railways, and other undertakings are being carried on at unremunerative or with diminished earnings, are sufferers, under existing circumstances, yet these authorities would largely benefit by the operation of the present system of assessment on the recurrence of more prosperous times. The matter is also vastly complicated by the network of railways extending throughout the kingdom, because at present each parish receives a contribution from a railway passing through its area, even although it may contain neither station nor 43 depot, and this contribution is based not upon the actual value of the property in the district belonging to the railway company, but upon its assumed mileage earning-power as part of the system. It is evident, therefore, that any rearrangement such as above proposed could not be confined to the Metropolis, and it is difficult to see how any better system for rating undertakings of the kind referred to could be adopted as a general principle. The Yestry communicated these views to the St. Olave's Board, and expressed their willingness to join in a Conference of Rating Authorities to consider so difficult a question, although they could not advise a departure from the general principles of rating which govern the whole country, to meet what, it is hoped, is but a passing depression, affecting a limited area. INHABITED HOUSE DUTY. Upon the invitation of the Southport Company House Proprietors Association, the Yestry appointed three of their members to join a deputation, from various provincial towns, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to urge that lodging houses, carried on as a means of living, should be classed as business premises, and assessed at the lower rate of Duty. The deputation waited upon Mr. Goschen on the 14th December, but did not receive any very definite assurance of relief. The objections which the Yestry entertain to the Inhabited House Duty, as at present levied, are set forth at some length in their Report for the year 1887-8. 44 VESTRY PROPERTY. vestry Hall.— Advantage was taken of the summer vacation to adapt the room formerly used by the Savings Bank to the Surveyor's Office, and to thoroughly cleanse the building. Tenders were invited for the work, and that of Messrs. Hatfield & Son for the sum of £60 was accepted. A pair of curtains have been hung by the door in the Vestry Hall to prevent draught. Stables and Stoneyard.—Some additional sheds have been constructed for the better protection of the road scrapers, &c., at a cost of £54 2s. 0d. Disinfector.—The Disinfector has been used for disinfecting bedding, clothing, &c., for parishioners on 42 occasions, compared with 81 in 1887-8, and 25 in 1886-7. Mortuary.—The bodies of 30 persons have been received into the Mortuary during the year, as compared with 34 during the previous twelve months. Medical men, the clergy, district visitors, and others who are specially brought into contact with the poor, are invited to assist the Vestry in preventing the spread of disease which may arise from the retention of a corpse in a room occupied perhaps by a number of people in a thickly-populated neighbourhood, by making known, as occasion requires, the provision made for the reception of bodies in a decent manner, and with all possible deference to the natural feelings of the bereaved relatives. As the main object of providing a Mortuary and Disinfectant Apparatus is to protect the parishioners at large against 45 the spread of infectious disease, either may be used without charge. Information as to the mode of proceeding in such a case may be freely obtained at the Yestry Hall. OTHER PARISH PROPERTY. Eleven freehold houses on the east side of Marshall Street were purchased in the year 1819, for Parochial purposes. Two of the houses are now absorbed into the Workhouse premises, and the site of three others has been utilized for the erection of the Public Baths and Wash-houses. The remaining six houses are let; four of them on repairing agreements, and two on monthly tenancies in anticipation of their being shortly required for purposes of repair. The rent received for these six houses, together with the sum receivable from the Westminster Union in respect of that portion of the Workhouse premises belonging to the Parish of St. James, is applied in aid of the Poor Rate. PARISH CHURCH CLOCK. The Parish Church Clock needing somewhat extensive repair, the Rector and Churchwardens requested the Vestry to undertake the same at the cost of the Rates. The Vestry, however, did not deem it prudent to adopt this course, but on a subscription being subsequently raised, they contributed £20 to the fund, considering the maintenance of the clock in a proper state of repair to be an object of public benefit. SCAVENGING, DUST REMOVAL, &c. Upon the receipt of a Report from one of the Inspectors of the Board of Trade as to the injury caused to the fisheries in 46 the Estuary of the Thames by the deposit of refuse alleged to be removed from London dustbins, the vestry resolved to prohibit such deposit in any future contract for the removal of dust, so far as this parish is concerned, by the introduction of a penal clause into the contract. The Vestry have also decided to adopt carts fitted with metal telescopic covers, for dust removal. In view of the expiration of the contracts for scavenging and dust removal at Lady-day, tenders were invited by public advertisement in the month of January, Seventeen tenders were received, and that of Messrs. Mead & Co., of Paddington, for the sum of £4,500 per annum for the whole work, was accepted. The term of the contract is three years, power being reserved to the Yestry to terminate it at the end of the first or second year. The Yestry have repeatedly, as opportunity offered, advocated the adoption of what is commonly known as the "pail system" in the removal of dust. The advantages and working of this system as proposed in this Parish, were explained in a circular which was distributed in February and March, of which the following is a copy:— The Vestry earnestly invite the aid of the Ratepayers and Householders individually in the important matter of dust storage and removal. Dust-bins built in the usual way are objectionable on many grounds; not infrequently they are so constructed or placed that they cannot be completely cleared each time the dustman calls, as they should be, and thus decaying refuse may be left at the bottom of the bin, to rot and possibly disseminate disease. The act of digging out the refuse is also necessarily a dirty operation, and occupies the time o£ the dustman needlessly. 47 Portable Receptacles for refuse are not open to these objections. If properly covered they may be placed in any corner which cannot be utilized for other purposes, the dustman simply has to carry the receptacle to his cart, empty the contents, and replace the receptacle in the place he took it from. No dirt in the house need be caused, and dust may probably be removed from three houses by this means in the time occupied in clearing out one dust-bin of the old-fashioned type. Dust may thus be removed at any hour of the day without causing dirt or inconvenience. The dustman need not enter the house if the servant brings the receptacle up to him when he calls. Dust Receptacles must not be placed in the street. Suitable metal receptacles for dust, with proper covers, may be purchased of almost any ironmonger for a few shillings, and they will last for years. In the interests of cleanliness and the public health, as well as on economical grounds, the vestry strongly urge Householders to abolish brick-built dust-bins, which frequently occupy space that might be utilized to better advantage, and to store such of their refuse as cannot be burned in portable covered metal receptacles. In large establishments several receptacles of a convenient size for handling are better than large receptacles. Small receptacles are, moreover, less likely to be damaged in emptying or removal. Under the system adopted by the vestry, the road- sweepers are employed and paid by the vestry, but the collection and removal of house dust, street refuse, &c., are done under contract. The total cost of scavenging and dust removal for the past year, as given in the Accounts, was £6,292 6s. 7d., compared with £6,269 8s. 6d. for the previous vear. The following is a statement of the number of loads reported to have been removed from the parish during the year ;— Cart Loads. Wagon Loads. Dust 3,537 3,224. Slop 526 4,639. 48 The cost of Street Watering last year was £784 8s. l1d., or £216 6s. 3d. less than in 1887-8. REMOVAL OF SNOW. In anticipation of a possible heavy snowfall, the Vestry early in the winter sought and obtained a renewal of the conditional consent of the Thames Conservators and the Metropolitan Board of Works, to the casting of clean snow over the parapet of the Victoria Embankment into the river. The heavy fall of snow which occurred on the 10th February necessitated the use of this permission to a considerable extent. The following statement prepared by the Vestry's Surveyor will give some idea of the labour involved in clearing the streets after a fairly heavy fall of snow, and the cost thereof. It is gratifying to note that the arrangements were tolerably complete, and gave satisfaction generally to the parishioners :— MEN. Regular Men. Odd Men. Boys. £ s. d.

Particulars of the various contracts entered into or continued during the year are given on page 118. STREET LIGHTING. On the 25th March, 1888, there were 778 public lamps in the various thoroughfares of the Parish, 751 of which were ordinary street lamps (457 burning cannel gas, and 294 burning common gas), 4 were urinal lamps, and 23 were larger lamps attached to refuges. On the 25th March, 1889, the number of lamps was 807, showing an increase of 29 in the twelve months; the proportion of different lamps is now 452 cannel gas street lamps, 321 common gas street lamps, 4 urinal lamps, and 30 refuge e 50 lamps. The ordinary street lamps are lighted, extinguished, cleaned, and maintained by the Gas Company under an arrangement with the Vestry; the agreed sum for the greater part of last year was £3 per annum for each lamp burning cannel gas, and £3 0s. 8d. for each lamp burning common gas. The light given is practically identical, 4ft. of cannel gas being supplied per lamp per hour, and 5ft. of common gas. Larger street lamps are charged for at a proportionate price, but as regards the refuge lamps, payment is made according to the consumption of gas as registered by meter. The total cost of street lighting for the past year amounted to £2,559 5s. 8d., as compared with £2,325 10s. 6d. for the previous twelve months. This sum is exclusive of new lamp-posts, lanterns and fittings, which cost a further sum of £359 8s. 0d. The additional cost of street lighting is fully explained by the increased consumption of gas in the street lamps throughout the Parish, to which reference was made in the Vestry's Report for 1887-8, and by a perceptible addition to the number of lamps. The cost of street lighting for the current year will show a still further increase, as most of the additional lamps erected last year only came into charge towards its close, and several other lamps were ordered by the Vestry to be erected, but had not been put in position during the period covered by this report. With a view to deriving the utmost possible advantage from the increased consumption of gas, the Vestry have entered into a contract for the supply of about 500 new lanterns, similar in design to those fixed in Regent Street, to take the place of the worn-out obsolete lanterns in various parts of the Parish. Tenders for the supply of these 51 lanterns were invited by public advertisement, and that of Messrs. Pontifex & Co., of Coleman Street, was accepted, the contract price being— Not less than 250, at per lantern. Not less than 500, at per lantern. 16in. lantern and frog, fitted, & complete c., 21/8 21/- 14in. ,, ,, ,, 19/6 19/- 16in. lantern fixed on bracket 17/9 17/6 14in. ,, „ „ 15/9 15/6 THE PRICE OF GAS. The price of common gas to ordinary consumers was reduced on the 1st of January to 2s. 6d. per 1,000 feet. This is higher than the price charged for public lighting, the difference arising from the Gas Light and Coke Company being required by law to charge, for public purposes, the same price as is charged to private consumers in the District of the South Metropolitan Gas Company, even although their profits may not be sufficient to warrant a general reduction in price. PRIVATE LAMPS. The Vestry some years since decided not to permit the erection of Private Lamps, except upon the following conditions :— 1. That no part of such Lamps shall be less than 10 feet in height from the public footway. 2. That no such Lamps shall in any case project further than the inside of the kerb bounding the footway. e 2 52 3. That all such Lamps shall be entirely free from writing or any trade devices, except in such cases as Medical Men, Post Offices, Sweeps, Fire Engines, or other positions where they would be a public guide in cases of emergency. 4. That no such Lamps shall be suspended by ball and socket-joint only. 5. That no Lamps on posts be agreed to unless they are kept lighted the whole night. 6. That a sketch of the proposed Lamps, with their dimensions and of any intended inscription thereon, be submitted with the application to the Vestry for approval. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. This subject has engaged the attention of the Vestry and' the Lighting Committee almost continuously throughout the year, owing to a revival of the hope that Electric Lighting will shortly become a commercial success, and the consequent applications from various Companies for powers to include this Parish in their proposed area of supply. As stated in the last Annual Report, there were two applications for authority to supply the electric light in the Parish under consideration at Lady-day; one by the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company for a Provisional Order, and the other by the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company for a Licence. With regard to the Provisional Order, several modifications in the draft were suggested by the Vestry, and formed the subject of repeated interviews with the Board of Trade. Many of these suggestions were of a technical character, and all of them aimed at giving adequate controlling power to the Yestry, subject to appeal in order to guard against a 53 capricious or arbitrary use of such power. There were, however, two amendments to which the Vestry attached much importance: a declaration that the granting of the Order conferred no monopoly, but that the Vestry should be free to assent to the introduction of a competing undertaking, and, secondly, a clause to prevent amalgamation between competing undertakings without the consent of the Vestry. Upon the first point, the Board of Trade had already declared that a competing undertaking might be introduced if the original undertakers did not fully carry out their obligations, but it appeared to the Vestry most desirable to retain the power of introducing competition, irrespective of any such condition, •even if it were not found necessary to use it. After carefully considering the views of the Vestry, the Board of Trade, by letter, dated the 19th May, stated that— "It is quite clear that the grant of a Provisional Order or Licence under the Electric Lighting Act confers no monopoly upon the undertakers ; and they (the Board) are of opinion that no clause of the nature of that suggested could be framed which would not have the effect of limiting the right of competition which exists without such a clause, and which the Board of Trade, equally with the Local Authorities, are anxious to preserve. "In these circumstances the Board of Trade are unable to agree to the insertion of any such clause. "They wish it, however, to be distinctly understood that the present Order, if granted and confirmed, will in no way restrict or impede the Local Authorities, should they desire under any circumstances either to apply themselves for a Provisional Order or Licence, or to support such an application if made by another body of undertakers, and that the Board of Trade reserve to themselves the full right of considering any such application, by whomsoever made and whatever may be the position of the present undertaking. 54 "I am to add, with regard to the second clause submitted by the Local Authorities [to prevent amalgamation] that the object appears by the Board of Trade to be one which should be effected by an agreement between the Local Authorities and the Promoters, a copy of the agreement being 'scheduled to the Order.'" The foregoing official statement, that in granting a Provisional Order the Board of Trade reserved to themselves full liberty to grant further Orders or Licences in the same area of supply, completely answered the purpose of the Yestry. With regard to the second proposed clause, the Vestry entered into an agreement with the promoters, and. submitted the same to be scheduled to the Order, as suggested by the Board of Trade. Some technical difficulty, however, arose, and as the Vestry entertained considerable objection to the existence of a private agreement outside the Order, they again urged upon the Board that the subject matter of the Agreement might properly be incorporated in a clause in the Order. After some little delay, the Board of Trade assented to this course, and a paragraph to the following effect was inserted :— The Undertakers shall not at any time, without the previous consent in writing of the Local Authority, acquire or purchase the undertaking of, or associate themselves with, any other Company or person supplying or intending to supply electricity within the Parish of St. James, Westminster. Having thus succeeded in maintaining their two cardinal principles of a right to competition, and power to prevent competition being defeated by amalgamation, and the minor objections having been disposed of in a satisfactory manner, the Vestry assented to the making of the Order in the terms agreed. The Order was made by the Board of Trade, and 55 submitted in the usual manner to Parliament for confirmation, when, owing to unexpected opposition by another Electric Lighting Company, and the lateness of the period of the Session, it was found impossible to proceed, and the Order dropped. The promoters then applied to the Vestry for consent to apply for a licence to bridge over the interval that must necessarily elapse before the Order could be confirmed by Parliament. The Vestry gave their consent to an application for a licence in the terms of the Order as finally settled, but other applications for licences dealing with very large areas of supply having been made in the meantime, the Board of Trade decided not to proceed with any of the licences, but to leave all the applications then pending to be dealt with by Provisional Order, so that the important questions of area and supply might be decided subject to the revision of a Select Committee of one of the Houses of Parliament, whereas the granting of a Licence by the Board of Trade is final and does not require Parliamentary Authority. The South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company (now the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company) are promoting a private Bill in the present Session of Parliament for power to supply electricity on similar terms and conditions to the Provisional Order as settled, and the Vestry have resolved to support the Bill. Following the same principles as in the case of the abovementioned Provisional Order, the Vestry assented to the St. James's and Pall Mall Electric Light Company applying to the Board of Trade for a licence in similar terms. This application was granted, and a licence accordingly issued. The central station of this Company in Mason's Yard is 56 proaching completion, and consent has teen given to the laying of mains for the lighting of Burlington Arcade and certain other streets and places. The area of supply of this Company is coterminous with the boundary of the Parish. Applications were received from three other Companies, the London Electric Supply Corporation, the House to House Electric Light Supply Company, and the Westminster Electric Supply Corporation. As the first-mentioned Company are already supplying electric light in the Parish, although outside the provisions of the Act, the Vestry decided not to offer any opposition to the granting of a Provisional Order to them, subject to certain conditions, as the withdrawal of that Company might cause at least a temporary inconvenience to such of the parishioners as are drawing their supply of light from them. These conditions not being accepted, the Vestry will object to an order beinggranted to the Company. As regards the applications from the other Companies, in view of the small area of the Parish, the loss and annoyance that would result from the unnecessarily frequent disturbance of the streets arising from an unduly large number of Companies at work in the same area, the probability of an increased charge for the light that would be caused by an excessive expenditure of capital in duplicating mains unnecessarily, and the precautions adopted for securing competition, the Vestry have decided not to assent to the introduction of any further general installations into the Parish at present. STREETS PARTLY SITUATE IN OTHER PARISHES. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 6th March, 1857, placing that portion of Oxford 57 Street which is situate in the Parish of St. James under the jurisdiction of the Vestry of St. Marylebone for all the purposes of the Metropolis Local Management Act. The cost of lighting, paving, cleansing, watering, &c., that portion °f the thoroughfare is ascertained annually and paid by the Vestry. By an Order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, dated the 10th August, 1866, specified sections of the following thoroughfares are placed under the exclusive management of the Vestries of St. James and St. George, Hanover Square, respectively, throughout the entire width thereof, instead of according to the actual Parish Boundary, viz.:—Regent Street, Piccadilly, Burlington Gardens, St. James's Street, and Park Place. No payment is made by either Vestry to the other under this Order, the exchange of area beingregarded as an equivalent. An order was made by the Metropolitan Board of Works on the 21st December, 1883, placing so much of the carriageway of Wardour Street as lies south of Meard's Court under the exclusive management of the Vestry for the purposes of cleansing and maintenance, and the remainder of the street under the exclusive management, for the same purposes, of the Strand District Board. An arrangement made some years since with the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields for the apportionment of Coventry Street as regards the cleansing and paving, in consequence of the boundary line being somewhat irregular, is still in force. PAVING AND DRAINAGE WORKS. Most of the paving and drainage works during the past year consisted of maintenance and repair. A few streets were 58 paved with asphalte under contract by the French Asphalte Company, and a small quantity of wood paving was executed by Messrs. Mowlem and Co., whose tenders were accepted in open competition. Further details of the various paving and drainage works carried out during the year will be found in the Surveyor's Report, commencing on page 93. MAP OF UNDERGROUND MAINS, PIPES, &c. In view of the increasing number of authorities having statutory authority to utilise the streets for the laying of mains, the Vestry applied to the various Companies and others so authorised for a copy of the map of their mains, pipes, &c., laid under the streets in this Parish for office useSome of the Companies complied with this request, and the others gave their assent to an officer of the Vestry taking a copy of the maps. The Yestry thereupon instructed their Surveyor to take a copy of the maps not supplied, in order that they may be in possession of full information with regard to underground works in the Parish. REFUGES. The following is a list of Refuges in the Parish :— Great Marlborough Street. Haymarket, South end. Pall Mall, by the United Service Club. ,, by the Athenaeum Club. ,, by St. James's Palace. „ by the Haymarket. Piccadilly, by St. James's Street. ,, by Burlington House. ,, by Vestry Hall. „ by Piccadilly Circus. „ by the Haymarket. 59 Piccadilly Circus (2 Refuges).

Five of these have been formed during the year. CONSTRUCTION OF VAULTS. The following regulations have been made in regard to the construction of vaults under footways :— 1. That plans and sections of proposed vaults be submitted and deposited with the Vestry. 2. That no deviation of such plan as sanctioned be made during the execution of the work, without the consent of the Vestry. 3. That all walls and arches be at least one brick, or nine inches thick. 4. That the space from the upper surface of the pavement to the outside of the vault be in no case less than three feet. 5. That no vault be allowed to project beyond the outside line of kerb where the footway is ten feet or more in width, and in no case shall the outside of the brickwork be carried nearer than three feet six inches to the centre line of the carriageway. 60 SANITARY. It will be seen on reference to the Report of the Medical Officer of Health, commencing on page 149, and the appendices thereto, that continuous attention has been paid to the abatement and removal of nuisances. It is impossible, however, to convey any accurate idea of the extent or value of sanitary work by the mere tabulation of figures. The most satisfactory proof of the value of this department of the Vestry's work is afforded by the reduction in the rate of mortality in the Parish since the creation of a sanitary department some thirty years since. Without here further entering into details, it may be remarked that the Medical Officer of Health reports that the death rate of the parish was 12.96 per 1,000 for the year 1888, as compared with a rate of 18'5 for the whole Metropolis. The cases of fever were unusually numerous during the year, but were chiefly infantile in character and marked by a very low rate of mortality. Thus, 2 cases of small-pox, 59 of scarlet fever, 11 of enteric or typhoid fever, and 2 of diphtheria, came under the knowledge of the sanitary officers, but only 9 deaths were attributable to these diseases. Two officers have been constantly engaged in the work of inspection with a view to detecting and removing nuisances, but the Vestry are still more anxious to prevent unsanitary conditions which give rise to nuisances. With this object they once more appeal to the parishioners for intelligent co-operation, especially to such as by their avocations are brought into contact with residents in the poorer and more crowded districts. The Vestry will be glad at all times to receive early information of any nuisance or 61 supposed nuisance. It is not absolutely necessary that the name and address of the informant should be given in all cases, although it is very desirable that this should be done where possible, in order to save loss of time in fruitless inquiry. Another and most valuable mode of assisting in maintaining: a high degree of public health is for each householder to insist upon scrupulous cleanliness being observed in the premises under his control. It cannot be too strongly urged that proper precautions against infection will also do much to ensure immunity from sickness generally. The great preventive of disease is cleanliness—cleanliness in living, cleanliness of person, and cleanliness of surroundings. The Yestry, as the local Sanitary Authority, are constantly striving after this condition of things, but unless the parishioners generally heartily cooperate in their several spheres, a great part of the work of the Yestry will be rendered nugatory. As the London County Council would appear to have power to appoint a Medical Officer of Health for the whole Metropolis, whose duties, it is assumed, would be to collate the vital statistics of all London for the information of the local Officers, the Yestry have instructed their Medical Officer of Health to prepare a detailed report on the sanitary condition of the Parish for the information of the Council. WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES. A communication was received from the Yestry of Clerkenwell, suggesting that Water Companies, and failing them the Local Sanitary Authorities, should have power to repair defective fittings to premises provided with a constant supply of 62 water, and recover from the owner of the property the cost thereby incurred. The Vestry concurred in this suggestion. COWSHEDS, DAIRIES, AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. There are now no cowsheds in the Parish, and only two slaughter houses. The licensing of slaughter houses in the Metropolis has passed, by the Local Government Act, 1888, from the local Justices to the London County Council, and at the annual Petty Sessions in October for the renewal of the licences, the Vestry called attention to this fact, and asked the Justices to intimate to the licensees that they might expect their licences now to lapse. It may not be inopportune to recall the fact that as far back as 1844 Parliament expressed an opinion adversely to the continuance of slaughter houses in the Metropolis, and enacted that they should absolutely cease 30 years later. Eleven years afterwards slaughter houses were placed under sanitary supervision, and held subject to an annual licence, and on the approach of the limit specified in the Act of 1844, a further Act was passed placing existing slaughter houses under stricter regulations, and prohibiting the establishment of such places anew, except under such conditions as are prohibitory, so far, at least, as central London is concerned. The Vestry are of opinion that the transfer of the licensing of slaughter houses from Justices of the Peace to a popularly elected body would be an opportune time to abolish all slaughter houses which now exist in contiguity to dwellings, especially in crowded neighbourhoods. The Vestry communicated these views to the Metropolitan Board of Works, in order that they might be placed before the London County Council when the latter fully entered upon their duties. 63 REMOVAL OF THE INFECTIOUS SICK TO HOSPITALS. The Vestry were gratified at receiving an intimation, in the month of September, that the Local Government Board assented to the admission of small-pox and fever patients to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on the certificate of a sanitary officer or a private medical practitioner, without the intervention of poor-law officers. The Vestry were further informed that it had been the intention of the President of the Local Government Board to introduce a Bill to remove any doubt as to the legality of this practice during the past year, but that he was prevented by other circumstances. In the meantime, however, the Board will remit any surcharge based on the absence of an order from a Relieving Officer, which the Auditor may make, and thus a principle for which the Vestry have been striving for years—the removal of the infectious sick to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals on sanitary grounds—has virtually been conceded. An epidemic of diphtheria called attention to the desirability of the Asylums Board making provision for the reception and treatment of patients suffering from this highly infectious disorder and needing isolation. The Vestry joined other Sanitary Authorities in representing to the Local Government Board the advisability of the Asylums Board being authorised to make such provision, which they would be willing to do if their powers were clear. The Board replied that their power to authorise the Asylums Board to receive patients suffering from diphtheria was not free from doubt, but that a Bill will be introduced next session to deal with the question, and that in the meantime they will be prepared to remit the surcharge of any expenses properly incurred in the treatment of such patients. 64 REGISTERED HOUSES. It is satisfactory to note that the tenement houses registered under the sanitary regulations of the Vestry have not occasioned any special trouble during the year. One house (7, Marlborough Row) has been registered during the year. ST. JAMES'S DWELLINGS. This property has been fairly well let during the whole year.

The Factory and Workshops Act. 1883, having tranferred to the Local Sanitary Authorities the duty of inspecting retail bakehouses, the following abstract of the requirements of the law with regard to the cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and sanitary condition of retail bakehouses, is given for the information of parishioners :— 1. A bakehouse to be in conformity with the Acts relating to retail bakehouses, is subject to the following requirements :— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state, and free from effluvia arising from any drain, privy, or other nuisance. (b) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be injurious to the health of the persons employed, and shall be ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, so far as practicable, all the gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process that may be injurious to health. (c) The ceilings or tops of the bakehouse and all passages and staircases must either be painted with oil, or varnished, or limewashed, or partly painted or varnished, and partly 65 limewashed. If painted or varnished, the surface must be covered with three coats of paint or varnish, and renewed once at least in every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap once at least in every six months. Limewashing is to be renewed once at least in every six months. 2. No place on the same level with the bakehouse and forming part of the same building may be used as a sleeping place, unless it is effectually separated from the bakehouse by a partition extending from the floor to the ceiling, and has an external glazed window of at least nine superficial feet in area, of which at least four-and-a-half feet are made to open for ventilation. 3. A bakehouse must not be in such a state as to be on sanitary grounds unfit for use or occupation as a bakehouse. 4. No child, young person, or woman may be employed in a bakehouse, contrary to the provisions of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1878. Penalties are provided in the event of an infringement of the law; the bakehouses brought into use after the 31st of May, 1883, are subject to certain further requirements. The bakehouses in the Parish (33 in number) are under frequent inspection by the Sanitary Officers of the Vestry. It has not been found necessary to take proceedings against the occupiers of any premises of that description during the past year. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. The following is a list of the articles purchased by the Inspector, and submitted to the Public Analyst, appointed by the Yestry, during the year :— Coffee 13 Milk 27 Mustard 6 Pepper 12 Tea 6 64 F 66 Five samples were reported by the Analyst to be adulterated, and three samples of milk to be of such poor quality as to suggest adulteration; proceedings were taken in four cases, a penalty varying from 5s. to 20s. being imposed in each case. The cost incurred by the Vestry for the year in respect of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act is as follows : — £ s. d. Allowance to Analyst 75 0 0 Purchase of Samples, &c 0 13 7 75 13 7 Fines recovered 2 0 0 Net cost to the Parish £73 13 7 SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS. Summonses have been taken out for the following offences :— Adulteration 4 Unsanitary condition of premises 8 Erecting hoard without licence 1 Non-compliance with notice to alter projections 1 Causing obstruction, depositing building material in street, &c 27 Non-payment of cost of reinstating pavement, &c. 1 Total 42 Fines were inflicted in 23 cases, orders under the Nuisances Removal Acts were made in 2 cases, the paving claim was settled before the hearing of the summons, 14 summonses were withdrawn on payment of costs, and 2 were withdrawn unconditionally. It is satisfactory to note that in all cases where summary proceedings were commenced, either the object aimed at was achieved, or a penalty was inflicted. 67 DISORDERLY HOUSES. Several complaints have formed the subject of investigation, and in many instances a preliminary notice from the Vestry Clerk has proved effectual in ridding premises of tenants who used their houses or rooms for an improper purpose. Only one prosecution has been undertaken during the year; in this case, fines amounting in all to £22 were inflicted, with £5 5s. costs. The Vestry are glad to acknowledge the assistance afforded by the Police in taking observation of suspected or alleged brothels. It remains to be seen, however, whether the new system of Police observation by constables on the beat will be as effectual in some cases as the former practice of appointing plain clothes men for the special duty. DRINKING FOUNTAIN. There is but one Drinking Fountain in the Parish, that in the Churchyard Wall in Piccadilly. This Fountain was erected, and is maintained, without cost to the Vestry. CONVENIENCES, PICCADILLY CIRCUS. The Vestry invited five selected firms of Sanitary Engineers to submit designs and estimates for the construction of Public Conveniences for both sexes under the smaller of the two paved spaces at Piccadilly Circus, the condition of competition being that in lieu of offering any premium, the Vestry undertook to give the contract for the work to the firm whose design and estimate might be approved. All five firms responded to the invitation, and the design of Messrs. Finch and Co., of 82, Belvedere Road, Lambeth, most nearly meeting the requirements of the Vestry was accepted, sub ject f 2 68 to a few unimportant modifications, and conditionally on the plan meeting the approval of the Commissioners of Woods. Mr. H.J. Treadwell was appointed special Surveyor to advise the Vestry as to the modifications of the accepted design, and to supervise the carrying out of the work. Upon the designs being laid before Colonel Kingscote, Commissioner of Woods, for approval, he submitted for the consideration of the Vestry a plan for the re-arrangement of the open space at the Circus, providing for one large circular space at the end of Shaftesbury Avenue (beneath which, it was suggested, the Conveniences might be placed), with smaller circular spaces or refuges at various points. This plan did not at all commend itself to the Vestry, as not only would the expense be enormous, but the position of the Conveniences on an island, so to speak, out of the general line of traffic, would be of much less use, and more difficult of access, than in the position originally proposed. The Vestry accordingly did not entertain the plan submitted by Colonel Kingscote. Objection was then taken by a few residents in the neighbourhood to the carrying out of this plan, and some correspondence with the Office of Woods ensued. Eventually Colonel Kingscote stated that, in face of the objection taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works and the neighbours, he declined to give anv approval of the scheme, but that as the Vestry appeared to be still of opinion that the Conveniences are needed in the interests of the public, he would not oppose their construction in accordance with the drawings submitted to him, subject to certain specified amendments. These amendments were agreed to by the Vestry, and a contract accordingly entered into with Messrs. Finch and Co. for the underground portion of the work, for the sum of £2,488, the 69 superstructure being entrusted to the undermentioned firms :— £ s. d. Granite Work, Messrs. Fenning & Co. 465 0 0 Lamp Columns, Messrs. Macfarlane &c Co. 175 0 0 Lanterns. Messrs. Sugg & Co 59 8 0 Fixing, Messrs. Peto 87 0 0 Including professional charges, the total cost of the work Will amount to about £3,500. It is hoped that the Conveniences will be completed and opened to the public by Midsummer Day. URINALS. The following is a list of public urinals erected and main tained by the Vestry :— Situation. No. of Compartments. Situation. No. of Compartments. Bridle Lane 3 King's Arms Yard 3 Broad Street 9 Mason's Yard 3 Coach and Horses Yard rd 4 Bamilies Street 4 Cork Mews 2 Vine Street 7 Ham Yard 3 Wells Street 5 The adoption of the trough system in the Broad Street Urinal having proved highly satisfactory, the same system has been applied to the Urinals throughout the Parish, with considerable advantage as regards the cost of flushing. The cost of applying the trough system was £93 18s., and the economy in the use of water is so great, that the cost of the alteration will be saved in little more than a year's consumption of water. The Urinal in Cork Mews has been reconstructed, in order to afford greater privacy, at a cost of £17 10s., and it is intended to replace the old Urinal in Mason's Yard, which was removed for the erection of the Electric Lighting Station, with one of more modern construction. The cost of the latter will be partially borne by the Electric Lighting Company. 70 The cost of maintaining the Urinals during the year is as follows :— £ s. d. Water for flushing 138 19 5 Wages for cleansing 62 8 0 £201 7 5 CAB RANKS. The following is a list of the Cab Ranks in this Parish authorised by the Commissioner of Police :— No. of Places. Broad Street 12 Great Marlborough Street 15 Haymarket (two standings) 32 Piccadilly, by the Albany 11 Begent Street, opposite Vigo Street 3 St. James's Square 14 St. James's Street 30 Shaftesbury Avenue 25 Waterloo Place 3 The only rank which has a Cabmen's Shelter is that in St. James's Square. The shelter was provided and is maintained at private expense. PILLAR LETTER BOXES. With the assent of the Vestry, pillar letter boxes have been erected by the Postmaster-General in the under-mentioned thoroughfares :— Western District. Albany. Beak Street. Brewer Street. Burlington Gardens. Coventry Street. 71 Golden Square. Great Marlborough Street. Little Pulteney Street. New Burlington Street. Piccadilly, by the Egyptian Hall. Regent Street, by Hanover Street. Regent Street, Heddon Street. Regent Street, by Piccadilly Circus. Regent Street, Quadrant. Sackville Street. South-Western District. Duke Street, by Ryder Street. Haymarket, by Jermyn Street. Jermyn Street, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by the War Office. Pall Mall, by Waterloo Place. Park Place. St. James's Square, by Charles Street. St. James's Street, by Bennett Street. FIXED POINTS. The following list of fixed points, where a constable may be found at all times, is given for the information of Parishioners :— Burlington Gardens, by the Bank. Oxford Circus. Piccadilly Circus, East side. Piccadilly Circus, West side. Regent Street, by Beak Street. Regent Street, by the County Fire Office, 7 p.m. till 3. a.m. Regent Street by Vigo Street. St. James's Street (south end). Wardour Street, by Little Pulteney Street. FIRE BRIGADE. There is only one Fire Brigade Station in the Parish, viz., in Great Marlborough Street, but other stations in adjoining Parishes are available in cases of an outbreak of fire. 72 Fire alarms in telegraphic communication with Fire Brigade Stations have been erected by the Metropolitan Board of Works in the undermentioned thoroughfares :— Golden Square. Piccadilly, by St. James's Church. Pall Mall, by Marlborough House. Fire escapes with attendants are nightly stationed in Golden Square and next the Parish Church, Piccadilly. MUSIC AND DANCING LICENCES. In accordance with the Standing Orders of the Court of Quarter Sessions, notices were given to the Vestry in the month of August, by intending applicants for Music and Dancing Licences, as follows :— Bignell, Robert Richard (Executors of), The Trocadero, 7 and 8, Great Windmill Street, for Music and Dancing. Bratt, Edwin, 6, Swallow Street, for Music only. Dawkins, Edwin, Willis's Rooms, 26, King Street, St. James's, for Music and Dancing. Highton, Theodore Arthur, Piccadilly Art Galleries, and Prince'sHall, for Music and Dancing. Leslie, George, St. James's Hall, Piccadilly, and Regent Street, for Music and Dancing. Maskelyne, John Nevil, the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, for Music only. Monico, James and Battista, Cafe Monico, for Music only. Spiers, Felix William, The Criterion, 221, Piccadilly, for Music and Dancing. Villiers, Edwin Adam, The London Pavilion Music Hall, Piccadilly, for Music only. A licence was granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions in each case. 73 BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Among the Bills that have received attention during the year are the following:— Session 1888. Advertisement Rating. Electric Lighting Act (1882) Amendment. Employers' Liability for Injuries to Workmen. Employers' Liability Act (1880) Amendment. Franchise Extension. Housing of Working Classes (London). Leaseholders (Purchase of fee simple). Local Government (England and Wales). Local Government (England and Wales) Electors. Metropolitan Board of Works Commission. Metropolitan Streets Regulation. National Debt Conversion. Official Trustee. Personal Property Exemption. Public Health (Prevention of Infectious Diseases). Public Trustee. Rating of Machinery. Reformatory Schools Act (1866) Amendment. Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sunday. School Board for London (Pensions). Technical Instruction. Trust Companies. Weights and Measures. Session 1889. Horseflesh (Sale for Food). London Central (Subway) Railway. London Hydraulic Power Company. Metropolitan Electric Supply Company. Metropolitan Improvements. Public Libraries Act (1853) Amendment. Rating of Machinery. 74 Action was taken with regard to such of these Bills as seemed to require attention as follows:— Petition presented in Favour.—Advertisement Rating Bill, the object of which was to make buildings and hoardings used for advertising purposes liable to the local rates in respect of the advertisements affixed thereto. Approved.—A general approval of the principle of the following Bills was conveyed to the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., particular clauses being, in the opinion of the Vestry, open to amendment:—Public Health (Prevention of Infectious Diseases), Technical Instruction, and Leaseholders (Purchase of Fee Simple). Opposed.—The Vestry requested the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith, M.P., to oppose the following Bills, to which the Vestry objected either in principle, or as creating a cumbrous or needlessly costly machinery to effect their purpose:—Personal Property Exemption, Housing of Working Classes (London), Employers' Liability Act, 1882, Amendment (No. 2), School Board for London (Pensions). With regard to the Official Trustee, Public Trustee, and Trust Companies Bills, it appeared to the Vestry that the adoption of some kind of Corporate Trustee would be of advantage, as tending to relieve individuals of burdensome trusts and personal liability, and they therefore suggested to the Rt. Hon. W. H. Smith that the three Bills should be referred to a Select Committee wi th a view to legislation on the responsibility of the Government. There was, however, some technical difficulty in adopting this course, owing to all the Bills not being introduced in the same House, and the suggestion was not acted upon. 75 The views of the Vestry upon other Bills will be found on page 75 as regards the Local Government Bills, and the London Central (Subway) Railway, and on page 55 as regards the Metropolitan Electric Supply Bill. PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES, SESSION 1889. In the month of December the promoters of the proposed Central London (Subway) Railway deposited with the Vestry, in accordance with the standing orders of Parliament, a notice (accompanied by a plan) of their intention to apply for Parliamentary powers to authorise the construction of the Railway. The railway would commence at the north end of St. James's Street, and run underground along Piccadilly, Shaftesbury Avenue, and Holborn to Holborn Circus. The plan and the Bill to be introduced into Parliament, together with a model prepared by the promoters, were carefully considered by the Vestry, and having regard to the immense disturbance to traffic and business which the construction of the railway would cause, the exceptional powers which the promoters sought to acquire, the long period named for carrying out the work, the fact that the Bill did not make it compulsory upon the Company to construct the railway and subways for pipes and sewers according to the model, and to other considerations, the Vestry decided to petition against the Bill in order, at least, to obtain a locus standi to secure the insertion of clauses in the Bill for the protection of the parishioners, even if it were not found necessary to oppose the progress of the Bill altogether . LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT, 1888. This Act, which has municipalized County Government throughout England, received very careful consideration when 76 it was passing through Parliament. The Parliamentary Bills Committee presented a lengthy report, suggesting several amendments. This Report was adopted by the Vestry, and a copy forwarded to the Government, and the Vestry are gratified to find that some of their suggested amendments are embodied in the Act. It is unnecessary now to refer in detail to the clauses of the Bill to which exception was taken, but the followingextracts from the Committee's Report are given as embody ing the views of the Vestry on questions of principle relating to Local Government, which must be hereafter dealt with by Parliament. As regards the Local Government Electors Act, your Committee are of opinion tbat none of the clauses call for special comment from a Metropolitan point of view; they regret, however, that advantage was not taken of the opportunity to provide that the Register of Electors, which is to be made up and used in the election of members of the proposed County Councils, should be used in all other local elections. At present, scarcely any two elections of Local Boards are conducted on the same principle, and not only is much needless cost thus incurred in the preparation of special lists of voters for the Election of Members of the School Board and Boards of Guardians, but varying franchises and modes of election cause considerable trouble to those ratepayers who are desirous of performing their duty of citizenship in the election of members of the various public boards. If a number of independent authorities are to be retained (and on this point your Committee submit their opinion a little later), the use of the County Boll of Electors should be extended to Boards of Guardians, School Boards, Metropolitan Vestries, and all other Authorities elected by the Ratepayers, and all elections should be taken by ballot under precisely the same system. This enactment would abolish plural and proxy voting for Guardians, and cumulative voting for School Boards; it would, as already stated, save the expense of preparing special lists of voters, and simplify the procedure at local elections by introducing one uniform system. Your Committee are much impressed with the large proportion of ratepayers who at present abstain from taking part in the Local Elections, and believe that much of the existing apathy is due to the difficulty of comprehending the different modes in which the elections of local bodies are conducted. 77 They would, therefore, earnestly press the importance of one uniform register of electors, and one uniform mode of procedure being adopted for the election of the various local authorities. Simplification and unification seem, to your Committee, to form the very foundation of a really effecti?e reform in Local Government. Local Government Bill.— Clause 76 (sec. 75 of Act).— Under this clause, the usual day of election of County Councillors will be November 1st. Seeing that the register then in force will practically have been made up to the loth July in the previous year, and having regard to the migratory habits of masses of voters, especially in some districts of the metropolis, it is apparent that the register of voters will then be in a most imperfect condition in consequence of the changes of tenancy in the meantime. Your Committee are accordingly of opinion that the elections should take place in the month of March, when the register will be in a much better state, being then but eight months old. Clause 91 (sec. 93 of Act).— This clause your Committee consider retrogressive, inasmuch as it would perpetuate the existing anomalous arrangements with regard to the City and Metropolitan Police Forces. Your Committee are strongly of opinion that this clause should be amended, by placing the police force of the whole County of London under the control of the County Council. Your Committee would remind the Vestry that it has already expressed its opinion on this subject by the following resolution, which was passed on the 10th May:— That this Vestry do concur in the opinion expressed by the Vestry of St. Luke that no measure dealing with the local government of London will be satisfactory which does not give the control of the police to the municipal authority, on the principle that " the keeping of the peace of a town should be in the hands of its inhabitants." four Committee have considered the omission from the Bill of provisions which, in their opinion, are essential to the construction of a system of local government on a sound and lasting basis. Thus, regarded specially from a Metropolitan point of view, the Bill does not abolish a single obsolete authority; does not rectify overlapping boundaries of areas for various local jurisdictions; does not unify the mode of electing members of local bodies ; does not unify the qualifications of members of such bodies; 78 does not unify the varying franchises of electors for local purposes; does not economise the cost of rate collecting, by providing for the levying of one consolidated rate for all purposes in each local area, but maintains as at present, in many parishes, duplicate rating authorities; and does not, in the slightest degree, remove the anomaly of Poor Law authorities exercising sanitary and municipal functions, although there may be local sanitary and municipal authorities within the same area. Your Committee, then, can only regard the Local Government Bill' now before Parliament as a first and small instalment of an effectual reform of local government, which must be supplemented by amending legislation at an early date. PROPOSED FORMATION OF DISTRICT COUNCILS. The Vestry have approved the proposal of the Vestries of Islington and Fulham that the District Councils, which the Government propose to establish in the Metropolis, should have entrusted to them the power of making and collecting the rates, and that the Accounts of the Councils should be subject to an efficient audit on the lines of the Poor-law system. In the opinion of the Vestry, advantage should be taken of the establishment of District Councils to simplify and unify the administration of local affairs throughout the Metropolis. Effete and obsolete authorities, as well as diverse franchises and modes of election, should be abolished, and a District Council on a popular basis should be entrusted with all the powers of Local Government, Poorlaw administration alone excepted. Thus each district, or unit of administration, would be governed on precisely the same system, instead of, as at present, in very different manners; all the Local Boards would be elected by the same body of electors, and in the same manner; the Guardians of the Poor would be relieved of quasi-municipal duties, such as the registration of births and deaths, vaccination, &c., and the 79 District Council would be charged with the administration of all matters relating, directly and indirectly, to the public health. The advantages likely to accrue from a complete re-organisation of local government on these lines are so obvious, that the Yestry trust that the opportunity of effecting a complete reform will not be lost. “MAIN ROADS.” At the request of the Chelsea Vestry, three members were appointed to attend a conference on the subject of the future maintenance of “Main Roads” in London. The Local Government Act, 1888 (sec. 11), transfers the maintenance and repair of main roads to the County Council, power being reserved to the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis (sec. 41) either to retain the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing the main roads, or to agree with the Council to carry out the work. A “Main Road” for the purpose of these enactments is either a road which was disturnpiked between the 31st December, 1870, and August, 1878, or one which for sufficient cause has been declared by the County Authority to be a main road, and as such repairable at the expense of the County. At present there are no “Main Roads” in St. James's, and the total length of such roads in the whole Metropolis is under 12 miles, but if the County Council exercise the power vested in them and declare the leading arteries of traffic to be “Main Roads,” and therefore maintainable either entirely or partially at the cost of the whole Metropolis instead of the Parish, it is evident that the burden of local taxation will be largely shifted. The extent and manner in which the burden is shifted will depend partly on the principle adopted by the County Council in declaring 80 thoroughfares to be “Main Roads,” and partly on the course adopted by the local authorities with regard to retaining the roads under their own control. It was to agree upon some common course of action and the adoption of a general principle that the Conference at Chelsea was held. Resolutions were adopted at this Conference, advising the various local authorities to apply to the County Council to make orders declaring thoroughfares, being a means of communication with other districts, or leading to railway stations, or being omnibus routes, or largely used for metro politan as distinct from local traffic, to be “Main Roads,” and to claim to retain the management of such main roads under local control. The course to be adopted by this Vestry was still under consideration at Lady Day. SCHOOL BOARD ELECTORAL DISTRICTS. Upon the invitation of the St. Pancras Vestry, this Vestry appointed three of their members to attend a Conference in support of the assimilation of the School Board Electoral Districts to the Parliamentary areas. The Vestry have on former occasions objected to the Parliamentary area being adopted for School Board Electoral Districts, mainly from an apprehension that School Board Elections would then probably be conducted on political lines, but as the Parliamentary area has since been adopted as the Electoral District for the County Council, and it would be an obvious advantage if the Electoral Districts of all the Metropolitan Authorities were uniform, this objection has been removed. 81 At the Conference referred to, it was decided to appoint a deputation to the Education Department, to urge the introduction of a Bill into Parliament to reconstitute the School Board Electoral Districts on the basis of the Parliamentary area, and the Vestry requested their delegates to the Conference to join the deputation. The Education Department, however, have declined to receive the proposed deputation at present. LONDON PARKS AND WORKS ACT, 1887. Under this Act the maintenance of certain Parks and other places was transferred from the Office of Her Majesty's Works to the Metropolitan Board of Works, the financial effect being to relieve the National Exchequer of the cost, and to place the burden on the Metropolitan ratepayer. It may not be generally known that estates were attached to Battersea Park and Westminster Bridge, the income arising therefrom being applied to the maintenance of the Park and Bridge respectively. These estates the Government retain. By the London Government Bill, which was introduced into the House of Commons by Sir William Harcourt in 1884, it was proposed to transfer to the Metropolitan Municipal Council, the Parks, &c., subsequently dealt with by the Act of 1887, and Brompton Cemetery, together with the estates and income attached thereto. A Treasury Minute of the 14th February, 1884, represented the following as the annual incomes attached to the properties proposed to be transferred:— £ Brompton Cemetery (net) 5,550 Westminster Bridge Estate 5,400 Battersea Estate (actual and estimated) 7,500 £18,450 g 82 There was, at that time, a debt and accumulated interest amounting to £190,000 due to the Treasury in respect of Battersea Park; this sum the Treasury proposed wholly to remit. In the year 1888, a statement was obtained from the Treasury showing the present capital value of the property originally belonging to Westminster Bridge and Battersea Park, and retained by the Government, to be as follows;— £ Westminster Bridge Estate 245,000 Battersea Park Estate 156.000 £401,000 The balance of loan and accumulated interest in respect of Battersea Park Estate had in the meantime been reduced to £170,000. A comparison of the terms on which the Government proposed to transfer the Parks, &c., to the Metropolis in 1884, and the terms upon which the transfer was actually effected in 1887, will show that by the alteration in the terms of transfer, the Metropolis actually loses an income of £18,450 per annum, with the reversion to a considerable prospective increase, owing to the almost inevitable growth in value of the freehold estate at Battersea. As the cost of maintaining the Parks and Bridge transferred exceeds the income thus lost, the Vestry felt that they had good grounds for urging the Treasury to re-open the question with a view to reverting to the terms of settlement proposed in 1884. A memorial was accordingly presented to the Lords of the Treasury, and a deputation was appointed to wait upon the Right Hon, W. H. Smith, First Lord, and after a short 83 respondence, in the course of which it was stated that the Westminster Bridge Estate had been so appropriated as to preclude its being handed over, the Lords of the Treasury finally replied that they could not re-open the question. The subject is one that affects the whole Metropolis, and the Vestry have accordingly directed the attention of all the Metropolitan Vestries to the matter at issue. A copy of the correspondence with the Treasury was also forwarded to the Metropolitan Board of Works. FIRE PREVENTION. The occurrence of six deaths at a fire in Edgware Road in the month of June naturally attracted public attention to the means available for the protection of life and property from. fire. The fire in question broke out about the time that the hours of attendance of the men in charge of the fire escapes expired (6 a.m.), and the Vestry suggested to the Metropolitan Board of Works that the escapes should always be kept in readiness, and in charge of a responsible attendant, day and night. The Board replied that the funds at their disposal for Fire Brigade purposes would not admit of the large increase in staff which this proposal would involve, but in order to afford additional protection at one particular part of the day, fire-escape men would in future commence and end their period of duty one hour later, that is to say, their hours would be from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. With a view to ascertain to what extent property in this parish in particular was exposed to risk of fire, and in what manner precautions were adopted or protection afforded irrespective of the Fire Brigade, the Vestry addressed a circular to each ratepayer inviting information on the sub- g 2 84 ject. The replies to this circular formed the basis of a report which was distributed throughout the parish, and also brought under the notice of the Government, the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the various Local Authorities in the Metropolis. The report having been so widely circulated, it is unnecessary to reproduce it here, but the following extract being of almost universal application, will bear repetition:— In the absence of an ideally perfect construction, much can be done in the way of preventing an outbreak of fire by a continuous and careful supervision. Thus, flues should be kept clean, and any defect promptly remedied; gas fittings, especially such as are jointed, should be maintained in perfect order; in business houses, especially, gas brackets should invariably be fixtures, and unjointed; in many cases gas pipes of soft composition, so commonly used, might with advantage be replaced with hard metal, for a neglected small escape of gas would then be less likely to increase rapidly; gas lights in workrooms, &c., should be protected by iron wire guards, and these guards periodically cleaned, otherwise inflammable particles lodging on the wire may catch light. Some of the replies suggest that the gas should be shut off at the meter each night, but if this is done, care must be taken to see that the taps at the various jets are first turned out, or an escape of gas may result when the gas is turned on at the meter next day. The storage of oils, wood, and other inflammable articles should also receive careful attention. The careless use of lucifer matches is a fruitful cause of fire. The upsetting of lamps also causes many fires; this might be reduced by the general adoption of one or other of the different kinds of lamps which are automatically extinguished by the very act of upsetting; or by fitting a metal tube carrying the wick to the bottom of the oil receptacle, and thus preventing the accumulation of heated vapour in the oil chamber. A communication was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works with reference to several suggestions contained in the Report, some of which could not be adopted 85 without legislation; this communication was under consideration by a Committee at the close of the year on the 25th March. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS' OFFICERS. The following resolution was passed at a meeting of the Vestry held on the 14th March, and duly communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the County Council:— That this Vestry does not concur with the action of the Metropolitan Board of Works in increasing the salaries of twentyone of their officials, and in granting exorbitant pensions to their Clerk and Engineer, and trusts that the County Council of London will not consider themselves bound by the action of the Metropolitan Board of Works. SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. In view of the approaching triennial Election of the School Board for London, the Vestry prepared and circulated in the month of June a pamphlet containing further Remarks on the Administration and Expenditure of the Board, in continuation of the Vestry's Remarks published in 1885. As a copy of this pamphlet was sent to each ratepayer, it is unnecessary to refer to it here further than to say that it showed that while an appreciable economy had been effected, the discrepancy in the cost per scholar in the London Board Schools, as compared with the cost in London Voluntary Schools and Provincial Board Schools, was still enormous. As the Election drew near, a Committee of the whole Vestry was appointed to consider what further action it might be expedient to take, and the following Report was presented to the Vestry, adopted, and ordered to be circulated among the Rating Authorities of the Metropolis:— 86 Your Committee have to report that, proceeding upon the reference by the Vestry of the 11th October instant, they have considered what action it may be expedient to take in view of the approaching School Board Election, with the object of obtaining a further reduction of the Rate. Your Committee would, in the first place, remark that they are far from attaching primary importance to a mere saving of money. They most strongly feel that the best interests of the ratepayers will be more truly served by the efficient training of the rising generation, even at an increased cost, than by an indiscriminate reduction of the rate. But your Committee, after carefully examining the expenditure of the School Board, are convinced that, not with standing a considerable diminution, the expenditure of the Board will admit of further reduction without in the least degree injuring the great work of educating the masses. Your Committee would further recall the fact that it was at the instance of the St. James's Vestry that a Conference of the Rating Authorities in the Metropolis was held at the Mansion House in April, 1885, when a general opinion was expressed that the expenditure of the School Board was excessive, and to that extent prejudicial to the cause of popular Education. It will be remembered that, as the Election of the School Board in 1885 drew near, the Vestry again took the initiative in convening a Conference of the Eating Authorities in the Westminster Division for tbe purpose of selecting and submitting. for the support of the ratepayers, candidates pledged to loyally administer the Elementary Education Acts with due regard to the circumstances of the mass of ratepayers who are called upon to pay the bulk of the cost of the Board School system of Education. Five Candidates were selected at this Conference, and four of them obtained seats at the Board. The Mansion House Conference, and the papers issued by the Vestry in connection therewith, it may be fairly assumed, had done much to direct public attention in other districts to the possibility of a retrenchment in the expenditure of the Board, without impairing the efficiency of the schools or impeding the work of the Board. However this may be, the result of 87 the Election throughout the Metropolis gave a small majority of members pledged to an economical administration, but sufficient to introduce two or three important reforms. Without enumerating these reforms, it may be sufficient to state that 53,000 more children are actually being taught in the Board Schools of London now than was the case three years ago, and that, although by the operation of the scale of salaries the cost of the teaching staff individually is somewhat higher, the amount of the precept on St. James's for the present year is less than in 1885 by no less than £1,283, the actual figures being, in 1885, £24,501 13s. 7d., and in 1888, £23,218 7s. 5d. That the standard of instruction has not been reduced is attested by the increased number of schools graded as "excellent" in the meantime. Thus, as is usually the case, economy and efficiency have gone hand in hand. If the expenditure of the Board had not been checked in 1885, it is probable that during the three years that have elapsed in the interval, between £8,000 and £10,000 would, upon a moderate estimate, have been extracted from the pockets of the ratepayers of this Parish alone, which has been wholly saved to them. The saving to the ratepayers of the Metropolis, as a whole, may be Computed at something like £400,000 for the three years. Your Committee mention these facts as fully proving the accuracy of the views of the Vestry in 1885 with regard to the expenditure of the Board being then unnecessarily lavish. With regard to the action to be taken for a further reduction of the rate, your Committee, while asserting in the most emphatic manner that it is the duty of the Vestry, as the body called upon to collect the School Board Kate, to protect the Ratepayers against an excessive demand by the Board, and asserting the right of the Vestry to critically examine the expenditure of the Board, feel that the Vestry cannot and ought not, in their corporate capacity, to interfere in the election of Members of the Board. At the same time it appears to your Committee that, in order to maintain, and, if possible, improve the position obtained at the last election, some organization is necessary to inform the general body of electors on the question at issue. Your Committee would therefore suggest that every facility should1 be afforded for the formation and meeting of a Committee of Ratepayers, and that the Vestry Hall should accordingly be placed at the disposal of such Committee. As regards the constitution of the Committee, in the absence of any better organization, Members of the various Public Boards in the Parish would seem to afford an excellent nucleus, fairly representing various views, and your Committee would therefore suggest that all members of such Boards willing to serve should form themselves into a Committee, with power to add to their number from time to time any parishioners or others interested in the cause of education or the. work of the London School Board, in order to select suitable Candidates and work for their election. It is of course to be understood that such a Committee would be an independent organization, entirely separate from the Vestry as a corporate body. All which your Committee submit. As a matter of information, it may be added that a representative Committee "was formed as suggested in the foregoing; Report, and agreed to support the five candidates who had been previously selected by a Ruri-decanal Committee of Clergy and representative laymen. The Election was held on the 26th November, and three (Rev. A. G. Bowman, Mr. Winnett, and Major-Gen. Sim) of the selected candidates were returned, the other two (Lord Colchester, and Mr. W. G. F. Cavendish Bentinck) being unsuccessful. Compared with former occasions, the last Election appears to have excited rather more interest than of late years. It is still, however, very unsatisfactory to find that only 13,645 voters out of a total of 35,000 (or not much more than onethird) took the trouble to record their votes. The following 88 89 statement illustrates the operation of the cumulative system of voting:— Voters. Votes. Bowman, Rev. A. G. 8,340 9,052 *Colchester, Lord 8,094 8,361 *Bentinck, W. G. F. C. 8,029 8,322 Sim, Major-Gen. C. A. 7,954 8,522 Winnett, William 7,742 8,693 Oxford, Rev. A. W. 4,021 11,282 Spink, H.N. B. 3,701 9,539 *Evans, Matilda M. 957 2,339 *Keevil, E. C. 331 433 It will thus be seen that owing to the operation of the cumulative vote, the candidate who headed the poll received the support of only about l-9th of the Electors, while two candidates who each received the support of nearly l-4th of the Electors failed to obtain a seat. DEATH OF THE EMPEROR FREDERICK. The Yestry received with deep regret the intelligence of the death of the German Emperor Frederick, son-in-law of Her Majesty the Queen, after a brief reign, and, on the 5th July, unanimously agreed to Addresses of Condolence in the following terms:— TO THE QUEEN'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. The humble and loyal Address of Condolence of the Vestrymen of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in Vestry assembled Most Gracious Sovereign,— We, your Majesty's loyal and dutiful subjects, the Rector, Churchwardens, and Elected Vestrymen of the Parish of St. James, within the Liberty of Westminster, in Vestry assembled, humbly desire to express to * Not elected. 90 your Majesty the deep sorrow with which we have received the sad intelligence of the great loss which your Majesty has sustained in the death of His Imperial Majesty Frederick William, German Emperor, King of Prussia. Allied as he was to your Majesty by ties of tenderest affection, the career of His Imperial Majesty could not fail to excite the respectful sympathy of your Majesty's loving subjects, more especially as between the peoples of the two nations there exist feelings of kinship cemented by many years of alliance and unbroken peace. But His Imperial Majesty so adorned, by his high qualities and manly virtues, the exalted station to which he was called as to command the admiration of all who observed his life. A beloved commander, ever solicitous of the necessities of his army, a brave leader, a generous adversary, he bore victory nobly and modestly, as in his later days he endured suffering heroically. Your Majesty has ever been pleased to permit your people to share in the domestic concerns of your Royal House, and now that a cloud of sorrow again overshadows your Majesty, we venture humbly to tender to your Majesty our sympathy and condolence, with an assurance of our fervent prayer to Almighty God for the happiness of your Majesty and every member of the Royal Family. Given under the Common Seal of the Vestry this fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty eight. (Signed) HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk. TO HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY VICTORIA, GERMAN EMPRESS, QUEEN OF PRUSSIA, PRINCESS ROYAL OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. The humble Address of Condolence and Sympathy of the Vestrymen of,the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in Vestry assembled. May it please your Majesty,— We, the Vestrymen of the Parish of St. James, Westminster, in Vestry assembled, humbly ask permission to approach your Imperial 91 Majesty with an expression of our deep sorrow at the great loss which you have sustained by the death of His Imperial Majesty, your beloved consort. It was with unfeigned pleasure and rejoicing that we welcomed His Imperial Majesty on the auspicious occasion of your marriage, realizing that between the two peoples of your Majesty's native and adopted lands there existed ties of kinship, cemented by many years of alliance and unbroken peace. It has been a source of increasing gratification to us that the promise held out by the Prince in his early life has been more than fulfilled in mature years. A beloved commander, a brave leader, a generous adversary, a true friend, a trusted ally, one who bore victory nobly and modestly as in his later days he endured suffering heroically, we can but lament that his valued life has, in the providence of God, been brought to so early a termination, and tender our profound sympathy to your Imperial Majesty on the loss of such a consort, and to the German people on the loss of such a Sovereign. Given under the Common Seal of the Vestry this fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight. (Signed) HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk. The Address to the Queen was forwarded through the Home Secretary, who stated that Her Majesty was pleased to receive the same very graciously. The Address to the Empress Frederick was sent to the Marquis of Salisbury, Secretary for Foreign Affairs, with a request that it might be forwarded to the British Ambassador at the German Court, for presentation to Her Imperial Majesty. The Address having been thus presented, a letter was received in due course from the German Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, tendering the sincerest thanks of the EmpressQueen for the Vestry's expression of sympathy. 92 CONCLUDING REMARKS. The Vestry have not attempted in the foregoing Report to touch upon mere routine business requiring attention from day to day, but have endeavoured to submit to their fellow-parishioners, in as clear and succinct a manner aspossible, a statement of the principles which have guided them in the discharge of their trust, and particulars of the present condition of the Parish. By Order, HARRY WILKINS, Vestry Clerk. 93 Supplemental Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER, DURING THE YEAR 1888-9. Vestry Hall, Piccadilly, W. Surveyor's Department.

These dimensions include 11,650 feet of new York stone, and 1,160 feet of new kerb. The footway, paving, and kerbing of Burlington Gardens, New Burlington Street, Walker's Court, and Saville Row (West side), were also taken up and relaid, in addition to the footway paving of those streets in which the carriageways were repaved with a quiet material. OLD MATERIALS. The quantities of old materials sold were:—Wood, 40½ cart loads; York stone, 1,453 square feet; pitching, 1 square yard. Kerb 18 feet run. REFUGES.

Licence has also been given in 37 cases to open the roadway to repair water pipes, or for similar purposes. The cost of making good these openings is charged to the person taking out the Licence. COAL PLATES. During the past twelve months fifty-seven coal plates were cut into the paving. LIGHTING. Ninety-nine lamps of improved construction have been fixed in the following streets, viz.: Air Street, Naylor's Yard, Angel Court, St. Alban's Place, Carlton Street, Haymarket, Rose and Crown Yard, Pickering Place, Mason's Yard (passage), Rupert Street, Heddon Street, Ham Yard, Poland Street, Duck Lane, Edward Street, W ardour Street,.

The refuge lamps are furnished with a "midnight arrangement," and a man is employed by your Vestry to light, extinguish, and clean these lamps and those in the urinals, and also to reduce the light at 12 o'clock at night. SEWERS. The old brick sewer at the upper end of Hill's Place,, which had become very defective, was destroyed, and 9-inch pipes laid in lieu thereof. Repairs were also carried out to the sewer in Hopkin Street, and opposite No. 100, Regent Street. 101 Complaint having been received of the smell from the sewer ventilator at the upper end of Ramilies Street, and consent having been obtained, an iron ventilating pipe was carried from the sewer up the rear of No. 197, Oxford Street, above the roof, and the old ventilator destroyed. Several of the small subsidiary sewers running under the vaults of the houses in Regent Street have been partially blocked. In each case the stoppage was removed, and where found necessary the old barrel drain destroyed and earthenware pipes substituted. The cost of repairing sewers, bricking up old disused drains, new side entrance covers, &c., amounted to the sum of £72 9s. 7d. for the year. GULLIES. Forty-four gullies have been reconstructed at a cost of £147 13s. 2d. They are situate as follows:— Argyll Street (Little) 1 Beak Street 2 Berwick Street 3 Bridle Lane 1 Carnaby Street 5 Charles Street 1 Coventry Street 1 Ganton Street 1 Glasshouse Street 1 Haymarket 1 Jermyn Street 1 John Street (Upper) 3 Marlborough Street (Great) 14 Piccadilly 3 Regent Street 1 Savile Row 1 Shaftesbury Avenue 2 Warwick Street (Lower) 2 44 102 CLEANSING SEWERS AND GULLIES. The cost of labour for cleansing the sewers was £121 10s. 9d., and for emptying 1,502 gullies, £67 2s. The accumulation removed from the sewers and gullies being carted away by the slopping contractor, under his contract, without extra expense. CONNECTIONS TO SEWERS. Thirty-five new connections from houses have been made to the sewers by men in the employ of your Vestry. FLUSHING. The small sewers and courts were flushed at intervals during the hot weather as found necessary. The cost of water was £58 16s. 11d.; labour, £17 5s. 11d.; and hose and hose reel and tools, £59 5s. 6d. DISINFECTING. The gullies and market streets were regularly disinfected during the summer months. The disinfectants used for all purposes amounted to 899 gallons of carbolic acid, and 12 cwt. of carbolic powder, costing £46 3s. URINALS. The saving of water at Broad Street and King's Arms Yard Urinals, by the adoption of the trough system, having proved so satisfactory, your Vestry decided to apply it to the remainder of the Urinals in the Parish. A specification was prepared and prices obtained accordingly, with the result that an order was given to Messrs. B. Finch & Co., of Belvedere Road, Lambeth, who carried out the work. A constant supply of water is laid on to all the urinals in the parish except two. The cost of water was £113 2s. 4d, 103 and alterations, repairs and painting £185 8s. 7d. As stated last year, the repairs are principally making good damage caused by persons unknown. MACHINE BROOMS. The machine brooms required re-filling with new bass on the average once in six weeks. The cost of sundry repairs and re-fillings amounted to the sum of .£73 4s. WATERING. The street watering throughout the year was carried out by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a schedule of prices. The water is supplied by the Grand Junction Water Works Company by contract. STONE YARD. Additional new sheds have been erected in the Stoneyard for housing the following machines and goods, viz.:—Horse Scrapers, Wood Blocks, Hose and Hose Reel, Carbolic Acid, Bricks, and Iron Castings. These articles being now kept more compact, give more room for other things. ORDERLY BOYS. There are now fifteen Orderly Boys at work in the main thoroughfares, under the direction of a Foreman. It is a difficult matter to keep them constantly at their duties, but nevertheless they pick up a large quantity of horse droppings in the course of the day which would otherwise be carried all over the streets. Bins are fixed in the streets for their use at suitable places, to prevent the nuisance which was previously caused by the accumulations by the kerb. 104 DUSTING AND SLOPPING. The contract for dusting was carried out by Mr. Henry Covington, of Battersea Park, at a cost of £2,900, and that for slopping by Mr. William Mead, of Paddington, at a cost of £1,600. I am, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY MONSON, Assoc. M. Inst. C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. 105 St. James, Westminster.

List of Articles obtained for Analysis 171 149 TO THE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS of the VESTRY OF ST. JAMES, WESTMINSTER. Reverend Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following Report upon the Public Health of the Parish of St. James's, Westminster, for the year 1888. The census of 1881 gives the District of the Parish of St. James's as covering an area of 162 acres, and containing a population of 29,865. The Golden Square Sub-District appears as covering an area of 54 acres, and containing a population of 11,585. The Berwick Street Sub-District appears as covering an area of 108 acres, and containing a population of 18,280. Taking these data from the census, the mean density of the population of the whole District appears as 184 per acre, while the density of the population of the Golden Square Sub- 150 District appears as 215 persons per acre, and that of the Berwick Street Sub-District as 169 persons per acre. During the year 1888, the death-rate of London has been 18 5 per 1,000; this is by far the lowest death-rate yet recorded in London. The net mortality for the year 1888 was 386 deaths Taking the population at 29,865, 386 deaths gives a deathrate of 12.96 per 1,000. The mortality from Zymotic diseases during the year has been 26. Of Fever and Diphtheria, 72 cases came under notice during the year; but many cases may not have been known, there being as yet no law requiring that notice of such cases be given to the Sanitary Authority. Of these cases 2 were Diphtheria, 11 were Typhoid Fever, and 59 were Scarlet Fever. 51 cases of Scarlet Fever and 3 of Typhoid were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. 2 cases of Small-pox occurred, both of which were removed to extra-Parochial Hospitals. During the year 1888, 35 bodies were removed into the Mortuary. In several cases bodies were removed from the presence of families generally living in a single room, and where, but for the public Mortuary, the family would have lived and slept in the presence of a decomposing corpse, upon which, possibly, a post-mortem would have had to be made before interment could take place. In 6 cases the bodies have been removed from hotels or lodging-houses. Twentyone inquests have been held upon bodies lying in the Mortuary, and 18 post-mortem examinations for judicial purposes have been made in the Examination Room which adjoins the Mortuary. 151 The following numbers of Deaths were registered as having occurred in St. James's during the year 1888 :— First Quarter 140 Second Quarter 97 Third Quarter 96 Fourth Quarter 94 Gross mortality for year 1888 427 Deduct deaths of Non-Parishioners :— Dying in the Workouse 32 Dying in the Throat Hospital 9 41 Net Mortality for the year 1888 386 For a population of 29,865, 386 deaths is a death-rate of 12.96 per thousand. The net mortality and death-rate of St. James's have been continuously decreasing. These facts, for the last ten years, are shown in the following table, but, until we have a new census, it is difficult to know what changes are taking place in the population of St. James's since the census of 1881:— Gross Mortality.

REPORT UPON ARTICLES ANALYSED DURING THE YEAR 1888, made to the Vestry of St. James, Westminster, by JAS. EDMUNDS, M.D., M.R.C.P., Lond., F.R.M.S., F.C.S., &c., Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst for St. James, Westminster Reverend Sir and Gentlemen,— During the year 1888, under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 55 samples were examined, of which 54 were procured for examination by the Vestry Officers, and one was brought by a parishioner. Of milk, 12 specimens have been examined. Only two of these samples were certified as adulterated. In these cases the milk was found to contain respectively 20 and 21 parts per cent. of added water. The Vendors were summoned, and each was fined 5s. and costs. Two samples of coffee were found to contain 40 parts per cent. of chicory. In the first case the vendor was summoned, and fined £l and costs ; in the second case the vendor was fined 10s. and costs. On comparing these facts with those set out in previous Annual Reports, it will appear that fraud in the shape of adulteration of those articles of food which are in general request among the population in the Parish of St. James has greatly diminished —doubtless in consequence of the prosecutions that have been instituted by the Vestry. The variation in the penalties inflicted by different Magistrates in cases of conviction under the Adulteration Acts is an anomaly. In none of the samples was any poisonous ingredient discovered. No money or consideration other than the stipend paid by the Vestry has been received by me in connection with these analyses. I have the honour to remain, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JAMES EDMUNDS. 8, Grafton Street, Piccadilly. 171 Samples of Food submitted for Examination during the Year 1888. Date 1888. No. Article. Quality. REMARKS.
