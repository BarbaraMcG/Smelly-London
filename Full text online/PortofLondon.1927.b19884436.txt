TO THE WORSHIPFUL THE POET OF LONDON SANITARY COMMITTEE. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1927. One thousand four hundred and eighty-six vessels were examined by the Boarding Staff at Gravesend as coming under suspicion by reason of the ports visited during the voyage, because of declared illness on board or for alien examination. The total number of ''foreign'' arrivals at Gravesend for visiting by the Medical Officers was 14,697. At Sheerness the arrivals were 708. The number of cases of illness reported on by the Medical Officers was 866; of these, 47 cases were removed to Denton Hospital. In this connection, I hope that the number of cases on ships will dwindle as the result of international awakening in the matter of ship sanitation and hygiene, and one can but look back with satisfaction on the two visits of foreign Medical Officers to the Port under the auspices of the League of Nations. No case of Plague or Cholera reached London, but one ship produced plague-infected rats, she having come from a quarter which, though always kept under suspicion, was not known at the time to be infected. The number of fumigations for rat destruction on vessels rose to 136. One hundred and six disinfections for Infectious Disease were undertaken. In food inspection the apples from America were not found in any case to be seriously contaminated with arsenic. I have to note with satisfaction the great progress which has been made in the provision of modern sanitary conveniences in the Docks by the Port of London Authority. One pavilion for infectious disease at Denton Hospital has been replaced with a thoroughly up-to-date building. Owing to the establishment of a Tilbury-Dunkirk daily service, it became necessary to detail one officer to the examination of aliens—a return to conditions which obtained before the War—necessitating an additional Assistant Medical Officer at Gravesend. The Annual Report of the working on the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations is appended. I have to record that during the year, in which the customary close personal supervision of the work of the Authority's officers could not always be given the loyal assistance afforded by the Staff has permitted no decrease in the efficiency of the work done.

(2) Proceeding up the River Medway. In respect of vessels proceeding up the River Thames, the Port Sanitary Authority maintains a hulk moored in the River, off Gravesend, about twenty-six miles below London Bridge, on which a Medical Officer is always on duty, day and night. The Customs Boarding Station is also at Gravesend, and the Port Medical Officer accompanies the Customs Officer, who visits by motor launch all vessels from "foreign." Although no arrangements have been made for notifying the Port Sanitary Authority of the arrival of inward vessels requiring special attention, notice is frequently given to the Authority by shipowners and others. All vessels from foreign ports are visited by a Medical Officer in the Customs launch in Gravesend Reach. The questions are put by the Customs Officer, and the answers made by the masters are heard by the Medical Officer, and all cases of reported sickness during the voyage examined or enquired into. Ships from ports in the Eastern Hemisphere, South of latitude 45° N. (except European ports West of longitude 20° E.), and ships from ports in the Western Hemisphere, South of latitude 30° N., are considered as from "infected ports," and are boarded and examined, whatever the report. Ports, or rather coast-lines containing ports, are added or exempted according to reports of the movement of infection. Medical examination under this system, whether in spite of a negative or because of a positive report of illness, has from time to time led to the detection of serious conditions of infection. Cases of infectious disease on incoming vessels are removed in the Port Sanitary Authority's motor launch to the Authority's hospital for infectious diseases, which is situated on the river bank at Denton, just below Gravesend. In cases where it is deemed advisahle, immediate contacts are also removed from the vessels to hospital for observation. In some cases, e.g., vessels on which Plague or Small-pox has occurred, the names and addresses of all the passengers and crews are taken, and forwarded with the necessary information to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which they are proceeding. The vessels come again under scrutiny by a Sanitary Inspector while in the Port, special attention being given to those on which there has been suspicious circumstances during the voyage. Disinfection of infected quarters is generally carried out by the Authority's Staff before the vessel proceeds up the Eiver, the method employed being by burning sulphur and washing down with "Izal." Infected bedding, clothing, &c., is removed by launch to the Authority's hospital and disinfected by the Washington Lyons apparatus. Vessels proceeding up the Eiver Medway are dealt with by a part-time Medical Officer from Sheerness, whose duty it is to visit within about twelve hours of arrival every vessel from "foreign" remaining within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. Cases of infectious disease on such vessels would be removed by launch to the Port Sanitary Authority's hospital. No special arrangements have been made for cleansing of persons. Three motor launches are available for ambulance transport of cases of infectious disease occurring within the Port. The detection of venereal disease generally results from questioning the masters and surgeons of vessels, or the examination of such members of crews as are mustered for examination at the request of the Medical Officer. Handbills showing where free treatment can be obtained by seamen are distributed on vessels. Bacteriological examinations of rats, &c.., are carried out for the Authority by arrangements with the Seamen's Hospital Society at their Hospital in the Eoyal Albert Dock. 9 TABLE II.—Infectious Disease. disease. 1918. 1919. 1920. 1921. 1922. 1923. 1924. 1925. 1926.

"Morvada" arrived at Gravesend on the 8th June, 1927, having landed a case of Cholera at Madras on 6th May, 1927. The patient was a second-class passenger, who joined the ship at Calcutta. The vessel called at Madras on the 5th May, and the passenger landed. On rejoining the ship the following day he developed symptoms of Cholera, was diagnosed as such by the ship's surgeon, and removed at once to hospital at Madras. Pathological investigation confirmed the diagnosis. Disinfection of bedding and effects was carried out by Madras Health Authorities on shore, and the infected cabin disinfected by the ship's officials, special attention being given to the latrine used by the patient. All immediate contacts were given anti-cholera vaccine. On arrival of the vessel at Colombo all fresh-water tanks were emptied, cleansed and refilled with fresh water. On arrival of the vessel at Gravesend the whole of the native crew were examined. No further case occurred. The ss. "Morea" arrived at Gravesend on the 6th October, 1927, from Shanghai. Daring the voyage a Lascar died suddenly on board from suspected Cholera. The crew's quarters were disinfected, also the patient's personal effects, which were sent back to Bombay. The patient's bedding, &c., were thrown overboard. No further case occurred. The ss. "Adrastus," from Yokohama, arrived at Gravesend on the 10th October, 1927. While the vessel was at Yokohama a Chinese fireman died on board. Samples of the patient's stools were taken, and the diagnosis of Cholera was bacteriologically confirmed. The ship was placed in quarantine for a week. All the crew were taken ashore, bathed and inoculated, and their clothing disinfected. The firemen's quarters and isolation hospital were thoroughly disinfected. No further case occurred. The ss. "Glenapp" arrived at Gravesend on the 16th November, 1927, having landed two cases of Cholera at Kobe on the 31st August. The ship was quarantined at Kobe for 14 days, during which time excreta from all on board was bacteriologically examined and the ship thoroughly disinfected. No further case occurred. The bacteriological examination—a precaution against the danger of "carriers" in the Cholera—is an interesting illustration of Japanese practice in quarantine. The carrier rate in some epidemics is found to be surprisingly high. The ss. "Peisander," from Macassar, arrived at Gravesend on the 24th December, 1927, having on board two distressed British seamen, firemen, from the ss. "British Judge." Both the firemen had been off duty from the 19th to 23rd November, suffering from Diarrhoea, and on arrivel at Suez, on the 27th November, although then feeling quite well, they were taken ashore as suspected cases of Cholera. This action on the part of the Suez Health Authorities was probably due to the fact that the "British Judge" came from Abadam. There was no recurrence of Diarrhoea while in hospital, and the men were returned as distressed British seamen per the ss. " Peisander " on December 9th. No further case occurred. 11 ANTI-CHOLERA INOCULATIONS. In August your Medical Officer received a notification from the Ministry of Health that Shipping Companies might ask for inoculation against Cholera in crews trading with the Persian Gulf. The subject matured, and, between 26th August and 15th September, 137 members of crews of three vessels were immunised by means of vaccine supplied by Messrs. Parke, Davis and Co. Charges for the services rendered, approved by your Worshipful Committee, were paid by the owners of the vessels concerned. PLAGUE. The ss. "Plutarch" arrived in the Port of London on the 26th June, 1927, with a grain cargo. The voyage of the vessel was as follows :— Glasgow—12th March, 1927. Liverpool—13th to 19th March. Bahia (Brazil)—7th to 8th April—discharging cargo. Eio de Janeiro—11th to 22nd April—discharging cargo. Santos—23rd to 29th April—discharging. Eio Grande—2nd to 5th May—completed discharging. Eio Grande to Buenos Aires—in ballast—7th May. Eosario—8th to 17th May—loading cargo. Buenos Aires—18th to 28th May—loading cargo. (At Buenos Aires—18th-22nd—lay alongside ss. " Lassell "). Las Palmas—17th to 18th June—bunkering. Arrived Gravesend 26th June. The cargo was first worked on the afternoon of the 28th June, and on the morning of the 29th June an Inspector of this Authority ascertained and reported mortality amongst the rats, in one of which, submitted to the Seamen's Hospital, Connaught Eoad, a gram negative bi-polar bacillus morphologically indistinguishable from bacillus pestis was demonstrated to me. A guinea-pig inoculated on this day subsequently died of Plague, thus confirming the cause of the mortality. Two further rats, recently dead, when sent to the Ministry of Health, showed the same cause of death. No case of illness had occurred among the crew. Thirty rats were reported to have been trapped at sea, and in the search for rat mortality 35 rats were found dead. Customary precautions were immediately observed. The engines had by this time been opened out and the crew reduced. It seemed to be expedient that the ship should be unloaded as quickly as possible, with all precautions against the transference of rats from the ship, more especially as it was possible to moor the vessel off in the centre of the dock bay, the two head mooring ropes and a ladder over the bow forming the only connection with the shore or other craft during non-working hours. It was further satisfactory that the sheds about this dock bay contained no material attractive to rats. Lighters and barges were examined before coming alongside the ship to ascertain their state as regards rats, and fumigation was carried out where evidence of rats in these was found. In the discharge of bagged grain every bag put overboard was surveyed with a view to the possibility of the presence of a rat therein. In dealing with the bulk grain by means of elevators, bagging of the grain on discharge was not permitted; the fall of the grain into the barges could thus be watched against the transference of a rat, dead or alive. On deciding to discharge the ship in dock it became possible to pay off the crew. A temporary cessation of work on the ship, together with the facts that the upper 'tween decks had been largely emptied of cargo and that the lower holds,, save in the hatchways, where bagged cargo was placed, were filled with bulk grain, suggested the possible large efficacy of a preliminary fumigation of the holds before discharge. This tended to greater safety, and on various counts your Medical Officer decided that the liquid hydrocyanic acid method would be the best possible for this preliminary fumigation. Your Medical Officer had the great advantage of consultation with the 12 Medical Officers of the Ministry of Health in the pros ana cons of the matter of preliminary fumigation and subsequent precautions against the change from the danger of the living poison of the plague bacillus to that of hydrocyanic acid fumes. This preliminary fumigation would appear to have been nearly successful in exterminating the particular vermin concerned in Plague spread on board, both fleas and rats. In connection with the fleas, it is to be noted that they are more susceptible to the poison than rats, being killed in a shorter time and with a lesser lethal concentration of hydrocyanic acid in the atmosphere. Between the Friday fumigation and the starting of work on Monday there was an ample airing of the ship, but Mr. Wilton, of the Fumigation Services, Ltd., whose expert handling of the fumigant has been of the greatest use to this Authority, carried out such stringent tests continuously during two days of working of the cargo as showed that safety had been assured. At the second and complete fumigation, when the vessel was discharged, only five rats were found. The history of the total rat population of this ship is shown in the appended list below. The cargo of the ship consisted of pollards, flour, wheat, linseed, maize and semetin in bags and wheat and maize in bulk. The number of dead rats found immediately before the preliminary fumigation, death being attributable to Plague, was 35, this constituting the definite evidence of mortality.

Total 291 Carried forward 250 13th July. Second Fumigation. 2 in bunkers. 3 in after-hold. Total 5 The special points to which I would draw attention are the value of examining ships on commencement of discharge of cargo as to rat mortality—a routine in the Port—the value of a preliminary fumigation as a safety measure for workers and prevention of spread of infection in the Port, and the suitability of hydrocyanic acid for preliminary fumigation in selected cases. This ship and her circumstances constituted a favourable case for preliminary fumigation and successful results therefrom. Some suspicion fell on three grain ships arriving subsequently from the South American coast, and special precautions were taken, including a preliminary disinfestation on two of these; the suspicion was not confirmed.

The ss. "Warwickshire" arrived at Gravesend from Rangoon on the 1st January, 1927, having landed two of the native crew at Colombo, on December 8th, 1926, suffering from suspected mild Small-pox. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by telegram. Full disinfection was carried out by the Port Authorities at Colombo. No further case occurred. The ss. "City of Venice" arrived at Gravesend from Calcutta on the 3rd January, 1927, having landed a case of Small-pox and two contacts (all natives) at Aden on the 17th December, 1926. The whole of the passengers and crew were vaccinated and disinfection carried out. No further case occurred. The ss. "City of Benares" arrived at Gravesend from Calcutta on the 9 th January, 1927, with Small-pox on board :— Case 1. A Lascar who joined at Calcutta on the 7th December, 1926, was taken ill on the 14th December. Temperature normal, spots on face and wrist. No other symptoms. 15th December: Temperature 101.4, spots more pronounced on face, limbs and body. 19th December to 23rd December: General pustular rash. The patient was found dead at 7 a.m. on the 24th December, and was buried at sea the same day. There was no evidence as to vaccination. The case was infected at Calcutta. On arrival of the vessel at Suez, on the 26th December, all the crew were re-vaccinated with the exception of Case 2: A fireman, who was missed and appears to have evaded the operation. This case, not an immediate contact of Case 1, was first taken ill on the 8th January, 1927, and isolated at once. On arrival at Gravesend the case was seen by the Boarding Medical Officer, who reported: "Patient looks ill, has profuse papular shotty rash on face and ears, also present on arms and limbs, particularly wrists. Eash just coming out on trunk and limbs. No vaccination marks to be seen." The case was removed to the hospital of this Authority at Denton. Infected from Case 1. The following precautions were taken:— The starboard cabin forward was disinfected by wash and sulphur fumigation and all contents removed to Denton Hospital with the patient. Five beds adjoining the bunk in the forecastle were also removed, and general fumigation of the forecastle was carried out. The native crew (71) remained on board, and the European crew's addresses were notified to the Medical Officers of Health concerned as they left the ship. It is a striking fact, but no longer a matter of wonder, that the disease should have sought out the one member amongst the native crew, who, whether by evasion or oversight, escaped the preventive measure of re-vaccination. Every other member of the crew was vaccinated on the leg as a precautionary measure, and presented the scars either of success or failure of this vaccination. The successful proved the efficacy of the lymph used. The unsuccessful vaccinations show the large degree of immunity to Small-pox which the persons unaffected by re-vaccination already possessed. Since the patient in Denton Hospital was not in particular association with the original infecting case who died during the voyage, one again notes the powerful selective infectiousness of Small-pox for the unvaccinated. The ss. "Clan Macnair" arrived at Gravesend on the 10th January, 1927, having landed a case of Small-pox at Colombo on the 10th December, 1926. Disinfection was carried out by the Port Authorities there. No further case occurred. 14 The ss. "Mangalore" arrived at Gravesend on the 12th February, 1927, from Calcutta, having landed a case of Small-pox (Lascar) at Port Sudan on the 25th January. All bedding and infected articles had been burned, and the patient's personal effects landed with him. The crew's quarters were washed down with a carbolic solution. No further case occurred. The ss. "Oxfordshire" arrived at Gravesend on the 26th February, 1927, from Rangoon, having landed the Eighth Engineer at Suez, suffering from modified Small-pox. All passengers and crew were reported to have been vaccinated, and the necessary disinfection of quarters, bedding, &c., carried out. No further case occurred. The ss. "Nankin" arrived at Gravesend, from Calcutta, on the 3rd March, 1927. On the 4th March a coal trimmer and three others of the native crew were taken ill and diagnosed as Influenza. All the cases were isolated aft. Three of the cases recovered and two returned to duty. The third was detailed to nurse the coal trimmer, who was still unwell, having fever, backache, headache and general malaise. On the 6th March he was found to have a rash on the face and body, and was thought, on the 7th March, when the rash had further developed, to be suffering from Small-pox. In Tilbury Dock, on the 7th March, the case was diagnosed as Small-pox, and the patient, together with one contact and effects were removed to Denton Hospital. Two faint vaccination marks were observed on the patient's right arm. The whole of the native crew were mustered and examined, but no trace of recent Small-pox was found. General vaccination was carried out. The isolation cabin was disinfected in dock, and the forecastles disinfected on the way round to Dundee, for which port the vessel left on the afternoon of the 7th March, the Medical Officer for Dundee being notified of the facts. The names and addresses of the passengers who arrived by the ship, together with the names and addresses of the European crew who left the ship, were notified to the Medical Officers concerned. The ship was at Port Said on the 18th February. The rash was found on the 6th March. Probable place of infection was Port Said. The ss. "Rawalpindi" arrived at Gravesend at 9 a.m. on the 17th March, 1927, from Bombay, having landed a fatal case of Small-pox at Gibraltar on the 13th March. Infection took place at Calcutta. The case was isolated on the 4th March, thus on arrival the incubation period for contacts was practically completed. On careful examination, no one of the passengers or crew was found to be ill. The closest attention was paid to recent vaccination of the passengers; it was found that practically all had been vaccinated or re-vaccinated in connection with the case or had been previously re-vaccinated. This measure had rendered spread almost impossible. The whole of the passengers, numbering 273. were forthwith notified to the Medical Officers of their places of destination. The same measure was taken with regard to each member of the crew, if on leave. The infected quarters were re-disinfected and all infected bedding removed to Denton Hospital for steam disinfection. The ss. "Yorkshire" arrived at Gravesend on the 27th March, 1927, from Rangoon. On the 28th February a deck passenger was removed to hospital at Colombo, where the Bill of Health was endorsed "Modified Convalescent Small-pox." The patient's personal effects were fumigated ashore, and all contacts and passengers vaccinated on board. No further case occurred. The ss. "Leicestershire," from Rangoon, arrived at Gravesend on the 16th April, 1927, having landed a native suffering from mild Small-pox at Rangoon. All disinfection was carried out at that port and the crew re-vaccinated. No further case occurred. The ss. "Ranpura" arrived at Gravesend, from Bombay, on the 19th August, 1927, having landed a case of Small-pox at Bombay on the 30th July. The infected cabin was fumigated at Aden and the bedding disinfected on board. One mattress was taken to Denton Hospital on arrival of the vessel for disinfection. No further case occurred. 15 The ss. "Wangaratta" arrived at Gravesend on the 1st September, 1927, from Brisbane, having landed a case of Small-pox at Suez on the 13th August. All disinfection was carried out at Suez, and the personal effects of the patient were taken with him to hospital. The whole of the crew were vaccinated. The vessel was examined by the Hull Port Sanitary Authorities, at which port she called before proceeding to London. No further case occurred. On the 21st October, 1927, I received a note from South Shields saying that a man from the ss. "Backworth," messroom boy, age 21, exhibited scars of what appeared to be old Small-pox of a month's duration. The vessel was then lying at Silvertown, and I ascertained that the ship was at South Shields on the 7th September, 1927, arrived Naples 20th September, left Naples 24th September, arrived Sfax 27th September, left Sfax 29th September, called at Oran for bunkers 4th October, and arrived at London on the 11th October. The boy was berthed with the cook on the ship, who stated to the Inspector that the boy was violently sea-sick soon after leaving South Shields, and at Naples presented a rash. It further appeared that the Captain had not seen this rash until after leaving Oran, when he thought the boy's blood was out of order and did some treatment. From the information received from Dr. Campbell Lyons, of South Shields, the boy had visited the Royal Albert Dock Hospital on the 14th October. I ascertained that a blood specimen was taken and the patient did not return, but the Wassermann reaction was found negative on the 19th October. The master of the ship corrected the place of rash as given by the cook to Oran, but I think the circumstances of the visit to the Seamen's Hospital, together with the cook's positive statement that the rash was noticed at Naples, signified that the master was not fully conversant with the case throughout. I think the cook, the patient's cabin mate, was more likely to know the circumstances. On the arrival of the vessel at Gravesend the questions put, and the answers given, were heard by the Boarding Medical Officer. These showed that the ship had had no sickness during the voyage. The Captain, by a letter—and he was genuine in the matter—showed that he in no way realised the seriousness of his answer at Gravesend. The cabin was fumigated and washed down. On the whole, I think it was a case of Small-pox, and that the infection took place in the North of England. The ship was notified on to Swansea, and the crew who had left the ship in London—eleven in number—were notified as going to such addresses as could be obtained from the log. TABLE VI.—Scarlet Fever.

It is not easy to satisfactorily group the morbid states found and reported on incoming ships. Exigencies of time and tide frequently necessitate a concentration on infectious diseases only, so that these may be excluded even if a close diagnosis is not arrived at, while many a diagnosis has to be made from reports of symptoms. I have therefore listed the diagnoses furnished without too close a grouping. INFECTIOUS DISEASE—DIAGNOSIS. Two cases of rather extraordinary interest were admitted to Denton Hospital for watching. One of the cases presented a rash which suggested several of the infectious fevers in succession, but on watching, and on obtaining the history, eventually presented a state of severe purpura due to an intensive course of treatment for syphilis, in a foreign port. The second case, admitted as Enteric Fever (?), of onset November 9th, 1927, on the 22nd November coughed up a preserved pea, which he remembers to have swallowed on the 7th November, stating that it had "stuck in his neck." From the symptoms the pea had been impacted in the right bronchus, and this fortunate loosing and coughing up saved the man from an exacerbation of all the conditions which had developed in his lung, probably followed by death; no diagnosis of the causative condition could have been made in the absence of the history of swallowing a pea " the wrong way "; bronchoscopy would not have suggested itself. These two cases are illustrative of the difficulties of rapid diagnosis which confront your Medical Officers on duty on the arrival of ships from "foreign," though in themselves happily extreme rarities. TRAINING SFIIPS. On the whole, the health of the boys on the Training Ships in the River has been good, but few cases of infectious disease having occurred during the year. 31 The following cases of Infectious Disease were reported during the year:— TABLE XXVII.

SCHICK TEST AND IMMUNISATION AGAINST DIPHTHERIA. In the year 1922 it was considered, with regard to one of the Training Ships in the River Thames, that the Schick test for Diphtheria and the immunisation of those boys who were found to be susceptible to this disease would be a boon to the whole personnel and to the lads who would join the vessel. In consequence, Diphtheria is now virtually unknown on that ship. Recently your Worshipful Committee has made arrangements for the reception and treatment of cases of Infectious Disease from the Training Ship "Cornwall" at Denton Hospital. With regard to Diphtheria, it is obvious that, with so perfected a method of prevention as Schick testing and immunisation, other measures fall into quite a secondary place. I therefore suggested to the Superintendent of the T.S. "Cornwall" that the Schick test should be applied to the boys on his ship and immunisation should follow in the estimated 40 per cent. of boys who would be found to be susceptible. With regard to costings, it appeared to your Medical Officer that a work of such definite preventive value might well be undertaken by the Port of London Sanitary Authority at a minimum cost, namely, that of the price of the material used. The offer has been made to the Managers of the T.S. "Cornwall" and accepted, subject to the necessary consent being given by the boys' parents, in which case the boys on the ship will be rendered entirely immune to the disease, Diphtheria, which from time to time causes anxiety from its recrudescences in severe or in epidemic form. INFECTIOUS DISEASE OCCURRING ON CERTAIN CLASSES OF H.M. VESSELS. The following letter was received from the Ministry of Health:— Sib, I am directed by the Minister of Health to state, for the information of the Port Sanitary Authority, that he has been in communication with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty with reference to the question of the control of cases of infectious disease occurring in certain classes of H.M. vessels, and he is informed that the Lords Commissioners consider it desirable that Officers of Port Sanitary Authorities should visit and deal with all vessels belonging to or chartered to the Admiralty (with the exception of His Majesty's ships in commission) in all respects as if they were ordinary ships. It is not proposed-that the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authorities should extend to the Naval Dockyards themselves, the sanitary control of which would remain the responsibility of the Naval Authorities. I am accordingly to request that the Minister may be informed whether the Port Sanitary Authority is prepared to undertake the responsibilities proposed. If so, I am to suggest that the Authority should apply to the Admiralty for the necessary consent under Section 327 of the Public Health Act, 1875. I am, Sib, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) F. F. MARCHBANKS. 32 Your Medical Officer presumes that the sanitary control foreshadowed in this letter applies to transport ships chartered to the Admiralty but not flying the white ensign. During the War there were numbers of these and other ships even carrying Naval ratings, and they were dealt with by the Port Sanitary Authority as ordinary merchant vessels. The position was one of some doubt, which doubt occas:onally found expression on boarding the ships. Irregularities further occurred in that Naval ratings suffering from infectious disease were actually taken from these vessels to Denton Hospital and dealt with there, e.g., Bubonic Plague, ex ss. "Hector." Section 327 of the Public Health Act, 1875, safeguards the Crown privileges, and any interference with such must be in every case with the consent of " such Lord High Admiral or Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral, Secretary of State, Commissioners, body of persons or person as are hereinbefore in that behalf respectively mentioned, such consent to be expressed in writing in the case of a corporation under their common seal, and in the case of any body of persons not being a corporation under the hand of their clerk or other duly authorised officer or agent." Your Medical Officer recommended that the position should be regularised in accordance with the request of the Ministry of Health by informing the Minister that the Port Sanitary Authority is prepared to undertake the responsibilities proposed, and, in accordance with the Resolution of your Worshipful Committee dated 1st February, the following correspondence ensued:— 8th February, 1927. The Secretary, Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W.I. Sir, I am directed by the Committee of the Port of London Sanitary Authority to reply to your letter IIIc. 1504/4901, of the 18th January. The Port of London Sanitary Authority is prepared to assume the control of cases of Infectious Disease occurring on certain classes of His Majesty's vessels, namely, all vessels belonging to or chartered to the Admiralty, with the exception of His Majesty's vessels in commission. Application is being made to the Admiralty for their consent under Section 327 of the Public Health Act, 1875. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. 8th February, 1927. The Permanent Secretary, Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, Admiralty, Whitehall, S.W.I. Sir, I am directed by the Committee of the Port of London Sanitary Authority to apply under Section 327 of the Public Health Act, 1875, for the consent of the Admiralty to the control of cases of Infectious Disease occurring in vessels belonging to or chartered to the Admiralty, with the exception of His Majesty's vessels in commission, in all respects as if they were ordinary merchant ships. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. Any further communication should be addressed to— The Secretary of the Admiralty, Admiralty, S.W. 1, London, S.W. 1, 16th February, 1927. quoting " M.490/27." Sir, With reference to your letter of the 8th instant, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to convey herewith Their Lordships' consent to the proposed arrangement whereby officers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority shall, within their jurisdiction, visit and deal with all cases of infectious disease occurring in vessels belonging to the Admiralty, or chartered to the Admiralty (with the exception of H.M. ships in commission), in all respects as if they were ordinary merchant vessels. I am, Sir, The Medical Officer of Health, Your obedient Servant, Port of London Sanitary Authority, CHARLES WALKER. 5, Church Passage, Guildhall, E.C. 2. H/C. 33 20th February, 1927. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Admiralty, S.W.I. Sir, I am in receipt of your letter M.490/27 of the 16th instant, conveying the consent of The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to the " proposed arrangement whereby officers of the Port of London Sanitary Authority shall, within their jurisdiction, visit and deal with all cases of infectious disease occurring in vessels belonging to the Admiralty, or chartered to the Admiralty (with the exception of H.M. ships in commission), in all respects as if they were ordinary merchant vessels." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. Enclos. 20th February, 1927. The Secretary, Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W. 1. Sir, With further reference to your letter IIIc. 1504/4901 of the 18th January, I enclose you a copy of a letter received from the Secretary of the Admiralty, consenting to the control by the Port of London Sanitary Authority of "all cases of infectious disease occurring in vessels belonging to the Admiralty or chartered to the Admiralty (with the exception of H.M. ships in commission), in all respects as if they were ordinary merchant vessels." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health, Port of London. TABLE XXVIII.—Disinfecting Operations for Infectious Disease. Date. Fumigated. Name of Vessel.

Inasmuch as the Port of London from West to East extends for a distance of nearly 69 miles and passes through the following Counties -:— On the North Bank, Middlesex, London and Essex, On the South Bank, Suirey, London and Kent, it necessarily follows that there are various sources of water supply. The warehouses and offices in the docks, all of which are within the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, are practically all supplied direct from mains. Shipping in the docks is chiefly supplied with water direct from mains on shore. In some cases, however, for instance where vessels are not lying near a dock quay, water is supplied from water barges which have obtained their supplies from water mains on the dock premises. Vessels lying in the River obtain their supplies direct from water mains on shore or from water barges. The number of water barges in use in the Port of London during the year was 19; two of these were withdrawn temporarily, leaving 17 in use at the end of the year. The barges were inspected periodically and found to be in good sanitary condition. 37 TABLE XXXI.—Return op Rats Caught and Destroyed during 1927.

BATS AND RAT DESTRUCTION. For Reports on cases of Cholera and Small-pox and Plague-infected rats see Tables IV., V. and XXXII. respectively. Measures against Rodents. (1) Steps taken for detection of rodent Plague :— (a) In ships in the Port. It is the duty of Inspectors to make a close examination on the discharge of a cargo on ships arriving from a foreign port as to the presence of any mortality among the rats on a ship; such mortality, if present, would be found either on the opening of hatches or even quite late on the discharge of cargo. (b) On quays, wharves, warehouses, &c., in the vicinity of the Port. A similar strict watch for mortality is kept on the quays and warehouses of the docks. The number of rats during this year were sent to the Seamen's Hospital, Royal Albert Dock, London, in continuity from the time when this Institution was closely connected with the London School of Tropical Medicine, as indeed it is also at present, where an examination of spleen smears is a routine practice in the absence of mortality. With a mortality closer examination is directed. A detection of mortality in the Port, except on incoming ships, has not been found for some years. Wharves and warehouses on the riverside, apart from docks, are not in the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority. (2) Measures taken to prevent the passage of rats between ships and shore :— The booming-off of the ship from the shore, rat guards, tarred frapping of ropes, rat-proof gangway doors and the whitening and illumination of the gangways are the measures used to prevent the passage of rats between ship and shore. (3) Methods of deratisation of :— (a) Ships. Methods of deratisation on ships are: Sulphur, burned, 3 lbs. per 1,000 cubic feet of space; lowest limit of time, six hours. Hydrocyanic acid, by liquid method; by "Zyklon 'B'" method; and recently by a method of "Sanos" gas (Hydrocyanic acid); 0.2 per cent, atmosphere; lowest limit of exposure, two hours. (b) Premises in the vicinity of docks or quays. Rat catchers, poisons, traps, cats and a constant watch as to where these are most necessary. (4) Measures taken for the detection of rat prevalence in ships and on shore :— Examination by Inspectors. 44 (5) Rat-proofing :— (a) To what extent are clocks, wharves, warehouses, &c., rat-proof? A very steady rat-proofing of the docks and warehouses is in progress; the reduction of the normal rat population over 25 years is estimated in one dock at no less than by 80 per cent., and in another dock bv 66 per cent. (b) Action taken to extend rat-proofing :— (i.) In ships— The chief Shipping Companies using the Port of London have been circulated as to the benefits and nature of rat-proofing of ships. (ii.) The Port of London Authority, whose area as regards the docks is largely coincident with that of the Port Sanitary Authority, is active as to (1) (b), (3) (b) and (5) (b) (ii.). In Report No. 82, I noted the elucidation of the infectious disease—Dengue. The vector of this disease has been proved to be a mosquito (Stegomyica fasciata); the same mosquito conveys yellow fever, and the limitation of these two diseases Northward and Southward is the degree of cold outside the tropics at which this mosquito could no further survive, i.e., at about latitude 35°; England, therefore, is free from these infections. I have now to record a similar, if somewhat modified, set of observations in the spread of rat-borne bubonic plague. If these are less defined, they are more interesting from the fact that this want of definition is associated with the double nature of the vector of plague; the primary vector— the rat, bearing a further and communicating vector— the flea, but far more because London has in the past been visited by epidemic and endemic plague, whereas it appears that London may be now less infectible. In India extended observations and close experiment, with deductions therefrom, show that there are areas free from endemic plague, surrounded by or neighbouring to endemic plague areas, that the free areas are often invaded by plague, but the disease gets no lasting hold, and that as between plague incidences in these areas the constant and deciding factor of differentiation is a difference of flea on the respective rat populations. The Indian Rat Flea (Xenopsilla cheopis) in India, in Ceylon and in America, has been recognised as the flea most concerned with the carriage and spread of rat plague and its human sequela. Other fleas, e.g., the European Rat Flea (Ceratophyllus fasciains) and even the human flea (Pulex irritans) to a limited extent may spread the disease when once it gets a foothold in a country, but it appears that they do not initiate or perpetuate epidemics of plague. In England small rat plague infections die out. Certain ports over the world, though bombarded by plague, are beginning to be recognised as non-infectible. As this fact becomes apparent the reason is persistently queried and sought, but naturally without plague in England, comparative observation on plague cannot be made or the answer found here. Hence the value of research into the Indian conditions mentioned above, and of comparative observations made in ports on the North American coast line, of which the following is a mere sketch, but sufficient to the present purpose. The Indian Rat Flea (X. cheopis) is found on rats in increasing numbers in the ports the further towards the Equator these are situated. At a Northern hemisphere port plague gets no hold; to the South is a port where it gets a precarious hold only to disappear; further South is a place where plague rats are found and from time to time a human case of plague; further South again rat plague appears and spreads, with consequent human plague, possibly in epidemic form. Coincident with these varying plague conditions is the increasing cheopis flea index, i.e., numbers of this flea found on the rat. It is now tentatively suggested that the critical cheopis flea index, or that number of this flea per rat which can sustain plague in a rat community, lies at or about 1. For instance, with cheopis index .2 or .6 there is not likely to be sustained rat-borne plague in a place when this is introduced; with index 2 there is sustained rat plague, while index 6 may be coincident with epidemic plague. A deciding factor in the index for coast lines bordering the oceans appears to be meteorological, and the latitude of critical index is at or about 40° on either side of the Equator. 45 Conditions in the Mediterranean and Black Sea; coasts determine these to be endemic plague areas, though partially or wholly outside the 40° parallel; moreover, London, and England, in general, from time to time in history have been swept by epidemics of plague or constituted endemic plague regions. There are, therefore, other factors than the meteorological in determining infectibility; these are suggested for the past as dirt, and in general that stage of civilisation which is tolerant of the rat and breeds out his fleas to excess, from which England, not unaided by " weather," has possibly emerged on to the fractional and more or less safe side of the critical cheopis index. Moreover, the rat is not always and everywhere the rodent concerned in plague spread. The theory, however well advanced, is not absolute knowledge, and will need further research. An extended series of observations on rat fleas is necessary in ports and places. Unlike the specific mosquito vector of dengue and yellow fever, which leads a free life, the X. cheopis is more or less attached to a travelling, warm-blooded animal, and thus is travelled outside the limits of one of the meteorological conditions of its life and reproduction—temperature. A seasonal flea prevalence is a complication which might render a place alternately infectible and non-infectible, according to the rise and fall to above or below the critical cheopis index. Further, a zone such as the waterside of a port, receiving constant small additions of X. cheopis, will possibly have a higher index, and thus a greater infectibility than its perizonal region, Information as to the cheopis index and its variations is needed from every port, first as a contribution to the pool of world knowledge,, and then as probably essential to well-directed plague preventive measures on ships in their voyage to or from ports of higher or lower infectibility. Practical measures which are those directed against the rat, would remain unchanged, unless in the direction of stringency; the higher the numbers of rats the more ready is the spread of plague and the greater the infectibility of the place harbouring them. But the subject of plague has yielded its inner secrets to research so far that there is a distinct value in determining through the cheopis index the status of the Port of London in the scale of plague infectibility through the rat. The index of the Port being known, that for some surrounding area should be determined. The list of observers is long, and records of their observations over many years, on which this report is based, are a large study. Practically the determination of the index might be initiated with the recovery and examination of the fleas of about 80 rats per month. A microscopic examination of each rat for plague should be concurrent with the flea examination, and these should be supervised by an expert bacteriologist and entomologist respectively. A scheme for this work and as to the probable expenditure which would be incurred should include provision for a systematic rat and rat destruction survey in the Port. TABLE XXXV. FORM A.

The certificate given by the Medical Officer or Assistant Medical Officer of Health of the Port shall be marked by the supplier with the date of the supply and shall be retained by him and kept available for inspection." FOOD INSPECTION. Action under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1925, resulted in 1,813 tons 14 cwts. 2 qrs. 4 lbs. of unsound food being destroyed or disposed of in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption. Exceptions are shown in the disposal of some of the goods for distillation, refining and by exportation.

Beef seized and destroyed, 3,713 quarters, crops, &c., 22 bags, 311 tons, 12 cwts., 0 qrs., 12 lbs. (including 303 tons 10 cwts., 3 qrs., 5 lbs. sent to outside contractors). 49 Beep.— A vessel arrived from the River Plate in March. The meat in No. 2 lower hold, consisting of about 300 tons of Beef, had been damaged by dock and river water, owing to flooding of the hold. Notice of detention was served. By arrangement this meat was released to various firms of licensed fat boilers under suitable guarantees. Chilled Beef from Australia.— About 298 quarters of chilled Beef arrived from Australia in February. The discharge was watched by an officer of this Authority. On the whole, a great improvement in condition was noticed as compared with previous shipments. Mutton and Lamb seized and destroyed, 15,791 carcases, 263 tons, 4 cwts. 1 qr., 13 lbs. (including 253 tons, 4 cwts., 1 qr., 7 lbs. sent to outside contractors). Mutton.— A vessel arrived from New Zealand on the 5th November. Water had found its way to No. 2 lower hold containing Mutton. Notice of detention was served in the case of about 18,170 carcases. The Salvage Association had the matter in hand, and the badly damaged Mutton was loaded direct into barses and released to a firm of fat boilers under guarantee. Part of the meat, about 10.000 carcases, was sent to dock store to be reconditioned. The condemned portions of these carcases will be released to the same firm of fat boilers as the reconditioning is completed. Pork.— A careful examination was made of a percentage of pig carcases landed in the district, the number of carcases examined being 4,991. No pig carcase was condemned on account of disease. Attention was drawn to the condition of pigs arriving from South Africa. In some cases the glands were missing, and the carcases were dirty. Pork seized and destroyed, 44 carcases and parts ex 896, 3 tons, 2 cwts. 1 qr., 8 lbs. (including 2 tons, 10 cwts., 3 qrs., 20 lbs. sent to outside contractors). Actinomycosis in Ox Tongues.— A percentage examination was made of every consignment of Ox Tongues arriving in the district. About 308 consignments were put into dock store, where a careful examination of some 60,659 tongues was made by vour officers; 254 tongues were found to be affected with Actinomycosis. A general improvement was noticed; in three cases only was the disease found to exceed 2 per cent. A consignment of Ox Tongues from South Africa was found to be very dirty, the tongues also being in a state of decomposition. No tongue roots arrived in the district during the year. Veal seized and destroyed, 9 bags and parts ex 20 carcases, 7 cwts. 1 qr. Veal from New Zealand.— The importation of boned frozen Veal from New Zealand was the subject of correspondence and discussion in connection with an enquiry from the New7 Zealand Government Office. The method of packing the carcases was not satisfactory in some of the nine consignments which arrived between September and December. The meat was, however, found to be of a good colour and acceptable. Part of one consignment was examined at Smithfield in September, when a Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health was present. In later consignments the method of packing improved. The attachment of a special Government Veterinary Certificate to each package is under consideration for future shipments. 50 Offal seized and destroyed:- Tons. cwts. qrs. lbs.

PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED FOOD) REGULATIONS, 1925. During the year intimations were received from the Ministry of Health that Official Certificate of the following countries had been recognised for the purpose of the above Regulations :— For Items (a) and (c) of the Second Schedule Argentine Republic (amended Certificate). For Item (b) of the Second Schedule :— Uruguay. NEW LEGISLATION. Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1926. 27. The Act repeals the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906. 30. The Sanitary Authority of the Port of London for their district, and the Common Council of the City of London for the City, shall exclusively perform and exercise the duties and powers imposed and conferred in general by the Act on the Councils of counties and county boroughs. Expenses shall be defrayed out of th?. General Rate of the City of London. Civil Liabilities. 1. The seller of either fertiliser or cattle and poultry food named in the 1st and 2nd Schedules must give a '' statutory statement'' in writing showing the purchaser— (a) the name of the article; (b) scheduled particulars; (c) the name of any 3rd Schedule ingredient contained. (Examples, from 1st Schedule : Part I. (a) guano, (b) amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash respectively; Part II. (a) Dried sugar beet residue, (b) amounts of sugar and fibre respectively.) 61 From 2nd Schedule : Part I. (a) Blood dried for fertilising purposes, (?>) amount of nitrogen; Part II. (a) clover meal, (b) amount of fibre. From 3rd Schedule : Ingredients in feeding stuffs, the presence of which must be declared—husks, glumes, shudes, &c., when artificially admixed, rye straw, peat moss, sawdust, &c. Proviso : The obligation does not apply to (1) two or more articles mixed before sale at the request of the purchaser; (2) sales of less than half cwt. if from a conspicuously labelled parcel. 2. (1) The "statutory statement" is a "warranty" of the correctness of the statement. (2) Sale of the articles in Schedules 1 and 2 as cattle or poultry food implies a warranty that the article is suitable for such purpose and does not contain any articles of Schedule 3 except as given in the " statutory statement." (3) Description in a "statutory statement" of a fertiliser or food by the name given in the 1st or 2nd Schedules is a warranty that the effective content scheduled against that name is present in the article. (4) Written statements (other than the "statutory statement") as to ingredients or fineness of grinding have effect as a warranty by the seller that the facts stated are correct. (5) There are more or less normal limits of variation in the ingredients of fertilisers and feeds; therefore no action on such a warranty shall lie where the mis-statement does not exceed the limits of variation prescribed. 3. (1) The purchaser of articles in the 1st and 2nd Schedules or those not included, but for which an implied or expressed warranty has been given, shall be entitled to the services of the official sampler and agricultural analyst on payment of a fee. The purchaser, on demand, shall furnish the official sampler with the statutory statement or warranty. (2) The sampling must be done before the expiry of 14 days from delivery to the purchaser or receipt by the purchaser of the statutory statement or warranty. Criminal Liabilities. 4. (1) First Schedule articles prepared for sale or consignment or exposed for sale must, as to every parcel, be marked in the prescribed manner indicating the particulars to be contained in the statutory statement. (2) A person dealing in such marked parcels may keep a register of marks and what those marks indicate. A mark which is thus entered in a register implies the facts registered in connection with the mark. (a) on the sale of a parcel so marked the mark shall be added to the statutory statement. Offences under 4, are— (1) The absence of the required marks on a parcel. (2) Falsity to the prejudice of the purchaser of the particulars indicated by the mark, as found on analysis. The person selling, having in possession or disposition for purposes of sale or consignment or exposing for sale the parcel shall be guilty of an offence. 5. (1) In consignment direct from ship or quay to purchaser, instead of as in Section 4. (2) The seller of 1st Schedule articles shall enter in his register— (a) date of delivery or consignment to purchaser, place and quantity of delivery; (b) shipping or other mark on the article; (c) particulars required for statutory statement. (3) Offences on part of seller— (a) failure to enter in register the required particulars; (b) any entered particular being materially false; (c) falsity in the statutory statement (found on analysis) or the absence from the register of any particular required for the statutory statement. 6. An offence is committed by owner or seller where fertiliser or feed is sold in small quantities from a labelled parcel and analysis shows that the label is false or does not include the particulars of the " statutory statement." 62 7. It is an offence to sell, offer or expose for sale a feed containing a deleterious ingredient or to have such feed in possession packed and prepared for sale unless— (a) reasonable care would not have disclosed to the seller the presence of a deleterious ingredient; (b) the seller plead warranty or statutory statement and give all information as to the origin of the deleterious mixture; (c) any substance in the 5th Schedule or such excess as there indicated shall be deemed a deleterious ingredient. (Examples from 5th Schedule : Sand, silicious matter, or other insoluble mineral matter not naturally associated with the feed or in greater proportion than natural association; poisonous substances; deleterious salts.) 8. (1) Failure to give "Statutory Statement"— £5 fine. £10 for succeeding offence. (2) In the case of 1st Schedule articles sold with a "statutory statement" differing— (a) from the particulars marked or indicated by a mark placed on the parcel; (b) in articles delivered direct from ship or quay to a purchaser, from the particulars entered in the seller's register; (c) in articles which have not been on the premises of the seller, from the statutory statement given to the seller; the person giving the statutory statement offends unless he prove he has taken all reasonable steps to avoid offence. (3) Failure to add & required mark to the statutory statement is an offence. Fines as in (1) of this section. 9. (1) Person keeping a register or receiving a statutory statement relating to an article sold by them must preserve the register or statement for such a period as may be prescribed (up to four months) and produce it on demand to an Inspector. Fine up to £20. (2) All registers and statutory statements are subject to inspection. Fine up to £20. (3) An Inspector has entry at all reasonable times for purposes of examining registers or statutory statements. 10. In 1st Schedule descriptions which are trade descriptions under the Merchandise Marks Act, no proceedings shall be taken under that Act on grounds of false description. Administrative Provisions, Sampling, Analysis. 11. The Council's duties are to enforce the Act. To appoint an official "Agricultural Analyst," Inspectors and Official Samplers. The Inspectors and Official Samplers are to be whole-time Officers of the Council. A Deputy Agricultural Chemist may be appointed. The appointments are subject to the approval of the Minister. Two Councils may concur in making any appointment. 12. (1) An " Inspector " has reasonable powers of entry where he expects goods of Schedule 1 to have been prepared and stored for sale or consignment, or where goods of Schedules 1 and 2 have been stored for use, and he may take samples. If in this he act outside his limits of jurisdiction it shall be with the consent of the Council of the jurisdiction invaded. (2) Informal samples may be taken. (3) An Inspector appointed by the Minister may act in any county or county borough. If the Minister considers the powers insufficiently exercised by a Council, the Minister's Inspector may take samples, submit them for analysis and recover his expenses as a debt due to the Crown or as a civil debt. (4) If a retail parcel of 14 lbs. or less in weight be sampled the retailer may request that the whole parcel be bought. (5) The Inspector acting on railway premises will duly regard delay to traffic. 63 13. (1 and 2) A sample is divided in three parts, each of these is marked, fastened and sealed. Two go to the analyst, the third to the owner or seller. The analyst analyses one portion and retains the other. (3) If the buyer, owner or seller objects to the analyst's certificate of a sample, on payment of a fee the Government Analyst will analyse the retained portion of the sample and certify. (4) In any case of analysis the analyst shall receive with the sample the statutory statement or warranty, or a copy of the particulars marked on or indicated by a mark applied to the article sampled. (6) The certificate of analysis is to be supplied to the submitter of the sample, the purchaser, and to the owner or seller of the article whenever the sample is "formally" taken. 14. Provides for a £50 fine or six months' imprisonment for any person tampering with an article so as to procure an incorrect sampling or with a sample that has been taken. 15. Provides against obstruction to an Inspector. 16. Provides against disclosure of information obtained by an Inspector except to persons acting under the Act. 17. A Council may contribute to the expenses of an Agricultural Association in causing samples to be taken and analysed, may fix fees payable for the analysis and sampling at request of purchasers, and may fix different fees for different articles. The expenses of the Council will be defrayed out of the General Rate. 18. Returns of analyses are made quarterly to the Minister. 22. An analyst's certificate on a sample formally taken is sufficient evidence to the facts stated unless any party to proceedings requires the analyst as witness. 23. The Minister will make regulations for carrying the Act into operation; in particular— for varying the schedules, marking, limits of variation, sampling, methods of analysis, qualifications of " Agricultural Analysts," form of analysis certificates. 26. Each consignment to a purchaser constitutes a separate article for the purpose of the Act. The above abbreviated essentials show the purpose of the Act, that fertilisers shall be what they purport to be in nature, standard and quality, and foodstuffs shall have that standard value in nutrition through absence of dilution and contamination which is expected in a genuine article. The scope of the work implied and the organisation and expenses necessary to its satisfactory carrying on is not yet clear. Regulations will be made in due course. The Port and City will probably constitute an economical and natural grouping for the discharge of their obligations under the Act, this being carried out by a staff common to the grouping if and when approved. Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Regulations, 1925. The Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Regulations, 1925, require that Inspectors be definitely appointed for the purpose of carrying out these Regulations. The Section of the Regulations, Part III., Section 9, sub-section (1), provides that— " The following authorities and any officers authorised by them in writing shall also have power to enforce and execute this Part of these Regulations, namely :— "(a) Where the article of food is landed from a ship or aircraft in a place which is not within the jurisdiction of a Port Sanitary Authority, or where the article is imported in a vehicle and the Customs examination of that vehicle reaches a place outside such jurisdiction, the Council of the Borough (including the City of London and a Metropolitan Borough) or Urban or Rural District in which such place is situated. " (b) In every other case, the Port Sanitary Authority." 64 Therefore, the following Inspectors were appointed officers authorised to enforce and execute this part of the above-mentioned Regulations:— A. Garland. P. R. Lambe. W. G. Wetjen. W. Elward. J. H. Rolfe. F. J. Massie. W. W. Burr. W. J. Berry. H. R. Hopkins. W. Gray. R. Clifford. P. W. Coombe. Public Health (Imported Milk) Regulations, 1926. These Regulations require the Registration by Port and Riparian Sanitary Authorities of persons receiving imported milk and give power to the registering authorities, similar to that conferred by Section 2 of the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, in regard to retailers, to refuse registration or to remove a person from the register if the requirements of the Regulations in regard to the condition of the milk are not complied with. They came into operation on the 1st January, 1927. Public Health (Preservatives, &c., in Food) Amendment Regulations, 1927. These Regulations, dated 25th June, 1927, amend the principal Regulations of 1925. Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926. The above Act came into operation on 1st July, 1927. The practical points which arise out of this Act, as far as the Port of London Sanitary Authority is concerned, are as follows:— The three Local Authorities for London are the Port of London Sanitary Authority, the London County Council and the Common Council of the City of London, each acting within their own jurisdiction. Smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance is now deemed to be a nuisance irrespective of its colour. The expression "smoke" also includes soot, ash, grit and gritty particles. Fifty pounds (£50) is substituted for ten pounds (£10) as the maximum penalty under Section 4, sub-section 4, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Sea-going ships are specifically exempted from the provisions of this Act, and remain under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to smoke nuisance. Tugs and other vessels not coming under the designation of "a ship habitually used as a sea-going ship" are, however, not exempted from the Act. It is a good defence by the person charged in connection with a chimney sending forth smoke to show that he has used the best practicable means for preventing the nuisance, having regard to the cost, local conditions and circumstances, but the expression "best practicable means" has reference not only to plant for prevention of the nuisance, but also to the manner in which the plant is used. Any officer duly authorised by the Local Authority must notify the occupier of the premises on which the nuisance exists as soon as practicable after he has become aware thereof, and if that notification was not in writing, shall within twenty-four (24) hours of his becoming aware of the nuisance confirm the notification in writing. In practice, with regard to ships, your Medical Officer will become "aware of the nuisance" on receipt of the report, and would forthwith make the written notification, this being, in the words of the Act, "as soon as possible after he has become aware thereof." Any Local Authority may make Bye-laws and, if so required by the Ministry of Health, shall make Bye-laws with regard to colour, density and content or period of emission of smoke. 65 TABLE XLI.—General Summary, and Analysis, of the Sanitary Inspections of Vessels, &c., in the Port of London, for the year ended 31st December, 1927.

The Shellfish beds, for which orders for relaying of shellfish for human food and for efficient sterilization of cockles and winkles have been made, reach from Canvey Island on the West to N. Shoebury on the East. No case of Infectious Disease attributed to shellfish from these beds has been notified to your Medical Officer during the year. SEWAGE DISPOSAL—SOUTHEND-ON-SEA. For the elucidation of the proposed Scheme of Sewage Disposal at Southendon-Sea, reference to which appeared on page 66 of my Annual Report for the year 1926, your Medical Officer met the Consulting Engineer to the Corporation of Southend-on-Sea. The Southend-on-Sea Corporation Bill, 1926, is now an Act. The Port of London Sanitary Authority did not oppose the Bill, which abrogated certain powers of the Authority in the Act of ]909. The proposed Scheme was fully reported upon by your Medical Officer as follows "A Bill is at present before Parliament to make further provision with respect to the disposal of sewage. The existing sewage and sewage disposal works of the Corporation of Southend are insufficient for dealing with the largely increased population of the Borough. This increase is about 2½ times since 1909, the date of the previous Sewage Act. 71 It is therefore necessary to alter or repeal the provisions contained in the Southend-on-Sea Corporation Act, 1909, so as to enable the Corporation to build additional works and discharge from them into the sea. No such discharge into the estuary of the River Thames will be undertaken until screens for the removal from the sewage of gross solid matter have been constructed and sewage tanks provided for the sedimentation of all sewage entering the sewers of the Corporation. Sewage and storm water entering the sewers of the Corporation at a rate exceeding three times the average daily dry weather flow shall not of necessity undergo screening and sedimentation. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal will be followed. The present degree of purification will be lessened. The Scheme provides for the outflow of sewage at the Eastern boundary of the Borough below low-water mark, at a distance of two miles E.S.E. of the present outfall and just to the West of a peculiar and constant low-tide neck of land from which its attendant water-inlet takes the name of ' Knock Swin.' The state of purification of sewage thrown from a seaside resort, such as is Southend-on-Sea, need not, I feel, be for the consideration of the Port of London Sanitary Authority provided solids are screened and a degree of purification beyond this attained. This Authority's interest, though extending to foreshore pollution, is nob of the vital moment in the same matter as is that proper to Southend-on-Sea. As the Authority dealing with shell-fish layings, however, the Port of London Sanitary Authority is interested. Mr. Deane, the Consulting Engineer detailed on behalf of the Corporation of Southend to conduct float experiments with regard to the flow of water at and about the Knock Swin, i.e., the outfall, has supplied for the perusal of the Port of London Sanitary Authority a series of maps of his experiments, which trace clearly the direction of flow from the proposed sewage outfall at various states of the varying tides. These distinctly show, amongst other matters of interest: — (1) That the set of the tide in flood trends Eastward and Northward over the flats which lie in front of Southend, especially Thorpe Bay. (2) That the set of the tides on the ebb is parallel to the shore at first, then trending Southward over the flats. (3) That the flow in calm weather from the proposed sewage outfall would reach the Mouse Light, a total distance of nine miles on one ebb tide. (4) An extremely interesting record of the flood tide in and about the Swin. The presence and shape of the Swin and projecting knock are suggestive of a peculiar condition of flow, but one is hardly prepared for the findings that floats laid at low water at the Swin mouth are actually carried Northward and Eastward past Shoeburyness and over the Maplin Sands as the tide flows, so that, as Mr. Deane reports, ' at neap tides most of the water required to cover the Maplin Sands in front of Shoeburyness finds its way through the Knock Swin, passing to the North-East. Had it been possible to follow the floats further, I should have expected them to have continued on, in a North-Easterly direction, under the influence of the ebb tides.' The significance of this is that a portion of the last emptyings of the proposed sewer would be carried, on the rising tide, away over the Maplin Sands in a well-diluted state by a back-eddy current due to Shoeburyness. This current helps to account for the persistent shape and position of the Knock Swin, a curve, roughly, North and East. The two areas of foreshore affected by the flood flow of the ebb tailings from the sewer would be the areas C and D, which have been placed under orders by your Worshipful Committee as shell-fish layings. I am of opinion that the question of pollution of shell-fish beds is but little affected by the proposed change of outfall position, any slight disadvantage in areas C and D being compensated by slight improvement in areas A and B owing to the moving of the outfall to the E.S.E. This consideration only applies to dry weather sewage flows, and even so, the lessened degree of purification proposed and increase of population since the foreshore shell-fish beds of this district were under review have to be borne in mind. It is advantageous that the area D under the Shell-Fish Orders of the Port Sanitary Authority was so arranged as to include the. lower portion of the Maplin Sands. The interests of the Port of London Sanitary Authority are foreshore pollution and pollution of shell-fish layings. The shell-fish layings of this district are already under Orders. I would, therefore, suggest that there is no cause for opposition to the present Southend Sewage Scheme by this Authority." Before the 1926 Scheme comes into operation it will be necessary to interfere with the standard of purification laid down in the 1909 Act, but this standard will not be lowered below the eventual standard (say, 50 percent. purification against the present 60-70 per cent.) during the carrying out of certain works which require that the Southend filter beds shall be no longer in operation. The eventual change over of the system and the time of change over, i.e., 1927-1930, should naturally, it would appear, be considered a continuous period. Although by criticism and formal enquiry the Scheme could be held up, it could not be eventuallv altered. 72 The Scheme allows for purification of about the same standard as that in vogue in London at the present time, but the discharge of a lesser effluent is into a vastly greater and less confined body of water. The difference between the present position and that Of 1909 is that, owing to the growth of Southend, the shell-fish from the layings in the neighbourhood were, in 1916, no longer deemed fit for direct consumption, expression to which fact has been given by your Worshipful Committee in the orders relating to those layings. It appears that the Engineers' difficulty is that objection might conceivably be taken to the temporary discharge of effluent which has only been screened and sedimented for sludge removal. the effluent not passing through the filter beds. On Thursday, the 17th February, by the courtesy of Dr. Calvert, of the Ministry of Health, I was enabled to be present at a consultation at Southend and examine the temporary Scheme which is now under Ministry of Health enquiry. On being asked my opinion, I gave that which is embodied in the recommendation following:— "That the temporary Scheme be not postponed by any action of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, seeing that the functions of this Authority are not interfered with in the Scheme and that the proposed effluent, during constructional work, would be of the same degree of purity as the final approved effluent, and that the Minister of Health be SO informed." "On Thursday, the 21st April, your Medical Officer attended an enquiry in connection with a portion of the Southend Sewage Scheme, the site of this portion bordering on the River Roach. It had not been understood by the Corporation of Southend-on-Sea that the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority extended to the waters of the Roach, and therefore to the shell-fish beds therein, but by chance the advertisement of the enquiry was brought to my notice. The Treasury Minute runs as follows: — 'and the said Port of London shall include the Islands in Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushey Islands, and so much of the said Creek and watercourse as extends from it to the town of Rochford. . . It is proposed that 160 acres of land be acquired for the purpose of treating the sludge from the sewage of Southend; 110 acres of this is to be used for the purpose. A band of 250 feet in depth) next the River does not come into use, nor does a 'Y' area from which a ditch empties itself at low water by tide valve, and which is low ground. Only one-quarter of the proposed 110 acres would come into use in any one year, so that each portion of the ground would remain unused over a period: of three years. There is no possibility of crude sewage getting into the River, the water only draining, into ditches after considerable percolation through soil. Much of the liquid would never reach the ditches at all, but would be lost by evaporation. The soil is loam, clay, sand and gravel, and for the most part very suitable to the purpose of sludge treatment. The situation of the farm is within one mile and to the North-East of Barling village. The Engineer expressed the opinion that only gross carelessness on the part of those working the system could permit of crude sewage entering the River, and that the oyster fisheries lying in the Roach are safe as far as the Scheme is concerned. On behalf of the Fisheries, it was urged that nothing in the Order preserved the 250 feet band next the River from use should it be so desired by the Southend Authority, and that the present intention not to use this band was not sufficient safeguard. With adherence to this intention, it seems probable that the River Roach will not be polluted further than is its present state by reason of the town of Rochford situated at its tide head. The point having been emphasised, your Medical Officer saw no reason to raise any objection on behalf of your Worshipful Committee." SEWAGE WORKS. Strood Rural District Council. In connection with this matter, reported upon on page 67 of my Annual Report for 1926, in November your Medical Officer received a letter from the Ministry of Health stating that the Minister would be prepared to consider any representation that the Port of London Sanitary Authority desired to make regarding the proposals of the Strood Rural District Council. An official enquiry had already been held, and as a matter of urgency your Medical Officer wrote to the Ministry to the effect that some details of a Scheme for Sewage Disposal submitted to the Port of London Sanitary Authority in June of 1926 showed provisions for works which it was proposed were to be placed within 300 feet of the staff residence and wards of this Authority's Hospital at Denton; that the suggested site of the works under the Scheme was to the West of the Hospital and in the direction from which the prevailing winds blow across the Hospital grounds and the prospect of the Hospital being bounded on two sides, first by the Gravesend Sewage Works to the South, which are a source of serious nuisance to the Hospital Staff from time to time, and the proposed Strood Urban District Council's Works close by on the West, was a matter of concern to the Port Sanitary Authority, and, therefore, the Authority would be glad if this could be taken into account in connection with any decision on the Strood Urban District Council's Scheme at Denton. A different site has since been decided upon for the sewage works. 73 FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE. There was a slight and vigorously circumvented outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in the neighbourhood of Denton Hospital, Gravesend, early in the year. This Authority was approached by the Officer-in-Charge under the Ministry of Agriculture with a view to disinfection of a few garments. Assent to the disinfection of these in Denton Hospital was immediately given on behalf of the Port Sanitary Authority, and no charges having been incurred by this Authority in the matter, the disinfection having taken place coincidently with normal disinfections at the Hospital, no charge was made for this slight service. LEAGUE OF NATIONS. Visit of Foreign Medical Officers. On two occasions during the year, namely the 26th March and 21st November, foreign Medical Officers visiting this country under the auspices of the League of Nations were afforded opportunities of seeing the process of Port Sanitary administration in the Port of London. The Deputations included Medical Officers from Belgium, Brazil, China, Crown Colonies, Czecho-Slovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, North Ireland, Irish Free State, Italy, Jugo-Slavia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Roumania, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, United States of America. There were also present Representatives of the League of Nations Health Section, the Ministry of Health, London County Council, the Society of Medical Officers of Health, and various Counties and Boroughs. The Hospital at Denton and some of the Docks were visited, and the system of Port Sanitation as applied to the Port of London explained. ALIENS ORDER, 1920. Medical Inspection of Aliens. The arrival of aliens in the Port of London is fairly constant,, the principal sources being :— From Dunkirk 1 vessel daily. ,, Rotterdam 1 ,, ,, ,, Ostend and Antwerp Exceeding 1 daily. ,, Gothenburg 2 vessels weekly. ., Russia and Danzig Free State 2 ,, ,, ,, Other ports Several weekly. Ordinary inspection is confined to passengers remaining in the country three months or less and passengers in transit, except in such cases as detailed inspection is deemed advisable. Detailed examination is, as a rule, limited to transmigrants and passengers remaining in the country for a period longer than three months. Aliens removed to the Port Sanitary Hospital for treatment during the year were as follows:— Suffering from Pneumonia 1 ,, ,, Varicella 1 ,, ,, Measles 2 ,, ,, Diphtheria 3 Total 7 The transmigrants have been uniformly found clean; those proceeding to America showed that they had been deloused, and their baggage bore documentary evidence of disinfection and delousing. Other classes were clean and free from Phthisis, and those admitted under Ministry of Labour permits had no disability which would interfere with work. The seven mental cases in respect of which certificates were issued were all deportees from, America en route to their country of origin. 74 Early in May a service of passenger boats carrying aliens between Dunkirk and Tilbury Dock was introduced, the vessels arriving at about 6 a.m. daily. Under the circumstances, it became necessary to revert to the arrangement which formerly obtained in the Port of London, by which a Medical Officer was free from ordinary boarding duty and whose services were utilised for alien examination and other work. This necessitated the temporary appointment of another Assistant Medical Officer. In connection with this service an efficient shed for inspections, with offices for the Medical Officer, was erected in the Tilbury Basin shed adjacent by the Port of London Authority.

In accordance with Section 3 of the Canal Boats Act, 1884, I beg to present herewith the Annual Report on the working of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations within the district of the Port of London Sanitary Authority during the year ended 31st December, 1927. The Acts and Regulations apply within the whole of the district under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Sanitary Authority, including the River and Docks, as a "canal" for the purposes of the Act, "includes any river, inland navigation, lake, or water being within the body of a county, whether it is or not within the ebb and flow of the tide. The navigation, in addition to the enclosed Docks, includes the following navigable tributary wTaters and creeks of the River Thames:— On the right bank— From Teddington downwards:— Wandsworth Creek (River Wandle). Hay's Dock. St. Saviour's Dock. Part of the Grand Surrey Canal within the Surrey Commercial Dock. Deadman's Dock. Deptford Creek (River Ravensbourne). Dartford Creek (Rivers Cray and Darenth). The entrance to Gravesend Canal. Cliffe Creek. Yantlet and Coalmouth Creeks. Part of the River Medway, and of the Swale. On the left bank—From Teddington downwards:— The entrance of the River Brent. Hammersmith Creek. Chelsea Dock. Grosvenor Dock. Limekiln Creek. Bow Creek (River Lea). Barking Creek (River Roding). Rainham Creek (River Ingrebourne). Mucking Creek. Thames Haven. Hole Haven. Havengore Creek. Potton and Rushley Creeks. River Roach as far as Rochford. RIVER. The whole of this area is divided into three districts, known as the Upper, Middle and Lower, each district being in charge of an Inspector, as follows:— Upper District Teddington to Greenwich Inspector Coombe, £180 per annum. Middle District Greenwich to Erith Ditto, ditto. Lower District Erith to seaward limits of the Port of} London (including part of the River} Inspector Clifford, £190 per annum. Medway).} The Docks are divided into four districts, known as the Central, Eastern, Western and the Gravesend District:— Central District West India Dock Inspector Elward, £300 per annum. South-West- India Dock Poplar Dock Millwall Dock Eastern District Royal Victoria Dock Inspector Berry, £280 per annum. Inspector Lambe, £300 per annum. East India Dock 1 Royal Albert Dock King George V. Dock Western District London Dock Inspector Gray, £200 per annum. St. Katharine Dock Regent's Dock Surrey Commercial Dock Gravesend District Tilbury Dock Inspector Massie, £290 per annum. Left Shore, from Purfleet-down Right Shore, from Erith down The total number of inspections for the year was 136, representing a nett number of 83 boats. The remainder—53—represents repeated visits by Inspectors of this Authority. 76 The number of boats not conforming to the Acts and Regulations was 44 (inspected on 64 occasions, or 46.32 of the total inspections, the percentage for the previous, five years being 37.06 percent.). In addition to the above, 5 boats were at the time of visit found with the cabin door locked, there being no persons on board. Inspection was therefore impossible, and these visits are not included in the number of the boats inspected. With reference to the various infringements of the Act Unregistered Boats. 1927.
