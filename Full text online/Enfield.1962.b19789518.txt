AC.439(1) EMF 46 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1962 Borough Council of Enfield ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health (WILLIAM D. HYDE, M.B., Ch.B., D.P.H.) FOR 1962 3 ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Enfield. I have pleasure in presenting my Annual Report for 1962. In a Borough like Enfield, with its wide variety of environmental conditions, ranging from open country through residential property of all kinds, commercial premises, and shopping centres, to industiial areas, the problems of environmental health are indeed varied, complex and all-embracing. A study of the list of inspections and visits made by the staff shows this clearly. However, the basic problems of control of infectious disease, provision and maintenance of fit dwellings, sound drainage and sanitary disposal of sewage and refuse, clean, pure and wholesome food and water, clean air, and freedom from excessive noise, remain the essential objectives of the Health Department. All of these have been pursued with vigour during the year under review, and satisfactory results can be claimed. There is one aspect of healthy living, namely, exercise, to which I have referred in the past and which is essentially a matter for the individual. Enfield is more fortunately placed than many other districts in its possession of parks and open spaces, so let us make full use of them. Each one of us who is employed in a sedentary occupation should take the opportunities presented, to participate in some form of outdoor activity related, of course, to age, sex, and physical ability. There is excuse only for few to lead a completely sedentary life. Modern conditions of living make this more important than ever. "Good Health" cannot be magically summoned from a glass or a bottle, and means more than simply freedom from illness. Although the genetic factors in health and illness are important and becoming more fully understood, a possible relationship is suspected between lack of exercise, faulty diet, and some forms of heart disease. Exercise may therefore be considered a necessary part of preventive medicine. Although strict observance of what is considered to be a healthy way of life is no absolute guarantee of fitness and freedom from disease, and some people seem to ignore it with impunity, the 4 evidence in favour of abiding by the accepted rules of health is overwhelming. Fatal accidents annually form a distressing part of my report, and it is disturbing this year to record an increase of three fatal home accidents, four fatal road accidents, and also an increase of six cases of suicide. The details are recorded elsewhere in this report, but I would like to refer to a few aspects of the problem, as these figures do not show the full picture of incapacity, disability and suffeiing associated with these events. As usual, the majority of fatal accidents in the home were due to falls in elderly people, resulting in broken bones and subsequent lung complications leading to death. These accidents continue to occur in spite of the ever increasing and concentrated publicity on dangers in the home and the gathering knowledge regarding safer house and appliance design. The prevention of road accidents may not be within the province of the Health Department, but once again, I wonder if the real cause of most of those accidents is not linked with haste, impatience, selfishness and downright bad manners by all categories of road users—all factors well within the bounds of prevention. The problem of suicide is undoubtedly a difficult and serious one requiring much intensive research, and one in which, up to the present, we appear to have had little success. The Smoke Control programme continues to proceed according to plan and by the end of the year 1197 acres and 5364 dwellings, etc., had been included in Smoke Control Orders. Certain industrial installations gave cause for complaint, and observations, with subsequent action, were necessary. During the period 3rd - 7th December, a dense fog covered the London area including Enfield, and, as is recorded elsewhere in this report, the smoke and sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere showed considerable increases. This foggy weather was followed on the 26th December, by a lengthy period of snowy weather. As was to be expected, these conditions were coincident with noticeable effects on health conditions, most evident in an increase in the number of deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia as well as heart conditions. Once again, the unauthorised parking of caravans created considerable concern during the year. Much time and effort were unfortunately required to be expended in dealing with this recurring problem under existing legislation, action being taken to remove no less than three hundred and twenty-five caravans from unauthorised sites. 5 Matters concerning the provision of private caravan sites were also dealt with and the possibility of municipally. Controlled sites for various types of caravan-dwellers was pursued. In my report last year I referred to the diagnosis of a case of smallpox in the London area at the end of 1961, with the consequent anxiety and disturbance that arose when the infection also appeared in other parts of the country. Although no cases occurred in Enfield, much time, over many weeks, was spent in dealing with contacts by vaccination and surveillance. The Health Department staff concentrated its efforts mainly on vaccinating persons likely to have to deal with the infection, and also contacts of possible cases, in order to produce a barrier of immunity around any potential new case. Apart from the logical wisdom of this method over that of indiscriminate mass vaccination, it is sometimes the only possible approach when the resources of the Health Department are strained and vaccine lymph may not be in plentiful supply. There was, however, a great demand for vaccination from the public generally, but it was not considered necessary nor desirable to arrange public vaccination clinics. Nevertheless, over fifteen thousand persons were vaccinated during the year, mainly by general medical practitioners during the weeks of anxiety. With regard to infectious disease generally, there were comparatively few notifications during the year. The only infection in which there was an increase over the previous year was Sonne dysentery, which fluctuates from year to year, and seventy seven cases, a comparatively small number, were notified. There were no cases of diphtheria nor poliomyelitis, the last case of diphtheria being in 1948, and poliomyelitis in 1958. In our enthusiasm to encourage immunisation against poliomyelitis we must not neglect immunisation against diphtheria lest we return to the days when diphtheria was prevalent. With regard to the Vital Statistics of the Borough, there was no significant change in the Death Rate, and the Infant Mortality Rate, which was slightly lower this year than last year, compares favourably with the National figure. The Birth Rate rose to its highest figure since the immediate post-war years, and there was unfortunately one maternal death, the first since 1959, making a total of two in the last five years. In conclusion I would like to express my appreciation of the service of the staff of the Health Department during the year. William D. Hyde, Medical Officer of Health. 6 BOROUGH OF ENFIELD Alderman E. T. Hendrick, J.P. Mayor Alderman A. H. Chambers Deputy Mayor Aldermen : Mrs. G. M. Jay, J.P. W. G. Bowyer, Esq. D. R. J. Boxall, Esq.

(Number of deaths of infants aged four weeks but under one year of age per 1,000 live births.) 12 FATAL ACCIDENTS. During the year under review there were twelve fatal home accidents to Enfield residents, this figure being three more than the previous year. All, except one of these accidents occurred amongst elderly people, eight being over eighty years of age. The precipitating cause of death in eight cases was a fall, leading in most instances to fractured bones followed usually by lung complications. Three other deaths were due to accidental coal gas poisoning, and one due to burns through clothing becoming ignited by an electric fire. The number of fatal road accidents to Enfield residents was nineteen, an increase of five on the previous year. Unfortunately, there were also fourteen (four male and ten female) cases of suicide, four of which were aged between 25 and 44 years, three aged between 45 and 64 years, four aged between 65 and 70 years, and two over 70 years. There was also a girl aged 17 years. It is disquieting to note the sum total of human misery recorded in these paragraphs and to ponder over the fact that so much could and should be prevented. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACTS, 1948 AND 1951. No action was necessary during the year under these Acts. Such cases as were brought to the notice of the Health Department were dealt with by the Medical Officer of Health in cooperation either with the Medical Practitioners or Welfare Officer, and the patients voluntarily agreed to go to Hospital or suitable Home. Most old people show a natural reluctance to leave their homes, which sometimes consist of a single room in a dirty and unhygienic state owing to their inability to look after the premises. Some should not be living alone, and although we must not be hasty to criticize, there appears to be in some cases a need for the awakening of responsibility of the family to its aged members. In some instances, where reluctance to leave their homes is encountered, provision of Home Help and District Nurse Services can be arranged and a careful watch on the situation maintained by members of the Health Department Staff. Compulsory removal in the interests of the old person is rarely enforced, as persuasion usually succeeds in the end. 13 AMBULANCE SERVICE The headquarters of this service which comes under the control of the County Medical Officer, Middlesex County Council, are at Kenton, Middlesex. All telephone calls and enquiries regarding the ambulance service in Enfield are routed through an ambulance control depot which is situated in Edmonton. The Emergency telephone call service can be used for urgent calls. For dealing with emergencies in Enfield, one accident ambulance is kept at Ponders End Fire Station and another at the Ambulance Sick Removal Depot, The Ridgeway, near Chase Farm Hospital. There are also kept at the Sick Removal Depot, a number of ambulances for dealing with more routine duties including the transport of outpatients and sitting cases to hospitals for treatment. WATER SUPPLY The Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, except for part of the Hadley Wood and Cockfosters area, which is supplied by the Lee Valley Water Company. Both of these Authorities take regular and frequent samples for analysis. Copies of the reports on these are sent to the Health Department, and have shown satisfactory results. There was no cause to suspect any contamination during the year. The question of well-water supplies, both in connection with dwelling-houses and industrial premises, throughout the Borough has received the careful attention of the Department during the year, and every care has been exercised to see that such supplies are not used for drinking purposes where mains water supply is available. There is now only one dwelling in Enfield which relies solely on well water for its water supply and this is under regular supervision. MEDICAL ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES. The following medical examinations or assessments of employees were carried out during the year:— (1) Superannuation Act: Medical examinations 39 Assessments without medical examinations 64 (2) Sick Pay Scheme : Medical examinations 75 Assessments without medical examinations 74 (3) Special examinations for fitness to continue employment 15 14 PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1961 The purpose of the Act is mainly to amend the provisions of the Public Health Act, 1936, relating to building bye-laws and trade effluents, and also public health matters formerly dealt with under local acts. Part II of the Act deals with building regulations, sewers, drains and sanitary conveniences ; buildings and structures ; accumulations of rubbish ; and filthy or verminous premises and articles. Part III deals with the prevention and notification of infectious disease, and gives powers of medical examination of persons in certain circumstances; makes provision for information to be furnished by the occupier of premises in cases of notifiable disease or food poisoning; provides for the exclusion of children from places of entertainment, etc., with a view to preventing the spread of infectious disease ; makes provisions for compensating persons who, on the request of the Medical Officer of Health discontinue work to prevent the spread of notifiable disease ; and in connection with the selling to children under the age of fourteen years, by dealers in rags and old clothes, adds any animal, fish, bird or other living thing to " article " as used in the Public Health Act, 1936. Part IV deals with streets and public places. Part V deals with trade effluents. Part VI deals with a miscellaneous number of items, including the power to reduce the numbers of pigeons and other birds in built-up areas, as well as powers to make bye-laws relating to hairdressers and barbers. (Byelaws have been in existence in Enfield since 1937.) HOUSING Number of new houses erected during the year by:— (a) Local Authority 91 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons 220 With State assistance (included in above totals):— (a) Local Authority 91 (b) Other Local Authorities — (c) Other bodies or persons — 1.

One of the most important provisions of this legislation is the power given to local authorities to deal with houses in multiple occupation, and action was taken in this respect during the year. HOUSE PURCHASE AND HOUSING ACT, 1959. This Act deals with financial assistance towards the provision of five basic housing improvements, namely, a bath or shower, a wash-hand basin, a water closet, a hot water system, and a food store. There is also a Discretionary Grant Scheme for a wider range of improvements and conversions. Many inspections are necessary in connection with these provisions, and during the year 1,746 visits to premises were made by the Inspectorial staff. RENT ACT 1957 No. of applications received for Certificates of Disrepair .. 15 No. of undertakings received from landlords 11 No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued 4 No. of applications for cancellation of Certificates of Disrepair received from landlords 3 No. of objections to cancellations received from tenants 1 No. of Certificates of Disrepair cancelled 2 No. of Certificates as to Remedying of Defects which the Landlord has Undertaken to Remedy : Issued to tenants — Issued to landlords 7 THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES ACT, 1958. THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES (HYGIENE) REGULATIONS, 1958. THE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS (PREVENTION OF CRUELTY) REGULATIONS, 1958. THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE REPORTS (APPOINTED DAY) ORDER, 1959. In proposing to accept the Council's Slaughterhouse Report, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food suggested 1st January, 1963, as the Appointed Day by which the sole slaughterhouse in the Borough shall comply with the requirements of the Regulations, providing that in the event of no progress being made 17 in obtaining a new site by the Autumn of 1962, he would be prepared to consider an application from the Council for further deferment of the Appointed Day. Efforts to find an alternative site proved unsuccessful, but towards the latter part of the year the Minister of Housing and Local Government allowed an appeal against the planning authority's refusal for an extension of the slaughterhouse premises on the existing site. On further representation by the Council, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food finally accepted the Slaughterhouse Report which had been held in abeyance pending the outcome of the appeal, and made 1st July, 1963, the Appointed Day from which the slaughterhouse must comply with the Regulations.

During the year, one thousand four hundred and thirty-one visits were made to food premises of all types, including Canteens, Public houses, Bakehouses, Ice-cream shops and Vehicles, and Hawkers' stalls and Storage premises. Improvements of a general character were carried out in forty-six premises. Also, during the year, the layout of stalls in the open market was improved. The old stalls were replaced by stalls of tubular frames with striped plastic sheeting. This standard arrangement has not only improved the appearance of the market but has simplified inspection. Two commercial canteens were rebuilt during the year and two new factories provided canteens of a high standard. In addition to general visits to food premises, eighty-seven visits were made to forty-one clubs under the Licensing Act, 1961, and the importance of food hygiene was stressed on every possible occasion. The provision of wash hand basins in public houses was again successfully encouraged. Many complaints regarding food were investigated and the necessary action taken. These complaints involved food alleged to contain foreign bodies of various kinds including larvae and adult insects, and spoilage by birds. Other complaints involved the presence of mould, decomposition of fish and canned meat, discolouration and abnormal taste and smell. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 The following table gives details of the samples of foods and drugs procured under the above Act in Enfield by the Food and Drugs Authority during 1962:— Article. Total samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Milk (new) 83 — Milk (various) 14 — Butter 9 — Bread and Cakes 3 2 Carried forward 109 2 21 Articles. Total samples procured. Unsatisfactory. Brought forward 109 2 Cheese and Cheese Products 11 — Cream 8 — Drugs 18 — Fish and Fish Products 13 — Fruit—Fresh, Canned and Dried 12 — Ice Cream 8 — Liver 8 — Margarine 9 — Meat and Meat Products 54 — Preserves 5 — Sausages 11 — Soft Drinks and Fruit Juice 4 — Spirits 4 — Vinegar 11 — Miscellaneous 26 2 Total: 311 4 Of the total of three hundred and eleven samples procured four were found to be unsatisfactory. One of these was a sample of bread arising from a complaint by the matron of an old people's home, that she had received from a baker two wrapped sliced loaves which contained foreign matter. The Public Analyst certified that the sample contained 26 slices of bread of a total of 58 slices which were contaminated by dirty dough containing machine oil or grease. Having had regard to the excellent record of the baker concerned an official caution was issued. Another sample of bread, produced by another baker was complained of by a resident in the Borough and was found to contain hemp and cotton fibres. It appeared likely that the source of the fibres was from a flour sack, and again, in view of the record of the bakers, a caution was sent to them. Arising from a complaint from another old people's home a sample of self-raising flour was sent to the Public Analyst who certified that raising ingredients were virtually absent, and that the flour was not " self-raising." The error was said to be due to a tie-on label on the sack having been torn off and the flour complained of was replaced by the millers. In the circumstances a letter of caution was sent to the millers. The fourth incorrect sample was of a powdered mushioom soup-mix which was incorrectly described as " soup." The importers have arranged for correction of the label so as correctly to designate the food. 22 In addition to samples purchased in the Borough for analysis or for examination, a total of 34 labelled stacks and displays of fish, 276 meat, 189 apples, and 93 various types of citrus fruit and soft fruit were examined in the shops. 94 stacks of vegetables and 25 of other miscellaneous foods were also examined. Formal samples are selectively procured from the retail shops based on these examinations of labelled displays of natural foods where there is doubt as to the accuracy of the labelling or where there is need for further examination. The inspectors of the Department have over a number of years acquired a considerable expertise in the identification of cuts of meat and of varieties of fish and fruit. Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887 - 1953. Inspections are carried out under the above Acts to ensure that the requirements of the various Marking Orders relating to the indication of origin of imported foodstuffs are applied. Inspections were made at 244 premises, 143 displays of meat, 325 of apples, 186 of tomatoes, 308 of poultry, and 12 of bacon, were examined. Only minor breaches of the Orders, which were dealt with by verbal warnings, have been disclosed, apart from two traders, one of whom was sent an official caution for selling American lamb's liver as " Empire," and the other of whom sold Yugoslav meat and offal without disclosing its origin and inferring that it was in fact English. Safe Milk. Forty samples of raw milk were procured in the Borough and tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli. All were satisfactory. Seventy-five samples of pasteurised and sterilised milk were procured from retailers in the Borough and tested to ascertain whether or not pasteurisation or sterilisation had been correctly performed. No failure has been reported. Fifty-two inspections of premises at which milk is pasteurised or kept for sale, were carried out during the year to ensure that the premises conceined conformed to the requirements of the Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires prepacked food to be marked with the name and address of the packer or labeller, or to bear a registered trade mark ; to be marked with its common or usual name or its appropriate designation ; and to bear a statement of ingredients if the food consists of more than one ingredient. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed. A total of 241 premises have been visited in connection with the Order, and 1,425 items of food were examined. One infringement was disclosed. This was a packet of powdered soup described as " watercresr soup," in respect of which the ingredients were not stated in the manner prescribed by the Order. The importer was required to make the necessary corrections to the labelling of the food. 23 Labelling and Advertising Infringements. A considerable amount of work was done in the year which, while it did not arise from samples and inspections in the Borough of Enfield, nevertheless has the effect of protecting the residents of each county district. The matters mentioned below were of nationally retailed articles of food, which are widely distributed throughout the County. Several manufacturers and importers were reminded of the obligation to put on the labels of foods the name and address of the packer or labeller. Similar action was taken in respect of pickles, canned peas and mixed vegetables which did not beai a statement of ingredients. One manufacturer of ice cream was found to be putting all the statutory declarations on the base of the carton. He was reminded that these declaiations are required to be both conspicuous and prominent. Two advertisements for honey did not disclose that the honeys offered were of foreign origin. The Merchandise Marks Act requires this, and letters were sent to the advertisers reminding them of their obligations to declare the origin in advertisements. Some pre-packed lamb chops found to be generally on sale were of imported origin. The declaration in such a case is required to be in half inch letters ; the lettering used was so small as to be quite inconspicuous, and the packers were required to comply with the prescribed conditions. Matters dealt with under the Food and Drugs Act by correspondence included a sample of cream cheese containing less milk fat than was considered sufficient to justify the title. Five examples of cake-mixes, which were not complete mixes in that other additions such as egg or milk were necessary before the mix could be used, were found. The manufacturers were required prominently to show what additions were necessary. The manufacturers of four brands of milk pudding which were described on the label as " creamed rice " were challenged on the ground that the product was in fact a rice milk pudding and not creamed rice. Correction to the labels was secured. The manufacturer of a lemon juice was challenged that a claim on the label for slimming properties for the juice was not justified, and he amended his labels to delete the claim. A sample of cream was procured which was labelled " thick cream." The fat content of this cream was less than the standard prescribed for thick cream and the product was re-labelled " sterilised cream." A manufacturer of a canned meat product claimed on the label that it was " full of lean red meat." In fact, the meat content was no more than is normal for this class of product, and the manufacturer was therefore challenged as to the accuracy of the claim. It was withdrawn. 24 The manufacturers of several breakfast cereals were challenged on the ground that the labels claimed the foods to be " vitamin enriched." The vitamins present did not provide one half of the daily requirement which, it is considered, is the minimum to support claim to enrichment. The labels were amended to " vitamin fortified " which, because vitamins were added, was true. A sample of ice lollies for which it was claimed that glucose was present, was found on analysis not to be correct. The lollies originally it was found, had been made with added glucose, but glucose had been dropped from the recipe. The label was not amended to conform to the new recipe, and was therefore incorrect. Reference to glucose was deleted from the new labels. It was claimed for a sample of chopped pork that it contained " more meat." In fact the percentage of meat was no greater than that of comparable products and the manufacturer was required to delete the claim. A sample of butter mintoes was labelled " made with butter." This was not true ; other fats were present as well; the label was amended after representations to the manufacturer to " contains butter." A sample of sodium fluoride tablets was found on analysis to be deficient of the stated amount of the chemical. Because, in spite of the deficiency in the chemical, it was considered that the efficacy of the tablets was not impaired, the manufacturer was sent a letter of caution. Two samples of instant coffee were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative not at the time permitted in instant coffee. The manufacturers and importers concerned were sent letters of caution. Similar action was taken in respect of a sample of dried apricots which were found to contain sulphur dioxide. The quantity of preservative would have been satisfactory if its presence had been declared, and the manufacturers were required suitably to amend the label.

WHOOPING COUGH IMMUNISATION 1,475 children were immunised against Whooping Cough for the first time during the year, and 827 received re-inforcing doses. POLIOMYELITIS IMMUNISATION Prior to the first of April, immunisation was carried out by the use of the Salk-type vaccine by injection, but from the first of April the Sabin-type attenuated live vaccine by mouth, was used in the Clinics. By the end of the year, 8,025 persons had received a complete course of immunisation and 3,784 an incomplete course. TETANUS IMMUNISATION 1,664 children were immunised against Tetanus and 982 received a reinforcing dose. DIPHTHERIA For the fourteenth year in succession no case of Diphtheria has occurred in the Borough. POLIOMYELITIS For the fourth year in succession no case of Poliomyelitis has occurred in the Borough. 28 SMALLPOX VACCINATION Seven thousand six hunched and forty-four persons received primary vaccination and seven thousand five hundied and forty-six re-vaccination. The considerable increase in the number of vaccinations against smallpox was due to the widespread desire for vaccination as a result of the importation into the country of smallpox, as referred to elsewhere in this report. FOOD POISONING Of the seven cases of food poisoning which were notified during the year, all were single cases due to Salmonella Organisms. SONNE DYSENTERY The incidence of mild dysentery due to Shigella Sonnei showed a considerable increase on last year's figure, with seventy-seven cases as against four for the previous year, but this is an infection which is likely to vary considerably in incidence, especially as its spread is so easily encouraged by careless personal hygiene.

Waters, Organising Secretary. Arrangements were made for the Unit to be set up in various factories for examination of organised groups, and at other sites for the general public. A total of 15,996 persons were examined, 4,039 taking advantage of the sessions available to the general public. A detailed summary of the findings of the survey is given below. This shows that there were more cases of lung cancer discovered than cases of pulmonary tuberculosis requiring immediate treatment. 30 The response of the people of Enfield to the opportunity of taking advantage of this form of health investigation is always good, and this year was no exception. Male Female Total Total number X-Rayed 10,166 5,830 15,996 Total number requiring further investigation 114 71 185 Apart from the value of the diagnosis of these cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, it will be seen that a variety of other chest conditions of importance were discovered.

Two of the rodent operatives carried out sewer treatment by Sodium Fluoracetate in damp coarse oatmeal involving 1,441 manholes. The other two operatives dealt with surface infestations. 1,564 premises were inspected during the year, and of these 462 were found to be infested with rats or mice. 33 The total number of treatments carried out by the Department including domestic, business and factory premises, was 462. During the year the Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Investigating Staff made altogether 4,415 visits concerning rat infestation. The Council provides this service to the occupiers of all dwellinghouses free of charge. Industrial and business premises are dealt with at the request of the proprietors who pay the full cost of any disinfestation undertaken at their premises. INFESTATION WITH INSECTS, ETC.

There are four premises in Enfield which are registered under this Act. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. 37 It also deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. The Act does not apply to noise or vibration caused by aircraft nor to noise or vibration caused by statutory undertakers in the exercise of their powers. Several investigations regarding complaints of noise were carried out during the year. CARAVAN SITES AND CONTROL OF DEVELOPMENT ACT, 1960 This Act makes provision for the licensing and control of caravan sites, and authorises local authorities to provide and operate caravan sites. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has also issued Model Standards under section 5 of the Act. Reference to the control of caravans is made in the preamble to this Report. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act controls the keeping of pet shops. During the course of the year five premises previously licensed by the local authority were re-licensed. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 1961. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) REGULATIONS, 1953. THE OIL HEATERS REGULATIONS, 1962. Under Section One of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, the Secretary of State may by regulation, impose safety requirements respecting any prescribed class of goods or component parts, and also secure that such goods or component parts are in a prescribed manner, marked with, or accompanied by, any warning or instructions which are considered expedient. Section Two of the Act, prohibits the sale of goods not complying with regulations made under Section One. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952, was repealed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, but Regulations made under the former Act in 1953, remain effective as if made under Section One of the Consumer Protection Act, 1961. These Regulations require fireguards to be fitted to gas fires, electric fires and oil heaters of types so designed that they are suitable for domestic use, and so constructed, that without a guard there is likelihood of injury by burning, or of ignition of clothing by reason of contact with, or proximity to the heating element or flame. The Oil Burners (Standards) Act, 1960, was also repealed by the Consumer Protection Act, 1961, but under the latter Act, the Oil 38 Heaters Regulations 1962, came into operation on 1st June, 1962, and imposed certain requirements regarding oil heaters with a view to preventing, or reducing, risk of death or personal injury. The Regulations relate to warning notices to be borne by heaters; their construction, design and performance generally; tests of risk of fire to walls and floors and for test of resistance to draughts. Provision is also made for tests of goods purchased for the purpose by a local authority, to be carried out at the expense of the local authority by any such person or body as may be authorised by the Secretary of State. LICENSING ACT, 1961. Under this new legislation, any applications to the licensing justices for licences to retail intoxicating liquor, are first referred to the Borough Council for opinion as to the general suitability including satisfactory siting of the premises, the provision of adequate sanitary accommodation, and compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations. Forty-one applications were referred during the year which necessitated eighty-seven visits being made to premises by the Public Health Inspectors. FACTORIES ACT, 1961 A register is kept of all the factories in the Borough, and during the year 158 inspections were carried out. 1.—INSPECTIONS for purposes of provisions as to health (including inspections made by Public Health Inspectors).

Byelaws were made in 1937 for the purpose of securing the cleanliness of any premises used for carrying on the business of a hairdresser or barber and of the instruments, towels, and materials used in such premises. These byelaws have proved useful in maintaining a high standard in the premises of the Borough. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Number of inspections of sanitary accommodation .. 133 OFFENSIVE TRADES. Byelaws with respect to the regulation of an offensive trade of a dealer in butchers' waste were sealed by the Council on 3rd December, 1962. When the Statutory Advertisements have been published the Byelaws will be submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 In 1959, local authorities submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government dates by which they expected that their areas could be completely smoke controlled, and also outlined their programmes for the five year period 1959-1963. As some authorities found that they could complete their programmes in advance of the dates given, and others were unable to keep to their scheduled programme, the Minister considered that it was time for a general review of the position. Authorities were, therefore, requested to re-examine their programmes with a view to expediting completion, bearing in mind the time likely to be saved by the recently introduced simplified method of making smoke control areas. The Council, accordingly, revised the programme formulated in 1959 in which the target year for completion was 1974, and gave approval to a new programme of approximately 3,000 houses being dealt with each year for the five year period 1962-66, the target year for completion of the whole Borough being 1972. 41 With the modification that the Order would become operative on the 8th December, 1962, the Minister confirmed the Enfield Smoke Control Order No. 3 on 30th June, 1962, thus giving householders ample time to comply with the provisions of the Order. With the completion of this third area, a total of 5,364 dwellings, etc., and 1,197 acres, had been included in Smoke Control Areas. In accordance with the new programme, No. 4 area has been extended, and details of this area were submitted to the Minister in December, 1962. It is hoped that the Order will receive confirmation early in the new year. Area No. 4 will incorporate 3,046 dwellings, etc., and an acreage of 6,690. National Survey of Pollution. Estimations of daily smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations were commenced in January, 1962, at four sites in the Borough, in connection with the National Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution. The instruments are sited in accordance with the recommendations of the Working Party set up by the Co-operating Bodies in the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution. Station 1.

The month of December included a period of fog which developed during the evening of Monday, 3rd December and became denser on Tuesday, 4th December. Conditions improved slightly on Wednesday, 5th December, but fog persisted quite densely until mid-day on Friday, 7th December. It will be remembered that ten years previously, from 4th - 9th December, 1952, a similar dense foggy period was experienced. For comparison with the average daily amounts of smoke and sulphur dioxide recorded in tables A and B, the daily figures for this foggy period, December 3rd - 7th, 1962, are given in tables C and D : C.

Although this concentration of smoke was not reached during the period under review, the concentration of sulphur dioxide was well above the stated figure. The information derived from these first year figures, is, of course, of limited value, but they will, together with the trends in the smoke/sulphur dioxide ratio, (which figures are given in tables E, F and G below) give, in due course, valuable information in relation to the progress made in Smoke Control Areas : E.

As regards the purification of the water, the up-to-date method of chlorination, filtration and aeration is used at both premises. This gives a safe and pleasant bathing water. Reports on the twice-daily examinations for chlorine and alkalinity of the water are sent to the Medical Officer of Health, and the Public Health Inspectors take samples for bacteriological tests at appropriate intervals. At both the open-air pool and the indoor bath, slipper bath facilities are available. PUBLIC MORTUARY There is now no public mortuary in Enfield, but use is made at present of a Hospital Mortuary.
