Gentlemen, The General Mortality. 1. The health of London during the year 1870 did not deviate much from its average rate, notwithstanding the prevalence of two severe epidemic diseases. The Registrar General states, in his Annual Summary, that "the mean rate of mortality for 31 years is 24.34, and the mortality in 1870 is a little below this; it is 24.12." The birth-rate was 35.3 to 1000 living. 2. The year 1870 may be regarded as an epidemical year, two of the most formidable of the spreading diseases having been particularly fatal. Scarlet fever carried off more victims (5998) last year than in any year of the previous twelve, and small-pox began to be particularly prevalent in tho last quarter. Tho other catching diseases, however, manifested no especial activity; so that the aggregate number of this order was not in excess of the previous year. Hence we notice the peculiarity of a year not generally unhealthy, although characterised by a high mortality in certain forms of epidemic disease. 3. The birth-rate for St. Giles District for 1870 was 31.2 to 1000 living, and death-rate 27.3, so that our birth-rate was as much below the Metropolitan birth-rate, as our death-rate was above the Metropolitan death-rate. The Birth-rate in St. Giles District. 4. The registered number of births for St. Giles District during the year 1870 was 1828. This number must, however, be corrected after the manner adopted last year. There were 167 children born (excluding eight stillbirths) in the Lying-in Hospital in Endell Street, of whom only 26 belonged to our District, as ascertained from the previous residences of the mothers ; 141 births must be, therefore, subtracted from the registered number, leaving us only 1687. Again, of the entire number of births 764 were registered for St. Giles South, in which sub-district the Hospital lies; the 141 births in the Hospital must, consequently, be deducted from the registered birth-rate of that sub-district, which gives us 623. 5. Further, the births in the Workhouse were 103, all of which arc registered against St. Giles South, but a proper distribution being made according to the previous residences of the mothers, we find that 12 belong to Bloomsbury, 27 to St. Giles North, and 62 to St. Giles South: two others having come from outside parishes. Excluding these two our exact number of births was 1685. 6. These corrections having been made the following Table expresses the exact birth-rate to population. 3 TABLE No. I.—The Birth-rate to Population in St. Giles and its Sub-districts. Districts.

The registered death-rate must be treated in the same way as the registered birth-rate, by adding to it the deaths in hospitals, and by distributing among the three sub-districts the deaths of persons in the Workhouse (254) in accordance with their ascertained previous residences. The deaths in the Infants' Home (5) must also be deducted from the mortality of the Bloomsbury sub-district. The subjoined Table shows the results: TABLE No. II.—The Death-Rate to Population in St. Giles and its Sub-districts. Districts. Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population. Rate per 1000. St. George Bloomsbury 17,392 384 1 in 45 22.1 St. Giles South 19,483 665 1 in 29 34.1 St. Giles North 17,201 428 1 in 40 24.8 Whole District 54,076 1,477 1 in 38 27.3 8. Last year I pointed out the want of direct relation between the birth-rates and death-rates in St. Giles, in contradiction of a doctrine strenuously maintained by some statisticians; and this year our data furnish a corroboration of the conclusion then formed. Last year in St. Giles South, with a birth-rate of 34.5 per 1000, we had a death-rate of 33.2. This year in the same subdistrict, with a birth-rate so low as 29.8 per 1000, the death-rate is 34.1, varying but little from last year. Again, in St. Giles North the birth-rate last year was 30.8, and the death-rate 29.4; this year the birth-rate being 34.4, or unusually high, the death-rate has descended to 24.8. The relationship is evidently rather one of contrast than affinity. The Death-rate among Infants in St. Giles. 9. The infantile mortality is one of the most interesting subjects connected with the study of vital statistics; for not only does it form the most important element in swelling the aggregate mortality; but it indicates in a characteristic way the particular sanitary evils that infest a district and poison the currents of life at their source. Many of the causes of mortality among persons of mature age arise from inveterate practices which no sanitary officer can be expected to modify in an important degree, and which must be left to the meliorating influences of a higher education and fuller knowledge of the mischiefs that flow from the habitual violation of natural laws. 4 10. Among infants, and especially the offspring of the poor, the case is different. "Whilst their parents are out on business or pleasure, they are usually left at home exposed to the debilitating influences of dirty, close and fetid rooms, foul drains, irregular feeding—or perhaps no food at all—cold and damp, imperfect clothing and the varied consequences of maternal neglect. Hence their tender strength withers early, and the homes of the indigent and careless are unblessed with healthy offspring. 11. The registered number of deaths of infants under one year of age, for the year 1870, was 332. The proportion for each sub-district, after correction made for the deaths in the Workhouse duly referable to each subdistrict, was St. George Bloomsbury 89, St. Giles South 139, St. Giles North 104. 12. The following is the proportion of deaths to births. Whole District 1 death to every 5 Births = 20 per cent. St. George Bloomsbury 1 „ 5.7 ,, = 17.4 ,, St. Giles South 1 ,, 4.1 ,, = 24.2 ,, St. Giles North 1 „ 5.8 „ =17.2 „ 13. The death-rate of infants under one-year compared with the births for the entire District is about the same as last year; but the rate for the several sub-districts materially differs; St. George Bloomsbury and St. Giles South being higher, and St. Giles North being lower. The ordinary infantile death-rate is 15.9 per cent. of children born; and as we see in the Table, all our sub-districts are above it. 14. The infantile mortality in St. Giles South has been very heavy, that sub-district having lost 8.3 per cent. more children in relation to the births than it ought, or more than one half of its share calculated upon the mean mortality of the country. 15. The death-rate among infants in relation to the population is thus expressed: — Whole District 1 death in every 163 population = 6.1 per 1000. St. Geo. Bloomsbury 1 ,, 195.4 ,, =5.1 ,, St. Giles South 1 ,, 140 ,, =7.1 ,, St. Giles North 1 ,, 165.4 ,, =6. ,, The ratio of deaths of infants to Total Deaths in St. Giles District is 23.15 per cent. The ratio of the same for the whole Metropolis being 23.9 per cent. We thus see that our infantile death-rate has been rather less than the Metropolitan. This proportion, however, considerably varies in the three sub-districts: thus, in St. George Bloomsbury it is 23.17 per cent., in St. Giles South 21 per cent., in St. Giles North 24.3 per cent. 16. Some explanation is necessary in order to clear up what appears to be, on the surface, anomalous and contradictory in these several summaries. It may seem strange, for example, while St. George Bloomsbury is represented to have the moderate death-rate among infants in relation to birthrate of 17.4 yer cent., and St. Giles South the comparatively high one of 24.2 per cent., that the death-rate in the same sub-districts in relation to total deaths should be reversed, viz., St. George Bloomsbury 23.17 per cent., St. Giles South 21 per cent. 17. The explanation, however, is that, a large number of children dying in the first year of life in St. Giles South, there is an excess of adults in the aggregate population, added to which there is a population of more than 2000 adult celibates who occupy the common lodging houses in that sub-district. Hence the death-rate of infants to total deaths is relatively very low, whilst the death-rate to births is high. The latter method is the correct one for ascertaining the mortality of infants as determined by insanitary causes; but I have thought it right to show the mortality in both relations, in order that a comparison may be more readily made with other statistics calculated upon the ratio of infant deaths to total deaths. 5 18. There is a further anomaly to be reconciled, viz., the death-rate of infants to population in relation to the death-rate of infants to the total deathrate. This is especially remarkable in Blooms bury, where the death-rate of infants to population is low, whilst the death-rate to total mortality is high. The explanation is to be found, to a large degree, in the fact that Bloomsbury, in great part, consists of well-to-do families who employ servants in the proportion, probably, of one-third of the whole number of inmates. Most of these servants when taken seriously ill, return to their homes, where they die and are registered. They, moreover, rarely have children. Hence it happens that these dependants, being counted in our population, but not as a rule in our registers of mortality, swell the former and reduce the latter. The apparent anomalies, therefore, in our Tables of Infant Mortality, are easily accounted for. The Death-Rate among Persons 60 Years of Age and Upwards. 19. The registered number of persons dying at this period of life is 271 for the entire district, in the proportion of Bloomsbury 80, St. Giles South 143, St. Giles North 48. The deaths in the Workhouse, however, of persons belonging to the two sub-districts of Bloomsbury (8) and St. Giles North (25) with those of others (5) admitted from outside parishes must be subtracted from St. Giles South, and appropriated to their respective sub-districts. This having been done, the figures stand thus: Bloomsbury 88, St. Giles South 105, St. Giles North 73. 20. The following Summary shows the rate of deaths at these ages to population: Whole District 1 death in every 200 population = 5 per 1000. St. George Blooms bury 1 ,, 197.6 ,, = 5.06 ,, St. Giles South 1 ,, 185.5 ,, = 5.39 ,, St. Giles North 1 ,, 235.6 ,, = 4.24 ,, 21. The Death-rate among Persons at all ages (excluding Infants and Persons 60 years of age and upwards): Whole District 1 death in every 62 population = 16.16 per 1000. St. Geo. Bloomsbry. 1 ,, 84 ,, = 11.90 ,, St. Giles South 1 ,, 46 = 21.61 ,, St. Giles North 1 ,, 68 ,, = 14.59 ,, Thus, it is clear, that at the prime of life the death-rate in St. Giles South has been, during 1870, nearly double that of Blooms bury; whilst that for St Giles North has been less than the mean for the District. This Summary also explains why the death-rate for infants in St. Giles South should be relatively low as compared with the total deaths. Two striking facts are made clear by these Summaries, viz., first, the excessive death-rate among infants in relation to births in St. Giles South; and secondly the excessive death-rate among children and persons in the prime of life in the same subdistrict. 22. The following Table exhibits the comparative mortality of St. Giles District in relation to the Metropolis. Our aggregate was 14 per cent. more than its quota; and the particular classes of disease in which we more especially exceeded our proportion were the “Constitutional," “Local," and “Developmental." The Miasmatic Order closely corresponded with its estimated quota, but tubercular diseases and diseases of the lungs were in considerable excess. (See Table on page following.) Small Pox. 23. The most remarkable circumstance during the year has been the prevalence of an epidemic of small pox. At the commencement of the year the mortality was light and variable ; but towards the month of July it became steady at the highest number it had reached during the previous 26 weeks, and in the last quarter the disease raged with much severity, the deaths numbering in the last week of the year 110. I need scarcely add 6 TABLE III. Comparison of Mortality from Various Causes in London and St. Giles, Whole Year, 1870, (52 Weeks.) Classes. Classes and Ord-ers of Disease. London.

The Registrar-General states that an epidemic of small-pox has occurred during the past 30 years about once in every three years, attaining a maximum of severity about once in every five years; that in the 31 years 1840—70 the annual deaths have averaged 808; the lowest number of deaths in any one year having been 154, and the highest 2,012. The number of deaths in 1870 was 958; but of these so many as 584 occurred in the last quarter. 24. The first cases of this epidemic in St. Giles District of which I could get information occurred in two members of one family at No. 27, Crown Street, on February 3rd. The disease, however, does not seem to have spread from them to others. It became localized about a fortnight later in the Colonnade at the other end of the District; and there is evidence to show that it entered our District from St. Paneras. 25. On the 1st February Dr. Stevenson, the Medical Officer of Health of St. Pancras District, kindly wrote to me to inform me of the fact that several cases of small pox had been reported to him bordering upon St. Giles District, viz., at 14, Colonnade 8 cases; 7, Colonnade 2 oases; and at 39, Colonnade others. I instantly instituted inquiries, and was able to assure Dr. Stevenson that, at that time, there were no cases of small pox in that part of the Colonnade which is within St. Giles District. A fortnight afterwards, however, (just the period of the incubation of the disease) on the 15th February our first case was reported at 22, Colonnade, and in the course of the next five months we had 25 cases in the Colonnade and the Little Coram Street section of the District. There seems reason to believe, therefore, that the epidemic approached us through the streets contiguous to St. Paneras. That parish, in its turn, probably received it from its nearest Eastern neighbour; but under what circumstances it became prevalent in the East of London, whether it originated there or was imported, and, if imported, whence, are yet open questions. The determination of these questions is of the utmost importance to the solution of the further question of the possible stamping out of the first sparks of these spreading diseases. Statistical returns have their use in setting forth a certain class of facts and in showing, inferentially, the conditions favourable to the dissemination of epidemic diseases, and they point the way to practical effort; but the way must be followed until we arrive at the source of contagion. To the extent that the spread of a disease like small pox depends upon contagion from person to person—and, I believe, that its propagation is almost wholly, if not altogether, due to this cause,—the seizure and isolation of the first case is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, however, there is no organization equal to the work; and no law adequate to give effect to such organization if it existed. 26. I am unable to state the number of attacks of small pox during the year, as there are no reliable means of obtaining such facts; but the deaths were numerous. Only 5 deaths are recorded in the local Registers; but in addition to these there were 11 that occurred in Hospital, making an aggregate of 16,—just our proportion of the aggregate Metropolitan mortality. In the three previous years, the mortality had been as follows:—in 1867, 31 deaths; in 1868, 6 deaths; in 1869, 1 death. In 1870 the epidemic was gathering strength for its culminating energy in the current year 1871. Some of the persons (at least 5) who died had not been vaccinated,—notably three children at 10, Lumber Court who had come from St. Paneras, and whose father declared to a prejudice against the operation. One child was attacked with small pox two days after vaccination, and died. In this case the vaccination was no protection, the virus not having gone through its regular course in the system; for it is now well understood that unless the process of vaccination is completed by the usual local and constitutional developments the individual is not protected. Vaccination and Re-vaccination. 27. The importance of vaccination cannot be doubted both in preventing attacks and in modifying them when 8 they occur. There is reason to believe, however, that the system, in the course of time, loses some of the protective influence of the original vaccination; and my own experience of more than 200 re-vaccinations of persons whose ages ranged from 21 to 60 years, during the present epidemic, has convinced me that the belief is well founded. The finest pocks—pocks, in some instances, similar in every respect, form, development, areola, to an infantine vaccination—I have noticed in persons over fifty years of age. If susceptibility to the action of the vaccine lymph be an evidence of tho susceptibility to small-pox, re-vaccination is a necessity, and should be systematically practised soon after puberty, and once, at least, in later life. Vaccination in St. Giles. 28. Although the practice of vaccination is said to have been neglected in some districts of London, I am pleased to be able to state that in St. Giles it has been carried out by the Public Vaccinator with much vigour and efficiency. The Parochial Authorities have appointed a Committee to supervise the work and an Officer to inspect the infants born in the conjoint parishes, to ascertain the fact of their vaccination, and to put the law in force against negligent parents. The result was that, during the year included between October, 1869, and September, 1870, 496 children were vaccinated in the first instance out of 1688 children born; the operation having been neglected in the large number of 1192. It is now that the importance of the duty performed by the Inspector of Vaccination is seen. He calls upon the parents or gives a formal notice requiring tho infants to be vaccinated, and it appears that, after these measures had been taken, 770 children were vaccinated; so that of all the children born 1266 were protected, and 422 were omitted. 29. The deaths of children under one year in the same period were 332. Some of these would have been previously vaccinated; but the large majority in all probability, would not, having died too early, or having been too delicate and feeble for the operation. Subtracting this number from the 422 it gives us about 100 children who are unaccounted for. It is probable that the parents of many of these children moved out of the District; but provision is made, even for such an event; for, as I am informed, whenever the address of the parents so removing can be ascertained, it is usual to send a letter to the authorities of the parish into which the parents have removed to inform them of the fact, in order that the children may not escape vaccination. Thus we have a system of vaccination established in this District which is most creditable to the Authorities and unusually successful in its results. The success would be greater if all other Parishes carried out the same plan. TABLE No. IV.—Showing the number op Cases of Small Pox in each Quarter of the Year 1870, with the Deaths.

The foregoing Table shows that the largest number of attacks occurred in Bloomsbury, owing, no doubt, to its proximity to the source of infection, and in the second quarter of the year. It is remarkable that there was a disproportionate mortality among males. 9 Measles. 31. The mortality (231) from this disease has been about the average of preceding years. There was only 1 death in the last quarter of the year, and only 2 in the first; the third or autumnal quarter was the most fatal. Scarlet Fever. 32. Our sanitary condition in respect of this disease has not been so favourable this year as it was last. This year the deaths have amounted to 103; last year they were only 48. Nevertheless we have had only three more than our proportion (100) of the general mortality of London. Whooping Cough. 33. Whooping cough has visited us lightly. Our number (16) is just half of our quota (32). All the deaths from this disease fell in the first and second quarters of the year. Fevers. 34. The death-number (31) from tho diseases included in this term, viz., typhus, enteric and simple continued fever, was much smaller than last year, and smaller also than our proportion (35) of tho Metropolitan aggregate. Diarrhosa. 35. Our tribute to the general mortality from diarrhoea shonld have been only 63; we actually rendered a death number of 83. This disease is usually severe among us, on account of the excessive mortality among children in the unwholesome houses of the poorer districts during summer and autumn. Deaths from Violence. 36. St. Giles is not peculiarly fertile in this class of deaths. We have had 38, our proportion being 44. Other districts of London, where great manufacturing works are carried on, or where docks and shipping abound, produce a larger mortality from the various causes ranged under this head. Inquest Cases. 37. The number of inquests held in St. Giles district during the year 1870, was 96, and about half of these were derived from St. Giles South. Excluding those deaths which were found to be attributable to ordinary disease, violence, or accident, there were 12 which were caused by suffocation in led, 1 by suffocation in the mother's arms, 1 suffocation by neglect, 1 wilful murder by suffocation, 1 drowned in urine; four others were said to have died of convulsions. Here are, at least, 16 deaths of infants, which are directly traceable, either to the culpable neglect or murderous intent of their mothers or nurses. 38. Besides the foregoing, there were 17 deaths registered without certificate; yet, in these cases, inquests were not held. Eour of these had been attended by the medical officers of the Children's Hospital, and in some instances, a statement had been made by them of the malady under which the child had been suffering whilst under their treatment. 39. There were also 5 deaths in which a certificate of the cause of death had been written “Unknown" ; yet, these cases too were registered. A death of a woman 70 years of age, was attributed to a “Flaw in the Chest," whatever that may mean, — I know not. If mis-written for “blow in the chest," theu an inquest was imperative. 40. The following table represents the “Registered" mortality in each quarter, in the three sub-districts, from zymotic diseases and from violence; also inquest cases, and deaths in public institutions. (See Table V. next page.) 41. The whole number of zymotic diseases that occurred in St. Giles in 1870, was 329, as may be seen in the Appendix; our population being 334. The diseases which exceeded their ratio, were scarlet fever and diarrhoea.; the former in a trifling degree, the latter more remarkably. Besides the 5 deaths recorded above from small pox, there were 11 more that occurred in hospitals, as already explained (§ 26). See next page Table VI. 42. Tho death-rate for 1870, was below the average death-rate of the ten preceding years. This was mainly due to the remarkably small rate for St. Giles North; St. George Bloomsbury, having exceeded its rate in any 10 previous year, and St. Giles South, having approached very nearly to its maximum. It is difficult to understand these apparent caprices; for we have no reason to believe that the sanitary condition of St. Giles North, is very much better than in preceding years; although that of St. George Bloomsbury is, I am afraid, getting worse in consequence of the gradual deterioration of its population in some of its out.lving districts.

Rouse Register of Deaths from Zymotic, Tuberculous, and Pulmonary Diseases. 43. The excessive mortality from diseases of the lungs in St. Giles district prompted me to ascertain, if possible, whether there might be some local cause for it in the construction or ventilation of houses in certain situations, or in any other insanitary condition apart from the occupations and habits of the people. In order to get at this knowledge, it was necessary, in the first instance, to follow up each death to the house in which it happened. Ultimately, I determined to make the same investigation for three 11 classes of disease, viz: The zymotic, the tuberculous, and the pulmonary. The House Register, in the appendix, gives the results of that enquiry. One year's experience is not sufficient to justify any conclusion on the points I had in view; but the Register is, nevertheless, full of interest. The three classes of disease named, represent about one half of the entire mortality of the district, exclusive of the workhouse; and two of them, the zymotic and the tuberculous, are especially, induced by foul air, filth, and other noxious domestic conditions. 44. In order to obtain a succinct representation of the death-rate from those diseases in various streets and courts, I have constructed another table, No. 7, in which can be seen at a glance, the comparative mortality in a ratio to houses in the streets included, beginning with Queen Street, St. Giles South, where the ratio was highest, and ending with Woburn Square, Bloomsbury, where it was lowest. It must be understood, however, that the ratio of deaths to houses, bears no definite relation to the death-rate to population, on account of the varying size and population of different houses, and of the circumstances already referred to in § 18. The facts have, nevertheless, considerable value in a sanitary point of view. TABLE No. VII.—Rate of Mortality to Houses in certain Streets, from Zymotic, Tubercular, and Pulmonary Diseases. Streets.

Woburn Square 41 1 1 in 41.? 45. On referring to the table No. 7, it will be seen that the death-rate has ranged from 1 in 1.08 houses in Queen Street, to 1 in 41 in Woburn Square. This seems almost incredible, yet it is the simple fact as proved by the public registers. Further, if various local diseases, as of the heart, kidneys, liver, most of which are either induced, or are hastened to a fatal termination, by intemperance, and the multifarious other forms of local maladies, had been included, there is sufficient reason to believe that the mortality of Queen Street, George Street, Chapel Place, &c. would have been twice greater than is represented in the table. 12 The Sanitary Characteristics of Chapel Place, &c. 46. With the view of shewing some of the bearings of the facts comprised in these tables, I will cite the sanitary characteristics of a few of the most remarkable streets. Chapel Street is situated at the extreme North end of the parish of St. George Bloomsbury, and is composed of 24 houses. These houses have back-yards of fair size, and the domestic appurtenances are, mostly, iu good condition, so that it would be vain to seek here for the cause of the excessive mortality. The front court is narrow, and ends in a cul de sac; it is thus deprived of ventilation. The chief fault, however, is in the houses themselves, which generally consist of two storeys, with an underground cellar. The rooms are very small; the front room on the ground floor of No. 3 (quoted as an example), yielding only 647 cubic feet of space, and the back room only 443 cubic feet, so that if the two rooms were occupied by one family, and both used as sleeping rooms, they could properly accommodate, at the most, only two adults and one child. Houses, having rooms affording such inadequate accommodation are quite unfit, as lodging-houses, for the occupation of several families. Inspector Webb has made for me a census of the population in this place, and he has returned a population of 244 persons, or rather more than 10 persons to each house. The deaths from the three classes of disease in Chapel Place having been 17, the death-rate to population was in 1870, 70 per 1,000 persons. What the entire mortality would have been, had it been calculated, I have already indicated. A new sewer was made in the court, at the end of the year 1869, yet the death-rate does not appear to have been reduced. 47. What can be done with courts like this ? They are certainly unfit for human habitation; but how remove them ? The popular mind is not sufficiently enlightened on sanitary subjects, to enable us to deal with these difficulties in a way the public health demands, and if there were a disposition to do it, there are no authorities to carry out the work who are endowed with sufficient powers that can be applied with ready certainty. Trifling changes will not meet the exigency, and large ones cannot be made. I have given instructions for checking such overcrowding, as may be outside the legal limit, but this is only a temporary expedient; and moreover, the legal limitation is much within the amount of cubic space, necessary for the healthy working of a human lung. 48. In Queen Street, consisting of 25 houses, there is a population, as ascertained by Inspector Dixon, of 513 persons, at the rate of 20.5 persons to a house. Of these 513 persons, 195 occupy common lodging-houses. The death-rate, from the three classes of disease, is 1 in 1.08 houses, and 44.8 per 1,000 of population. This street is in the centre of St. Giles Parish, and contains several common lodging-houses, in which the larger portion of the mortality occurred. One of these houses for men, has about 100 lodgers, and the only day accommodation provided for them is two kitchens, or more properly, cellars of small size, and fitted up with separate compartments. These cellars are used for cooking, taking meals, and lounging during the day, and they are altogether unsuited and absurdly inadequate for these purposes. This insufficient kitchen accommodation is a fault in all common lodginghouses. The cubicles are also deficient of space; hence, disease and premature death are easily accounted for. 49. We will now take another example of a high mortality in the group of streets and courts bounded by Great Wild Street, Wild Court, Chapel Yard, and Duke Street, in the parish of St. Giles. Inspector Dixon reports to me a population in this section of 1,532 persons, who occupy 76 houses, being at the rate of about 20 persons to each house. The deaths from the three classes of disease were 41, which give a rate of 26.7 per 1,000 persons. The mortality, however, differs very much in different courts of the section. The average spacc is 400 cubic feet for each person. 13 50. In New Compton Street, with a population of 1,250 in 74 houses' equal to 17 persons in each house, the deaths were 33, yielding a death-rate from these diseases of 26.4 per 1,000. 51. In Dudley Street, with a population of 1,456 in 89 houses, equal to 10 persons to each house, the deaths were 30, yielding a death-rate from these diseases of 20.6 per 1,000. 52. In each of these instances the death-rate would have been largely increased had the whole mortality been included. Computed, however, upon the basis of the three special classes of disease above, their average mortality has been equal to the average death-rate of the metropolis from all orders diseases whatsoever. The comparative prevalence, locally, of Zymotic and Pulmonary Diseases. 53. Some remarks may be appropriately made on the local prevalence of one or other of the classes of disease included in the " Register," so far as a single year affords evidence. Taking two classes of disease, the zymotic and the pulmonary, including in the latter, phthisis for our present purpose, we find that zymotic diseases were the least prevelent, and pulmonary diseases the most prevalent among the lowest class of our population, whilst the proportions were reversed in the case of a better class of working people. The lowest class of our population are, of course, adult tramps, who frequent Queen Street, Charles Street, Short's Gardens, &c., and a large number of Irish families who inhabit Great Wild Street and its neighbouring courts, Church Lane, &c., and who may be said to live in the streets rather than in their houses. The better class are usually English artizans, occupying one or two rooms, and whose families live more indoors than the Irish. Lung diseases, it appears, have prevailed most among those who have been most exposed to vicissitudes of weather, whilst zymotic diseases have chiefly attacked families where the children have been kept at home in ill-ventilated rooms. There is a mixed class of English and of Irish families of more settled habits, among whom the mortality has been more equally divided between the two forms of disease. Dividing the localities into three sections, viz :—1st. When the death from pulmonary diseases were double those from the zymotic class; 2nd. When they were less than double ; and 3rd, when the deaths from zymotic diseases exceeded those from the pulmonary, we get the following results :— TABLE No. VIII.—Comparative prevalence op Zymotic and Diseases in certain Streets. Pulmonary Sections. Localities. Deaths from Zymotic Diseases. Deaths from Pulmonary Discs. 1st Lincoln Court 1 7 Short' Gardens 2 11 Tower Streat 3 12 Chapel Place 4 13 King Street (Drury Lane) 5 IB Church Lane 6 10 Queen Street 6 1g Great Wild Streat 8 19 2nd Drury Lane 6 10 Dudley Street 9 17 New Compton Street 14 14 3rd Lascelles Place 4 3 Brownlow Street 4 3 Castle Street 4 3 Museum Street 7 2 Little Russell Street 5 1 High Holborn 6 1 14 Drury Lane and Dudley Street are allied to the 1st section, whilst New Compton Street approaches the 2nd. Any one familiar with our population will readily recognise the distinctions I have made. Zymotic diseases were not, perhaps, actually fewer in the 1st section than in the 3rd; hut pulmonary diseases were, undoubtedly, much more numerous, and it is to these that our excess of mortality is mainly due. The Rate of Mortality in the "Society's" Lodging-houses. 54. I have been favoured by Mr. Payne, the Secretary to tho Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes, with a tabular statement of the mortality in the several buildings under his superintendance, and as it is of considerable importance in illustrating the present subject, I re-produce it here, so far as it refers to St. Giles district. 55. A few corrections are required in the foregoing Table. There were, for example, 4 deaths in the “Workhouse (3 adults and 1 child) of persons who had previously lived in Wild Court, which gives an aggregate of 7 deaths of adults and 6 of children; total 13. One adult also died in the Workhouse who should be returned for Clark's Buildings, making 3 adults and 2 children ; total 5. 56. An analysis of this Table shows that there is a great difference in the death-rate in the several buildings. In the Model House in Streatham Street, with a population of 217, there has been but one death in the year, or a rate of 4.6 per 1,000; but in Wild Court, with a population of 356, there have been 13 deaths either occurring in it, or referable to it, or a rate of 36.5 per 1,000, whilst in Clark's Biddings, with a population of 263, there have been 5 deaths, or a rate of 18.2 per 1,000. 57. Now, the Streatham Street block was erected expressly as a Model House, and is inhabited by a sober and orderly class of people, and we see the advantage of these circumstances in a standard of health fulness extraordinarily high. In Clark's Buildings, which are occupied by respectable working people, composed of English and Irish in about equal proportions, the mortality was much lower than the average mortality of London, and about equal to the healthiest rural districts. These buildings are in a close neighbourhood, and are adaptations of old houses of a better sort than usual, and they are provided with the necessary appurtenances for health and cleanliness. They are kept fairly clean, and we witness accordingly, a satisfactory result. 58. So favourable an opinion cannot be expressed of Wild Court. The causes are obvious upon inspection. The houses were too old for successful TABLE No. IX.—Returns of Model Dwellings, for the Yeah ending December 31st, 1870. Establishments. Where situate. Number of Families. Average Population.

The waterclosets are often without water;—on a recent inspection, I found all the closets in one house (No. 12) without water supply, and they had been so, I was informed, for a considerable time; other closets in other houses were in the same condition. The walls and ceilings are generally dirty, and many of them damp from leakage, either through the roof or from the cisterns. The drainage too, is imperfect; the main drain up the court being only one foot in diameter, to carry the sewage of about 500 persons, it consequenty often gets stopped. Finally, the court stands in the centre of the most squalid and unwholesome part of St. Giles. Many of these insanitary conditions clearly arise from neglect, but I am satisfied that the bad structural state of the property, and the noxious surroundings, will always counteract the advantages to be expected from the Society's philanthropic efforts. 59. Notwithstanding these remarks on the state of this particular court, I am bound to express my opinion that the Society deserves great praise for its work in this district; it has been the pioneer of improvements, which, in the course of time, must become general, and it has shown us by its experimental efforts, what to adopt and what to avoid. Its experience proves the importance of reconstructing buildings, from their foundations, upon entirely new plans, in which all the requisite sanitary arrangements are provided. Certain Defects in Sanitary Legislation. 60. The experience I have had in applying the sanitary laws, has convinced me that our health administration will remain very imperfect until larger measures of improvement shall be sanctioned by Parliament. The Legislature has, it its true, authorised our interferance with many noxious tiades, and with most social arrangements, that can be regarded as "nuisances," or as "injurious to health"; but these interpositions in matters of detail are, for the most part, only palliative, and, what is required, is a more comprehensive dealing with fundamental evils. In addition to this, the duty of making these improvements should be imperative, instead of permissive. It was wise, at first, perhaps that our sanitary legislation should be tentative and experimental; but experience having proved its necessity, it should be made more stringent. Lodging-houses. 61. The chief want of the poor in this District is, as I have already stated, suitable and healthy dwellings. With the exception of the Model Lodging Houses that have been established in St. Giles parish, there are few houses so constructed as to be adapted to the sanitary requirements of several families living under one roof. Most of the houses were erected for occupation by separate families; in the course of time, however, a single family has taken possession of every separate room, the accommodations, consequently, which were intended for one family, are made to do duty for eight or ten. It may be said, that the law gives us power to increase these conveniences. This is to a considerable extent, a fallacy; for, in the first place, we cannot give additional accommodation where there is no room for it; and in the second place, if there should be space, the law is, in some important respects, so indefinite and cumbrous that it is inoperative. Partial adaptations, moreover, of old, disease-infected houses, standing for many decades of years upon soil saturated with the leakage of old cesspools, with the debris of vermin and other kinds of filth, fulfil, in a very imperfect degree, the objects of the sanitary reformer. 62 I conclude, therefore, that nothing effectual can be done for the permanent improvement of the houses of the industrial classes, in the absence of a power to enable a Sanitary Board to take property compulsorily for this purpose. C l 16 The Lodging-house Act, 1851. 63. The labouring classes "Lodging-house Act, 1851," has failed, partly because its powers were confined to parishes which were generally too small to incur the great expenditure involved, and partly because it required that the authorities shall contract for the purchase of property necessary for the purposes of the Act. The difficulties in the way of coming to an agreement with the various persons who may be interested in the property of even a single house, are enough to deter Local Boards from embarking in such an enterprise; but when these difficulties are multiplied by the number of houses necessary to be taken, in order to carry out any large improvement, it is obvious that they become practically insuperable. The Artizans' and Labours' Dwellings Act, 1868. 64. The "Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868," (Torrens' Act), has had but little success on account of its complication, and also, because the intention of the Act being that houses might be demolished on sanitary grounds, the authority of the sanitary officer is simply inchoate, and is arrested after the grant of his certificate. This defect might be corrected, by enabling the local authorities to transmit the certificate of the medical officer to the Privy Council, Home Office, or other superior Board, who should be empowered to send one or more medical referees, with a surveyor, to examine the premises. The conjoint certificate of these officers should be final. 65. Strengthen this Act, however, as we may, it is vain to expect that our worst districts (the neighbourhoods of Wild Street, Short's Gardens, Little Coram Street, for example) can ever be improved so that the sickness and mortality shall be abated in an important degree, by dealing with separate houses. Whole blocks must be demolished, large spaces cleared, the old soil removed, and new dwellings adapted for the habitation of numerous families built upon the sites. This is a great task, but it will have to be done, and the time perhaps is not distant. When railway companies are empowered to seize property to enable them to accomplish schemes which may prove to be, by their results, both unnecessary and unprofitable, it seems a strange anomaly, that no public board should be charged with similar power for a purpose manifestly good and humane—a purpose that would improve the health and morality, and enhance the industrial energies of the large mass of our population. 66. That houses, erected on a large scale, for occupation by working men, might render a fair return for the capital expended, has been proved by the experience of the Corporation of London, and the Company presided over by Alderman Waterlow. A Sanitary Board would probably enjoy the advantage of advances made to it out of the Consolidated Fund as provided for, in a similar case, in the "Lodging-houses Act, 1851." 67. I will now direct your attention to certain defects in the various Acts of Parliament, which your Board is empowered to administer. Water Supply. In considering this subject, I shall confine myself to its bearings on the health and comfort of the working classes. The supply is at present intermittent, which necessitates the use of cisterns for the preservation of the water. These cisterns are constantly getting out of order. They are frequently without covers, and when covers are provided at the instance of the inspectors, they are rarely made to fit close, and are soon lost. The cisterns often leak, the ball-cocks and taps get loose or are broken, and permit leakage or overflow. Hence, the water is, not uncommonly, dirty and unwholesome ; or the cistern is left empty for many days together, the inhabitants meanwhile, helping themselves from the nearest pump, or from their neighbour's tank. A Constant Supply at High-Pressure. 68. These evils would be corrected by the Parliamentary requirement of a constant supply at highpressure. This would do away with cisterns and their attendant 17 veniences. Were public Boards empowered to insist upon a constant supply the risk of waste might be obviated by the use of waste-water preventers As it is, we see the evils and deplore them, but have little power to prevent them. Were the improvements indicated carried out, they would enable us to abolish the manifest and most penicious evil of making a single cistern supply water both for domestic and sewage use. It would be also possible to supply water to every storey of a lodging-house. I do not notice any deficiency in the quality of the water supplied to this district; but there is good reason to believe that if the "constant" system were adopted, there would be less water consumed than under present arrangements. The Registrar-General has informed us that London is the only great City in England that has an intermittent supply. Objections to the Power of Cutting-off the Water Supply. The power now given to companies to cut-off the supply of water should not be permitted. Water is one of the first necessaries of life, and it would be as reasonable to permit a company, who made a pretension of disinfecting the atmosphere, to cut-off our supply of air, as to allow the practice in the case of water. The companies should resort to other means of redress for any violation of their regulations. The Water-closet System. 69. Again, the present water-closet system is not adapted to the requirements of the class who dwell in the worst parts of Saint Giles. These closets are a source of infinite trouble to all parties concerned. Cocks will not work, pipes are cut away, seats get broken, and as the top of the closet is usually regarded as the most convenient place for the cistern, and as the cistern is often not water-tight, a leakage goes on which keeps the seat constantly "wet." As it is a rare thing for the water apparatus to be in good working order, the pans cannot be flushed by a turn of the tap, but must be cleansed otherwise, after getting stopped, and then flushed by throwing down water. This process, of course, drenches the seat, which, in winter, never dries, and is therefore rendered unfit for use. From this point the trouble begins again. Trough Closets. 70. Powers should be given by the Legislature enabling a Local Board to require the substitution of Trough Closets, which would require flushing not more than twice a day—a duty that should be done by a properly appointed agent. The ordinary trough closet is susceptible of improvements, which it is unnecessary, now, to indicate. Mr. Corbie's Case. 71. As an example of the imperfection of the present law, I may instance the fact, that Mr. Corbie was summoned before the Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court, to put the water-closet of one of his houses in proper repair; the defect being that there was no pipe connecting the closet with the water-butt, and the closet was consequently left without water. Mr. Cooke declined to make the order, on the ground that he had no power; for although the 13th Clause of the "Nuisances' Removal and Diseases Prevention Act, 1855," under which the summons was taken out, empowers Justices to require the person on whom the order is made, to provide "sufficient privy accommodation,'' "means of drainage," "to drain, empty, cleanse, fill-up, amend or remove," any privy or urinal which is a nuisance or injurious to health, or " o provide a substitute for that complained of," or "to do such other works or acts as are necessary to abate the nuisance," &c., &c., it does not appear that these terms are sufficiently precise to justify the Magistrate in requiring that a pipe should be attached to a water-closet, in order that it might be "amended" so as to be provided with proper "means of drainage." There was the pan and the drain, but the apparatus could not be worked without water; yet, the only resource was to make an order upon the defendant to cleanse the closet; a process to be followed by the evils I have already described. c2 18 72. The Metropolis Local Management Act, sect. 83, gives you the power to take a refractory defendant before a magistrate, for neglect of your Board's order, "to make or provide a water supply apparatus or other connected works," and the Magistrate has no option but to inflict a penalty. Difficulties may arise, I understand, even in the working of this Act. The simple fact, however, that the Act especially intended to give authority in the case upon sanitary grounds, is so defective, shows the necessity of improved legislation. The Power of Removal of Sick Persons to a Hospital. 73. By the 37th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, your Board is empowered to build a Local Hospital, or to contract for the temporary use of any place for the reception of the sick. It is to he regretted, however, that the 26th section of the same Act, which provides for the removal of such sick persons to the Hospital, makes it necessary to obtain the order of a Justice, who can give it only on the condition that the sick person is without proper lodging or accommodation, or lodged in a room occupied by more than one family." The latter part of this clause is too restricted, as it might be held to determine the sense in which the words "proper lodging or accommodation" should be understood. In that case, the clause would not work in this district, without the concurrence of the patients or their friends. Hitherto, we have had no necessity to attempt the enforcement of the Act. It is expedient that the phraseology employed in the next following clause of the same Act, with reference to the removal of dead bodies, should be employed in this clause also, viz: If the person suffering from 'infectious disease be retained in a "room " in which persons "live or sleep," or if he be lodged in a house, occupied by more than one family, and in which isolation from the healthy cannot be secured. The clause so amended, would not reach decent households; but it would give a more salutary control over ordinary lodginghouses.* Notice to be given of Zymotic Diseases in Families and Schools, fyc. 74. Power also is wanted to require parents and friends to give notice of the occurrence of zymotic diseases in their families, and to make it compulsory on the heads of schools, to report the absence of scholars on account of contagious disease, so that the necessary steps might be taken to prevent its dissemination. In the event of the recovery of the pupils, they should not be received into the school without a certificate of fitness from a medical practitioner. The same rule should be observed in the case of workmen engaged in workshops and factories. 75. It is also important that the managers of all schools should be empowered by law, to prohibit the entrance of any unvaccinated pupils into their schools, and that they should be required to give notice to the Public Yaccinator or other sanitary authority, of such unvaccinated person. The provision for re-vaccination, under the 8th clause of the "Vaccination 'Act, 1867," at certain ages and under certain specified conditions, should be made more imperative, as experience has amply shown its necessity. The Removal of the Dead. 76. The 27th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, relating to the removal of dead bodies, also requires simplification and *Since the above paragraph was written, an application has been made to Sir Thomas Henry, at Bow Street Police Office, for his order to remove a person suffering from small pox to Hospital, such person living at the time with his wife in one room at 22, Princes Street, Drury Lane, in which house three other cases of small pox had occurred. Two of the sufferers had died. Sir Thomas Henry declined to make the order, on the ground stated above, that the clause did not give him the power under the circumstances of the case. A second application has been made to Mr. Vaughan, to order the removal of a man who was suffering from small pox in Kennedy Court, and who was lying in a room which served as a passage to another room where four men slept; but Mr. Vaughan considered that as the second room might be kept closed, and thus fenced off from the sick man, he had no power to interfere. It thus appears that the law does not confer on the Magistrate any power of removal, in case of persons lying sick in ordinary lodging-houses. 19 a clearer definition of authority. In this case, power should he given to remove all bodies of persons dying of infectious disease to a mortuary, and also all other bodies in such a state as to endanger the health of persons living in the house in which the body was retained. The costs of removal and burial (if needed) should not be divided between the nuisance and parochial authorities, as now directed; but should be borne by one of the two. There are many other clauses in the various Sanitary Acts that require improvement; but at present, I confine myself to those that have been especially pressed upon my consideration during the past year. A District Hospital. 77. This matter leads me to the consideration of a most important subject, that has several times occupied the attention of your Board during the past year, viz.: the establishment of a District Hospital. During the prevalence of relapsing fever, our cases received prompt accommodation at the London Fever Hospital, so that there was no necessity for the erection of a local hospital for our especial use. At the close of last session, Parliament enacted that "every Hospital or place for the reception of the sick, situated within the limits of the Metropolis, as defined by the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, shall be deemed to be within the district of every one of the Nuisance Authorities within the Metropolis," the restriction therefore, which, under "The Sanitary Act, 1866," limited the Magistrate's power of removal of a sick person to a hospital situate within the district, was abolished, and every hospital, whose managers might be willing to receive a patient became, practically, a district hospital. 78. Soon afterwards, the newly constituted Metropolitan Asylums Board commenced the establishment of their various hospitals ; the work went rapidly forward, and as the hospitals were opened, we availed ourselves freely (through the prompt instrumentality of the Board of Guardians) of the accommodation they afforded. There have been, consequently, very few cases of zymotic disease that we could have removed to a local hospital, which have not been provided for. I must confess, however, that I have felt much anxiety, on many occasions, lest the accommodation might fail us, and our cases might be left in the midst of our teeming population—to become foci of fresh poisoning and increased mortality. Had the small pox epidemic been as severe in St. Giles as in some of the northern, eastern, and southern districts, our situation would have been most grave. 79. Assuming that the Metropolitan Asylums Board will make ample provision for such of our pauper population as may suffer from infectious disease, there will remain a certain number of non-pauper sick, for whom your Board is empowered to provide Hospital accommodation. "What that number may be, at any time, it is impossible to foresee. In the year 1870, there were not six cases of small pox, so far as they came under my knowledge, that were under private treatment, and of these, several were sent to hospital with the help of the parochial authorities. 80. The persons, not being paupers, who would particularly require your interferance in this district, are assistants and porters in retail establishments, and domestic servants, who, for the most part, have not "proper lodging or accommodation " when attacked by contagious disease. Besides these, there are the families of the working class population who occupy two or three rooms, and who might desire the removal of their sick. For all these, provision is required to bo made by the District Board. We are dependant for assistance, at present, on the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and on two or three recent occasions, during tho small pox epidemic, that aid could not be afforded on account of all the Board's Hospitals having been full. This may happen again, and embarrass us more in any future emergency than in the past. Now, I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction, that, upon the ground alike of convenience and economy, and also of the difficulty of drawing a dividing lino between those who arc paupers and nonpaupers in this grade of society, it would be desirable that the Metropolitan 20 Asylums Board should be charged with the duty of providing for this class of persons. But, failing the action of this Board, it would be necessary for your Board to act upon the powers given to you in the "Sanitary Act, 1866," and to establish a hospital under your own control for this class of cases not a temporary hospital, but a permanent one, always open and ready for the reception of patients. Self-supporting Hospitals. 81. I beg also to suggest that as there are' from time to time, many persons suffering from infectious disease whom it would be desirable to remove to a hospital, but for whom in the present vague state of the law, it is doubtful whether your Board could lawfully make provision out of the public funds; it is most expedient that Hospitals should be established, where such patients could be received on payment of a certain sum, sufficient to defray the expenses of medical care and maintenance. It is certain that many employers of labour would gladly, in cases of emergency, avail themselves of such accommodation for their dependants, and there can be no doubt also, that many friends of a better class of sufferers, would feel the advantage of such a resource on the breaking out of any infectious and dangerous disease. It is my opinion that such institutions should be established and managed by a public Board, and not left to the precarious support of voluntary agency. Such Institutions as these, co-operating with the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, would probably suffice to supply all the public needs arising from the spread of epidemic disorders. The Mortality in tlie Workhouse and other Local Institutions. 82. The number of Births in the "Workhouse during the year 1870, was 103, and the number of admissions 2,328, making a total of 2,431. The number of Deaths was 254, and of these, 24 had been inmates of the House for a longer period than 12 months; the others had died within the year of admission. The following tabular statement shows the length of residence in the House of the several patients. TABLE No. X.—Return of Deaths in Workhouse. Died within One Month from date of Admission 124 Ditto Two ditto ditto 46 Ditto Three ditto ditto 18 Ditto Four ditto ditto 9 Ditto Five ditto ditto 9 Ditto Six ditto ditto 8 Ditto Seven ditto ditto 4 Ditto Eight ditto ditto 2 Ditto Nine ditto ditto 5 Ditto Ten ditto ditto 1 Ditto Eleven ditto ditto 4 Ditto Twelve ditto ditto 0 Or longer periods 24 Total 254 83. This Return includes the still-births and inquest cases. It appears that of the entire mortality in the Workhouse, nearly one-half died within the first month of admission. This analysis shows that a considerable number of persons enter the "Workhouse as a last resource in sickness. (See next page Table XI.) 84. About one-half of the persons who died, were over 60 years of age. One woman is recorded to have died at the extreme age of 102. Tho deaths from phthisis and bronchitis make up about one-half of the mortality. 21 Deaths from, diseases of the heart have not been so numerous relatively to the total mortality within the House, as outside of it; but paralysis, as we might expect from the age of the inmates, has been much more fatal.

This excellent charity has met the wants of the district, with an increase of usefulness during the past year. The large number of 5,353 cases have been admitted, of which 1,171 were visited at their homes. The advantages which this Institution confers upon a class of humble persons who, but for the help it renders in their suffering, might be reduced to apply for parochial relief, cannot be too highly appreciated. The largest number of cases was admitted in the spring quarter; the smallest in the winter quarter; the deaths also in the winter quarter were compartively numerous.

The death-rate in this Institution, during the year 1870, has been, I regret to state, higher than usual, and it has been found necessary to close the wards, for a period, in consequence of the occurrence of puerperal fever. The number of deliveries was 175; and of the number of births, 75 Were males and 100 females. The deaths among the women were 9, and among the children, 15. Of the children, 10 were males, and 5 females. Two of the males and six of the females were stillborn, and four of the males and three of the females died from debility. Of the deaths among the women, 5 occurred from peritonitis, 2 also from peritonitis after premature delivery, necessitated, in one case by a tumour, and in the other by deformity, and 2 died from phthisis. Twenty-five of the patients belonged to St. Giles parish, and one to St. George Bloomsbury, 22 The Infants Home. 87. I am pleased to be able to give a more favourable account of this Institution this year than it has hitherto justified; the mortality among the children having been decidedly less. There were 52 children received into the House during the year, of whom 5 died, four of them from, as stated, "consumption." 102 children have been farmed out, and among these, only 6 deaths are reported. It will be remembered that last year, out of 97 children there had been 22 deaths. The improvement, therefore, is very marked, and I hope it will continue. Three of the children came from St Giles Workhouse. I am informed by Mrs. Main, that the receipts last year were £514, of which sum the mothers paid £382 13s. 10d. The Sanitary Work of the Year. 88. Every year makes the duty of our Inspectors more trying; partly because with more experience of its necessity, the inspection becomes more searching; partly because Parliament, in each succeeding session, passes laws imposing fresh duties; and partly, because the Privy Council presses, with more earnestness, year after year, the obligation of carrying out the sanitary measures which have been enacted in various statutes. Method of Inspection. 89. Since the epidemic of relapsing fever, a more systematic method of detecting zymotic diseases has been in operation than heretofore. The Inspectors have been instructed to call every morning upon Mr. Bennett, the Parochial Medical Officer, upon Dr. Grimes, the Resident Physician of Bloomsbury Dispensary, and upon certain private practitioners to obtain information of every case of zymotic disease that has some under their notice during the past twenty-four hours, and to report to me the result. The cases having been ascertained, the Inspectors visit the houses, and give notice for such improvements to be made and such disinfection to be done, as circumstances may require. Short of actual house-tohouse visitation, this is an complete a system as can be worked with our present staff; and I am glad to be able to add, that owing to the good will and ready assistance of the medical gentlemen applied to, the Inspectors have carried it out very satisfactorily. By this method, we are able to detect an epidemic disease in its beginning, when we have the best chance of checking it, and we get a daily register of its progress,—a register so full as to be closely approximative to the actual number of attacks, as our further inquiries of private practitioners, by circular, during the recent epidemic of small pox, has proved; for these inquiries did not bring to my knowledge more than six cases in four months that we bad not already registered. Every system, however well organised, is apt to get out of gear when there is little work to be done; this would happen to our method of sanitary inspection; but it is easy to give it a fresh impulse with the expected advent of epidemic disease. (See Table XIII. on following page.) I feel it incumbent on me to express my warmest acknowledgments of the cordial manner in which assistance has been rendered to your Board by the private practitioners of the District. Disinfecting Chamber. 90. Your Board, desirous of carrying out all such regulations as the sanitary necessities of the district seemed to require, has this year sanctioned the erection of a hot-air disinfecting chamber, as designed by Messrs. Fraser & Sons, Engineers, of Bow Common. This chamber is so constructed, that all the effluvia given off by the bedding in the process of heating, are carried by means of a flue through the furnace and destroyed, thus effectually preventing any contamination of the air. By using coke or smokeless coal also, no nuisance can arise from the chimney. In order to obviate, as much as possible, any chance of diffusing poison during the removal of infected goods from a house to the chamber, a closed truck has been provided, which, together with the bedding it contains, is put into the oven, and disinfected each time it is used. In some instances when it is found to be difficult to permeate thick flock bedding with hot-air, 23 heated at a sufficient temperature, without loss of fuel and time, sulphur or carbolic acid is introduced into the oven; the fumes of which complete the disinfection. The plan upon which this oven is constructed, appears to me to fulfil most of the conditions of a good disinfecting chamber. Some improvements have been made in it since its erection which have increased its efficiency. This chamber had not come into operation when the year 1870 had closed ; I am not therefore, now, in a condition to report upon it as a part of the work of that year; but I may add, that it has been in constant daily use since its erection, and that it proved a most valuable disinfecting agent during the epidemic of small pox.

In consequence of a coroner's jury having found that a death was accelerated by the foul smells arising from a rag shop adjoining the house where the death occurred, I made an inspection of all the rag and bone shops in the neighbourhood, and subsequently reported to your Board as to their condition, and suggested the formation of certain rules for their better regulation. Your Board, after having received a deputation from persons interested in the trade, and given your consideration to the subject, passed the following rules, which have been since printed and circulated: 1st. That, whenever practicable, persons be prohibited from warehousing rags in cellars. 24 2nd. That the premises where they are kept be cleared, lime-whited, and disinfected, at least once in three months. 3rd. That all bones be removed once in every week from 1st October to 1st April, and twice a week during the remainder of the year. One of the chief advantages of these rules will be to prevent the establishment of new businesses under circumstances detrimental to the public health. Improvements in Workshops. 92. A complaint having been made to me of a suffocating effluvium arising from the premises of Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, in Little Denmark Street, I made an inspection, and found that the noxious smoke was given off during the preparation of molasses for preserves. The operations complained of were promptly discontinued. The owner and occupier of a house in Queen's Place, Great Queen Street having complained of undue heating and vibration of a party wall, dividing the house from Messrs. Jacques & Co's foundry in the rear, of an offensive smoke issuing therefrom, and of consequent illness, I examined the premises, and on my pointing out the causes of the evil complained of, the manager of the works agreed to glaze the broken windows, to repair walls and roof, to provide proper supports for the engine, and to erect a nine inch brick wall between the furnace chamber and the adjoining house. Condemned Houses. 93. Certain houses in Abbey Place having appeared to me to be unfit for habitation, I gave a certificate to that effect, and in consequence of the action of your Board, Nos. 12 and 14 were improved in accordance with the Surveyor's Report, and the occupation of the others was discontinued. The house No. 4, Neal's Yard, being, also, in such a dirty and unwholesome state as to be unfit for human occupation, has, through the interferance of your Board, ceased to be occupied. Cow-houses. 94. These have been kept in good condition during the year, and your regulations as to the number of animals to be kept have been observed, except in the case of Mr. Rowe who has, with his customary indifference, systematically broken them. On the last licensing day, by the direction of your Board, I represented to the Justices the persevering violation of rule by Mr. Rowe, and they required him, as a condition of his obtaining his licence, to sign an agreement that he would henceforth comply with your regulations. The agreement was signed and the licence renewed. Mr. Lewis' Cow-shed in Ashlin's Place, was destroyed by fire during the year, and is now being re-built for a warehouse. Slaughter-houses. 95. These have been kept in a very cleanly state during the year. Most of them are but little used. That, however, of which Mr. Blackman is the owner, in Duke Street, Bloomsbury, requires strict supervision. Bake-houses. 96. The Inspectors have made no complaint of these, and there has been no occasion for interference; the owners, generally, being willing to observe the instructions of the Board. Cellars. 97. In several instances during the year, families have been removed from cellars, and no difficulty has been experienced in obtaining compliance with the notices. In this respect there has been a decided improvement of public feeling. The law itself, however, is very faulty, as it permits the occupation of cellars that are totally unfit for the habitation of human beings. Sewers. 98. New sewers have been constructed in King Street (Dials), Queen Street, Little Denmark Street, and a portion of Little Earl Street. Bad Food. 99. Inspector Dixon has seized 5 parcels of fish, 5 parcels of meat, and 12 parcels of fruit, making a total of 22 parcels. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE ROSS. 25 District. Street. No. Zymotic Diseases. Tuberculous Diseases. Pulmonary Dis. SmallFox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.
