To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington. I have the honour to submit my annual report for 1939 on the state of the public health in Kensington. In accordance with the wishes of the Minister of Health, this report has been considerably curtailed. The year 1939 was one in which civil defence measures assumed priority over other work, and to a large extent interfered with the normal work of the public health department. At the beginning of the war. eight full-size first aid posts and one small pose were established, these were all equipped with gas cleansing stations and staffed by fully-trained A.R.P. workers. A medical service, composed of doctors practising in the borough, was formed in connection with the first aid posts. Stretcher bearers totalling 500 men were billeted in two depots in the borough, and a service of cars was provided for the purpose of transport. The public health department assisted in the early days of the war in the evacuation of expectant mothers and children under five years of age. When war was declared, a skeleton maternity and child welfare service was established, but owing to the absence of expected air raids and the consequent gradual return of a large number of women and children to the borough, this service was augmented from time to time. An interesting development of this work was the opening of infant welfare centres at first aid posts, and valuable assistance was rendered by A.R.P. workers at the maternity and child welfare sessiona. Dr. Charles Hay, the deputy medical officer of health, was called up for active service at the end of August. Dr. Prank Stansfield was appointed as officer commanding stretcher bearers in October, 1939. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the borough as ascertained at the census of 1931 was 180,677 persons, but for the purpose of this report the population for 1939 has been given by the Registrar-General as 172,100 for estimating the birth rate, and 158,800 for the death rate. The latter figure is approximately the population ascertained by national registration at the commencement of the war. Births, Deaths, and Infant Mortality. The birth rate was 12.0 per 1,000 population. The death rate, baaed on the number of deaths of Kensington people, was 13 0 0 per 1,000 population; but when the adjusting factor, based on the age and sex distribution of the population, is applied, the death rate for the borough becomes 12.2, which is the figure used for comparison with other districts.

The following table shows the diphtheria immunisation work carried out during the year:- No. of pre-school children immunised 590 No, of school-children immunised 339 Total number of Children attending for pre-immunisation Schick tests 64 No, which gave positive reaction 30 No,of children presented for Schick testing after having received immunisation inoculations. 534 No. proving negative 462 No. proving positive 62 Whooping Cough Clinic Two hundred and ninety-six children were seen either at the clinic or in day nurseries.
