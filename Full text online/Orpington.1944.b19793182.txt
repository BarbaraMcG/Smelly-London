Bromlep: KENTISH DISTRICT TIMES CO., Ltd., 22, NORTH STREET. 1 URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL OF ORPINGTON. Health Report for 1944. Madam and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Health Report for the year 1944, this being the twenty-second one presented by me as your Medical Officer of Health. The population of the District at mid-year as estimated by the Registrar-General was 46,980, as compared with 48,520 last year. A small increase in the Birth Rate again took place this year, viz., 22.7 per thousand of population, as against 21.0 last year. The Death Rate for the year was equal to 11.4 per thousand of population, the Rate for last year being 11.2. The Infantile Mortality Rate again remained low, being 28 per thousand registered Births, as compared with 29 last year. The year has been a fairly satisfactory one from the point of view of incidence of Infectious Disease, the number of cases notified being 940 as compared with 980 last year. The great majority of these notifications referred to measles and whooping cough. In presenting this Report, I desire to express my thanks to the Council and its Officers for the help and assistance I have received. I particularly desire to record my appreciation of the local service rendered by all members of the Public Health Department. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, P. N.

In some outlying parts, however, water is obtained from deep wells, and from rain water collected from the roofs of houses and stored in tanks. The supply of water both as regards quality and quantity is satisfactory. Bacteriological examinations of the water are made regularly, an average of 4 samples being taken each month. No contamination of the water was discovered during the year, and there does not appear to be any risk of plumbo-solvent action. During the year 47 bacteriological and 2 chemical specimens of water were examined. All the bacteriological examinations showed that the water was of good quality. The two chemical analyses, however, showed the water to be of fair organic purity, but it was desirable that the water should be boiled before use for domestic purposes. PUBLIC CLEANSING. The collection of house refuse throughout the District is carried out by direct labour. Owing again to the shortage of labour, the removal of house refuse has presented difficulty. Although collection has not been carried out at pre-war frequency, the service throughout the District has been maintained. 10 CESSPOOL EMPTYING. No special action was taken with regard to the emptying of cesspools during the year. The Council undertakes the emptying of cesspools as circumstances permit. HOUSING. 1.
