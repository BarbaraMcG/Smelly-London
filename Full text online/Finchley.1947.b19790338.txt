Fletcher 3 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF FINCHLEY October, 1948 I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health, vital statistics and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1947. Since 1938, Annual Reports have been typewritten and have been bare summaries of the work of the Department. In order to make a more permanent record, statistical information pertaining to the past ten years has been collated and included in this Report. The vital statistics for 1947 are remarkably good. The birth rate is the highest since 1920—the infantile mortality rate at 20.5 is the lowest ever recorded for the Borough and is only one half the rate for England and Wales. The neo-natal death rate is also the lowest on record while the maternal mortality and stillbirth rates are both very satisfactory. The incidence of infectious diseases was low. No case of diphtheria has occurred since August 1946 and there has been no death since 1942. This satisfactory state of affairs is the result of the energetic manner in which immunisation has been tackled over the past fourteen years. There was an increase in the number of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and a slight increase in the number of deaths in males. The housing position does not improve. Overcrowding does not decrease in spite of all the Council have done in providing new housing accommodation. The condition of many of the older houses has continued to deteriorate because of the difficulty in getting the necessary repairs carried out which is largely due to licence restrictions and the shortage of materials and labour. In accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946, the Maternity and Child Welfare and Ambulance Services together with 119 members of your staff have been transferred to the County Council. Although none of the staff wished to leave your service all of them have accepted their transfer in good grace and I have no doubt that they will continue to give to their new masters the same loyal service which they have given to you. I have to thank all members of the staff of the Department for their loyalty and industry throughout the year and I would especially mention Mr. J. Gray, M.B.E., Senior Sanitary Inspector, and Mr. W. L. N. Relleen, Chief Clerk, for their assistance in the preparation of this report. I am, Your obedient Servant, A. A. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS Area (in acres) 3,477 Population, 1947 (Registrar-General's Estimate) 70,710 Number of Inhabited Houses (end of 1947) 19,304 Rateable Value (1947) £915,999 Sum represented by a Penny Rate £3,700 Total Live Births 1,319 Birth Rate per 1,000 population 18.65 Birth Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 20.5 Total Stillbirths 25 Stillbirth Rate per 1,000 (live & still) births 18.6 Total Deaths 830 Death Rate per 1,000 population 11.74 Death Rate per 1,000 population (England & Wales) 12.0 Infant Deaths 27 Infant Mortality Rate 20.5 Infant Mortality Rate (England & Wales) 41 Maternal Deaths 1 Maternal Mortality Rate 0.74 Maternal Mortality Rate (England & Wales) 1.17 Live Births: Males Females Total Legitimate 656 599 1.255 Illegitimate 37 27 64 693 626 1,319 Birth rate: 18.65 Per 1.ooo estimated resident population Stillbirths: Males Females Total 13 12 25 Rate:18.6 per 1,000 (live and still) births.

The following table shows the changes in population over the past 10 years. 1938 65,140 !939 65,740 1940 59,840 1941 58,030 1942 59,990 1943 60,700 !944 59,730 1945 61,370 1946 68,670 1947 70,710 5 Birth and Death Rates for the past 25 years 6 BIRTHS There were 1,319 registered live births in 1947, the highest ever recorded. The birth-rate was 18.65 and the rate for England and Wales was 20.5. There were 64 illegitimate births, which is 4 more than in 1946. The natural increase in the population, or the ex-cess of live births over deaths, was 488. The number of live births and the birth-rate per 1,000 of the population for the Borough and the birth-rate for England and Wales over the past 10 years are shown in the following table:— Year Legitimate Illegitimate Total Births Birth Rate M F T otal M F Total Finchley E & W 1938 463 418 881 22 24 46 927 14.23 15.1 1939 436 464 900 24 27 51 951 14.46 15.0 1940 322 360 682 16 13 - 29 711 12.1 14.3 1941 361 322 683 26 12 38 721 12.42 14.2 1942 439 410 849 20 22 42 891 14.9 15.8 1943 498 491 989 26 20 46 1,035 17.05 16.5 1944 509 473 982 29 26 55 1,037 17.36 17.6 1945 483 436 919 30 38 68 987 16.08 16.1 1946 580 567 1,147 28 32 60 1,207 17.57 19.1 1947 656 599 1,255 37 27 64 i,3!9 18.65 20.5 STILLBIRTHS There were 35 stillbirths in 1947, giving a rate of 0.35 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 0.50 for England and Wales.

Twelve died before they were one month old, 5 between 1 and 3 months, 5 between 3 and 6 months, 1 between 6 and 9 months and 4 between 9 and 12 months. The causes of death were as follows:— Pneumonia 6 Premature Births 4 Enteritis 4 Congenital defects 4 Birth Injury 3 Whooping Cough 1 Other causes 5 27 The infantile mortality rate was 20.5 per 1,000 which is the lowest rate in Finchley's history. The corresponding rate for England and Wales was exactly double at 41. The neo-natal death'rate at 9.1 was also the lowest on record. 7 Infant Death, Neo-Natal Death, and Stillbirth Rates for the past 25 years 8 The following table shows infant death rates for the past 10 years:— Year Finchley England and Wales Rate per 1,000 live births No. of deaths Rate per 1,000 live births 1938 33 35.59 53 1939 35 36.80 50 1940 27 37.97 55 1941 15 21.80 59 1942 48 53.90 49 1943 57 55.07 49 1944 34 32.79 46 1945 36 36.37 46 1946 30 24.85 43 1947 27 20.50 41 MATERNAL MORTALITY One mother died in 1947 giving a maternal mortality rate of 0.74 per 1,000 births. The rate for England and Wales was 1.17. DEATHS There were 830 deaths in 1947, 56 more than in 1946. The death-rate was 11.74 per 1,000 estimated resident population and for England and Wales it was 12.0. The increase in the number of deaths in 1947 over the previous year is almost entirely due to the fact that deaths from disease of the heart and circulatory system had gone up by 51.

As a result of the increase in the birth-rate the centres have become overcrowded and arrangements have been made to increase the weekly sessions to 10.

Eight hundred and eighty-two mothers attended the antenatal clinic in 1947 as compared with 912 in 1946 and 772 in 1945. The number of women attending represented 65.6% of the total notified births. The expansion of this service over the past 10 years may be seen from the following table:— Year No. of expectant mothers attended No. of attendances 1938 420 1,427 1939 503 1,989 1940 551 2,214 1941 704 2,921 1942 820 3,827 1943 799 2,812 1944 565 3,494 1945 772 3,610 1946 912 4,305 1947 882 4,226 DOMICILIARY MIDWIFERY There are 4 Municipal Midwives all of whom are trained in the administration of analgesia. During the year they attended 231 cases as Midwives and 39 as Maternity Nurses. MATERNITY ACCOMMODATION The difficulty in getting institutional accommodation for confinements was as acute as ever it has been and admission had to be limited to those for whom it was necessary on medical grounds or on account of unsuitable home conditions. The following table shows the known place of confinement of Finchley mothers in 1947. Private Homes in Finchley 315 Nursing Homes in Finchley 129 North Middlesex County Hospital 243 Wellhouse Hospital 3 London Hospitals 245 Nursing Homes outside Finchley 286 Private Homes outside Finchley 11 Hospitals outside London 66 1,298 10 Attendances of Children at Infant Welfare Centres, 1927-1947 11 Expectant Mothers Attending Ante-Natal Clinic, 1930-1947 12 ANTENATAL EXERCISES These exercises are conducted with a view to making confinements easier. During the year 35 mothers made 229 attendances. There can be little doubt that young mothers derive a good deal of confidence as a result of these exercises at a time when this is of great importance to them. POST-NATAL CLINIC This Clinic continued to serve a very useful purpose and the mothers attending for examination totalled 237 in 1947 as compared with 164 in 1946 and 131 in 1945. SUNLIGHT CLINIC During 1947, 55 children and 5 mothers received courses of ultra-violet radiation and made 608 attendances. DENTAL TREATMENT Dental treatment is provided at the Health Centre for children under 5 years of age and for expectant and nursing mothers. Three sessions per week are devoted to this work and arrangements have been made to increase the number to four. The following table shows the dental work carried out during the past 10 years.

PREMATURE INFANTS AND ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN There has been no change in the arrangements for dealing with these children. During the year the deaths of 4 infants were attributed to prematurity. Three illegitimate children under the age of one year died in 1947. ADOPTION OF CHILDREN Close co-operation is maintained with the Adoption Societies and the Court Officers. The homes are visited by the Health Visitors and reports are furnished on their suitability for the reception and care of a child. CHILD LIFE PROTECTION The Health Visitors are also Child Life Protection Visitors. The demand for foster parents far exceeds the supply and this is not difficult to understand as the amount of money offered for the care of a child is usually ridiculously small. At the end of the year 18 foster parents were looking after 20 foster children. 13 DAY NURSERIES There are 3 day nurseries—2 war-time nurseries and the Council's permanent nursery which was first opened at Bourchier House in 1920 and transferred to the New Health Centre in 1939. There are 140 places for children up to 3 years of age. It was originally intended that when the children reached the age of 3 years they would be transferred to the Nursery Schools but unfortunately these are not able to take in all the children at that age with the result that quite a number have to remain at the nurseries for another year so limiting the intake of younger children. The health of the children was particularly good during the year and cases of infectious illnesses were very few. DOMESTIC AND HOME HELPS The demand for helps is always in excess of the supply. During the year assistance was given to 336 households, and many letters of appreciation of the service were received. JOINT AMBULANCE SERVICE This Service was transferred to Middlesex County Council on the 5th July, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act, 1946. During 1947 the demands for the use of Ambulances continued to grow and the Staff have given very good service. There are now 5 modern ambulances and 1 fairly old. One new vehicle is on order. A car for sitting cases is also kept. The 24 hours are divided into 3 shifts of 8 hours, 8 a.m.—4 p.m., 4 p.m.—midnight, midnight—8 a.m. In the first shift 5 ambulances and the car are manned, in the second 3 ambulances and in the third 2 ambulances. Reciprocal arrangements exist with adjoining local authorities. The times that we require assistance from neighbours, and they from us, are about equal. Removals are comparatively easy to cope with but accidents, which constitute about 10% of the total calls, have the habit of occurring in batches and it inevitably happens on occasions that no ambulance is available at once and a few complaints have been received on this account. On the other hand many letters of appreciation of the service have been received. A total of 12,904 cases were moved in 1947. (121,857 miles.) MORTUARY Eighty-two bodies were received in the Mortuary and 21 of these were from Friern Barnet. 14 INFECTIOUS DISEASES The following table shows the number of cases notified:— 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 Diphtheria 22 5 42 38 19 9 3 4 13 — Scarlet Fever 115 100 58 51 141 194 125 109 102 97 Smallpox — — — — — — 3 — — — Enteric Fever 3 1 — 6 1 1 — — — — Cerebro Spinal Fever — 1 9 8 4 3 1 1 4 2 Poliomyelitis 2 2 1 — — 1 1 1 7 3 Pneumonia 21 37 33 51 42 60 49 38 56 48 Measles — 3 51 647 593 364 83 618 403 167 Whooping Cough — 1 33 376 116 78 201 57 158 138 Infectious diseases were not very prevalent during 1947. There were a fair number of cases of Measles and Whooping Cough and there was one death from the latter disease. There were 3 cases of Poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis); none died but one was left with serious paralysis. The decline in the incidence of Scarlet Fever from the peak in 1943 continued and the mild character of the disease was maintained. For the first time on record no case of Diphtheria occurred in the Borough; in fact, at the time of writing this report, no case has occurred for over two years and for the 5th successive year there has been no death from Diphtheria. This is a record to be proud of but there must be no complacency. Immunisation must be pushed as hard as ever or this dread disease will surely return. The position regarding the mortality from the common infectious diseases today as compared with what it was in the early days of the present century is vividly shown in the following table in which statistics for 1907 and 1947 are given. The table needs no comment.

Apart from the work relating to infectious diseases, samples of milk, drinking water and swimming bath water and numerous specimens taken in food poisoning outbreaks have been examined. The laboratory is of the greatest value to the Borough and a tremendous help to the Medical Officer of Health 15 Incidence of Diphtheria for the past 25 years l6 The following table shows the number and nature of the specimens dealt with during 1947 Throat/Nose Swabs Positive Negative Diphtheria Bacilli 214 Hemolytic Streptococci 136 Vincent's Angina 7 Faeces Sonne Dysentery 8 56 Salmonella 2 Sputum T.B.

Five non-pulmonary cases were notified comprising 1 male and 4 females. There were 27 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis and 2 from non-pulmonary tuberculosis. This gives a total of 29 deaths from all forms of tuberculosis, 20 males and 9 females. The death-rate for the disease was 0.41 per 1,000 of the population. The following table shows the number of notifications and the number of deaths during the past 10 years:— Year NeW Cases Deaths Pulmonary Non-Pulmonarv Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F M F M F M F 1938 47 27 4 10 13 9 3 1 1939 34 30 6 8 16 7 2 — 1940 28 21 4 4 16 10 2 2 1941 34 38 5 7 18 15 2 1 1942 40 39 4 3 14 19 1 1 1943 4i 39 1 5 14 11 3 5 1944 48 3° 8 8 14 9 3 2 1945 49 41 8 1 17 9 5 1 1946 43 26 2 8 14 9 1 2 1947 54 36 1 4 18 9 2 - 17 HOUSING STATISTICS—1947 1.

As the owners were unable to tome to any arrangement to carry out the necessary work, the Council commenced negotiations for the compulsory purchase of the property with a view to conversion into four flats. 21 & 23 Granville Road, N.12 Undertakings to render these houses fit for human habitation had been given by the owners and accepted by the Council. The work of repair was nearing completion at the end of the year. 18 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA The following are the particulars of the work dealt with by your Sanitary Inspectors during the year 1947. INSPECTIONS The total number of inspections made during the year was 12,855. At 1,153 Of the houses and other premises visited, defects or nuisances to the number of 4,028 were discovered, and at the end of the year 1,570 of these had been remedied or abated, the work in connection with 557 was in hand and the remaining 1,892 were outstanding. In order to ascertain that the sanitary defects were being properly remedied, 631 visits were paid to the respective premises while the work was in progress. Difficulty was experienced in getting work done as is evidenced by the number of defects outstanding at the end of the year, due to the shortage of materials. The total number of inspections made in regard to each section of work is recorded in the appended table, together with a summary of the sanitary improvements carried out:— Inspections under Housing Acts 40 Special Inspections 3,462 Inspections of Houses Let in Lodgings 23 Re-inspections 1,864 Inspections of Works in Progress 631 Inspections of Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (including Bakehouses and Restaurant Kitchens) 191 Visits to Slaughterhouses 3 Inspections of Cowsheds, Dairies and Milkshops 25 Inspections of Ice Cream Premises 41 Inspections of Meat, Fish and other Food Shops (including Meat Depot) 489 Inspections of Shops (Shops Act) 8 Visits re Infectious Disease and Verminous Premises 817 Visits re Rodent Control 2,816 Visits re Housing Act, 1936 236 Visits re Building Licences 1,617 Visits to Hawkers' Premises 9 Miscellaneous 583 Total number of Inspections and Re-inspections 12,855 SUMMARY OF SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS CARRIED OUT Drainage Number of houses and premises re-drained 5 Repairs or amendments to existing drains 34 Drains or gullies unstopped or cleansed 117 Length in yards of stoneware drains laid 236 Length in yards of heavy cast iron drains laid 15 Manholes provided 11 Manholes repaired 15 Intercepting traps fixed 3 Fresh air inlets provided or repaired 14 New gully traps fixed 29 Gullv curbs provided or repaired 22 New soil pipes and ventilating shafts fixed 4 Soil pipes and ventilating shafts repaired 12 Water tests applied 96 Smoke tests applied 11 Air tests applied 3 19 Water Closets and Sanitary Fittings New W.C. basins fixed 139 W.C.'s unstopped, cleansed or repaired 69 New flushing boxes fitted to W.C.'s 30 Existing flushing boxes repaired 48 New W.C. apartments provided 5 New W.C. accommodation provided 1 Ventilated lobbies provided 2 Existing W.C. apartments improved 1 Urinals cleansed or repaired 3 Lavatory basins provided 6 Baths provided 2 New impervious sinks provided 12 New waste pipes fixed 23 Waste pipes trapped, repaired or unstopped 31 Miscellaneous New roofs constructed 7 Roofs repaired 307 Eaves guttering renewed, cleansed or repaired 141 Stack pipes provided, repaired or unstopped 83 Stack pipes disconnected from drains 1 Damp walls remedied 162 Walls repointed, repaired or underpinned 89 Chimney pot provided 1 Ventilation .under floors provided or unstopped 9 Yards paved 6 Paving of yards repaired 12 Floors of rooms relaid 6 Floors of rooms repaired 65 Rooms cleansed, distempered or repapered 596 Plasterwork repaired 465 Windows repaired and/or made to open 223 New windows provided 10 New sash cords provided 265 Window sills repaired or provided 65 Doors provided or repaired 65 Doorsteps provided or repaired 12 Handrails to staircases provided 2 Staircases repaired 24 New ranges and stoves provided 23 Stoves and ranges repaired 70 Coppers repaired 2 Workrooms (including bakehouses) cleansed and repaired 1 Cisterns provided 17 Cisterns repaired, cleansed and covered 19 Water serYice pipes repaired 76 Movable sanitary dustbins provided 134 Nuisances from the keeping of animals abated 2 Accumulations of refuse removed 7 Accumulation of manure removed 1 Miscellaneous 61 CONSERVANCY SYSTEM Number of houses provided with pail closets 5 NOTICES SERVED Informal notices 1,082 Statutory notices 37 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION Number of rooms disinfected after infectious disease 193 Verminous rooms disinfested 170 Number of articles disinfected 2,202 Number of verminous premises dealt with 70 817 visits were made bv your inspectors and disinfectors in connection with cases of infectious disease and verminous premises and the necessary investigations were made in order to obtain the detailed information required. The number of houses found to be infested with bugs and dealt with during 1947 was as follows:— Council houses — Other houses 40 Insecticides containing D.D.T. were employed for freeing infested houses from bed bugs. In all cases where necessary wall and/or ceiling paper is stripped off and mouldings, skirtings, etc. are eased or removed. Bedding and similar articles are removed and subjected to steam disinfection. 20 The foregoing- methods of disint'estation are carried out by the Corporation's own staff. The houses occupied by persons about to remove to Council dwellings are examined by the Housing Manager or one of the Sanitary Inspectors and any infested articles therein are either disinfested or destroyed. The houses which have been disinfested are revisited in order to ascertain whether or not further treatment is necessary, and the tenants are requested to co-operate with the department by keeping their houses in a cleanly state and reporting any reappearance of bugs. Since the introduction and use of D.D.T. the need for repeat disinfestation has been less frequent. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS During the year one addition was made to the Register of Houses let in Lodgings. The number of registered premises in the district is now 84. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There are no common lodging houses in the district. SANITARY CONVENIENCES There are 24 conveniences attached to licensed houses within the district. These premises are inspected periodically. There are 9 public conveniences in the district, including 2 in the Victoria Recreation Ground which are situated close to the public highway. Seven of these conveniences provide accommodation for both sexes and 2 accommodation for males only. COMPLAINTS Eight hundred and four complaints were received with reference to the following matters, viz:— Blocked or defective drains 53 Insanitary condition of mews and passages 4 Insanitary or defective condition of houses 223 Blocked or defective W.C.'s 40 Defective roofs 30 Non-removal of refuse 2 Nuisance from dampness 36 Nuisance from overcrowding 5 Nuisance from keeping animals 8 Accumulations of refuse or manure 23 Burning of refuse 3 Absence of or defective dustbins 13 Nuisances from pig bins 5 Smoke nuisance 10 Smells from public sewers 1 Premises infested with rats or mice 265 Premises infested with insects 9 Shops Acts 1 Flooding 4 Unsound Food 20 Water supply 9 Condition of Dollis Brook 4 Other complaints 36 The complaints were investigated promptly and in those cases in which the Council had power to intervene the necessary steps were taken to remove the cause of complaint. PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT In accordance with the request of the Minister of Health contained in Circular 120, the cinemas, dance halls and other places of public entertainment have been inspected, special attention being given to the condition and adequacy of the sanitary accommodation. The defects discovered as a result of these inspections were remedied, after notice had been given to the persons responsible. A report upon the premises was submitted to the Middlesex County Council, which is the licensing authority for the district of Finchley. The number of premises dealt with was 18. PREMISES PERIODICALLY INSPECTED The following premises were visited periodically during the year and any matters found requiring attention were dealt with:— Description of Premises No. in District Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops 26 Factories, Workshops and Workplaces (incl. Bakehouses & Restaurant Kitchens) 377 Friecl Fish shops 6 Ice Cream Premises 68 Places of Public Entertainment 18 Public House Conveniences 24 Slaughterhouses 4 Shops re Food Supplies 229 752 21 FACTORY ACT, 1937 1.

The occupiers of several more bakehouses have co-operated and converted their ovens from solid fuel to gas. The owners of a new factory agreed to instal oil burning apparatus for use in connection with their boiler plant. INSPECTION OF MEAT AND FOOD The inspection of food and food preparing premises has received the special attention of the sanitary Inspectors. Many new food shops, chiefly cafes and greengrocers have been opened up in the district and although there appears to be little difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission of the Ministry of Food for this purpose there is great difficulty in obtaining suitable materials and equipment to bring the premises up to the standard one would desire. It is the opinion of the department that the time has arrived when, if such shops are necessary, they shoulcf be properly equipped. 642 visits have been made by your inspectors to various food premises. The list of food condemned is shown below. Four private slaughterhouses are licensed and occasional slaughter is carried on at one of them on permits from the Food Office. UNSOUND FOOD 9354½ lbs.

The first outbreak was in a factory where meals were supplied from the canteen. The food was prepared by a firm of caterers who operated the canteen, which supplied approximately 300 of the factory staff, and 60 people were taken ill after eating a mid-day meal. Samples of various foods were taken and exhaustive enquiries made, but the outbreak could not be traced to any particular item on the menu. The preparation of the food and the general management of the canteen left much to be desired. A new firm of caterers was engaged by the factory and improvements were carried out in the canteen. The second outbreak was more widespread and arose from infected haslet prepared by a firm in Suffolk and distributed to a number of shops in districts around London. About 5 people in Finchley were affected. A sample of the haslet was examined at. the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, and was found to be infected with staphylococcus aureus, suspected to be due to handling at the place of manufacture. HUMANE SLAUGHTER OF ANIMALS In accordance with the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, all animals, including sheep,, slaughtered in a slaughter-house within the district must be stunned by means of a mechanically operated instrument kept in proper repair. This method of slaughter continues to prove satisfactory. LICENSED SLAUGHTERMEN The Act also provides that no animal shall be slaughtered or stunned by any person who is not the holder of a licence granted bv the local authority. The licences granted by the Town Council have to be renewed annually. The number of persons licensed under the Act during 1947 was 5. BUTCHERS' SHOPS There are 48 butchers' shops in the district. All the shops are provided with glass fronts. These premises have been visited and the provisions of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations which provide for the cleanliness of the premises, apparatus, utensils and vehicles, the precautions to be taken against the contamination of meat; the storage and removal of refuse, etc., have been, generally, well observed. BAKEHOUSES The number of bakehouses in the district is 31. At 25 bakehouses motive power is used. The bakehouses have been visited by your inspectors and steps have been taken to cause them to be maintained in a proper sanitary condition. The periodical limewashing of these premises, as required by statute, has been carried out. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS There are 26 dairies, cowsheds and milkshops in the district. There were no new registrations of milk purveyors during the year. Inspections of all dairy premises have been maintained and the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926 with respect to the cleanliness of dairies and cowsheds, the protection of milk against infection and contamination, and the conveyance and distribution of milk have been generally well observed. The veterinary inspection of the cows kept in the district is carried out by the Middlesex County Council. A mechanical milking plant with weight recording apparatus was installed in a cowshed attached to one of the large dairies and is working very satisfactorily and at another large dairy new bottling, bottle capping and washing machines have been installed. 24 THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS) REGULATIONS Licences were granted by the Council in respect of designated milk for the year ended 31st December, 1947 as follows :— Dealers' licences to sell milk as Tuberculin Tested 8 Dealers' licences to sell milk as Accredited — Dealers' licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 14 Supplementary licences to sell milk as Pasteurised 3 Licence in respect of establishment in which Tuberculin Tested milk is bottled 1 Licences in respect of establishments in which the process of pasteurising milk is carried on 2 Five samples of Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) and 5 of Pasteurised milk were taken on behalf of the Council and submitted for bacteriological examination. These samples complied with the prescribed conditions. ICE CREAM PREMISES During the year "The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947" came into force and controlled the method by which ice cream should be manufactured. As a result of consultation with the few persons making ice cream within the area at the time only one is now actually manufacturing by the heat treatment method, the others using proprietary powders known as 'complete cold mix' which requires the addition of water only. Most of the ice cream sold is manufactured outside the district. There are 68 ice cream premises registered within the district. COFFEE STALLS The number of coffee stalls in the district is two. Both these stalls are situated in the main roads. These stalls are visited at intervals and action is taken to secure the provision of a satisfactory water supply, suitable means of food storage, cleanliness of stalls and utensils and proper means for the storage and disposal of refuse. FISH FRIERS In accordance with the provisions of Section 107 of the Public Health Act, 1936, fish frying now ceases to be an offensive trade as no new order has been made within the Borough. This business is established at 6 premises, no applications being received during the year. GAME LICENCES Thirteen applications were received under Section 27 of the Local Government Act, 1894, from tradesmen in the district for licences to deal in game. A licence was granted in each instance. THE SHOPS ACTS, 1912-1936 Inspection of shops in the district has been carried out and complaints and contraventions dealt with. Particulars in regard to the shops on the Register are as follows :— Number on register at beginning of 1947 827 Number closed 4 New shops 20 Number on register at end of 1947 843 Changes of occupancy 14 Infringements recorded 1 MOTOR TRADERS EXEMPTION ORDER In January 1938 an application was received signed by all the traders in the district engaged in the sale of motor cars requesting the Town Council to make an Order under the Shops Act, 1912, wholly exempting their particular class of shop from closing not later than 1 o'clock in the afternoon on one weekday in every week. Consequent upon the receipt of this application, the Town Council made the necessary Order under Section 4 (4) of the Shops Act, 1912. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Legal proceedings were taken in the following instances :— (1) A firm of dairymen were summoned for selling milk in a dirty bottle. The defendants were fined £5 5s. od. and ordered to pay £ 10 10s. od. costs. (2) The owners of a house were summoned for failing to carry out repairs to comply with an abatement notice. The defendants were fined £2 os. od. and ordered to pay £5 5s. od. costs. 25 RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919 GENERAL The duties under the above mentioned Act were delegated to the Borough Council by the Middlesex County Council on ist April, 1944, the Borough Council having acted as their agents from 1st February to 31st March of that year. Mr. J. Yates was appointed as Rodent Destruction Officer and one operator was appointed for Finchley and Friern Barnet. The joint use of this operator continued until 31st March, 1946, when Friern Barnet appointed an operator for their own area. The Council decided to make a nominal charge of 2/6 for each private dwelling house treated, while industrial or business premises were charged on the cost of labour and materials. These arrangements have proved to be satisfactory. The number of food premises with infestations of either rats or mice has proved to be particularly small. Valuable work has been carried out since February, 1944, including the initial treatment of all sewers in 1945, and two maintenance treatments per annum since. A few major infestations have been discovered and treated. At the present time no major infestation is known to exist. Of the surface infestations found and dealt with over 40% were at premises where poultry is kept. Poultry keepers are now taking much more notice of the advice given them after disinfestation. RATS It is noteworthy that the annual number of complaints is steadily decreasing and I feel this is consistent with the regular treatment of sewers and the remedying of "breaksout" from sewers. COUNCIL PROPERTY 1 reatment at the Refuse Destructor and Sewage Farm has been so successful that a rat is seldom seen now, whereas when treatment commenced rats could be seen at any time of the day. The initial treatment of the sewers within the district was delayed until August 1945 owing to the shortage of labour, but with the aid of 10 Italian collaborators the work was completed within scheduled time. For this purpose the Borough was divided into ten well defined areas and each manhole was prebaited on four successive days, poison bait being laid on the fifth day. A second treatment of certain manholes was carried out within one month of the first treatment, the only difference being that a different bait and poison was used. Maintenance treatments have revealed persistent "takes" in certain manholes, which may be due to the absence of manholes within reasonable distances or long lengths of public sewers (repairable by the owners) being infested and there being no means of access. These two ideas are being pursued. MICE Complaints of mice have greatly increased since 1944.

A large number of the visits and much of the inspectors' time was taken up with regard to the issue of building licences and work in connection with rodent control, with the consequent result that routine inspections were not carried out with the frequency that one would desire. There was a falling off in the number of visits to food premises in 1946 owing to the closing down of the Meat Distributing Depot at North Finchley but an increase in 1947 due to closer supervision of food preparing premises. 34 COMPARATIVE FIGURES— 1938 to 1947 (INCLUSIVE) 1938 1939 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 Total number of inspections 15,57o 11,490 7,247 7,858 8,700 8,525 10,469
