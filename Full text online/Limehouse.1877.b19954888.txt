BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER of HEALTH for fthe year 1877 10 Jan TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE LIMEHOUSE DISTRICT. Gentlemen , I have the honour to submit to you my Report on the Health and Sanitary condition of your District during the year 1877. During that period there were registered 2,146 Births and 1,287 Deaths; from this latter number must be deducted the number of deaths of persons not belonging to the District, but who died within its boundaries, and to the result must be added the number of deaths of persons, who though belonging to the District, died without its boundaries. The resulting number will represent the total mortality for the year, thus— Total Deaths registered 1,287 Deduct number of non-residents who died within the District 43 1,244 Add number of residents who died without the district 269 Total number of Deaths 1,513 2 It is upon this number that all the calculations in the following pages are based. In order to arrive at a correct appreciation of the value of the foregoing figures, and of those which are to follow, I deem it expedient to state at this stage of my report, that I estimate the populalation of the Limehouse District at 60,000 persons. Assuming this number as correct, we shall find that the birth-rate of the District during the year was 35 per 1,000 of the population, and that the death-rate was 25 per 1,000. The deaths of children under five years constitute 45 per cent, of the total mortality. In this respect there is an improvement of the public health ; the deaths in the corresponding section of the population during the year 1876, being 53 per cent, of the total mortality, and the average of the seven years, 1869-75, being 50 per cent. The total number of deaths in Public Institutions which concern your District was 341. The deaths from the seven principal Zymotic diseases, were as follows :— Smallpox 89 Measles 71 Scarlet Fever 20 Diphtheria 5 Whooping Cough 47 Fever 22 Diarrhoea 66 Total 320 3 The deaths per 1,000 of the population from the above named causes, were at the rate of 5.3., and the proportion of deaths from these causes to every 1,000 deaths was 211. Pulmonary diseases destroyed 267 lives, thus occasioning a mortality of 4.4 per 1,000 population, and giving a proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths of 176; that is to say, that for every 1,000 deaths registered from all causes, 176 of them were due to diseases of the Pulmonary organs. Diseases of a Tubercular character caused the death of 176 persons ; the deaths per 1,000 of the population from these causes were three, and the proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths was 116. The Wasting diseases of infants, such as Marasmus, Atrophy, Debility, and Premature Birth, caused the destruction of 91 lives; the deaths per 1,000 of the population from these diseases were 1.5, and the proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths was GO. The Convulsive disease of infants are credited with 112 deaths this number indicates a mortality per 1,000 population of 1.8, and a proportion of 74 for every 1,000 deaths registered. Of all these diseases, the one that claims our special attention is Smallpox, and it is to that disease that I now beg to draw your attention. Already in the Autumn of 1876 symptoms of its advance began to be observed; and before the year was ended, we found ourselves assailed by it in an epidemic form.With the new year the disease increased, and in the month of January alone 64 cases were reported to me. Information of these cases was given 4 to me principally by the Officials of the Stepney Union. In every instance where it was practicable, the removal of the sick was urged, and in the majority of cases effected. These removals were conducted by the Officers of the Stepney Union, and the patients were removed to the Hospitals under the control of the Metropolitan Asylum District Board. Every possible disinfection was practised, the premises were fumigated, clothing, bedding, &c. disinfected by heat, in the disinfecting chamber belonging to the Board; the drains were flushed frequently with disinfectants, and a large quantity of infected clothing, not suitable for disinfection, destroyed, and notices served upon the owners of infected premises for the cleansing of the same. During the year 402 cases were reported to me, and 3,420 articles were disinfected in the apparatus of the Board. For the number of houses disinfected, notices served, and other works of a sanitary character, I beg to refer you to Table 7 in the Appendix. As stated above, the removals were effected by the Union Officers to Hospitals, designed more especially for the use of the destitute, and considerable embarrassment was felt in so dealing with many of the cases that occurred, which were decidedly not destitute. You are, of course, aware that by the Sanitary Act of 1866, you are empowered to provide Hospital accommodation in your District for persons suffering from infectious diseases, and you are also given power to provide means of transit thither, but owing, principally to the difficulty of obtaining sites for the erection of these Hospitals, this Section of the Act has, with one or two exceptions, where the Sanitary Authority has had the good fortune, on account of the locality, to be able to provide these 5 Hospitals, been a dead letter. However, your Sanitary Committee had under its consideration frequently the possibility of providing such accommodation, but the obstacles to such provision appearing almost insurmountable, an understanding was come to with the Guardians, whereby all cases were removed, whether belonging to the destitute class or not. The question of provision of Hospital accommodation for the non-destitute class by the Sanitary Authority, being one that requires, and will receive at your hands careful consideration, I will content myself for the present, by saying that I am of opinion that such provision could be best made by some central Authority of a representative character. The following table, shewing the number of cases that occurred in each month, will give you some idea of the progress of the disease during the year :— In January 64 cases were reported. February 36 " " March 31 " " April 36 " " May 61 " " June 21 " " July 18 " " August 7 " " September 1 " " October 5 " " November 48 " " December 74 " " Total 402 6 Regarding the invasion of the disease, I can only say what I have said many times before, that I consider it due to neglect of vaccination and re-vaccination, and the inefficient performance of primary vaccination. As regards the neglect of vaccination, I have not much to say—the Vaccination Acts are, I believe, acting satisfactorily, and at the present time I have reason to hold the opinion that a very small per centage of children escape vaccination entirely. The protection afforded, however, by this first vaccination is not lifelong, and for a person to be thoroughly protected, he should undergo the operation a second time, at or about the period of puberty. I am not stating the fact too strongly, when I say that a person properly vaccinated in infancy, and re-vaccinated at puberty, is practically Smallpox proof for life. With regard to inefficient vaccination, I may state here, that I consider no vaccination efficient unless it has been performed in at least four places. Dr. Gayton, the Medical Superintendent of the Homerton Smallpox Hospital, writing of the epidemic, says: "The great contrast between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated is unmistakable and incontrovertible, and the same remark holds good as regards the vaccinated also, the difference in the latter being, that in some of them, the disease is of a mild form, in others, most severe, sometimes terminating in death." Thus, of 183 having one good mark, 19 died; of 461 with two good marks, 17 died; of 331 with three good marks, 10 died; of 222 with four or more good marks, 4 died, giving an average rate of mortality of 10.38 per cent., 3.68 per cent., 3.20 per cent., and 1.80 per cent, respectively, or taking all good cicatrices together, whether they be one, two, 7 three, four or more, we find that only 3.57 per cent with imperfect marks, there were 2,165cases,of whom 247diedmakingthe mortality 11.40 per cent, the average mortality being,with case cicatrix. 15.93 per cent, with two cicatrices. 11.52 percent and with three cicatrices, 7.90 per cent, and with four or more cicatrices, 5.75 per cent; of those stated to Have been vaccinated, but out evidence, 674 hare come undrr notice, of whom 194 died.or at the rate per cent of 28.78, and lastly 1.243 were confidently unvaccinated, and of these 574 died, or at the rate of 46.17 per cent Speaking of the value of re-vaccination, Dr. Gayton says:I am unable to give any copious statistics with regard to re-vaccination I simply find that daring the time I hare been connected with this Hospital, 13 only have been admitted, who stated that they had undergone the operation the second time, and in these cases I was only able to discover ocular proof of five one of whom suffered from an extremely severe attack of Smallpox. That one only amongst the large number of nurses and other who have been occupied here (and in her case the operation was neglected) hare contracted the disease is, or should be, convincing proof enough of its great and almost certain prophylactic influence. Dr. Collie, the Medical Superintendent of the Fever Hospital. says of the caeca of Smallpox that came under his care:the unvaccinated died at the rate of 53 per cent that raccinated died at the rate of 26 per cent: that the fairly well vaccinated died at the rate of 2.3 per cent, end that but one death. 8 occurred in any person under 16 years of age who showed two good cicatrices of vaccination, and after 16, only three such persons died." Dr. Fox, the Medical Superintendent of the Fulham Smallpox Hospital, writes as follows :—" Firstly, not a single patient died out of 51 admitted, who had four or more marks of whatever quality they were: further, they were all mild cases, and with one or two exceptions, all above puberty, i.e., the effect of vaccination was wearing out. Secondly, whereas the unvaccinated died at the rate of 43.54 per cent., the vaccinated (and many had the merest apology for vaccination marks) died at the rate of 7.6 per cent. Thirdly, that as the number of marks increase, especially if they be of good quality, so the protection increases, as shown by lessened per centage of deaths, and number of admissions." These remarks, based not upon theory, but the outcome of extensive practice and acute observation, should carry conviction to every unbiassed mind. For a list of the infected localities in your District, I beg to refer you to Table 6 in the Appendix. Sanitary Work. For a detailed account of the Sanitary work performed in the District during the year by the Inspectors, I beg to refer you to Table 7 in the Appendix. Many questions of Sanitary importance presented themselves to me for solution, and among them I may mention more particularly 10 Harris'Court and the courts in its immediate vicinity, respecting which I made a representation under the provisions of the Artisans' Dwellings' Act, to the Metropolitan Board of Works, still remain, though curtailed very materially in extent; some of the most objectionable houses have been pulled down, and a Board School and other buildings erected on the site. A portion, however, of the area comprised in my representation still remains, and is decidedly in an unhealthy condition. Brooksby's Blood Boiling Works were inspected by me on more than one occasion; the improvements introduced into these works have reduced to a minimum, if they have not entirely obviated, the nuisance originally complained of. The Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses were inspected previous to the day of licensing the same, and the Sanitary improvements required in some of them having been executed, the licences were again granted. Gun Square was found to be in a most unsatisfactory condition; ultimately the houses were pulled down and re-built. Various other localities and factories came under my personal observation during the year, among which I may mention Messrs. W. W. & R. Johnson's Lead Works; Juniper Row, Shadwell; Willow Row, Ropemakers' Fields; and certain premises in White Horse Street, ascertained to be without drainage. All these were dealt with in accordance with their respective requirements. 11 Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Eighty-two samples of articles of daily consumption were analysed during the year, viz.,23 of bread, 3 of flour, 16 of milk, 12 of tea, 7 of coffee, 3 of pepper, 6 of mustard, 2 of vinegar, 3 of arrowroot, 3 of butter, 2 of porter, and 2 of ale. All the samples of bread, flour, coffee, pepper, vinegar, arrowroot, tea, porter, and ale were genuine; 2 of the milks were adulterated with water to a slight extent; 2 of the mustards were mixed with wheaten flour. All the butters were largely adulterated with other fat. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE ARTHUR ROGERS, Medical Officer of Health, and Food Analyst.

Commercial Road, Limehouse.—The Board has again had under consideration the necessity for widening the Commercial Road between Three Colt Street and Salmon Lane, it appearing that an opportunity might present itself to widen the said road on the South side, where the new Town Hall for the parish of Limehouse was built at the corner of Church Row. I brought up a report as to the proceedings which have been taken from time to time in reference to the proposed Improvement, and stated that I was still of opinion that the Improvement should be made by widening the road at the North side, as shown upon the Plan approved by the Board in the first instance. The Board has ordered a Memorial to be presented to the Metropolitan Board of Works calling their attention to the great importance of widening the Commercial Road as a Metropolitan Improvement, and that a deputation be appointed to wait upon the Metropolitan Board in support of the Memorial; also that a communication be made to the Carriers, Wharfingers, Public Companies, and other persons inconvenienced by the narrowness of the road, calling their attention to the expediency of their memorializing the Metropolitan Board to carry out the proposed Improvement. Land adjoining Wapping Workhouse.—The purchase of the pieces of Land adjoining the Workhouse for the widening of part of Upper Well Alley has been completed, and arrangements will be made for severing the said pieces of land from the other part of the Workhouse property, and for completing the widening of the Alley. bills in parliament. Thames River (Prevention of Floods) Bill. This Bill has been before a Parliamentary Committee of the House of Commons. An objection was taken that the Metropolitan Board had not shown what they proposed to do, or what the cost would be, and the matter was adjourned in order to give the Metropolitan Board an opportunity to supplement their case by bringing further evidence, and an estimate of the cost. The Metropolitan Board afterwards withdrew the Bill, in consequence of the Select Committee haying, through their Chairman, announced that they had requested him to report to the House of Commons to the effect that they had resolved that the most equitable mode of charging and meeting the expenses to be incurred for the prevention of floods within the Metropolitan District would be that the work should be carried into effect by the Metropolitan Board, and the expenses paid by a rate levied over the whole Metropolitan area. Subsequently the Board having ascertained that the question was again under the consideration of the Metropolitan Board, I made a statement to your Board of my views on the subject, and the suggestions I considered should be made by the Board to the Metropolitan Board, so that they could be considered by that Board before they decided upon the principal of any future application to Parliament. Puplic Health (Metropolis) Bill.—A Petition was presented by order of the Board to the House of Commons against such clauses in the Bill as were intended to put the District Boards and Vestries under the control of the Local Government Board, and the Members of Parliament for the Borough of the Tower Hamlets were requested to support the Petition. Metropolis Management & Building Act Amendment Bill.—The Board has ordered a Petition to be presented against this Bill, with a view to amendments being made, so that the powers of the Metropolitan Board can be more clearly defined. Metropolis Waterworks (Purchase) Bill.—A Petition to the House of Commons was prepared by order of the Board in favor of the Bill to empower the purchase by the Metropolitan Board of the several Water Companies' undertakings, and letters were addressed to the Borough Members requesting them to support the same in the House; and such Petition was duly presented and supported by Mr. Ritchie. Thames Subway.—A Petition has been presented by order of the Board in favor of the Bill promoted in Parliament to authorize the construction of a Subway for foot passengers between Thames Place, Poplar, and Rotherhithe. high tides. With regard to the inundation of Union Stairs, Wapping, during high tides, a letter was addressed to this Board by the Metropolitan Board of Works, stating that such property was still liable to inundation at times of very high tides, and that only partial measures of prevention had been adopted by the District Board, and enquiring whether the Board were prepared to execute the further works necessary to prevent floods in future at the spot in question. In reply a letter was addressed to the Metropolitan Board, by direction of this Board, requesting to be informed of the nature and extent of the further works that Board considered necessary. Subsequently a report of the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board as to the further works considered necessary was forwarded to this Board stating that the proposed extension of the stairs would be a suitable protection of the locality from high tides in the opinion of that Board. The said report was referred to your Works Committee, and I made a report thereon to the effect that the present flap had been effectual in preventing flooding from high tides over the passage in question; that the works proposed by the Metropolitan Board if carried out would be dangerous, and likely to cause serious accidents to persons using the stairs; and that there would be opposition on the part of the adjoining Wharf eccumers to the proposed projection into the river. Also that in the Plans submitted by the Metropolitan Board's Engineer to the Parliamentary Committee on the Thames Flooding Bill in the late Session, a large number of private properties were proposed to be dealt with to prevent flooding by means of the moveable flaps or shutters, and were not of a permanent character. By order of the Board, the substance of my report was communicated to the Metropolitan Board of Works. proposed communication between north & south of thames. A letter was addressed to this Board by Mr. Turner, Clerk to the Board of Works for the Whitechapel District, stating that the following resolution had been passed by that Board :— " That an application be made to the Metropolitan Board by "Memorial, under seal, to urge upon that body the necessity "of a bridge being formed over the Thames, and that the "Vestries and District Boards interested in the matter be "invited to adopt a similar course." Subsequently a Memorial to the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had been prepared by order of the Whitechapel District Board, was forwarded to this Board, accompanied by a letter requesting the co-operation of this Board. In reply, a letter was addressed to the Whitechapel District Board stating that, although this Board is of opinion that there should be some additional communication between the North and South sides of the River East of London Bridge, at the present time the Board does not possess sufficient information on the subject to justify joining in the Memorial to the Metropolitan Board as suggested by the Whitechapel District Board. whitechapel hay market. A letter has been addressed to this Board by Mr. Jutsum, Clerk to the Vestry of Mile End Old Town, accompanied by a copy Memorial of that Vestry to the Metropolitan Board of Works, praying that Board to remove the Whitechapel Hay Market, and requesting that if the Board concurred with the views of the Vestry, the Metropolitan Board might be informed of the fact; and, by order of this Board, a letter was addressed to the Metropolitan Board of Works in favour of the removal of the Hay Market. metropolitan fire brigade. The Board having considered the report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, passed a resolution protesting against the management of the Brigade being taken from the Metropolitan Board of Works, in order that it may be placed in the charge of a Governmental Department; and that in the event of the Metropolitan Board being required to incur a further expenditure in extending the Brigade, the Fire Insurance Companies should be required to contribute in a larger degree than they do at present towards such expenditure. Copies of such resolution were sent to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and to the Borough and County Members, with a request that in the event of a Bill being brought in to effect the proposed transfer, they will use their utmost exertions to prevent its becoming law. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, CHARLES DUNCH, Surveyor of the Board.
