MAYOR, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I have the honour to present the 70th Annual Report on the health and circumstances of the population of the Borough of Southall. The standard of health amongst the population was good in 1960. There was a rise in the birth rate and a fall in the infant mortality rate. This figure was the lowest ever recorded in the Borough. The number of notifications of cases of tuberculosis was decreased. There was little infection, no poliomyelitis, no diphtheria and no outbreaks of infectious disease or food poisoning. There was, however, a rise in the death rate, principally amongst late middle aged and elderly people suffering from coronary diseases; these showed a steep rise during the year. There was some increase in the number of illegitimate babies born and in the number of premature infants born. Immunisation against infectious diseases was continued by the various authorities and the only disappointing figure amongst these is that of smallpox vaccination; this has again fallen. It is disquieting to have to report an increase in the amount of supervision and treatment required for verminous infestations of school children. The amount of voluntary welfare work in the Borough is very great and increasing, particularly with regard to the improving of the social life and mental health of the elderly. Southall now has a sizeable coloured immigrant population, and it is satisfactory 5 to note that the social life of these people is being integrated gradually if very slowly with the social activities of the rest of the community, and that the Indian Workers Association shows a keen interest in the obtaining and distribution of health information and teaching. The implementation of the Clean Air Act has meant that an enormous amount of work has to be carried out in the inspection of houses and in the helping of citizens to understand their rights and duties when they live in an area under a Smoke Control Order. An exceptionally wet year with periods of heavy storm resulted in short periods of flooding in a few parts of the Borough, and as a result the Borough Council concentrated on an increase in the provision of surface water and sewage disposal facilities. Housing and the overcrowding of houses still remained a problem in 1960. There is very little spare land available for building within the Borough, and so Council rehousing of overcrowded families still can proceed only very slowly, while the transfer of families to the New Towns becomes also very difficult as these towns begin to reach saturation point. The year was a satisfactory one with regard to the hygiene of food. This can be judged by the fact that food poisoning was confined to one patient only and on only three occasions were articles of unsound food brought to the Public Health Department. The figures supplied by the County Control Officer also showed good results for the sampling of food from shops in Southall or from multiple stores or manufacturers whose products are sold in Southall. In spite of all the health education, national and local, it seems very difficult to educate the public against the throwing about of litter and waste food, and to this can be attributed the fact that the amount of work required for the control of rats and mice was increased during 1960. Persons who carelessly throw waste food about in streets and public places, who leave dustbins half open or with food strewn around, and owners of private premises, shops or factories who do not exercise sufficient care in the storage of food need to realise that the killing of flies and of rodents is not the best method of preventing the illnesses which can result from their presence. The only safe and sure way is to give no opportunity for them to breed, and in the absence of food they will not breed. I would like to thank the members of the staff of the Public Health Department for all the work they do during the year and in the preparation of this report, and for their loyal support at all times. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. Manor House, Southall. Telephone Numbers: SOU 3621-2.

Because of its comparative modernity it has no large areas of slum property, and although there are some streets where the houses are inadequate by modern standards, the structure is sound. Although it is satisfactory that this should be so, for the health of the occupants, the presence of streets of inadequate houses prevents, in a district very short of vacant land, much possibility of redevelopment on any substantial scale. Already land in two neighbouring boroughs has had to be used for Council House building to assist with the 9 housing needs of the people and use is also made of New Town housing. The estimated population has been considered to be falling each year since the last Census, but with the increase in multi-occupation of houses, combined with the fact that very few houses have been demolished compared to the number built, it will be interesting to get the Census figure from the 1961 count. The factories sited in the Borough include large food factories and engineering works, chemical works, paint, dye and woodworks, manufacturing chemists, laundries, etc. No scheduled offensive trades are at present carried on in Southall. Unemployment has not been a problem in Southall. Figures obtained by courtesy of the Manager of the Southall Employment Exchange and the Youth Employment Officer are as follows:— Men Women Number of persons registered as unemployed at Southall Employment Exchange on 12th December, 1960 122 50 Number of unfilled vacancies as at 7th December, 1960 267 64 On 12th December, 1960, one girl and five boys were registered as unemployed. On 7th December, 1960, 77 boys' vacancies and 61 girls' vacancies were unfilled. Swimming Bath The Southall Borough Council maintains an outdoor swimming pool in the Recreation Ground, which is one of the public parks, and this pool is used very fully during the summer months. The surface area of the bath is 3,600 square feet (120 feet by 30 feet). cubic capacity 16,500 cubic feet (110,000 gallons). The water is treated by break point chlorination and the normal chlorine content of 1.0 parts per million at the shallow end and 0.7 at the deep end is maintained. During peak periods this is increased to 4.0 parts per million at the shallow end in order to obtain 2.0 parts per million at the deep end. A minimum of three samples of the water are taken daily by the staff of the Baths Superintendent for chlorine and other chemical testing, and from time to time bacteriological testing is carried out by officers from the Public Health Department. At no time during 1960 was the water found to be unsatisfactory for use by swimmers. As this bath is closed during the winter months it can be fully emptied and repaired, if necessary, and cleansed each year before the spring opening. During 1960 the total number of persons using the bath was 29,242 (61,277 in 1959). The average number of persons attending per day was 192. The maximum number at any one session was 300. The attendance during 1960, although half that for the previous year, was very good considering how cold and wet the whole summer season was. Swimming, a most healthful exercise, increases in popularity each year amongst the young people of Southall. Paddling Pool A paddling pool for young children is available in Cranleigh Gardens Play Park The capacity of the pool is approximately 15,500 gallons with depth from 1½ inches to 9 inches. The water of the pool is free running and is treated by continuous chlorination for hygiene purposes. Like the swimming bath, this pool was in constant and very full use during the summer of 1960. Bacteriological sampling when carried out gave satisfactory results. School Playing Fields For the physical training, school games and recreation of school children the total acreage of school playing fields in Southall is approximately 22. At present considerable use is also made of the play parks within the Council's public parks and negotiations are still proceeding for the acquisition of three further areas of land suitable for playing fields. 10 VITAL STATISTICS Total Deaths, 699. (Males, 352: Females, 347.) Crude Death Rate, 13.15. For extracts from vital statistics and causes of death, see Appendix, Tables I and II. Deaths and Death Rate The death rate, i.e. the number of deaths per 1,000 total population, rose again in 1960. Below is shown the comparative figures for the past eight years. Year Death Rate 1953 13.31 1954 12.16 1955 11.92 1956 12.25 1957 13.02 1958 12.04 1959 12.12 1960 13.15 The three principal causes of death were coronary disease, cancer, and heart disease —in that order. The rise in deaths from coronary disease is very steep—156 in 1960, 114 in 1959. Heart diseases rose also from 83 in 1959 to 111 in 1960, but the rise in deaths from cancer was small, from 115 to 118 and the figure for lung cancer deaths fell again, being 38 in 1958, 36 in 1959 and 31 in 1960. There were no deaths from whooping cough, diphtheria, poliomyelitis or influenza. There were five deaths from tuberculosis. The number of outside deaths, i.e. of Southall residents who died in Hillingdon Hospital, other Middlesex hospitals and hospitals outside the County boundaries, including various London hospitals, was 282 (males 166 and females 116). Deaths of institution inmates (including patients from Southall addresses and from outside areas) number as follows: St. Bernard's Hospital, 178 (males 62 and females 116); Mount Pleasant Hospital, 24 (8 male and 16 female); Southall-Norwood Hospital, 8 (2 male and 6 female); Vine Cottage, 4 (3 male and 1 female); in addition 3 deaths (1 male and 2 female) occurred of persons belonging to other districts and residing temporarily in Southall. In 1960, nine people died as the result of motor vehicle accidents, as compared with five in 1959. It is regrettable that there has not been a year free from motor vehicle accident deaths since 1954. The total number of deaths from violent causes was recorded as 39 in 1960 as compared with 30 in 1959. To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that of England and Wales as a whole, the crude death rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. This, then, gives a comparative death rate of 12.10, compared with the rate for England and Wales as a whole, which was 11.5. For distribution of deaths in the various wards, see Appendix, Table III. Births and Birth Rate. (Figures for 1959 are given in brackets.) The total number of registered births in the district (as notified under the Births and Deaths Registration Act) was 184 (171). The total number of live births belonging to the district, whether occurring within or outside the district, was 817 (743). The illegitimate live births were 66 (55). There were 22 stillbirths (10), 11 legitimate, 11 illegitimate. A rise in the birth rate (live and still) is recorded from 14.23 in 1959 to 15.58 in 1960. The birth rate is the number of births per 1,000 of the total population. 11 Sixty-six illegitimate live births were registered during 1960. The following table shows the comparative figures for the past 25 years, showing that 1960 has the highest figure recorded during that period. No. of Illegitimate Year Live Births 1936 24 1937 38 1938 31 1939 34 1940 31 1941 30 1942 38 1943 39 1944 55 1945 60 1946 56 1947 53 1948 53 1949 39 1950 36 1951 28 1952 26 1953 31 1954 23 1955 21 1956 38 1957 37 1958 42 1959 55 1960 66 To make an approximate allowance for the way in which the sex and age distribution of the local population differs from that for England and Wales as a whole, the birth rate is multiplied by a comparability factor supplied by the Registrar-General. The corrected live birth rate was 15.98. The corresponding rate for the whole of England and Wales was 17.1 and this was the highest birth rate since the year 1948. Infant Mortality Infant mortality, i.e. the number of children dying before reaching the age of one year, improved in 1960. Fourteen infants died compared with seventeen in 1959, giving a rate of 17.14 compared with 22.88 in 1959. This is the lowest infant mortality rate ever recorded in the Borough—the nearest to it being 17-19 in 1955. Of these 14 deaths, 2 died at home and 12 in hospital. Twelve infants (8 male and 4 female) died within the first four weeks after birth. Table V gives the causes of infant deaths under the age of one year. Graph A, on infant mortality rates, shows the trend of the infant mortality rate since 1900. The infant mortality rate for Middlesex County was 18.6 and the infant mortality rate for England and Wales as a whole was 21.7, the lowest ever recorded in this country. The Southall figure is well below both the County and the National rates. 12 13 Premature Infants Sixty premature infants were born alive during the year; 45 were born in hospital and of these, 38 were surviving at the end of one month; 13 were born at home and all of these were surviving at the end of one month. There were eight premature stillbirths, seven occurring in hospital and one at home. The classification of a premature infant is given to a child born prematurely, or which weighs less than 5½ lbs. at birth. The figures for premature births and stillbirths are both showing an upward trend, the corresponding figures in 1959 were 55 premature live births and 7 premature stillbirths. Maternal Morbidity Two cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified during the year. In addition, 17 mothers from Southall were notified to other authorities as having developed puerperal pyrexia in hospital, i.e. 4 in Perivale Maternity Hospital, 13 in Hillingdon Hospital. There was one maternal death, and no deaths associated with abortion. 14 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The number of infectious disease cases notified during 1960 was quite small, and notifications were from scattered districts and also scattered throughout the year— evidence of a good state of resistance, particularly of the child population and probably a result of the beneficent wonderful summer weather of 1959. The only figure showing any noticeable increase was that for dysentery, though the figure was not large, nor was there any outbreak. No cases of diphtheria were notified, and no cases of poliomyelitis. Monthly Bulletins of Incidence of Infectious Disease These bulletins were circulated monthly to all general practitioners in the Borough, and, in addition to information with regard to infectious diseases occurring during the previous month, any topical matter, or incident of mutual interest to general practitioners and the Public Health Service, was also included. Measles Measles incidence was very slight during the year 1960. There were no deaths from measles. The following table shows the trend of notifications during the past ten years. Year No. of Cases Deaths 1951 1,129 - 1952 528 - 1953 931 1 1954 41 - 1955 1,329 - 1956 61 - 1957 674 1 1958 476 - 1959 674 - 1960 12 - Poliomyelitis No notifications of anterior poliomyelitis were received in 1960. Vaccination against poliomyelitis, which is organised by Middlesex County Health Department, continued throughout 1960, and details are as follows:— Number of persons who had received two injections at any time up to 31st December, 1960 15,850 Number of persons who received three injections during 1960 4,618 Number of persons who received two injections during 1960 2,783 Of those previously obtaining two injections, by the end of December, 13,295 had received three injections. The giving of fourth injections was planned to start early in 1961. Influenza Influenza was not a serious problem during 1960, and no deaths from this disease were recorded. Dysentery Fifty-three notifications of dysentery were received in 1960. Although this is up on the 1959 figure—the cases were all isolated or in family groups only—no outbreak occurred. Of these, 31 were confirmed as caused by Shigella Sonnei, two as Shigella Flexnerii. Two cases notified as suspected dysentery were subsequently confirmed as Shigella Sonnei cases, and two notified as gastro-enteritis were subsequently confirmed as Sonne Dysentery. 15 Smallpox (Variola) No cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough during the year. In October, we were notified that a passenger, who had landed at London Airport apparently well, had subsequently developed smallpox. Subsequent to his arrival in England he had visited many places and we were supplied with lists of possible contacts. 161 visits were paid by Public Health Inspectors on following up this information. No infection occurred. Vaccination against Smallpox The total figures for vaccination showed a drop in 1960. The percentage of children receiving vaccination during their first year of life, having risen from 45 in 1957 to 52 in 1958 and again to reach 55 in 1959, it is disappointing to have to record a fall in 1960 to 50 %. 1960 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 410 44 15 26 39 534 Re-vaccination 4 13 132 149 1959 Age Group Under 1 year 1-2 years 2-4 years 5-14 years 15 years and over Total Primary Vaccination 412 33 29 29 45 548 Re-vaccination — 4 12 117 133 Scarlet Fever (Scarlatina) The number of notifications received during the year was 42 as compared with 124 for the previous year. There were two secondary cases, i.e. occurring within three weeks following the notification of a previous case in the same household. In addition, two children had an individual second attack of Scarlatina, and in two other families two children developed the illness simultaneously. Diphtheria No cases of diphtheria were notified to the Department. The following information supplied by the Area Medical Officer shows the number of children immunised against diphtheria during the year. Number of Children who completed a full course of Primary Immunisation in Southall during the year Number of Children who were given Secondary or Reinforcing Injection during the year (i.e. having in a Ages at Date of Final Injection previous year received a complete full course) Under 1 1-4 5-14 Total 621 128 17 766 159 16 In the following table is shown the number of children at 31st December, 1960, who had completed a course of immunisation against diphtheria at any time before that date:— Age at 31.12.60 Under 1 5-9 10-14 Total under 15 Number immunised 288 2,145 2,565 3,721 8,719 The immunisation state of the child population has improved during the year, all the figures showing an increase on 1959. Ophthalmia Neonatorum No case of ophthalmia neonatorum was notified during the year. Tuberculosis Notifications Pulmonary The number of new cases notified during the year was 61. Other Forms The number of new cases notified during the year was 10. Of the total notifications, which include new cases and inward transfers from other districts, 49 were received from the Uxbridge Chest Clinic; 10 from General Hospitals; and 12 from St. Bernard's Hospital. The number of new notifications dropped from 85 in 1959 to 71 in 1960. Of the 71, 24 were inward transfers, i.e. they were not resident in Southall at the time of development of the disease, and, therefore, the actual figure of new notifications of Southall residents was 47, one of which was subsequently diagnosed as non-tuberculous; while in 1959 the number of inward transfers was 21, making the figure for new notifications of Southall residents 64, less two subsequently cancelled. Deaths Tuberculosis of the respiratory system, 5; other forms, nil. For details of new cases notified and deaths in 1960, see Appendix Table IX, and for the occupation of new cases see Appendix, Table X. Public Health (Prevention of Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1925 Public Health Act, 1936, Section 172 Action under these powers was not necessary during the year. Although the notification rate for tuberculosis was lower, there was an increase in the number of deaths from this disease—5 in 1960 compared with 2 in 1959. The amount of tuberculosis amongst Indian residents rose in 1960, comparative figures for the last four years are:— New Number Year Notifications of Indians 1960 47 13 1959 64 12 1958 57 14 1957 61 10 The analysis of the housing conditions of new cases (of notified patients living in Southall, exclusive of St. Bernard's Hospital notifications) shows in three cases statutory 17 18 overcrowding, and in one case, a dilapidated dwelling. No abatement of the overcrowding had been obtained by the end of 1960. In seven instances there were secondary cases, in two of these the newly notified patient was the third in the family to develop the disease, and in one the new patient was the second in the household, but the sixth in the patient's family. Although the home in this case was not statutorily overcrowded, there was bedroom overcrowding, and the special circumstances were put forward for consideration by the Council's Housing Committee. Of the two cases of overcrowding during 1959, one patient moved to another address outside the district during 1960, and in the other case the diagnosis was not sustained. Of the two cases of overcrowding remaining during 1958, one patient moved to another address outside the district during 1960. The remaining case is still at the same address. Management of Tuberculosis For diagnostic purposes, Southall patients are mostly referred either by general practitioners or from hospital doctors to the Uxbridge Chest Clinic, and if tuberculosis is found treatment and following-up is instituted from that Clinic. The Tuberculosis Visitor calls at the home of a patient and submits a copy of her report to the Public Health Department. Contacts are seen by the Visitor and they have suitable tests, either tuberculin tests or X-rays, or both, at the Chest Clinic. If sanitary defects or overcrowding are reported further visiting is carried out from the Public Health Department. At St. Bernard's Hospital, cases of tuberculosis are isolated in Adelaide Ward, which has 24 male and 24 female beds. One of the doctors from Uxbridge Chest Clinic continues to carry out tuberculin testing and B.C.G. vaccination of members of the nursing staff of the hospital. B.C.G. Vaccination B.C.G. vaccination is offered to contacts of cases of tuberculosis, to medical and nursing staffs of tuberculosis wards, and since 1957, as a result of the findings of the Medical Research Council in their Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial, to children aged 13 and over in Southall schools. Testing with tuberculin is carried out beforehand. The tuberculin test, if positive, shows that infection has occurred at some time during life, and further investigation is undertaken to verify whether this is active, chronic or healed infection, as these all give the same result to the test. When the tuberculin test is negative and in the absence of disease, B.C.G. inoculations are carried out in order to render the individuals tuberculin positive and, therefore, to have immunity to infection by the tuberculous bacillus. Details of work on Southall contacts during 1960 at Uxbridge Chest Clinic are as follows:— Under 1 year 1^1 5-15 Over 15 Total Tuberculin tests—Positive result - 2 26 114 142 Tuberculin tests—Negative result 34 35 51 21 141 B.C.G. given 34 35 51 2 147 B.C.G. given—Babies born in hospital — — — 6 Most of the "over 15" were Indians. 19 Under the B.C.G. vaccination in schools scheme, details are as follows:— Number invited to take part in the scheme Number of consents received Referred to Chest Clinic Number of children vaccinated with B.C.G. Contacts j Positives 883 629 9 173 365 All testing and vaccinating during 1960 under this scheme was carried out in Southall by the Middlesex County Council staff. Tuberculosis Vaccines Clinical Trial In August, 1960, the Medical Research Council's Vaccines Trial was completed. The final analysis seemed to show conclusively that B.C.G. vaccination confers a very substantial protection against tuberculosis, and this protection persists for at least 7½ years after being given. Vaccination of school children should therefore contribute very substantially to the reduction of tuberculosis in adolescents and young adults. Mass X-ray The mobile Mass X-ray Unit visited certain organised groups in Southall during 1960 and the following numbers were X-rayed:— A.E.C 3,951 North Thames Gas Board 330 Quaker Oats Ltd. 754 Cramic Engineering Co. 448 Wimpey Depots 363 5,846 Four active cases and three observation cases of pulmonary tuberculosis were discovered and two cases of lung cancer. No ex-school leavers were X-rayed in 1960. There is now available at the West Middlesex Hospital a static Mass X-ray Unit, the second to be introduced in Middlesex, and while primarily intended for the use of hospital patients, there is an open invitation for any member of the public to attend at any time when the Unit is working, for a check. This is a most useful undertaking and supplements the work done during the visits of the Mobile Unit to Southall. It also saves the need, in most cases, of reference by appointment to the Chest X-ray Clinic for a large film to be taken. Dr. J. T. Nicol Roe, Chest Physician, Uxbridge Chest Clinic, reports that, in spite of the steady diminution of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, it still remains a considerable public health problem which must continue to be attacked by all means at our disposal. There is no doubt that treatment is best carried out in hospital, especially in the early stages. The stay in hospital is less than was necessary some years ago. The taking of anti-tuberculous drugs must continue for a few years and it is most important that they are taken conscientiously. Dr. Nicol Roe also states that the need for the X-ray and tuberculin testing in Indian immigrants continues and urges that efforts should be made to encourage a visit to the Chest Clinic by every new Indian resident in Southall. It is important also that those found to be tuberculin negative should return for B.C.G. vaccination, and in support of 20 this he submits the following figures, which refer only to Indians sent to the Clinic by their general practitioners. Under 1 year 1-4 5-15 Over 15 Total Tested - 1 23 208 232 Negative — 1 8 60 69 Positive — — 4 112 116 Vaccinated — 1 8 60 69 Of those originally skin tested, 47 failed to return to the Clinic for reading of the test. With regard to prevention and early detection of cases, contacts both at home and factory or workshop should have regular X-rays and/or Tuberculin Tests. Full use should continue to be made of the Mass X-ray Unit's visits to the Borough. Cancer It will be seen by the table of causes of death (page 55) that in 1960 118 cases (70 males and 48 females) died from cancer. See Appendix, Table VI, for an analysis of cancer deaths since 1936. Overleaf is set out in tabular form a classification of the cancer deaths according to the site of the primary growth and in ages. The total number of deaths from cancer in 1960 rose, being 118 as compared with 115 in 1959. Cancer of the lung in males, still the highest individual figure for site of disease, was three less than in 1959, and five less than in 1958. Distribution of Infectious Disease Notifications For the incidence of various infectious diseases notified during the year, under age groups and locality, see Appendix, Tables VII and VIII. Infectious Disease Visits During the year, the Public Health Inspectors paid 405 visits with reference to cases of infectious disease. In addition, the County Health Visitors did a certain amount of home and school visiting in connection with infectious diseases. Laboratory Work Specimens taken for bacteriological or chemical investigations, in connection particularly with infectious disease cases, are brought daily to the Manor House and transported to the Ealing Public Health Laboratory. The necessary investigations are carried out and results reported simultaneously to the Medical Officer of Health and to the doctor who has submitted the specimen from one of his patients. Details of the work carried out in 1960 are as follows:— Faeces specimens 421 Sputum specimens 4 Blood specimens 29 Urine specimens 43 Swabs (nose, throat and vaginal) 51 Papilloma 1 Fluid from mouth 1 Disinfection and Disinfestation In cases of infectious disease, rooms, clothing, etc., were disinfected—rooms by 21 22 CLASSIFICATION OF CANCER DEATHS IN SITES AND AGES Age Groups—Male Site Total Under 10 10—20 20—30 30—40 40—50 50—60 60—70 70—80 80 + '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 *59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 ''58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 Lung 24 33 31 28 - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 - - - 2 1 3 5 12 15 11 13 7 8 9 5 8 7 5 1 1 - - Stomach 6 16 13 9 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 4 3 1 - 5 5 3 2 6 5 5 - 1 - - Intestine 9 13 6 7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - j 1 1 3 2 2 1 - 7 2 3 3 2 — — 3 1 1 2 Bladder 1 3 5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 2 - 1 2 - 1 1 1 - - — - - Prostate - 4 2 6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 2 - 2 1 2 - - 1 1 Other 18 22 8 20 - - - - 1 1 - - 1 1 - - 3 2 - 2 2 1 2 3 2 6 2 5 - - 3 7 2 7 "~ 1 2 1 1 2 Totals 58 91 65 70 - - - - 1 1 - - 1 1 - - 3 5 - 2 2 4 4 7 11 25 24 19 21 25 20 24 13 2 14 13 6 4 3 5 Age Groups—Female Site Under 10 10—20 20—30 30—40 40—50 50—60 60—70 70—80 80 + '57 '58 59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 ''59 '60 '57 '58 ''59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 ''59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 '57 '58 '59 '60 Breast 10 10 5 8 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - 2 4 3 1 5 - - 2 - 4 4 - - - 3 2 1 Lung 7 5 5 3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 2 - 1 - 2 2 - 1 - - 3 2 1 2 1 - 2 1 — - Stomach 3 5 9 6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 1 - 1 2 3 2 2 2 2 - 2 4 - Uterus 4 1 2 - — - - — — - - — — — — — — — — — 1 — - — 1 — 1 — - 1 — — — — 1 3 — — — — Intestine 13 8 11 9 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 2 3 — 1 3 1 3 3 5 3 5 4 2 1 3 - Bladder - - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - - - Other 18 19 17 19 - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 - 1 1 - - 1 1 3 1 5 6 6 2 - - 4 5 5 4 2 7 1 4 1 4 Totals 55 48 50 48 - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 - 1 1 - - 7 1 4 4 14 14 9 10 10 6 14 13 17 15 12 16 5 11 10 5 sealing and fumigating with a formalin preparation; clothing, bedding and other infected articles remaining in the room for disinfection.

Smallpox Disinfection In the event of smallpox occurring within the district and disinfection being required on a considerable scale, arrangements have been made whereby this could be carried out. An agreement was made with the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board whereby in such an event the staff of St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge, would carry out this work. Provision of Antitoxin and Vaccine Lymph The Council provides diphtheria antitoxin free to local practitioners in the district. This antitoxin is obtained from the Public Health Department during office hours and by direct request to the Medical Officer of Health at other times. In the event of emergency supplies of vaccine lymph being required, they are obtainable at very short notice. Scabies and Lice During 1960, five cases of infestation with scabies and one of pediculosis pubis, and one alleged to be verminous but no vermin found, were brought to the Public Health Department for cleansing. Baths and treatment were arranged at Hammersmith Cleansing Station by courtesy of Hammersmith Borough Council. Table XI gives details of head inspections in schools. The number of inspections during 1960 was nearly double those of 1959, and showed a heavy increase in the number of infestations. This deterioration shows the need for continuous vigilance, and that the louse is still an insect to be reckoned with. It is to be hoped that all adult contacts of infested school children submit themselves for examination and treatment, as was the case when there was a Cleansing Station in Southall. 23 WELFARE GENERAL St. John Ambulance Association: The local headquarters of the St. John Ambulance Association are situated at Hartington Road, Southall, and the honorary officers are Dr. Mary Ellis, of Lansdowne House, High Street, Harlington, Divisional Surgeon; Miss E. Hobson, 20, Elmfield Road, Southall, Divisional Superintendent, Nursing Division, and Mr. W. Adams, 98, Carlyle Avenue, Southall, Divisional Superintendent, Ambulance Division. There are 23 Nursing Members, 4 Officers, and 16 Auxiliary Members. The work carried out is as follows:— Home Nursing and Nursing Equipment. The St. John Ambulance Nursing Division has been trained in Home Nursing and First Aid to the Injured. It also lends Nursing equipment for use in the home from the Medical Comforts Depot in Hartington Road, open every evening (except Sundays and Bank Holidays) from 7.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. for the issue of articles needed by the public. During the year 370 articles were lent under the scheme—the 1959 figure was 435. Welfare—General. The St. John Ambulance Brigade carried out trainings in First Aid and Home Nursing for all who cared to take advantage of the service, also special courses for Civil Defence Volunteers and for Scouts and Guides. The members of the Nursing and Ambulance Divisions carried out many other duties including attendance at local cinemas, sports, fairs, Old Folks' Clubs, accompanying old people's group excursions to the seaside, Hospital duties, also Sick Visiting. Members also took part in duties further afield, including London Airport, London theatres, concerts, etc. The amount of voluntary time given to this good work is great and increasing. During 1960, 1,233 hours were spent on Public Duties, 193 on Hospital Duties and 308 on Miscellaneous Duties. British Red Cross Society: The Southall Division of the British Red Cross Society made good progress in 1960, and membership rose to 136. The Girls' Cadet Unit increased, and seven members qualified to receive Proficiency medals in First Aid. The "New Members" Group did very well throughout the year, and provided interesting work for those ladies who had some spare time, and who liked to work for the Red Cross, but on non.medical work, without the need to take examinations and wear uniforms. A new mixed Detachment was formed in June. The first course of Mental Health lectures to be held in Southall was given by the new Detachment's Nursing Superintendent, also Principal Tutor at St. Bernard's Hospital. The Disabled People's Handcraft Club had also an increased membership, and much pleasure was derived for the housebound by their weekly visits to this Club. The Red Cross assisted in the after.care of patients from Mental Hospitals, by accepting suitable ones as members of the Handcraft Club. Other activities by the Southall Division included Training and Instruction in First Aid and Nursing, Mental Health and Welfare work, visiting, Medical Loan Depot (332 loans were made in 1960). Escort duties, transport for the sick, clerical work and assistance at all National Blood Transfusion sessions, Handcraft Club for the Disabled, after.care and emergency help for disabled ex.servicemen, First Aid duties at the local Rugby football ground and the London Festival Hall, assistance as casualties and "casualty fakers " at Territorial and Civil Defence exercises at the Hayes training ground. Club for Disabled Persons: A Club, for persons suffering from severe disablement, met weekly and was a social 24 and recreational one for people suffering from any physical handicap. Transport was provided by members of the Rotary Club and Round Table for those members who were unable to make their own way to the Club premises, which were at the Southall Community Centre. The membership remained at a figure of 25—the average attendance being about 18. Members make themselves useful to the Community Centre staff in little ways, and this is of considerable therapeutic value. The Hard of Hearing Club: This Club, which was inaugurated in 1955, had another successful year in 1960 and continued to be popular and useful to its members. The membership figure rose to 45 with an average weekly attendance of 30—35. The Committee is very energetic and the programmes arranged for the members were varied, interesting and often directly useful in helping them to come to terms with their disability. The Welfare Committee of the Southall Group had numerous calls for services—assistance was given for all who needed such service. Five members attended the Old Age Pensioners' Holiday at Dymchurch organised by the Welfare Committee of the Middlesex & Surrey League, and the group was represented at numerous conferences sponsored by the League, and by the British Association of the Hard of Hearing, during the year. This club has a difficult task as the Hard of Hearing often tend to remain aloof, and are nervous of mixing with others. Once the ice is broken they prove to be good members of the group and attend regularly. Diabetic Club: The Club for Diabetics, started in 1956, continued to function throughout 1960. This Club was founded to enable sufferers from diabetes as well as those interested in diabetes, i.e. for relatives or friends of diabetics, to meet together socially and to have the opportunity to discuss their individual problems with fellow sufferers and to hear authoritative talks from speakers particularly interested in diabetes such as doctors and other nutrition and health experts. The membership was 45 and the attendance at monthly meetings averaged about 23 but altogether some 135 diabetics have enjoyed the benefits of the club since its formation. Home Advice Group: This Group, created for the purpose of assisting and advising mothers with problems, continued to function throughout the year. Meetings were held weekly at first at the Work Centre for the Elderly in the Municipal Sports Ground, later in the year the meeting place was changed to Northcote Clinic. A programme of interesting discussions, demonstrations and specialist speakers was carried out during the year. The Group is assisted financially by the Housing Committee of the Borough Council and is under the direction of a Co.ordinating Committee of officials of the various bodies concerned with welfare of the family. The membership at the end of the year was 12, with an average attendance of 8. Welfare of the Blind and Partially Sighted: The welfare services for blind and partially.sighted are the responsibility of the County Council under the National Assistance Act, 1948. The County Council's Welfare Department provides a Home Teaching service, the object of which is to enable blind and partially.sighted people to lead as full and active lives as their handicap allows, by assisting them in overcoming the effects of their disabilities. The Home Teachers visit all blind and partially.sighted persons in their own homes, hospitals and residential homes, advise on all problems relating to their welfare and keep them in touch with available social services. Instruction is given in Braille and Moon systems of raised type, in handcrafts and where appropriate, in the Deaf.Blind manual 25 alphabet. A handcraft class is held fortnightly at the King's Hall Methodist Church, South Road, Southall. Close co.operation is maintained between the County Council and Voluntary Organisations including the Social Club for the Blind, which holds fortnightly meetings at the Labour Hall, The Broadway, Southall, and the Middlesex Association for the Blind who maintain a holiday home at Littlehampton, two Residential Homes for the Blind, and assist individual necessitous blind people. Blind persons are eligible for the loan of a wireless receiver through the British Wireless for the Blind Fund, and the County Council has a scheme for assisting blind and partially.sighted persons with the maintenance of wireless sets. Other services are provided by the County Council either directly or through a registered agency and these include facilities for the placement of blind persons in employment, courses of residential rehabilitation, training courses for mothers with blind babies, the supply of embossed literature, special equipment and handcraft materials, assistance in the disposal of handcrafts and assisted holidays for those in need. In 1960, there were resident in the Borough 103 blind and 15 partially.sighted persons. Two blind persons were training, and 12 were in full.time employment. Of these one was in a Workshop for the Blind, and one was working as a Home Worker. Those employed in Workshops or as Home Workers had their earnings augmented by the County Council. The majority of blind persons are not available for, or not capable of, training and employment owing to age or some other reason. Welfare of Handicapped Persons other than Blind: Schemes for the welfare of handicapped persons other than blind and partially.sighted which are operated by the County Council's Welfare Department under the National Assistance Act, 1948, provide welfare services for the deaf and dumb and hard of hearing, and other persons who are substantially and permantently handicapped by disease, injury, or congenital deformity. Services to the deaf and dumb and the hard of hearing are provided by appropriate Voluntary Organisations, to whom the County Council makes grants in aid. The Borough of Southall forms part of Area 9 which includes also the Boroughs of Brentford & Chiswick and Heston & Isleworth. Two Welfare Visitors and a Homework Organiser are included in the staff which has been provided by the County Council's Welfare Department for carrying out the social services required and who visit those suffering from substantial and permanent handicaps. They work from the local Area Welfare Office and the handicapped persons are visited in their own homes with a view to assisting them to obtain services from statutory or voluntary sources (or both). The County Council supplies aids and appliances not covered by the National Health Service, carries out where necessary adaptations to a house to enable a handicapped person to become more mobile, provides holidays, arranges for the disabled to take part in social activities, including choral and dancing classes, attend handcraft classes, etc. A special coach with an hydraulic hoist to lift wheelchair cases was approved during the year and will be available in 1961. Advice and guidance regarding personal problems are given and membership of voluntary organisations catering for particular handicaps is facilitated. The Home Work Organiser endeavours to procure from Industry appropriate assembly work and arranges for this to be carried out by handicapped persons where this is considered to be suitable and of assistance to the individuals concerned. At 31st December, 1960, 119 residents of the Borough were registered as generally handicapped. Residents of the Borough needing any of the County Welfare Services briefly referred to in this Report should apply to the Area Welfare Officer, at the Local County Offices, Great West Road, Brentford. 26 Nutrition of school children: For many years mid.morning milk and meals for school children have been provided in Southall state schools. This is a most important welfare provision, particularly as the mid.day dinners are designed carefully to supply an adequate balanced meal once a day. The value of these provisions is particularly great for children who have to travel some distance to school as it prevents the hurried consumption and digestion of food when a considerable part of the meal break has to be spent in going to and from school, and there is no doubt that children very often are least difficult about food when they eat communally. Provided school canteens are well maintained and great care is taken over the handling of the food there is undoubted benefit to be obtained from the school meals service. It is interesting to see from figures kindly supplied by the Divisional Education Officer the details of milk and meals acceptance in the various schools in the Borough. Unfortunately, there seems to be a reduction in the number of children taking school milk—the reduction though small in the primary section is considerable in the others. The poor figure for the Grammar School is noteworthy. The percentage of children having milk in schools is as follows:— 1959 1960 Primary 97% 96% Secondary Modern 85% 72% Technical 83.3% 75% Grammar 41.1% 39% Talbot Special 92.5% 83.5% The percentages of meals served to daily attendances:— %of Attendance taking meals Autumn Term Average Number taking meals Average Attendance 195S 1960 1959 1960 1959 1960 Primary Schools: Beaconsfield Road Junior Mixed 45 44 104 108 229 244 Beaconsfield Road Infants' 47 48 76 76 163 157 Clifton Road Junior Mixed 36 42 65 67 183 161 Clifton Road Infants' 35 45 36 44 103 97 Dormers Wells Junior Mixed 59 55 133 115 226 209 Dormers Wells Infants' 55 58 85 89 154 153 Featherstone Road Junior Mixed 32 35 95 102 296 288 Featherstone Road Infants' 36 43 80 92 220 212 George Tomlinson Junior Mixed 56 64 145 150 258 235 George Tomlinson Infants' 50 50 57 59 115 117 Lady Margaret Junior Mixed 49 51 171 163 350 319 Lady Margaret Infants' 43 44 90 85 210 192 North Road Junior Mixed and Infant 51 58 188 214 366 369 St. Anselm's R.C. 70 75 251 284 360 380 Tudor Road Junior Mixed 38 44 136 151 360 343 Tudor Road Infants' 29 38 65 87 221 228 Secondary Schools: Southall Grammar 51 50 336 318 662 630 Dormers Wells Boys' 39 39 226 221 581 573 Dormers Wells Girls' 48 58 288 327 595 560 Featherstone Road Boys' 39 45 223 266 577 588 Western Road Girls' 42 50 188 216 445 436 Technical 36 35 147 126 404 361 Special School Talbot Road 99 98 202 192 204 195 27 It is interesting and pleasing to report an annual increase in the percentage of children taking school meals:— Summer Term Autumn Term 1958 40.79 43.69 1959 41.63 46.51 1960 44.84 50.67 OLD PEOPLE The needs of 21 special cases of old people living in difficult circumstances were investigated during 1960, and what happened to them is recorded in the following list:— Admitted to hospital 2 Admitted to old people's home — Remaining at home 19 (a) Home Help provided 3 (b) Home Help and District Nurse provided 1 (c) Home Help and Meals provided 1 (d) Adaptation to house obtained, Home Help provided 2 (e) Awaiting housing for old people 1 (f Home occupation arranged 1 (g) Rehoused (h) No help accepted (i) Chiropody and Home Help provided (j) Awaiting admission to Old People's home (k) Referred to Red Cross for night sitter Two persons brought to the notice of the department in 1959 presented further problems in 1960—one was in need of rehousing and the other needed home help and is having this. Two persons reported in 1957 are still managing at home with Home Help and meals on wheels. The difficulties of the old persons recorded on this list were brought to the notice of the Public Health Department staff either by medical practitioners, interested relations, neighbours or friends, or following complaint by one or other of the statutory authorities. The County Council has the duty, under the National Assistance Act, 1948, of providing residential accommodation for aged and infirm persons in need of care and attention which is not otherwise available to them; and it can do this by providing its own Homes or by arrangements with recognised Voluntary Organisations. The County Council's Welfare Department administers the County Homes, and the number of persons admitted to such homes from the Borough in 1960 was 14, one of whom was brought to our attention first in the year 1955. It has been ascertained from the Area Medical Officer that 439 Southall people were given Home Help during the year and of these 379 consisted of chronic sick or aged persons, and of 708 persons who were assisted by the Home Nurses, 409 were of age 65 or over. Many voluntary associations contributed to provide Christmas parcels or special comforts for old people. Meals on Wheels Service: During the year mid.day meals on four days per week were provided for house.bound old people in need of the service. In 1960, 10,937 meals were delivered, an increase of 2,077 over the 1959 figure. Ninety.one old persons were assisted by means of this scheme during 1960. The maximum number of old people receiving the meals on any one day was 73. A second van was provided and started work on 5th March, and as a result the number of people who could get this service was greatly increased over the 1959 figure. Meals were delivered on four days each week. 28 Chiropody Service for Old People This service was continued throughout 1960. Five local chiropodists gave their services at cheap rates for Old Age Pensioners. In 1960, Middlesex County Officers were empowered to proceed with a scheme for the increase in the provision of chiropody as part of the County Health Services. The County Council was able also to offer financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing chiropody. County Clinics were expected to come into operation early in 1961. Holidays for Old People: The holiday scheme whereby old people get a seaside holiday during off season months of May and September, at reduced rates, continued during 1960 and was operated by the various Old People's Clubs in the Borough. In addition, the Southall Old People's Welfare Association sent 24 Old Age Pensioners in two parties of 12 free of charge for one week's holiday by the sea. The second party consisted of disabled or otherwise housebound old people. Other Services: A service for the provision of cheap laundry and a cheap boot and shoe service are available. The North Thames Gas Board offers a free service of inspection of the gas appliances and service pipes in houses of old age pensioners living alone. The reason for this is to reduce the risk of gas poisoning, a frequent cause of home accidents and fatalities in old people. The offer includes free replacement of faulty pipes and the free repair of faulty appliances. To take advantage of this offer, lists of old people living alone are submitted from the Public Health Department and in due course the homes of the persons nominated on the lists are visited by the Gas Board officers. Fresh lists continued to be supplied from time to time. A visiting library service for Old People who were housebound was started early in 1959—operated by the Southall Old People's Welfare Committee, and with distribution assisted by various young people's groups. Southall Association for the Occupation of the Elderly: The Work Centre for the Elderly situated in the Municipal Sports Ground, and maintained by a voluntary association supported in part by Middlesex County Council and Southall Borough Council, continued to operate throughout 1960. Various types of simple work were carried out by the old people in quite a satisfactory way, indeed, as the firms supplying the work were expected to pay the proper rate for work, it was essential that the work should be completed to their satisfaction. The number of workers at the end of the year was 50, and various types of work were carried out, carding buttons, sorting mixed metallic wastes from a large engineering company, trimming and stamping of metal bolts, trimming of rubber, assembly of ball point pens, etc., and the old people could be put on the jobs which were most suited to their capabilities. Any old age pensioner is eligible to apply for work under this Scheme and once taken on is kept on whether his or her output can be considered significant or not. It is realised by the workers that a flat rate of 10/. per week for a ten hour week is certainly much less than the younger healthy pensioner would be able to obtain in the labour market, but they also realise that as they grow older or ill and less able to do very much work this wage will continue the same. The scheme can never become self.supporting, but it is showing great benefits in the social and even physical well.being of the people who are working. There is a very happy atmosphere in the work rooms. Cups of tea are provided during the morning and afternoon sessions. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47: National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951: No case was dealt with under these powers during 1960. 29 HEALTH EDUCATION Throughout the year, continuous health education was carried on. Talks were given to voluntary associations, political groups, social groups. Topical subjects were highlighted by special postings of health education posters combined with an issue of handbills on the same subjects at the same times—these handbills were displayed on counters and notice boards of public offices, clinics, libraries, etc. Special topics in 1960 included Measles (Recognition and Prevention) and Food Hygiene—while in the summer months particularly much publicity was given to the legal requirements of the Clean Air Act—in this connection the services of the North Thames Gas Board and of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Exhibition were called in and both bodies arranged for their display vans to spend some time in the Borough, so that the people could see for themselves the types of appliances and fuels which would be available. Very many people would pay a visit to these mobile showrooms and follow that up immediately by calling at the Public Health Department to get further information on grants and adaptations. 1,147 persons visited the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation mobile showroom during a one week period in August. Permission was given for letters sent from Council Departments to be franked from time to time with a health education slogan saying—" Guard that SNEEZE " " Guard all FOOD " During the year an approach was made from the Indian Community Workers' Association, who desired guidance on health matters. Various meetings have taken place with the Association's Officers and on two occasions addresses on health were given at special film shows for Indians. Codes of hygiene were drafted and translated into various languages of India for the information of the people of India and Pakistan who now live permanently in Southall. The Association's Officers were most eager to learn and to spread information about any health topic—and said that a number of the films already shown at these weekly performances have dealt with problems of hygiene. Because of the risk of spread of tuberculosis amongst people from a country with a climate so different to ours, it was desired that the need for testing for susceptibility to tuberculosis should be made known and as will be seen in the section of this Report on tuberculosis— there was a very good response to this campaign. In the same connection the dangers of overcrowding were stressed, and are continually being stressed by the Public Health Inspectors when they visit houses in multi.occupation. DEATHS FROM ACCIDENTS The number who died as a result of accident other than motor vehicle accident appeared to rise again, being 24 in 1960, as compared with 18 in 1959 and 14 in 1958. Five of the accidental deaths were the result of accident in the home, and six happened in Hospital. Eight elderly persons died from the consequences of falls, four at home, and four in Hospital. Three persons were found drowned; two died from barbiturate poisoning; three died from injuries at work; one following a fall from a window; one from coal gas poisoning; and two from asphyxia due to inhalation of food and vomit. This is a tragic figure, and combined with an increase in the deaths from road accidents, shows a great deterioration—33 persons dead who might, if they themselves or those in charge of them had taken a very little more care, reasonably be expected to be alive now. 30 ROAD SAFETY The number of motor vehicle accidents occurring within the Borough of Southall was a little greater in 1960 than in 1959. The number of fatalities was also greater. Seven persons (5 adults, 2 children) were killed in street accidents. Details are as follows:— Persons Killed Type of Road User Cause o f Accident Age Sex Pedal Cyclist Pedal cyclist travelling south out of T junction was struck by PMC travelling east 14 M Pedestrian Boy ran from south kerb from behind stationary PMC— hit side of passing eastbound lorry 6 M Moped rider Double.decker PSV travelling south overtook stationary vehicle on near side, swerved over to avoid Heavy Goods Vehicle travelling north and struck moped travelling south ahead 63 M Pedestrian Pedestrian crossing from east to west was struck by motor.cyclist travelling south 50 M Private motor car passenger Private motor car travelling south skidded on wet roadway and collided with lamp.post 46 F Pedal Cyclist Pedal cyclist lost control of pedal cycle and fell off 77 M Pedestrian Vehicle travelling east over cross.roads junction swerved to avoid a northbound private motor car alleged to to have crossed against red light. Vehicle then swerved again in unsuccessful attempt to avoid pedestrian and in doing so collided with a west.bound private motor car 68 M Persons Injured Adult School Age Under 5 Serious Slight Serious Slight Serious Slight Pedestrians 10 42 3 15 — 1 Total 52 Total 18 Total 1 Pedal cyclists 11 78 1 10 — 1 Total 89 Total 11 Total 1 P.M.C. drivers 6 Total 42 36 P.M.C. passengers 9 Total 42 33 Total 5 5 Motor cyclists 13 66 Total 79 Scooters and Mopeds 3 29 Total 32 Drivers of other vehicles 1 Total 17 16 Passengers in other vehicles 2 28 — 1 Total 30 Total 1 Road Roller Driver Total 1 1 Adult Total 384 Children Total 37 Fatalities Adult Total 5 Children Total 2 Although there was a sizeable fall from 56 in 1959 to 37 in I960, in the number of children injured on the roads, two deaths of children after a year when no child fatality occurred, outlined the need for constant teaching of road safety—both were school children. The Road Safety Committee of the Borough Council maintained a full programme of education in road safety in which the Metropolitan Police took an active part. The Southall school children received constant training and exhortation on the use of roads. Of the seven dying as a result of motor accidents in Southall five were Southall residents; four other Southall residents died as a result of motor accidents received when they were away from home. 31 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply and Water Services Water is supplied to nearly the whole of the district by the South.West Suburban Water Company. The Metropolitan Water Board supplies a small area in the southern part of the district, and the Rickmansworth & Uxbridge Valley Water Company a small area in the northern part. The supply is satisfactory, both in quality and quantity. Reports on sampling carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board are issued from time to time. All inhabited houses are supplied from public water mains and there are no standpipes in use on mains. Under Section 35, Middlesex County Council Act, 1956, provision is made for immediate action to be taken by the Local Authority to restore a water supply which has been cut off for some default. Fourteen samples of artesian well water (from factories situated in the Borough) were taken, all of which were sterile and pure. Sewerage Middlesex County Council provides the facilities for purification of sewage from the Borough at the Mogden Sewage Works. The amount of congestion occurring in the drains and sewers of the Borough, partly as a result of increase in the number of houses and shops and partly due to the fact that improved knowledge of hygiene results in an increased use of water for cleanliness, meant that problems have arisen of overcharging of sewers, and of flooding during periods of heavy rain. Measures to relieve this have had to be taken, and the latest position with regard to these improvements is as follows:— During November surcharging of the soil sewers in the south of the Borough reached dangerous proportions owing to a partial blockage combined with very heavy rain. The danger was averted by the prompt use of a special pump hired for the purpose. The work was carried out successfully under very bad conditions. During the year preparatory work on the Southern Soil Relief Sewer Scheme was completed and the Council entered into a contract so that construction work could commence in January, 1961. A larger pump for surface water was installed by owners of properties in Livingstone Road and Alma Road in order to reduce flooding of the premises. The Council also decided to consider making provision for the improvement of the surface water sewers serving this area. As part of the scheme for improving Tentelow Lane, a surface water sewer was provided in a part of the road not previously drained. Complaints were received of an unpleasant smell originating from an emergency overflow chamber in the Brent Valley Main Sewer on the east side of the River Brent. This chamber is the property of the County Council and is situated within the Borough of Ealing. The matter was discussed with the County Council and Ealing Borough Council with a view to reducing the nuisance. British Waterways installed a septic tank to deal with sewage from the cottages at Bulls Bridge and only two pail closets remain at these cottages. The premises in Carlyle Avenue formerly using two pail closets were connected to the sewer. The only other pail closets emptied by the Council are two at "Springdale." There are two cesspools emptied by the Council's gully emptier—one at "Springdale" and one at Wyke Green. Sanitary Inspection of the District The total number of inspections of premises made during the year by the Public Health Inspectors was 8,543. Table XII gives an analysis of the number and nature of such inspections. There was a considerable rise in the amount of visits carried out under the Clean Air Act (Smoke Control Areas) requirements. These visits served multiple purposes, 32 33 as any sanitary defects in the houses visited would be brought to the notice of a health inspector calling even though the purpose of his call was specific. The 1960 figure of 2,484 inspections in connection with the Clean Air Act compares with 1,708 in 1959 and 309 in 1958. Another increased figure was that for visits to Food Shops which rose by almost 20%. Market There is a market, part open, part covered, in the High Street where a weekly horse and cattle sale was held on Wednesdays and a general sale of market produce and goods was held on Saturdays. Special attention was paid regularly to the hygienic provisions and maintenance there. In addition, travelling fairs and circuses spend periods in the Borough, three to four times a year, and require supervision. School Sanitation, Ventilation and Lighting Schools were kept under review during the year. Although no actual improvements were made in School Sanitation, or in the School Canteens in 1960, plans were laid down by Middlesex County Council for certain works to commence in 1961. The Borough Council provides the number of dustbins required for the removal of school refuse. Eradication of Bed Bugs Statistics for the year:— (a) Number of Council houses (1) found to be infested 2 (2) disinfested during the year 2 (b) Number of other houses Total 13 (1) found to be infested 11 (2) disinfested during the year 11 Canal Boats Southall is not a registration authority for Canal Boats. The routine inspections carried out by neighbouring authorities having boat docks, reduce this work to a minimum and no report on any particular boat was necessary. Mortuary and Post.Mortem Room The mortuary, situated in Havelock Road, provides adequate accommodation for the Borough. No bodies were deposited in the mortuary during the year. One hundred and fifty nine bodies were deposited in the mortuary at Acton, and fifty.one bodies in the mortuary at Uxbridge, for post.mortem purposes and coroner's inquest if necessary. Factories Act, 1937 The following tables give details of the work done in connection with the factories and outworkers in the Borough:— Inspections Factory Premises Number of Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted (i) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 18 15 . .

Premises where upholstery is reconditioned and secondhand articles sold are included in the list of general inspections. 35 HOUSING Of the 83 houses recommended for slum clearance in the provisional programme for the years 1955 to 1960, the majority are now either demolished or under sentence of demolition as soon as all occupying families have been housed. Properties already dealt with on the list submitted to the Ministry of Health are:— Numbers 1 and 2, Bells Cottages and 1 to 6, Pluckington Place Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, Killamey Cottages Numbers 5 to 18, Featherstone Terrace Numbers 2 to 4 and 18 to 28, Spencer Street Demolished 55 Numbers 6 to 16, Spencer Street Numbers 9 to 15, The Crescent Dagmar Cottage Allowed to remain provided no human habitation 1 One cottage was brought up to suitable standard by the owner and is still inhabited. An offer to modernise five of the houses in the schedule was made and accepted by the Borough Council. In addition, two individual houses, 17 and 19, Grosvenor Road, not on the programme but found to be unsafe, were demolished and the tenants rehoused. Improvement Grants (Housing Act, 1949, as amended by the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958) Forty.eight applications were received and forty.eight were approved for grant for property improvement. The improvements in standards of housing resulting from the use of this type of grant and from the repair conditions by which increased rents can be obtained under the Rent Act, 1957, make a useful although not extensive advance in the attainment of good environmental conditions for healthy living, and the figure continued to rise from 3 in 1958, applied for and approved, to 30 in 1959, applied for with 28 approved, and now the 1960 figure of 48 all approved. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) During the year 17 applications were received, 17 proposals to issue Certificates were approved. Five certificates of revocation of the disrepair certificate were approved, and one rejected. Overcrowding Fewer visits were required in 1960 to be paid for estimation of overcrowding, but thirty.two cases of new overcrowding were confirmed in 1960, seven more than in 1959. Twenty cases of overcrowding were relieved during the year. The number remaining on the Department's register of overcrowding at the end of the year was 60 dwellings, which is an increase of twelve on last year's figure. For further detail see Table XIII, page 62. Rehousing of Applicants for Council Dwellings Council Housing within the Borough The number of families obtaining Council accommodation for the first time in 1960 was 56. Thirteen old age pensioners were moved into old people's dwellings. New Town Housing The total number of families removing to New or Expanded Towns: 25 families nominated under the Industrial Selection Scheme up to April, 1956 (since when the Council has had to pay subsidy for every family moving from this Borough to New or Expanded Towns.) In addition 50 families who had found their own accommodation 36 in one of the New Towns were subsequently accepted as Council nominees. The total number of families who have moved to New or Expanded Towns since that date is a further 215, twenty.nine families having been rehoused in this way during 1960. Modernisation of Council Houses There were 426 houses, built between 1930 and 1936, which still had old ranges with hot water supply, except where the tenants themselves installed modern fireplaces. 67 of these ranges were replaced by the Council during 1960, making a total of 230 modernised up to the 31st December, I960. Houses Let in Lodgings There were known at the end of the year to be 180 houses let in lodgings, owned and occupied mainly by Indians, within a few instances West Africans and Irish as sub.tenants. Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1957, is applied to each of these houses so that owners shall know as soon as possible "what is in the authority's opinion the maximum number of persons by whom it is suitable to be occupied." The Public Health Act, 1936, had on occasion to be used for the repair and cleansing of waterclosets and accumulations of rubbish. Middlesex County Council Act, 1944—Section 345 The caravan site at the junction of Regina Road and Pluckington Place continued to be used as the winter quarters of a member of The Showmen's Guild. One family still occupied a caravan near the Grand Union Canal, at Bull's Bridge. New Housing The following details have been supplied by the Borough Engineer, outlining the complete amount of house building for Southall since the end of the war. Built by Southall Borough Council During the Year 1960 Since the end of the war (including 1960) Within the Borough Outside the Borough Within the Borough Outside the Borough Old People's Dwellings .. - 12 83 12 Houses 6 Bungalows - 330 136 Flats - 12 390 144 Prefabricated Houses - - 299 - In 1960, six of the temporary prefabricated bungalows were demolished and the tenants transferred to permanent housing. 21 of these bungalows have now been demolished leaving 278 still standing. Built by Private Enterprise During the Year 1960 Since the end of the War (including 1960) Within the Borough Outside the Borough Within the Borough Outside the Borough Old People's Bungalows Houses - — 20 — 18 Houses - 287 - 3 Bungalows Flats 2 — 100 . Prefabricated Houses - — - - 37 38 HYGIENE OF FOOD Food Poisoning Three notifications of food poisoning were received during 1960. Two of these were not confirmed bacteriologically, and one was confirmed as an infection with the organism Salmonella Typhi.Murium. This compares with ten confirmed cases of food poisoning in 1959. Personal Hygiene The free washing facilities in the public conveniences, which were brought into operation in September, 1950, continued to be available throughout 1960. During that period 11,300 paper towels were issued free, and also 3,271 linen towels, which were provided at a cost of 2d. per person. These figures suggest a substantial rise in the use of the washing facilities available in the Council's public conveniences. Milk The following licences under the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations' 1949 and 1950, and Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 and 1950 were issued:— for the sale of Tuberculin Tested Milk 24 for the sale of Pasteurised Milk 26 for the sale of Sterilised Milk 26 Supplementary Licences 16 Automatic Machines 6 98 Ice Cream The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment, etc.) Regulations, 1947.1952. As there were no manufacturers in the Borough, temperature control observations, as laid down in these Regulations, were not required. Routine work was carried out under Article 4 of the 1947 Regulations to check the conservation of ice.cream in cinemas. Food Sampling The bacteriological analyses of 199 food samples, taken during the year, were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service. 139 of these specimens were ice.cream samples, covering 12 makes of ice.cream, and following bacteriological analyses the ice.creams were graded as follows:— Excellent 89 Satisfactory 33 Doubtful 6 Unsatisfactory 11 Thirty.three samples were taken of Imitation Cream. The results of these were all satisfactory. Satisfactory communication has been maintained during the year with the County Public Control Department, and the report on the work carried out in Southall by the staff of that Department is as follows:— Article Total Samples Procured Unsatisfactory Milk (various) 75 1 Butter and Margarine 13 — Cakes 4 — Cream 9 — Drugs 4 — Fish and Fish Products 10 — Fruit, Fresh and Canned 5 — Ice Cream 11 — Meat, Meat Products and Liver 42 — Sweets 5 — Vinegar and Non.Brewed Condiment 12 — Miscellaneous 15 — 205 1 Milk. A bottle of milk purchased by a resident of the Borough contained a foreign body which proved to be a piece of rolled cardboard. An official caution was issued. The Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887.1953. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of these Acts is to ensure compliance with the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act, of 1926. These orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, dried fruit, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. The inspections were made in 105 premises of 242 displays of these foodstuffs, and no infringements were detected. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953. This Order requires pre.packed food to be marked with the name and address or with the registered trade mark of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 270 articles of pre.packed food was examined at 92 different premises. Compliance with the Order was satisfactory. 39 Other samples taken:— Result Sausages No harmful ingredient Ice Lollies (21) Satisfactory Strawberries Satisfactory Faggots Satisfactory Swab of ice cream server Unsatisfactory Rinse water of ice cream server (2) One sample satisfactory. One sample unsatisfactory False and Misleading Descriptions. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. Corrective action taken under this heading within the whole area of the County has equal effect within the Boroughs and the work is combined with inspections made to ensure the proper operation of the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. Examples of cases where corrective action was taken are:— Television and press advertisements which suggested that a certain cheese was a cream cheese where, in fact, it contained insufficient milk fat to be properly described as cream cheese. Oranges, tangerines and grapefruit described as seedless, but found to contain seeds. Jam cream sponge and cream doughnuts containing imitation cream. Special Designated Milks. One Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) Licence was issued during the year for premises in the Borough and 58 samples of designated milk were taken. All obtained a satisfactory certificate. Safe Milk. In addition to the foregoing, 12 samples of raw milk were procured within this Borough and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli. None was found contaminated. This was a good year for food sampling, no faults of quality having been found in any of the samples taken by the County Inspectors. Meat Inspections No slaughtering of meat is carried on in Southall. Food Premises—Inspection There was an increase in the amount of visiting to food premises during 1960. More new shop premises with first class modern design and applying modern hygienic standards to methods of food handling have been opened in the Borough and this helps to improve the standard of existing food premises because of the competition for trade which ensues. The number of food premises in the Borough by type of business is shown as follows:— Shops 340 Greengrocers 50 Grocers 118 Confectioners 97 Fish Friers 11 Bakers 17 Butchers 35 Fishmongers 12 Catering Establishments (including Canteens) 128 Food Factories 20 488 Premises required to be registered are as follows:— Food & Drugs Act, 1955, Section 16 Fish Curing 6 Manufacture of Sausages or Preserved Food 32 Manufacture of Ice.Cream — Sale only of Ice.Cream 148 Manufacture and Sale of Iced.Lollies — Middlesex County Council Act, 1950, Section 11 Premises of Street Traders 9 Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 Dealer/Processors 1 40 The following table shows the quantity of food examined and the disposal of condemned food.

No prosecutions were taken under Section 2 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. 41 Unsound Food The following table shows items of unsound food which were investigated during the year, and the action taken. Vendor Subject of Enquiry Source of Supply Action Local Shop Mould in Angel Cake Baked outside Southall £5 fine, £3.3.0 costs Local Shop Maggots in Currants Manufactured in Southall Warning letter No harmful ingredients, no action Local industrial canteen Sausages unpalatable 42 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The amount of smoke, grit and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere over the Borough of Southall continued to be recorded during the year 1960 at the five sites at which recordings have been carried out for previous years. In addition, equipment for the setting up of a station at the Manor House, for the estimation of Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide pollution by the Volumetric Method, whereby air is drawn through two filters, one dry and one liquid, continuously and the amount of atmospheric pollution calculated every 24 hours from the matter deposited on the filter, and from the amount of sulphur taken up by the liquid. This machine came into operation in January, 1959, and it is now possible to give figures for two years working. See page 44. The results obtained from the five sites, i.e. Recreation Ground and Railway Allotments—lead peroxide method, Hortus Cemetery, New Primary School, Railway Allotments—deposit gauges, are tabulated on page 45 and graphs prepared from the figures on the tables are to be found on pages 46, 47 and 48. Comparison of nine years' averages at Hortus Cemetery.

Observations of individual factory chimneys seeming to be emitting smoke or grit to excess were continued throughout the year. There was a marked improvement in the amount of smoke emission recorded during these observations. Details of the observations made because of particular subjects of complaint and the results of these observations can be seen in the following table. 1959 1960 Number of sites of routine observation 5 (3 deposit gauges and 5 (3 deposit gauges and 2 lead peroxide gauges) 2 lead peroxide gauges) Number of complaints of nuisance from smoke, 16 complaints re 12 8 complaints re 8 smell or grit and number of premises concerned premises premises Number of places kept under observation 19 10 Number of observations made 76 27 Number of times black smoke was detected 2 1 Total time of black smoke emissions 2½ minutes l½ minutes Number of times dark smoke observed 16 4 Total time of dark smoke emissions 62¾ minutes 16 minutes Minimum time of observations 10 minutes 15 minutes Maximum time of observations 110 minutes 60 minutes Total time of observations 2,073 minutes 927 minutes On 1 occasion black smoke (Ringelmann 4) was detected from one industrial premises. On 4 occasions dark smoke (Ringelmann 2.4) was detected from another industrial premises. Smoke Control Areas Observations during the year on Smoke Control Area No. 1 recorded 4 instances where smoke was emitted and found to be due to ignition by wood and paper, although gas ignition was available. The householders were warned. 43 Smoke Control Order No. 2 was confirmed during the year, to come into operation on 1st May, 1961. The first estimate for conversions was received on the 14th June, 1960. Inspections were substantially completed in Smoke Control Area No. 3, which consists of 1,073 dwellings, 84 commercial premises, 14 industrial premises and 10 other premises, in an area of 91 acres. Acid Smuts from oil.burning chimneys The emission of acid smuts from a laundry furnace was abated by the erection of a new chimney, specially designed for the purpose. Emissions were still recorded from another industrial installation used only in autumn and winter months for space heating. In spite of the fullest co.operation from the firm concerned in experiments with additives and varying fluid viscosities, this problem remained unsolved. Volumetric Method The daily mean concentration of Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide is measured by volumetric apparatus in the Public Health Inspector's Office. The gauge faces west and a main road in a built up area of residential and commercial premises. The term "smoke" is used to denote all fine suspended impurity collected by the test filter and expressed as milligrams per 100 cubic metres. The term "Sulphur Dioxide " includes all acid producing gases in the air with the exception of carbon dioxide and is the net acidity of the air calculated as sulphur dioxide and expressed as parts per 100 million parts of air. The comparative figures for 1959 and 1960 are:— SMOKE (mgms.per 100 cubic metres) SULPHUR DIOXIDE (parts per 100 million) Monthly Average Highest Daily Average Monthly Average Highest daily Average 1959 1960 1959 1960 1959 1960 1959 1960 January 41 21 137 74 20 9 66 33 February 31 20 94 61 14 8 40 19 March 17 16 42 34 7 9 22 21 April 11 8 38 39 5 4 20 18 May 9 7 19 15 5 5 14 15 June 5 3 15 8 3 3 9 13 July 3 2 8 6 2 1 7 3 August 5 4 12 8 3 2 12 4 September 8 7 17 14 5 4 14 9 October 10 11 19 22 7 5 16 11 November 25 15 97 57 10 5 34 16 December 14 24 54 53 5 10 17 25 44 .fc.

Three were remedied. One was not confirmed. Byelaws of Good Rule and Government give control of noisy animals. In 1960 a new Act for the control of noise became law—this was " The Noise Abatement Act, 1960." The difficulty in the way of proving an offence under this Act is chiefly that no standard is very clearly laid down as to how loud or how persistent a noise must be to be dangerous to health. Rodent Control The following table gives details of work carried out in accordance with the policy of the Council, as outlined in previous reports. Total notifications of Rats and Mice Confirmed Non-Confirmed 184 180 4 Business and Industrial 31 premises treated Domestic 153 „ „ Rats found and cleared in 116 „ Mice „ „ „ „ 64 Total number of visits in 1960—1,283 Sewers Ls7 Treatment Total number of manholes baited 116 Number of poison takes 35 No takes 81 There was no improvement in the figures for rat infestation during 1959, and in 1960 a great increase in Departmental Officers' time was required to deal with this problem. Visits paid increased from 889 in 1959 to 1,283 in 1960. In some instances, information about infestation suspected was not reported to the Department until long after the first observation, and as a result generations of breeding had increased the rat population, making treatment a long and expensive task. Gross carelessness in the storage of foodstuffs in factories and in homes, and the heedless disposal of waste food and waste food containers is destroying the good results of the work of years. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Six establishments were licensed during the year. The number of animals kept in each case is small and conditions have remained satisfactory. Administration of the Shops Acts Routine visiting of shops in connection with the Shops Acts Regulations continued. River Pollution Inspection of the rivers and canal of Southall during the year did not give evidence of any individual site of pollution in Southall on which action could be taken. Gross pollution occurred in the River Brent in June as the result of a sewer fracture in the next Borough of Ealing. Warning notices were prepared by the Borough Engineer that the River was unfit and dangerous to bathers and posted at appropriate places. These notices were left in position, and frequent sampling of river water carried out, until the water could be reported as reasonably safe, which was necessarily some time after the sewer had been repaired. Middlesex County Council officers in 1959 carried out certain improvements to the 49 River Crane in Southall to relieve flooding in the Delamere Road area. In spite of the improvements carried out, some flooding took place in Delamere Road during 1960 due to the exceptionally wet weather, and investigation of this problem was continued. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment Five establishments were inspected for licence under this heading and all were found satisfactory for the purpose which was intended. Details are as follows:— Purpose No. of Licences Chiropody only 2 Massage, Chiropody and Electrical Treatment 3 Medical Examination of Borough Council Employees During 1960 a total of 76 medical examinations were carried out on applicants for Borough Council employment or members of the Borough Council staff. These examinations were carried out with regard to suitability for employment on the Council's permanent staff, for entry into the Sickness Pay Scheme, or for review after prolonged periods of sick leave. A survey of sickness absence amongst Borough Council staff during the year is shown in the table below, and shows a great improvement on the amount of sick leave absence both amongst indoor and outdoor staff. Members of Indoor Establishment Year Staff Total Requiring Sick Leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1960 154 74 888 48 1959 157 93 1,295 59 Members of Outdoor Establishment Year Staff Total (Part-time and Full-time) Requiring sick leave Total days sick leave Percentage requiring sick leave 1960 278 153 4,077½ 55 1959 282 206 5,509½ 73 Nuclear Radiation The increasing production, transport, and use of radioactive material means that a new Public Health problem can arise. It has become apparent that some method of control is necessary and that a local authority requires to be informed of all possible sources of radiation within its district. Radioactive isotopes are used in industry, in hospitals and in technical schools and colleges, and it is important that as much information as possible should be available as to the precautions taken in the use of the substances, and what, if anything, has to be done about waste products. At present the total use in Southall is extremely minute. The Metropolitan Water Board now gives, with its monthly report on the state of the water coming into public supply, a short notice of the radio activity as estimated by the Board's Laboratory Staff, and also records the reports of the Atomic Energy Authority on the radioactive content of outfalls into the Thames from the Nuclear reactors. The Radio Active Substances Act (1960) provided for the central registration and control of the keeping and use of radio active materials and the disposal of radio active waste, and enabled the central authority to notify local authorities of the existence of registered premises within their boundaries. An operative date was not fixed in 1960. 50 HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER AUTHORITIES North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board Through the Uxbridge Group Management Committee this authority maintains two hospitals in Southall, the Southall-Norwood Hospital (28 beds) for treatment of general medical and surgical cases and casualties, and Mount Pleasant Hospital (59 beds) for the treatment of geriatric cases. St. Bernard's Hospital is managed by its own Committee and is for the reception of cases of mental and nervous disorders; it has 2,507 beds and takes patients from an extensive area comprising parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Middlesex, including the Borough of Southall. Informal, temporary and compulsorily certified patients of all types are admitted, and all modern forms of treatment are carried out. Patients are now admitted informally (under the Mental Health Act, 1959) and Informal and Compulsory became the sole categories of admissions after 1st November, 1960. Other hospitals outside the Borough which are used to a considerable extent by patients from Southall are Hillingdon Hospital, West Middlesex Hospital and King Edward Hospital, Ealing, and Southall cases for geriatric treatment may be admitted to St. John's Hospital, Uxbridge. The greatest number attend Hillingdon, which has all the facilities of an Acute General Hospital, a Geriatric Section and a Maternity Wing, either as outpatients, or as inpatients; in 1960, 1,452 Southall residents had inpatient treatment in Hillingdon compared with 2,077 in 1959. A splendid new Maternity Wing was completed and brought into use at Hillingdon Hospital in 1960, and 807 of the mothers and babies discharged from Hillingdon Maternity Department were Southall people. The Uxbridge Chest Clinic is the regional centre to which residents of the Borough of Southall may be referred regarding chest disorders. It is also the regional centre for the diagnosis, treatment, aftercare and prevention of tuberculosis (both pulmonary and non-pulmonary). Persons may be referred there by their own doctors, from Clinics, etc. Special "X-ray only" Clinics are available without appointment, otherwise persons are seen by appointment. There are male and female beds under the surveillance of clinic physicians at:— (1) Harefield Hospital for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis; and at (2) Hillingdon Hospital for the treatment of other chest disorders. County Council of Middlesex—Health Department The County Council of Middlesex is the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946, and provides the following services in the Borough.
