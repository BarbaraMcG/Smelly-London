Reference No. jsw/al/g.60/267. 1st August, 1962. Dear Sir, I have pleasure in enclosing one copy of my Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for the year 1961. Yours faithfully, Medical Officer of Health. The Chief Medical Officer, Ministry of Health, Savile Row, W.1. Enclosure. THE ROYAL BOROUGH OF KENSINGTON Telephone: WEStern 3173 Public Health Department, Hornton Street, Kensington, W.8. 1st June, 1962 % To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Royal Borough of Kensington. My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in presenting the Annual Report on the state of the public health in Kensington for 1961. The Minister of Health has again requested (Circular l/62) that the Report should be generally in the same form as has been the case for some years past. The public health in Kensington during the year under review was maintained at a satisfactory standard. Population. The population of the borough as ascertained at the Census in 1961 was 170,891, but for the purpose of this report, the population for 1961 has been estimated by the Registrar-General to be 169,080. The estimated population figure for the previous year was 167,240. Birth Rate. The number of live births per 1,000 population of the borough was 19.5 in 1961 which compares with the figure of 18.4 for the previous year. Death Rate. The number of deaths per 1,000 population in 1961 was 10.24, slightly higher than the death rate for the previous year (9.91). Area Comparability Factors for Birth and Death Rates. Comparisons of crude birth and death rates between local areas are not strictly valid since these rates take no account of the varying composition of the populations of the different areas by sex and age. In order to compare Kensington birth and death rates with England and Wales as a whole, the Registrar-General has, in the case of death rates since 1934, and, in the case of birth rates since 1949, supplied area comparability factors (A.C.Fs.). This is considered to be necessary as the proportion of old people to young, and of males to females, varies considerably in different districts. The local crude death rates are affected as the mortality at the extremes of life is much greater than in the middle period, and, at practically all ages, the mortality in females is rather less than in males of corresponding ages. Similarly, so far as the local birth rates are concerned, the child bearing component of the population varies in different districts. In a borough such as Kensington, which has a higher proportion of females amongst its inhabitants compared with most other districts, the crude birth and death rates cannot be compared satisfactorily with those of, say, an industrial district, where the proportion of males is much higher. The Registrar-General has supplied, for use in Kensington in 1961, the figures 0.72 for births said 1.00 for deaths. The crude birth and death rates for the borough should be multiplied by the appropriate factor, and when so adjusted the results are comparable with the crude rates for England and Wales or with the corresponding adjusted rates for any other area. - 2 - The following table gives the adjusted Kensington birth and death rates compared with the provisional rates for London and for England and Wales for the year 1961 - Kensington adjusted London England and Wales No. of births per 1,000 population 14.04 18.7 17.4 No. of deaths per 1,000 population 10.24 11.9 12.0 Infant Death Rate. This rate for 1961 was 20.9, a very slight increase compared with the rate for the previous year of 20.8. The provisional rate for the County of London was 21.5 and for England and Wales was 21.4. The following table shows the rates for the last five years- Year Kensington London England and Wales 1961 20.9 21.5 21.4 1960 20.8 21.6 21.7 1959 24.8 22.3 22.0 1958 22.7 22.6 22.5 1957 28.2 22.0 23.1 It will be seen that the infant death rate for Kensington was practically the same as last year's rate* Variations in the infant mortality rate are contributed partly to by perinatal mortality, i.e. stillbirths and deaths in the first week of life, prematurity (see table below) and the statistical difficulties arising from the small numbers involved. Just over two deaths suffice to increase the rate by one.

Two deaths of mothers due to child-birth were recorded in 1961, giving a maternal death rate per 1,000 live and still births of 0.60. (The provisional maternal mortality rate for the County of London was 0.63 and for England and Wales the figure was 0.33} The causes of death given in respect of these two maternal deaths were - (a) Haemorrhage from ruptured ectopic gestation (b) Obstructed labour (inco-ordinate uterine action)(Caesarean section). Infectious Diseases. There was no serious outbreak of infectious disease in the borough during 1961. The total number of notifications received was 2,150 in comparison with 1,138 in the previous year. The difference is almost entirely due to the increase in the number of cases of measles notified in 1961 compared with last year. One case of diphtheria was notified in 1961. This was the first case notified since 1956. Tuberculosis. The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 100,000 population was 10.05 which was higher than last year by I.65. The 1961 Kensington death rate compares with the rate (provisional) of 7*2 for England and Wales. Lung Disease. Kensington's death rate from pulmonary tuberculosis per 100,000 population increased in 1961 compared with the previous year, but the death rate for cancer of the lung showed a marked decrease. Comparative figures for England and Wales showed a decrease in the rate in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis, but a continuing increase in the death rate for lung cancer. The following table shows the trend in these diseases since the end of the wars- Year England and Wales Kensington Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Pulmonary Tuberculosis Cancer of the Lung Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate Deaths Rate 1948 18,798 44.0 10,162 23.8 76 45.0 45 26.6 1949 17,471 40.5 10,975 25.5 56 32.0 50 28.7 1950 14,079 32.1 12,241 28.0 52 29.0 70 39.4 1951 12,031 27.5 13,247 30.2 36 17.5 70 40.9 1952 9,335 21.2 14,218 32.3 29 16.8 71 41.1 1953 7,913 17.9 15,132 34.3 26 15.1 65 37.9 1954 7,069 16.0 16,331 36.9 20 11.7 72 42.2 1955 5,838 13.1 17,271 38.9 12 7.1 73 43.1 1956 4,851 10.9 18,185 40.7 19 11.2 73 43.2 1957 4,250 9.5 19,118 42.6 13 7.7 90 53.6 1958 4,000 8.9 19,809 43.9 10 6.0 79 47.7 1959 3,475 7.7 21,063 46.4 9 5.4 75 45.0 1960 3,094 6.8 21,992 48.1 11 6.6 94 56.0 1961 3,001 6.5 22,809 49.4 16 9.45 71 42.0 (Death rates quoted above are per 100,000 population) -4- Housing The slum clearance programme adopted by the Council, in collaboration with the London County Council, passed, in 1961, through a period of consolidating action, although an additional clearance area, consisting of Nos.375 to 401 (odd) Portobello Road and Nos.5 to 11 (odd) Telford Road, was declared during the year. In this case the Council decided to make a Compulsory Purchase Order with a view to redeveloping the site (together with Lionel Mews) by the erection of 42 flats. Attention was concentrated on completing the redevelopment of the first phase of acres of the Kensal New Town area. During the year the two tower blocks (Hazlewood Tower and Adair Tower) consisting of 156 flats were completed, and the 40 flats and maisonettes (which complete stage 1 of phase l) are due to be completed in 1962. The outstanding clearance areas, Kensal New Town (NoA), (No.5) and (No.6) areas, which were declared by the Council in 1960, were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government subject to slight modifications. Plans for the redevelopment of these areas bounded by Golborne Gardens, Golborne Road, Southam Street and Adair Road, were prepared. The redevelopment will comprise four blocks, as follows:- Block A: Three storeys with main elevation facing Adair Road one 3-roomed flat and fourteen 4-roomed flats, with eleven basement garages and fifteen basement stores for tenants. Block B: Four storeys with main elevation facing Adair Road. The block is connected to Southam House, and has twelve 2-roomed flats, with four basement garages and twelve basement stores for tenants. Block C: Three storeys facing Golborne Road. Seven shops and three surgery units for doctors on the ground floor; ten 4-roomed maisonettes on the first and second floors; five basement garages and ten basement stores for tenants, and a store under each of the shops. Block D: Four storeys facing Southam Street. Twenty-six 2-roomed flats, with six basement garages and eighteen basement stores for tenants. The accommodation provided in this scheme will be 63 flats and maisonettes, 7 shops with stores, units for three medical practices, 55 stores for tenants, and 26 garages. The remainder of the Kensal New Town area, the clearance of which will be undertaken jointly by the London County Council and the Borough Council, now becomes the next major operation in connection with slum clearance in Kensington. The Borough Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present acres, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the Borough Council's present 6½ acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for redeveloping - 5 - a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington of 3.6 acres which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of the canal. This remainder is fast "ripening off" and it has already become necessary for the Council to deal with a few individual unfit houses where, owing to danger to health, it was necessary to secure prior demolition before the main clearance area operations are commenced. Legislation for dealing with badly-managed tenement houses was greatly improved when the Housing Act, 1961 was passed by Parliament and came into operation on 24th November, 1961. Parts II and III of this Act, together with the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962 will provide the Council with strong powers to deal with those substantially built houses in Kensington which have become a problem owing to overcrowding and congestion, lack of adequate sanitary accommodation and absence of proper management. The Public Health Committee are at the present time actively considering the operation of these new powers, and it is hoped that good use will be made of them in the near future. Clean Air Act. The work of fulfilling the programme laid down by the Council to make the borough "smokeless" was proceeded with energetically during the year. The Holland Ward (No.2) Smoke Control Area (against which objections were made by five ratepayers) was confirmed by the Minister after a public enquiry, and came into operation on 1st October, 1961. The Pembridge Ward (No. 1) Smoke Control Area, comprising approximately 110 acres and containing 2,517 dwellings and 342 other premises, also came into operation on 1st October, 1961. The Pembridge Ward (No.2) Smoke Control Order was made by the Council on 27th June, 1961, and will come into operation on 1st October, 1962. It contains 2,629 dwellings and 303 other premises, and covers 83 acres. The Norland Ward (No.l) Area will be made the subject of an Order in the near future. Thus, the Council's programme is being dealt with in accordance with the scheduled times. Apart from the five isolated objections received in respect of the Holland Ward (No.2) area, which resulted in a twelve months' delay, the residents of Kensington, both owners and occupiers, appear to be welcoming the Council's efforts to reduce atmospheric pollution. The work is of a detailed nature and necessitates numerous inspections to ensure that contraventions of the Clean Air Act will not occur but, generally speaking, the initial difficulties in operating this legislation have been overcome and there is no reason why the work should not proceed quickly and smoothly to its finality. Food Hygiene. The work of enforcing the requirements of the Food Hygiene Regulations was continued throughout the year. Food traders and the public are generally striving to maintain a high hygienic standard in connection with the storage, preparation and sale of food. The willingness of most people to co-operate in the task of ensuring clean food becomes more evident as time goes on. Unfortunately, the need for periodical inspections is still an urgent one, as is indicated by the number of informal notices served (115 in 1961) by the public health inspectors for various contraventions of the Hygiene Regulations and the greater need to take Court proceedings against wilful offenders. Public Health Inspectors. The Council have been seriously concerned with the difficulty of maintaining a staff of Public Health Inspectors adequate to carry out all the functions laid upon them by - 6 - Statutes, Bye-laws, Regulations and Orders. The difficulty is primarily duet to the shortage of qualified staff generally, but, in addition, there are complications which arise because of differences in salary gradings between Provincial and London Inspectors. Salary scales for Public Health Inspectors have been agreed by the National Joint Council and, for the metropolitan boroughs, by the London District Council. For the metropolitan boroughs the London District Council has ruled that "no post shall be so graded as to produce a salary higher than that applicable to A.P.T.III without prior approval being given thereto by the London District Council." Whilst the metropolitan boroughs are restricted by this decision, authorities outside the London area are, in the case of inspectors with special responsibilities, free to determine the grading for the post. This position has given rise to a situation where authorities on the fringe and outside the metropolitan area are paying salaries that are the same or higher than those for comparable posts in London which are subject to the control of the District Council. A position has been created where there is a movement of inspectors from the metropolitan area to these posts in the outer London boroughs. The Council decided to make strong representations to the London District Council on this subject. The situation is further complicated by the lack of suitable training facilities. There are now only two technical colleges, one in North and one in South London which organise courses to assist with the training of inspectors. Both colleges run day courses only, and there are no evening facilities available for students in London. The Council decided to make representations to the Minister of Health on the lack of training facilities, particularly in the central London area, for Public Health Inspectors; requesting support to overcome this training problem, and asking the Minister to receive a deputation from the Council to discuss the subject. The Minister was unable to receive a deputation, but suggested that it was the responsibility of the Public Health Inspectors' Education Board to keep under review the effect on recruitment of training arrangements which they have instituted. The Council, therefore, decided to approach the Education Board. Fortunately, the Council have a number of officers who are training to become Public Health Inspectors. In order to provide that vacancies should be available if, and when, these officers qualify, the Council decided to increase the establishment of Public Health Inspectors from 14 to 18. It was subsequently decided, in view of the acceleration of the programme of making Smoke Control Areas under the Clean Air Act, to increase the establishment by a further qualified Inspector. Re-organisation of London Government The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London issued their report on 19th October, 1960, and the Commission's recommendations were virtually identical with the proposals submitted by the Council in their written and oral evidence. The Borough Council's proposals were:- (i) That the system of two-tier local government in London be retained. (ii) That one first-tier authority be constituted for the whole of the Greater London area. (iii) That such first-tier authority's functions be confined to those services which are of a regional or co-ordinating character or which provide special services for a limited number of persons in any one borough. - 7 - (iv) That second-tier authorities be created where necessary by amalgamation of existing authorities with wherever possible a population of 150,000/250,000 and an area of 3,000/4,000 acreso (v) That the power and duty of providing all local and personal services be conferred on such authorities. The Government issued a White Paper on the proposals for the reorganisation of London Government in which they mention that the report of the Royal Commission has been carefully studied with the views of over 100 local authorities and others who commented on it. The Government's main conclusion is that the Commission were justified in their criticism of the present structure of local government in Greater London, and that their broad design should be adopted as a basis for improving it. In particular, the Government endorse the view that the boroughs ought to become the primary unit of local government; and that a new, directly elected, authority should be set up to administer functions which require to be dealt with over the whole of Greater London. This conclusion is subject to two important qualifications of the Commission's plan. One is that the boroughs ought to be larger, and therefore fewer, than the Commission proposed, and the second was that the education service should be re-organised. The Council welcomed the Government's endorsement of the Royal Commission's view that within the Greater London area the boroughs ought to be the primary units of local government, and were unanimously of the opinion that the proposed amalgamation of Kensington with Chelsea to form a new borough should be accepted. VITAL STATISTICS The table set out on pages 8 and 9 gives the important vital statistics for 1961, together with comparative figures for the previous seven years. -8-,-9- SUMMARY OP VITAL STATISTICS FOR KENSINGTON Description 1961 1960 1959 1958 1957 1956 1955 1954 POPULATION Population (estimated) 169,080 167,240 166,500 165,700 167,900 168,800 169,400 170,600 Density of population per acre 74 73 73 72 73 74 74 74 LIVE BIRTHS Total births 3,295 3,077 3,026 2,990 2,765 2,792 2,674 2,707 Legitimate births 2,697 2,560 2,546 2,549 2,404 2,422 2,361 2,399 Illegitimate births 598 517 480 441 361 370 313 308 Birth rate per 1,000 population 19.5 18.4 18.1 18.0 16.5 16 = 5 15.8 15.9 STILL BIRTHS Total still births 55 44 55 49 50 51 40 48 Legitimate still births 40 31 44 37 42 43 31 40 Illegitimate still births 15 13 11 12 8 8 9 8 Still birth rate per 1,000 total births 16.4 14.1 17.8 16.1 17.8 17.9 14.7 17.4 DEATHS Total deaths 1,731 1,657 1,654 1,659 1,750 1,772 1,744 1,643 Death rate per 1,000 population 10.24 9.91 9.93 10.01 10.4 10.5 10.3 9.63 DEATHS OF INFANTS UNDER 12 MONTHS OF AGE 69 64 75 68 78 59 84 61 Total infant deaths 56 51 63 58 58 50 66 54 Legitimate deaths 13 13 12 10 20 9 18 7 Illegitimate deaths Infant death rate per 1,000 births 20.9 20.8 24.8 22.7 28.2 21.1 31.4 22.5 Death rate of legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate births 20.8 19.9 24.7 22.8 24.1 20.6 27.9 22.5 Death rate of illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate births 21.7 25.1 25.0 22.7 55.4 24.3 57.5 22.7 MATERNAL DEATHS Deaths of mothers as a result of pregnancy or childbirth 2 4 1 1 1 5 1 2 Death rate of mothers per 1,000 live and still births 0.60 1.28 0.32 0.33 0.36 1.76 O.37 0.72 TUBERCULOSIS Death rate from all forms per 100,000 population 10.05 8.4 6.0 6.6 10.1 11.8 10.0 14.0 Death rate from respiratory tuberculosis per 100,000 population 9.45 6.6 5.4 6.0 7.7 11.2 7.1 11.7 Death rate from non-respiratory tuberculosis per 100,000 population 0.6 1.8 0.6 0.6 2.4 0.6 2.9 2.3 KENSINGTON INFANTILE DEATH RATES (Deaths of children under 1 year per 1000 births) - 11 - CAUSES OF DEATH AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF LIFE IN 1961 Cause of Death All Ages Under 1 yr 1 yr and under 5 5 yrs and under 45 45 yrs and under 65 65 yrs and over Respiratory tuberculosis 16 - - 2 9 5 Other forms of tuberculosis 1 - - - - 1 Syphilis 2 - - - 1 1 Diphtheria - — - - - — Whooping Cough - - - - - - Meningococcal infections 1 - 1 - - - Acute poliomyelitis - - - - - - Measles 1 - 1 - - - Other infective diseases, etc. 3 1 - - 1 1 Cancer (all forms) 345 - 1 14 130 200 Leukaemia, aleukaemia 12 - 1 3 2 6 Diabetes 7 - - - 3 4 Vascular lesions of nervous system 194 - - - 29 165 Coronary disease, angina 275 - - 9 71 195 Hypertension with heart disease 26 - - - l 25 Other heart disease 185 - - 6 11 168 Other diseases of circulatory system 112 - - 1 16 95 Influenza 11 - - 1 2 8 Pneumonia 111 9 - 1 10 91 Bronchitis 92 4 1 - 18 69 Other respiratory diseases 18 1 - 1 4 12 Ulcers of the stomach 19 - - - 6 13 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 11 2 - 2 3 4 Nephritis and nephrosis 8 - - 2 4 2 Hyperplasia of prostate 9 - - - 1 8 Pregnancy, childbirth and abortion 2 - - 2 - _ Congenital malformations 16 13 - 2 1 - All other diseases 144 38 4 13 24 65 Motor vehicle accidents 20 - 1 9 2 8 All other accidents 54 1 5 11 13 24 Suicide 36 - - 15 15 6 Homicide and operations of war - - - - - - TOTALS - 1,731 69 15 94 377 1,176 - 12 - GENERAL PROVISION OP HEALTH SERVICES IN THE AREA BACTERIOLOGICAL AND ANALYTICAL WORK The following is a summary of the work performed during 1961:- Nature of specimen or sample Number examined Nose and throat swabs 155 Faeces and rectal swabs 829 Milk (bacteriological) 51 Water (drinking) 8 Water (swimming baths) 12 Ice Cream 21 Miscellaneous 32 WATER SUPPLY The water supply in Kensington is almost entirely provided by the Metropolitan Water Board, but there are two premises which obtain water from artesian and deep wells. Samples of water were taken both by the Council and the owners for bacteriological and chemical examination. Results showed that the waters were suitable for drinking and other domestic purposes. MEDICINAL BATHS (Personal Cleansing Station) The record of work done during 1961 is as follows:- The record of work done during 1961 is as follows:- Description Scabies Vermin Impetigo Other Conditions Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Persons Cleansings Adults Kensington 93 163 86 92 - - - - Other boroughs 10 16 25 25 - - - - Schoolchildren Kensington 89 328 173 173 - - 8 16 Other boroughs 21 100 194 194 1 1 - - Children under 5 Kensington 27 51 33 33 - - — - Other boroughs 2 4 2 2 - - - - Compulsory Cleansings - - 72 72 - - - - TOTALS 242 662 585 591 1 1 8 16 In addition to the cleansing of persons referred to above, articles of personal clothing disinfested at the Medicinal Baths during the year numbered 645. - 13 - DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION A summary of the routine work carried out in 1961 by the disinfecting staff is shown in the following table:- Houses disinfected after infectious disease 185 (291 rooms) Houses disinfested after vermin Loads of furniture treated with hydrogen cyanide 584 (1544 " ) 7 Total weight of furniture, bedding, etc. dealt with:- Tons cwt. qtr. lb. 16 16 2 17 It is the practice of certain foreign countries to prohibit the import of parcels of clothing, unless accompanied with a certificate that the articles have been disinfected. The Council afford facilities to persons desirous of sending clothing abroad, but make a charge of 2/6d. for each certificate provided. During the year, 139 parcels of clothing were disinfected and the income amounted to £17• 7s. 6d. The following table indicates the destination of these parcels No. of parcels Czechoslovakia 69 Spain 55 Rumania 11 Bulgaria 3 Uruguay 1 TOTAL 139 Some other countries allow the import of clothing if accompanied by a certificate stating that no case of infectious disease has occurred at the sender's address within twenty-one days prior to mailing. During the year 29 such certificates were issued. H.C.N. (hydrogen cyanide) Disinfestation With the manufacture and sale for general use of effective insecticides such as D.D.T., there has been a considerable reduction in the number of infested houses in the borough. The Council have, therefore, discontinued their policy of treating with H.C.N. the furniture of all incoming tenants of new flats, irrespective of whether there was evidence of infestation or not. The present scheme provides for the Council's Chief Housing Officer to notify the Medical Officer of Health in advance of the names and addresses of prospective tenants, and inspections of the furniture and effects at the old homes are made by a public health inspector. If infestation is found, the contents of the home are collected by the Council's staff, disinfested at Wood Lane with H.C.N, and then taken to the new flat. If no infestation is found, the prospective tenant is allowed to move in directly to the new flat. In all cases, the walls and ducts of the new flats are treated with Gammexane smoke generators (B.H.C.) as a preventive measure. During 1961, 178 new flats and 9 converted properties became ready for occupation. In 7 cases the furniture of families selected to move into these Council flats (or conversions) was found to be infested and was treated with H.C.N, at the disinfecting station. - 14 - COMBINED DISINFECTING STATION AND MEDICINAL BATHS The disinfecting station at Wood Lane was built and equipped in 1906 and the original equipment then installed is still in use today. Additions were made in 1934, when a hydrogen cyanide gas unit was added for dealing with bug infested furniture, and in 1940, when an additional disinfector was installed. In 1940 the station was severely damaged by enemy action, when practically the whole of one side of the building was destroyed. The other side also received severe damage, so much so that if it is to remain on its existing site, there is no doubt that the greater part of the building will have to be demolished to its foundation and rebuilt. In view of this, only "first aid" and temporary repairs, with a minimum of decoration, have been undertaken during the past twenty years. Disinfection and disinfestation of infected and infested articles are best performed in a single building as part of a wider service which includes the cleansing of persons and the treatment of scabies. In many London boroughs this is the case, for such an arrangement enables both services to be carried out with economy and allows for an interchangeability of duties amongst the staff. The Borough Engineer prepared a scheme to combine the disinfecting station and the medicinal baths on a site adjoining the public baths in Lancaster Road. The scheme is for a single-storey building with vehicular access from Blechynden Mews and pedestrian access, both for the staff and the public, on the Silchester Road frontage. Provision is being made for one disinfector at Wood Lane, and for the disinfector in the medicinal baths to be re-used. The drying tumbler recently bought for Wood Lane will also be refixed. The rest of the laundry equipment will be new and will consist of a steam-heated ironing machine, two washing machines, one hydro-extractor and three hair driers. The estimated cost is £36,368. This includes the acquisition of premises, but does not include a credit for the converted value payment for the war-damaged disinfecting station which is likely to be about £6,390; nor does it take into account the substantial value of the present site at Wood Lane depot occupied by the disinfecting and disinfestation buildings. There would also be the savings on staff and services estimated at £1,400 per annum, as a result of combining the two services. The scheme has been approved by the Council and it is hoped that the new building will be in use early in 1963• PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, imposes a duty on occupiers of premises to notify the Council of rodent infestation, and the Council are required to ensure that the borough is, as far as practicable, kept free from rats and mice. The Council deal with rat and mice infestation in dwelling houses without cost to the occupiers, but expenditure incurred in treating infestations on commercial and industrial premises is recovered from the owners. The Council are required to submit reports on (i) the extent of infestation, (ii) special circumstances to which any undue presence of rats and mice might be attributed, and (iii) the nature and extent of co-operative working with contiguous local authorities. - 15 - The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food requested a report for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1961 in the following form:- Prevalence of Rats and Mice. Type of Property Local Authority Dwelling Houses All other (including Business & Industrial) Total I. Total number of properties in Local Authority's district 51 40,138 10,949 51,118 II.

Number of "block" control schemes carried out - - - - - 16 - For a number of years, all the sewers in the borough have been treated with poison bait, to destroy rats, twice yearly. This work had, up to 1957, been carried out in January and June each year, coinciding with similar treatments carried out in neighbouring boroughs. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommended in 1957 that a new system of treatment should be introduced, which involved changing the times of baiting to April and September each year, allowing a longer period of time during which baits were left in the sewers, and mixing a mould inhibitor (paranitrophenol) with the baiting material to act as a preservative. The following table shows the results obtained during the year, compared with the results obtained in the previous six years Year Estimated number of rats killed 1st Treatment 2nd Treatment 1955 4,515 3,430 1956 4,764 4,138 1957 4,476 (January) 7,751 (April ) 7,044 (September) 1958 4,945 6,617 1959 6,211 8,082 1960 10,414 5,416 1961 4,243 3,002 The rodent staff deal with infestations from pests other than rats and mice, and the following is a summary of all action taken during the year:- Premises inspected following complaints 1,151 Premises where rats were found 423 Premises where mice were found 663 Premises where other vermin were found 130 Premises where no infestation existed 1 Number of visits made 4,962 Number of successful treatments 1,169 Cases in which advice only was given 47 Borough Council properties dealt with 8 PHARMACY AND POISONS ACT. 1933 At the end of the year the number of sellers of Part II Poisons (other than registered pharmacists) on the list maintained by the Council was 123. Of this number 9 were new registrations during the year. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT. 1951 This Act regulates the use of clean filling materials in upholstered articles and other articles which are stuffed or lined. Subject to certain exceptions, the Act makes it unlawful to use prescribed filling materials except on premises registered by a local authority. The exceptions are in the remaking and reconditioning of any article or upholstering in connection with the making of railway carriages, road vehicles, ships or aircraft. The local authority are required, on the application of the occupier of premises, to register the premises on payment of a registration fee of One Pound. At the end of the year, there were 19 registered premises in the borough. The Act further provides that no rag flock shall be delivered to registered premises except from premises licensed for manufacturing rag flock or used as a store for rag flock. A local authority on receiving from the occupier of premises an application for the grant or renewal of an annual licence authorising him to manufacture rag flock or to use his premises as a rag flock store, may grant or renew the licence on payment of a fee of One Pound. No licences have been issued in Kensington. - 17 - If on registered premises there are unclean filling materials, the occupier shall be guilty of an offence; and it is also an offence to sell or offer for sale any article which is upholstered with unclean filling materials (second-hand articles are excepted). Inspections of the registered premises were made during the year, and 6 samples of rag flock and other fillings were taken for analysis. The results were satisfactory with the exception of a sample of woollen mixture felt. This was found to contain 45 parts of chlorine per 100,000, whereas the permitted maximum is 30. Appropriate warnings were given in this case. Description No. of samples Algerian Fibre 1 Cotton Felt 3 Woollen mixture felt 2 PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 This Act requires that no person shall keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence issued by the Council and in compliance with any conditions specified in the licence. During the year, 9 premises were licensed under the Act. The general conditions for pet shops approved by the Council are those recommended for their constituent councils by the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee. HEALTH EDUCATION Health education is an important activity and forms an integral part of the National Health Service. For many years the Council have made an annual grant to the Central Council for Health Education, which is the body recognised by the Minister of Health as the medium through which health education material is distributed throughout England and Wales. For the year 196l/62, the Council made a grant of £23. 0s. 0d. Good use was made of the services available, and posters, leaflets and other material (including copies of "Better Health") were obtained from the Central Council for distribution in Kensington During the year three of the six ex-Empire Marketing Board poster frames still in use were replaced by modern but smaller boards upon which four double-crown posters (size 30" x 20") can be displayed. Posters dealing with a variety of health topics were displayed at regular intervals during the year on the poster boards available throughout the borough, and leaflets dealing with health education were distributed. HOME SAFETY The Home Safety Act, 1961, empowers local authorities to make arrangements for the dissemination of information and advice relating to the prevention of accidents in the home, and activities under this heading are combined with the work of health education. - 18 - ACCIDENTS IN THE HOME The London County Council, which is the Ambulance authority, have been keeping records of home accident cases (both fatal and nonfatal) removed to hospital by them. The Medical Officer for the County Council has very kindly supplied me with the following figures for 1961. It has not been possible to give details of cases by cause in age groups; nor any differentiation between male and female for the borough. The figures relate to Health Division 1 of which Kensington forms a part together with Chelsea, Fulham and Hammersmith.

The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Act, 1952 was repealed but the Regulations made thereunder are continued in force. It is an offence to sell any gas or electric fire, or oil heater, suitable for use in residential premises, unless it is fitted with an adequate guard. Generally speaking, traders do not commit offences under the Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations, but it is necessary to keep a careful watch on the sale of second-hand appliances from stalls in public markets. Oil Heaters In the early part of the year, a letter was received from the Association of Municipal Corporations suggesting that local authorities should consider taking steps to publicise the dangers from oil heaters which had not been adapted to comply with the standards agreed between the Home Office and manufacturers. The Public Health Committee instructed that publicity be given during the summer months to these dangers and to the need to check oil heaters for safeness before the onset of winter. A bookmark was devised in the department and the Central Council for Health Education arranged for the printing of ten thousand copies which were placed in the Council's libraries. Seven thousand leaflets relating to the care and handling of oil heaters were obtained from the Fire Protection Association and the London County Council and were distributed to various organisations in the borough. The Women's Voluntary Services assisted by distributing the leaflets to old people with their meals-on-wheels and library books. The "National Fire Prevention Week" held later in the year gave an opportunity to follow up this activity. "National Fire Prevention Week" "National Fire Prevention Week" was held in the first week of November in place of the usual Home Safety Week. The sponsors were the Fire Protection Association and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. In support of their publicity on a national scale they asked Fire Authorities to organise local campaigns. The Public Health Committee agreed to co-operate with the London County Council in the distribution of publicity material relating to prevention of fires in the home. Posters and leaflets were sent to youth clubs, old people's clubs, large business houses, industrial concerns, voluntary organisations, hospitals, etc. in the borough. A display unit obtained from the London Fire Brigade during the campaign week, was placed in the main hallway of the Town Hall. In the month following, the unit was placed in the main entrance of the Central Library and later transferred to the North Kensington Branch Library at Ladbroke Grove, W.ll. HEALTH HANDBOOK The Council approved the printing by a commercial firm of a "Health and Social Services" Handbook for the use of official and voluntary bodies and members of the general public in Kensington. 20 When the handbooks were distributed, an advisory leaflet giving information of the services to old people and a list of addresses of government departments, voluntary organisations, etc. in the borough, were included with each book. Copies of the handbook were sent to all members of the Council, local Members of Parliament and the London County Council, hospitals, general practitioners, dentists, chemists, clergy, child welfare centres, day nurseries, old people's clubs, etc. Ratepayers applying at the Town Hall (information Office), Public Health Department or the Citizens" Advice Bureau were also supplied with a free copy. MASS RADIOGRAPHY Mass radiography is undertaken on behalf of the Minister of Health by the Regional Hospital Boards. Kensington is included in the area covered by the Mass X-ray Unit No.5A operated by the North-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board from 285, Harrow Road, W.9. The purpose of mass radiography is twofold:- (i) to find abnormalities of the chest and in particular tuberculosis and cancer of the lungs, and (ii) to give those whose X-ray is within "normal limit" a certain degree of security. The number of persons X-rayed by the Unit during surveys held in Kensington in 1961 totalled 1,357. A provisional analysis of the surveys revealed three cases of active tuberculosis. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION Clean Air Act,, 1956. Certain provisions of the Clean Air Act, 1956, which received Royal Assent on 5th July, 1956, came into force on 31st December, 1956, and the remaining provisions came into operation on 1st June, 1958. Smoke Control Areas. Sections 11 to 15 of the Act relate to the functions of the Council to declare smoke control areas, in which the emission of smoke from the chimney of any building would be an offence. The procedure for establishing a smoke control area is laid down by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. Circular l/61, dated 16th January, 1961, pointed out that, under the present procedure for establishing smoke control areas, local authorities who have decided in principle to declare an area, are required to notify the Minister so that he can give a warning if, in his view, the proposals should for any reason be modified. The Minister stated that considerable experience has now been gained, and he does not consider that there is any longer a need for provisional proposals to be referred to him before smoke control orders are formally submitted for approval. In future, therefore, local authorities in the "black" areas (these include London) will not be required to submit provisional proposals before making smoke control orders. 21 In 1959, the Minister of Housing and Local Government requested local authorities, especially in "black areas", to prepare a phased five-year programme for establishing smoke control areas. The Council adopted the following programme:- Smoke Control Area Boundaries Preliminary Survey Detailed Survey & Order Made Order operative Holland Ward (No.l) N.

It has an area of about 83 acres and contains 2,932 buildings. The Council, under Section 11(3) of the Clean Air Act, 1956, exempted from the provisions of this Order the basement of 214, Westbourne Grove which is used for the manufacture of smoked sausages. The process employed is traditional and the emission of smoke is inevitable. From the detailed survey it was estimated that the total cost of adaptations will be £13,491, of which, after deducting Exchequer grant, the owners (or occupiers) and the Council will each be liable for £4,047. No objections to the Order were received and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government confirmed the Order without modification and fixed 1st October, 1962 as the date on which it will come into operation. The Council further agreed to deal with the next area, Norland Ward (No.1) Area, which is that part of the ward bounded on the North by the middle of Lancaster Road, on the East by the middle of Ladbroke Grove, on the South by the middle of Holland Park Avenue, and on the West by the middle of Walmer Road and Princedale Road. It has an area of about 100 acres. New furnaces. Section 3 requires that new furnaces, not used mainly for domestic purposes and exceeding a specified capacity, shall be so far as is practicable smokeless. Any person installing such a furnace must give prior notice to the Council and may submit detailed plans and specifications for approval before the work of installation takes place. During 1961 16 notifications were received, and one application for approval of plans, etc., was approved. In one instance it was reported that a new furnace had been installed in a building without proper notice being given to the Council, and the Public Health Committee decided to issue a warning in this case. Smoke emissions. The Sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956 which relate to industrial smoke came into force on 1st June, 1958. Up to that date emissions of industrial smoke were dealt with under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. The provisions mainly affecting the Council are contained in Section 1, which prohibits the emission of dark smoke (except for certain periods laid down by regulation) and Section 16 which deals with smoke nuisances. During the year 17 complaints of smoke nuisance were received and 19 formal smoke observations were carried out. Remedial measures in all cases were secured without further proceedings. 23 Routine measurement of atmospheric pollution. The Council maintain two atmospheric pollution measuring stations as follows:- (1) North Kensington (St. Joseph's Convent, Portobello Road) (2) South Kensington (Messrs. John Barker's Furniture Depository, Pembroke Road). The apparatus at each station consists of a standard deposit gauge for collecting soluble and insoluble deposits, and a lead peroxide apparatus for measuring the sulphur content of the air. Readings are taken at each station at the end of each month. In addition to the above mentioned stations, the Council have established three smoke measuring stations as follows:- (1) Public Health Department, Hornton Street, W.8. (2) Public Library, Ladbroke Grove, W.10. (3) L.C.C. Child Welfare Centre, Redcliffe Street, S.W.10. The equipment at the Public Health Department consists of a smoke filter and a hydrogen peroxide bubbling apparatus. The smoke filter measures the daily concentration of smoke suspended in the atmosphere, and the hydrogen peroxide bubbler extracts the sulphur dioxide content of the atmosphere. Readings are taken each day, and the results are averaged to produce figures for each calendar month. The equipment at the Public Library and the Welfare Centre consists of smoke filters only. Measurements are taken three times a week, and daily and monthly averages are calculated from the results. The following tables set out details of the results obtained in Kensington during 1961 - 24 A. Deposit Gauges. Month 1961 Days Exposed Rainfall (ins.)

General observations. Whilst it is too early to assess whether the atmosphere in Kensington is generally better as a result of the Council's efforts in promoting smoke control areas, it is certainly gratifying to see from the above figures that in the last seven years the measurement of deposited matter in tons per square mile on a monthly average basis has been reduced, in the case of North Kensington, from 18.98 to 8.83 and, in the case of South Kensington from 15.98 to 10.61. There are, of course, other factors to take into consideration and it is unwise to express opinions on figures obtained locally in comparatively small areas. 26 The wort undertaken by the Public Health Department is a small part of that taking place throughout the country, and. all results obtained in Kensington are forwarded to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for correlation with results obtained in all other districts. In this connection it is a matter of interest that at the request of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research the Council use a Reflectometer for measuring the amount of atmospheric pollution recorded by the filter papers at the three smoke measuring stations maintained in the borough by the Council. This instrument enables greater accuracy to be obtained and eliminates the possibility of human error. NOISE ABATEMENT ACT. 1960 This Act came into operation on 27th November, 1960. Under Section 1 any noise or vibration which would amount to a nuisance at common law is deemed to be a statutory nuisance which can be dealt with according to the procedure provided in Part III of the Public Health Act, 1936. In London, Section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937 has for many years given Metropolitan Borough Councils power to deal with noise as a nuisance under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, where a person made or caused to be made or continued an excessive or unreasonable or unnecessary noise which was injurious or dangerous to health. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960 amended this Section to conform with the new meaning of noise nuisance. Local authorities are now able to require the abatement of a noise or vibration nuisance (not necessarily injurious or dangerous to health) by the service of an abatement Notice on the person causing the nuisance and, if the Notice is not complied with, it can be enforced by proceedings in a Magistrate's Court. Apart from action by a local authority, any three or more occupiers of land or premises who are aggrieved by a noise or vibration nuisance may make complaint direct to a Magistrate. Complaints are received in the department from time to time regarding noise nuisances, mainly arising as a result of industrial work. In all cases, during 1961 remedies were secured without recourse to legal action. It should be noted that, in the case of noise or vibration caused in the course of a trade or business, it is a defence in any proceedings to show that the best practicable means have been used for preventing it and counteracting its effect. Section 2 of the Act deals with the use of loudspeakers in streets. It prohibits their use for any purpose between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m. except in the special circumstances defined in sub-section 2 of the section, and at any other time for advertising any trade, business or entertainment, with the exception that between noon and 7 p.m. a loudspeaker fixed to a vehicle used for the sale of perishable foodstuffs may be operated to announce that the commodities are on sale: the loudspeaker is, however, not to be so operated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the vicinity. During the year the Council instituted proceedings in three cases for offences under this section. Convictions were obtained and fines totalling £3.10s. 0d. with 10/6d. costs were imposed. 27 PUBLIC BATHS The Minister of Health (Circular l/60) has requested that reference should be made to any public swimming baths in the borough. The Council have provided indoor swimming pools at the Public Baths situated in North Kensington at the junction of Lancaster Road and Silchester Road. The original building was constructed about seventy years ago and no major structural alterations have since taken place. There were four swimming pools, two of which have now been discontinued. The swimming pools now available are as follows:- (1) The large mixed swimming pool. (2) The small mixed swimming pool. The large pool has an area of approximately 4,500 sq. ft. and the smaller one is one-third of this area. Both pools are available for swimming in the summer months mid-April to mid-October, but during the winter months only the large pool will be available to the public. The water used for swimming is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board's supply at the commencement of the bathing season, and throughout the season it is treated by a continuous filtration system. Low pressure sand filters were installed in 1927 and a continuous chlorination equipment added several years later. This plant is now worn out, and new equipment embodying the latest improvements was substituted during the winter of 1959/60. The filtration process consists of drawing water from the deep end of the pool through a suitable strainer and, after the addition of coagulants to flocculate organic matter and to obtain efficient filtration, the water is pumped to the top of four Vertical Air-Scoured Pressure Filters. The water, before filtration, is sterilised; this is done by introducing chlorinated water into the circulating flow from "Wallace & Tiernan" Automatic Residual Chlorine Control equipment, with hydraulic solution feeder for automatic pH Control. This gives an accurate method of controlling the dosage. The chlorinator automatically injects water chlorinated to the correct strength and at the same time adjusts the doses to suit varying bathing loads. The amount of chlorination provided operates on the principle of "breakpoint chlorination" and is recorded on a chart from which the degree of sterilisation of the water is known at any time during the swimming season. The filter units consist of vertical closed cylinders containing graded Non-Friable Leighton Buzzard Sand supported on a bed of graded granite chippings, through which the water passes at a rate of 230 gallons per square foot of filter area per hour. The sand has to be washed regularly - this is done by steam and air agitation and reversing the flow of water, which runs to waste and carries impurities with it. Water taken from the pools is used for the washing process. The filtered water is then aerated, thereby assisting in the maintenance of bacterial purity. It is then heated by calorifiers to about 75°F. It re-enters the swimming pools through suitable inlets at the shallow ends, and scum troughs have been provided on the sides of the pools which draw off any pollution which may accumulate near the surface, together with any dust which settles thereon. 28 The new equipment has been designed to give a turnover period up to 3½ hours, which is about twice that obtained from the old plant. By this means, quicker purification of water is obtained and is particularly beneficial during peak periods. The whole of the new equipment has been designed to comply with the latest recommendations of the Ministry of Health for indoor swimming pools. Samples of water in the pools are taken from time to time, and during 1961 the results obtained were well within the bacteriological standards recommended by the Ministry of Health. The residual chlorine similarly was maintained within the concentration advocated. During the last eighteen months the pools have been altered to give a greater depth of water at the deep ends, which is an advantage to divers, and the floors at the shallow ends raised so that the water is not too deep for children. Additional cleansing and lavatory facilities have been provided for the public using the pools. PUBLIC MORTUARY For many years, the Council maintained a public mortuary at No.la, Hornton Place, W.8. From 15th April, 1958, the Coroner decided that all bodies of persons dying within Kensington coming under his jurisdiction should be taken to the Hammersmith Mortuary, which adjoins the West London Coroner's Court. Consequently, the Council decided to close their premises and made an arrangement with the Hammersmith Borough Council that all Kensington cases should be accommodated in the Hammersmith Mortuary. The agreement provides that an annual payment of £500 shall be made for this service. Details regarding the number of Kensington cases admitted during 1961 to the Hammersmith Public Mortuary in accordance with the agreement are as follows:- By Order of Coroner 395 By Order of Police Nil On application of Undertaker 9 404 BURIAL OF THE DEAD Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, imposes on the Council the duty to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies, or is found dead, within the borough, where no suitable private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. The Council have authorised the Medical Officer of Health to make arrangements for the burial of any person to whom the Section applies. In the twelve months ended 31st December, 1961, the Council became responsible for the burial of 44 persons dying in the borough. The following is a summary of the action taken:- (a) Cases where the funeral expenses have been fully recovered 29 29 (b) Cases where part only of the expenses has been recovered 6 (i) Number of these where balance of expenses will be rec0overed 1 (amounting to £4.10s. 0d.) (ii) Number of these where there was no further estate or "liable" relative 4 (iii) Number of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 1 (c) Cases where full cost has been borne by the Council 9 (i) Number of these where expenses will be recovered 2 (amounting to £34. 0. 0d.) (ii) Number of these where there was no estate or "liable" relative 1 (iii) Number of these where "liable" relatives were unable to contribute 6 Amount recovered by the end of the year £540. 7s. 1d. Additional amount expected to be recovered £38.10s. 0d. £578.17s. 1d. Irrecoverable 116. 1s. 2d. Total cost £694.18s. 3d. Of the forty-four cases dealt with, twenty-eight were eligible for Death Grant from the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance. The total amount recovered from this source amounted to £409. 5s. 0d. (included in the above figures). Since the National Assistance Act came into force on 5th July, 1948, the Council have arranged for the burial of 509 persons under Section 50. BOROUGH CREMATION SERVICE The Council have an arrangement with the General Cemetery Company who own the Kensal Green Crematorium at the north-west corner of the borough, whereby a reduced charge of Five Guineas is made for the cremation of Kensington residents, subject to certain financial conditions. In 1961 there were 331 Kensington cremations, in comparison with 291 in 1960 and 273 in 1959. These figures compare with only 60 Kensington cremations in 1948 (prior to the arrangement coming into effect). MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS OF STAFF The Medical Officer of Health arranges all medical examinations of staff for the purposes of the Borough Council's Superannuation Scheme. During the year 160 examinations were made. 30 DOG NUISANCES Apart from being an objectionable social offence, fouling of footways by dogs is a public health nuisance for which an adequate remedy is hard to find. While it has been shown that dogs can carry and excrete germs capable of producing illness in man, it is seldom that cases of human disease can positively be related to infections originating from this source. Nevertheless, such instances do occur and the potential risk cannot be ignored. Certainly dog filth is an attraction to flies and blowflies, with consequent possibilities of conveyance of infection. The main objection, however, to the fouling of pavements and grass verges by dog excreta is the nauseating revulsion, embarrassment and distress caused by chance pollution of shoes, clothing, mats and carpets, necessitating disgusting and time-consuming cleansing operations. The Council's byelaw dealing with this nuisance provides that:- "No person being in charge of a dog shall allow the animal to foul the footway of any street or public place by depositing its excrement thereon. For the purposes of this byelaw the owner of the dog shall be deemed to be in charge thereof, unless the Court is satisfied that at the time when the dog fouled the footway it had been placed in or taken into the charge of some other person." During the year two prosecutions were taken under this byelaw. Convictions were secured in both cases and fines amounting to £1. 0s. 0d., with £1.11s. 6d. costs, were imposed. WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE The Council have accepted the responsibility, within their powers, for co-ordinating and assisting in the extension of activities for aged persons and to alleviate unsatisfactory conditions under which many old people are living. Co-operation with voluntary bodies interested in the welfare of old people is effected wherever possible. In order that action taken shall be uniform, the Kensington Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee act as an intermediary between the Council and the voluntary bodies. Four members of the Public Health Committee serve on the Old People's Welfare Voluntary Committee which acts as a co-ordinating non-executive Committee through which voluntary bodies claim assistance from the Council and through which the Council pass requests for executive action. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government and the Ministry of Health issued a joint circular requesting local authorities to consider how to improve the provision made for the well-being of old people. The circular, which outlined the various services provided, was considered by the Public Health Committee in April, 1961, who were satisfied that the functions, which can be properly carried out by a metropolitan borough, were being administered in Kensington substantially in accordance with the suggestions made in the circular. 31 Advice Leaflets The Council arrange for the distribution of copies of a pamphlet giving information on the services available to old people individually or through a club. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance made arrangements, as from 31st January, 1961, to send to every person in London reaching retirement pension age, a leaflet giving general information on welfare services for old people. This action was initiated by the London County Council Central Consultative Committee on the Welfare of Old People, which has the support of Old People's Welfare Committees in all metropolitan boroughs. Each Old People's Welfare Committee is responsible for the cost of printing these leaflets but,as they are basically similar for each borough, costs have been low, and the initial supply for each borough will not cost more than £4. These leaflets are not intended to replace the informative pamphlets issued by the Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee, but to ensure that the services are brought to the notice of people when they first become pensioners. S.O.S. Cards Window display cards are provided by the Council, bearing the letters "S.O.S." in red on one side, and on the reverse side directions how to use the card, with space for particulars of next-of-kin or nearest relative. These cards are distributed to appropriate old people. Any person seeing one of the cards in a window is able to summon help from one of the sources given on the back of the card. The local press have generously assisted in making this service known. Grants to Clubs, etc. Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council can make contributions to voluntary bodies whose activities include the provision of recreation or meals for old people. During the year grants were made as follows:- (a) The Kensington Communal Kitchen Service were granted £500 as a contribution towards the cost of operating a Meals-on-Wheels service in co-operation with the Kensington Women's Voluntary Services. (b) The West London Old Age Pensioners' Angling Competition Committee were granted £5 towards the cost of their annual competition. (c) The Merrymakers Old People's Club, at the Community Centre, Dalgarno Gardens, were granted £12 towards the purchase of equipment and the replacement of crockery. (d) The Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee which acts as a co-ordinating Committee through which the various voluntary bodies can ask for assistance from the Council, were granted £35 to assist in meeting their general expenditure which had, up to this year, been financed by the Kensington Council of Social Service. 32 (e) The Home from Home Club, at The Quest, 85, Clarendon Road, were granted £12, 9s. Od. towards the cost of purchasing cutlery. (f) The Home from Home Club (previously at the Royal Palace Hotel), organised by the Women's Voluntary Services, re-opened at St. Mary Abbot's Vicarage during the year. A grant not exceeding £60 was authorised towards meeting the running costs. Holidays Since April, 1951, the Council, in co-operation with the Family Welfare Association, have operated a scheme for providing holidays for old people. During 1961, a block booking of sixty places was made on the ground and first floors of Lennox House Holiday Home, Southsea, for the months of May and June; and forty-eight places were booked with the Ramsgate and District Hotel and Boarding House Association for the period May to June, and thirty for September. The terms quoted for Lennox House were £4.10s. 0d. per week, and for Ramsgate £4. 7s. 6d. per week. Private coaches were hired to take the old people to and from these homes and convenient assembly points in the borough were arranged. As in other years, applications for holidays were investigated by the Woman Health Officer, approved by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and were then passed to the Family Welfare Association for the holiday arrangements. A sum of five shillings per booking was paid to the Family Welfare Association towards their administration expenses. Each applicant is required to pay £2 per week towards the cost of the holiday, unless this payment is abated on the authority of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee. There was no case in which difficulty in making this payment occurred, and the holiday scheme was successfully carried out. The following is a summary of the action taken during 1961:- Total number of old people who applied 163 Considered unsuitable on medical grounds 6 Referred to L.C.C. for recuperative holidays 4 10 Number of applications approved by the Chairman 153 Cancellations after approval 17 136 Number sent on holiday To Lennox House, Southsea 58 To Ramsgate 78 Total 136 33 Cost of holidays £ s. d. Board and lodging fees and fares 1,357 12. 10. Booking fees paid to Family Welfare Association 28. 5 0. 1,385 17. 10. Less contributions by applicants 5.5. 5. 0. Actual cost to Council 8.0. 12. 10. In each case the holiday was for a period of two weeks. Letters of appreciation have been received from the old people concerned and all those participating expressed their utmost satisfaction when seen by the Woman Health Officer on their return home. Institutional and Domiciliary Care of the Aged Sick Facilities for institutional care, home nursing, sick room equipment and home helps are provided by the London County Council. Hospital treatment, medical care, ophthalmic, dental and pharmaceutical services are provided under statute by the Minister of Health. The borough is situated in the area of two Metropolitan Regional Hospital Boards. One Hospital Management Committee in the northern portion of the borough utilizes the part-time service of a local medical practitioner as a clinical assessor to decide the priority need for admission of all patients submitted to that Hospital Group as being in need of hospital treatment and classed as "chronic sick." Cases on the chronic sick waiting lists of St. Mary Abbots Hospital in the borough are referred to the Public Health Department. They are visited and assessed by the women health officers. This ensures the early or immediate admission of patients where the need is urgent on medico/social grounds. There is usually no difficulty in the admission to hospital for the treatment of acute conditions. Where necessary, medical care, home nursing, home helps, convalescent holidays, financial aid and pensions are arranged with the appropriate statutory bodies. These, together with various services operated by the Council augmented by voluntary bodies, are provided to such good effect that, in many cases, the need for hospital admission is postponed indefinitely. The number of "chronic sick" visits by the women health officers during the year totalled 668. During the year it was possible to arrange for 36 old people to be admitted to hospitals for institutional treatment and, in addition, 34 cases were admitted to homes for the aged. Domiciliary Cleansing Arrangements have been made whereby old people's living accommodation and household articles are cleansed and, if necessary, disinfested. Three old people were dealt with in 1961. Laundry At present no direct authority exists for the Council to provide a laundry service, as such, for old people. Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, enables the Council to cause any article in the house to be cleansed, disinfected or destroyed, if it is in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby. The cleansing of grossly fouled bedding in cases of incontinence may be dealt with under this Section. 34 To comply with the legal requirements, the Council have given a general authority to the Medical Officer of Health to take whatever action appears to him to be necessary under the terms of Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In 73 cases action was taken under the Section. The bedding was marked, laundered at the Council's disinfecting station and returned to the old people. The scheme works smoothly and appears to fill a much felt want. Prom stocks of bedding held, the Council are able to supply linen and bedding on loan to old people while their own is being laundered, and where possible voluntary organisations are asked to undertake replacements of much worn articles. During the year 1,293 separate collections of laundry were made under this scheme, and the number of articles cleansed totalled 16,291. Library Facilities The Libraries Committee co-operates in providing books for old people confined to their homes. The circulation of the books is effected by the Women's Voluntary Services mobile library. Chiropody The London County Council, with the approval of the Minister of Health, extended their functions under Section 28 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, to include a chiropody service, giving priority to the needs of old people, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. They make a grant to the Kensington Old People's Welfare Committee for the purpose of enabling the provision of a chiropody service for housebound old people. The Kensington Branch of the British Red Cross Society have accepted responsibility for the complete administration of the service in the borough, and all the patients are referred to them through the Public Health Department. The total number of persons treated under the home chiropody scheme was 315» and the number of treatments given was 720. Meals Service The arrangements for meals either delivered to old people in their homes or in canteens were continued with great success by the Women's Voluntary Services in conjunction with the Kensington Communal Services Committee. The Women's Voluntary Services undertake the work of verifying the bona fides of applicants, arrange delivery of meals at the homes of old people and collect the money (lOd. per meal). The Kensington Communal Services Committee supply the meals and the vehicles for delivery. The following statement shows the progress of the service and financial effect since the inception of the scheme:- 35 Period Number of Meals Gross Cost Receipts from old people Subsidy from L.C.C.

The net deficiencies of the scheme (after crediting subsidies from the London County Council and grants from the Kensington Council) have been met to date by the Kensington Communal Services Committee. Under Section 31 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council have power to make grants to voluntary bodies undertaking the supply of meals to old people and a grant of £500 was made to the Kensington Communal Services Committee for 1961/62. Visiting The Council's women health officers visit old people brought to their notice. A comprehensive record system is kept of old people in the borough including personal particulars, environmental conditions and special needs. The local voluntary organisations supply records of old people whom they help and every endeavour is made to keep this information up to date. The following is a summary of the work carried out by the Council's women health officers in connection with the care of old people during the year 1961:- Cases on register at the beginning of year 5,189 New cases added to register 615 Cases removed to hospital 36 Cases removed to homes (voluntarily) 33 Cases removed to homes (compulsorily) 1 Cases removed from district 266 Number of deaths 346 Total number of cases remaining on register at end of year 5,122 Number of old people sent away for holiday 136 Number of old people provided with Council's laundry service 73 Number of old people provided with "Meals on Wheels" 220 Cases referred to National Assistance Board 133 Cases referred for assistance from Home Help Department 154 Cases referred for assistance from Voluntary Organisations 111 36 Cases referred to Recreational Clubs 165 Number of visits to chronic sick cases 668 Cases assisted with provision of medical and nursing care 85 Cases referred to home chiropody service 154 Cases where disinfestation was carried out 3 Number of initial home visits made 508 Number of re-visits 3,392 Number of other visits made in connection with old people, including visits to clubs 102 Number of interviews, enquiries, etc. on behalf of old people 2,105 Removal of old and infirm persons to institutions, etc. Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council may apply to a Court for an order to remove to a suitable institution any person who - (a) is suffering from grave chronic disease, or being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, is living in insanitary conditions, and (b) is unable to devote to himself, or is not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. The National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, amended Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, and provided that application for removal of urgent cases may-be made by the local authority or by the Medical Officer of Health, if authorised by the Council to do so, without giving seven days' notice as previously required. Such applications may be made either to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction or to a single Justice, on a certificate by the Medical Officer of Health and another registered medical practitioner. Further, where the hospital or institution agree to receive the case, it is not necessary to give seven days' notice to the manager thereof. Detention Orders made in respect of these urgent cases are limited to three weeks, and if it is necessary to extend this time, compliance must be made with the original requirements of Section 47. Although many cases of old people were investigated during the year, in only one case was formal action taken to secure compulsory removal to an institution. This case was a woman, aged 77 years, living alone in insanitary conditions in one room. She was gravely ill and unable to devote to herself proper care and attention. She persistently refused all endeavours to persuade her to enter a hospital to undergo proper medical treatment. A Justice's Order was, therefore, obtained and she was removed to St. Charles Hospital, where she still refused treatment and died shortly after admission. THE GENERAL DRAINAGE AND SEVER SYSTEM The drainage system in the Metropolitan Boroughs is a combined one whereby surface water and foul water both enter the same sewers. In most cases houses are connected direct to borough council sewers, and these in turn discharge into the London County Council main sewers. In a few cases, where local sewers do not exist, house connections are taken direct into the main sewers. 37 SANITARY INSPECTION The following table shows a summary of the inspections, etc. carried, out by the public health inspectors and their assistants during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Houses inspected on complaint 2,679 Houses inspected after infectious disease 1,902 Re-inspections 7,410 Smoke observations 19 Other inspections 1,964 Housing Act, 1957 Initial inspection of dwelling houses 191 Re-inspections 417 Initial inspections for overcrowding 470 Re-inspections 640 Underground Living Rooms Initial inspections 982 Re-inspections 3,080 Drainage Applications 447 Plans submitted 378 House drains inspected 8,908 House drains tested 877 Factories Acts 1937-1959 Premises inspected 435 Outworkers' premises inspected 180 Clean Air Act, 1956 Total inspections 5,406 The following table shows the number of notices issued in respect of nuisances, defects, etc., found during the year:- Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Intimation notices 813 Statutory notices 270 Final notices 116 Various Factories Acts 6 Report of waste water to the Metropolitan Water Board 21 Report of dangerous structures to the London County Council 20 Other notices 59 38 The following is a summary of the principal works completed under the supervision of the public health inspectors during the year:- House drains, reconstructed or repaired 163 House drains cleansed 146 Water closets, reconstructed or repaired 80 Water closets, new provided 334 Soil pipes, vent pipes, repaired etc 47 Soil pipes, vent pipes, new provided 109 Baths, new provided 285 Sinks, new provided 212 Lavatory basins, new provided 541 Bidets, new provided 20 Waste pipes, new provided 238 Cisterns, cleansed 4 Dustbins provided 59 Accumulations of filth, etc. removed 147 Roofs repaired 147 Dampness in dwellings remedied 189 Artificial lighting to staircases provided 7 Houses disinfected after infectious disease (including bedding, etc.) 185 Rooms in such houses, disinfected after infectious disease 291 Houses cleansed 4 Verminous houses cleansed (including bedding, clothing, etc.) 584 Verminous rooms in such houses, cleansed 1,544 Other sanitary works executed 325 HOUSING Inspection of dwelling houses during the year (i) (a) Dwelling houses inspected for housing defects (under Public Health or Housing Act) 8,188 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 28,643 (ii) (a) Dwelling houses (including those under sub-head (i) above) which were inspected and recorded under the Housing Consolidated Regulations, 1925 191 (b) Inspections made for the purpose 608 (iii) Dwelling houses found not to be in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation 880 Remedy of defects without service of formal notices Number of defective dwelling houses rendered fit in consequence of informal action under the Housing or Public Health Acts 610 Action tinder statutory powers during the year (a) Premises repaired after service of formal notice under the Public Health (London) Act:- (1) By owners 263 (ii) By local authority in default 7 39 (b) Action under Sections 9, 10 and 12 of the Housing Act, 1957:— (i) Dwelling houses in respect of which notices under Section 9 were served requiring repairs 3 (ii) Dwelling houses which were rendered fit by owners under Section 9 1 (iii) Dwelling houses rendered fit by the Council in default of owners -

The following is a short summary of the procedure:- The standard of repair is to be such as will secure the remedying of defects which ought reasonably to be remedied having due regard to the age, character and locality of the dwelling. The first stage is the tenant must serve a notice on his landlord specifying the defects which he thinks should be remedied. The landlord has six weeks in which to do the work or give an undertaking that the work will be done. If he does neither of these things, the tenant may apply to the Council for a certificate of disrepair. When the Council have decided whether any, or all of the items specified by the tenant, justifies the issue of a certificate of disrepair, they must notify the landlord and allow him three weeks to reconsider the giving of an undertaking. The Council have a discretion to refuse to accept such an undertaking (and to issue a certificate of disrepair) in certain circumstances. If no undertaking is given and accepted, a certificate of disrepair is issued. The landlord may apply to the Council for cancellation of the certificate if he subsequently does the work. The Council must then ask the tenant if he objects to the cancellation. If he does not object within the three weeks, the certificate must be cancelled. If he does object, it is for the Council to decide whether or not to cancel the certificate. For the tenant, the effect of the granting of a certificate, or of failure to carry out an undertaking within six months of the giving of it, is an abatement of the rent. There is provision for recovery of excess rent by the tenant back to the date of application for the certificate, or the date of the undertaking if there has been no such application. A landlord can appeal to the county court against the decision of the Council to issue a certificate, or to refuse to cancel one; and a tenant has similar rights of appeal. The following is a summary of the action taken under the Rent Act, 1957, during 1961:- PART I - Applications for Certificates of Disrepair Number of applications for certificates 4 Number of decisions not to issue certificates Nil Number of decisions to issue certificates - (a) in respect of some but not all defects 4 (b) in respect of all defects Nil Number of undertakings given by landlords 4 Number of undertakings refused by Council Nil Number of certificates issued 1 41 ellation of Certificates Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 2 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates upheld Nil Certificates cancelled 2 Houses in Multiple Occupation (including hostels) Under Section 90 of the Housing Act, 1957 the Council may serve a notice on the occupier, or the person having the control and management of a house or part of a house, where excessive numbers of persons are accommodated, specifying in relation to any room on the premises the maximum number of persons by whom it is suitable to be occupied for sleeping purposes at any one time, or, if appropriate, that the room is unsuitable to be occupied for sleeping purposes. It will be an offence after the notice has become operative to cause or allow any rooms to be occupied otherwise than in accordance with the notice, or to cause or permit the accommodation to be so occupied that it is not possible to avoid persons of opposite sexes over the age of 12 years ( excluding persons living together as husband and wife) occupying sleeping accommodation in the same room. In the last few years the Council have given very serious consideration to the question of improving tenement houses. The premises affected vary considerably and render impracticable the provision of a single rigid code of requirements applicable to all cases. However, the Council have adopted certain minimum standards of the essential services and amenities which they will consider as satisfactory in appropriate cases. Many attempts have been made to obtain improvements by exercising the Council's powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These attempts, however, have been frequently frustrated, partly because of the difficulty of ascertaining exactly who was the legal owner at any particular time. A further difficulty was the reluctance of some tenants to attend court. Under Section 36 of the Housing Act, 1957, powers were given to the Council to replace the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings which imposed obligations on landlords and tenants to effect the proper maintenance of communal parts of tenement houses. The new powers proved to be an inadequate substitute for the Byelaws . One of the factors mainly accounting for the squalid appearance of these houses was the condition of the entrance halls, the communal staircases and kitchens. The artificial lighting of the halls and staircases was adequate, but the decorations were old and drab. These parts of the houses were seldom swept, with the result that there was an accumulation of litter. Many of the communal kitchens presented an even worse appearance, food refuse having been left about, and little attempt seemed to have been made to clean stoves, sinks or floors. It was doubtful whether the bathrooms were much used, probably owing to lack of hot water, and the condition of many of the water closets indicated lack of normal cleansing. The method of letting produced a great volume of refuse and the number of bins needed could not be housed in the small front areas and cellars. As a result some were kept in the flats and, on collection day, all were brought down and stacked on the front entrance steps. Some refuse was thrown out of rear windows into the areas, where it choked the drains. 42 In 1960 the Council decided to make representations to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee for improvements in the legislation. Further, the Council sent a deputation to the Minister of Housing and Local Government. The problem was recognised by the Government, and on 24th November, 1961 a new Housing Act came into operation providing extensive new powers for dealing with bad living conditions in houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. (It also makes a number of changes in the law affecting condemned houses, improvement grants, town development and housing subsidies.) The new Act provides most of the powers for which the Council were pressing. They fall into four main groups as follows:- (i) An entirely new power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards of management have not been observed. The requirements of this code are prescribed in the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962 which come into operation on 22nd May, 1962. (ii) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and the provision of adequate means of escape from fire. These replaced and extended similar powers formerly exercisable under Section 36 of the Housing Act, 1957. (iii) A new power for local authorities to carry out works themselves in default and recover the cost. (iv) A power, also new, to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house, or part of a house, which is in multiple occupation. The new powers are designed to deal primarily with the worst type of multi-occupied house where nothing less than strong action is likely to achieve results. The new Regulations mentioned in (i) above were laid before Parliament on 5"th April, 1962 and at the time of writing the Public Health Committee are taking steps to implement their provisions in cases of tenement houses which have been the subject of bad management for many years. Part I deals with their application and interpretation, Part II prescribes the duties of management to be discharged by the manager of the house, and Part III deals with ancillary requirements including the provision of information. It also places certain obligations on occupants for the purpose of ensuring that the manager can effectively carry out his duties. Responsibility for management will rest on an owner or lessee who receives the rents or other payments from tenants or lodgers, including any agent or trustee through whom the rents are received. The main substance of the code of management is contained in Part II of the Regulations which deals with the manager's responsibilities for repair and maintenance. Broadly, these responsibilities amount to ensuring the repair (including reasonable decorative repair), cleanliness and good order of the parts of the house in common use; the proper maintenance throughout the house of installations for basic services, such as water supply, drainage, gas and electricity; the repair and good order of all means of ventilation and means of escape from fire. The manager is also required to ensure an adequate provision of refuse bins and to take reasonable precautions to 43 protect tenants from injury as a result of structural conditions in the house. Where rooms are let to tenants or lodgers as their living accommodation, the manager must ensure that the rooms are clean and in a reasonable state of structural repair at the commencement of the letting and that defects are remedied in the rooms which are already let, when the Regulations are applied to a house. There is a continuing obligation for the repair and proper working order of installations in the rooms, for the supply of water, gas and electricity as well as baths, sinks, basins and sanitary conveniences. In Part III of the Regulations a general obligation is placed on occupants to take reasonable care not to hinder the manager in carrying out his duties. Regulation 14 requires the manager to display in a suitable position in the house a notice containing his name and address and that of any other manager with an indication of his interest (i.e. agent or trustee), a copy of the Management Order, a copy of the Regulations and, if the local authority require, a notice which the authority may provide for indicating briefly the main provisions of the Regulations. The new Regulations do not stand in isolation, and they must be taken together with existing powers under the Housing Act, 1957, and the new powers contained in the 1961 Act relating to the provision of additional services and facilities and the prevention or reduction of overcrowding. It is likely that there will be houses where Orders applying a code of management prescribed in the Regulations will be all that are necessary to bring about an improvement in conditions. In others, the reason for the unsatisfactory state of affairs will be not so much bad management as lack of essential facilities. To put this right, a local authority can require the necessary work to be done and, where need be, link the notice of works with a direction limiting the number of occupants in a house. In the very worst type of houses conditions may be so bad that, to effect any real improvement, it will be necessary to take action at one and the same time to secure better management, additional facilities and a limitation on the number of occupants. 44 SLUM CLEARANCE Action already taken The following table gives details of the clearance areas declared by the Council since 1950, when slum clearance work under the Housing Acts was recommenced, up to the end of the year:- Name of Area Date of Declaration No. of houses No. of persons displaced Elgin Mews 25.4.1950 28 86 Lionel Mews (Nos.l and 2) 3.10.1950 13 38 Lonsdale Mews (Nos.l and 2) 2.1.1951 19 14 Munro Mews 2.1.1951 24 55 South End Row and Gardens 3.4.1951 10 4 East Mews Road 3.4.1951 14 40 Powis Mews 13.11.1951 13 30 St. Luke1s Mews 13.11.1951 20 41 Portobello Road 13.11.1951 4 3 Kensal New Town (No.l) Area 11.12.1956 34 309 Kensal New Town (No.2) Area 14.1.1958 62 441 Kensal New Town (No.3) Area 14.1.1958 15 146 Portland Road (No.l) Area 11.3.1958 5 31 Portland Road (No.2) Area 11.3.1958 10 71 Kensal New Town (No.4) Area 8.3.1960 7 41 Kensal New Town (No.5) Area 8.3.1960 20 187 Kensal New Town (No.6) Area 8.3.1960 6 62 Railway Mews Area 10.5.1960 10 7 In addition, the London County Council, with the agreement of the Borough Council, have dealt with the Penelon Place/Ashley Cottages/Warwick Road clearance area, containing 66 premises, with an estimated population of 57 families comprising 176 persons. The three Compulsory Purchase Orders made during 1960 in respect of the remainder of the 6½ acres forming Phase 1 of the Kensal New Town Scheme were confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government during the year. Compulsory Purchase Orders Nos.4 and 6 were confirmed without modification, but in respect of Area No.5 the Minister, in confirming the Order, decided that Nos.19 and 23, Hazlewood Crescent shall be retained in the clearance area by reason of bad arrangement only, and that No.15, Hazlewood Crescent shall be excluded from the clearance area and included in land outside the area which the Council were authorised by the Minister to purchase compulsorily. The Clearance Order in respect of Nos.l to 10 (consecutive) Railway Mews, made by the Council on 26th July, 1960, was confirmed, after a public inquiry, by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, subject to the exclusion of No.5, Railway Mews, which was wholly in use as a garage and had lost any identity as housing accommodation. 45 Programme for Slum Clearance The original survey (made under the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954-now repealed) revealed that of 7,416 houses, where the conditions were known to be below standard, 3,293 houses were unfit for habitation. Following that survey, the Council, in conjunction with the London County Council, submitted proposals for dealing with slum clearance areas to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, which were approved. Part of the programme has been dealt with, and taking into account a review which took place in 1959, the following is the current programme now facing the Councils:- Name Premises Estimated population Families Persons Kensington Park Mews Stanley Gardens Mews Lecky Street * Kensal New Town (remainder) Portobello Road/ Telford Road 13 4 5 372 18 9 2 2 692 52 26 5 4 2,364 127 In addition, negotiations have taken place between the Council and the London County Council in regard to the proposal to redevelop an area known as the "Blechynden Street area." The allocation of responsibility between the two authorities has been agreed as follows To be developed by the London County Council: Blechynden Street area north west of Gross area in acres 8.30 To be developed by the Council: Blechynden Street area south east of Gross area in acres 11.40 It will be appreciated that by no means all the properties in this area axe suitable for action under "slum clearance" and the extent to which action under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957 can be taken, will depend on the results of a survey of individual properties. *On 27th September, 1961 it was reported that the five houses in Lecky Street (Nos.l-5 inclusive) which were included in the Council's slum clearance programme, had been demolished by the owners. Accordingly, this axea was deleted from the current slum clearance programme. On 13th February, 1962 the Council made a Compulsory Purchase Order in respect of the clearance area Nos.375 to 401 (odd) Portobello Road and Nos.5 to 11 (odd) Telford Road. The Compulsory Purchase Order included the sites Nos.5 to 11 (odd) Lionel Mews, as adjoining land, the acquisition of which is reasonably necessary for the satisfactory development of the area. Kensal New Town Area This area consisting of over 20 acres is scheduled for clearance. The first portion of 6½ acres has now been declared and re-development by the erection of new flats and maisonettes is 46 well in progress. The final stage of this part being undertaken by the Borough Engineer's Department comprises four blocks (Nos.8, 9, 10 and 11) and is planned on the two island sites bounded by Golborne Gardens, Golborne Road, Southam Street and Adair Road. The redevelopment provides for the closing of Appleford Road between these two island sites. Southam House, on the corner of Adair Road and Southam Street, and the Prince Arthur Public House, 10 Golborne Road, are not to be redeveloped. The present houses on the island sites are, in the main, of three storeys with basements, the basements at the rear being at garden or yard level. This causes a difference in site levels between the back and the front of the houses of approximately 7 ft.6 ins., and to deal with this problem the new blocks have been planned with basements which provide areas for tenants' stores and for garages. The accommodation to be provided is as follows:- Block A: Three storeys with main elevation facing Adair Road-one 3-roomed flat and fourteen 4-roomed flats, with eleven basement garages and fifteen basement stores for tenants. Block B: Pour storeys with main elevation facing Adair Road. The block is connected to Southam House, and has twelve 2-roomed flats, with four basement garages and twelve basement stores for tenants. Block C: Three storeys facing Golborne Road. Seven shops and three surgery units for doctors on the ground floor; ten 4-roomed maisonettes on the first and second floors; five basement garages and ten basement stores for tenants, and a store under each of the shops. Block D: Pour storeys facing Southam Street. Twenty-six 2-roomed flats, with six basement garages and eighteen basement stores for tenants. The remaining portion of the Kensal New Town Area, which is zoned for residential development, will be dealt with by the Council and the London County Council on the following basis:- (i) The Council will undertake the redevelopment of 3.1 acres to the north and 1.62 acres to the south of the 6½ acres upon which they are at present engaged. This area, including the present 6½ acres, is bounded by Kensal Road, Golborne Road, Bosworth Road and the railway. (ii) The London County Council will undertake the redevelopment of 7.2 acres to the east of the borough council's present 6½ acres. This area is bounded by Golborne Road, Kensal Road and the railway. The London County Council will also be responsible for the redevelopment of a small area of 0.41 acres between Kensal Road and the canal, to the west of an area in Paddington, of 3.6 acres which the County Council now propose to zone as open space in place of the open space of 3.6 acres originally proposed at the eastern end of the area. The London County Council will be responsible for school extensions and the provision of additional open space north of Kensal Road. 47 The western area of Kensal New Town, which is scheduled for non-residential purposes, will be dealt with by the London County Council as and when convenient. During 1961 the County Council declared two areas in Bosworth Road to be clearance areas under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957. The premises affected by this are Nos.12 to 46 (even) Bosworth Road. The land in these clearance areas, together with certain adjoining land, is zoned in the County development plan for open space purposes. ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING OF COMMON STAIRCASES IN TENEMENT HOUSES AND FLATS Council Byelaws relating to artificial lighting of common staircases in tenement houses and flats came into operation on 11th March, 1958* The principal Byelaw reads as follows:- "The occupier of every tenement house to which these Byelaws apply and the owner of every block of flats shall provide adequate artificial lighting for all common staircases:- (a) from half an hour before sunset until 12 o'clock midnight; (b) for one hour before sunrise during the months of October, November, December, January, February and March; and (c) at other times as and when necessary if adequate means of natural lighting are not provided." During 1961 formal notices were served in 6 cases, requiring compliance with these Byelaws. IMPROVEMENT OR CONVERSION OF EXISTING HOUSES Owners of private dwellings may apply to the Council for assistance towards carrying out works of improvement or conversion. One aim is to encourage owners to provide services and amenities in houses which are sound but which were built to a lower standard than is generally acceptable nowadays. The other is to encourage the provision of additional satisfactory dwellings, either by converting the large outmoded house from one dwelling into a number of flats, or by converting an old building into one or more dwellings. Grants are not intended to help owners meet the cost of ordinary repairs and renewals, nor are they intended to adapt a perfectly adequate dwelling to the needs of a particular family. They are not normally payable for the provision of extra living rooms or bedrooms, or for increasing the size of existing rooms. They are not payable for the improvement of premises used primarily or partly for business premises. Two methods of application are available. The first is to apply for an improvement grant-known as a discretionary grantunder the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1958. The maximum grant payable is one half of the approved expenditure (which must not be less than £100) subject to a maximum allowance of £400. In considering a scheme of improvement or conversion submitted for grant, only one question may properly be asked, namely, whether it will produce a satisfactory modernised dwelling complying with the statutory conditions and the specified requirements. 48 The requirements which the Minister of Housing and Local Government has specified for a dwelling in respect of which an improvement grant may be made are as follows The dwelling must, after improvement or 1. Be in a good state of repair and substantially free from damp; 2. have each room properly lighted and ventilated; 3. have an adequate supply of wholesome water laid on inside the dwelling; 4. be provided with efficient and adequate means of supplying hot water for domestic purposes; 5. have an internal or otherwise readily accessible water closet; 6. have a fixed bath (or shower) preferably in a separate room; 7. be provided with a sink or sinks and with suitable arrangements for the disposal of waste water; 8. have a proper drainage system; 9. be provided in each room with adequate points for gas or electric lighting (where reasonably available); 10. be provided with adequate facilities for heating; 11. have satisfactory facilities for storing, preparing and cooking food; 12. have proper provision for the storage of fuel (where required). Applications for improvement (discretionary) grants received and dealt with during 1961 are summarised as follows Applications received 24 Applications granted 23 Applications refused 1 Total amount of grants approved £8,278. Os. Od. The second method is to apply for standard grants, which were introduced by the House Purchase & Housing Act, 1959, which came into operation on 14th June, 1959. The Act sets up a new system of standard grants to supplement the present system of improvement grants paid at the discretion of the local authority. The distinctive features of the new system are that these grants are payable only in respect of the provision of specified standard amenities and on the expenditure actually incurred for this purpose; and that provided certain conditions are satisfied the owner of the property can claim the grant sis of right. The new system has been designed to produce as simple a procedure as possible and enable owners generally to form a reasonably accurate idea of the assistance they can hope to receive before any expense is incurred. It is designed to deal in the main with relatively straightforward cases in which the improvements involve little or no structural alteration, 49 leaving the present system of discretionary grants to deal with the more elaborate proposals. There are five standard amenities (listed in Section 4(l) as shown below) eligible for standard grant, which is one half of the cost shown to have been incurred in executing the works involved, subject to a maximum payment of £155• The maximum payment is reduced by the amount shown in parenthesis in cases where the particular provision is omitted, as having been already provided:- (a) A fixed bath or shower in a bathroom (£25) (b) A wash-hand basin (£5) (c) A hot water supply (£75) (d) A water closet for the dwelling (£40) (e) Satisfactory facilities for storing food (£10) These amenities must be for the exclusive use of the occupants of the particular dwelling. The dwelling must after improvement be equipped with all five standard amenities; conversely, grant is not payable towards the cost of providing a second water closet or other amenity if there is already one in the house. If a hot water supply is provided it must be connected to a sink as well as to the bath or shower and wash-hand basin (Section 4(5)). The works which may qualify for grant are such works for the improvement of a dwelling as are required to provide it with such of the standard amenities as it lacks and "improvement" bears the meaning given to it by Section 42(2) of the Housing (financial Provisions) Act, 1958. Thus to the direct cost of installing, say, a bath or wash-hand basin there may be added the cost of any necessary structural alterations and consequent redecoration; while in some cases it may be impracticable to do the work without removing and replacing elsewhere an existing facility such as a sink or foodstore. The test to be applied in considering whether expenditure on any particular work is eligible for grant is whether it would in all the circumstances have been reasonably practicable to equip the dwelling with the amenities it lacked without carrying out that work. No application for a standard grant can be entertained if the dwelling concerned was provided after the end of 1944, with one exception. If the dwelling was produced by conversion and the original building was erected before the end of 1944, then provided the conversion was completed not later than the end of 1958, the dwelling will be eligible for standard grant purposes (Section 4(6)). As under the existing discretionary grant system, for grant to be payable the approval of the authority must be obtained before work is begun and the work must be done to their satisfaction (Section 4(1)). During 1961, four applications for standard grants were received in respect of individual premises. Of these, two were refused as the statutory conditions were not complied with. One application approved was in respect of all five amenities, and the grant amounted to £155• The second approved application was for the provision of a bath and wash-basin (£30). 50 OVERCROWDING In view of the shortage of housing accommodation, created by the war, the Council had up to 1958 operated the overcrowding provisions of the Housing Acts under a special scheme. In November, 1958, however, it was decided to deal with all cases of overcrowding on the strict interpretation of the standards laid down in the Housing Act, 1957s distinguishing between "penal" and "non-penal" cases. The number of new cases of overcrowding reported to the Committee during 1961 was 100, giving an equivalent number of persons of 401. The total number of overcrowding cases which were recorded during the year as having been abated was 120, comprising a total of 504½ units. ASSESSMENT OF HOUSING PRIORITIES ON MEDICAL GROUNDS During the year 158 applications for re-housing on medical grounds were examined, and recommendations for the award of additional points were made to the Chief Housing Officer. In each case the precise medical condition and resultant disability were determined (frequently necessitating communication with the family doctor or with the hospital attended). The premises were inspected in detail to ascertain the extent and nature of the existing accommodation; the adequacy of day and sleeping space; the risk of infection; the existence of remediable or irremediable sanitary or structural defects, and the existence of inconveniences, such as stairs, which might be prejudicial to the patient. On this information and that supplied by the Chief Housing Officer, an assessment of points to be awarded on medical grounds was made in 157 cases. PROVISION OF NEW HOUSING ACCOMMODATION The post-war housing schemes completed in Kensington by the Council have provided. 1,698 flats* The total number of properties under Council management at the end of 1961 is summarised in the following tables- Housing properties 1890 Act 18 Cottage Estates 219 1919 Conversions 96 Pre-war Flats 293 Sundry Properties 6l 687 Temporary Bungalows 48 Compulsory Purchase Area/properties 9 1949 Act Conversions 107 Post—war Flats 1.698 1,862 Nos.27/29, Hazlewood Crescent 10 Properties formerly requisitioned (in Family Units) 421 Other Properties Henry Dickens Court Garages 10 Ingelow House Garages 12 25, Basing Street Garages 2 Gadsden Mews Stores and Stables 17 Lonsdale Mews Stores and Stables 17 Treverton Street Garages and Shops 14 72 3,052 51 Other schemes for building new housing accommodation are in various stages of preparation. FACTORIES Section 128 of the Factories Act, 1937, requires the Medical Officer of Health to make an annual report in regard to the Council's functions under the Act. The following tables give the prescribed particulars in the form requested by the Ministry of Health in Circular No.1/62, dated 18th January, 1962.

No instance of infectious disease occurring in premises where home work is carried on was reported during the year. BASEMENT BAKEHOUSES The Factories Act, 1937 (Section 54), requires the Council to inspect in every fifth year all basement bakehouses in the borough for which certificates of suitability have been issued. The certificates continue to operate if the Council are satisfied that the bakehouses are still suitable. The last quinquennial review was made in 1958, and at the present time there are 6 basement bakehouses in use in the borough. They axe as follows:- 151, Earls Court Road 65, Golborne Road 139, Portland Road 178, Fulham Road 79, Golborne Road 46, Walton Street 53 SANITARY ACCOMMODATION, ETC. IN SHOPS The Shops Act, 1950 empowers the Council to enforce in all shops - (a) suitable and sufficient means of ventilation; (b) suitable and sufficient means of maintaining a reasonable temperature; (c) suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation. As from 1st January, 1959, the London County Council transferred to Metropolitan Borough Councils the responsibility for enforcing provisions of the Shops Act, 1950 relating to adequate lighting, suitable and sufficient washing facilities and, where employees take any meals in the shop premises, suitable and sufficient facilities for taking those meals. Under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 the Council may grant a certificate exempting a shop from the provision of suitable and sufficient water closet accommodation or washing facilities if they are satisfied that by reason of restricted accommodation or other special circumstances affecting the shop it is reasonable that such a certificate should be in force, and that suitable and sufficient accommodation or facilities are otherwise conveniently available. The Council have decided that in those shops where members of both sexes are employed, separate sanitary conveniences for each sex should be required if the number of employees exceeds four, but if the number is less than four, one sanitary convenience should be regarded as suitable and sufficient, provided that the door of the convenience is fitted with a proper lock or fastener on the internal side, and an automatic indicator shows on the external side of the door whether the apartment is engaged or vacant. During the year 1961, no exemption certificate under the Shops Act was granted. Similarly, under the Pood hygiene Regulations, exemption may now be granted in food shops in respect of the provision of constant water supply, wash-hand basins with hot and cold water, cupboard or locker accommodation for outdoor clothing and facilities for washing food and equipment, if such provision cannot reasonably be required. During 1961, no exemption certificate was issued under the Pood Hygiene Regulations. REGISTER OF FACTORIES Section 8 of the Factories Act, 1937 requires the Council to keep a list of all factories within the borough with respect to which the duty of enforcing the provisions of the Factories Act is imposed upon them. The following table gives a summary of the factories on the Council's register at the end of the year, indicating the types of business carried on, whether or not mechanical power is used, and where situated - i.e. North or South Kensington:- 54 Factory - business North Kensington South Kensington Mech.

FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS. 1960 These Regulations are the principal instruments for enforcing good food hygiene practice in foodshops. Their title emphasises the changing trend whereby a national policy is developing along the lines of clean food handling to safe food. A brief summary of the main requirements is as follows Requirements affecting food handlers Persons handling food must- (a) keep their hands and clothing clean; (b) cover open cuts and abrasions with a water-proof dressing; (c) refrain from spitting; (d) refrain from smoking or taking snuff when handling food or when in any room where there is open food; (e) not place food so as to involve risk of contamination; (f) not allow unclean or printed wrapping material to come into contact with food; (g) notify the occupier (and owner) if suffering from, or becoming a carrier of, certain infectious conditions. Requirements relating to food premises (a) No room which communicates with a sanitary venience may be used for the handling of food or the cleaning of equipment; (b) notices requesting users to wash their hands must be displayed in every sanitary convenience; (c) a constant, clean and wholesome water supply must be provided; (d) suitable and sufficient wash-basins must be provided, together with a supply of hot and cold water, soap, nailbrush and clean towels; (e) in premises where open food is handled, suitable and sufficient sinks, together with an adequate supply of hot and cold water, soap or suitable detergent, and of clean cloths must be provided, and in addition adequate and suitable cleaning and drying facilities; (f) lighting and ventilation of food rooms must be adequate and satisfactory; (g) walls, floors, windows, ceiling, woodwork, doors and all other parts of structure of every food room, must be kept clean, and in such good order, repair and condition, as to enable them to be effectively cleaned and prevent risk of infestation by rats, mice, and insects. 56 Requirements relating to food stalls Every stall- (a) must bear the name and address of the person carrying on the business; (b) must be kept clean and in good repair; (c) when used for meat and fish, must be covered over and screened at the sides and back, and a covered metal refuse bin must be provided for all waste trimmings; (d) when used for open food, for immediate consumption, must be provided with suitable and sufficient sinks for washing food and equipment, together with a supply of hot and cold water, soap, nailbrush, clean towels and drying cloths. Requirements relating to the Transport and Carrying of Meat Vehicles carrying "open" meat must enclose completely the part in which meat is carried; have an impervious floor or movable duckboards; be kept clean and in good order; have suitable impervious clean receptacles to contain offal separately, except where no meat other than offal is being carried. Persons carrying "open" meat must wear a clean washable overall and head covering. Generally Suitable and sufficient bandages, dressings and antiseptic must be provided and maintained in food premises. Sufficient and suitable cupboard or locker accommodation for clothing and footwear must be provided for persons engaged in or about food premises. In premises where the business consists wholly or partly of the supply of food for immediate consumption, food consisting of meat, fish, gravy or imitation cream, or prepared from or containing these substances, or any egg or milk, must be kept at a temperature above 145°P or below 50°F. Food in or about any forecourt, yard, market or stall must not be placed lower than 18 inches from the ground. A person guilty of an offence against any of these Regulations shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both, and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £5 for each day during which the offence continues after conviction. During the year, the public health inspectors have been engaged on surveying food premises in the borough and a total of 2,134 inspections was made. In 115 cases it was necessary to send informal notices pointing out deficiencies under the Regulations and, generally speaking, the food traders are complying with the requirements in a co-operative manner. It was, however, found necessary to take legal proceedings for contraventions of the Regulations, as follows:- 57 DETAILS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TAKEN UNDER FOOD HYGIENE REGULATIONS IN 1961 As requested by Ministry of Health Circular 22/58.

The following is a record of the inspections made by the public health inspections engaged on this work for 1961:- Premises registered under - No. of Premises No. of Inspections (l) Section 16, Pood and Drugs Act. 1955(a) for the sale, or the manufacture for the purpose of sale, of ice-cream, or the storage of ice-cream intended for sale 377 154* (b) for the preparation or manufacture of sausages or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved food intended for sale 138 170 (2) Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 as dairies or where the occupier is registered for the sale of milk in sealed containers only 201 175 * Additional inspections of the premises (not primarily in connection with the sale of ice-cream) are recorded under different headings in the following table. 59 Food premises (all categories) No. of Premises No. of Inspections Bakehouses-underground 6 7 Bakehouses-others 7 6 Bread and cake shops 45 32 Butchers 61 144 Dairies and premises where milk is sold 201 175 Fishmongers 29 38 Food Factories 16 13 General Stores 60 109 Greengrocers 81 41 Grocers 217 470 Ice-cream 377 154 Preserved food 30 26 Public houses and off-licences 193 44 Restaurants and cafes 330 362 Sweet shops 154 59 Street markets, stalls and storage premises 95 352 (licensed traders) (102 miscellaneous visits) Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. 1960 These Regulations, which came into operation on 1st October, 1960, consolidated and re-enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation)(Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949-1954, and the Milk (Special Designation)(Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949-1953. The principal changes were:- 1. All dealers' licences, other than those issued by the Minister, will be issued by the food and drugs authority for the area in which are situated the premises at or from which the milk is sold. A dealer's licence no longer restricts sales to the area of the licensing authority and supplementary licences are therefore discontinued. 2. A new form of licence, the dealer's (pre-packed milk) licence, is introduced which may authorise, in a single form of licence, the use of any or all of the appropriate special designations where the milk is obtained by the licensed dealer pre-packed, i.e. in the container in which it is to be delivered to the consumer, or is pasteurised or sterilised by the dealer in accordance with a dealer's (pasteuriser's) licence or a dealer's (steriliser's) licence. The dealer's (tuberculin tested) licence is being retained. 3. Dealers' licences issued on or after 1st January, 1961, will be valid for five years from that date, and will be renewable for subsequent quinquennial periods. 4. The half-hour methylene blue test is prescribed for tuberculin tested milk if the licence in respect of which the sample is taken is a dealer's licence, and the clot-on-boiling test if the licence is a producer's licence. The latter test will therefore be applied only to samples taken by the Ministry. The four-and-a-half hour methylene blue test is no longer prescribed. The methylene blue test for tuberculin tested milk and pasteurised milk has been modified and a new phosphatase test for pasteurised milk has been prescribed. 5. The sealing of wholesale containers of tuberculin tested milk despatched to dealers is no longer obligatory. The sealing of retail containers (other than bottles) continues to be required. 60 6. Tuberculin tested milk may be placed in a fixed tank at or near a farm for subsequent bulk collection, but the milk must be pasteurised or sterilised before sale. 7. A licence-holder is no longer obliged to allow samples of milk to be taken free of charge. 8. An inspector breaking the seal of a container in order to take a sample must re-seal the container and attach a label stating that he has opened and re-sealed it. These changes in licensing procedure are designed primarily to reduce the amount of routine work involved in the administration of the Regulations. There are no milk processing depots in the borough and all the licences granted were in relation to milk obtained in pre-packed form for sale from premises within the borough. The number of applications granted during the year was 197, authorising the use of the special designations as:- Tuberculin Tested milk 166 Pasteurised milk 187 Sterilised milk 162 The following table shows the number of samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) milk and processed milks taken during the year, together with the results of examinations:- Designation No. of Samples Methylene blue test Phosphatase test Turbidity test Passed Failed Passed Failed Passed Failed Tuberculin Tested (Farm bottled) 22 *18 - - - - - Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 8 8 - 8 - - - Pasteurised 21 *19 - 21 - - - Sterilised — — - — — — — *Two samples of Pasteurised milk and k samples of Tuberculin Tested (Farm bottled) milk were not submitted to the methylene blue test as the atmospheric shade temperature exceeded 70°F., which is the limit specified in the regulations. Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations. 1969 (a) Registrations The number of persons registered under these Regulations at the end of the year, to sell milk from premises in the borough (including the sale of cream in sealed containers) was 201. (b) Unclean Milk Containers It is an offence under the Regulations for any dairy farmer or distributor to use for holding milk any vessel that is not in a state of thorough cleanliness immediately before use. In the case of 61 bottled milk, the time "immediately before use" is considered to mean at the time the bottle is first filled and, therefore, any offence would be committed at the time and place of bottling. During the year three contraventions were reported. Two cases related to bottles of milk delivered to different parts of the borough by the same distributors. In the first instance the Public Health Committee authorised that a warning be given to the distributors, and in the second instance details of the offence were reported to the local authority in whose area the bottling plant is situated. In the remaining case, investigations failed to reveal sufficient evidence to justify any action. Composition of Milk During the year 323 samples of milk (all grades) were submitted to the Public Analyst. Pour were found to be below the legal and presumptive standards laid down. In one case proceedings were instituted, warfiings were given in two cases and the results sent to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, and in the remaining case it was decided to take no further action. The following table shows the percentages of milk-fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples of milk, other than Channel Islands and South Devon milk, taken during each month. It should be mentioned that, included in these, are 29 samples certified by the Publio Analyst to be genuine, although the percentage of solids-notfat wag slightly below the presumptive standard of 8.5%.

These Regulations require that all milk for human consumption sold under the specific description of- Channel Islands Milk Jersey Milk Guernsey Milk or South Devon Milk must contain not less than 4% by weight of milk fat. This compares with the presumptive milk fat standard of 3% specified for ordinary milk by the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1939. 62 During the year, 110 samples of these milks were taken and 3 were found to be below the legal standard laid down. The action taken in respect of these unsatisfactory samples had already been referred to in this report. The following table shows the average percentages of milk fat and non-fat solids of the genuine samples taken during each month - Month No. of samples taken Average percentages Milk Fats Non-fat solids January 9 4.26 8.94 February 8 4.26 8.71 March 5 4.28 8.82 April 14 4.16 8.86 May 8 4.15 9.15 June 10 4.13 8.98 July 7 4.26 8.97 August 9 4.35 8.93 September 5 4.36 8.93 October 4 4.55 9.06 November 15 4.46 9.10 December 13 4.54 8.99 Average for the whole year 4.31 8.95 Legal minimum standard 4.00 8.50 Unsound. Food Seizure Under Part 1 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955» it is an offence to sell, offer, or expose for sale, or to be in possession for the purpose of sale or preparation for sale, food intended for human consumption which is in an unfit condition. Such food can be seized and taken before a Justice of the Peace who can condemn it, and order it to be destroyed or disposed of for purposes other than human consumption. During the year there was no occasion when it was found necessary to enforce this procedure. Surrender Any person having in his possession food which is diseased, unsound, or unfit for human consumption can, under Section 180(8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, surrender it to the Council for destruction or other suitable method of disposal. During the year the following amounts of food were surrendered and condemned as unfit for human consumption:- 63 - Food Tons Cwt Qtrs Lb Meat (raw) 1 19 1 3 Ham and Pork (tinned) 2 5 - 17 Other meat (tinned) 2 3 15 Dried Fruit 3 13 Sauerkraut 6 2 1 Australian apples 1 11 2 - Sweets 2 3 22 Cucumbers in brine 1 2 2 26 Fish (wet and dry) 7 17 6 Sausage 9 1 27 Fats and cheese 3 5 Preserves 15 2 3 Gherkins 5 3 20 TOTAL: 9 14 3 18 Tins, jars, packets or cartons of fruit, vegetables and miscellaneous foodstuffs 14,051 All food condemned as unfit for human consumption is collected by the Council, taken to their refuse destructor in Wood Lane and destroyed. In no instance were large quantities of food involved, necessitating special examination of stocks of food. Complaints by purchasers of unfit food During the year 18 complaints were received from members of the public, alleging the unsatisfactory condition of food purchased by them in the borough. The complaints generally related to the presence of foreign matter in foods, and the unsatisfactory condition of bread, ham, cider, frozen steaklets and Turkish Delight. In one case legal proceedings were taken against the manufacturers of a loaf of bread, which contained dirt. At the Court hearing (March, 1962 ) the firm pleaded guilty and were fined £5-0s.0d., and £2. 2s. Od. costs were awarded to the Council. In a further seven cases, the Public Health Committee decided to send warning letters to the vendors or manufacturers concerned. The remaining ten cases were dealt with informally, either owing to the lack of sufficient evidence, or to the complaint not being substantiated. Adulteration of Food During the year, 563 formal samples of food and drugs were purchased, of which 24(4.3%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. 437 informal samples were also purchased, of which 24(5.5%) were either adulterated or otherwise unsatisfactory. The following table summarises the action taken in respect of defective samples:- - 64 - Unsatisfactory sample No. of Prosecutions No. of warnings to Producers , Manufacturers or Vendors No further action Total Milk 1 2 1 4 Pork Sausages - 5 1 6 Butter - 1 - 1 Minced Beef 1 3 - 4 Minced Steak 2 - - 2 Herring Tidbits in wine sauce - 2 - 2 Beef Sausages - 1 - 1 Orange drink - - 1 1 Dried Apricots - 1 - 1 Lemon Crush - - 1 1 Ginger punch - - 1 1 Shredded beef suet - - 1 1 Cochineal colouring - 3 1 4 Sterilised cream - - 1 1 Vienna Sausages - 2 - 2 Sweet Pickle - 1 - 1 Ground Nutmeg - 6 - 6 Chocolate milk - 1 - 1 Chocolate Blancmange Powder - - 1 1 Washed currants - 1 - 1 Dressed Crab - 1 - 1 Fillets of Herring - 1 - 1 'Kep' sauce - - 1 1 Chop sauce - - 1 1 Cider - 1 - 1 Aspic Jelly Powder — — 1 1 TOTALS: 4 32 12* 48 * In all cases the results of these unsatisfactory samples were brought to the notice of the producers, manufacturers, or vendors as the case may be. Ice Cream The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959, and the Labelling of Pood (Amendment) Regulations, 1959, have been made jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. They came into operation on 27th April, 1959, and repealed the previous Order of 1953. The ice cream regulations prescribe amended standards for ice cream and introduce separate standards for "dairy ice cream" (or "dairy cream ice "or "cream ice"), and for "milk ice". The legal Standards of Composition for ice cream are as follows:- (a) Ice cream shall contain not less than 5 Per cent, fat and 7½ per cent, milk solids other than fat, so however, that where ice cream contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either conform to the above standard or, alternatively, the total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½ - 65 - per cent, of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cent. fat and 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat: Provided that as respects any ice cream sold, or offered or exposed for sale under any of the descriptions hereinafter specified, or under any such other description as is calculated to lead an intending purchaser to believe that he is purchasing ice cream of any such description as is so specified, the standard of composition shall be as fOllows:- (i) Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice shall in each case contain not less than 5 per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than per cent. milk solids other than fat, so, however, that where any Dairy Ice Cream, Dairy Cream Ice or Cream Ice contains any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree it shall either conform to the standard of composition for that ice cream, or alternatively, the total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall be not less than 12½ per cent. of the whole including the fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, as the case may be, and such total content of milk fat and milk solids other than fat shall include not less than 7½ per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 2 per cent. milk solids other than fat. (ii) Milk Ice, or Milk Ice containing any fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree, shall contain not less than 2½ per cent. milk fat and no other fat (save as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, any flavouring substance or any emulsifying or stabilising agent) and not less than 7 per cent. milk solids other than fat. (iii) "Parev" (kosher) ice shall contain not less than 10 per cent. fat and no milk fat or other derivative of milk. (b) No ice cream of any description shall contain any artificial sweetener. The previous requirement that ice cream shall contain not less them 10 per cent. of sugar has been revoked. The Labelling Regulations prohibit the labelling, marking or advertising of ice cream in a manner suggestive of butter, cream, milk, or anything connected with the dairy interest unless the ice cream contains no fat other than milk fat (except such as may be introduced by the use as an ingredient of any egg, flavouring substance, or emulsifying or stabilising agent), but permit the presence of skimmed milk solids to be declared. These regulations also provide that, after 30th November, 1959, it will be an offence to sell under the description "ice cream", any pre-packed ice cream which contains fat other than milk fat unless it bears on the wrapper or container a declaration "Contains non-milk fat", or, if appropriate, "Contains vegetable fat", in type of a prescribed minimum size. - 66 - The following table shows the number of samples (19 ice cream, 8 dairy ice cream and. one chocolate-coated, ice cream) taken during 1961 for chemical analysis compared with those taken in the previous year:- 1960 1961 Number of samples 18 28 Variation of fat content per cent 8.3 to 12.3 8.6 to 20.3 Variation of non-fat content per cent 22.5 to 32.3 25.0 to 35.2 Average fat content per cent 10.51 11.10 Average non-fat solids content per cent 26.56 27.70 The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959, came into operation on 27th April, 1959, and. revoked the Regulations of 1947 to 1952. They require that ingredients used in the manufacture of ice cream are to be pasteurised by one or other of three specified, methods, viz:- Method I The mixture shall be raised, to and kept at a temperature of not less than 160°F. for at least 30 minutes. Method II The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than l60°P. for at least 10 minutes. Method III The mixture shall be raised to and kept at a temperature of not less than 170°F. for at least 15 seconds. An alternative method is by sterilisation by raising the mixture to a temperature of not less than 300°P. for at least 2 seconds. After pasteurisation or sterilisation the mixture has to be reduced to a temperature of not more than 45°F. within 1½ hours and kept at this temperature until frozen, after which it must be kept at a temperature not exceeding 28°P. up to the time of being sold. There is still no legal bacteriological standard for ice cream. As in previous years, samples were taken and submitted for examination under the provisional methylene blue reduction test, which is a simple and practical means for the routine examination of ice cream. The test is not of sufficient precision to justify its use as a statutory test. The grading is determined by the length of time taken to decolourize the methylene blue and it is suggested that if samples consistently fail to reach grades 1 and 2 it would be reasonable to regard this as an indication of defects in manufacture or handling which warrant further investigation. During the year 21 samples of ice cream were also taken and submitted to the methylene blue test. The results are as follows:- - 67 - Grade No. of samples 1 9 2 2 3 4 4 6 Premises in the borough where ice cream is manufactured, stored or sold were frequently inspected during the year and generally were found to be in a satisfactory condition, having regard to the Ice Cream (Heat Treatment etc.,) Regulations, 1959• Condensed Milk The Condensed Milk Regulations, 1959, made jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, and the Minister of Health, came into operation on 26th June, 1959. They substantially re-enact in a consolidated and revised form the Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations, 1923/1953. Certain new provisions have been introduced, the principal ones being:- (a) to provide for the sale of condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk labelled "should not be used for babies except under medical advice" (b) to define half cream milk as meaning milk which contains not less than 10.8% of milk solids including not less than 1.8% of milk fat (c) to prescribe minimum percentages of milk fat and milk solids including fat for condensed partly skimmed (half cream) milk. During the year 11 samples of condensed milk were submitted for analysis and found to comply with the requirements. General There are no abattoirs or slaughterhouses in the borough, and no killing of animals for human consumption is carried out. Pesticide Residues in Food Dr. Amphlett Williams, the Council's Public Analyst, prepared a comprehensive and detailed memorandum, calling attention to the danger to public health from the possible occurrences in food-stuffs of residual traces of insecticides, fungicides, and other agricultural chemicals. This memorandum was considered by the Public Health Committee in April, 1961, who decided to send it to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee with a request that they should make representations to the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, fcr consideration to be given to this question. The following is a brief summary of the memorandum:- "The problem arises from the continuing production and use of an immense variety of new and highly complex pesticides, and affects the following three fundamental aspects of food administration. - 68 - Sampling. Until quite recently a non-volatile insecticidal spray applied to fruit could be relied upon to leave a visible residue when it dried. Many of the newer insecticides, however, might leave little or no residue when applied to fruit or vegetables, and this makes the job of the sampling officer, whether at the port or in the market, extremely difficult. Analysis. Small, but possibly toxic, proportions of many of the new pesticides would escape detection in fruit and vegetable products in a general analysis of the kind hitherto carried out for the purposes of the Pood and Drugs Act. Although methods for the analysis of residues of some of the new pesticides have been worked out, these are complex and present a number of technical difficulties, partly because of the many insecticides now used. Enforcement. Although the toxicity of some of the new organic pesticides would appear to be as high as that of the most poisonous of the older inorganic insecticides, no safe limits for their residues in food have been laid down, nor even suggested, by either of the Ministries concerned, for the use of local authorities. In the absence of official limits it would be difficult to establish in a Court of Law that a residual trace of an insecticide was injurious to health. Even if a sampling officer happened to procure a sample of contaminated produce, and the analyst to detect the contaminant, the local authority might still be in no position to assess the danger, if any, nor to take suitable action. Dr. Amphlett Williams states that consideration of these problems leads inevitably to the conclusion that they can be solved only by some measure of Government control of the use of potentially toxic pesticides. The following three measures are suggested which, taken together, would seem to offer a possible solution:- (i) Restriction of Choice of Pesticide. A policy of reducing the number of potentially toxic residues by limiting the choice of remedies for any particular crop to, say, two or three products which have been recommended by an independent authority. (ii) Addition of Tracers. A policy of requiring by Government order the incorporation of an easily detectable substance with any toxic pesticide before sale to a user. The use of such "tracers" would greatly assist analysis. (iii) Advisory Service. Where no legal standards have been laid down, local authorities should be kept advised by the Central Government on which pesticides are permitted (if the number is to be restricted); which "tracers" are to be specified for each permitted pesticide; and the maximum safe limits, based solely upon public health considerations, for all permitted pesticides in food. A weakness of any system for controlling the use of pesticides in this country would lie in its inability to cover imported produce but, if the system suggested above could be successfully applied in this country, the public would be able to rely upon home-grown produce. Moreover, such a satisfactorily operating system would doubtless - 69 - receive careful consideration by the Pood and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations, and its adoption by the major chemical manufacturing countries should extend the cover to the more agrarian countries, and enable Port Health authorities to insist on its application to all imported produce." The Standing Joint Committee stated that they consider it extremely important that there should be a research project continually examining the implications of the use of these chemicals and that, in the meantime, there should be issued a list of the approved substances indicating - (i) those which can be easily identified; (ii) those which are more difficult to detect, and (iii) those where detection may be impossible; and indicating against each whether or not it is considered to be potentially toxic. The Standing Joint Committee made representations on these lines to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Pood. A detailed reply from the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Pood gave information about an agreement with manufacturers under which no new chemical is introduced for use in agriculture unless the appropriate Government Advisory Committee are able to make recommendations for its safe use. The Ministry also stated that a Research Study Group was examining the question of the use of toxic chemicals in agriculture and food storage, including pesticide residues, and that a Report was expected shortly. This Report has now been published and the Committee received from the Medical Officer of Health a comprehensive and detailed report upon it. After carefully considering this report the Committee were not satisfied that the proposals of the Research Study Group will effectively deal with the problem. The Research Study Group make no reference to the first suggestion of the public analyst and reject the other two suggestions. The present position may be summarised as follows:- A large and ever increasing number of new and highly poisonous pesticides are being used on fruit, vegetables and grain. Some of these have caused widespread deaths among birds, insects and wild animals. Some are known to be dangerous in very small amounts to human beings. Their use is controlled by a voluntary scheme whereby manufacturers are expected to notify the Ministry of dangerous new products, and partly by regulations to protect farm workers which are not binding on farmers who do the spraying themselves. These regulations are enforced by a safety and wages inspectorate of seventytwo for England and Wales. These arrangements are obviously inapplicable abroad. It is claimed that no evidence of harm to consumers has been adduced, yet there is already some contradictory information on shortterm effects. Research to gain further knowledge in twenty-four aspects of these pesticides has been advocated. The public analyst advises that with no indication of what may have been used, it is impossible in practice and in the short time available to identify many of these pesticides. Further, it is impossible in the present state of knowledge to say what are safe maximum levels, and in these circumstances local authorities are in no position to assess danger, if any, nor to take suitable action. - 70 - The Committee were not satisfied that the Council possessed adequate legal powers and adequate sources of information to enable them to discharge their duties as a food and drugs authority, and gave instructions for the Medical Officer's report to be sent to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee with a request that further consideration should be given to the original three proposals made by the public analyst. FOOD POISONING The Food and Drugs Act, 1955, requires any medical practitioner, on becoming aware that a person is suffering or is suspected to be suffering from food poisoning, to notify the Medical Officer of Health. The following table gives a summary of all cases (notified or not) brought to notice during 1961:- Food poisoning notifications (corrected) First quarter 8 Second quarter 7 Third quarter 20 Fourth quarter 7 TOTAL: 42 Cases otherwise ascertained 6 Fatal cases; Nil.

They had eaten fried sole, mayonnaise sauce, salad and a variety of other dishes. Enquiries revealed that twenty-two other persons had been affected and most of the complainants had eaten mayonnaise sauce and salad. No food poisoning pathogens were recovered directly from the cases, and extensive bacteriological investigations of suspected foods failed to demonstrate the causative agent, although staph, aureus was isolated from samples of various types of food (all from later stocks). Staph. aureus were isolated from hand swabs of three kitchen workers and from swabs of four chopping blocks. Phage typing proved that a variety of strains was involved, and in only one case - one of the hand swabs - did the strain belong to the group usually associated with food poisoning. For the purpose of record, it was considered that this outbreak was due to Staphylococcal food poisoning. Single cases Thirty-nine isolated cases of food poisoning were notified. No causative agent was identified in twenty-six of these cases. The identified agents which caused the other thirteen cases were: Salmonella typhimurium 11 ,, seftenberg 1 ,, St. Paul 1 Salmonella notifications - not food borne One case was reported of a Salmonella infection in a woman, aged 52, who had apparently been subjected to a "cross-infection" whilst on holiday in Prance. INFECTIOUS DISEASE Smallpox No case of smallpox was notified in the borough during 1961. The Ministry of Health's Memorandum on Vaccination against smallpox recommends that public health officers, likely to have to deal with cases of smallpox at short notice, should be regularly revaccinated at not more than yearly intervals. During the year 20 members of the staff of the public health department were vaccinated or re-vaccinated by the Medical Officer of Health. Scarlet Fever The number of cases notified in l96l was 30, but only two were treated in hospital. There was no fatal case during the year; in fact, there has been no death from scarlet fever in Kensington since 1940. Diphtheria During the year there was an outbreak of diphtheria at the London County Council Occupation Centre at Wallingford Avenue, W.10, and 14 persons were known to have been infected. Three of the cases, unfortunately, proved fatal. - 72 - The matter first came to my notice on Tuesday, 7th February, when the Medical Officer of Health of Islington advised me that a child attending the Centre, but resident in his borough, had been admitted to hospital and was clinically a severe case of diphtheria. On receipt of this information, immediate enquiries were commenced at the Centre, and the Divisional Medical Officer of the London County Council was informed. Steps were immediately taken to protect all the children in the Centre by giving Antitoxin to the un-immunised and "boosting doses" to those with a history of immunisation. An extensive programme of swabbing was undertaken, not only in the Centre, but in the families of children in the Centre and in the school classes attended by other members of their families. The position was complicated by the fact that the children involved lived in five boroughs; Hammersmith, St. Pancras, Paddington, Islington and Westminster. Further, one of the cases, residing in Kensington, had attended a children's party in Westminster, attended by 60 children from 15 local authorities' districts. The situation was further involved by the fact that the pupils attending a neighbouring Occupation Centre shared the same school bus. Only one of the children attending the Centre who lived in Kensington was a clinical case of diphtheria, and was in fact discovered by the staff of the Public Health Department. Details of the outbreak were sent to the Ministry of Health, and to Medical Officers of Health of other local authorities concerned. All contacts and children living outside Kensington who had directly or indirectly been exposed to infection, were referred to the appropriate Medical Officers of Health for surveillance. On 8th February, a circular letter was sent to 350 doctors practising in Kensington, advising them of the outbreak, indicating the localities where the children lived and urging the importance of bearing in mind the possibility of diphtheria in all cases of sore throat, nasal infection or other similar symptoms. On 10th February, a further letter was sent to all local practitioners advising them of the position then obtaining in the outbreak and indicating where supplies of immunising material could be obtained; which London County Council immunisation centres were available and the scheme of immunisation which was officially recommended for children of various ages. With the authority of the Chairman of the Public Health Committee, a Press Statement was issued, drawing attention to the outbreak and urging parents to ensure that their children were adequately immunised either by the family doctor or at one of the London County Council immunisation clinics. Enteric Fever During the year there were 3 cases of typhoid fever. The first case concerned a 29-year old male who occupied a single room letting. He was treated for typhoid fever at Guy's Hospital, ten weeks after having arrived in this country from Australia. Faeces, urine and blood specimens taken by the hospital were persistently negative for organisms. In view of the patient's history, enlarged spleen and positive widal, the patient was considered to have suffered from typhoid fever modified by previous T.A.B. inoculation. Specimens submitted by contacts proved negative. The second case involved a man aged 39 who was admitted to hospital suffering from vomiting, exhaustion and loss of weight. He had just returned from Rome and Sardinia, where he had experienced the same symptoms. Upon arrival in this country his condition deteriorated - 73 - and. he was removed to hospital. All contacts remained well and. submitted negative specimens. The patient recovered, in hospital. The third case was a child aged 11 months, who arrived in this country during September from Damascus. The child was admitted to hospital during the second week of December and it was suspected that the child had contracted typhoid from one of its parents. Enquiries showed that the family had been regularly inoculated for the past five years. Specimens were submitted by all contacts and the mother and an elder child (aged nearly 2 years) were confirmed as "carriers" and admitted to hospital for treatment. All other specimens were negative. The mother and both children were discharged from hospital, although the mother was still submitting positive specimens. She is undergoing a course of treatment prescribed by her own doctor. Puerperal Pyrexia During 1961 the number of cases of this disease notified was 168 of whom 116 were persons normally resident outside Kensington. All but two of these cases occurred in hospital. In order to show some perspective in reviewing the incidence of puerperal pyrexia (defined as any febrile condition occurring in a woman in whom a temperature of 100.4°F. or more has occurred within fourteen days after childbirth or miscarriage), the following table gives an analysis of the causes of pyrexia in the notified cases:- Cause No. of cases. Breast infections 8 Respiratory infections:- Upper 3 Lower 11 Urinary infection. 33 Pyrexia associated with abnormal delivery:- (a) A.R.M. or Forceps 3 (b) Caesarian section 3 6 Genital tract infections 12 Parotitis 2 Allergic reaction 1 Causes unknown after investigation 92 Total 168 In addition to the above, information was received concerning 36 patients normally resident in Kensington, who were notified as suffering from puerperal pyrexia in other London districts. No death occurred under this heading. Pneumonia There are various forms of pneumonia, but the only types notifiable are (i) acute primary and (ii) acute influenzal pneumonia. During the year 28 notifications were received, 12 being acute primary pneumonia and 16 being acute influenzal pneumonia. Of the total, 4 cases were removed to hospital for treatment. The number of deaths from pneumonia (all forms) was 111, and the number of deaths from influenza was 11 during 1961. Dysentery Ninety-seven cases of dysentery were notified during 1961, all of which were bacillary in origin, the majority being due to the Sonne bacillus. Generally speaking, the cases were of a mild type - 74 - and. there were no deaths. Twenty-eight of these patients were treated in hospital. Erysipelas Five cases were notified during the year; four were treated at home, and one was admitted to hospital. There were no deaths. Meningococcal Infection Two cases of this disease were notified during the year and were removed to hospital. The death of a child aged one year was reported. Malaria One case of malaria was reported during the year, but investigations showed that the patient had recently arrived from abroad, and presumably had contracted infection overseas. Poliomyelitis Seven cases of acute poliomyelitis were notified and confirmed during the year; six of the cases showed symptoms of paralysis. There was no death from this disease during the year. The figures in the last seven years are as follows:- Year Confirmed cases Deaths 1955 30 Nil 1956 21 Nil 1957 15 1 1958 4 Nil 1959 8 Nil 1960 3 Nil 1961 7 Nil There were four suspected cases removed to hospital, where the diagnosis was not confirmed. Contacts of all cases were kept under surveillance for twenty-one days (or until the diagnosis was changed in unconfirmed cases). Kensington residents, who were contacts of cases occurring outside the borough, were also kept under observation. Evidence that vaccination against poliomyelitis is effective increases every year and a recent report by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee states that "inactivated vaccines have proved to be safe and effective." It is probably true to say that vaccination is slowly and steadily reducing the number of cases all over the world. However, there is no cause for complacency and every effort must be taken to see that the level of protected persons in the borough is raised as high as possible. Acute Encephalitis No case of acute encephalitis was notified during the year. Measles In my Annual Report for 1960, attention was drawn to the biennial periodicity of measles. In 1959 seven hundred and thirtyseven cases were notified and in 1960 four hundred and fifty-seven - 75 - cases were notified. As predicted in my 1960 Report, the 1960/61 measles incidence constituted an "epiphenomenal" epidemic. Reaching approximately 1,800, it was over 500 in excess of the highest epidemic number since notification commenced. Of the 1,497 cases notified during 1961, 20 were admitted to hospital for treatment. One death occurred under this heading. The following table shows the number of cases, in age groups, which occurred during the year:- M. F. Under 1 year 28 35 1 year 107 99 2 years 120 105 3 ,, 121 111 4 ,, 111 103 5-9 years 203 248 10 - 14 20 16 15 - 24 ,, 11 19 25 and over 9 14 Age unknown 9 8 Total (all ages): 739 758 Ophthalmia Neonatorum Five cases were notified during 1961, and all were treated in hospital. All patients fully recovered with no impairment of vision. Gastro-enteritis This disease is notifiable in children up to the age of five years. Fourteen cases were reported during the year and three were removed to hospital for treatment. Scabies The number of scabies notified during 1961 was 25, which compares with 463 notified in the peak year of 1946. Tuberculosis During the year 195 new cases of tuberculosis were notified, of which 168 were respiratory and 27 non-respiratory. The following table shows the number of cases added to said the number removed from the notification register during the year:- Description Respiratory NonRespiratory Total M F M F On register of notifications on 1st January, 1961 790 6 58 6 9 98 1,615 Notified for the first time during the year 102 66 14 13 195 Brought to notice other than by notification 117 77 13 13 220 Removed from register on account of having - (a) recovered 48 60 6 10 124 (b) removed from district, lost sight of, etc. 214 176 12 11 413 (c) died 10 1 3 1 15 Remaining on register on 31st December, 1961 737 564 75 102 1,478 - 76 - The system of investigation into the environmental conditions of tuberculosis patients continued during the year. All newly notified cases and those cases transferring into Kensington or changing their address in the borough, have been visited by the public health inspectors with the object of tracing the source of infection, preventing the spread of infection and removing conditions favourable to infection. Particular attention was given to the home conditions in addition to the dissemination of advice to prevent the transmission of infection to contacts. During the year, 314 visits were paid to the homes of tuberculous patients. In 170 of these, the environmental conditions were such as to require no further action on the part of the Public Health Department; in a further 31 cases, it was found that the patients had moved away; and in 82 other cases the investigations were postponed as the patients were away in hospital or had not been contacted by the end of the year. The action taken in the remaining 31 cases is summarised as follows:- Action or supervision Cases Investigation or supervision undertaken in respect ofs- (a) re-arrangement of existing accommodation 3 (b) occupation of patients 2 (c) tracing of contacts 2 (d) prevention of spread of infection 10 Recommended for priority rehousing 3 Action taken under Public Health and Housing Acts in respect of insanitary or unhealthy conditions 11 Incidence of tuberculosis amongst Kensington residents who originated from areas outside England. Scotland and Vales In my Annual Report for 1951, attention was drawn to what appeared to be a disturbing trend in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst immigrants. Since 1952, a more detailed investigation of this problem has taken place and the following table sets out the information found in 1961- Country of origin Period (in years) between entry to United Kingdom and notification of disease Total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Portugal - - - - 1 - - - - - 1 India 2 - 1 3 Cyprus 2 - - - - - - - - - Germany 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 Kenya - - - 1 - — — — — — 1 Italy 2 — 2 Spain 3 - - - - - — — — 1 4 Ireland 3 2 1 - l - - 2 1 1 11 Czechoslovakia - - - - - 2 - - - - 2 Gibraltar - 1 - - - - - - - - 1 Brit.

The total of 253 cases surveyed differs from the total of tuberculous patients visited in the year. The difference consisted of old cases changing residence within the borough. In 1951, a full survey was not made, but it was estimated that 20 per cent. of the tuberculous patients visited for the first time in that year were immigrants who contracted the disease within ten years of arrival in this country. A more accurate investigation in the following years indicated that, of the new cases and "inward transfers" reported in the borough, the proportions who were immigrants contracting the disease in the first ten years of arrival, were as follows:- Year Proportion per cent. 1952 16 1953 10 1954 16 1955 17 1956 15 1957 16 1958 23 1959 20 1960 20 1961 11 This year, 55 per cent. (1960-39 per cent.) of the infected immigrants contracted the disease within one year of arrival in this country; 69 per cent. (1960-73 per cent.) contracted it within three years of arrival. Persons born in the Republic of Ireland were regarded as immigrants for this purpose. The 1951 Census figures showed that out of a total Kensington population of 168,160, there were 29,353 residents (or just over 17 per cent.) who were born outside the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Whooping Cough Thirty cases were notified during the year. No deaths were reported during 1961. - 78 - International Certificates In order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, certain countries require that visitors should be vaccinated or inoculated against specified diseases. International certificates have been prescribed for smallpox, yellow fever and cholera. When completed by the medical practitioner, the certificates must be authenticated by the Medical Officer of Health. During the year, 3,576 of these certificates were authenticated in Kensington. In addition, 47 special exemption certificates were issued to travellers for use in the United States of America. Notifications The following tables show (l) the number of cases of infectious disease notified during the year 1961, with comparative figures for the previous seven years; (2) the number of notifications divided into age groups; and (3) the number of cases notified in each ward of the borough.
