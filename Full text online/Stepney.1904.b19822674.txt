STE 6 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Medical Officer of Health and Public Analyst FOR THE Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. 1904. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST, FOR THE YEAR 1904. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney. Gentlemen, I have great pleasure in submitting to you my fourth Annual Report, which deals with the Vital and Sanitary Statistics of the Borough of Stepney for 1904. Population. The population estimated to the middle of the year was 303,791, distributed as follows:— Limehouse District 58,176 St. George's „ 50,526 Mile End „ 114,957 Whitechapel „ 80,132 4 Births. The total number of births registered during the year was 11,159, which consisted of 5,673 males and 5,486 females. 1,905 births were registered in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 32.7 per 1,000 of the population. 2,216 births were registered in the St. George's District, or at the rale of 43 8 per 1,000 of the population. 4,328 births were registered in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 38.5 per 1,000 of the population. 2,710 births were registered in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 33.8 per 1,000 of the population. The birth-rate in the whole of the Borough was 36.7 per 1,000 of the population, while that in London as a whole was 27.9 per 1,000. The birth-rate, though much higher than that of London as a whole, and higher than in the preceding year, is '9 per 1,000 below the average rate in the ten years 1894-1903. With the exception of the years 1899 and 1900, it is the lowest on record. It is the highest birth-rate of any Metropolitan Borough ; and St. George's easily maintains its position of having the highest birth-rate of any district in London. The birth-rate in the Limehouse District is slightly above, while in Mile End and Whitechapel, it is lower than in the previous year. The birth-rate of St. George's is really higher than that recorded, inasmuch as the births that occur in the Mother's Lying-in Home are counted in the district where the home is situated, viz., Mile End, whereas a large number of the births belong to St. George's where the women are brought from. An arrangement has been made with the local Registrars, through the Registrar-General to have this slight discrepancy remedied in future. Illegitimate Births. 19 infants were registered as born out of wedlock in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 10 per 1,000 births. 37 infants were registered as born out of wedlock in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 16.6 per 1,000 births. 5 63 infants were registered as born out of wedlock in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 births. 77 infants were registered as born out of wedlock in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 28 per 1,000 births. The number throughout the whole of the Borough was 196, which corresponds to a rate of 17-5 per 1,000 legitimate births. This number compares very favourably with the number in London as a whole, which was 37 per 1,000 legitimate births. I am afraid, however, that a large number are registered as legitimate, who ought to be entered as illegitimate. Couples have lived together for such a number of years without being legally married, and are looked upon by their neighbours as married people, that the female often deludes herself into thinking that she is married. Living together as man and wife without having entered into the holy bonds of matrimony is a very common practice, especially with couples, of which the female is beyond child bearing age. My experience is, that excluding Jews, quite 20 per cent, of the resident population are not legally married. I know this figure appears to be very high, and probably will be disputed, but I believe, that persons are more likely to give correct answers in this direction to officers of the Sanitary Authority, than they would to Poor-law officials and Clergymen, as it would be to their disadvantage frequently to admit the above to the two latter. Marriages. The marriages during the year numbered 2,663 or 176 less than the previous year. The proportion of persons married was 17.5 per 1,000 of the population, while that for the whole of London was 17 per 1,000. 394 marriages occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 13.5 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 204 marriages occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 8 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 1,497 marriages occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 26 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 568 marriages occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 14 persons married per 1,000 of the population. 6 In St. George's, the marriage rate is exceptionally low, and the birth rate is a great deal higher than in the rest of the Borough. The explanation is, that there is more immigration of aliens into St. George's than anywhere else in London. These immigrants as a rule consists of young married people, and when they come into the district, they displace unmarried people, or married people much older than themselves, and who have become too old to have children. After remaining in St. George's for a few years, these people move to other districts, and their place is taken by fresh aliens in a similar condition, and of a similar age practically re-establishing the pre-existing conditions. The consequence is, that before the children grow up, the families move to other parts, and therefore no marriages occur in the district. This is also borne out by the small number of people that die from old age in St. George's. In the Limehouse district where the population is more stationary, the number of old people that died in 1904 was nearly six times greater than in the St. George's district. Deaths. The total number of deaths occurring in the Borough was 6,115 Deduct deaths occurring within the Borough among persons not belonging thereto 957 5,158 Add deaths of residents that occurred outside the Borough 785 5,943 The deaths therefore, including those of residents which occurred in Outlying Institutions, but exclusive of those of non-residents which occurred in Public Institutions situated in the Borough, numbered 5,943. This corresponds to a death rate of 19.5 per 1,000. 1,350 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 23.2 per 1,000, 1,086 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 21.4 per 1,000. 7 2,099 occurred in the Mile End District or at the rate of 18.2 per 1,000. 1,408 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 17.4 per 1,000. The death-rate is higher than that of 1903, but is 1.7 below the average rate for the preceding ten years. Compared with 1903 the causes of death were:— Disease. 1903. 1904. Increase. Decrease.

H. Lay, 71, Ben Jonson Road, aged 21, who had never been vaccinated. He was a general labourer employed in unloading barges. I could not trace the source of his infection. He had apparently not been in contact with Small Pox, though three cases had occurred in the vicinity of his house, a fortnight previously. The rash appeared on January 12th, and he was removed to the Hospital on January 16th. The district was then free from Small Pox for five weeks, when practically two distinct outbreaks occurred. On January 23rd, Charles Perry, aged 22, was removed from 66, Leman Street—a common lodging house—to the Small Pox Hospital. Perry was a cattle man, and arrived in London on board the cattle boat " Austriana." This 14 ship arrived at Gravesend on February 16th, when the health of all persons on board was reported by the Master to be good, and that there had been no sickness during the voyage. A few hours however, after the men were landed, one of them—a negro—complained of feeling unwell, and was later in the day removed to the Small Pox Hospital. When a case has occurred at a Common Lodging house, the disease has every facility for spreading. In this instance Perry was ill for two days before the rash appeared, and before he complained to any one that he was not feeling well. On the first night of his illness, 87 people slept at this Common Lodging House, and 24 in the same room as the patient. On the following night a similar number slept in the house, but they were not altogether the same people as on the previous evening. As no names are taken at the door, it was quite useless attempting to trace the people that had slept in the same room with Perry, during the previous nights, and before it was discovered that he was suffering from Small Pox. A large number of the people that sleep in Common Lodging Houses, frequently change their lodgings, though I have met some who have occupied the same beds in Common Lodging Houses for a number of years, and in one instance for a period of over 20 years. As a result probably of this case, eight other Common Lodging Houses became infected, and 30 people contracted the disease. They were as follows:— 9 at 66, Leman Street. 10 at 19, Brick Lane. 4 at 39 and 41, Commercial Street. 2 at 24, Thrawl Street. 2 at 28, Thrawl Street. 1 at 90, Wentworth Street. 1 at 42, West India Dock Road. 1 at Medland Hall. One was removed from the Receiving Ward of the Whitechapel Infirmary. He was not admitted into a ward, but was taken at once to the Small Pox Hospital. He had no permanent address. As one Common Lodging House after another became infected, it was evident that as soon as it became known that cases of Small Pox had occurred at 66, Leman Street, those that had come in contact with the disease, went to other Common Lodging Houses, and the disease developed while they were there. Later on, I became suspicious that some person who had the disease in a modified form, was walking about while in an infectious condition. I was 15 strengthened in this belief, as several lads of similar ages, who earned their living by selling newspapers in the streets, contracted Small Pox. These did not live in the same Common Lodging House. I enquired of several of these street newsvendors, whether they had seen any one of their number with a rash on his face. Some said they had, and described the boy to me. They could not say where he generally slept, but told me where his " pitch " was. I went to all the Common Lodging Houses at midnight on several occasions, and examined the inmates, but more especially the newspaper boys. I could not find the one who appeared to have a suspicious rash, and ultimately I found he had left London to attend the races. These boys gain a precarious livelihood in various ways. I do not know whether the boy in question found that I was trying to trace him, and I am not certain that he had Small Pox, or that he was the cause of so many street newsvendors contracting the disease. I was surprised however to find such a large number of young fellows between 15 and 18 years of age, who sleep in Common Lodging Houses every night, and who gain a livelihood in the streets by selling newspapers, &c. On many occasions when I visited the kitchens of these Common Lodging Houses between 11 and 12 p.m., I found four or five of them listening spellbound to some old gaol bird possibly, relating his experiences, &c. Such tales must have a very baneful influence on their young minds, and affect their future behaviour, it would be a magnificent thing if some philanthropist built a home for these lads, to take them away entirely from their evil surroundings. The other outbreak occurred through an unrecognised case being admitted to the London Hospital. On March 16th, I received information from the London Hospital that two patients that had been in the wards for some time, had developed Small Pox. One of the patients resided outside the district, and the other at Old Church Road. I immediately visited the Hospital in order to make inquiries, and to ascertain if possible whether there was any connection between these two cases, and 66, Leman Street. As the result of my investigations, I found that a man named Edward Bovier, of 140, Sydney Street, had been admitted to the same ward as the above two, on February 23rd. At the time of his admission, he had a high temperature, and complained of pains which were thought to be due to Rheumatism. On February 27th, a rash appeared which was considered to be that of Chicken Pox, and as there were children in the ward, the patient was removed to another one, which consisted of a general ward with small rooms abutting on it. Each of these small rooms contained 16 one bed. Bovier was put in one of these rooms. He was thus partly isolated, but not completely so, inasmuch as the nurse that attended to him, nursed other patients as well. There was also direct communication with the general ward. He was discharged from the Hospital on March 12th. Bovier was thus an in-patient for 18 days, which included a period of a fortnight during which the rash was perceptible. Immediately on learning these facts, I visited 140, Sydney Street, but was informed that Bovier was out, selling oilcloth in the streets. I carefully examined the rest of the family, and found that two of the three children showed signs of a rash, which in my opinion was due to Small Pox. Mrs. Bovier informed me that the eldest boy, aged 7, had a rash on March 8th, when she took him to the Hospital. He was examined in the Receiving Room, and Mrs. Bovier was told that he was suffering from Chicken Pox. The mother took him again on March 10th, when he was seen by a different medical man. The latter confirmed the diagnosis, and gave the patient some medicine. A rash appeared on the baby, aged 5 months, a day afterwards. He was seen on one occasion by a local medical man. At the time of my visit on March 16th I thought both were in an infectious condition, and I removed them to the Small Pox Hospital. A few hours later I was able to discover the father. He was even then in an infectious condition, and was removed to the Small Pox Hospital, where he was detained for a period of three weeks. The third child, aged 5, escaped. He was the only vaccinated child in the family. On the following day May Groom, aged 30, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital from the same address. Two other cases in the ward at the London Hospital showed suspicious signs of Small Pox. I advised their removal to the Small Pox Hospital, which was done. All the patients in the two wards where Bovier had been, were offered re-vaccination. All consented to have it done, with the exception of one man, who had been re-vaccinated some time previously. No fresh patients were admitted, and none discharged from these two wards, for a period of a fortnight. I obtained the addresses of all the patients that had been discharged from these two wards during the previous fortnight, and kept them under supervision. No other cases occurred in these wards. Other cases occurred in another borough through coming in contact with Edward Bovier. On April 14th Richard Ryder, aged 9, and Elizabeth Ryder, aged 8, of 59, Brook Street, were removed to the Small Pox Hospital. On the following day their mother, and on April 16th Emily Ryder, aged 6, were also removed. The mother had been vaccinated in infancy, but neither of the children had been vaccinated. 17 On April 23rd Ernest Clark, of 97, Shandy Street, aged 21, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital. He was employed as a cooper with a firm in Bromley, where the father of the above three children was also employed. On May 9th I received a notification that Henry Drablow, aged 22, of 13, Durham Row, was suffering from Chicken Pox. I visited the premises and examined the patient. I was of opinion that he was suffering from Small Pox, and he was removed. The patient, as well as his relations, denied that he had been anywhere in contact with, or even in the same house as, anyone suffering from Small Pox. Later on, however, I found that he had been in the habit Of visiting 97, Shandy Street, where I have no doubt be contracted the disease. On May 11th I received an anonymous communication that a case of Small Pox was concealed at 1, Knott Street. On visiting the premises I found James Kelsey, aged 14 years, a cripple, suffering from the disease. From the appearance of the rash, which was about three days old, I came to the conclusion that the patient had been ill about six days. All the people in the house denied that they had been in contact with anyone suffering from Small Pox. The features of one of the women seemed to be familiar, and I afterwards remembered that on April 23rd when I was examining Ernest Clark at 97, Shandy Street, she came into the bedroom for a few minutes. She was the grandmother of Kelsey. On that occasion she gave me her name, which I afterwards found to be false. She had also given her address as 21, Durham Row, but left that house a day or two afterwards. When asked why a medical man had not been called in to see the patient, the relatives could not give a satisfactory reason. Proceedings were taken against Mrs. Brown—the grandmother of the boy—and she was fined 40s. and 23s. costs, for concealing the case, and not notifying it or calling in a medical man to do so. In addition to Mrs. Brown, there were left in the house three daughters and two grandchildren. I advised them to be vaccinated, with the exception of Mrs. Brown, who had been successfully re-vaccinated five years previously, but they refused. On May 21st, the two grandchildren were taken ill, and one died before he could be removed. Both were 5 years of age, and neither had ever been vaccinated. On May 22nd and May 23rd, two of the daughters were removed to the Small Pox Hospital. On May 23rd, Agnes Harrison, aged 10, of 22a, Durham Row, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital. The Patient herself had not been in contact B 18 with Small Pox, but her brother had visited Drablow, and had been in the bedroom with him for an hour previous to his removal. No one had been from Drablow's house to 22a, Durham Row. On May 26th, Sarah Adams, aged 22, was removed from 30, Cadiz Street. This house is in close vicinity to 1, Knott Street. On June 7th, Edith Harrison, aged 15, of 22a, Durham Row, was taken ill and removed to the Hospital on June 9th. These cases illustrate the great danger from indirect contact. Neither Ernest Clark, James Kelsey, nor Sarah Adams, had been themselves in a house where Small Pox existed. The persons that had been in actual contact with the disease, did not contract Small Pox, but gave it to others who had not been near the persons so suffering. On June 9th, I was asked by a medical man to visit Thomas Roake, aged 24, of 7, Dock Street. The patient had been empoyed as an undertaker's assistant, in Walthamstow. On May 21st, in the course of his employment, he visited a house to measure the body of a boy, aged 5, who was supposd to have died from Chicken Pox. A few days afterwards, he again visited the same premises to put the body in a coffin. Mr. Roake was undoubtedly suffering from Small Pox when I examined him, and he was removed to the Hospital. He had never been vaccinated. From his description of the body, I thought the child that he had coffined must have died from Small Pox, and not from Chicken Pox. I at once communicated with the Medical Officer of Health of that district, who visited the premises in question. He found five children suffering from Small Pox, who were being treated for Chicken Pox. Three, if not four, others had been infected prior to the Medical Officer of Health's visit. Two other cases—besides Perry mentioned above—developed Small Pox within a day or two of their arrival in London. Both came from Russia, one being on the way to New York, and had only intended staying in London for a few days. Two other cases—besides Perry mentioned above—developed Small Pox within a day or two of their arrival in London. Both came from Russia, one being on the way to New York, and had only intended staying in London for a few days. NAME AND ADDRESS. Age. Date of Illness. Date of appearance of Rash. Date of Removal.

The number of deaths was 176, or 14 more than in the preceding year. 40 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 68 per 1,000. 46 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 91 per 1,000. 65 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 56 per 1000. 25 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 31 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole Borough was at the rate of 57 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was 49 per 1,000. In my last Annual Report, 1 called attention to the absurdity of applying certain sections only, of the Public Health London Act to Measles, which came into force on April 1st, 1903. All the sections referring to other notifiable diseases were made to apply, with the exception of the one referring to the necessity of notifying the disease to the Medical Officer of Health. We have full power to enforce disinfection, etc., but we have no means of knowing who are suffering from the disease. It was thought at first that information would be obtained from Schools. It is true 1 receive information from teachers, that certain scholars have been absent from school since a certain date. The information is of no use to us, for several reasons. At the time I receive the information, the children have often been absent from school a fortnight, or longer. The teachers have no proof that the cause of the absence of the child is Measles. Probably they have been so informed by another child. This is quite unreliable, and when the mother of the child is afterwards interviewed by the Sanitary Inspector, she indignantly denies that the child has had Measles, and refuses to have the rooms and clothing disinfected. I do not see that it is possible for us to legally insist on the disinfection, if they persist in denying the truth of the statement made by the teacher. We cannot controvert their word, and if we took proceedings against them, the Magistrate would have to dismiss the case. It would assist us if the teachers refused to accept any excuse, as to the cause of the child's absence, except a statement made in writing. It would be mors difficult for the parents afterwards to deny, than a mere verbal statement, made possibly through another child. Scarlet Fever, 1,155 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, of which 1,033 were removed to the various Fever Hospitals. 23 185 occurred in the Limehouse District, with 2 deaths. 210 occurred in the St. George's District, with 6 deaths. 443 occurred in the Mile End District, with 11 deaths 317 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 13 deaths. The death-rate for the whole Borough was TO, while that for the whole of London was 08 per 1,000 of the population. Whooping Cough. The number of deaths was 131, or 26 more than in the preceding year. This corresponds to a death-rate of .43 per 1,000 of the population. 34 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .58 per 1,000 of the population. 42 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .83 per 1,000 of the population. 33 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .28 per 1,000 of the population. 22 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .27 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout London was .33 per 1,000. Diphtheria. 725 cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year, and 643 were removed to the Fever Hospitals. There were 89 deaths corresponding to a death-rate of .29 per 1,000 of the population. 104 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, with 18 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .30 per 1,000 of the population. 160 cases occurred in the St. George's District, with 15 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .29 per 1,000 of the population. 271 cases occurred in the Mile End District, with 28 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .24 per 1,000 of the population. 190 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 28 deaths, which is equivalent to a death-rate of .34 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate for the whole of London was 16 per 1,000. 24 Croup. 8 cases were notified, but none were removed to the Fever Hospital. 3 occurrred in the Limehouse District, and one proved fatal. None occurred in the St George's District. 3 occurred in the Mile End District, and one proved fatal. 2 occurred in the Whitechapel District; both recovered. Typhus Fever. One case occurred in Mile End. Enteric Fever. 183 cases occurred during the year, of which 160 were removed to the various Hospitals. 28 proved fatal, which corresponds to a death-rate of .09 per 1,000. 51 cases occurred in the Limehouse District, with 11 deaths, which corresponds to a death-rate of 18 per 1,000 of the population . 25 cases occurred in the St. George's District, with 5 deaths, which corresponds to a death-rate of 09 per 1,000 of the population. 79 cases occurred in the Mile End District, with 9 deaths, which corresponds to a death-rate of 07 per 1,000 of the population. 28 cases occurred in the Whitechapel District, with 3 deaths, which corresponds to a death-rate of .03 per 1,000 of the population. The death-rate throughout London was 08 per 1,000. Erysipelas. 457 cases were notified, and 77 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 73 occurred in the Limehouse District; four died. 93 occurred in the St. George's District; none proved fatal. 155 occurred in the Mile End District; eight died. 136 occurred in the Whitechapel District; seven died.

The number of deaths from Diarrhoea, which includes Epidemic and Zymotic Enteritis, Dysentery and Dysenteric Diarrhoea, Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhoea, was 172. Of these, 129 were infants under one year of age. 44 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .75 per 1,000. 32 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .63 per 1,000. 74 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .65 per 1,000. 22 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .27 per 1,000 The death-rate in the whole of the Borough was .56 per 1,000. Enteritis, The number of deaths from Enteritis, which includes Gastro-Enteritis, Muco-Enteritis, and Gastric Catarrh, was 318. Of this number 243 were children under one year of age. 64 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.10 per 1,000. 64 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 1.26 per 1,000. 103 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .89 per 1,000. 87 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.08 per 1,000. Taking Diarrhoea and Enteritis together, the death-rate in the whole of the Borough from these diseases, was 1.61 per 1,000. Puerperal Fever. 15 cases of Puerperal Fever were notified. 5 occurred in the Limehouse District, with four deaths. 5 occurred in the St, George's District, with five deaths. 2 occurred in the Mile End District, with two deaths. 3 occurred in the Whitechapel District, with one death. Zymotic Diseases. The total deaths from Zymotic Diseases numbered 645. This number corresponds to a death-rate of 212 per 1,000 of the population. It includes deaths from Small Pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever. Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Croup, Enteric Fever, Puerperal Fever, and Diarrhoea. 26 154 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.64 per 1,000. 151 occurred in the St George's District, or at the rate of 2.98 per 1,000. 224 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 1.94 per 1,000. 116 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 1.44 per 1,000. Diseases of Respiratory Organs. There were 1,169 deaths due to diseases of Respiratory Organs, whicn corresponds to a death-rate of 3 84 per 1,000 of the population. 260 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 4.46 per 1,000. 228 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 4.51 per 1,000. 389 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 3.47 per 1,000. 292 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 3 64 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality. 1,773 infants died under one year of age. This is equal to a death-rate of 158 8 per 1,000 births. This number exceeds that of the previous year by 174, when the rate was 141 per 1,000 births. 397 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 208.3 per 1,000 births. 357 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 161.1 per 1,000 births. 631 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 145.7 per 1,000 births. 388 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 143.1 per 1,000 births. Old Age. 228 deaths were due to Old Age. This corresponds to a death-rate of •75 per 1,000 of the population. 71 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 1.22 per 1,000. 12 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .23 per 1,000. 105 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .91 per 1,000. 40 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .49 per 1,000. 21 Alcoholism. The number of deaths due to Alcoholism and Cirrhosis of the Liver was 96. Cancer. The number of deaths from Cancer was 240. Deaths from Cancer increase rapidly from year to year. This is not only true in our own district, but unfortunately it is on the increase in other districts as well. Notifiable Diseases. Excluding Chicken Pox, 2,626 cases of infectious disease were notified during the year, and 1,995 were removed to various Hospitals and Infirmaries. 432 occurred in the Limehouse District. 495 occurred in the St. George's District. 984 occurred in the Mile End District. 715 occurred in the Whitechapel District. Phthisis. 689 Deaths occurred from Phthisis during the year. This corresponds to a death-rate of 2 26 per 1,000 of the population. 143 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of 2.45 per 1,000. 119 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of 2.35 per 1,000. 229 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of 1.99 per 1,000. 198 occurred in the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of 2.47 per 1,000. In addition to the above, there were 174 deaths from other Tubercular diseases. This corresponds to a death-rate of .57 per 1,000 of the population. 44 occurred in the Limehouse District, or at the rate of .75 per 1,000. 35 occurred in the St. George's District, or at the rate of .69 per 1,000. 61 occurred in the Mile End District, or at the rate of .53 per 1,000. 34 occurred at the Whitechapel District, or at the rate of .42 per 1,000. The death-rate for the whole of London from Phthisis was 1.62 per 1,000 of the population. 28 In some cases the patients, before they died, suffered from Tubercular diseases of other organs, and these facts were inserted in the death certificates. Phthisis, or Tubercular diseases of the Lungs, may then have been mentioned as a secondary cause. A phthisical patient may contract Pneumonia, and the latter disease may be the immediate cause of death. Inasmuch as the patient was actually suffering from Phthisis at the time of death, I have entered the cause of death under Phthisis. The above probably accounts for the fact that the death-rate from Phthisis, according to my enumeration, is slightly higher than that given by the Registrar-General, which was 212 per 1,000. The death-rate from Phthisis was the fourth highest of the Metropolitan Boroughs. The annual average for the previous 3 years was 2 08 per 1,000. Admitted to be a preventible disease, the question of taking steps to lower the high death-rate was discussed by the Public Health Committee on several occasions During the latter part of the year, a sub-committee was appointed to enquire into, and report on the advisability of making Phthisis a notifiable disease. The sub-committee requested me to communicate with the Medical Officers of Health of those Districts that have adopted voluntary notification, and to find out what success has been attained thereby. I sent out circulars asking for particulars under the following headings: — Voluntary Notifcation of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. (1) Name of District. (2) Population. (3) What has been the average death-rate from Pulmonary Phthisis for the last 5 years ? (4) How long has voluntary notification been in force, and what fee is offered ? (5) What has been the average annual cost of notifications ? (6) Do you find that the same case is notified more than once ? If so, have any means been adopted to check this possible abuse ? (7) Has the system caused any friction between the Medical men and their patients—better class as well as poorer? (8) What means are adopted to show that the patient consented to notification ? Do you issue a special form ? 29 (9) Do you find that the patients (especially those in the early stages) resent this notification? (10) What is your method of disinfecting rooms ? (11) Have you found any material educational advantage resulting from it, e.g., greater carefulness in the patients habits ? (12) Do you only admit those cases as notifications where Tubercle Bacilli have been found bacteriologically ? (13) Is notification restricted to Pulmonary Tuberculosis? (14) Do you send a note of advice as to disinfection, where a patient with Pulmonary Phthisis resides, or has died ? (15) What is the source of the fees that you pay medical men for the notifications? (Metropolitan Asylums Board, Borough funds, &c.). (16) Do you include Infirmaries, Hospitals, &c., as institutions whence notifications are received ? (17) What other steps do you take in cases notified to you besides disinfection ? Is there any co-operation in dealing with these cases between the Local Authority and Voluntary Societies ? (18) Any further remarks. Replies were received from the Sanitary Authorities of 10 Metropolitan and 28 other Boroughs, 12 Urban and 3 Rural District Councils. Of these. the following constitutes a brief summary : — Metropolitan Boroughs, with populations ranging from 52,000 to 270,000, and an average death-rate for the last 5 years for all age periods, due to Pulmonary Phthisis extending from 1.05 per 1,000 to 2.98 per 1,000. In all these, voluntary notification has been in force for the last 2 or 3 years, and the fees offered are 2s. 6d. for cases occurring in private practice, and Is. for cases in public institutions. Average Annual Cost. It was lowest in Chelsea—£2 in 1904,—highest in Southwark (£24), and Holborn—£20 9s. 6d.—The two latter, also, had the highest average deathrate from Phthisis: Southwark (2.55 per 1,000), Holborn (2.98 per 1,000). 30 A comparison of the population, and the Phthisis death-rate, makes it at once obvious that in many of these Boroughs, the number of cases notified, is exceeded by the number of deaths from Phthisis; and, therefore, much more so by the number of those afflicted with the malady. In other words, the number of cases notified, is but a small fraction of the cases actually suffering. Overlapping of Notifications. Four boroughs report in the negative. Of the rest, some authorities pay for a second notification of the same case after the lapse of a certain period. By this means they retain a hold on the patient's address, and new place of abode—if removal has ensued,—and are thereby enabled to offer disinfection and other sanitary measures to the owner of the premises vacated. Others do not accept a second notification, and one accepts and pays for such second notification, when a change of address has occurred. Secondary notification is chiefly found among the poorer classes, who have no fixed " family physician." Finding no relief from their sufferings at the hands of one practitioner, they consult another, the small fee charged for advice encouraging the practice. When for any reason, such, as, for example— removal to an infirmary—the patient is removed from his last address, a second notification is valuable, as it enables the premises to be disinfected before the entry of the incoming tenant. Friction. Nine boroughs answer negatively; one has no information on this head, and two authorities state that very few better class cases are notified. It is in these latter cases that friction is most likely to arise, for the poor, who have learnt to regard the sanitary authorities and their officials with awe and discrimination, are apt to regard notifications of this kind as something " to do with the law," and accept such as inevitable. Its evasion is thought to be fraught with the infliction of heavy penalties. Generally speaking, therefore, there may be said to be no evidence of friction apparent, for, on the one hand, those cases which would give rise to it, are not notified; whereas, on the other, those cases which are notified are those of patients which, by environment and circumstances are not disposed to complain of it. The foregoing refers to friction between patients and sanitary authorities. 31 With regard to general practitioners and the authorities, there is no doubt that notification of these cases does give rise to considerable unpleasantness, despite the absence of direct affirmative evidence to that effect. This friction may be in part possibly lessened by the Health authorities deferring or postponing indefinitely a visit to the patient, on the request of the medical man in attendance. Consent of Patient. In 3 Boroughs this is not considered necessary, but in two others it is assumed. In one Borough (Stoke Newington) the patient's consent is formally given on the notification form. In one it is said to be left to the discretion of the Medical attendant, and, in another the patient's consent is obtained by the doctor notifying. In Greenwich, the patient's consent is not asked; if a visit from the Public Health Authority is not desired, the practitioner attending, so endorses the certificate. On the main question, a matter affecting the patient so closely, it is obvious that his consent ought to be obtained in writing, if possible, on the notification certificate. Finsbury alone has issued a special form. Attitude of Patient. Seven Boroughs replied that there is no resentment, the rest have no information on this score. It is, as stated above, generally conceded, that the better class patients resent notification exceedingly, and, therefore, are not notified, but the lower class patients in humble life regard it as something partaking of the absolute and irremediable, and do not voice their annoyance. Disinfection. Six Boroughs use formalin by spray or fumigation, and one of these resorts to this expedient once a week. Three use sulphur fumigation; in others the walls are sprayed with cyllin, corrosive sublimate, or carbolic, and then stripped. The bedding is steamed. 32 On the general question of disinfection, the proper place for this would appear to be after the removal or death of a patient. It is evident that as long as an infected patient inhabits a house or room, no amount of disinfection would more than temporarily arrest the accretion of the organism on the walls, floor, utensils and furniture, inasmuch as the patient—the source of the mischief—would continue to give forth germs in abundance over the same area of distribution. In order that such disinfection should even be temporarily thorough, it would be necessary to disinfect all his clothes, his hair, his finger nails, mouth, and body surface. Tne disadvantages and objections to this are manifest. Furthermore, at its conclusion, the same condition which necessitated the primary disinfection would be almost immediately reestablished, rendering necessary a second, third, and indefinite number of operations at frequent intervals, without a corresponding hope of ultimate finality, or even proportionate resulting advantage. The most practicable method would appear to be the offer, or imposition of, one general disinfection of rooms and contents, e.g., furniture, clothes, &c., followed by the provision, or suggestion of special cups for expectoration, with instructions as to its disposal and sterilisation, as well as the use and control of personal and kitchen utensils. Educational Advantages. Here the authorities are almost unanimous as to the improvement manifested, and the advantages derived. It is questionable, however, whether the same result might not be obtained without notification, and without causing the latent friction now often demonstrated, as well as the resentment incurred, by the kindly advice, instruction and suggestion of the medical man attending. The chief facts to be impressed are : — (1) The disease is caused by a micro-organism. (2) The unity of Tubercle, whether the source be Consumption of the Lungs, a Tuberculous gland, a Psoas abscess or other focus, the essential organisms are one and indissoluble, and not to be distinguished from one another by any known chemical or biological method. (3) The method of dissemination of the Tubercle bacillus and its prevention: — (a) Here the sputum plays the chief part, but the discharges from caseating abscesses and tuberculous sinuses, also contain the tubercle bacillus. They are, therefore, possible sources of infection as long as, 33 if not for a longer period than an ordinary case of consumption. These latter foci are often overlooked and discarded, but if the crusade is to be effectual, they must be subjected to the same rigid supervision, scrutiny, hygienic treatment and restrictions, as are imposed on a case of pulmonary phthisis. (b) Indirect spread of infection by utensils. A phthisical patient at every meal leaves a large number of baccilli on all the utensils he uses. When these are used indiscriminately for the whole household there is a danger that the next user may be infected. Let us follow him at breakfast, his cup is placed to his lips and withdrawn, bearing a small quantity of mucus which may trickle down to the saucer. This mucus may contain the specific germ. In the act of eating, his fork is introduced into the mouth, and replaced on the plate bearing the specific organism too. Thus before the end of the meal in all probability the whole of his utensils, the adjacent tablecloth and napkin (if any) are infected. Even if they are washed, as they generally are in luke-warm water in a bowl, this is not sufficient to Kill off the germ, but is, instead, a further means of spreading to the utensils of the unaffected inmates. For it must be remembered that the tubercle germ is a particulate thing, (not a mere miasma, or ethereal abstraction), and as such, subject to the usual laws of gravity in the same proportionate degree as the largest boulder. In the act of washing kitchen utensils, done by the rough and ready householder by wiping one wet rag (common to all) round the rim, and into the bowl of cup and saucer, tne mucus is carried from one article to another. The wet rag and dry rag become both infected, and sources of further spread. The inference is that the consumptive should have his own utensils, and that these should be cleaned by themselves, preferably in warm water containing an alkaline disinfectant. (c) Indirect spread bv handkerchief. It were better to use the thin gauzy paper handkerchief to be burnt at the end of the day, or failing this, spare bits of household rag. (d) The care of the Sputum. By expectoration into recognised sputum cups or flasks, or as under (c). c 34 Class of Tuberculosis Admitted. All the Boroughs accept notifications which are based on clinical signs and symptoms; four occasionally obtained bacteriological confirmation, but do not insist upon this as an essential preliminary to notification. This waiving of confirmation by microscopic methods is wise, seeing that in the early stages of a large majority of cases, it is most difficult to obtain, and often, only after frequent and repeated examinations of the sputum. At present all the Boroughs restrict notification to pulmonary tuberculosis, which is comparable to only accepting notifications of Diphtheria, which relate to the Larynx, allowing cases affecting the nose or Pharynx to run riot. It would be better to accept notifications of Tubercle irrespective of the site of the disease, but with the proviso, that in the case of discharging abscesses and sinuses, bacteriological confirmation should be forthcoming. Notice of Disinfection. Six Boroughs send no notices, but four do. In two, an Inspector calls and offers disinfection; in one, the consumptive room is fumigated weekly, and the bedding occasionally steamed. In one (Stoke Newington) the authorities are almost invariably asked to disinfect after death. In Woolwich, a notice of disinfection is accompanied by the special card of instruction. It would be best in my opinion to offer disinfection on death or removal, and to let an Inspector call, rather than send formal notice. Inclusion of Public Institutions. All the Boroughs include Public Institutions as sources of notification. The wisdom of this course will be appreciated when it is known that numberless cases of Phthisis never come under medical treatment at all, until they are almost moribund. This especially is the case with the very poor, the homeless and unemployed. 35 They struggle on, despite the cough that rakes head and chest, and the pain of occasional localised Pleurisy, until at last the weakness that is insuperable, makes further resistance useless. The sufferer is then taken to an hospital or infirmary, and perhaps for the first time, comes under medical supervision. The objection to the inclusion of public institutions is the risk of overlapping, but in practice it has been found that those cases are very few. Other Steps besides Disinfection. These include the issue of leaflets of instructions and precautions to the patient, and members of the family, as well as to dispensaries and other public institutions, for distribution among appropriate cases. This is done by four Boroughs, and is the most popular of all measures. Others are the provision of fibre handkerchiefs, and pocket spittoons, sold at cost price; the requisite disinfectants are given gratis. In some Boroughs, the Medical Officer of Health visits the house and ascertains the duration, and probable source of illness, the presence of any other cases in the house, inspects the work-place, and gives generally, advice orally. A sanitarv survey of the premises is made by an Inspector with a view to detecting defects in drainage or construction. In three districts, further periodical visitations are made to see that the instructions on the leaflet are carried out as well as circumstances permit. Most Authorities examine the sputum for Tubercle gratis on request. Woolwich retains two beds in a country sanatorium, and gives treatment therein to selected cases, each for a period of three months. C o-operation of Voluntary Societies. This is at present very meagre, and confined to the Charity Organisation Society, the Almoners of Local Institutions, and Jewish Board of Guardians During the year 46 premises in our District were disinfected at the request of the Jewish Board of Guardians. Further Remarks. Finsbury complains that the chief difficulty is the lack of early cases, the cases notified are those of patients far on in the disease, and often moribund. In Stoke Newington the Medical Officer of Health endeavours to get patients removed to hospital or sanatorium. C 2 36 Boroughs other than Metropolitan. Replies were received from 28 Boroughs, with populations ranging from 29,000 to 730,000, and an average death-rate from Phthisis for the last five years from .94 to 2.06. In these, notification has been in force for periods varying from one to six years. The fees paid are those usual in other infectious diseases, but some Boroughs pay 1/- only when a second notification of the same case is received. Costs.—Annual Average. The costs vary from 7/6 in Exeter to £160 in Liverpool. The system in Birkenhead is unpaid and voluntary, with the consequence that no notifications have been received. In Exeter, although the scheme has been in operation for three years, yet during that time only ten notifications have been received. The population is 47,000, and the Phthisis death-rate 14, giving roughly, 65 deaths annually from this cause alone. As no double notifications are received, the number is one-twentieth of the deaths occurring from this disease. In Huddersfield, the Medical Officer of Health has not received notice of a single case of Phthisis outside of the death returns, nor a single sputum for examination. In Sheffield, notification has been compulsory since October, 1903. Before that time, the annual cost was about £27, and this included a number of double notifications. Since compulsory notification was introduced, the annual cost has been £95, and, this, despite the fact that now no second notification is accepted. It follows that less than one-quarter of the cases actually known and recognised were notified. Overlapping of Notifications. Overlapping does not occur in 13 Boroughs, but occasionally in the rest. Most are agreed that there is no abuse. 37 Friction. Twenty-three Boroughs say no, but this is in many instances qualified by the remark " The Medical Officer of Health is not aware of any," " The better class cases are not notified," or " There is no friction because so little has been done." Evidence of friction, however, is forthcoming at Accrington, where the local practitioners refuse to notify, unless the Sanitary Authority undertook not to visit the patients, so that the information is only available for spot-maps. Consent of Patient. Nearly all Boroughs do not issue a special form, and do not require the consent of the patient. Eastbourne and Warrington alone, issue a special form. In most cases the question of consent is left to the medical man's discretion, and in one Borough, the doctor is specially asked to get consent before notifying. Attitude of Patient. In most of the Boroughs, the patient is said not to resent notification; in two he is even said to be " thankful for the attention." In four of the Boroughs, there has been definite resentment. In Sheffield, where there is a special Phthisis Inspector, and notification is conpulsory, there has been resentment only if the medical man had not informed the patient of the fact of notification. In one Borough, " if the patient resents, there is no notification." Briefly it will appear that the resentment to a large extent depends upon the social status of the patient, and the want of tact and discretion in the medical man and sanitary authorities. Disinfection. The most popular is Formalin in the form of spray or fumigation. The bedding and other textile material are steamed. Sulphur fumigation is done in a good many instances. These two methods and stripping the walls are employed in one or other form by almost all the Boroughs. 38 Among other agents employed in the form of spray, swab, or fumigation, are Corrosive Sublimate, Izal, Chlorinated Lime, Chloros, Cyllin, and Carbolic Acid. Educational Advantages. The replies were in the affirmative in 15 Boroughs, negative in 5, and doubtful in 5. Class of Cases. Doncaster alone insists on bacteriological confirmation prior to notification. The other Boroughs accept a notification from any registered practitioner without it. Restriction of Notification. All Boroughs save two, admit notifications only when referring to Tubercle of the Lungs, the other two admit Tubercle elsewhere. Notice of Disinfection. In most cases an Inspector calls and endeavours to arrange for disinfection with the friends of the patient or landlord. In nine Boroughs, notice of disinfection is sent. In two Boroughs, the Medical Officer of Health visits, and requests facilities for disinfection, and impresses the necessity of the measure. In one Borough, a Health visitor calls, and asks for permission to have it done. Source of Payment. Chiefly Borough or District Funds, including the Borough and General Rates. In one Borough, the payment is made from the " Sanitary Rate," and in another there is no payment, as there are no funds out of which the Local Authority can pay the fees—the consequence is that in this Borough there are no notifications. 39 Inclusion of Local Institutions. All Boroughs, except one, include infirmaries, hospitals, and other local institutions, as places whence notifications may be received. Other Steps. These are: — (a) Periodical visits by the Medical Officer of Health, Inspector or Health visitor, with a report as to the sanitary condition of the house at the time of visit, and the efficiency with which the instructions given, are carried out, as well as on the progress of the case. One Borough appoints two special Tuberculosis Inspectors. (b) An endeavour to impress the necessity of the open air treatment, and an attempt to institute a modified variety, adapted to home treatment, by insisting on open windows night and day, &c. (c) A sanitary inspection of the premises with the rectification of auy defects thus brought to light. (d) Bacteriological examination of the milk supply. (e) Issue of leaflet of instruction, and precautions to be left at house of patient, and placards for workshops and public places. (/) Provision of paper or fibre handkerchiefs, and appropriate spittoons, either gratis or for payment. (g) Restriction of indiscriminate spitting. (h) Disinfection which may be periodical, or at death, or removal of patient, or, on the entrance of a new family into a house. (i) Provision of disinfectants for personal use and for spittoons. (/') One Borough endeavours to secure removal of patients to the Borough Hospital, where it retains a block of 18 beds for that purpose, and has erected shelters in the grounds. Another notifies the cases to the local branch of the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption, which tries to obtain removal of the case to a Sanatorium. 40 Co-operation. Very little is done in the matter by voluntary societies but what little there is, is due to the Local Mcdical Societies and the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption. Other Remarks. The small number of notifications seems to be almost universal where the method is voluntary. Indeed, some authorities frankly state that voluntary notification has been a "failure" and "disappointing," and practically confined to the poorer classes and moribund patients. One authority places the advantages as chiefly educational. Another complains that the instructions given on the official leaflet, are wilfully discarded at home; while one believes that notification itself will not be effective unless provision is simultaneously made for treatment in hospital. Urban Districts. As in the case of Metropolitan and other Boroughs, here, too, the same facts are disclosed and the same inferences follow. There seems, however, to be a larger consensus of opinion that voluntary notification has been a failure. One Council (Wigston) advises and practices the education of school children in the home hygienic measures, which are necessary for coping with the evil. Rural Districts. In the Rural Districts where voluntary notification has been adopted, the authorities are unanimous that it has been a failure. General Summary and Conclusions. When we consider that in London alone, between 7,000 and 8,000 persons (of whom a large majority are adults in the prime of life) die every year from Consumption, and that the mortality in the male sex is about 40 per cent. greater than in the female sex, it is to be regretted that so little has been accomplished as the result of the efforts of those authorities who have attempted to grapple with this infectious disease. It must be at once conceded that the experience of nearly all the Medical Officers of Health, is that the Medical Practitioners have not availed themselves of the opportunities offered to them by the Sanitary Authorities in the 41 war against Tuberculosis. The main cause of this probably is, that the Medical attendant fears that his patient will be annoyed, and will dispense with his services, if he brings him (the patient) into contact with the Sanitary Authority. He fears that the patient will leave him for another medical man, who possibly has the reputation of never notifying such cases. The result is, that the cases notified are those of persons in very poor circumstances, and those who are nearly moribund. Many Metropolitan Boroughs have adopted voluntary notification for several years, but at the present time, one only supports beds (two in number) in a country sanatorium for the benefit of the inhabitants within its confines. Despite the enthusiasm with which the subject has been kindled in the lay press, and despite the whole-hearted and persistent endeavours of the various Sanitary authorities, there is no room for doubt that voluntary notification has been an utter failure. Indeed, many of the authorities frankly acknowledge this. » Take two of the Metropolitan Boroughs as examples: The first has a population of 74.000, with a death-rate of 168 per 1,000. The number of deaths from Phthisis was 124, but the number of notifications received was 16. In this particular Borough no double notifications are acknowledged. Allowing that there are five persons suffering from the disease for every one death, we have a percentage of 2.2 actually notified. Of the number of persons that die from Phthisis 13 per cent. only had been previously notified. Take another Borough, with a population of 100,000, with a death-rate from Phthisis of 1.17 per 1,000. In this Borough double notifications are received. The number of deaths was 121, but the number of notifications, including secondary notifications, was 93. Including the secondary notifications as equivalent to fresh cases, and making no allowance for this, 75 per cent. of the deaths had been previously notified. This is assuming, of course, that none but the fatal cases were notified. This particular Borough is a very poor one, and the inhabitants are very unlikely to show their resentment. Moreover, it is probable, that owing to the cheapness of the fees charged for medical advice, some of the notifications were sent in twice, tnree, or even four times. In these poor localities, when a man is notified as suffering from any infection, which is said to be infectious, and attended by notification, nothing is commoner, than, that he should resort to other practitioners, in order that he may have what he considers to be a stigma—removed. Furthermore, 42 the frequent removals from one house to the other, which is common to this class, and the absence of definite improvement in the disease, tend to induce the patient to seek fresh medical aid. Even in Liverpool, where £160 is paid yearly in notification fees, and double notification is occasional, the number of notifications do not equal the number of deaths that occur. Sheffield affords an instructive example, inasmuch as notification was voluntary from 1899 to 1903, and was made compulsory in October, 1903. Sheffield has a population of 440,000, and the annual average death-rate from Phthisis has been 1.33 per 1,000. When the notification was voluntary, the average number of notifications received in a year was 216. Since it has been compulsory, the number has been 760 during the year. Before October, 1903, 15 per cent. of the notifications were second ones of the same case. Since October, 1903, second notifications are not accepted. The annual number of deaths was 585. Before compulsory notification came into force, the number of notifications per annum was less than the number of deaths, and less than one-third of what they were afterwards. It must be remembered that here, as in all the other places, notification is restricted to Pulmonary Phthisis, and the number by no means represents a complete list of those afflicted with Tubercle in all its forms. It will, therefore, be seen that the number of notifications received is but a fraction of the number of the deaths occurring from Pulmonary Phthisis, and is still a smaller fraction of the cases known to occur and still living. The benefit that is claimed as the result of voluntary notification is educational. This has again been mainly the result of residence in a Sanatorium. A patient when ne resides in a Sanatorium is compelled to do certain things, and after his return home, he not only adheres to the rules himself, but he becomes the means of teaching others that come into contact with him. When we realise that for every death, there are about five others that suffer from Phthisis in various stages, we have some idea of the number of Sanatoria that would be necessary for the effectual dealing with even the most suitable of the 40,000 persons, that suffer from the disease in London alone Unfortunately, some people rush to the conclusion that the erection of a few Sanatoria is going to immediately stamp out the disease throughout the country. 43 I hope the number of Sanatoria will increase year by year, so that the patients can be removed in the early stages to them, and that Phthisis may be recognised by people generally as a disease that is so curable. I am afraid the advantages to be gained by making it a notifiable disease will not prove of very great benefit to the community, unless further action is possible. Even if the number of Sanatoria will be increased every year, it must be borne in mind that it will be a great many years before this alone will have much material effect on the death-rate from Phthisis. It must also not be lost sight of, that two or three months residence in a Sanatorium is not an absolute cure for consumption. The cure is more or less of a temporary nature, and provision should be made for the after life of the patient in pure air and with open air work. If at the end of three months residence the patient returns to his former unsuitable and unhealthy occupation, the results will be found to be disappointing. Homeless. 99 deaths occurred at the Whitechapel Infirmary and Workhouse, and 10 at the Mile End Infirmary, among persons admitted from the streets without an address or temporary lodgings of any kind. They were described as homeless. This number does not, of course, include those that were admitted from Common Lodging Houses, nor does it include those deaths that occurred at various lunatic asylums, where no addresses could be given. Twenty deaths occurred at the latter institutions stated to have been taken there from the Stepney Union, 9 were said to belong to St. George's, 10 to Mile End, and 27 to Whitechapel. 44 ARTICLES DISINFECTED DURING THE YEAR.

Unsound Food. A large quantity of unsound food was surrendered during the year, the greater part being taken from the wharves. The quantity surrendered at the wharves was less than in the previous year, and it would be still less had not two big fires occurred in July and August, which rendered large quantities of foodstuffs which they contained, quite unfit for human food. There was less unsound fruits imported than in the previous year. For instance, 5 cwt. of plums were destroyed compared with 185 tons in the previous year. At one of the wharf fires referred to above, about 300 tons of various spices, e.g., pepper, ginger, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, &c., were rendered unsound and unfit for human consumption. Proceedings were taken against vendors of unsound food and convictions were obtained in five cases. Two were dismissed as will be seen later on. In one case, exceptional difficulties were encountered due to the fact that the ultimate destination of the unsound food was to a person who sold human food as well as cat's meat. Unfortunately there is nothing to prevent this system being carried on. If I enter a tripe dresser's shop and find diseased meat being exposed for sale, the owner immediately states that it is not intended for human food, and is only meant for cats meat. He points out meat that can obviously only be sold as cat's meat. The same thing happens if I enter that part of the premises where the meat is cooked and prepared. Human food and cat's meat are boiled in boilers side by side. If there is any diseased meat being prepared, it is claimed that it is not intended for human food. As 46 a legitimate trade is being carried on in cat's meat, I am obliged to accept the statement, though frequently I have doubts whether it would not have found its way into brawns, &c. and sold as human food, if I had not visited the premises and noticed it. There are scores of these shops in the district, as well as in other parts of London. So long as human food and cat's meat are allowed to be prepared and sold on the same premises, this state of affairs will be a menace to Public Health. Some tradesmen of course are perfectly genuine and honest, and they can be trusted to prepare only sound and wholesome food for human consumption, but there are others who are not so scrupulous. On January 12th, Mr. Barnet Silver, 12, Coke Street, was summoned for having in his possession and deposited for the purpose of sale, 91 tins of liquid eggs, and one jar of the same stuff, weighing altogether about a ton. The eggs were unsound and unfit for human food. A large quantity of Boracic acid had been added in order to preserve them, but it had evidently been added after the eggs had turned bad. The defendant was sentenced at the Police Court to one month's imprisonment with hard labour, without the option of a fine. An appeal was lodged against this decision. By consent, the appeal was dismissed and the conviction upheld, but the sentence was altered to a fine of £50 with £10 10s Police Court costs, together with the whole of the costs incurred in the appeal. On February 1st, Mr. D. Eissen, of 36, Samuel Street, was summoned for having exposed for sale 41bs. of pears which were unfit for human consumptionHe was fined £1 and 2s. costs. On February 3rd, Mr. Abraham Siegleman, 79, Varden Street, was summoned for being in possession of 906 eggs which were unsound and unfit for human food and were deposited for the purpose of sale. The defendant was sentenced to one month's imprisonment with hard labour without the option of a fine. On June 6th, I received information that a cow had died at a dairy in White Horse Lane, and had been removed on the same day by a butcher from Jubilee Street. On visiting the dairy I was informed that the cow was quite dead before the arrival of the butcher's employees. I visited the latter's premises, where I was told that the cow in question had been removed to the Knacker's yard. Twelve cows had recently been killed on the premises, and thirteen had been skinned. I saw the skins in the slaughterhouse, as well as twelve sets of lungs, livers, &c. Five of the livers were diseased. They were 47 unfit for human food, and I had them taken to the Police Court, where they were condemned by the Magistrate. I visited the Knacker's yard, and examined the carcase that had been removed from the above premises. I found that it was the carcase of a cow that had been pole-axed and properly bled. It was, however, extensively tuberculous and very emaciated. It was the carcase of one of the twelve cows that had been killed the previous night, and was found to be so obviously extensively diseased as to be unfit for human food. On my return to the butcher's premises, the same tale was persisted in, until I told the owner that I had examined the carcase at the Knacker's yard, and that I could prove that it was not the one that had been removed from White Horse Lane. He then admitted that the carcase removed from White Horse Lane had been sent to the Meat Market to be sold. I immediately communicated with the City Authorities and tried to stop its being sold for human food, but failed to trace it. Pour days afterwards, the butcher told me that he had made another mistake; that he had not sent the carcase to the Meat Market at all, but to a butcher in Charterhouse Street. The carcase had been disposed of by this time, probably for making sausages. Proceedings were taken against the butcher for having deposited for sale on his premises five livers which were unsound and unfit for human food. The defence was that a certain tripe dresser contracted to buy all livers from the defendant. If any livers were delivered that were unfit for human food, they were either destroyed at our destructor, or sold as cats meat. The case was dismissed, because the Magistrate accepted the evidence that the livers would be destroyed by the tripe dresser, if they were not fit to eat, and only the sound livers would be paid for. The tripe dresser had bought livers from the defendant for several years, but on one occasion only did he have livers destroyed at our destructor. The slaughter-house license was objected to at the following annual licensing committee meeting. As the owner of the license had been cautioned three years previously, the London County Council refused to renew the license. The owner of the cowhouse license at White Horse Lane was also severely cautioned. On September 6th, a barrow load of plums was stopped for examination in Yalford Street. The owner immediately absconded, leaving the barrow and the plums in the custody of the Sanitary Inspector. The plums were found to be unsound, and unfit for human consumption, and were destroyed. 48 On September 9th, information was received that a number of frozen carcases of meat which were unsound and unwholesome, had been sold at the Meat Market and delivered to a shop in our district. The shop was visited and ten carcases were seized. They were taken to the Police Court and condemned by the Magistrate. The owner was present, but offered no objection to have them destroyed, and in fact, admitted that they were bad. 100 carcases had been bought by this butcher, but 90 had been delivered to a shop situated in another borough. Information was immediately sent to the officials of this borough, but the carcases had been returned to the vendors, and surrendered to the officials of the City Corporation, where they were destroyed. The cold air stores where the above carcases had been taken from, were inspected, and the rest of the consignment, consisting of 372 carcases, was seized, and ordered to be destroyed by the Magistrate at Clerkenwell Police Court. Police court proceedings were taken against Mr. Harris, of 132, Salmon Lane, for depositing for sale 10 carcases of mutton which were unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for human food. The defendant stated that he bought the sheep after inspecting samples at the cold air stores. He also proved to the satisfaction of the magistrate, that the carcases that he bought were not taken from the bulk where he had examined the samples. These 10 carcases had been delivered to Salmon Lane by mistake. They ought to have been taken to the other shop, where they would be placed in a cold air store, and each carcase would be thoroughly examined before it would be exposed for sale. The Magistrate accepted this explanation, and taking into consideration, that had there been no mistake in delivering them to the wrone shop, there would have been an opportunity for the carcases to be examined before they were exposed for sale. The summons was dismissed, but no costs were allowed. On October 14th Mr. Frederick Jensen, 67, Cable Street, was summoned for having in his possession and deposited for sale 255 tins of fruit, salmon, lobster, and tongues, which were unsound and unfit for human food. He was fined £10 and £3 3s. costs, or in default one month's imprisonment. On November 18th 1,382 large tins of preserved cherries, weighing about 7 tons, were seized on one of the wharves and conveyed to the Police Court. The owners appeared before the Magistrate, admitted they were unfit for human consumption, but desired the Magistrate to allow them to have the 49 cherries returned to the vendors in France, and to be there destroyed. This application was made to facilitate the return of the money paid for the cherries. The Magistrate refused to do this, and made an order to have them destroyed forthwith. On November 25th I seized 2 cwts. of beef in a shed at the rear of a house in Blakesley Street. This house was occupied by a butcher who had a stall in Watney Street. The meat was tuberculous, and was ordered to be destroyed by the Magistrate. As I had been invited to examine the carcase by the butcher, proceedings were taken against Mr. F. Clacee, Batcomb Lodge, Batcomb, Somersetshire, for offering for sale the above carcase. The amount to be paid for it was 14s. per cwt. of meat, without bones. The excuse of the defendant when the case was heard at the Police Court was ingenious. He thought that the butcher, when he interviewed him first at his stall, was selling cats' meat, and had offered this carcase for the same purpose. This statement was rendered more plausible from the fact that the defendant carried on a considerable trade in cats' meat. All the cats' meat, however, that he was in the habit of delivering, was boiled, previous to its being despatched by rail. This was done, because the railway authorities charged more for carrying raw than cooked meat. The price was more than twice as much as the market price of cats' meat for that date. The defendant was fined £15 15s. and £15 15s. costs. Three other seizures were made of jam, beef, pork, and bacon. The unsound food was condemned by the Magistrate, but after duly considering the facts of each case, it was decided by the Public Health Committee to take no further action in the matter, beyond cautioning the owners. The following unsound foods were destroyed during the year:— Apples 20 bushels, 679 barrels, 236 tins, 122 cases (tins). Anchovies 9 casks. Apricot Pulp 366 cases and 677 tins. Apricots (in tins) 5 cases and 64 tins. Blackberry Pulp 11 tins. Bacon 27¾ tons. Blackcurrants 27 half bushels. Beef 2 cwt. 2 qrs. Beef (canned) 745 cases and 3,052 tins. Bananas 3,479 crates.

The number of boats inspected in 1904 was 61, and the condition of the boats and their occupants as regards the matters dealt with in the Acts and Regulations was very good. Infringements of the Acts and Regulations were discovered as follows, viz : — (a) Registration Nil. (b) Notification of change of Master Nil. (c) Certificate 1 (d) Marking Nil. (e) Overcrowding Nil. (f) Separation of Sexes Nil. (g) Cleanliness Nil. (h) Ventilation Nil. (i) Painting Nil. (/') Provision of water cask Nil. (k) Removal of Bilge water Nil. (l) Notification of Infectious Diseases Nil. (m) Refusal to admit Inspector Nil. (n) Cabin roof not weatherproof 1 No legal proceedings were taken in respect of the infringements abovementioned. 53 No case of infectious disease occurred on Canal Boats in the district. One boat was detained for cleansing and disinfection. The number of boats on the Register on the 31st December, 1904, was 69. No boats were registered in 1904. On the 19th May, a letter was received from the Medical Officer of Health of Northampton, stating that a girl named Emma Maria Sidwell, was on the canal boat "Australia," Birmingham, No. 903, suffering from Erysipelas, and that the cargo was consigned to Messrs. W. Pearce & Sons, Bow Common. The boat arrived in this district on the 25th May, the girl had recovered, and the boat was disinfected. Houses Let in Lodgings. The bye-laws were revised during the year, and afterwards confirmed by the Local Government Board. Before a house is recommended to the Council to be registered, a notice is served on the keeper, requiring particulars of occupancy, rent, &c. This involves a great deal of time and trouble, and the particulars when received, are not of much value. About 5 per cent, only of the notices are filled in correctly. After notices have been served for the abatement of overcrowding, great difficulty is often encountered in obtaining access into the smaller houses, especially, when early morning visits are made, in order to find out whether the said notices have been complied with. Where rooms are sublet by a keeper, who does not reside on the premises, it is often very difficult to fix the responsibility on the proper person. This also frequently applies to owners, who can only be found after some trouble. The tenants are often unable to give the name or address of the person who collects the rent. If the rent-book be inspected, it is often found to be initialled only. It is impossible to say from these initials whether the collector is the owner, or is acting as agent. Since the new bye-laws have been in operation, a vast improvement has occurred in the houses, which is due to the action of the owners as well as of the tenants themselves. A higher standard of cleanliness has been established, and overcrowding has been lessened. Notices under the bye-laws were served, and overcrowding was abated in 614 registered houses. In only a few instances was it found necessary to take police court proceedings. 54 Revised By-laws for Houses let in Lodgings. 1.

" Keeper " in relation to a lodging-house means the person, whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest in the premises (whether he resides on the premises or not) by whom or on whose behalf the lodginghouse is let in lodgings, or for occupation by members of more than one family, or who for the time being receives or is entitled to receive the profits arising from the said letting. " Lodger " in relation to a lodging-house means a person to whom any room or rooms in the lodging-house may have been let as a lodging or for his use and occupation, or who, not being a member of the family of such person, may occupy or use any such room or rooms by permission of the person to whom the same may be let. 2.

Subject to the provisions of these by-laws the landlord of a lodginghouse shall cause every drain or means of drainage, with which any watercloset belonging to the lodging-house may communicate, to be maintained at all times in good order and efficient action. He shall also cause all such means of ventilation as are provided in or in connection therewith to be maintained at all times in good order. 9. Every landlord, or keeper in a lodging-house who occupies or resides in any part of the premises and every lodger in a lodgmg-house shall cause all solid or liquid filth or refuse to be removed once at least in every day from every room which is occupied by him, and shall once at least in every day cause every vessel, utensil, or other receptacle for the said filth or refuse to be thoroughly cleansed; and every keeper of a lodging-house shall once at least in every day similarly remove or cause to be removed all solid or liquid filth or refuse from all other parts of the lodging-house not specifically mentioned in this by-law. 10.

Provided tnat the foregoing requirement with respect to lime-washing shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such ceiling or wall is painted, or where the material of or with which that surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing tnereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where the said surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 15.

On January 29th, Mr. Canncn, of Mottingham, Kent, was fined £3 and £2 2s. costs for baking in an underground bakehouse at 278, Cable Street, without first receiving the necessary certificate from the Borough Council. 78 On February 26th, Mr. Aaron Woolf, of 89, Sidney Street, was fined £5 and £2 4s. costs for using an underground bakehouse which had not been certified by the Council. Model Dwellings. The so-called model dwellings were carefully inspected during the year, and the number of persons occupying them was taken, together with their ages. This action was done for several reasons. One object was to find out whether they were overcrowded, and the other to obtain the figures necessary to compare their relative healthiness with the rest of the borough. There are in the district 104 groups of models, with a population of 26,089. The population is distributed as follows:— Under 1 year of age - - 1,034. Between 1 and 5 years of age - 3,700. Between 5 and 20 years of age - 9,077. Between 20 and 40 years of age - 8,310. Between 40 and 60 years of age - 3,341. Above 60 years of age 627. The number of births was 1,007, which corresponds to a birth rate of 38'5 per 1,000. It is therefore slightly higher than the general birth rate of the Borough. The four hundred and two deaths that occurred in these buildings during the year were distributed as follows :— Under 1 year of age - 142 Between 1 and 5 years of age - 87 Between 5 and 15 years of age - 14 Between 15 and 25 years of age- 13 Between 25 and 65 years of age - 107 Above 65 years of age - 39 402 79 18 per cent of the population in the models were children under 5 years of age, whereas the proportion in the whole of the Borough was about 13 per cent. It must therefore be at once conceded that the age distribution in the former is less favourable to a low death rate than in the latter. The larger the number of children under 5, the higher should be the death rate. The death rate however was only 15-3 per 1,000 compared with 19'5 throughout the whole district. The Infantile Mortality was 141 per 1,000 births, which is less by nearly 18 per 1,000 than in the whole Borough. Notifiable Diseases. 202 notifications were received, which is equivalent to a rate of 7'73 per 1,000. The rate in the whole district was 8'64 per 1000 of the population. The whole of the Borough. Models. Notifications. Deaths. Notifications. Deaths. Per 1.000. Per 1,000. Per 1.000. Per 1,000. Scarlet Fever 3.8 0.10 4.1 0.07 Diphtheria 2.38 0.29 2.1 0.19 Small Pox 0.26 0.009 0.19 nil Erysipelas 1.50 0.06 1.18 nil Enteric Fever 0.60 0.09 0.15 0.03 There were 24 notifications of Croup, Typhus Fever and Puerperal Fever in the district, but none in the models. It will be seen that with the exception of Scarlet Fever the notifiable diseases were less prevalent as well as less fatal. Even Scarlet Fever, which was more prevalent, was less fatal than throughout the whole district. When we come to the other infectious diseases that are not notifiable, and therefore treated at home, we find the death rate very much higher in the models. Thus, the death rate from Measles was 1.31 per 1,000, as compared with 0.57 in the whole Borough. The death rate from Whooping Cough in the models was 0.57 per 1,000, as compared with 0.43 per 1,000. The death rate from Diarrhœa and Enteritis was 0.31 per 1,000 less in the model dwellings, than in the whole Borough. Phthisis was also far less fatal in the models, being 1.41 per 1000, as compared with 2.26. If we compare the death rate from Phthisis combined with the other tubercular diseases, we find that it is 1.76 per 1,000 in the models, and 2.84 in the whole Borough. 80 The death rate from Inflammatory Affections of the Lungs is less by 0-51 per 1,000 in the models. The fatal accidents among children under five is, as might be expected, slightly higher in model dwellings. Factory and Workshops Act. The number of workshops in the district vary from time to time. During the Inspectors' visits they come across rooms that have been converted into workshops, without the owners having taken the trouble of applying to the Home Office for an abstract of the Act for the purpose of posting it up. A few months afterwards probably the owner removes to another place. It is impossible therefore to keep a correct list of the workshops with the number of people employed therein. Cleanliness.—Most of the workshops were cleansed at the proper period, but some were found in such a condition as to require cleansing, and 545 notices were sent for this purpose. Ventilation.—Ventilation was improved and effluvium nuisances were abated as the result of serving 75 notices. Overcrowding.—As stated above, overcrowding was abated in 51 workshops. Water closet accommodation.—Additional water closet accommodation was provided in 104 workshops. 81 TABLES FOR THE HOME OFFICE.
