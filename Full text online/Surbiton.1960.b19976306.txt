INTRODUCTION BY THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH Telephone No; PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, Elmbridge 6441-8. Ext. 25- 2, SHALSTON VILLAS, SURBITON. June 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Surbiton. Annual Report, 1960. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the Annual Report on the Public Health and Social conditions of the Borough for 1960. The Report is compiled in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular No. 1/61, dated 31st January, 1961, and follows the general lines as for previous years. I am pleased to report that the health of Surbiton still remains very satisfactory, and there have been no outbreaks of infectious disease. Population: 'The population of Surbiton on which the vital statistics are based is now 64,100, an increase on last year's figure of 350. Infectious diseases: The number of infectious disease notifications received in I960 was 118 compared with 1,337 for 1959. This decrease is due to the greatly reduced number of cases of measles. Also, there were only two cases of dysentery, and I am certain that this is attributable to the constant alertness and co-operation with the department of the medical practitioners. Notificatiohs of scarlet fever fell from 30 in 1959 to 24 in I960, whilst whooping cough notifications showed an increase of 30. This increase is much regretted as immunisation against whooping cough is available to all children and can conveniently be given by the use of triple antigen giving protection against "Diphtheria", "Tetanus" and "whooping Cough". Such a variety of protection against disease is now available for children that the normal sequence in the early years of life tends to bes- REC0LL1ENDED PROTECTION AT AGE Vaccination against SMALLPOX 2 months First injection )against DIPHTHERIA, 3 months Second injection )WHOOPING COUGH and 4 months Third injection )TETANUS - 'Triple' 5 months First injection ) 6 months Second injection )against POLIOMYELITIS 7 months Third injection ) 13-14 months Booster injection)against DIPHTHERIA, 15-18 months )WHOOPING COUGH and and Booster injection)TETANUS - 'Triple' 4-5 years. Booster injection against DIPHTHERIA 8-11 years. or some variation of this programme according to circumstances. 2. In previous reports I have specifically mentioned the absence of Diphtheria in the Borough since 1946, and I am verypleased to say that for the third year in succession we have had no case of Poliomyelitis in Surbiton. I would like to acknowledge the great help given to us by the general medical practitioners in carrying out an intensive and persistent programme of active immunisation among children and adults. There has been steady progress towards keeping up all-round high standards of food hygiene. Birthss The number of live births for 1960 is 921 and compares with 853 for 1959. The birth rate is 14.36 per 1,000 of the population compared with 13.38 for the previous year. Deaths: The number of deaths recorded in 1960 is 675 compared with 615 for 1959. This gives a death rate of 10.53 per thousand of the population compared with 9.64 for 1959. The number of deaths of infants under one year in 1960 is 16 giving an Infant Mortality Rate of 17.37 compared with a rate of 17.58 for 1959. The causes of death of these infants will be seen on page 10. Causes of death: The main causes of death during 1960 were:- Heart and circulatory disease 249 Cancer 134 Vascular lesions of Nervous System 87 In view of the attention given to the relationship between smoking and lung cancer the relevant figures for Surbiton residents is given belows- 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 M F M F M F M F M F M F Deaths from cancer of the lung and bronchus 21 2 24 6 19 4 26 3 22 4 34 1 Total 23 30 23 29 26 35 Housing; Housing still remains an urgent and demanding responsibility for the Council. The activity of recent years by private developers continues and the remarks made in my letter of last year still apply. The new housing units will require to be grouped in blocks of higher buildings and greater densities to allow the inclusion of more household amenities such as adequate refuse incineration arrangements particularly in modern dwellings with no solid fuel burning fireplaces. 3. I Staff: Details of the staff of the Public Health Department are set out on page 1. There was one change during the year. Mr. A.G. Babbage qualified by examination as a Public Health Inspector and left the Council's service on the 4th October, 1960, to take up an appointment with Hayes & Harlington Urban District Council. The post remained vacant at the end of the year. I am pleased again to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement throughout the year, and to Mr. Eldridge, the Chief Public Health Inspector and his Inspectors, to Mr. Elms and the clerical staff, and to Dr. W.H. Kinstrie, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. I have the honour to be,Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J.W. STARKEY Medical Officer of Health. 4.

Sickness benefit, contacts or carriers of infectious disease Under the National Insurance Act, 1946, sickness benefit will, in certain circumstances, be payable to persons who are deemed to be incapable of work through being contacts or carriers, although not actually ill themselves. Only exceptionally is it necessary to require contacts or carriers of infectious disease to stay away from work, and then only in the case of more serious infections. The Medical Officer of Health may issue a certificate where there is a special risk saying such a person should absent himself from his employment for a time; and it is in such circumstances that the right to draw sickness benefit is occasioned. Benefit will only be paid on the production of a certificate by a Medical Officer of Health that the person is under medical observation by reason of being a carrier of infectious disease, or has been in contact with a case of infectious disease (as the case may be) in circumstances which make it advisable to exclude him from work. This Act applies particularly to food handlers, e.g. persons employed in cafes, canteens and restaurants. During the year one such certificate was issued. DIPHTHERIA. The Borough has now been free from cases of diphtheria since 1946, and if parents will continue to take advantage of the immunisation service offered, there is no reason why the disease should not be entirely stamped out. The responsibility for providing this service rests with the County Council by virtue of section 26 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the Medical Officer of Health, who is also the Divisional Medical Officer for the County Council, organises the service within the Borough. Administrative work on immunisation is conducted in the ' Public' Health Department on behalf of the County Council for which 35% of a clerk's salary is reimbursed. Arrangements also exist with general medical practitioners to carry out diphtheria, whooping cough immunisation and other immunisation. A doctor taking part is expected to send records to the Authority of the immunisation carried out in. the course of his practice; the Authority provides the record cards and pays a fee to the doctor for each completed card received. Doctors are able to collect prophylactic material from the Public Health Department or from Grange Road Health Centre, Kingstonupon-Thames. Diphtheria Immunisation Clinics are held at:- Gosbury Hill Clinic, Monday mornings at 1, Gosbury Hill, Hook. 9.30 to 11 o'clock. Telephones Elmbridge 5737. South Place Clinic, Monday mornings at Ewell Road, Surbiton. 11 o'clock. Telephones Elmbridge 4897. (or Diphtheria Immunisation may be carried out by patient's own doctor, as described above). 13 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION The number of immunisations carried out during the year was as follows:- Age Group Primary Immunisations during 1960.

SMALLPOX Whilst this disease only appears in this country at rare intervals it is still prevalent in many parts of the world and its introduction here is an ever-present threat. Its seriousness is such that the simple precaution of vaccination ought not to be neglected even though it is no longer compulsory for infants to be vaccinated. Patients of all ages can be vaccinated by their own doctors, whilst children are also dealt with at the Clinics under the control of the Surrey County Council. Calf-lymph for vaccination is obtainable from the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale. 15 The number of persons who were vaccinated or re-vaccinated during I960 was:- Age Groups Under 1 1 2-4 5-14 15 or over. TOTAL Vaccinations 567 66 19 20 70 742 Re-vaccinations - - 7 24 308 339 Calculations show that by the end of 1960 some 61.567% of children born between 1st July, 1959 and 30th June, 1960, have been vaccinated against smallpox. SONNE DYSENTERY. The number of cases reported during the year was 2 against 123 for the previous year. The following table shows the number of cases occurring since first recognition of this disease in Surbiton in 1950:- 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 140 62 - 10 12 25 289 202 28 123 2 Personal hygiene is of the utmost importance in prevention of spread, especially the washing of hands after use of water-closets and before eating. W.C.s should be kept scrupulously clean, seats, chain-pulls and door handles in particular being frequently washed with disinfectant. Schools are naturally associated with the dissemination of the illness, but without doubt it also spreads rapidly through households once introduced. It is therefore regarded as a "family" illness necessitating checking of all contacts. This is readily done in the laboratory by examination of faeces, but the task of controlling an outbreak is a major operation calling for close co-operation between laboratory, medical practitioners, teachers, parents and Public Health Department staff. The greatest chance of success comes when no time is lost in recognising the condition and notifying it to the Public Health Department so that preventive action can be initiated without delay. 16 POLIOMYELITIS. No case has been reported since 1958, and figures since 1949 are given below:- Years 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958-60 Cases: 5 8 1 2 3 2 8 1 6 - Deaths 2 1 - 1 - - - - - Arrangements are made whereby doctors may collect anti-poliomyelitis vaccine from the Public Health Department, and this facility is very much appreciated and used. At the end of the year good progress has been made towards the protection by vaccination of the priority groups for which vaccine had been issued by the Ministry of Health. These groups were:- All persons who have not at the time of their application for vaccination reached the age of forty. General practitioners. Ambulance staff. Hospital staff who come into contact with patients. Medical students. Practising dental surgeons, dental students, dental hygienists, student hygienists and dental surgeons' chairside assistants. Practising nurses not working in hospitals. Public Health staff who may come into contact with poliomyelitis cases. The families of the above groups. Expectant mothers who are particularly urged to be vaccinated as early as possible in pregnancy and such requests are dealt with as priorities. Persons going to visit or reside in a country outside Europe, other than Canada or the United States of America. Vaccination consists of one simple initial injection given into the arm followed approximately four weeks later by a second, and after a period of seven months by a third, and about one year later a fourth will be called for. This is known to give a workable level of protection in most subjects for several years. 17 POOD POISONING. There were eight confirmed cases notified by general practitioners; the causative organisms were identified as shown below:- S. Typhi-murium 5 cases S. Senftenberg 1 case CI. Welchii 2 cases. The ages of the eight persons were as follows Adults 4 18 years 1 13 " 1 3 " 1 1.10/12 years 1 Two cases occurred in each of two families whilst the other four were individual cases. LABORATORY FACILITIES. Extensive use is made of the facilities provided by the Public Health Laboratory Service (directed by the Medical Research Council for the Ministry of Health); and opportunity is taken to gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Doctor D.M. Stone and her staff at the Epsom Laboratory to which our specimens are taken. Apart from routine samples of water, milk, ice-cream and other food (details of which are given under other headings) the undermentioned specimens were collected by the Inspectors in the course of investigating cases of dysentery, paratyphoid, food poisoning, etc. and taken to the Laboratory.

At the commencement of the year there were 301 cases of tuberculosis on the register and at the end of the year this figure had decreased to 259, the lowest figure for the last ten years. During the year 57 were notified as recovered from the disease; 21 left the district; there were 7 deaths and 5 were found to be non-tubercular. Last year I reported that the figure of 301 cases remaining on the register at the end of 1959 was the lowest for the previous ten years. It will be seen that the figure of 259 at the end of 1960 is even a much larger reduction, and that during the period under review 57 cases were removed from the register by reason of being 'recovered'. 19 Cases added to Register during year.

It was not necessary to take any action under these Regulations during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACT, 1936, Section 172. No action was taken under this Section. 20 MASS radiography. No visit was made by the Mass X-ray Unit to the Borough during 1960. However, persons requiring chest x-ray may attend by appointment at the Chest Clinic, 27, Queen's Road, Kingston Hill, Telephone No. Kingston 6251, at the following times:- Mondays at 9.30 a.m. Tuesdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2.0 p.m. Wednesdays at 2.0 p.m. Thursdays at 9.30 a.m. and 2.0 p.m. Fridays at 9.30 a.m. Kingston & District Tuberculosis Care Committee This is a local voluntary Committee which raises funds and gives help to families with tuberculosis and other.chest diseases. It works witn the Surrey County Council Official services and is formed from representatives of the four District Councils in the North Central Division together with other interested persons. The Town Council appoints two representatives annually and the present representatives are:- Alderman Mrs. a. Woodgate, J.P. Councillor J.R. .ashton, J.P. During the year 1960 an amount of £1,538 was spent on giving help to 98 families of which 27 were Surbiton families. medical examinations. During the year eighty-seven persons were medically examined for the Council in connection with the Superannuation Fund and the Sick Pay Scheme, as shown below:- Superannuation Fund Sick Pay Scheme Special Examinations 42 41 4 welfare of old people There is in the Borough much voluntary activity devoted to this cause such as provision of weekly clubs, daily centre, arranging seaside holidays, distribution of Christmas gifts and visiting of house-bound. 21 WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE (CONTD.) The work is co-ordinated through the Surbiton Old People's Welfare Committee, a voluntary body representative of most walks of life and presided over by His Worship the Mayor. The Town Council leases to the Committee a large house which, after extensive works of repair and re-decoration, was opened in September 1958 as a Centre for old people, including clubrooms, recreation rooms, handicraft room, chiropody clinic and canteen. The chiropody service is now being conducted on behalf of the County Council. A meals on wheels service is operated by the Surbiton Division of the British Red Cross Society, and the Council makes a generous contribution towards the cost involved. The number of subsidised mid-day meals distributed during the year was 4,374. The Borough Council has provided ninety-four special flats for aged people, and a further twelve are under construction. There can be no exaggeration of the importance of this work for the old people, or of its increasing urgency as year succeeds year and more survive to the older age groups. It is now imperative that the contributions in money and services by the Local Authorities, i.e. County and Borough be extended and continuous co-ordination be exerted over all the field of work. CO-ORDINATION OF HEALTH AND OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES. In 1957 a committee of the Council was formed to consider and report upon methods of co-operation between the Town Council and other bodies concerned with the health and other social services within the Borough, to assist if required in the co-ordination of such work, and to examine ways of encouraging recruitment of more voluntary workers. The need for such work was indicated by the consideration of the Housing Committee of the previously published report of the Working Party of the Surrey County Council on the Prevention of Break-up of Families. The Committee, and its sub-Committees, have had several meetings and discussions with representatives of organisations in the Borough, and concluded that there is a need for a closer link between such organisations and the Council. During the year meetings of Field Social Workers in Chessington Area were held. There appeared to be a desire for all social workers to meet informally, and to establish contact with each other beyond the telephone. The meetings proved to be very helpful to all concerned. 22 NURSING IN THE HOME (District Nursing). The Headquarters of the District Nursing Association is at 21-23, Upper Brighton Road (Telephone No. Elmbridge 3027) where application should be made for the services of a district nurse or midwife. Such applications have to be supported by the family doctor under whose direction all home nursing is given. The District Nursing Services are administered by the Surrey County Council through the Divisional Medical Officer of Health who is also Medical Officer of Health for Surbiton. ANTE-NATAL CLINICS. The ante-natal clinic can serve as the focal point of all activities relating to the expectant and nursing mother. The health visitor from the ante-natal clinic follows up cases at home for the purpose of advising and helping the expectant mother in all matters relating to pregnancy. Mothers are also encouraged to attend these clinics after their confinement to make sure that full health and normality is restored. This service is additional and designed to supplement that which an expectant mother is entitled to receive from a general practitioner and midwife. HOME HELP SERVICE. Persons desiring to avail themselves of this service should apply, supporting their application with a medical certificate, to the Divisional Medical Officer, The Health Centre, Grange Road, Kingston-upon-Thames, who will arrange for the Divisional Home Help Supervisor to visit and investigate the application. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the water supply for the Borough comes from the Metropolitan Water Board and is satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. All premises have a direct mains supply and there are no wells or standpipes in use. Monthly reports are supplied by the Board giving details of their chemical and bacteriological examinations. This dependable first class water supply is a tremendous factor in maintaining the good health of the people of Surbiton. RIVERS AND STREAMS. The Hogsmill River is the Borough boundary for some two miles on the eastern side. Now that sewage effluent from Epsom is no longer discharged into it, it has become a clean stream again and small fish which have been absent for many years have re-appeared. The River Thames is the northern boundary and whilst there is no bathing a pleasant riverside promenade gives much pleasure to many people and boating and yachting are popular pastimes. The island known as Ravens Ait belongs to the Navy League and Sea Cadet Corps and is used as a national boat training station for sea cadets. 23. SWIMMING BATH. Publicly owned bath. Surbiton Lagoon, situated in Raeburn Avenue, is an open air pool 165 feet long and 90 feet wide, with a depth of three to nine feet. There is also a paddling pool for small children. The water is from Metropolitan Water Board mains and is treated by continuous pressure sand filtration, sterilisation by breakpoint chlorination and oxygenation over an ornamental cascade. Periodical samples of water are taken by the Borough Engineer and the plant adjusted as necessary. In addition twenty-four samples were taken by the Public Health Department for chemical and bacteriological examination all of which proved to be satisfactory. School bath. One private school has a small swimming bath which is used only by scholars and staff. Sterilisation is by hand dosing with chlorine with changes of water as necessary. Pour samples were taken by the Public Health Department to ensure adequate chlorination and fitness for bathing, all of which proved to be satisfactory. REFUSE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL. Refuse and salvage collection is under the control of the Borough Engineer. The collection was maintained at seven day intervals except when interfered with by holidays and sickness. The refuse is transported to a central loading depot in the Royal Borough of Kingston-upon-Thames, transferred to large haulage wagons and then moved under contract for disposal into privately owned pits. SEWERAGE There are very few cesspools remaining, nearly all properties in the Borough being now connected to the public sewerage system. A little trouble is being experienced in the Hook area with the sewers which are proving inadequate to deal with the many new properties connected to them, and a new relief sewer is to be constructed by the Council along the Hook Road at an early date. Flooding during times of heavy rainfall is also occurring in several parts of the Borough and sundry remedial works are being put in hand including a new surface water sewer in the Tolworth area. 24.

NOTES: (i) Further details will "be found tinder headings "Food Hygiene", "Factories", etc. (ii) No works carried out as a consequence of action under the Rent Act and Improvement Grant Scheme are included above. IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. The Council continued to operate this scheme in cases (a) where new housing accommodation would be provided by the conversion of an existing building, (b) where additional accommodation was to be provided by adding rooms, and (c) where it was intended to improve the sanitary arrangements and/or the system of water heating. These grants are now known as "Discretionary Grants" and are paid solely at the discretion of the local authority with a maximum of £400. per dwelling. Four applications for Discretionary Grants were received, two were approved, one withdrawn, and one not recommended. On the 14th June, 1959, The House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959, came into force and required local authorities to make grants towards the cost of providing "standard amenities" in dwellings; and made certain amendments to the existing provisions relating to improvement grants. The standard amenities are (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a washhand basin; (c) a hot water supply; (d) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. The amount of the "standard grant" which, subject to certain conditions, can be claimed as of right is one half of the cost of the approved works, subject to a maximum of £155. This limit of £155 is reduced as follows in respect of amenities which already exist Amenity: Reduction: £ Fixed bath or shower in a bathroom 25 Washhand basin 5 Hot water supply 75 Water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling 40 Satisfactory food store 10 Forty-four standard grant applications were received, 41 were approved, 2 withdrawn, and 1 not recommended.

RENT ACT. 1957. This Act, together with its accompanying Regulations has been in operation since 6th July, 1957. The Council has delegated to the Public Health Committee its powers relating to Certificates of Disrepair, and this materially helps in dealing with applications in an expeditious manner which is so important in common fairness to the parties concerned. The position up to the end of the year is shown in the following summary:- 6th July to 31st Dec. 1957 1958 1959 1960 (1) No. of applications for Certificates of Disrepair ( Form I ) 61 56 25 5 (2) No. of Decisions not to issue Certificates 3 1 1 Nil (3) No. of decisions to issue Certificates (a) in respect of some but not all defects listed by tenants. 40 36 16 5 (b) in respect of defects listed 12 13 8 Nil (4) No. of undertakings to remedy defects given by landlords under paragraph 5 of the First Schedule (Form K) 27 34 19 4 (5) No. of such undertakings refused by Council Nil Nil Nil Nil (6) No. of notices of proposal to issue a Certificate of Disrepair served (Form J.) 52 57 25 5 (7) No. of Certificates of Disrepair issued (Form L) 10 32 5 1 (8) No. of applications by tenants under consideration at the end of the year (Form I) 6 1 Nil Nil (9) Applications by landlords to Local Authority for cancellation of Certificates (Form M) Nil 16 9 3 (10) Objections by tenants to cancellation of Certificates Nil 9 1 3 (11)Decisions by Local Authority to cancel in spite of tenants' objections Nil 2 Nil Nil (12)Certificates cancelled by Local Authority Nil 13 9 2 (13)Refusals to cancel Certificates of Disrepair Nil 2 Nil 1 (14) Certificates as to remedying of defects Specified in landlord's undertaking (Form P) Nil 19 19 7 Dealing with applications by tenants and landlords has brought its problems, but despite the complications involved, it can be said that there have been no serious troubles and, so far no appeals in which the Council has been concerned. There can be no doubt that a great deal of repair and redecoration of houses has taken place as a result of the Act much of it without recourse to the Council. 33. FOOD INSPECTION. Foodstuffs of all descriptions are constantly under inspection to see that they are fit for human consumption. During the year a variety of foods which were not fit were surrendered "by the owners and destroyed by burning or burying. The total weight of such goods was :18 cwts: 1 qr: 3 lbs: 3 ozs. There is no slaughterhouse in use in the Borough consequently no meat inspection is carried out except in butchers' shops. Forty samples of various kinds of food were taken for bacteriological examination as a routine measure to check on fitness for human consumption. FOOD HYGIENE. Forty-one premises are registered under section 16 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955, for the preparation or manufacture of sausages, or potted, pressed, pickled or preserved foods intended for sale, and 20 premises for the preparation of preserved food intended for sale for human consumption (including the preparation of fish by any process of cooking and the cooking of poultry). 1,119 visits were made to these premises and to shops, canteens, restaurants, public houses, food handling businesses, and vehicles to ensure the maintenance of a proper standard of hygiene and to examine food intended for sale. The following works were carried out to meet the requirements of the Food & Drugs Act, byelaws and other legislation :- Protection of food from contamination 15 Protective clothing provided for assistants 2 Hot water supply provided for washing 9 Sinks and basins provided 11 Waste pipes repaired or renewed 4 Floors repaired, renewed or cleansed 14 Service pipes and cisterns repaired, etc. 1 Internal walls and ceilings repaired 7 Food rooms cleansed 57 Renewal or cleansing of equipment 2 W.Cs. cleansed, repaired or new pans fixed 17 W.Cs. lighted or ventilated 3 Additional drains provided 2 Drains cleansed or repaired 2 Dust receptacles provided 5 Accumulations removed 9 Windows repaired or renewed 2 Doors repaired or renewed 1 Rooms ventilated 3 Name and address displayed on vehicle 6 Miscellaneous 5 Whilst the standard of hygiene has been maintained at a reasonably satisfactory level, it is a subject which calls for constant attention by the Inspectors. 34.

Examination of "blue wrappers in which apples were packed showed that paper was impregnated With about 10% of a mineral oil. The treatment of papers with mineral oil is not uncommon but it requires a high quality odourless oil. In this case it would appear likely that either an oil of unsuitable quality had been used or that further oily contamination had occurred during transit or storage. Remainder of apples returned to wholesalers by retailer. The matter was referred to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. 2250 (informal (Confectionery - flour cream horns) Contained a substance Which resembled cream in appearance but which consisted of imitation cream. Attention of retailer drawn to misleading description on his price ticket which was duly altered. 38. 2274 (informal) (Sausages- pork) FOOD & DRUGS (Cont.) Contained Sulphur dioxide 340 p.p.m. which was not declared. The sausages were made by a local butcher who does not use preservative. Samples of ingredients and further samples of the sausages failed to reveal any preservative. 2270 (informal) 2277 (formal) (Confectionery- chocolate, Cherry Brandy Likor Flip2 samples). These articles simulated liqueur chocolates in outward appearance, but consisted of small chocolate bottles containing a pink paste inside. This paste contained only 7.2% of proof spirit and had been prepared with sugar and a little spirit of some kind and was artificially coloured and flavoured. Cherry Brandy contains 40% or more of proof spirit and from the description of this article as Likor Flip, the Public Analyst says he would expect the chocolate casing to contain fluid contents including a high proportion of cherry brandy and that the alcohol content would amount to 25 per cent or more of proof spirit. The matter was taken up with the manufacturers who eventually produced labels which they said were issued to retailers but which were not in fact displayed in the shop where the purchases were made. Had they been exhibited they would have given a clearer description of the article than the words printed on the individual imitation bottles. Advice was given to the manufacturers both as to labelling and in connection with possible deterioration with the passage of time. 2278 (informal) (Chocolate Liqueurs) This article was one of imitation liqueur chocolates, the liquid centres of which consisted of a non-spirituous flavoured syrup. As a result of investigation we were satisfied that the article was not intended to be sold as real chocolate liqueurs; the retailer had not displayed the price ticket (since produced) which describes them as "Chocolate Filled Bottles(6 Liqueur Flavours)" which is a more accurate description but not quite in accordance with the views of the Ministry of Food, The importers undertook to use a more suitable description for future consignments. 39. 2280 (informal) (Assorted Liqueur Chocolates) FOOD & DRUGS (Cont). Consisted of liqueur chocolates containing spirituous centres consisting of a mixture of about one half genuine liqueurs and one half syrup. This article was described on the top of the box container as "Assorted Liqueur Chocolates Genuine Liqueur Centres", but the latter part of this description was not strictly true. The Public Analyst accepted these chocolates as genuine and of excellent quality but felt bound to take exception to the additional words on the label "Genuine Liqueur Centres" which he regarded as meaning that the centres consisted of genuine liqueurs as such. In fact, a proportion of syrup in some form or another is essential in the manufacture of these centres and the words are not therefore strictly accurate. After some correspondence the manufacturers agreed that they would omit the three words altogether from future productions so that there could be no possibility of purchasers being misled in any way by the description. 2317 (informal) (Sausages - pork) Contained preservative Sulphur Dioxide 270 p.p.m. which was not declared. It was subsequently found that a "preservative" notice was exhibited in the shop but it had become obscured. Request for more conspicuous display was duly complied with. 2330 (informal) (Sardinesin Olive Oil) Contained 2.1% of added salt which was not declared on the label. Company concerned stated that this purchase must have been from old stock and they undertook to check stock in all their stores and remove from sale any found to be improperly labelled. 2337 (informal) (Sardines in Olive Oil) Contained 1.0% of added salt which was not declared on the label. Assurance received from importers that current stocks are labelled "with added salt". The sample must have been a can printed some years ago. 2361 (informal) (Brisling in Olive Oil' Contained 1.7% of added salt v/hich was not specified on the label. The matter was taken up with the packers who stated that in 1959 they only packed a small quantity of brisling and none during 1960. They had overlooked the necessity to declare the presence of salt but any new labels would be correctly worded if they re-commenced packing. 40. FOOD & DRUGS (Cont). 2369 (informal) Contained 1.2% of added salt which was (Sardines in pure olive oil) not specified on the label. The matter was taken up with the importers who stated that they had already had their attention drawn to the omission and current labels ( a copy of which was sent) were correctly worded. FOOD & DRUGS ACT, 1955. Foreign bodies in food. (i) Bread. A resident complained about a mouse dropping found in a loaf of bread which had been purchased at a shop in the Borough. The observations of the manufacturer were submitted, and the Council decided that legal proceedings be instituted under section 2 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. The Justices convicted the manufacturer, imposed a fine of £25. and awarded the Council £7.15.0. costs. (ii) Steak and Kidney Pie. A resident complained that a steak and kidney pie which she had purchased from a trader's van was sour. The observations of the manufacturer and the retailer were submitted, and the Council decided that a warning letter be sent to the retailer. (iii) Macaroni. A resident complained about a purchase of macaroni found to be affected by mould. The observations of the Company concerned were submitted, and the Council decided to send them a warning letter. (iv) Small Bloomer loaf. A resident complained about a small bloomer loaf which contained what appeared to be a piece of dirty cellulose film. The observations of the manufacturer/retailers were submitted. The Council decided that legal proceedings be instituted against them under section 2 of the Food & Drugs Act, 1955. The Justices convicted, imposing a fine of £15- and awarding the Council 10 guineas costs. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACTS. The parts of these Acts for which the Council is responsible relate to false trade descriptions of articles of food and to the marking of certain imported foodstuffs with an indication of the country of origin. There is a tendency for the requirements of these Acts and the Marking Orders made thereunder to be 'overlooked' necessitating constant reminders to traders of their obligation. Eight contraventions were observed during the year and a caution given in each case. MILK SUPPLY. (i) At the end of the year there were forty-six entries on the register as follows Distributors of milk (premises in the Borough) 30 Distributors of milk with premises outside the Borough but retailing in the Borough 9 Premises registered (used as Dairies) 7 41. MILK SUPPLY (Cont.) (ii) Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations 1949 - 1954. Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 - 1 953. Dealers licences to sell designated milk were granted as follows:- Pasteurised milk 31 " " (supplementary) 9 Tuberculin Tested milk 22 " " " (supplementary) 8 Sterilised milk 18 (supplementary) 8 (iii) Eighty-six samples of milk were taken during the year and submitted to the following tests Turbidity Test T.B. Biological Test Methylene Blue Test Phosphatase Test T.T. (C.I.)(Farm Bottled) - 3 5 - Pasteurised - - 35 35 T.T. Pasteurised - - 26 26 Sterilised 6 - - - T.T.(Raw Milk) - 11 - - The phosphatase test indicates that pasteurisation has been properly carried out; the methylene blue test is used to determine cleanliness and keeping quality; the turbidity test is a check on sterilisation and the T.B. test is for the purpose of detecting tubercle bacilli. The T.T. (Raw Milk) samples for T.B. test were taken at farms in the Borough. All samples conformed to the required standard with the exception of one T.T. (Farm Bottled), which failed the methylene blue test. This was taken up with the retailing company so that they could get in touch with their suppliers. A subsequent sample proved satisfactory. Very little of this grade of milk is now sold here. Milk & Dairies (General) Regulations. 1959 ~ Dirty Milk Bottle: A complaint was made by a local resident concerning the dirty condition of a milk bottle delivered to his house. The observations j of the suppliers were submitted. The Council decided to send them a warning letter. 42. ICE CREAM. (i) Registration: 159 premises are registered by the Council under Section 16, Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, as under:- For manufacture, storage and sale 3 For manufacture, storage and sale "but manufacture to "be limited to icedlollies 5 For storage and sale but not manufac ture 151 (ii) Samples: 72 samples were taken, details being as follows:Ice Cream. Grade 1 69 98.57% 100% Grade 2 1 1.43% Grade 3 Nil Grade 4 Nil 70 i Iced Lollies. Grade 1 2 72 100% The Public Health Laboratory Service advised that owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results on any single sample. Judgement should he based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested that over a six monthly period, 50% of a vendor's samples should fall into grade 1, 80% into grades 1 or 2, not more than 20% into grade 3, and none into grade 4. The results above show that a very high standard of hygienic quality is being maintained both by manufacturers and retailers. There is now no ice-cream manufactured within the Borough. CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956. The Council gave further consideration to the provisions of this Act and its complementary orders and regulations, particularly the procedure for making smoke control orders. The following resolutions of the Public Health Committee were confirmed by the Council:- (i) That the decision contained in minute 463 (k) (i) be re-affirmed, namely that this Committee are entirely in sympathy with the object of the Clean Air Act, 1956, to abate the pollution of the air; that in present circumstances, particularly the shortage of smokeless fuels, they do not consider that they are justified in recommending formal action to create smoke control areas within the borough, but that the matter be kept under review, and the burgesses encouraged voluntarily to adopt the use of smokeless fuels and adapt their existing fireplaces where necessary; (ii) That the Ministry of Housing and Local Government be informed of the decision in (i) above, and asked whether there is any likelihood of an increase in the supplies of smokeless fuels in the near future. 43. CLEAN AIR ACT,1956. (Cont.). The Ministry replied inviting the Town Council to reconsider their decision as they understood from the Ministry of Fuel and Power that supplies of suitable quality open fire solid smokeless fuel should be available to meet the local smoke con??? needs although some reliance might have to be placed on open fire gas coke as there was no guarantee that particular types of fuel would always be available to householders who preferred them. After consideration of this letter the following resolution was passed (i) That having given due consideration to the reply from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Committee recommend that the Town Council adhere to their previous decision not to create any smoke control areas in the Borough at present, but that a further report be submitted by the officers in twelve months'time; (ii) That the Minister of Housing and Local Government be informed that in the opinion of the Town Council it would be much more satisfactory to the local authority and householders seeking grants towards the cost of installing smokeless heating appliances if a simple procedure, similar to that appertaining to improvement grants under the Housing (Financial Provisions)Act, 1958, could be substituted for the existing cumbersome procedure for grant applications under the Clean Air Act, 1956. MOVEABLE POLLINGS. During the year thirty licences to station and use moveable dwellings (caravans) were granted under section 269, Public Health Act, 1936, and one site licence under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960, which came into effect on 29th August, 1960. By the end of the year the permanent sites had been to:- 1. The Riverhill Estate the lease of which is held by a local Sports Club and where 36 caravans are permitted. 2. One caravan in the orchard of a private house. 3. A temporary summer-house type of dwelling on a large plot of land used only occasionally. A great deal of trouble was caused by itinerant caravan dwellers who suddenly became attracted by the open site at Tolworth Broadway. They moved on and off with considerable frequency, especially during the period of race meetings at Epsom. Much annoyance was caused to shopkeepers and inhabitants of the neighbourhood and it became necessary to apply to the Magistrates for an Order under the Surrey County Council Act, 1931, requiring the removal of caravans and prohibiting further stationing thereof. This was fairly effective in dealing with the problem though from time to time caravans appeared and had to be ordered off. A piece of vacant land in Roebuck Road although in an area already subject to a Prohibition Order also brought trouble from caravans and Court proceedings were necessary to enforce compliance with the Order. DISINFECTION. (a) (i) During the year disinfection was carried out free of charge at eleven premises as under Tuberculosis 7 Miscellaneous 4 (ii) Disinfection was also carried out at twenty premises where non-infectious illnesses had occurred on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost. (iii)ln two cases bedding was destroyed on request, the occupier in each case paying the cost (non-infectious illness). (b) The total number of articles disinfected by steam at the Tolworth Hospital, or destroyed was Disinfected: Destroyed: Blankets 10 Mattresses 15 Pillows 8 Pillow cases 10 Sheets 44 Counterpanes 2 Curtains 7 Towels 6 Miscellaneous 3 103 5 (c) No. of rooms disinfected 42 No. of library books disinfected 61 DISINFESTATION. Method employed for disinfestation:Spraying with insecticide 11 (b) School Canteens. At the request of the,Surrey County Council thirteen school canteens were sprayed with insecticide to prevent flies and other insect pests, the-County Council paying the cost of the work. (c) General. Advice is frequently sought from the Department in theidentification and measures for eradication of insect pests of various kinds. For the convenience of the public a small stock of insecticides and sprayers is held in the Department, and these articles.are sold at cost price when required. This service seems to "be very.much .appreciated. As in the. previous year a number of requests were received 45. (a) Bed bugs, etc. Council Houses: Other Houses: Found to be infested Disinfested Found to be infection Disifested Bugs - - 7 7 Fleas 1 1 3 3 DISINFESTATIOK (Cont). (c) General (cont.) for assistance in dealing with wasps nests. The Council has no obligation in this connection, nor indeed any trained workmen available for the purpose, but advice is given in each individual case and a suitable insecticide supplied at a very low cost. It is nearly always possible to destroy wasps with such materials without risk to the operator if the necessary action is taken at sundown. In difficult cases complainants are referred to a local beekeeper who is willing for a small fee to undertake the task. PUBLIC MORTUARY. During the year 72 bodies were received into the mortuary for post-mortem examination. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT.1948. 1. It was not necessary to make any burial arrangements as provided by Section 50 of the Act. 2. It was not necessary to make use of the powers of Section bl for compulsory removal to suitable premises of sick or aged persons in need of care and attention. THE HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS)ACT. 1952. This Act which prohibits the sale, or letting, of certain heating appliances without an effective fireguard, together with Regulations made by the Secretary of State, has been operative since 1954. Twenty-one visits were made to premises in the Borough and a warning was given in one case where such an appliance was not satisfactory. THE PET ANIMALS ACT, 1.251s. This Act is designed "to regulate the sale of pet animals". Six premises were licensed during the year. Twenty-two inspections were made but no infringements of the licence conditions found. SHOPS ACT,1950. One hundred and fifty-four visits were made in the administration of this Act, and two infringements corrected. "Shop" for the purpose of this Act is a very comprehensive term and includes any premises where any retail trade or business is carried on. The number of such premises in the Borough at the 46. SHOPS ACT,1950 (Cont) end of 1960 was:- Antique dealers and secondhand furniture 11 Bakers 19 Boots and shoes 29 Builders and Decorators supplies 27 Butchers 37 Cafes and Restaurants 37 Chemists 24 Confectioners, newsagents and tobacconists 92 Cycles, radio and television 26 Dairies 8 Drapers and Ladies' outfitters h9 Electrical supplies 13 Fishmongers and Fried Fish Shops 16 General stores 12 Greengrocers,Fruiterers and Florists 58 Grocers and Provision Merchants 78 Hairdressers h3 Hardware, Ironmongery and Timber 2h Licensed premises 52 Motor and Cycle Dealers and Engineers 30 Tailors and Outfitters 19 Upholsterers and House Furnishers Watchmakers and Jewellers 9 Miscellaneous 79 806 The present unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to shops is to be deplored. The 1950 Act is merely a consolidation of legislation passed "between 1912 and 1938 and is to a large degree outmoded. Further, there have been many decisions given by the Courts which have rendered much of the Act virtually incomprehensible and consequently inoperable. It seems most desirable for the sake of traders, public and local authorities, as well as for Inspectors trying to carry out their duties in a state of confusion, that the situation should be straightened out at an early date. FACTORIES ACTS;1937 to 1959. The total number of factories on the register at the end of the year was 275 (239 mechanical, 19 non-mechanical and 17 works of building construction). Three hundred and ninety-two visits were made to these premises and work was carried out to remedy contraventions found as under Particulars: No. of cases in which defect found and remedied: Want of cleanliness. 1 Insufficient sanitary conveniences 1 Unsuitable or defective sanitary conveniences. 25 Other offences, etc. 23 47 FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 to 1959 (cont). Six certificates were issued under section 34 of the Factories Act, 1937, that the factories to which they related were provided with such means of escape in case of fire for the persons employed therein as may he reasonably required in the circumstances. For many years the Council has been responsible for the issue of Certificates as to Means of Escape in case of Fire from certain types of factory, hut this duty was transferred to the Surrey County Council as the fire authority on 1st December, 1960. There were 75 outworkers on the register at the end of the year. Thirty-two visits were made hut no infringements found. 1.

The Prevention of Damage "by Pests Act, 1949, places upon the occupiers or, in certain circumstances the owners, of land (including buildings) the responsibility for the destruction of rats and mice thereon and for keeping the land free from such pests. It is the duty of the Council to carry out inspections to see that this is done, and to secure so far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. Where necessary they may serve upon owners or occupiers notices requiring them to take steps for this purpose and penalties are laid down for failure to comply with such notices. The policy of the Council is, however, to give such assistance as is possible to the occupiers of private dwelling houses. For that purpose they permit their own small rodent control staff, who are primarily engaged to deal with Corporation property (including sewers) to give advice and practical help where appropriate, without charge, subject to the signing of the "Request for Treatment" form. The Council is under no legal obligation to do this and does not undertake to provide a service for the destruction of vermin, but allows its staff to help so far as time permits. Many requests are received and are responded to as quickly as possible, and in the order received as far as practicable, but at times it is as long as a week before complaints can be dealt with. Every effort is made to give householders the best possible service with the staff available. Forty-eight schools, business or industrial premises, and two agricultural properties were treated by the Council's staff on payment of the cost involved by the occupiers or owners concerned. The figures which follow indicate the extent of the work carried out during the year. It seems that the rodent population is being kept down to as low a level as is likely to be achieved until new techniques are evolved and perhaps new poisons introduced. During June, the 20th maintenance treatment of the Corporation's sewer system was carried out; in October, the 12th annual test baiting of the sewer system was completed and this was followed up with the 21st maintenance treatment in November. 50 VISITS.
