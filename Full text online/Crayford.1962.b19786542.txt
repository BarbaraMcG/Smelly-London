Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1962 which has been prepared on the lines set out in Circular 1/63 of the Ministry of Health. The Registrar General's estimate of the mid-year population is 31,980 (31,290 in 1961). The vital statistics supplied annually by the General Register Office indicate that the general trend of the health of the District remained satisfactory. The standardised death rate, which allows of comparisons with other areas, was 10.77 per 1,000 of the home population (10.58 in 1961) compared with 11.9 for England and Wales. The standardised birth rate was 15.81 per 1,000 home population (17.18 in 1961) compared with a rate of 18.0 for the country as a whole. The number of infants who died during the first year of life was 11 (13 in 1961) giving an infant mortality rate of 20.44 per 1,000 live births (22.73 in 1961) compared with 21.6 per 1,000 for England and Wales. For the second successive year there was no maternal death associated with childbirth. Considering that during the past two years there were 1,110 births in the District it may be said that the antenatal and obstetric services in the area have worked to a high standard of efficiency. The stillbirth rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births was 7.38 (compared to 10.38, 7.55, 11.95 and 18.1 in the previous four years). The number of illegitimate births rose to 22 compared with 17, 15, 11, 15, 15, 11, 19, 16 and 11 in the previous nine years. Deaths from cancer of the lung numbered 12 (14 in 1961). For the thirteenth year in succession there was no case of diphtheria in the District and no case of poliomyelitis in the year under review. The years 1961 and 1962 will be remembered for the fact that on five separate occasions during this period smallpox was brought into this country by air travellers from Karachi resulting in 62 cases in England and Wales of which 24 proved fatal. Although there was no real threat to the District an indirect effect of these cases was the overwhelming public demand for vaccination. The occurrence of a single case of smallpox in Woolwich in January, 1962, caused a local agitation for vaccination clinics to be opened but this was successfully resisted. Nevertheless many hundreds of people in the District received vaccination through their family doctors and many cases of vaccinia occurred some of which simulated smallpox and raised difficult problems of diagnosis. I 2 should like to place on record the help which we received in this connection from Dr. J.V. Armstrong of the Brook Hospital one of our local smallpox consultants. It is a matter of continual surprise that public anxiety on such occasions can be so great but that, during quiescent periods there should be so much neglect of routine vaccination There are good reasons why parents should ensure the primary vaccination of their children in infancy, not the least being the risk of severe reactions and the possibility, however small, of post-vaccinal encephalitis when primary vaccination against smallpox is carried out in adolescence or in later life In March, 1962, the report of the Royal College of Physicians on Snoking and Health was published and confirmed very convincingly the association that exists between heavy cigarette smoking and cancer of the lung Its initial impact on the public was considerable but there is now a real danger that the report with all its implications, will be forgotten unless vigorous action is taken by the Government, local authorities and other responsible bodies to keep the issue alive as one of the outstanding public health problems of the day At the time of writing a five-day visit to the area of a mobile unit of the Central Council for Health Education is being planned to act as a spearhead in a week's campaign concerned, mainly, with the problem of smoking by schoolchildren We are approaching the end of an era in local government in the Greater London Area With the London Government Act, 1963, on the Statute Book one is becoming increasingly pre-occupied with the future of the Health and Welfare Services in the proposed London Borough 18 The orderly take-over of these services will need careful thought and preparation particularly in regard to the basic administrative structure to be adopted This should be such as to allow for the organic growth of these services in the years to come, In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and encouragement, and the Chief Public Health Inspector, Chief Clerk, and all members of the Health Department for the good work which has been done during the year. I acknowledge also the help and co operation received from other Departments of the Council I am, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LANDON Medical Officer of Health 3 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA Area (in acres) 2,698.71 Population (Registrar-General's estimate mid-year 1962) 31,980 Number of separate dwellings 10,076 Rateable value £500, 934 Sum represented by a penny rate £2, 050 Live Births Total M P Legitimate 516 271 245 Illegitimate 22 9 13 538 280 258 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population - 16.82 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births - 4.09% General birth rate for England and Wales - 18.0 Stillbirths Total M F Legitimate 3 2 1 Illegitimate 1 - 1 4 2 2 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births - 7.38 Total M F Deaths 257 145 113 Death rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population - 8.04 General death rate for England and Wales - 11.9 The Registrar General has supplied comparability factors for 1962 The standardised Birth Rate which allows for comparison with other parts of the country is 15.81 and the standardised Death Rate is 10.77 Maternal Deaths There were no maternal deaths in 1962 Deaths of Infants under one year of age Total M F Legitimate 10 5 5 Illegitimate 1 - 1 11 5 6 Rate per 1,000 live births (Crayford) - 20.44 Rate per 1,000 legitimate live births - 19.38 Neo Natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births - 9.30 Early Neo Natal mortality rate per 1,000 live births - 7.43 Perinatal mortality rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births - 14,85 General death rate of infants under 1 year of age for England and Wales 21,6 Deaths from Various Causes Malignant Neoplasm (all ages) 60 Measles (all ages) - Diarrhoea (under 2 years of age) - 5 6 Vital Statistics during 1962 and previous years YEAR POPULATION LIVE BIRTHS DEATHS INFANT DEATHS No. RATE NO.

Clothing, coal supplies and fares to visit relatives in Sanatoria had once again formed the bulk of the assistance given by the Committee The result of the local Christmas Seals Sale, including the mail sale as reported by the Organiser to the Annual General Meeting, amounted to £118 13s. 8d. The County Organiser, Health Visitor, Chest Physician and District Officer have given invaluable service to the Committee. Welfare of Old People This continued to place an increasing demand on the services of the Health Department and the Crayford Old People's Welfare Committee. Many cases brought to the notice of the Department by the Committee Visitors and otherwise discovered, have been visited by the Medical Officer of Health and Chief Public Health Inspector. Arrangements have been made for entry into Old People's Homes where this has been possible. The Visiting Service carried out by the Crayford Old People's Welfare Committee continues to flourish. Help is given to the old folk with clothing and small home comforts. Many services have been rendered to elderly people and much assistance is given by other Voluntary Organisations to the Old People's Welfare Committee. Close Co-operation is maintained with the Kent County Council's District Officer, the National Assistance Board, the Women's Voluntary Service, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and Nursing Division and the Red Cross. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 50 of the Act, it is the duty of the local authority to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who has died in the area if it appears that no suitable arrangements for the disposal of the body can otherwise be made. It was necessary to arrange one burial under this Section during the year. _ 17 CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT To The Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Crayford. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1962, which gives a general summary of the work carried out by the Public Health Inspectors during the year. Inspection and Supervision of Food One cannot relax one's efforts on the very important field of food hygiene and a considerable amount of time was spent by your Public Health Inspectors in respect of this matter. In this connection, no fewer than 247 visits were made, 95 being to premises registered under Section 16 of the Pood and Drugs Act. 12 informal notices were served under the Food Hygiene Regulations and in 10 cases repairs or improvements were carried out. I am pleased to be able to, once again, comment favourably on the continuing co-operation received from the various tradespeople, in spite of the fact that in the case of the larger establishments, staff changes appear sharply on the increase. This has, of necessity, called for constant vigilance to ensure maintenance of standards. The same applies in a more moderate way as regards the smaller shops where there have been several changes of occupier. Recent development and improvements in the main shopping area have also had an effect in that the greater variety of modern facilities has, I understand, attracted a greater proportion of local trade. The number of food premises in the area is as follows:- Bakers 4, Butchers 18; Grocers 56; Greengrocers 20; Confectioners 25; Fishmongers 8; Cafes, Canteens, etc. 36; Public Houses 19; Off Licences 3; Clubs 12; Other Premises 30. Under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, 71 premises are registered for the storage and sale of Ice Cream and 35 for the manufacture or preparation of preserved food intended for sale Complaints The following complaints were received and dealt with during the year:- 18 Meat and Other Foods. The following articles were found during the year to be unfit for human consumption:- lbs. ozs. lbs. ozs. Beef 135 8 Luncheon Meat 46 4 Pork 87 2 Bacon 86 8 Chopped-Pork 28 14 Veal 23 0 Lamb Chops 5 0 Frozen Sliced Beef 7 3 Ham 175 1 Frozen Chicken 3 14 Cooked Gammon 11 0 Frozen Garden Peas 21 14 chicken 19 0 Frozen Fish 7 5 Offal 78 0 Frozen Vegetables 25 2½ Corned Beef 113 0 Sugar 3 0 19 Cheese Spread The cheese had become mouldy and gave off a strong smell due to the admission of air through damage to the foil covering. The vendors were contacted but some doubt arose as to actually when the damage to the coverings had taken place. Taking all the circumstances into consideration it was decided that no further action could be taken, owing to the lack of proof that it was actually sold in this condition. Tinned Steak and Kidney Pudding,, This was alleged to have given off a strong smell when cooked The sample was sent for analysis but the cooking process had to some extent masked the condition of the pudding The manufacturers however withdrew stocks although examination of further tins of the product proved satisfactory Under the circumstances however, no proceedings were taken Sparkling Orange Mineral. No further action was deemed necessary in respect of the alleged phenolic flavour of this product. This was caused by a small amount of phenol present, judged not to be harmful. Cream Cakes Mould in cream cakes led to legal proceedings against the retailer resulting in a £5 fine. The complaint had arisen due to the cakes having been kept too long in the shop before sale. Self Raising Flour. It was alleged that when mixed with other ingredients, the mixture became a frothy substance Upon analysis, the flour appeared normal and was consequently not the cause of the unusual effect. No further action, therefore was necessary. Sliced Brown Loaf0 Presence of hair like material in this instance, believed to have come from oven gloves, resulted in legal proceedings the fine being £35 with 5 guineas^costs. Sliced White Loafc The presence of mould in this loaf resulted in prosecution and fine of £10 with 3 guineas costs. lbs. ozs. lbs. ozs.

Generally, however, the area has operated quite smoothly and the effect of the Smoke Control has been noticeable. Immediately after the coming into operation of No 1 Area, work was commenced on the survey for area No. 2 comprising over 3,600 properties, covers approximately 463 acres adjoins No. 1 Smoke Control Area and extends south-west for approximately l1/3 miles to the Urban District boundary in the vicinity of Erith Road, The area is bounded on the south side by the British Railway's line to Barnehurst, and on the north side by the Urban District's boundary with the Borough of Erith It may be of interest to note, that to date, a much larger proportion of householders favour appliances other than those using solid fuel, A further point noted is that there has not been the same reluctance on the part of occupiers to lose their old fashioned open coal fires. It is not out of place to mention that with such a complex problem as the establishment of Smoke Control Areas, I have found my task made considerably less difficult by the ready and willing co-operation from other Departments of the Council. I would also like to express my appreciation to the District Public Health Inspectors whose endeavours and tactful approach have greatly assisted operations, and as a consequence, most satisfactory progress has been made with the present Scheme.

The waters are not liable to have plumbo solvent action and there has been no evidence of contamination of Crayford or other wells during the year.

Twice during the year the foul water system was treated for rats. A new departure from the usual practice was adopted to expedite Sewer Treatment procedure For some time past difficulty had been experienced in raising a number of manhole covers. Assistance and co-operation from the Engineer and Surveyor enabled additional labour lifting mechanisms and motor transport to be made available which greatly facilitated operations. Sewer infestation remains remarkably low Other pest infestations dealt with were as follows: 25 Swimming Pool Period open from 12th May to 16th September. Number of bathers - 30,729 This figure does not include school parties and clubs. Shops Act A total number of l23 visits were made during the year This figure includes Sunday and evening visits Two warnings were given. Three instances of carpets being sold from cafe premises after the permitted hours, resulted in the occupiers being warned that any future contravention would result in the consideration of appropriate legal action., With further reference to the several changes of occupiers, already mentioned earlier in this report, rather more than usual information has been sought regarding Sunday Trading and Closing Hours. Also during the year assistance was given to the local branch of the National Hairdressers Federation, who had in mind amendment of the shop hours for this class of shop. The Council did accede to the Federation's request but it was mutually agreed to leave the matter in abeyance for the time being Byelaws made under Section 77 of the Public Health Act, 1961, relating to Hairdressers and Barbers were adopted and came into force on the 1st June,1962. Local standards are such that there has been no need to take any action in respect thereof.
