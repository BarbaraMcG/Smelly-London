On the 1st January, 1889, the Commissioners opened; Temporary Reading Room at 107 and 108, Long Acre, and (as will be seen from the accompanying table of attendances) the number of readers has been very large, taxing the capacity of the room to th utmost. The periodicals provided number 118, and include the principal London and some of the provincial daily papers, a French and German daily, and all the leading weekly papers, and monthly and quarterly magazines. To supplement the periodicals the Commissioners have supplied fully 1,100 volumes of popular biography, history, science, fiction, etc., for use in the room. These have been largely used. table of attendances. Days open. Number of Visitors. Daily Average.

Annual Report on the Health of the Parish of St. Martin -in-the-FieIds, for the Year 1888. To the Vestry of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Nineteenth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. In my Annual Report for the previous year, 1887, I mentioned the outbreak of Scarlet Fever in the Metropolis, which epidemic continued on for the first few months of the year 1888. In London the number of deaths due to this disease in the year 1888, was 1209, a mortality less than in the previous year. In our own parish every precaution was taken against the spread of the complaint, in the way of isolation and disinfection, with the result that it was a very rare event for a second case to occur in the same house. Many cases of Scarlet Fever are concealed from the Sanitary Authority, when, of course, the necessary safeguards are not so well applied for the protection of the community. The Compulsory Notification of Infectious Diseases would get over this difficulty. Births. In the year 1.888 the Births numbered 276, the lowest number of the last ten years. The following Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 10 16 26 February 19 20 39 March 15 13 28 April 16 10 26 May 10 7 17 Carried forward 70 66 136 78  Males. Females. Total. Brought forward 70 66 136 June 9 7 16 July 14 12 26 August 11 15 26 September 9 9 18 October 8 9 17 November 15 6 21 December 7 9 16 143 133 276 The Birth-rate of the Parish for the year 1888 would be 15.0 per 1,000. The Births registered in London in 1888 numbered 131,080, and were in the proportion of 30.7 to 1,000 inhabitants. This is the lowest birth-rate recorded in London since 1841, when the rate was 30.4. Deaths. During the year 1888 the number of Deaths registered in St. Martin-in-the-Fields was 399. This mortality is the lowest of the last ten years. The following Table gives the number of Deaths registered in each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 23 23 40 February 28 12 40 March 20 12 32 April 15 8 23 May 24 14 38 June 20 12 32 Jily 22 12 34 August 21 15 36 September 15 10 25 October 29 13 42 November 21 8 29 December 12 10 22 250 149 399 Of the above 399 Deaths, 195 occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and of this number who died in that Institution, 165 were non-residents of the Parish. In public Institutions outside tho Parish, and including the parishioners of St. Martin-in-the-Fields who died in the Strand Union Workhouse, Edmonton, the deaths numbered 93. In Table No. VI. will be found full details of these 93 deaths. The Death-rate of the Parish for the year 1888 would be 17.3per 1,000, rather less than in the previous year. Patio of deaths to population, about 1 in 57. The deaths registered in London in the year 1888 numbered 78,848, and corresponded to an annual rate of 18.5 per 1,000. This is far the lowest death-rate as yet recorded in London. Appended is the annual death-rate per 1,000 in the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, during the last ten years:— 1879 18.6 1880 16.8 1881 18.5 1882 17.6 *1883 19.0 1884 19.7 1885 19.3 1886 18.2 1887 18.1 1888 17.3 The ages of these 399 deaths were as follows:— 55 were under 1 year. 45 from 1 to 5 years. 23 „ 5 „ 20 „ 80 ,, 20 ,, 40 ,, 122 „ 40 „ 60 „ 64 ., 60 „ 80 ,, 10 above 80 years. *This is the first year returns have been supplied to me from the RegistrarGeneral's Office of deaths of parishioners occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish, which deaths have been added to the death-rate.—J. J. S. 80 Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.-The seven principal Zymotic Diseases are Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. The deaths arising from this class of malady were 24. This number includes those non-parishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting those non-parishioners, and adding those parishioners who died in Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin-in-the-Fields would be 03. This mortality is in excess of the previous year, and is due to the epidemic of Scarlet Fever and Measles. See Table 5. Small-pox.—No death or illness from this disease came to my knowledge. Measles.—From this complaint 9 deaths were recorded, and of a parishioner in the Metropolitan Asylums Hospital, making total of 10. This disease assumed, in the Metropolis, an epidemic form, which began about the first week in October, after which the mortality rose very rapidly to a maximum in the middle of December, when as many as 184 deaths were registered in a single week. Scarlet Fever.—One death occurred within the Parish, one of a parishioner in King's College Hospital, and seven in the Metro- politan Asylums Hospital, making in all a total of nine. The number of cases of this complaint, which came under my notice, was 26, and 24 of these were sent to hospital. In 1887, the politan Asylums Board admitted into their hospitals 5,900 Scarlet ever cases, and in 1888, the number was 4,408. In the former year, the maximum number under treatment at one and the same time . was 2,611; in 1888, 954. The deaths in London from this disease numbered 1,209, and were in the proportion of 0-28 to 1,000 inhabi¬- tants, the average annual rate in the preceding decennium having been 0.46. Diphtheria.-Three deaths, from this disease, occurred in the Parish, all in the Charing Cross Hospital of these were non- residents, and two deaths of parishioners took place in King's .College Hospital, so that the Parish would be credited with three deaths from Diphtheria. 81 Whooping Cough.—Four deaths were attributable to this malady. Fever.—This includes Typhus, Typhoid, Simple Continued Fever, and Remittent Fever. A death from Typhus occurred in a gentleman staying at a private hotel, he was ailing when he took up his residence there. A death from Typhoid of a parishioner took place in the Central London Sick Asylum Hospital, and an inmate of the Strand Union Workhouse, who was formerly a resident of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, died of Typhoid Fever, making a total of three. Diarrhœa.—Five deaths were due to this complaint, one of which was a non-resident who died in the Charing Cross Hospital, this circumstance would credit the Parish with only four deaths, This mortality is very low, and is attributable to the very cool summer of 1888. The deaths from all other causes, with the ages at death, will be found fully detailed in Table 2. Inquests. During the year 1888, there were held 62 inquests. The causes which produced death are as follows:— Natural causes 26 Burns and Scalds 5 Poison, Lead Acetate 1 Oxalic Acid 1 Drowning 3 Pistol shot wound 1 Hanging 1 Suffocation—Infant when in bed with parents 1 „ Newly born infant 1 Strangulation—Newly born infant 1 Found dead in Green Park—Newly born infant 1 Injuries received in falling when in a fit 1 „ ,, from being knocked down or run over in the street 7 \ 82 Injuries received by coming in contact with a train at the Metropolitan District Railway Station, Charing Cross 1 Injuries received when at work on line by passing train near Charing Cross Station, S.E.R 1 Injuries received from fall on pavement 1 „ „ in fighting 1 from being crushed between a van and a wall 1 Injuries received to head from fall of a ceiling 1 „ „ when at work in a well at the Savoy Mansions 1 Injuries received from falling from a window 2 „ „ „ „ „ a brewer's dray 1 „ „ ,, „ „ from roof of house 1 Fractured ribs and other injuries, no evidence how caused 1 62 Mortuary Chapel. This most useful building, situated in Drury Lane, I have ascertained from the keeper, has had, during the last fourteen years, 373 bodies deposited in it during the interval between death and burial. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Under the above Act, 26 different articles of food were submitted to analysis, as follows:- Article. Result. 1 sample of beer genuine 7 Samples of milk 2 samples adulterated 6 ,, ,, butter genuine 3 ,, ,, bread 3 ,, ,, tea 3 ,, ,, coffee 3 ,, ,,mustard 1 sample adulterated 83 In the case of the adulterated mustard, legal proceedings were instituted, with the result that the magistrate inflicted a fine of 20s. upon the seller. Sanitary Work. During the year 1888, notices to the number of 107 were served upon the owners or occupiers of property, also numerous verbal recommendations to remedy sanitary defects, and 26 notices were served for the purpose of disinfection after infectious disease. Champion House, White Hart Street, which has been such a source of trouble and annoyance ever since it was built, owing to the unsanitary condition of the place, has been put nto a thorough state of repair, and is now occupied by a very respectable class of tenants, who are cleanly and orderly in their habits. Bake-Houses. The bake-houses have been duly inspected, aud were all found in a satisfactory condition. Houses Let Out in Lodgings. Your Inspector, whom you appointed permanent inspector of these houses, has regularly inspected them, and reported to me all sanitary defects that came under his notice. Tne pipe-sewers have been regularly flushed, those gullies emitting offensive effluvia have also been flushed with carbolic acid and water, and the several courts and passages in the parish limewhited. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, JOHN J. SKEGG, Medical Officer of Health. 29, Craven Street. f 2 84 TABLE I.
