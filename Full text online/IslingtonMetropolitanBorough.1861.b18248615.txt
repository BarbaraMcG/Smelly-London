REPORT ISL 3 11 ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JANUARY, 1861. No. XLVI. With an interval of slight thaw during three or four days at the close of last year, the frost which set in on the 18th of December, continued until the middle of January; after which the cold moderated, and the last week of the month was comparatively mild, the wind having changed from the north and east to the south-west. The effect of this prolonged frost we can now commence to reckon up. It is seen chiefly in depression of vital force, in the fatal prevalence of congestions and inflammations of the chest, the acceleration of the fatal issue in cases of chest and chronic heart disease, and in the augmented mortality from affections of the great nervous centres. The total number of deaths registered* was 331. The mean (uncorrected) for the four previous years being 221. . I have not yet recorded a mortality during four weeks, which at all approaches this number. The weekly deaths were 83, 82, 87 and 79. The depressing influence of the cold weather fell with greatest force upon those whose power of vital resistance was enfeebled by old age. Of the 331 deaths, 94 were of persons above 60 years of age; 3 were aged 80 years, 3 were aged 82, 3 aged 83, 6 aged 84, 1 aged 87, 5 aged 88, 1 aged 93, 1 aged 94, and 2 aged 96 years. By far the greater number of these were persons in comfortable circumstances. Of those above 80, 7 were * It will be observed that the mortuary table Has been re-modelled to correspond with the form which has received the sanction of the International Statistical Congress, and which is now in use by the Registrar General. males, aged respectively 80, 82, 83 and 84; all the rest, those above 84, being females, mostly widows, none having husbands living. The registered deaths from respiratory diseases (bronchitis, pneumonia, and asthma) amounted to 90, the mean of the four previous years being 62; of these 59 were over 40 years of age. There were in addition 24 deaths from diseases of the heart, which are almost constantly attended with pulmonary complications. Thirteen deaths from apoplexy and paralysis, and altogether 39 from diseases affecting the nervous system were registered. Hooping cough was fatal to 27 young children. Seventy-three cases of this affection were entered on the books of the Parochial Surgeons and two Dispensaries ; the weekly numbers being 22, 11, 15 and 25. Two more cases of typhoid fever have arisen in the family occupying The Lodge in Highbury-place, one of them fatal: out of eight persons therefore in this family, seven have been attacked, and two have died. The family is at last removing, and there could now, I imagine, be no difficulty in taking proceedings, under the 13th section of the Nuisances Removal Act, to obtain a prohibition of the re-occupation of the dwelling.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON FOR FEBRUARY, 1861. No. XLVII. The mortality of the parish during the four weeks terminating on the 23rd of February, was 241, a diminution by 90 deaths from that during the preceding month. The uncorrected mean of the corresponding four weeks, during the four previous years, is 221. The deaths then cannot be regarded as much in excess. Hooping-cough and fever have been less fatal, and fewer deaths have been referred to diseases of heart and lungs. The deaths of young persons have fallen from 148 to 108, and of those over 60 years from 94 to 57. The mortality from scarlet fever has slightly increased. One death has been registered as the result of choleraic diarrhoea. A person in "independent" circumstances died in St. Paul's Road at the age of 102. He was born in Liverpool, served when a young man in the Navy, and had resided in Islington and its neighbourhood for about 30 years. The age can be authenticated. His family has been remarkable for longevity: his grandmother died at the age of 103J, and his brother at 98 years. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, Vestry Offices, March 8th, 1861.

No. XLVIII. The public health in Islington during the past month, as measured by the registered mortality, has been satisfactory. The deaths have been 260, six below the un-corrected mean of the previous four years. They have also been 41 less than they would have been at the rate of mortality observed in February. The diminution is observable especially in the zymotic maladies, and in diseases of the organs of respiration. Of the former, hooping-cough alone has continued unusually prevalent, having occasioned 25 deaths, the mean mortality for four years being 13. In No. 23 of these reports I recorded the death of a man from "starvation," in Adelaide Square. Another entry of a similar character has been made by the Registrar, viz., "on February 15, at 10, Adelaide Square, son of a domestic servant, aged 2 years and 9 months. Inflammation of the lungs and want of sufficient nourishment and medical aid." The neglected condition of this miserable place is a standing disgrace to its proprietors and a reproach to sanitary legislation. Eight cases of small-pox have occurred in the practice of the Parochial Medical Officers and of the Dispensaries. EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, April 8th, 1861.

"Were it not that hooping-cough has been increasingly and very fatally prevalent among children, having carried off no less than 36 of them within the period of four weeks, the general health of the pariah has been about as good as the average for April. The mortality as registered was 237. The wrc-corrected mean for five years previously being 203, — the corrected number for increased population, will probably be not far from 232. Within 11, the deaths registered from hooping-cough this April amount to the total number registered in the five preceding Aprils taken together, viz., 47. The number of case3 attended by the Parochial Surgeons was 31; the numbers in the five previous Aprils being 11, 18, 26, 12, and 11. It has been, if not twice as prevalent, certainly twice as fatal as it was in the same period of the year in 1858. The Mortality Table includes 3 deaths from diphtheria—one being that of a promising young surgeon in St. Paul's Road, who contracted the disease in the courageous discharge of his professional duties. 4 2 A report having reached me of an outbreak of fever in a Female Reformatory in Cornwall Place, I proceeded to investigate the circumstances. Only one case appeared to have really been a well defined case of fever, although several of the inmates on making complaint of illness subsequently were, as a precautionary measure, moved into the Fever Hospital I found, however, that many of the dormitories, especially that one from which the cases of illness proceeded, were so greatly overcrowded that I felt called upon to communicate my opinion on the matter to the Managing Committee of the establishment.

There were 225 deaths registered during the four weeks of May, which, although fewer than were registered in April, exceed the mean of the five former years. This mean is 175 as number which must be raised by about l-6th, viz. to 204, to allowed as per our increased population, before it can be compared with the mortality of the past month. The deaths thus have been 21 in excess with the corrected average. Hooping-cough has been continuing??? prevalent among children, the number of cases recorded in Table II. showing no decrease upon those in my last Report, although the registered deaths have fallen from 36 to 28. Three cases of small-pox have occurred in the pauper practice, and 1 in that of the Holloway Dispensary, and 2 deaths from this malady have been registered. There have been 4 deaths from diphtheria. 2 On the whole, there has been among the lower classes rather less sickness than in April, the diminution, being, however, in those less definite or chronic maladies whose nature we do not specify particularly in the Table.

The deaths registered in five weeks, ending June 29th, were 243, a number which also represents the average deaths in June for five years previously, when augmented for comparison with those occurring among our greatly-increased population. The deaths from hooping-cough have fallen from 28 in four weeks to 13 in five weeks, a diminution which, on comparing Tables I. and II., appears due rather to diminished fatality than to a lessening of the number of cases of this disease. Hooping-cough has been the prevalent disease among young children for 10 months. As usual in this month we begin to perceive the approaches of summer diarrhœa; five deaths from this disease, one from dysentery, and one from choloraic diarrhœa, have been registered. The public might keep this summer tendency greatly in check if they would observe scrupulous cleanliness about their habitations, removing from within and without all offensive matters and decomposing accumulations, having their house drains flushed, and consuming only such 2 articles of food and drink as are pure and untainted. The latter point I mention specially now, because I have within the month seen hazardous meat at 2d. per lb. exposed for sale on a Sunday morning, and stale shell fish on Saturday nights, in certain shops in Islington. The public should know that the authorities are able and quite willing to protect them against such sources of disease by confiscating all such unwholesome food as may come under their notice, and by fining the offenders. The following Table represents the progress of bowel complaints, with the mean weekly temperature during June of this and previous years:— June. Mean Temperature. (Greenwich.)

B REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON, FOR JULY, 1861. No. LII. The indices by which we judge of the state of the public health are the returns of death in the parish at large, and of sickness in certain large classes of the population. The Tables both of sickness and mortality, present then an unusually favourable account for the month of July. The number of deaths registered was 196. The mean mortality of July in five previous years, augmented by one-sixth for an increase of population, is 234. The total cases of sickness from all causes, as entered in the books of the parochial surgeons, has also been smaller than in any July for the last five years. Bowel complaints which never fail to occur at this season, have hitherto not been as rife as usual. The infant deaths from this cause were 28, the corrected average for July being 34. Hooping-cough also under the influence of the warm weather, appears to be diminishing in prevalence. 2 In my last report I mentioned the importance, at this season of the year especially, of scrupulous personal and domestic cleanliness as well as of a careful avoidance of unwholesome food. I may add now that in the counteracting of offensive and injurious miasmata, one of the most effectual agents is the sprinkling about of McDougals disinfecting powder. A cheap and effectual disinfectant also, which might he readily prepared for distribution to the poor, consists in sand or marl, or dry plaster well mixed with a small quantity of coal-tar. July.

The continuance of the hot weather, the mean temperature being 62.9, has had its customary influence upon the public health. The registered mortality for the month has been 235: the mean of five previous years, augmented by one-sixth for increased population, being 213, we must conclude that there has been recorded an excess of 22 deaths over the average. Fifty-two deaths occurred from various forms of bowel complaint, the corrected mean of five years being 35. All but four were of young children under five years of age, 34 being in their first year. Nearly all these deaths from bowel complaint occurred amongst the children of the lower classes. It is these who are the main sufferers from extremes of temperature, fatal attacks of chest disease arising in the winter from deficient protection against the cold, and of bowel affections in the summer arising from the malarious atmosphere breathed within the house in their hot, crowded, and stifling bed-rooms, and without the house from the putrescent gases issuing from untrapped drains, unwashed privies, and unpaved yards, the earth of which is saturated only too commonly with everything that is offensive. Private practitioners on the other hand have found but little sickness of any kind during the month. This probably arises from the yearly improving sanitary habits of the better classes and more intelligent, and from the fact that all who can by any means afford it, now spend a portion of each summer with their families away from town. With such, one of the most frequent causes of summer infantile diarrhœa is the mistake of weaning infants at this season. It should be generally known that the summer is the very worst time of the year for this purpose, and that every effort should be made to defer the process until the setting in of the colder weather. 2 One of the six deaths from summer cholera was so certified by Mr. Gill: the patient was a domestic servant in Packington Street, she had felt ill on the 29th, 30th, and 31st of July, and on the 31st had taken a dose of medicine given her by a lodger; she felt pretty well on August 1st, but in the evening was seized with diarrhoea and vomiting, for which she obtained an astringent mixture; when Mr. Gill saw her on the 2nd the discharges were stopped, so that their choleraic character was not ascertained, collapse came on in the course of the night of the 2nd and she died early in the morning of the 3rd. On enquiry into the sanitary condition of the house, the water cistern was found exceedingly dirty. There have been registered 8 deaths from scarlet fever and 8 from diphtheria, the weekly numbers from scarlatina being 1, 1, 2, 4, and from diphtheria 0, 0, 5, 3. Tour cases of scarlet fever also have appeared at the Infant poor house. The first occurred on the 16th in a boy who had been in the house as long as 12 days. I know it must be exceedingly difficult to prevent the entrance of infection from so infectious a disease as this into such an establishment, but no pains should be spared and no precautions should be considered too minute to bar its entrance, or when it has entered to prevent its spread and its recurrence at some future time. The last time this disease obtained a footing in the Infant poor house was when the disease was very prevalent outside at the close of the year 1858.

No. LIV. The registered mortality of the Parish, during the five weeks ending the 28th of September, was 255. The mean of the previous five years, corrected for population, is 252. The unusual warmth of the two first weeks of the month appears to have contributed to the continuance of the summer diarrhoea, which proved fatal to 37 individuals, of whom 33 were under three years of age. Scarlet fever has been on the increase in most parts of the Parish ; judging by the returns of the Parochial Medical Officers, the poor in the neighbourhood of the Hornsey Road and Queen's Road, and those in St. Mary's Ward appear to be the principal sufferers. The spread of this disease is less than many others under the control of measures of public hygiene, although overcrowding and filth evidently promote its diffusion, and putrid miasmata impress a fatal character on its attacks. But when it is considered that the poison or matter of infection attaches itself with the most remarkable readiness to articles of dress, bedding and furniture, nay, even to the very walls of the room, and adheres to them with a pertinacity perhaps scarcely equalled by any other morbid poison, one can easily see that a principal proventive of the disease must consist in the institution of measures of a 2 purely domestic character, I make no apology for the repetition of all this. There has been no fresh case at the Infant Poor House since September 8th. The weekly deaths from the disease have been 1,1, 2, 1, 6. There have been eight deaths from diphtheria, the weekly numbers being 2, 1, 3, 2, 0. Cases of sore-throat have been unusually numerous. Some of them have probably been cases of scarlatina without eruption. The public should know that apparently simple cases of sore-throat may communicate this disease.

No. LV. Two hundred and twenty-three deaths were registered during the four weeks of October, an excess of 19 over the corrected mean mortality of the month in the previous five years. The cause of this excess has been mainly in certain chronic forms of disease—consumption, cancer, and diseases of the heart. The zymotic mortality, speaking in general terms, has been below the average, and also altogether lower than it was in September. One disease however shows a remarkable increase, both in cases and in mortality; this is scarlet fever—the number of cases in which it has been fatal during the month is 28, the weekly numbers being 6-3-11-8. On referring to tables of former years, it will be found that in October 1858, the number of fatal cases was 25; in 1857, 27; and again, 27 last year. In one family, in a highly respectable street, where five children were from a most trivial exposure simultaneously attacked, two died within the first two days from the primary shock of the malady. In another family, in a neighbouring house, there have also been two deaths. Two deaths have occurred at a house in Milton's Yard, and one from subsequent dropsy at the Infant Poor-house. No fresh cases have occurred in this establishment. The weekly cases of scarlatina in the practice of the parochial medical officers and dispensaries have been 13-9-14-12. The dropsy, 2 which is apt to succeed scarlet fever, and which, as will be seen above, is sometimes fatal and very commonly troublesome to manage, is often the result of imprudent exposure of the surface of the body to chills during convalescence, and before the natural functions of the skin have been fully restored. I have repeatedly mentioned the percautions which should be taken to avoid the infection of this disease, and to purify clothing, bedding and furniture, which are so apt to retain and convey it. I may add now, as some guide to the public in avoiding the disease, that the liability to it gradually increases from a very trifling liability in infants at the breast up to five years of age, that it remains high between five and ten years, lessens from ten to twenty years, and is very much less from twenty to forty, above which the disease is decidedly of rare occurrence. The fatality however, when persons of different ages are attacked, is in a different ratio; it is highest by far in infancy, and gradually lessens as age advances. The above is the general result of some tables I have constructed from enquiries carried on in this parish during the greater part of three years. I ought as another guide to add, that not only are women in childbed especially liable to suffer from the infection, but the fever which results is of a prostrating type. The Inspector of the Eastern division has seized during the month, at two butcher's shops, forty-four pounds of unwholesome meat, exposed on the board for sale.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OP SAINT MARY, ISLINGTON FOR NOVEMBER, 1861. No. LVI. The mortality registered during the month has been about the average. The deaths amounted to 215; the mean of the previous five years corrected for increased population being 216. In the three last Novembers they were severally 231, 232 and 226. The diseases forming the zymotic class were altogether less fatal than they were in October, and especially those were so which most depended for their severity upon causes of local miasma. Scarlet Fever however, has shown but little abatement in its fatality. It has been the chief cause of death among these maladies. It was fatal during the month to 25 persons, of whom two were adults: in October the registered deaths from scarlet fever were 28. The weekly deaths were 5,6,9,5. The weekly cases of scarlet fever at the two Dispensaries, with those entered in the books of the Parochial Surgeons, were 16,9,13,8. The disease has been most prevalent in the southern half of the parish; the wards which have chiefly suffered being Thornhill, Barnsbury, St. Peter's, and St. Mary's. Milton's Yard and the Irish courts by the Turnpike, with their neighbourhoods, are those which have been suffering most severely. In consequence of its spreading through the medium of a school near the Irish courts, I thought it proper to recommend the dispersal of the children, and I communicated with the authorities of other schools in the locality, warning them to be careful how they received or retained children from infected families and houses. 2 Three persons over 90 years of age have died during the month, the oldest being, I believe, the most aged member of the College of Physicians: his age was 94 years. Among the deaths registered was one of a young lady, aged 13 years, from apoplexy, after only 17 hours illness. The attack was believed to be induced by intense application to her studies at school. If you refer to the 23rd number of these reports you will find a similar occurrence recorded, but the subject was then a boy aged 13 years. No good end can possibly be gained by overtaxing the mental powers of children. They can but take in a limited amount of knowledge however long the hours of study may be extended, and all overstraining of the attention under the stimulus of competition at school should, in the interests of a child's health and the ultimate result of the teaching be resolutely discouraged by the parents. To impress teachers or schoolmasters with the fact, that nothing but evil can arise from the practice of overworking the mind of the young is a task I regard as hopeless. Parents must take the matter into their own hands and set their faces firmly against it. The amount of real useful knowledge to be acquired at school is positively as nothing compared with the mental training undergone; and to this, with the development of a healthy frame of body, the acquisition of mere learning should be regarded as strictly subordinate.

The mortality of the past month has been 61 below the corrected average of the previous five years, the registered deaths being 291 and the corrected mean 352. The only disease much in excess has been scarlet fever. From this and the subsequent dropsy there have been registered 25 deaths, five in each week, a trifling diminution upon the weekly numbers registered in November. Of these 25, three occurred in one family of eight, occupying two rooms at 16, Newhall Street. In this street containing 223 inhabitants, 8 deaths have occurred during the year.

BY EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., (Lond.) member of the royal college of physicians ; fellow of the royal medical and chirurgical society of london, etc., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH LONDON: J. & I. TIREBUCK, PRINTERS & LITHOGRAPHERS, MONKWELL STREET, CITY, AND ISLINGTON. 1862. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. MARY, ISLINGTON. Gentlemen, 1. I have the honour to submit to you my Sixth Annual Report. The census of the population taken on the 8th of April, last year, enables me to do so -under / circumstances unusually favourable to accuracy. The population of Islington (revised) has been announced to be 155,341. It represents an addition of 60,012 persons in the course of ten years. The increase, supposing it to have been uniform during that period, has been at the rate of about five per cent, each year upon the population of the preceding year. With the announcement of this fact, we acquire a new standing place on which we may estimate, with as close an approximation to truth as is possible, our rate of mortality for the year, from which we may review that of past years, and from which we have to start afresh in- our calculations in future. The whole of the facts are not, however, yet in our possession; awaiting them, I propose to make the best use of those we have. Shortly after the census was taken, the Registrar-General, whose courteous assistance has ever been most readily rendered to the Health Officers of the Metropolis, furnished to me, as well as to others who desired it, a copy of the names of the streets, &c., assigned to each of the 129 enumerators employed in the Parish, with a statement of the number of persons (distinguishing the sexes) and families, together with the number of inhabited houses, and of houses in course of construction, returned by each of them. This information, although not all that I hope to be able to obtain, has been of great service to me. By grouping together those little districts, taking my local knowledge as a guide, I have been able to map out our Parish into 35 larger districts, not always exactly bounded as I could have wished, but still sufficiently characterised by certain conditions, which constitute them into distinctive localities. In respect of each I have been able to state the population, number of families, and number of inhabited houses it contains, to estimate the crowding of persons within it, by calculating the number of families and of persons occupying each house on an average, and to represent it by writing these results into the different sized spaces which the several districts exhibit upon a map reduced on the scale of six inches to a mile from the ordnance map. But as "crowding," in respect of houses is a relative term, I have endeavoured to represent roughly the size of the houses in each district, and also to point out those districts in which space for building was 4 still available, and, consequently, those in which future increase of population, and thus also an increasing mortality in future years may be anticipated. These are all most important particulars in estimating the causes of sickness and mortality. But there is another equally so ; I mean the social state of the persons inhabiting the several districts, and especially those elements of it which conduce to render the population comfortable or restricted in their circumstances, and careful or negligent in the use of the ordinary means of preserving their own health and that of their children. Roughly, again, I have endeavoured to represent this upon the Sanitary Map which accompanies my Report. No one can study the map, in conjunction with the table of death rates printed upon its face, without being struck with the importance of these particulars. I admit that they are not all of the local conditions which influence the health of the populations, still less their mortality : but they are all which are either at present at my hand, or which appear capable of being introduced without leading to confusion. I have designated each district by a trivial name. MORTALITY AND SICKNESS. 2. Two thousand nine hundred and forty-one persons (exclusive of strangers in hospitals) died in the Parish between January 1st and December 31st, inclusive. If we add to these, as we ought, our share of the deaths which hare taken place in various public institutions, receiving inmates from all parts, we must augment this number by 209, thus forming a total mortality of 3,150. Assuming our rate of increase last year to be the same as during the ten previous years, our population in the middle of the year would be 157,130. The death rate of the year then was 200 in each 10,000 persons. That of London at large is stated by the RegistrarGeneral to have been 232. 3. The births registered during the year amounted to 5,526, viz., 2,891 males and 2,635 females, as exhibited in the following table: 1861. West Sub-District. East Sub-District. Whole Parish. Males. Females Total. Males. Females Total. Males. Females Total. 1st Quarter 387 318 705 383 308 691 770 626 1396 2nd Quarter 372 362 734 323 332 655 695 694 1389 3rd Quarter 393 321 714 357 316 673 750 637 1387 4th Quarter 348 328 676 328 350 678 676 678 1354 Total 1500 1329 2829 1391 1306 2697 2891 2635 5526 4. Of the 2941 deaths of which I possess the particulars recorded in Table I. 1451 were of males, and 1490 of females. The table referred to exhibits the sex of those succumbing to each cause of death. One thousand four hundred and five of the deaths were of children under five years of age : they constituted thus 47.7 per cent, of the whole number of deaths. This is a somewhat smaller proportion than in the previous year, but the full value of the number cannot be estimated until the Census Tables are published, which will contain the population under five years of age. 5. From these numbers we are now in a position to calculate approximatively 5 the amount of sickness prevalent in Islington during the year by the application of the law recently laid down by Mr. Edmonds.* The law is, that "the numbers constantly suffering from acute sickness at any year of age (from 15 years upwards) will amount to double the number of yearly deaths, and the number of invalids or permanent sufferers from past sickness will be equal to the number of annual deaths." Consequently, during the past year in Islington, there were on an average constantly on the sick list, unable to work at their occupations, unable to gain their living, unproductive, thrown upon the resources of their former providence, upon the kindness and means of their friends, or compelled to seek relief from the poor rates, as many as 4119 adult persons,f of whom one-third, or 1373, were persons permanently disabled, who will never be able to support themselves again out of earnings of their mental or bodily labour. What proportion of our adult population this number forms will appear at some future time. Mr. Edmonds' law doe3 not apply to children, but it is to be observed that much of the permanent disability of adult age, and the liability to attacks of sickness which interfere with the working power of the adult, is a legacy of infantile disease. Here then is the significance of my mortality table. It means something more than that our population has been reduced by so many—it has a political and social meaning, which is capable of a money valuation. Every death of an adult is a money loss ; every sickness is a reduction of wealth, represents an additional burthen upon a family, often ill-fitted to bear it, or an imperative demand upon the purse of the ratepayer. Every one of the persons referred to is, on the estimate of Dr. Farr, disabled for an average period of 36 days, or loses one-tenth part of his yearly earnings in consequence of sickness. Adult sickness represents a ten per cent, income tax—a tax too which does nobody any good. The number of persons who (including a few prisoners) sought medical relief in our various charitable institutions, or from the Parish, amounted, with children' to 28,000. Another large number were recipients of charitable aid in general or special hospitals in various parts of London, and many were probably without medical advice altogether. Applying Dr. Farr's estimate to our adult population of all classes, probably over 40,000 adults (one fourth of our adult population) were more or less ill at some time during the year. DISTRICT MORTALITY AND SICKNESS. 6. The district mortality is represented in Table II., and its relation to the population of each district, or the death rate, is represented on the table printed upon the map. The former is constructed from the record which I keep of the deaths which occur annually in every house and street in the Parish, with their cause as returned to the Registrar. The latter table is replete with interest, not only to myself, as watching over the public health and seeking to remove local causes of ill health, but also to you, as showing how large an amount of the whole death and sickness in the Parish occurs amongst those whose position in life is nearest to pauperism; amongst those, "On the Statistic! of Health," by T. R. Edmonds, Esq., B.A. Appendix to Report of the Proceedings of the Fourth Session of the International Statistical Congress, p. 450. This does not include the persons, probably at least 600, who correspond to the deaths in Hospitals, etc., beyond the limits of the parish ; nor yet those, probably about 400, who correspond to the deaths in the workhouse. 6 therefore, who either themselves, or by their families and dependants, are the most likely to be driven by disease to take advantage of the charity of their neighbours, or to accept of relief from the poor rates. It is for the benefit of such as these, labourers, artisans, clerks, shopmen, and shopwomen, and their families, &c., that we seek to apply the resources of sanitary science, in their homes, in their workshops, at their trades, rather than of those whose social status permits greater liberty of selection, and whose means permit the use of sanitary luxuries. It is these, too, whom we ought to endeavour to instruct. The death rate for the whole Parish being 20-0 per 1000, that of the several sanitary districts I have set out varied from 8'5 in Hornsey Rise district to 33-5 in Balls-pond district. Assuming, with Dr. Farr, a mortality of 15 per 1000 as a standard mortality for a healthy district, there were ten out of the thirty-five districts in which it was lower than this, viz., Hornsey Rise, Hornsey Road, Tufnell, Market, Highbury Hill, Belle Isle, Rydon, Highgate Hill, Archway, and Park Street districts. The appearance of Belle Isle district in their list is remarkable and instructive. Its full significance, however, is at present hidden from us. The death rate from zymotic disease, and the large per centage of infant deaths would place this district much lower in the list: the former stands in striking contrast to the infant mortality of the other nine districts. Still it is observable that in 1360 this district (calculating its death rate upon the population of 1861) was low, only 15 2 per 1000. Yet it is inhabited mainly by a negligent population, the houses are mostly small, there are, on an average, three families in every two houses, and the land is badly drained, and wet during a great part of the year. Probably, the great redeeming feature in the locality is the detached and isolated manner in which most of the houses are built, the free circulation of air amongst them, and the consequent thorough dilution of atmospheric poisons. It is, however, possible that the low death rate for two years, contrasting so forcibly with that in the Bemerton district adjoining, may be only one of those accidents, the influence of which can only be rectified by an inquiry extending over a series of years. Time will show. Of the remaining districts in which the death rate exceeded 15 per 1000, there were 11 in which it exceeded the mean mortality of the Parish, in which it was above 20 per 1000. There was only one district, (Balls-pond) the death rate of which exceeded that of the entire of London, viz., 23 2: every other district was below this rate. The eleven districts were Theberton, Church, Lower Hollowav, Kingsland, Shepherdess (rapidly growing), St. Peter's, Lower Road, Bemerton, Battle Bridge, Irish Courts, and Balls-pond districts. Balls-pond district was nearly at the bottom of the list in 1860 ; what places it quite the lowest in 1861 appears at the first glance at the table. The deaths from zymotic diseases were nearly double those of any other district, the mortality under five years of age was 18 in the 1000 living at all ages, and the deaths from scarlet fever were only feebly approached by those in the Irish Courts, being nearly three times as many as those in any other district. On referring to my street list, I find that out of nineteen deaths from scarlet fever in this district, six occurred in five houses in Albion-place, three in two houses in Brunswick-place, and seven in six houses in Mildmay-street. Altogether 78 out of the 102 deaths registered as happening in this district from all causes occurred in these three streets, viz., 21 in Albion-place, of which nine were from zymotic diseases, and fourteen of children under five years of age ; 20 in Brunswick-place, out of which six 7 were from zymotic diseases, and ten under five years of age, and 17 in Mildmay-street, of which ten were from zymotic diseases, and twelve under five years of age. 7. In estimating the incapacitating sickness among working adults in any of these districts, we should only be introducing a trifling error, were we to calculate it on the mortality over five years of age; but we will allow for it by deducting oneninth for the deaths between five and fifteen years. From the record I keep, the method will be to deduct from the total mortality of a district the deaths under five years of age, and again one-ninth of the remainder, the number thus obtained, multiplied by three, will represent the incapacitating sickness found, on the average at any time during the year among its adult population. The districts will fall into a table, thus :— TABLE A.

The first group embraces the districts of which the numbers are not underlined in the map. The second group those with a more mixed population, singly underlined on the map ; and the third group those with a population mostly more or less poor, doubly underlined on the map. The smaller the proportion of families to one sick adult, the greater the amount of adult sickness in the families resident in the district. But I must, once for all, caution you not to conclude, from a table thus constructed, that the districts at the head of each list are therefore the most unhealthy. To do this would be a most grievous abuse of statistics. Such a conclusion might be reduced to an absurdity, since it would go to assert that comfortable circumstances, large airy houses, intelligence, education, and sanitary carefulness, are conducive to disease, while the reverse of all these is especially favourable to health. It is to be recollected that we are only dealing with the sickness among adults, and it requires no elaborate statistical enumeration to assure us of the notorious fact that, in the districts of the first group, districts occupied by the most well-to-do, the proportion of adult persons in a family, 8 including servants, unmarried sons and daughters, and other dependents,* together with the number of persons at an advanced age, is considerably larger than in the third group, where marriages are commonly contracted earlier in life, and, as some would say, less prudently, where the head of a family has as much as he can do barely to support his wife and children, and where the elderly members of families too oflen have to take refuge in the workhouse, the mortality of which is excluded from calculation in all my District Tables. The second group is intermediate between these two. Regarded thus, there will be no difficulty on the part of those who know our Parish well in believing that the third group is that which is the most uniform of all in its social and domestic character, and it is that which on all accounts interests us most in a sanitary point of view. 8. And in this third group there were probably to be found, at any moment during the last year, 1109 families in which one of their few working adult members was unable, on account of sickness, to assist in supporting the family which depended upon them for subsistence, and of these, one-third were persons not only unable to work, but who never will be able to work again. And considering the improvident habits of this class of people, the burthen of making up the deficiency from this cause has fallen mainly, directly or indirectly, upon the poor rates. If we only calculated the earnings of such people at a shilling a day, (and twice that amount would be nearer the truth,) the amount which it has been necessary to make up, either from this source or from private or public charity during the year could not have been less than i. 17,355. To this maybe added, at least, half as much again, for those parts of the districts of the 1st and 2nd groups as shelter a similar population. And even then we shall have arrived at an amount of loss which must be regarded as far below the truth. I do not say that all this sickness and all this public loss of money is due to causes over which a Vestry has control, but some of it is. Part is doubtless due to a damaged constitution arising out of a neglected infancy passed years ago under unsanitary conditions, part to the permanent ill health formerly contracted elsewhere, part to the construction of streets and courts in former times in older parts of the Parish, when the free circulation of air in and about them was the last thing it was thought of to provide, and when the air and light of heaven were taxed for the necessities of the state. But I do say emphatically, that much might have been avoided, and much money thus saved to the public purse, had these persons all of them been lodged in sweeter dwellings, had there been no crowding, even in the older houses, of whole families day and night into one solitary room, had they been always fed with wholesome food, had their workshops, both here and elsewhere, been provided with proper sanitary appliances, had their trades been carried on with the precautions necessary for the avoidance of trade diseases, had they been instructed in the value of fresh air, both in their dwellings and workshops, both by day and by night, had they been taught to estimate personal and domestic cleanliness, and supplied with public and private means of maintaining it, and had they all been impressed with the fallacy of the notions which drive so many to seek oblivion in drink, of their anxieties, unhappiness, and of the discomfort and misery of their homes. I * That this is the case, comes out remarkably on calculating the proportion of females (the more dependent sex) to every ten families in the groups of sanitary districts. In the 1st group it varies from 20.0 to 37.9 to ten families, the mean being 29.5 .. 2nd 19.4 to 28.6 22.8 .. 3rd 20.1 to 26.3 21.6 9 know I am sketching an Utopia—an ideal condition of society among the labouring classes. But this ideal we must place before us, or—nothing. We must aim at perfection, even though it may be impracticable to reach it. Every illness we prevent, in any class of society, is, to take the most sordid view, a public economy. INFANT MORTALITY. 9. The children who died in the Parish under 5 years of age were 1405. Of these 748 had not reached the termination of the first year of their existence. I do not know, as I have at present no means of calculating, what proportion these 1405 bear to the number of children within the age of 5 years living in the Parish, but it is apparent that as there were 35,230 families in the Parish on the 8th of April, one in every 25 of these lost a child by death during the year. Again, as there were 5355 children* under one year of age, born in the parish and alive at some time during the year, it may be estimated that about every 7th of'them died before their first year of life was out. The unregistered births, and the probably small number coming at that age into the Parish with their parents from elsewhere, might make this proportion somewhat smaller, but not much. I am not going to enter at length into the causes of this mortality, as I did so in a former report; I shall merely refer you to the mortality table for information, simply saying that some of them were purposely killed directly, others were killed indirectly, while the majority fell victims to maternal ignorance, to neglect, to improper feeding, and to those numerous unhealthy influences of habitation, which, with inherited feebleness of constitution, if they do not always originate disease, unquestionably impress upon it a fatal tendency. 10. It has long been held by Sanitarians that the infant mortality of a district is about the best index of its unhealthiness or the reverse. Let us see what we can discover as to the sanitary condition of the several districts into which 1 have divided our Parish, in respect to this matter. Compared with the population at all ages, there were in the Parish at large 9.0 in every 1000 carried off while under the age of 5 years. If you consult the table on the map you will see how differently this mortality was distributed throughout the several districts. In some it was only 1.8, 2.9, 3.6, 3.7 in the 1000 who died thus young. In others the number varied from 10 to 18 in the 1000. Doubtless, the same explanation as we offered in respect to adult sickness and mortality may be put forward, and will have a certain amount of truth on its side, viz:—that while the adults are in larger proportion in the wealthier districts, so the infants are in smaller proportion when compared with the poorer; but is it credible that in the extremes of the two classes there is a difference, such as exist between 1 and 10, or even 1 and 5 ? Probably before the period of my next Report I shall have some definite information on this point, one on which it is of the highest importance I should be informed. In the mean time, I have instituted a limited inquiry as to the proportion of children under 5 years in several streets occupied by the labouring classes, and I find them to amount to about 20 per cent of the entire population of those streets, that is, out of a population of 4759, there were 981 children under 5 years of age. At the census of 1851, the children under 5 years of age formed about 12 per cent of the entire population of the Parish. In these same streets 83 children died during the year under 5 years of age, being about 17 per 1000 of the whole population, and 84 per 1000 of the population under 5 years. In some of the * The number of children (Islington-torn) living in the parish under one year of age, is obtained by taking the mean of the births in 1860-61. 10 streets entering into this enumeration the mortality was last year much higher than I have stated. Thus in Nel on Place, Nelson Buildings, and Nelson Cottages, City Road, it was at the rate of 187* per 1000; in Halton Place, 161 per 1000; in Newhall Street, 140 per 1000; in Albany Place, Queen's Road, 173 per 1000; in Bemerton Street, 106 per 1000; in Clayton Street, 112 per 1000 of those living under 5 years of age. There is another way of regarding this mortality, we may compare it with the number of families in the several districts. TABLE B.

Thus, we have at the two extremes, Hornsey Rise presenting us with only one infant death in every 94.6 families, and the Irish courts showing one in every 127 families, and Balls Pond in every 12.9 families. In the first group we have the infant deaths ranging from one death in 94.6 to one in 25 families, with a mean of one in every 36.3 families; in the second group from one in every 55.6 to one in every 17.4 families, with a mean of one in every 29.2 families; and in the third group, ranging from one in every 27.8 to one in every 12.7 families, with a mean of one in every 19 3 families; and it is to be recollected that it is home conditions which, above The continuance of such a death rate as this would involve the almost entire extinction of the rising generation in the course of five years; or, in other words, that there would he almost no increase of population by the births occurring there. 11 all, regulate infant health. Where I find a high infant mortality, it is to that street or district my principal attention is always directedfor the discovery and removal of local conditions of ill health, the abatement of overcrowding, dirt, and the occupation of kitchens as sleeping rooms. 11. And in respect to kitchen occupation, I have a word to say about two of the districts in the first group. It will be observed that Shepherdess and Mildmay districts stand very high in their infant mortality, and last year they stood nearer in character to some of the better districts in the third group than to some of the worst in their own. I do not wish it to be understood that the practice I am about to mention is the main cause of this, but it is well known that most of the new houses in these districts are constructed with what are termed breakfast parlours in the basement, otherwise, what would be front kitchens are metamorphosed into sittingrooms, in which the younger members of the family spend much of the day. This practice is reprehensible. Such rooms are usually impurfectly ventilated; if there be any dampness in the house, it is there that it will be found, and if there are any noxious exhalations from the drains or foundation of the bouse it is there that they will be most concentrated. When visiting sick persons in houses thus arranged, and also when making official visits to them, I have constantly taken the opportunity of expressing this opinion in private by way of warning; I now state it publicly. From what I have myself seen of the use of such rooms, I am satisfied that the health of the children would be better were it abandoned. CAUSES OF DEATH. a. Zymotic Causes. 12. Of the 2,941 deaths recorded in Table I, 846 were attributed to these causes directly; and of the 1405 deaths of infants, 603 were thus referred. The number is high; it is due manly to the prevalence of scarlet fever and hooping cough, and to the larger number of deaths from bowel complaints, consequent upon a summer temperature higher than the average. Referred to the several districts the deaths occurred thus :— TABLE C. Showing the Proportion of Families to each Death from a Zymotic Cause in the several Sanitary Districts or Groups of Districts.

Of course, considering how large a proportion of zymotic disease occurs among young children, we must, in drawing conclusions from these tables, keep in mind that there is a difference in the several districts and groups of districts in the child population: but, taken in conjunction with the other tables, it will assist us greatly in our judgment as to the healthiness or unhealthiness of the several districts during the past year, and the more, because zymotic disease is not confined to ages under 5 years. Small Pox.—The deaths from this disease have dwindled down to six. In 1859-60, it will be recollected, that an epidemic carried off 51 persons. Measles.—The mortality from measles has been low—only 46 deaths having occurred against an average of 85 in the previous five year Scarlet Fever has prevailed to a great extent. Two hundred and eighty-one cases were attended by the parochial officers and obtained charitable aid from the dispensaries. One hundred and fifty-two deaths are recorded as having resulted from it during the year. from it during the year. from it during the year. The districts where the mortality was highest were the following thirteen:— Belonging to which Group. District. Deaths from Scarlet Fever. No. of Families to one Death. iii Balls Pond 19 37.3 iii Irish Courts 4 54.0 i Market 7 109.2 ii Church 6 114.3 ii Rother field 12 119.5 i Barns bury 15 122.9 ii Theberton 152.1 i Mildmay 170.0 ii Trinity 8 172.4 iii Lower Road 9 180.8 iii City Road 14 188.2 ii Kingsland 4 242.1 i Shepherdess 5 242.1 Total 112 132.5 In the following districts there was not a single death from scarlet fever, viz:— in group 1—Hornsey Rise, Rydon, Duncan; in group 2—Highgate Hill, Park Street, Palmer, and Highbury Vale. Not one of the districts in group 3 escaped more or less mortality from scarlet fever. As to the above table, there are certain points worthy of observation :—1. That when we consider the highly infectious nature of scarlet fever, and the high probability of its spreading to all in a family who are predisposed by youth, or who are unprotected by a former attack, we may regard these districts not only as those where the highest mortality occurred from the disease, but also where it was most prevalent, and this in the order in which they stand. 2. That more than two-thirds of all the deaths from scarlet fever during the year occurred in these districts, which are all adjoining one another, at the south and south-eastern border of the parish, 3. That it prevailed in this locality irrespectively 13 of the character of the population, but at the same time the mortality was highest in two of the lowest districts, viz.:—Balls Pond and the Irish courts. The greatest number of deaths altogether occurred in the 4th quarter of the year. Whooping Cough —Either immediately, or by its complications, carried off 209 children, 132 of whom were under 2 years of age. The mortality was highest in the following twelve districts, viz :— Belonging to which Group. Districts. No. of Deaths from Whooping Cough. No. of Families to one Death. iii Battle Bridge 10 54.7 iii Queen's Road 8 92.1 iii Canal 26 92.3 iii Balls Pond 6 118.2 iii Bemerton 24 118.4 iii White Conduit 5 127.4 i Mildmay 4 127.5 ii Kingsland 9 130.3 ii Theberton 9 135.2 i Shepherdess 10 145.3 ii St. Peter's 10 150.4 ii Rotherfield 9 159.3 Total 130 11.6 This disease differed from scarlet fever in its more universal prevalence throughout the Parish. The mortality spared only four of the districts, viz :—Hornsey Rise, Rydon, and Duncan, belonging to the 1st group, and Irish Courts belonging to the 3rd group. It is remarkable that the Irish Courts in 1860 had no fatal case of whooping cough. 1st, this, like scarlet fever, being a remarkably contagious disease and affecting chiefly the very youngest children in a family, among whom also it is most fatal, we may consider the table as representing also the prevalence of the disease; 2nd, the disease was most fatal in those families which resided in some of the lowest districts, the first six in the district enumerated belonging to the 3rd group. It selected, in fact, some of the most crowded districts in the Parish, and (with the extraordinary exception of the Irish Courts) spared none altogether but the best and least crowded. Fever.—The number of deaths returned as from fever was 89, the same number as occurred in 1856. Bowel complaints, diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera, together, carried off 153 persons. The corrceted mean for 5 years is 134 ; of these, 131 were under 5 years of age, and 100 under 1 year, infants then who should have been at the breast. The mortality was highest in the following districts:—White Conduit, Irish Courts, Rolherfield, Shepherdess, Bemerton, Freehold, and Battle Bridge. b. Constitutional Diseases. 13. The tubercular diseases are the most important of this class, they carried off 478 persons, or 3 out of every 1000 of the population, Of these 158 were infants. From Phthisis in particular there were 329 deaths. 14 c. Local Diseases. 14. The diseases embraced under this head constitute a group of maladies, thrown together rather from considerations of convenience than because they are naturally or pathologically allied. Some of them, such as diseases of the respiratory organs, acknowledge very much an atmospheric origin, and vary with temperature, prevailing winds, and other conditions beyond our control. At the same time, a glance at the table on the map will show how much more the less wealthy of our population suffer from the effects of these conditions, partly in consequence of inability to provide themselves with the needful protection of their persons from cold, wet, &c., and partly from the neglect of adopting for their children the ordinary precautions which the better educated classes usually observe. The mortality for the parish at large from disease of the organs of respiration was 457, or 2-9 per 1000 living. In the several districts the rate of mortality varied from 0-4 per 1000 to 7'6 per 1000. The districts which furnished the highest mortality were in order as follows :—Irish Courts, Balls-pond, Theberton, Bemerton, Battle Bridge, Church, Duncan, Lower Road, Lower Holloway, White Conduit, and Kingsland. As to the other groups of this class, viz., disease of the nervous system, and of the digestive system, I may say, that so far as infants are concerned, the mortality is mainly the result of ignorant and improper feeding, and no small proportion referred to " convulsions" would, if the history of the disease were forthcoming, be assigned as its cause to " privation of breast-milk." Among adults the natural changes of advancing age are too often accelerated by intemperance and the wear and tear of ceaseless toil and anxiety. Both with a view to lessen the mortality from these groups of maladies, as well as from consumption, it is the duty of a sanitary officer, by the expression of his opinion, to encourage and commend all efforts for the abridgement of the hours of work, especially of desk, of office, and of shop-work, any rational and practicable scheme that may be proposed for diminishing Sunday labour, for promoting healthy recreations, for providing public parks, and for facilitating access to the quiet and soothing influence of the country. For our own Parish, I regret yearly the slow progress of the scheme for providing such an invaluable health-resort for our population as the Finsbury Park promised to become. SANITARY WORKS OF THE YEAR. 15. The illness of one of our Inspectors, which ultimately necessitated the appointment of a temporary inspector for the western division, who had all his work to learn, has somewhat impeded our sanitary progress. Nevertheless Table V. will show that a large amount of work has been got through. There were 654 complaints entered in the Complaint Book for Nuisances during the year, all which were attended to, in addition to those inspections made under my direction on account of prevalent sickness, or an inordinate death rate. The slaughter houses were all inspected in September, by the Inspectors, and also prior to the licensing, by myself. There were 110 of them, 52 in the western and 58 in the eastern division. I was much gratified by the improved condition which they generally presented, and which contrasted strongly with what appeared on the first inspection which I made in 1857. The plan of licensing is acting most satisfactorily ; the newly-built slaughter houses especially, with but few exceptions, were models of what such places ought to be. I 15 look forward with hope, therefore, to the proposed exlenfion of the system to the cow-sheds, although by no means clear as to the pro[ riety or necessity of such establishments in crowded neighbourhoods being permitted at all. Five seizures of meat have been made in butchers' shops, and one qf several legs of mutton, floured and sold as "Dartmoor mutton." Such meat should always be regarded with suspicion, especially when offered for sale at a comparatively low price. Three of these cases were so bad as to demand their being taken to the police court, and while the meat was in each case condemned, the Magistrate, in one case, inflicted a fine of 40s. and costs. The total weight of meat seized was 313 lbs. Several rabbits, and lots of fish and fruit have also been seized and destroyed. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your very obedient Servant, EDWARD BALLARD, M.D., M.R.C.P., etc. Medical Officer of Health. Vestry Offices, May lst, 1862. TABLE I.
