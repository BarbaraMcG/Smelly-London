THE FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE Health, Sanitary Condition, Etc., Etc., OF THE DISTRICT OF WOOLWICH, FOR THE YEAR 1893, BY WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., D.Sc., F.RS.Ed., Barrister-at-Law, Professor of Forsenic Medicine in King's College, London, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. WOOLWICH: F. J. CATTERMOLE, PRINTER, ARTILLERY PLACE. 1894. Town Hall. Woolwich, 2nd April, 1894. To the Chairman and Members of the Woolwich Local Board of Health. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report upon the sanitary condition of Woolwich during the year 1893. Mortality There have been 848 deaths, of this number 401 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 417 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. The gross death rate for the year, estimated upon a population of 41854 1s 20.2 per thousand. Of these deaths 176 took place in various Medical Institutions (Table 7) outside the district, in the appended statistical tables they have however been allotted to their proper registration sub-districts, and calculated as if taking place within the sanitary area of Woolwich. Twenty deaths occurring within the district were of persons not rightly belonging to Woolwich, if these be deducted from the total deaths, the correct number of deaths occurring in Woolwich during the twelve months ending the 31st December, 1893, will be obtained, viz., 828. Death Rate. The corrected death-rate is therefore 19.7 per thousand, as against 19.5 in 1892, and 21.6 in 1891. I have appended tables (Nos. 9 and 10) which shows comparatively the position taken by Woolwich in this respect as regards other large towns, and the various Metropolitan Sanitary Districts, 4 Of the total deaths 315 were of children under 5 years of age, and 533 of persons above that age; of the 315 children 210 were infants under one year of age. In Table 5 will be found a comparison of the deaths occurring in the Sanitary District of Woolwich during the years 1892 and 1893, distinguishing those under 5 years of age and those over 5 years. Zymotic Death Rate The deaths from all causes during the year included 3 From small pox 10 from isfluenze, 14 from measles, 15 from scarlet fever, 6 from diphtheria, 3 from croup, 20 from whooping cough, 5 from typhoid fever, and 33 from diarrhoea, in all 109 deaths from diseases classified by the Registrar General as specific febrile or zymotic, this is equivalent to a zymotic death rate of 2.60 per thousand, in 1892 it was 2.4 per thousand, in 1891 it was 2.86 per thousand. The deaths from diphtheria and croup are slightly in exccss of those from the same causes last year, those from whooping cough and diarrhoea are greatly in excess of those from similar causes, the deaths from diarrhoea were mainly amongst children under 5 years of age; these two latter diseases are principally responsible for this year's zymotic death rate. The deaths from typhoid fever are less than those in 1892 ; in this latter year there were sixteen, in 1893 five. Small pox caused three deaths in 1893, in 1892 not any. Other The causes of the remaining deaths will be seen on reference to the appended tables, and perhaps call for no special comment with the exception of those found in Classes IV. and VI., Table 1. Phthisis mortality, etc. In Class IV., 121 deaths are recorded as arising from tubercular disease, viz., 16 from tabes mesenterica, 10 from tubercular meningitis and hydrocephalus, 87 from phthisis, and 8 from other forms of tuberculosis or scrofula; of these deaths 52 occurred in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 69 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District; the deaths in the Arsenal Sub-District from these causes, although proportionately not so great as in 1892, still show an excess over those in the Dockyard Sub-District. 5 In 1890 there were 126 snch deaths, in 1891 139 deaths, in 1892 112, so that those in 1893 are in excess of those in 1892. In Class VI., including the deaths from Laryngitis and Croup, there will be found to be 168 deaths, 83 of which were in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District, and 85 in the Arsenal Registration Sub-District. In 1891 there were 208 of such deaths, in 1892 there were 188. In previous reports I have laid stress upon the importance of the statistical evidence of the mortality from consumption, and pointed out that as this indicates a high or low mortality, so a far more accurate idea of the healthiness or unhealthiness of a place can be obtained than perhaps from any other source. It is greatly to be regretted that in the past attention has not been given to this subject, and measures enforced for the prevention and the remedy of dampness in the houses of the district. I would again seriously impress upon the notice of the Sanitary Authority the necessity for the adoption of prompt and adequate measures to remedy this evil wherever found. Sex mortality. Of the total deaths in the Arsenal Registration SubDistrict, there were 229 males and 218 females, in the Dockyard Registration Sub-District 217 males and 184 females, or in other words, of the 848 total deaths, 446 were of males, and 402 of females. 145 deaths were of persons over 65 years of age. Births and Birth Rate. The number of births registered during the year was 1312 as against 1236 in 1892, 1336 in 1891, and 1241 in 1890. Of these births 26 were registered as illegitimate. The birthrate is therefore 31.3. Marriages. There have been 614 marriages registered during the year, as against 599 in 1892, 524 in 1891, and 476 in 1890. Inquests and Suicides. There have been 62 inquests. There have been 6 cases of suicide, viz., 2 from cut throat, and 1 each by drowning, hanging, shooting, and being run over by train. 6 Mortuary. 39 bodies were received into the mortuary, of which 28 were resident in the district, and 16 non-resident. Infectious Diseases. During the year 426 cases have been notified, as follows Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlet Fever 146 113 259 Small-pox 45 16 61 Erysipelas 30 16 46 Typhoid fever 16 9 25 Diphtheria 16 8 24 Puerperal fever 3 1 4 Continued fever 1 2 3 Membraneous croup 2 2 Cholera 2 2 261 165 426 Of these 426 cases, 196 were removed to Hospital, as follows Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. Total. Scarlct fever 64 57 121 Small-pox 42 16 58 Typhoid fever 9 4 13 Diptheria 3 3 Continued fever 1 1 119 77 196 It is with much satisfaction that I note that a larger proportion of the cases notified have been removed to Hospital, and it is to be hoped that the great privilege of gratuitous treatment in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board will be more and more availed of by those who unfortunately have infectious disease present in their families. It is impossible to over estimate the value of such a proceeding to the patients themselves, for the advantage of skilled medical treatment both by night and by day, in well equipped and 7 properly ventilated wards, will be at once admitted, but further, great discomfort and inconvenience in the hone will be prevented, and the necessity for restricting the movements of the non-infected members of the family avoided. Again, the community at large is benefited by the removal of the infectious sick to proper isolation hospitals for the risk of general infection is diminished, and for this reason the maintenance of such patients in the various Infectious Institutions should be a charge on the rates, and as with education,— which is state provided, and so free to all,—so with treatment in the Asylums Board Hospitals, these institutions being provided and maintained out of the rates, the privilege of treatment in them should be free to all who choose to avail themselves of it. The notifications in 1893 were less than in the previous year owing to the decrease in the number of scarlet fever cases ; in 1892 there were 425 notifications, in 1891 129 cases were notified, and in 1890 106 cases. The usual steps for arresting the spread of the infections disease were taken in every case, and I have to record with much satisfaction the cordial way in which my medical brethren have worked with me for the general benefit of the district. I cannot recall a single instance since I have had the honour of being Medical Officer for Woolwich of the slightest friction with any of the medical practitioners in any respect whatever, and I am sure your Board will accord them your thanks for their valued co-operation in promoting the health interests of the district. The two cases of cholera notified, on enquiry ,wcre not found to be of tho true Asiatic type. Cholera Precaution. Proper steps were taken for dealing with any outbreak of this disease if it had occurred, both in the direction of providing proper medical and nursing treatment, and in the provision of litters and hospital accommodation, this latter being again found in the Woolwich Infirmary. s Small Pox It will be noted that this district has been visited during the year with several outreaks of small-pox, the cases were notified as follows:— Arsenal Sub-District. Dockyard Sub-District. February 1 March 17 1 April 1 2 May 11 4 June 2 5 July 3 1 August 2 October 4 1 November 1 1 December 4 45 16 From the above figures it will be seen that the disease has never assumed an epidemic form, although repeatedly introduced into the district, more particularly through the medium of common lodging houses, this desirable result being obtained by the energy of the Sanitary Inspectors, by the co-operation of the Public Vaccinator, and the readiness of the lodging-house keepers to render every assistance, and their willingness to adopt such measures as the non-rcception of new inmates, which obviously operated to their own pecuniary loss Typhoid Fever Of the 25 cases of typhoid fever, no less than 6 occurred in one house, and two additional cases have occurred since, the dates of the notification of these latter cases were as under:— One case on 6th December, 1893. „ „ 14th „ „ Four cases on 21st„ „ One case on 19th January, 1894. „ „ 24th„ „ There can be no doubt that a local cause was in operation. Every investigation was made; the drainage arrangements, although defective, could not be held to be accountable, the water supply was good, and the milk was not implicated. Many of the cases occurred in connection with the front basement room which was used as a living room. 9 The house was built on a made soil, and the basement was dark and ill ventilated, the stairs leading from the ground floor to the basement being quite dark. In this case the Sanitary Authority, acting upon my advice, desired the introduction of a window at the head of the staircase, which would give facilities for admitting both light and air. It is known as a scientific fact that light is inimical to the growth of the Typhoid organism—the Magistrate before whom the summons was heard, held, however, that light was not necessary—and that the air could be admitted to the basement by making the pane of glass over the front door of the ground floor to open. Disinfection. 8330 articles of clothing, bedding, etc., have been disinfected, a number considerably in excess of the previous year. I have to record with satisfaction the steps taken by your Board to provide proper conveyances for the removal of infected and noninfected bedding, etc., two waggons of an improved pattern having been ordered for this purpose, one for removing the infected clothing, bedding, etc., from the infected house to the disinfecting chamber, the other for conveying back the clothing, bedding, etc., after disinfection. In some cases it was necessary to give compensation, notably in certain small-pox cases, where the bedding, etc., were destroyed. Sickness Returns. I append a table giving the returns from various sources for the year (Table 9). House to House Inspection. During the year the Inspectors have visited 3052 houses, and made 2780 re-inspections, these inspections necessitating the issuing of 1554 notices—in the great majority of cases these were complied with. Common Lodging Houses There are 36 common lodging houses, showing a decrease of four since my last report. These houses are as a rule well conducted, and the proprietors have shown a desire in every way to co-operate with the sanitary officials. The Home Secretary has intimated his intention of transferring the control of these houses from the Police to the London County Council. In my opinion there was no necessity for this change, and 10 if considered necessary the transfer should have been made to the Local Sanitary Authority, and not to the County Council. In Woolwich, as in all other Metropolitan Districts, the control of common lodging houses, slaughter houses, and cowsheds, is in the hands of a body other than the Local Sanitary Authority, a condition of things not existing in the smallest provincial borotigh. Slaughter Houses There are 8 licensed Slaughter Houses in the district. I would again express the hope that at no very distant date the necessity for these may cease, and that in the interest of all classes we niay have a public abattoir where the slaughtering of animals may take place, and where systematic inspection of the meat supply of the town can be made. Cow Sheds, Milk Shope &c. There are three licensed cow sheds in this district, these, together with the milkshops, have been regularly inspected. Bake Houses. There are 37 bakehouses in Woolwich. Although for the most part the regulations have been generally observed, there can be no doubt that many of these places are totally unfit for the purpose they are put to, tho difficulties, however, in di aling with such are manifest, as it would involve serious interference with trade interests, which cannot always be fully justified. Rag and Bone Shops These have been regularly visited, and have called for no special action on the part of the officials, The Market. The Market has been visited on many occasions by myself, and systematically both by night and day by the Inspectors. Occasionally it has been found neccssary to seize food as unfit for human consumption. Dust Collection. This most important branch of sanitary work has been carried on most satisfactorily during the year. Housing of Working Classes Act. The number of houses dealt with under this statute is necrssarily Jess than in previous years. I append, however, a table which gives particulars of houses dealt with since the Act passed in 1890 (Table 17). 11 Bye Laws. The various Bye-Laws required by the Public Healths (London) Act have now been put in force in the district, with the exception of those dealing with houses let in lodgings, the revision of the old Bye-Laws relative to which are now occupying your attention. Sanitary and other I'm provements. The past year has been singularly fruitful in the provision of many and great sanitary and other improvements, by which the District has greatly benefitted. 1. The War Office has issued an order amending their rules as regard pay to their employees in the Arsenal, in the event of infectious disease being present in their families, as follows:— INFECTIOUS DISEASES. "All persons employed in the Ordance Factories are prohibited "from coining to their work when small-pox, scarlet fever, or other "serious infectious disease is present in their families, or in the house "in which they reside. Any person violating this order will subject "himself to dismissal. When infectious disease is present in the "house of any employee he should at once report the circumstance "to the Medical Officer of the Factory, and take steps for the "isolation or removal of the patient to a hospital, or his own removal "to other quarters. To cover the time required for making such "arrangements, and for necessary disinfection, full pay will be "allowed for a period not exceeding one week, on the certificate of "the Medical Officer of the Factory that the man was necessarily "absent. On the expiration of the week the issue of pay will cease, "but the man mast continue to absent himself from work until such " time as he may be declared by the Medical Officer of the Factory " to be free from infection. " This Regulation applies to all Foremen and others ranking as " such, and persons of higher rank." This new rule met with a certain amount of opposition, and a petition was forwarded to the Secretary of State for War relative to the matter. His reply was as follows:— Wab Office, Pali. Mail, S.W., 3rd March, 1894. "Sir,— I am directed by the Secretary of State for War to "acquaint yon that, in connection with the Memorial which 'accompanied yonr letter of the 23rd November last, he has had " under consideration the operation of Rule 41 of the Regulations " of the Ordance Faotories, as promulgated on the 8th August last. 12 "I am to observe that this Rule was adopted by the Secretary of "State after repeated and urgent representation of the Local "Government Authorities through the Local Government Board. "These representations shewed clearly that the former rule, under "which half pay was issued during the whole period of a man's "absence through infection in his house, tended to defeat the objects "of the Legislature, which by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, "54 and 55 Vict., cap. 76, empowered the sanitary authorities to "provide hospital accommodation for the isolation of persons suffer"ing from infectious disease. "The new Rule has now been in operation six months, and the "Secretary of State has already received testimony to its value in "aiding the Local authorities in the isolation of infectious disease, "and he is not prepared to sanction its repeal. "It has, however, been brought to Mr. Campbell-Bannerman's "notice that in a few cases hardship has been occasioned by the "compulsory absence of men in cases where an infected person "could not be removed on account of insufficient hospital accom. "modation. In such cases, where properly certified by the local "authorities, he has directed that the operation of the new Rule bo "relaxed." "I am, Sir, your obedient servant, "WM. WOODALL. The old rule undoubtedly tended to the retention in the district of infectious cases, the government grant being supplemented by contributions from one or more infectious sick clubs. 2. The Metropolitan Asylums Board have decided to erect a Fever Hospital at Shooter's Hill, on a site adjoining the Herbert Hospital. This cannot fail to be a very great boon for Woolwich and the adjoining districts. In the past we have frequently suffered from want of hospital provision, and a further disadvantage has been the distance of the nearest fever hospital, viz., the South Eastern Hospital from Woolwich. The necessity for such provision is more than ever urgent in view of the recent War Office circular, to which I have alluded, A most determined opposition was, however, given to the erection of a hospital on this site, both by the War Office and by certain residents on Shooters' Hill. 13 The opposition was both unreasonable and illogical, and could not prevail against the unanimous support given to the scheme by the various local authorities, and the testimony of the whole of the Medical Officers of Health of the District as to the urgent need of such a hospital, and the great eligibility of the site proposed. The Local Government Board allowed the purchase of the site, imposing certain restrictions on the erection of the buildings, one being to the effect that no wards should be placed within 450 feet of the Shooters' Hill Road; this restriction has been found in no way to hamper the erection of a proper hospital, the plans for which have now been approved, and which represent the most complete hospital of its kind in tho world. 3. The laying out of the North Woolwich Gardens has been completed, and they now form one of the plcasantest recreation grounds in the Metropolis. 4. The Communication between North and South Woolwich has been f arther improved by the placing on the river of a new ferry boat, "The Hutton." The following are the number of passengers and vehicles that have passed over the ferry during the past three years:— Passengers. Vehicles. 1891 3,981,976 230,362 1892 3,753,144 254,960 1893 3,495,362 261,462 Total 11,230,482 746,784 5. The alterations have been commenced at the Woolwich yard, with the view of laying it out as an open space. 6. The Board has resolved to remove all trade refuse, and dispose of it in the destructor. 7. The Electric Light has been introduced into Woolwich. In all these respects the district has been greatly benefitted, and the town is indebted to its Local Authority for its enlightened policy. There are one or two things which in my judgment require the immediate attention of the Board. 14 1. The erection of an underground convenience in Beresford Square, adequate for the requirements of tho district, and on the lines of the admirable structures in other parts of the Metropolis. 2. The provision of clerical assistance in the Sanitary Department. This duty, which is now thrown upon the Sanitary Inspectors, interferes greatly with the discharge of their proper duties; the work in this respect, even during the past two years has doubled itself, and every year brings additional labour for kesping fresh books and making returns. 3. The necessity for taking steps to extend the provisions of the Infectious Disease Notification Act to the Woolwich Garrison. In supporting the proposition to erect a Fever Hospital, it came to my knowledge that the whole of the Western Pavilion of the Herbert Hospital was used for the reception for fever cases, and that this was in many ways directly connected with the main building, whilst the kitchen arrangements, etc., of the Hospital wore common to all. I understand also that during the year 1893 there have been in connection with the Woolwich Garrison, the following eases of infectious disease:— Scarlet Fever— Men 105 Women and children 73 — 178 Diphtheria — Men 1 Women and children 3 — 4 Exteric Fever— Men 3 — 3 Puerperal Fever— Women 1 — 1 Measles— Women and children 59 — 59 Total 215 245 15 In my judgment this amount of infections disease in the district of which we know nothing is a serious menance to the health of the inhabitants, between whom and the military there is, of course, much inter-communication, and calls for immediate attention and remedy; and further, it has come to my knowledge that, the Military Authorities are without any proper means for the disinfection of infected clothing, which fact, taken in conjunction with the large amount of Infectious Disease present in the Garrison during the year 1893, represents a state of things which is of grave moment in the interests of the town. In conclusion, I have again to record my acknowledgments of the kindness and consideration I have received from your Board, and more particularly from that committee with whom I am the most closely connected, to the Chairman of which, and its members, I beg to accord my thanks. My acknowledgments arc also due to the Clerk and the Surveyor for very willing help on every occasion I have required their services. Inspectors Carty, Mackie, and Woolley have continued to discharge their duties with zeal and assiduity—Inspector Mackie, as in previous years, has rendered very valuable service in the discharge of clerical duties, frequently at great personal inconvenience; to him my thanks are more particularly due. Very many and great changes have taken place in Woolwich during the past four years, having for their object the improvement of the health, and the promotion of the comfort and well-being of its inhabitants. These changes have been accomplished with singularly little friction, and it is a matter for congratulation, I am sure, to all, that in these respects Woolwich occupies a very foremost position amongst the Sanitary Districts of the Metropolis. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WILLIAM R. SMITH, M.D., D.Sc., F.R.S., Edin., Medical Officer of Health, and Public Analyst for Woolwich. 16 THE SANITARY COMMITTEE of THE WOOLWICH LOCAL BOARD OF HEALTH. Mr. R.
