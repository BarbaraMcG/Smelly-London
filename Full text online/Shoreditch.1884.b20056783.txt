PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO TEE 18th & 19th VIC, CAP., 120. LONDON: A. T. Roberts Son & Co., Steam Printing Works, 5, Hackney Road, E. 1885. A REPORT On the Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities of the Vestry of the Parish of Saint Leonard, Shoreditch, and of the proceedings of the Vestry, and of the Works undertaken and executed, &c., and of the Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended Lady-day, 1885. Published pursuant to the " Metropolis Local Management Acts." SHOREDITCH. The Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, is situate entirely within the County of Middlesex. It is bounded on the east by Bethnal Green, Spitalfields and Norton Folgate, on the north by Hackney, on the west by Islington and St. Luke's, while its southern boundary is immediately contiguous to that of the City of London ; its length, from north to south, is about 1¾ miles, its breadth, from east to west, is nearly 1½ miles, and its superficial area is about 640 acres. The parish is classed in Schedule A in the Metropolis Local Management Act, and consequently returns two members to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The Vestry consists of 120 elected Members, and meets on the 1st and 3rd Tuesdays in each month for the transaction of its general business; other and Special Meetings are held as circumstances or occasion require. The Parish is divided for Yestry purposes into eight wards, the boundaries of which are as follows :— The following four Wards form the. Hoxton Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Shoreditch :— No. 1—Moorfields Ward.—All that part of the Parish lying South of a line commencing at the Bethnal Green boundary in Bethnal Green Road (Church Street); and continuing through Church Street, New Inn Yard, and Leonard Street, to St. Luke's Boundary. No. 2.—Church Ward.—North of the line above described. The Eastern Boundary commences at the corner of Boundary Street, Bethnal Green Road, and continues by Boundary Street to Austin Street, Hackney Road, thence to Kingsland Road, and by that Road to Mary Street; crosses Hoxton Street to Great James Street, thence by St, John's Road and Pitfield Street to Old Street, thence westward through Old Street, and thence by the boundary of St. Luke's to Leonard Street. 6 no. 3 Hoxton Ward.—West and North of the Boundary of Church Ward. The Northern Boundary of this Ward commences at the St. John's Road end of Nicholas Street, through that street to the New North Road, Murray Street, Shepherdess Walk and Edward Street to the St. Luke's Boundary, and thence by that boundary, near the City Road, until it intersects the Church Ward Boundary in Old Street. No. 4—Wenlock Ward.—North and West of the Hoxton Boundary. The Eastern Boundary commences at the New North Road, corner of Nicholas Street, thence by Mintern Street and Bridport Place, over the Rosemary Branch Bridge, and thence by the Islington and St. Luke's Boundaries, the Canal, Wharf Road, &c., to the Boundary of Hoxton Ward in Edward Street. The following four Wards form the Haggerston Division of the Parliamentary Borough of Shoreditch :— No, 5—Whitmore Ward.—All that part North of Church Ward, and East of Wenlock Ward, and West of a line commencing at Kingsland Road, by the end of Mary Street, and continuing a few yards over the Bridge. The Parish of Hackney is the Northern Boundary. No. 6—Kingsland Ward.—The line commences at the point of Kingsland and Hackney Roads, opposite Shoreditch Church, and continuing by Hackney Road to Brunswick Street, thence to the Regent's Canal, thence by the Canal to Kingsland Road, and by that Road to the point at Shoreditch Church. No. 7—Haggerstone Wabd.—All that part of the Parish lying East of Brunswick Street and South of the Regent's Canal. The Boundary of the Parish is the Hackney Road, from Brunswick Street to Kay Street, and continues by an irregular line and crosses over the Goldsmith's Row Bridge. No. 8—Acton Ward.—All that part of the Parish lying on the Hackney side of the Regent's Canal and East of the Kingsland Road. The Northern Boundary is the Parish of Hackney. 7 Under the Reform Act of 1832 the Parish was united with others to form the Borough of the Tower Hamlets; but under the Representation of the People Act, 1867, Shoreditch, together with the adjoining Parishes of Hackney and Bethnal Green, was constituted as the Borough of Hackney, and returned two Members to Parliament, but under the "Seats Act" of 1885, Shoreditch is constituted a Parliamentary Borough with two Members (see above and under). The Vestry Clerk of this Parish, Mr. Enoch Walker, has been appointed by the Sheriff of Middlesex the Returning Officer for the Borough. Under the Education Act of 1870 the Borough in which Shoreditch is included returns five Members to the London School Board. Under the Looal Act (1858), six Overseers are appointed yearly, viz. :— One for the Liberty of Holywell One for the Liberty of Moorfields. Two for the Liberty of Church End. Two for the Liberty of Hoxton. These Liberties are obsolete for all purposes excepting only the above, and for certain Charities. The Rates are made and collected quarterly. The Public Lighting of the Parish is carried out by the Vestry's own staff. The gas consumed is supplied by the Gas Light and Coke Company, the system adopted is that of metering one lamp in twenty, and paying upon the average consumption as indicated by the metered lamps. The Parish is supplied with water by the New River and East London "Water Companies : about two-thirds of the Parish is within the area supplied by the first-named Company. The lines of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company are laid in the main thoroughfares. 8 The North London Railway Company and the Great Eastern Railway Company run through the parish ; and the London and North "Western Railway Company have extensive goods yards therein. Tho Regent's Canal Company intersects the parish from west to east. The population, as shown by the last census, was 126,560 ; the number of premises is 15,979, of which 15,156 are inhabited houses. The number of names in the Rate Book is 18,372. 9 REPORT OF THE VESTRY CLERK. Gentlemen, During the year ending Lady-day, 1885, the amount collected on the Poor's Rate was £63,633 11s. 6d. ; the amount in the pound levied for the four Quarters was 2s. 3d., being for the Quarter to Midsummer, 7d. ; to Michaelmas, 7d. ; to Christmas 6d. ; and to Lady-day, 7d. During the previous year the Poor Rate was 2s. 4d. The amount of the Guardians' calls for the year ending Ladyday, 1884, was £53,400 ; and for the last year, £50,600 ; and for the Half-year, Lady-day to Michaelmas, 1885, is £32,000. The amount owing to the Guardians at Lady-day, 1885, was £5,800. Further particulars of the expenditure of Poor Rates will be found in the Balance Sheets, as audited and signed. SEWERS AND GENERAL RATES. The statement hereto appended will give the details of the Receipts and Expenditure on account of the Sewers and General Rates. It is only neoessary here to state that the Rates levied for the last year were— s. d. General—in the £ 2 2 Sewers ditto 0 6 2 8 The total amount collected on the Vestry Rates for the year was £77,114 2s. 6d., an increase upon the previous year of £2,228 6s. 5d. 10 Of those sums collected by the Vestry as for Poor Rates, large amounts are paid to other authorities for purposos over which the Vestry has no control. Thus, in addition to the £50,600 paid to the Guardians, out of which the County Rate and Metropolitan Asylam's Board's charges are paid, there is a sum of £12,475 15s. 5d. paid to the Commissioners of Metropolitan Police, and £547 14s. for Registration, &c., expenses. From the Hewers Rate is paid the Metropolitan Board's Consolidated Rate of £14,179 3s. 4d. From the General Rate is paid the School Board Rate of £19,525 13s. 2d., and the Toll Bridgos Precept of £1,877 13s. 7d. All these charges are based upon tho rateable value of the property according to the valuation list, and no reduction is made for empty houses, or for the allowance to owners. ASSESSMENT. Tho valuation of tho Parish for Assessment purposos is as follows, as compared with tho corresponding period of the previous year— List in forco— April, 1884. April, 1885. Increase. Gross rental £751,295 £753,628 £2333 Rateable value 607,910 609,834 1924 The number of Assessments and tho Rateable Value of each Ward, omitting such of the Gas, Water, Railway and other Assessments, as aro included in several Wards, are as follows: — Number of Assessments. Rateable Vulue. Moorfields Ward 1,363 80,308 Church Ward, North 1,974 54,192 Church Ward, South . 1,155 57,694 Hoxton Ward 2,350 70,670 Wenlock Ward 1,774 54,017 Whitmore Ward . 2,245 53,297 Kingsland Ward 1,729 42,515 Haggerstone 1,624 33,600 Acton Ward 1,765 39,219 11 The Rateable Value of the Parish is made up as follows:— Railways £59,874 Gas Company 28,344 Water Companies 6,350 Tramway Company 2,500 Regent's Canal Company 738 Board Schools 7,814 Hoxton House Asylum 1,063 Theatres and Taverns attached thereto 2,605 The Town Hall 1,000 Other Assessments of £500 and upwards, including Model Dwellings of that value 36,540 The Workhouse and Infirmary belonging to the Holborn Union in the City Road, is by Local Act rated at £19 only. The Shoreditch Workhouse and Infirmary is not Assessed. The total of the above is £147,357, which shows that the ordinary Assessments, under £500, amount to £460,553. ASSESSMENT OF BOARD SCHOOLS. An Appeal of considerable importance was made to the Assessment Sessions by the London School Board, and in respect to the Board Schools in St. John's road. The point in dispute was not so much the value of the premises as ascertained by the ordinary methods, but the principle upon which Board Schools ought to be assessed. The amount of gross and rateable value has generally been determined upon a reference to the value of the land and the cost of building, and this was decided by the Court of Assessment Sessions some years ago to be the correct method. The School Board now contends, that neither the cost of the Schools nor the rent which the Board would have to pay if they hired the same furnish the correct criterion of value, but that the Schools should be rated at a nominal figure (say £150 instead of £1000), because they are compelled to carry them on at a loss, and consequently no ordinary person or body keeping such schools for profit could afford 12 to pay more than a nominal rent. The Assessment Sessions practically confirmed the Parochial Assessments both in Shoreditch and Islington, but granted cases raising the point for decision by the Court of Appeal. The Arguments will probably be heard in November next. SCHOOL BOARD EXPENDITURE. Communications were received from sovoral Vestries and Boards protesting against the increased expenditure, and consequently inoreasod money demands by the London School Board. The amount required from this Parish for the year 1884 was £19,525 13s. 2d., and for 1885, £21,763 7s. 11d., being an increase of £2,237 14s. 9d. for the year. The Vestry was invited by the Vestry of St. James' to send delegates to a conference, hold at the Mansion House, upon the subject of School Board Expenditure, but the only outcome of the conference seems to have been a rocommondation to the several Vostrios and Boards to urge upon the Ratepayers the selection and support of Candidates pledged to economy. PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS. The passing of the Registration Act and the Redistribution of Seats Act are matters of such general knowledgo as to call for no particular notice in this Report. It is notified elsewhere that the Parish of Shoreditch has now been constituted a Parliamentary Borough, in two Divisions, Hoxton and Haggerston, returning one member each. The following statistics wore submitted to the Boundary Commissioners, and after a local enquiry held by the Assistant Commisioner, Mr. Pemberton Loach, tho boundaries as below were adopted. Hoxton Division. Population as per Census of 1881. Electors on tho Register for 1884 (not including lodgers). Moorfields Ward 9,492 1,339 Church Ward 23,273 2,721 Hoxton Ward 21,120 1,785 Wenlock Ward 15,705 1,485 69,590 7,330 13 Haggerston Division. Whitmore Ward 19,996 1,791 Kingsland Ward 12,850 1,370 Haggerston Ward 11,772 1,269 Acton Ward 12,383 1,356 57,001 5,786 Tramways. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company introduced a Bill to obtain powers to construct a line of Tramway from Goswell Road to Bloomsbury, and from Shoreditch, through Bethnal Green Road to Cambridge Road. The scheme was opposed, partly by the Metropolitan Board, and partly by the Vestry of Bethnal Green, and the result was that the extension from Goswell Road to the Holborn Town Hall was allowed, but the Bethnal Green extension was not proceeded with. I have reason to believe that the Company will at once proceed with the extension to the Holborn Town Hall, and afterwards from Old Street to Shoreditch, via Great Eastern Street, powers for which were granted in the Sessions of 1884. Thames Communications. The most important proposal to provide better communications between the North and South of the Metropolis made to Parliament this year, was by the Corporation of London, upon the recommendation of a previous Committee of the House of Commons. The scheme proposed was to provide a Bridge near the Tower, with such gradients as should be practical, and of such construction as should admit of vessels passing at high tide. This is to be accomplished by an opening in the centre of the Bridge when required by means of hydraulic machinery. The estimate of the cost of the Bridge and its approaches is £750,000, and the source whence the money is to be provided is the Bridge House Estates in the possession of the Corporation. The Vestry gave its cordial support to this scheme, and the Bill has now received the sanction of P ac liam ent. 14 The Metropolitan Board promoted a Bill to authorise the establishment of free ferries at Woolwich and Greenwich, but owing to excessive claims made for compensation in respect to the Greenwich and Poplar ferry, that was abandoned. Water Companies' Charges. An important Act has been passed this Session making the Rateable Value as defined by the Parochial Rate books the basis of Water Companies' charges. This gives a legislative effect to the decision in the case of the Dobbs' Appeal. Electric Lighting Orders. The Provisional Orders obtained by the Metropolitan Brush Electric Light Company in 1883 have been revoked by the Board of Trade, in consequence of the inability of the Company to proceed. London and North-western Railway. This Company sought for powers this Session to make a level crossing in Worship street, to connect the coal yard with the goods yard. The proposal was opposed by the Vestry and the Metropolitan Board, and was abandoned. Electric and Telephone Wires. Several of the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards requested the Government to appoint a Select Committee to consider what regulations and provisions were required for the protection of the public from danger alleged to attend the unauthorised extension of these overhead wires all over the Metropolis. A select Committee was appointed, and heard evidence pro and con upon the question. The report of the Committee was entirely unsatisfactory to the various Local Authorities, and apparently to the Government, inasmuch as no steps seem to be contemplated to give effect to the Committee's recommendations. Islington to City Subway. A Bill to authorise the construction of a tunnel under the City road, from Islington to Moorgate street, was introduced to Parlialiament. A portion of the works would have been in Shoreditch Parish. The Parliamentary Committee did not think it necessary to oppose a soheme which from the first appeared to possess no vitality. The Bill collapsed after 1st reading. 15 Columbia Market & North London Railway. Two Bills having a combined object were introduced. The Columbia Market project was to form a branch line from the North London Railway into the Market, crossing over Hackney road, and with proper lifts, &c., to provide means for taking trucks laden with provisions directly from practically all the railways in the Metropolis to the Market, and also of removing market produce therefrom. The North London Bill was to provide the necessary sidings, &c., to enable the Columbia Market branch to be worked. The Vestry required and obtained the necessary protective clauses, and the Bills passed. Regents Canal and Railway Bill. The object of this Bill was to remove a restriction as to the conditions under which capital was to be raised, and to authorise the work to be carried out in sections. The Vestry gave a modified support, and the Bill passed. It would be premature to offer any opinion as to how far the powers obtained by this Act will facilitate the progress of the undertaking. Sanitary, &c. An important Bill is now before Parliament—the Criminal Law Amendment Bill* which will enable the Police Authorities to deal with the keepers of, and also persons letting or continuing to let houses for immoral purposes, under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. This, it is hoped, will much simplify the process of prosecution, and remove from the Parochial Officials a duty which they are by no means fitted to discharge. An important measure bearing upon sanitary matters and the duties of Sanitary Authorities is also before Parliament—the " Housing of the Working Classes Bill" *. It makes important amendments to several important Acts, and will be the subject of a more complete digest than can be given in this Report. * Since passed. 16 THE NEW PARLIAMENTARY BOROUGH. Perhaps the most important Parliamentary enactment affecting the Parish of Shoreditch, in common with the entire Metropolis, is the " Re-distribntion of Seats Act," by which this Parish has been constituted a Parliamentary Borough, with two Divisions, each returning one Member. The Boundary Commission appointed by the Government directed a local enquiry as to the most convenient scheme for dividing the Borough. Ultimately a scheme favored by the Vestry was adopted, by whioh the first four Wards arranged for Vestry Elections, viz. Moorfields, Church, Hoxton and Wenlock, are constituted the First or Hoxton Division, and the second four Wards, viz.: Whitmore, Kingsland, Haggerston and Acton, are constituted the Second or Haggerston Division. A new qualification for Voters has been provided by the " Representation of the People Aot, 1884 "—the Service Franchise. It is expected that this addition to the qualifications, and the concentrated interest which will be thrown into Parliamentary Elections by the reduoed areas consequent upon the division of Boroughs and increase of representatives, will cause a large addition to the number of Registered Parliamentary Voters, and consequently increased expense both for Registrations and Elections. LEGAL, &c. Several disorderly houses have been removed during the year by notices. In one case warrants were obtained, but before these could be executed the parties fled. Several houses are under observation. The Vestry has not during this year been engaged in any litigation, except in minor matters at the Police Court, one of which is to be submitted to a superior Court, and a small defence at the County Court, and there are no matters of dispute of any consequence pending. NEW SEWER IN DALSTON AND HAGGERSTON. The Metropolitan Board, upon the repeated request of the Vestry, has consented to construct a new sewer through the Queen's 17 road and Great Cambridge street and part of Hackney road, with an outfall into the middle sewer in Bethnal Green road. This is a provision which has long been needed, but before the advantages of it can be afforded to the neighbourhood intended to be benefitted, it will be necessary for the Yestry to re-construct several local sewers, and probably to raise a considerable loan for the purpose. There is reason also to believe that the Metropolitan Board will shortly find it necessary to re-construct the entire length of sewer from Great Cambridge street to Shoreditch. THE METROPOLITAN BOARD. An Aot has passed for increasing by thirteen the number of Members of this Board, but Shoreditch is not affected. THE TOWN HALL. During the year the Large Hall has been let 169 times; the Council Chamber 7 times; the Committee Rooms have been used by Local Societies, mostly free of charges. The receipts for letting Hall, Counoil Chamber, and Committee Rooms were £1,117. VESTRY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS. The number of Yestry and Committee Meetings held during the year ended April 30th, 1885, is as follows— Number of Vestry Meetings 34 Finance Committee (including Meetings of Audit Committee) 32 Sewers, &c., Committee 24 General Purposes Committee 34 Valuation Committee, including Sub-Committee 14 Town Hall Committee do 20 Parliamentary and Improvement Committee 9 Total 167 18 Appended are various Tables showing Receipts and Expenditure, Assets and Liabilities, Loans Outstanding, Analyst's Reports, List of Contracts, &c., &c.

Gentlemen, I beg to submit a summary of works, &c., carried out under the superintendence of the above Department during the year ending the 25th March, 1885. MAINTENANCE OF ROADS. The following quantities of material were supplied by the Guardians and Contractors at the cost stated, and used on the MacAdam and ballast roads in the Parish during the year— 1553¼ yards cube Broken Granite 1279 17 2 1976¼ „ „ Flints 724 12 6 28½ „ ,, Ballast 8 11 0 1288¼ „ „ Hoggin 386 9 6 During the same period 725 cubic yards of old pebbles, York, &c., were broken up, costing £75 1s. 6d., and loaded and carted for repairing the roads at a further cost of about £90 12s. 6d. One foreman and four labourers on average were employed in the yard, and on the general repairs of the unpaved roads and over trenches opened by the Gas and Water Companies; their wages for the year amounted to £291 10s. l½d. The sum of 6s. was also paid for Watchmen's wages. The Companies contributed £73 17s. for labour (exclusive of Foremen's time) and £152 19s. 3d. for material required in the said repairs. 48 In consequence of the use of the Steam Roller the unpaved roads are, generally speaking, in a satisfactory condition. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The Roller was at work 267 days during the past year, and about 14 men on average, under the superintendence of a foreman, were employed in scoring, rolling, sweeping and watching the highways; the amount expended in labour was £900 18s. 7½d. 49 The following Table gives the roads that have been rolled, together with the cost of same, and other details;— LOCALITY.

Gentlemen, 4,936 births—2,484 males and 2,452 females; and 2,871 deaths were registered in the twelve months ending 25th March, 1885. Deducting the deaths (292) which occurred in Holborn Infirmary, the mortality was 20.80 per 1,000 living, being slightly below the average of the last five years, which was 21.57 per 1,000. The largest number of deaths was registered in Haggerstone Distriot, in which is situate Shoreditch Infirmary. The following statistics show the rate of mortality in the different Registration Districts of the parish:— Population. Deaths. Average per 1000 living. Holywell 7,376 111 15.04 Saint Leonard 14,967 288 19.20 Hoxton New Town 29,937 783 16.40 Hoxton Old Town 28,036 497 14.10 Haggerston 46,275 1,192 25.50 662 deaths occurred in the public institutions of the parish, viz:— 296 in Shoreditch Infirmary, 292 in Holborn Infirmary (situate in Hoxton New Town), 43 in the North Eastern Hospital, and 31 in Hoxton House. 80 Diseases acknowledged to be induced by cold and damp were very destructive. There were 393 deaths from bronchitis, 282 from phthisis, and 196 from pneumonia, making a total of 873 deaths registered under the above headings. 1,452 deaths occurred under one year of age—against 1,413 in the previous year. The deaths under five years of age have decreased—2,323 against 2,399 in the previous year. 684 deaths occurred of persons 65 years of age and upwards, viz:— 475 from 65 to 75; 169 from 75 to 85, and 40 from 85 to 95. In the previous year 537 persons died between 65 and 75 years of age; 249 from 75 to 85; 42 from 85 to 95, and two over 95 years of age. In childhood (from 1 to 5 years of age) the largest number of deaths was caused by lung disease (363), comprising 122 from bronchitis, 119 from pneumonia, and 122 from congestion of lungs, &o. The diseases which came next in order of fatality were atrophy and debility, (116 deaths); convulsions 87; whooping cough 108; promature birth 76, and Diarrhœa 109. From the age of 55 and upwards 192 deaths were caused by bronchitis; 66 by heart disease; and 73 by Paralysis; 216 were registered under the term of "old age." ZYMOTIC DISEASES caused 378 deaths, viz:—13 by small pox; 52 by scarlet fever; 26 by enteric fever; 4 by typhus; 14 by diptheria; 30 by measles; 108 by whooping cough, and 130 by diarrhœa, and 44 by other zymotic diseases. 58 of the 109 deaths from whooping cough occurred in infants under one year of age. The influence of age is manifest,—98 of the 109 deaths from whooping cough were in infants under two years of ago, and 108 of the 130 deaths from diarrhœa occurred in infants under two years of age DISINFECTION.—To arrest the spread of contagious diseases 806 houses wore disinfected, the infected rooms fumigated by sulphur, and subsequently the windows kept open to expose the room freely to the oxydising influences of the open air. The walls of the rooms, where necessary, were stripped and otherwise cleansed. 81 509 cases of small pox were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 468 were for isolation removed to hospital; 41 could not be removed, of these 13 died. There are no data to show how many cases had occurred in private houses which were not reported. Means for isolating the infected persons have been at all times in the year available in the hospitals of the Asylums Board, and but little difficulties have been experienced in otherwise obtaining the removal of the infected. But in some dwellings containing several families where infectious disorders occurred, whilst the sick were isolated by removal to the hospital, the dwellings could not be efficiently disinfected and cleansed, for the infected rooms could not be emptied, or there was no place into which the remaining members of the infected family could be removed. Such a place should be provided, especially to prevent infectious disease extending in crowded poor districts. DWELLINGS IMPROVED.—It is now recognized that disease, acute and chronic, is the result of slow, insidious deterioration in the functions and structures of the body; determined by injurious conditions slowly accumulating. The injurious conditions are usually not felt until the disease is extensively produced. Hence the Sanitary Authority, year by year, endeavours to remove unhealthy conditions, knowing, that if they are allowed to remain, they must of necessity destroy health, and to a greater extent than persons will for awhile perceive. In the past year, to secure that protection, 1,856 premises have been inspected. In 1,621 of these dwellings, conditions dangerous to health were found, and the owners were called on to make the requisite alterations. In and around dwellings it is indispensable for health to promote as much freshness as possible, therefore it is absolutely necessary to remove rubbish and decomposing refuse as much as possible from the dwellings. The freshness comes by the healthful circulation of air and other elementary powers in and around the dwellings; but it cannot circulate and sweeten the walls if they are dangerously damp, for such accumulation of water hinders that 82 ciruulation, and causes the materials of the house to decompose and poison; nor can it circulate through and cleanse the ground on which the house stands, if it be very damp. Therefore, as Inspoctor Alexander's report shews, great attention has boon bestowed in bringing about improvements to remove dampness and in that and other ways secure the required circulation to remove or destroy the poisonous accumulations. Thus the walls of 608 dwellings have boon cleansed and repaired, and to secure dryness and ventilation in the ground, the yards of 522 dwellings have been paved with impervious material. To remove poisonous refuse, the drains of 500 premises have been repaired, re-laid or otherwise altered; and to prevent the dwellings being impregnated with sower gas 435 stack pipes, situated near to windows of dwellings, were disconnected from the drains; 301 waste pipes of sinks were disconnected from the drains, and 732 closets supplied with water. And the report refers to a large number of other detailed improvements all tending to carry away decomposing noxious matters, and promote more freshness and renewing conditions. There are a large number of dwellings in Shoreditch that must be thus every year inspected and improved, but it is noticeable that the cleansing, repairs, paving, and other works have boon better, that is more durably done, consequently some of the old dangerous habitations have boon loss frequently of late under the notice of the Sanitary Authority. And there is an increasing disposition on the part of the owners to co-operate with the Sanitary Authority in removing conditions dangerous to health. The real interest of owners of property and of the Sanitary Authority are identical. Both require the dwellings to bo constructed in a useful and enduring manner, so that there may be the greatest return for the outlay, and the greatest protection and help to the inhabitants. Both interests require sound material and reliable skilled workmanship, and the owners already perceive that the Sanitary Officer seeks to secure both; and that it is not the purpose of the Sanitary Authority to exercise a harassing inefficient overlooking, but to aid economy by securing work hotter done, and more serviceable materials used, and adapted for the needs of the inhabitants, 83 The needs of the tenants must be regarded, for they depend on their health for their work, and they pay their rent for equitable return in means for rest and shelter, and other protecting influences; and those owners are the greatest enemy to the interests of property who fail to give equitable return, for they teach their tenants to be equally unfair and become utterly careless of the dwellings. And however much may be recognized and said of the neglect of the tenants, yet improvement in that respect can only come by owners having the means, applying them properly, so that each party to the contract may receive a fair return, and therewith be encouraged to be more considerate, and more careful of his own and others. Guided by such considerations your Vestry have shown to owners much consideration but much firmness in bringing about alterations in dwellings to make them more serviceable to the inhabitants of the Parish. Some years ago the Sanitary Authority summoned many owners before the Magistrate, and legal orders were obtained directing the owners to carry out the requirements of the.Vestry; but it was seen that the owners could ostensibly obey the Magistrate's order without doing the work well, and the Sanitary Authority was brought to avoid as much as possible resorting to such proceedings, but instead, to show much fair consideration to the owners of dwellings, and when that failed, the Vestry, for the protection of the health of the inhabitants, directed workmen to enter on the premises and make such alterations and improvements as were urgently and indispensibly called for, and charge the owners with the cost. In this manner the owners were not harassed by being summoned to the Law Courts, and the Vestry showed that if the owners could not be influenced by reasonable consideration, then the Sanitary Authority must exercise the powers conferred upon them by the Acts of Parliament, and do what was requisite for public health. These remarks your Medical Officer is required to make, as shewing how a practice has grown up in the course of years of experience, and I am led to refer to it now, in connection with the Inspector's report of dangerous nuisances which occurred at Norwich road and Regent's row, for in that instance the Sanitary Authority showed a necessary consideration to the owner, for when the 84 promises became dangerous to health, a few years before the last proceedings, the owner, by order of the Vestry, to a groat extent abated the nuisance,but he did not have the work done thoroughly and to the satis faction of the Sanitary Officer; but as the nuisance was at that time seemingly removed, the Medical Officer agreed to allow the value of the improvements to bo tested by time, thereby mooting the owner on his own grounds. This course was advisably falcon to enable the Sanitary Committee, should events necessitate it, to report to the Vestry that the owners wishes and measures had been acceded to, and they had entirely failed, and therefore the Vestry, on the recurrence of the dangerous nuisance, must require the owner to speedily and thoroughly abate the nuisance, or the Vestry would bo obliged to direct workmen to enter on the premises and to do what was required in the interest of public health. The promises became charged with sewage and the drains wore useless; and after many days of dilatory proceeding the Sanitary Committee directed workmen to enter and do what was required. And I submit that the Sanitary Authority had no alternative ; in the face of the facts they must either do that with as little delay as possible, or increasingly endanger the lives of the inhabitants, and the Sanitary Authority having taken that course wore bound to have the work well done, and with such alterations as wore necessary to make the houses safe to live in. I have ventured to recall those particulars to your Vestry, with a view of showing that the course most conducive to the welfare of the health of the Parish, is to endeavour to induce the owners themselves to put and keep their dwellings suitable for the health of the tenants, but should they after much consideration fail to do that, it is waste of time and means to merely contend in words, the Sanitary Authority is then called upon to order the premises to bo entered and the requisite changes made. Such firmness will in this, and other great questions, more quickly lead to a mutual understanding. I am further led to make these remarks, for the question is increasingly forced on the public mind, what manner of proceedings shall be adopted to secure healthier dwellings. LODGING HOUSE REGULATIONS.—During the recent demonstrations respecting the deplorable condition of the dwellings 85 of the poor, it was urged as a remedy, that the "Lodging House Regulations," based on the Sanitary Act of 1866, should be more stringently carried out, and Shoreditch was alluded to as one of the Parishes that had neglected to put the regulations in force. As a matter of fact, I may call to the mind of your Yestry, that soon after the Act was passed an earnest effort was made to carry out the Regulations in the dwellings in Ware Street, &c., and legal proceedings were resorted to, to enforce the regulations, and failed ; it was then, and afterwards found more useful to resort to the Nuisance Removal Acts. The owners and the tenants opposed the working of the Regulations, and it was evident that an officer would be required to give most of his time to see that the Regulations were carried out; even if he did so, the Regulations could only be applied to a comparatively small number of houses let in lodgings. It was further clearly seen that if houses were registered and the Regulations not stringently carried into operation the proceedings would be mischevious. In considering the applicabilities of the Regulations it is requisite to bear in mind, that there is no parallel between the houses in which persons, however poor, are endeavouring to keep a house over their heads, and the police lodging houses. Nevertheless in accordance with the instructions of your Vestry, I have endeavoured to bring into operation the new Regulations. My attention was called to some large houses, each let out to several families, and I found them in an exceedingly dirty, and otherwise injurious condition; and the Inspector reported that he had repeatedly served Sanitary Notices on the owners, and alterations were made, but the owners soon allowed the dwellings to become again unfit for habitation. It seemed to your Medical Officer that the Regulations would be very applicable to such dwellings and owners, but in referring to the Regulations I found that houses of a rental of more than sixty pounds a year, or the apartments let for more than six shillings per week could not be placed under the Regulations. The apartments were let for more than six shillings per week and the Regulations could not be applied. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HENRY G. SUTTON, Medical Officer of Health. 87 INSPECTOR ALEXANDER'S REPORT. ST. LEONARD, SHOREDITCH, Sanitary Department. To the Medical Officer of Health, Sir, I beg to present the following report on the Sanitary work done under my superintendence during the year ending 25th March, 1885, shewing the number of premises inspected, the nature of nuisances under notice, and the orders made for their abatement. House to house visitation, and special inspection with reference to complaints made in 1856 premises. Notices served requiring the abatement of nuisances injurious to health in 1621 premises.

MISCELLANEOUS-. Over-crowding abated in 18 premises. Water restored in 65 „ Urinals on private premises trapped and purified in 3 ,, Animals, kept so as to be a nuisance, removed from 9 „ Accumulation of dung and rubbish removed from 26 „ Making a total of 5,430 separate nuisances, dangerous to health, abated in 1,621 dwellings. In addition to the ordinary notices served for the abatement of nuisances, 693 letters have been written, and a special report presented by order of Committee on the sanitary condition of the Town Hall. To show the character of the work done, a few cases are given in detail as follows : WEYMOUTH MEWS.— This place was unpaved and defectively drained. The nuisance arising from these conditions was much aggravated by the want of a public urinal. This occasioned considerable difficulty. The only possible position for a urinal being on land belonging to St. Thomas's Hospital which is leased to the tenant of 191, Hackney Road. This being represented to the Vestry, I was authorized to communicate with the Hospital Authorities, and the leaseholder, with a view to the erection by the Vestry of a public urinal on the land in question. After much negotiation all opposition was withdrawn, an agreement to pay 2/6 a year signed, and a urinal erected. The roadway of the Mews has also (under the Vestry's order) been paved with granite cubes and properly drained by the leaseholders of the property abutting thereon. These works have abated a long standing nuisance. 90 7 & 8, NORWICH ROAD, and 62 & 63, REGENT'S ROW.— Complaint having been received that the basement of the house No. 8, Norwich Road, was flooded with sewage, an inspection was made, and it was found that sewage had accumulated to a height of 12-in. on the floor of the scullery, or wash-house. Notices to rectify the drains, yards, water closets, and provide dustbins, &c., were served, and work was commenced, but carried on in a very dilatory way, the work done moreover was of the most unsatisfactory character. The Committee having visited the premises and inspected the defective work of drainlaying—ordered the premises to be entered under the powers given by the Metropolis Local Management Acts. This was done and the works executed by the Vestry's Contractor in the most satisfactory manner. I may mention that the measure of the dangerous conditions existing in these houses was not fully ascertained until the builder commenced operations, when it was discovered that the combinations of house drains, and the main drain into which they discharge, were all of the most defective and dangerous character. Many of the pipes were only broken fragments choked with sewage and soddening the ground in which they were laid. Where junction pipes should have been provided for connecting branch drains, there were instead only roughly broken holes in the receiving pipes on which the branch pipes were laid, some of the sewage thus passed into the receiving pipes, but much of it went into the ground. It was also discovered at No. 8, Norwich Road, that the closet was not trapped, that the pan was fixed merely in the eye of a junction pipe. As this closet and some of the closets of the other houses are built within the walls of the sculleries, and as the doors opened into the sculleries it was obvious, in the absence of proper traps, that sewer gas could flow uninterruptedly into the houses. The closets were moroover very defectively lighted, defectively supplied with water, and consequently filthy. Acting in accordance with the Committee's instruction I directed the doorway of the closet in the scullery of No. 8, Norwich Road, to be bricked up and a 91 doorway to be made in the outer wall, thus securing light and ventilation into the open air. The necessity for this alteration was demonstrated very quickly. The following day it was discovered that a man was lying dead in the back parlor of 63, Regent's Row, who had died of typhus fever, and on examination it was proved that the closet was fitted like that of 8, Norwich Road. There was no trap, there was indeed nothing whatever to protect the tenants from being poisoned with sewer gas. The Committee, therefore, directed the same alteration of closets in No. 63, and also No. 62, Regent's Row, as they had previously directed at No. 8, Norwich Road. In executing the foregoing works, and to secure proper drainage of yards, sink and sculleries, it has been necessary (the back part of the yards being above the level of the part adjacent to the houses), to extend the lower part 3-ft. 6-in. by removal of that much of the upper part, and to repave the yards and sculleries, the same being in a very defective state. The dust bins provided by the owner were constructed of fragments of old decayed wood and could not be durable. In their place, as directed by the Committee, substantial brick bins have been substituted. In conclusion, I beg to say that it has been necessary for me to devote an altogether disproportionate amount of my time to these houses. 23 to 49, REEVE'S PLACE. These seventeen cottages are old and somewhat decayed structures, having large forecourts in Reeve's Place and small back yards abutting on Nuttall Street. The back yards were defectively paved, and the water closets foul and dilapidated, the forecourts originally intended for gardens, but now used largely for trade purposes by costermongers, were not paved nor drained, and could not be kept clean; they were therefore, generally in a miry condition, to which the interiors of the houses responded; and it could not be otherwise. 92 These cottages are now clean and dry back and front. Under notices the various owners have well paved and drained the back yards and fitted them with gulley sinks, cleansed and repaired the water closets—fitted them with water, with concrete floors, and with open spaces under seats to prevent the accumulation there of foul matters. Acting on my recommendation the owners have also paved the seventeen forecourts all over with cement concrete, raised above the level of the public footpath to secure efficient surface drainage; and public dust bins of my improved design have been constructed in the forecourts. These substantial results were not obtained without an educational process in sanitation. In past years the owners were called upon to put their houses in order, and they responded to the letter of the sanitary requirements, but, unacquainted with building works, and misapprehending the spirit of sanitation, their money was spent without advantage to themselves or any one else, save the incompetent men they employed. Some years observation of these facts enabled me to show to the owners the errors of their economy and to stimulate them to secure better results for their own property by personal inspection of good work done in other premises. ABSTRACT FROM REGISTER OF ASSISTANT INSPECTOR'S WORK. 806 cases of contagious diseases were reported to the Sanitary Department, of which 509 were cases of small-pox. 468 of the small-pox cases were removed to hospital, and 13 died at home. Much care was taken to prevent the spread of this disease, by isolating the sick and disinfecting the houses. Number of beds disinfected at the Vestry's disinfecting oven during the above period 703 Ditto pillows ditto 1,153 Ditto palliasses ditto 445 Ditto bolsters ditto 444 Ditto other articles ditto 2,339 Making a total of 4,984 articles disinfected. 93 Number of articles destroyed and replaced by the Yestry:— 163 beds 154 palliasses 78 bolsters 237 pillows 8 sofa bed squabs ARTICLES OF FOOD, &c., condemned and destroyed as being unfit for human consumption :— 2 trunks of wet haddocks 1 third of a box of Spanish onions 4 cwt. of pork cuttings 1½ cwt. of various piece3, beef, veal, mutton, &c. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. No. of articles analysed:—(See Analyst's Report). Samples of Butter 24 Ditto Milk 30 Ditto Bread 2 REMOVAL OF DUST.—during the past year the number of dust complaints has been in excess of the average number of the three preceeding years, as shown below :— Eastern Division. Western Division. 1st 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd 3rd 1884-5 1,538 16 0 2,081 15 0 In the previous three years the average number was— 1,287 23 0 1,387 13 0 Scavenging of roads has been fairly attended to by the Vestry's Contractor. WATERING THE ROADS.—This work was done fairly well, but as in the previous year much loss of time was occasioned by the defective condition of the Vans supplied by the Contractor, this will be obviated in the future, the Vestry having purchased 15 new Vans.
