Ditto, Offensive Trades. Water Supply. Referring to my remarks in last year's Report concerning the deposit present in the water, 1 am pleased to report that no complaints have been received during the year. The improvement is very marked, I have personally not noticed any deposit. Drainage and Sewerage. The scheme for the abolition of the Eastcote pumping station and the laying of a new outfall sewer from this station through King's College Estate to the existing outfall works at Ruislip is complete. New pumps and engines have been installed, which together with the new pump well and tanks, deal with the increased population from the recent development of the East ote and Ruis.ip area. A certain section of the new outfall at South Ruislip (draining by agreement into the new Uxbridge outfall works) is completed. This will enable the Northolt Junction Estate to be drained and connected to the new outfall sewer, and these works are now being carried out. 13 Scavenging. Collection of House Refuse. A weekly collection of House Refuse was carried out during the year by Fordson tractors and trailers. The refuse from the whole of the District is conveyed to the destructor site at Eastcote, where it is sorted, screened, the inflammable part (paper, etc.), is burnt in the open. This tip is some distance from any inhabited houses, and no nuisance has been caused by this method of disposal. The tip at Northolt Road, Eastcote, is almost full up, and the Public Health Committee have bee.i considering the whole question of disposal of house refuse, and the Surveyor made a report to the Committee in December. He reported upon the methods of:— (i) Incineration and Salvage; (ii) Controlled Tipping. This report is still under consideration. 1 here are several sites in this district where controlled tipping could be carried on quite successfully, and if properly supervised, should cause no nuisance. Portable sanitary dustbins are provided and maintained by the house owners. The removal and disposal of house refuse has been very satisfactory. No nuisance has been caused, and only 16 complaints of a trivial nature were received during the year. Schools. All the Schools in the Urban District are under the management of the Middlesex County Council. Housing. The Council have provided the following houses:— Northwood. Pinner Road Site, 1919-1920 114 during 1925 12 during 1926 28 Total for Northwood 154 14 Eastcote.

This Estate is situate between West End Road and the Great Western and L. & N.E. Joint Railway Line, close to Northolt Junction Station. There are the following buildings on the Estate:— Permanent buildings erected under the Bye-laws 72 Buildings erected under the Housing Acts (licensed for a long period) 7 Temporarily occupied buildings 56 Temporary Buildings (Tool Sheds, Summer Houses, etc.) 105 Total 240 15 The laying of sewers in the roads was commenced during the year, and will be completed in 1930. These works will make a very great improvement, the class of property will, I think, now improve, and permanent buildings be erected. Two closing orders were made on temporary hutments which had fallen into a bad state of repair. Milk Supply. The Milk and Dairies Order, 1926. There are the following persons on the Registers:— Retail Purveyors 19 Wholesale Traders and Producers 19 Dairies 8 Cowsheds 18 Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923. The following licences were granted for the sale of:— Certified Milk 5 Grade "A" T.T. Milk 5 Grade “A” 1 Pasteurised Milk 4 In addition to the above licences one farm in the district is producing and selling certified milk under licence by the Ministry of Health. The average number of cows in milk during the year was 280. Mr. Sidney Villar, F.R.C.V.S., was appointed Veterinary Inspector for the whole County of Middlesex, as the inspect tion of cows is now taken over by the County Council. Mr. Barr, M.R.C.V.S., who has acted as Veterinary Inspector for this District for the past ten years, resigned his appointment. I very much regret that we have lost the services of Mr. Barr; he carried his work out in a most efficient manner, the cows and cowsheds improved under his supervision to a great extent. 16 The cows and sheds have been inspected very frequently (144 inspections in the year), and I think I can say that the cows and sheds compare very favourably with those in other districts which I have visited.
