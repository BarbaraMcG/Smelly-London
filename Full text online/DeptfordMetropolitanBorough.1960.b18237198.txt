July, 1961. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in presenting this report on the health of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford for 1960. Once again the Birth Rate has risen and the Death Rate has fallen but the Infantile Mortality Rate shows a considerable increase over last year's figure of 18-79 to 29-21 deaths per thousand live births. 38 deaths of infants under one year were recorded and of that figure, 24 died before the end of one week of life. The main medical causes of death in early infancy are premature birth, congenital defects and infection. At the moment infection is the only one that responds readily to preventive action but prematurity can be reduced to a minimum by adequate antenatal care providing that such care is commenced in the early months of pregnancy. The precise causes of congenital defects ocurring in the developing and unborn child are wrapped in the mysteries of heredity and the germ plasm. It is, of course, known that certain viral diseases contracted by the mother in early pregnancy or exposure of the parents to the noxious influences of excessive X-rays or radio-active materials, either from fall-out or from radio-active isotopes used for medical or commercial purposes, can damage the genetic pattern of the developing embryo. It may be that back-ground radiation from the outer cosmos to which all living matter presumably has been exposed from the primordial state acts on susceptible genetic matter and predisposes to the development of mutant genes. Whatever the cause or causes of these distressing happenings, there is no immediate and obvious application practicable to preventive medicine. The total notifications of infectious diseases at 388 reached a new low figure in the Borough's history. This has been, generally, a good year for Deptford. There have been no major epidemics although dysentery has continued to be occasionally troublesome. There was a very gratifying reduction in the notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis and deaths from this disease were reduced to seven for the whole year. This speaks highly for the preventive service organisation from the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, and I am again indebted to Dr. Rigby for another authoritative contribution to my report. The services to old people were greatly expanded by the appointment of another lady visitor. This has allowed more people to be visited and each old person to be given more personal supervision. It has also been possible to extend considerably the laundry service and a home bathing service has been instituted. The Department has been greatly assisted in this work by the many voluntary agencies in the Borough and by the Old People's Welfare Association, as well as by the help which we receive from the general practitioners, the local hospitals and the London County Council Health and Welfare Departments. Operations under the Clean Air Act continue and the No. 1 Smoke Control Area is now in operation and the No. 2 Area Order will be effective from the Ist October, 1961. In the meantime, other areas are being surveyed and the Council hope to be declaring Smoke Control Areas regularly over the next few years until the whole Borough is covered. Of course, success in this scheme is dependent on the co-operation of industry and on the ready availability of smokeless fuel at prices the ordinary citizen can afford. I think it is generally agreed that the conception of a clean atmosphere to match clean and safe water and food is sound, and improvement in the cleanliness of the atmosphere is already apparent. Analysis of our measurement records shows considerable reduction in smoke concentration but little, if any, reduction in sulphur dioxide levels. More research is needed urgently on the problems of diesel and internal combustion engines. The evidence is equivocal and it is difficult in the state of our present knowledge to convict or exonerate the pollutant gases which are being emitted by vehicles in ever greater volumes. Undoubtedly, these gases are irritant and contain known cancer-inducing substances, but are these gases present in sufficient concentration and for sufficient time to have deleterious effects on the populace ? The year saw the retirement of Mr. A. C. Webster, the Chief Public Health Inspector, who had been in the Department as an Inspector for nearly 35 years. Mr. Webster was knowledgeable, keen and conscientious, and I must record the high opinion I formed of his abilities. I found him a loyal and helpful colleague, and his retirement was a loss to the Department and to the citizens of the Borough. I am glad to record the ready co-operation which we receive from the Divisional Health Office under Dr. F. R. Waldron. I must also make mention of the Public Health laboratories at County Hall and Hither Green Hospital who are ever vigilant in the detection of bacteriological contamination. No epidemiological control is effective without the support of a reliable laboratory service and we place great reliance on their technical judgement and clinical acumen. In conclusion, I wish to thank the staff for another year of service and to express my appreciation of the help and support which I receive at all times from the Chariman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical Officer of Health. STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, B.SC., M.B.,ch.B., D.P.H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0-97 and for deaths 1-02 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 330, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 531. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table. I The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948. Area of Borough 1,564 acres. Estimated mid-year home population 69,330 Live Births—Legitimate 1,166 Illegitimate 135 1,301 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 living population 18-78 Still Births—Legitimate 20 Illegitimate 8 28 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 (live and still births.) 21-1 Total Live and Still Births 1,329 Infant Deaths —Legitimate 32 Illegitimate 6 38 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — total 29-21 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — legitimate 27-44 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births — illegitimate 44-44 Neo-natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births (first four weeks) 21-52 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 10-38% Maternal Deaths (including abortion) ... 1 Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and still births 0-75 Total Deaths 770 Death Rate (per 1,000 living) 11-11 Section " B " INFECTIOUS DISEASES INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed a decrease of 798. This decrease is largely due to the biennial fall in Measles notifications viz. 805 in 1959, 94 in 1960. Dysentery also was not so troublesome as in the previous year (114 in 1959). There was no significant alteration in the other infectious diseases notified as compared with the previous year. Although no cases of Poliomyelitis were notified in this borough, two copies of notifications to the Medical Officer of Health for Lewisham were sent to me in relation to patients in the Hither Green Hospital whose home addresses were in Deptford. Similarly, five copies of hospital notifications in respect of cases of puerperal pyrexia were also received although only one case was notified directly to me. No cases of anthrax, cerebro-spinal meningitis, diphtheria, meningococcal infection, smallpox, typhoid fever, and zymotic enteritis were notified during the year. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Public Health Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. There was a decrease of 12 in the number of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified for the first time (7 male and 5 female) and the number of deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1960 was again low, i.e., 6 males and 1 female.

P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, which is of great interest:— Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.60:— Definite 1,066 Observation 37 Number of new contacts examined 334 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 6,204 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary 689 Cases assisted by Care Committee 28 Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1960 £54 0s. 0d. "1960 has been another year of intense activity at the Chest Clinic. A wide variety of chest diseases besides tuberculosis are, of course, dealt with. Special reference must be made to cancer of the lung in this respect. As far as tuberculosis is concerned, despite the removal of 185 cases from the Respiratory Tuberculosis Register, the total numbers remain high and unchanged owing to the addition of newly diagnosed cases and inward transfers. Fifty-seven cases were regarded as recovered from tuberculosis and 100 tuberculous families moved out of Deptford. To take their place, many tuberculous persons moved into Deptford and 79 new cases of tuberculosis were discovered, 37 of which were sputum positive cases on diagnosis. It is interesting to note that the 79 new cases exceeds Rochester, with a population of 199,486, by 2 cases, Woolwich (population 145,470) by 8 cases, and equals Dartford, (population 203,790). Similar figures can be adduced to show that Deptford remains a relatively heavily infected area with pulmonary tuberculosis, accentuated by the presence of Carrington House in the Borough, with fairly large 10 numbers of tuberculous persons moving in and out of the area at frequent intervals." Note:— Dr. Rigby refers to the population covered by the Chest Clinics and not necessarily the population of the Boroughs concerned. Mass Miniature Radiography. I append below a report I have received from the Director of the Mass Radiography Unit: " No major survey was held in the Borough of Deptford during 1960, but an interesting innovation came into full operation last year. It had been felt for a long time that there was a need for a number ot places in South East London and North Kent where a mass X-ray unit paid regular weekly visits so that X-ray facilities were always available for General Practitioners in the area and for others needing urgent X-rays. One of the first places to be chosen for such a visit was at New Cross General Hospital and a unit has been operating there successfully every Friday. In 1960, 3,337 men and 1,572 women, making a total of 4,909 people, were X-rayed in the Borough, the greatest number being people X-rayed at New Cross General Hospital, namely 1,800 men and 1,105 women, making a total of 2,905 people. Out of the total of 4,909 people, 16 new cases of tuberculosis were found and of them 9 required close supervision or treatment. Most of these cases were discovered at New Cross General Hospital. The unit continued to visit certain training colleges and factories in the Borough and to carry out its usual precautionary work of X-raying people at special risk. Among this number were 1,701 men over 45 years of age, who have joined the Special Service aimed at the early detection of lung cancer. It is undoubtedly true that in the Borough there are many thousands who have never yet been X-rayed, but it is hoped that means will be found to bring these people to the units and to discover the many cases of unknown tuberculosis which must exist in the community." 11 Analysis of Results of Survey carried out at Deptford during the Year 1960 (including general public, factories and colleges) General Analysis Men Women Total Part I I (a) Total X-rayed 3,337 1,572 4,909 (b) Total previously mass X-rayed within five years 1,044 2,682 3,726 (c) Total reviewed (considered possibly abnormal at first reading 67 182 249 (d) Considered abnormal after review 49 125 174 (e) Failed to attended for large film - 1 1 Part II (1) Cases considered tuberculous and referred for further investigation: (a) No further action required - - 3 - 7 (b) Occasional supervision 4 (c) Requiring close supervision or treatment 8 1 9 (d) Still under investigation - - - (e) Refused further investigation - - - (2) Previously known tubercular cases 11 6 17 (3) Non-tuberculous cases: 14 32 (a) Investigated 46 (b) Still under investigation - - - 4 (4) Cardio vascular lesions 3 1 (5) Abnormalities requiring no action 67 24 91 Section "C" SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES ETC., AND FACTORIES ACT 14 SANITARY INSPECTION General The total number of primary inspections carried out by the district public health inspectors fell from 6,941 in 1959 to 4,941. The fall in the number of primary inspections was caused by several factors. In the first place, the Chief Public Health Inspector (Mr. Webster) was engaged, for the most part, in duties connected with the inception of the first smoke control area until his retirement from the service in September. Secondly, Mr. Waring, a district Inspector, was detached from those duties and appointed Clean Air Officer with certain duties relating to factories, but mainly engaged with the preparation for the second smoke control area which is to come into operation in October, 1961. Thirdly, Mr. Brown, a district Inspector, resigned in June in order to take up another appointment and was not replaced until August and no appointment has yet been made to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Mr. Webster. At the end of the year we were two Inspectors short of the normal establishment. Two student inspectors were engaged and together with a member of the clerical staff, are under training, but it will be some time before they are qualified Inspectors. In addition, two of the Inspectors are studying for additional qualifications and have consequently been away from normal duties at intervals. In these circumstances districts have had to be re-organised and enlarged with the consequence that routine visiting and inspection has suffered. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Council Bye-Laws. Rodent Control Two rodent operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out: — 15 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1960 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (i) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.(1), (2) & (3) Agricultural 29 17,828 3,581 21,438 1.

A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. 17 Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— Disinfestations. Premises 271 Rooms 276 Articles 12,078 Disinfections. Premises 113 Rooms 51 Articles 7,119 Library Books 26 Articles Destroyed 190 There was a small amount of disinfection undertaken on behalf of the Admiralty in respect of stores of bedding at the Royal Victoria Yard, Grove Street, Deptford, and £8 3s. sd. was received from the Admiralty. In addition, a local firm required bags to be steam disinfected before export and an amount of £13 15s. 0d. was received in respect of this service. Bathing Station Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 332 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 69 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies) 323 Baths (Old People) 25 Personal Hygiene treatment (Heads only) 29 Laundry The laundry service is for aged infirm people in the Borough, who are incontinent and who have difficulty in obtaining someone to wash and cleanse their bedclothes and personal underclothing, etc. The equipment consists of a Washing Machine, Hydro-extractor and Ironing Machine, and the work is carried out by the Bathing Station and Disinfecting staff. Number of patients 82 Number of collections and deliveries 3,438 Number of articles cleansed 21,448 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 18 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and sufficient water supply were issued in respect of 151 new premises. Clean Air Act, 1956 On the Ist October, 1960, the first Smoke Control Area in the Borough came into operation. The area, a comparatively small one, covers 43J acres, and includes 756 houses and flats, 8 commercial premises and one school. The majority of the preparation for this area was carried out by Mr. Webster, the Chief Public Health Inspector who retired in September. In February, 1960, in anticipation of Mr. Webster's retirement, Mr. Waring, a district Public Health Inspector, was detached from district duties and appointed Clean Air Officer, with certain duties connected with factories throughout the Borough. During the early part of the year, Mr. Waring was engaged in the inspection of houses on the proposed No. 2 Smoke Control Area which was in fact confirmed by the Minister on the sth December, 1960, and comes into operation in October, 1961. No. 2 Area is much larger, covering 267 acres and including 3,955 dwellings, 19 industrial premises, 63 commercial undertakings and 12 others. Mr. Waring's inspections and visits during 1960 are summarised as follows: — Smoke Control Order Inspections 1642 Calls 1330 Smoke observations 406 Complaints (Smoke nuisances) 30 Factory visits 87 Total 3495 A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building, and results and details are sent to the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich.

The requisitioned properties housed 165 units. During the year, 84 flats and maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 1,869 improvements were carried out in 702 houses, rather less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 144. Apart from the flats, etc., completed by the Council 53 flats and maisonettes were completed by the London County Council, and 14 houses were completed by private builders. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1960:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,230 Number of Statutory Notices served 260 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 702 There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. It is, however, the policy that when underground rooms become vacant, necessary action is taken to make the rooms fit before re-occupation. RENT ACT, 1957. During the year applications under the Act were received and dealt with as follows: — Applications by tenants for Certificates of Disrepair:— 35 (Granted 5. Undertakings given by landlords 29. Refused or withdrawn 1) Applications by landlords for Revocation of Certificates of Disrepair:— (Granted 10.

Refused 4) 14 Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 30 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES (London County Council) The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer (Dr. F. R. Waldron) are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics are as follows:— Health Centre, Amersham Road, 5.E.14. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal Clinics. Day Nursery. Artificial Sunlight, Simple Massage and Exercises Clinic. Special Investigation (Children Only) Clinic. Vaccination and Immunisation. Foot Clinic. Domestic Help Service, St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8. Ante-natal Clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square. Dental Clinic. Speech Therapy. Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic. Orthoptic Vision Clinic. Audiometry Minor Ailments Clinic. Minor Ailments Clinic. Welfare Foods Service National Welfare Food items are available for issue at the Health Centre, Amersham Road; Princess Louise Institute Clinic and St. Luke's Hall Clinic at certain times. These items are also available at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the Women's Voluntary Services, 302 New Cross Road, 5.E.14. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 32 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are usually sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1960 was 495, of which 258 were received from Greenwich, and 179 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 Is. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. 33 Six persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1960. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People During the year an additional Lady Visitor was appointed to assist with the visiting of old People. Four hundred and forty-five individual people were visited and a total of 3,677 visits paid. From this number 147 people were taken off the list for various reasons, e.g. admission to hospital or homes, removed from Borough, deaths, etc. and at the end of the year 298 people remained on the active visiting list. The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five "Darby and Joan" Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the District. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. I give details regarding our “Meals on Wheels' service which is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to over 300 old people each week. The meals are obtained from the United Girls Schools for Social Services at a cost of 1s. Bd. per meal, for which the individuals pay 10d. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of 10d. per meal. The Council pay the United Girls Schools monthly for the cost of the meals. 18,671 meals were provided during the year. The Deptford Borough Council maintain two vehicles and provide a driver, to deliver meals twice a week to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to "Darby and Joan" Clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Public Health Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation 34 maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of “break-point” chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Ilderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 42 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Sixty-two examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Registration of Hairdressers' Premises Fifty-six premises are registered under Section 18(1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Occasional inspections are made to ensure that the bye-laws are observed. Vaccination Certificates Two hundred and thirteen certificates by Medical Practitioners in respect of people travelling abroad were authenticated. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health—Torquay. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor R. S. Marriott, J. P.) and the Medical Officer of Health. National Society for Clean Air—Harrogate. Councillor Mrs. A. M. Ott. Public Health Inspectors' Association —Scarborough. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee and Mr. H. E. Green, Public Health Inspector.
