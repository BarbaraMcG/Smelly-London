Bark 43 BOROUGH OF BARKING. ANNUAL REPORT (ABRIDGED) ON THE HEALTH OF BARKING FOR THE YEAR 1949 by C.LEONARD WILLIAMS, B.Sc.,M.R.C.S.,L.R.C.P.,D.P.H. Medical Officer of Health. BARK 43 TOWN HALL BARKING,Essex November,1950 To The Mayor,Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Barking. Mr.Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have pleasure in submitting my report for the year ended 31st December,1949. I am, Mr.Mayor,Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, c.leshand willand Medical Officer of Health. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA, BIRTHS. The live birth rate for the year was 16.7 as compared with 18.7 for 1948. DEATHS. The number of Barking residents who died during the year was 735, an increase of 142 over the previous year. Of this total 384 occurred in the age group 65 years and over, and of these 204 were in respect of persons aged 75 years and over. Heart diseases accounted for nearly one third and cancer one seventh of the total deaths. INFANT MORTALITY. The infant mortality rate for Barking for 1949 was 24,80 as compared with 20.55 for the previous year. In 1949 the rate for England and Wales was 32 and for County Boroughs and Great Towns, including London, 37. The total number of deaths occurring in infants under one year of age was 33 and of those no loss than 21 died within the first month of life. Prematurity was again the chief cause of death and accounted for approximately one third of the cases. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT.1948. During the year one person was buried under Section 50 of this Act. It was not found necessary to invoke Section 47 of the Act, but throughout tho year wo were reminded by the many tragic cases coming to our notice of tho grave shortage of beds for the chronic sick and suitable and sufficient places for the aged and infirm. - 1 - GENERAL STATISTICS, 1949.

HEALTH CENTRES. During the year further progress was made with regard to earmarking sites for Health Centres. Recommendations have been made for five sites to bo reserved for Centres which will servo the five neighbourhood units into which the town is at present divided. In making these recommendations it was envisaged that the site chosen in the natural centre of the town, adjacent to existing hospital facilities, would bo for the major health centre of the town. During the year the five dental centres in the area operated as Health Centres, but the general dental service for which they were so designated Health Centres was reduced to a minimum, because of the shortage of dental officers and the need for ensuring adequate cover for the priority services. DAY NURSERIES, The great demand for Nursery places continued and throughout the year the average number of children awaiting admission was 411, whereas the total number of places available was 168. Every effort was made to forward the schemes for converting the former Castle School into a day nursery, and for erecting new premises on a site in St.Ann's Road. It is expected that the conversion of Castle School, which will provide 66 places, will be completed during 1950. With regard to Eastbury Day Nursery, which is accommodated in property belonging to the National Trust, the Trustees gave notice that the present tenancy of the premises for occupation as a Day Nursery would expire in May,1952. This Nursery provides 80 places and is at present the only nursery in the Western half of the town. DOMESTIC HELPS. Domestic Helps were mainly allocated to chronic sickness cases and to the aged. There was,however, an increased allocation to tubercular patients. There is need for the employment of male domestic helps to meet the needs of male chronic sick patients and aged men, particularly those living alone. - 6 - HEALTH VISITING.

During the year the District Nurses Home at 144/146 Longbridge Road opened, and has facilitated the nursing of cases in the Western half of the town. Male home nurses operated from this Home. INFANT WELFARE. It is estimated that of the children born during the year, over 90% attended infant welfare clinics. MIDWIFERY. The arrangements for domiciliary midwifery wore adequate. Close liaison between the Barking Maternity Hospital and the Ante-Natal Service was maintained, and the Medical Officers of that Hospital continued to undertake a significant number of ante-natal sessions in combined treatment centres. POST-NATAL CLINIC. The steady increase in the number of women attending the post-natal clinic was maintained, and during the year 1,101 cases attended. TOTAL CLINIC ATTENDANCES. The total attendances made to all clinics during the year was 170,206. - 7 - CHIROPODY. The popularity of this service was maintained and the following figures show the number of attendances made during the years- School Children 1,215 M.&.C.W. patients 78 Public Adult Scheme patients 21,455 IMMUNISATION, Diphtheria. The following table shows a comparison of the total immunised child population in 1949 as compared with 1948:- Age Group. 1948. 1949. 0-5 years 56.2% 57.2% 5-15 ,, 81.8% 83% 0-15 ,, 71.5% 73% During the year 2 cases of diphtheria occurred- both were non-immunised children and unfortunately one died. Whooping Cough. The demand for whooping cough immunisation continued and 1062 children were inoculated. A total of 225 children were notified during the year as suffering from whooping cough, but no deaths from this disease were recorded. - 8 - 9 DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION IN RELATION TO CHILD POPULATION.

STATISTICS. These will be found in the Appendix. CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. The rainfall for the year was 19.94" compared with 22.94" for the previous year. Barking is fortunate in being in one of the driest areas of the country,but is unfortunate in the fact that it suffers from atmospheric pollution, to which reference is made on pages , so that people living in the Borough are unable to get the maximum benefit from the sunshine available. WATER SUPPLY. There has been no change in the chemical quality of the water supply to the Borough, nor has there been any major extension of services. All the samples submitted, monthly for bacteriological examination and quarterly for chemical examination, have been found to be pure and wholesome. We still have need to complain of the hardness of the supply. RIVERS AND STREAMS. There was no serious flooding arising from any overflow of the rivers and streams in the Borough, but we did receive complaints as to the condition of the Mayesbrook watercourse, the River Roding and the River Thames. Negotiations were completed with the River Roding Catchment Board, the East Ham Corporation and frontagers for the filling in of the watercourse, known for a groat number of years as the Back River, which forms a boundary with East Ham on the western side of the Borough. The length of this stream was 740 yards. It is with pleasure I report the completion of this work, which resolved a nuisance which had existed for a number of years. During the year it was necessary to consult with the Essex County Council with regard to the pollution of the River Roding, and an inspection of tho Sewage Works delivering into that River was made in co-operation with their Officers. We were advised later of some necessary improvements which had been made at one of the Works. The offensive smells arising from the River Thames, and associated with the discharge of sewage effluents into the River, continued, and whilst there was no further deterioration in the chemical content of the River water, it was not possible to report 14 RIVERS AND STREAMS (contd) an improvement. I am aware that within the limits of money available the London County Council is continuing with the construction of now capital works for sewage disposal, but unless there is an increase in the speed with which this work is carried out, it does seem this nuisance will continue to cause discomfort to the residents of the Borough for a number of years. DRAINAGE AND SEWAGE. The whole of the drainage of the Borough is discharged to the Northern Outfall Works of the London County Council. There remains a small number of one-man trade premises at Rippleside where sanitary accommodation consists of a pail closet. The planning of this area has not yet been settled. PUBLIC CLEANSING. During the year 7,812 loads of refuse were collected with an average weight of 2.7 tons per load. It was with satisfaction from the public health standpoint that the Council ceased to collect food waste. If, for any national economic reasons, it should become necessary to reinstitute such a collection, I feel that this should not be done unless individual bins are provided for the use of every house. Private refuse tips - Essex County Council Act. 1933 Section 146. - Proceedings were instituted in connection with • contraventions at a private tip at Rippleside; a fine of £50 was imposed. Secondary Streets - I must still continue to report that the paving, lighting and drainage of those streets, which I regard as an urgent sanitary matter, has, by reason of the present economic stress, been left in abeyance. ERADICATION OF BED BUGS. There has been no important change in the position in the Borough, and whenever cases are brought to our notice disinfestation is carried out, and for this purpose an insecticide containing D.D.T. is used. The Housing Manager reports that 63 Corporation houses were treated during the year. 15 FLY NUISANCE. Special investigations were again carried out by Sanitary Inspectors of all places where flies were likely to breed, and particular attention was given to an area at Rippleside in the neighbourhood of a colony of 300 bungalows. A distribution of insecticide was made to the occupants of the bungalows, and a special spray treatment carried out in adjoining piggeries, stables and refuse tip where we found the source of the trouble. SMOKE MENACE. Monthly measurements of atmospheric pollution, both solid and gaseous, have been collected for a full year. The results demonstrate again the sharp rise in pollution in the winter months. Atmospheric pollution for the period October - March was 33% greater than that for the period April - September. The monthly supply of fuel used by factories for their industrial processes would be approximately constant throughout the year with a small increase in winter due to the need to heat the factory premises. The marked increase in the pollution of the atmosphere in the month of October is indicated in the table on page 18. This is the month when most people begin to light fires indoors, and it is reasonable to suppose that much of the increase may be attributed to domestic chimneys. There is no means of controlling pollution from this source by legal action, but efforts are being made both nationally and locally to encourage the use of smokeless fuels and the installation of grates suitable for this purpose. Houses now being erected by Local Authorities throughout the country are being equipped with grates capable of burning smokeless fuel, and it has been recommended by the Minister of Health that all houses reconditioned by a grant under the Housing Act, 1949, should bo similarly equipped. The burning of raw coal in inefficient open grates has long been considered wasteful. The old fashioned open grate has an efficiency of about 23% whilst a modern closable type of stove using smokeless fuel produces an efficiency of about 65% A vast amount of potential power is lost up the chimney in the form of unburnt gas, carbon and tar. It is the tarry content of domestic smoke which causes discolouration and disfigurntion of buildings duo to its adhesive nature. 16 Coal is a raw material from which can be produced a host of invaluable chemicals and compounds, including dyes,medicines, liquid fuels and gas, all of which are lost when coal is used in its raw state for heating. All factory chimneys in the area are kept under observation and contraventions of the byelaws have been dealt with. 298 observations of 30 minutes duration were made during the year and during these observations black smoke was emitted for a period of 134 minutes which represents an average of approximately minute in every 30 minutes observation. It has been found that contraventions are best dealt with by advice being given to factory owners by your officers who are suitably qualified for the work rather than by the institution of legal proceedings. In this way several improvements to furnace installations have been secured which have resulted in a reduction in smoke pollution of the atmosphere. Further progress in this direction is somewhat hampered by a long delay in the delivery of furnace equipment. This is specially true of installations designed to consume fuel such as wood chips and sawdust, several of which are to be found in the Borough. Unless strict attention is given to proper methods of stoking, these installations can cause nuisance from smoke or wood ash and your officers are alert to ensure that this necessary attention is given. Several installations are due for replacement as soon as more modern equipment becomes available. When such replacements are made, or when now installations are set up, efforts are made to secure plans of the boiler for approval prior to its erection. In this way it is possible to ensure that the boiler is of such design or is fitted with such equipment as will reduce the risk of atmospheric pollution to a minimum. That the task of reducing atmospheric pollution is an important one is obvious when one considers the large sum of money that has to be spent annually to make good the damage caused by smoke, and the many hours of cleaning made necessary by a dirty atmosphere. This has been estimated to be in the region of £100,000,000 per year. What is not always considered, however, is the interference by smoke with the beneficial ultra violet rays of the sun and the pollution of the soil which interferes with the growth of crops in gardens and allotments. 17 It has been demonstrated that the intensity of light in smoke polluted areas is only half that in a rural area, and that the ultra-violet radiation is reduced to an even greater degree. On many winter days the sun may bo observed as a red ball in the sky due to the fact that much of its power has been obscured by smoke particles. One of the most important positive values of sunlight is the way in which it promotes healthy bone growth in children. Adequate light promotes sturdy development and well-formed bodies preventing such deficiency diseases as rickets. It should not be necessary to take out children to the sea-side or to the country for sunshine and fresh air. These should be available all the year round in their home town. Sunlight is more directly essential to plant life than any other form of life, and in a smoky district the sunlight is not only reduced by the smoke haze, but also by the coating of soot that accumulates on the leaves. The result is that plants do not develop as they should. The remedy is to bo found in the co-operation of everyone, factory owners, engineers, stokers and householders to ensure that they are not responsible for pollution of the atmosphere.

RODENT CONTROL IN SEWERS. The biannual treatment of sewers was carried out during the months of May and November, Whilst the results on both occasions were satisfactory the evidence of heavy infestation in certain areas, most of which are in the older parts of the district, gives cause for serious thought. The following tables show the degree of infestation found to exist May Nevomber. Number of manholes baited 420 550 Number showing prebait take 279 260 Number showing complete prebait take. 166 106 Test baiting of 70 manholes throughout the newer parts of the district took place in April, and only evidence of minor infestation was found. Having regard to the result of the treatment in May, it was considered necessary to apply a special treatment to the sewers in the heavily infested areas. This was carried out with the approval of the Ministry in July using an alternative typo of bait base poison. The result of this treatment was as follows:- Number of manholes baited 210 Number of manholes showing prebait take 172 Number of manholes showing complete prebait take 102 A special record was made of the poison bait taken in these manholes as follows:- Number of manholes showing poison bait taken 130 Number of manholes showing complete bait taken 35 -19- SURFACE INFESTATION. In connection with the general surface infestation, the Corporation employs a trained rodent operative who has carried out 890 disinfestations as follows:- Factories and commercial premises 108 Private dwellings 232 Tips, open spaces, ditches and watercourses 72 Main and branch drains Corporation properties 39 Schools 10 Nurseries 2 This work involved over 4000 visits by the operative. The charge made by the Corporation for this service to factories and commercial premises is now at the rate of 4s. 3d. per man-hour, the managements of factories and business premises have continued to co-operate in this work, and the general public has taken advantage of the facilities offered. SWIMMING BATHS AND POOIS. the inadequate swimming facilities in Barking have caused concern to the Council for many years, and it is unfortunate that the proposed bath in Mayesbrook Park still had to be postponed. East Street Bath. This indoor bath was used by 74,588 bathers in the short season of 21 weeks, which constituted a record. It is pleasing to learn from the report submitted to the Council that 21,000 bathers were children, and whilst this is commendable, it does increase the problem of dealing with the pollution load using the present purification plant# Open Air Pool. the statistics submitted to the Council showed a welcome increase in the bathers attending the Open Air Pool, due to the excellent weather. There was a record attendance of 119,734 bathers for the season. -20- Generally, I can say that I look forward to the time when the now swimming bath is established, and provision made either centrally or in some part of the Borough for Turkish and vapour baths. Samples of swimming bath water were taken as below:- Number. Open Air Pool 6 East Street Bath 6 South East Essex County Technical College 7 FACTORIES ACT. 1937. In the Appendix will bo found statistics in relation to the administration of this Act. Out-workers. A fire occurred in a room where out-work was being carried on, causing the death of the outworker. The deceased was engaged in fixing rubber soles to shoes with an adhesive solution. the facts of this tragedy were reported to the Home Office. Arising from this incident the Council took proceedings against the employer of the out-worker who had failed to give notice in accordance with the Factories Act, 1937. The Magistrates imposed a fine of 40/-. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. During the year the Sanitary Inspectors dealt with 1414 complaints which resulted in the service of 1041 Statutory Notices. At the end of the year there were 290 Statutory Notices outstanding. During the year work had been completed on 924 Statutory Notices and 897 preliminary Notices. MAINTENANCE REPORTS, Reference must be made to the difficulty in dealing with maintenance repairs. An appeal against a Notice under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, on the grounds that the premises in question could not be repaired at a reasonable cost was made by the owner. It was urged on behalf of the Council that the premises could be repaired for an outlay of £60, but the Appellant claimed that the cost of discharging the Notice would be £139. -21- It was agreed that the value of the house on completion of repairs would bo £150. There were throe appearances at the County Court and the finding of the Judge was - "Having heard and considered all the evidence I accept as accurate the estimate that to execute the works specified in the Corporation's Notice will cost £139, and I find that to execute the works necessary to render this house fit for human habitation will cost such sum of £139. The result is that by expending the sum of £139 the Owners will have a house which will bo worth the agreed figure of £150. It will be observed that as the Ownor's net profit from the house thereafter will bo the agreed sum of £6 per annum, it will take 23 years before they will recover their expenditure of £139. It will also be observed that by expending £139 the Owners will increase the value of the house from its present agreed figure of £100 to £150 an increase in value of £50. On the whole facts I find that the house cannot bo rendered fit for human habitation at a reasonable expense." Notwithstanding this decision the owner shortly afterwards carried out the works required by the Notice. the date of the Notice under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, was 14.9.48., and the works were completed in May,1950. Throughout this period the tenant was in occupation of the unsatisfactory promises, DUSTBINS. Since 1943 the Council have operated Section 75 (3) of the Public Health Act, 1936, and have supplied dustbins to any promises needing them, and at the same time giving notice to the owner. It was necossary to raise the annual charge for the maintenance of dustbins supplied to the sum of 5/-. This resulted in an appeal by many owner/occupiers for permission to withdraw from the "Council's Dustbin Schome", as it was called. It also created difficulties with owners of small cottages who felt aggrieved that they should be called upon to pay the additional charge. The controversial issue as to responsibility for the maintenance of dustbins is one which I should be pleased to see resolved. -22- ■ : CHEMICAL WORKS. Over a number of years, commencing from about 1933, the Council has received from residents in the neighbourhood of a factory situated on the site of the old Gas Works in Abbey Road, complaints of nuisances from fumes, smoke and noise, which they allege are produced by the operations of the factory and other works associated with it. These complaints have been pressed strongly during the last two years. The Public Health Committee appointed a sub-committee to discuss with the management what steps could be taken to mitigate the nuisance. The works have also been visited by the Alkali Works Inspectors of the Ministry of Health. the situation of the works is such that in the built-up area where the complainants reside nuisance is to be expected, and indeed, where such chemical processes are concerned, is impossible to avoid entirely. The real answer to the problem is for the factory to be re-sited. This,however, is Impossible with the present economic difficulties. MASSAGE & SPECIAL TREATMENT ESTABLISHMENT - ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL ACT,1933, PART IV. there were three such premises licenced under this Act. Inspections have been made to ensure that the byelaws are complied with. RENT & MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACTS.1920 TO 1939. During the year two Certificates were issued under these Acts. HOUSING. STATISTICS. Your Chief Sanitary Inspector, who is Rehousing Officer for the Borough, has supplied the statistics, to be found in the Appendix, which show the detailed position in the Borough at the end of the year. POST-WAR HOUSING. Progress has continued with the Council's schemes. The majority of the building has been at Longbridge Road where there are 400 flats under construction. During the year the Council agreed in principle to the development of an area situated in the southern part of the Borough, but at the time of writing Ministerial consent has not been received for its use for housing purposes. It is important, if further building is to take place, that a decision should be obtained so soon as possible. -23- ■ . Clearance Areas and Re-Housing. It was not possible during the year to continue the re-development of the clearance areas in respect of which Orders were made early in 1939. Nevertheless, every attempt was made to maintain a reasonable standard of comfort for the 150 families living in the houses concerned. THE AGED AND THE TUBERCULAR. The problem of dealing adequately with the tubercular and the aged continues to receive the serious consideration of the Council, and whilst a start has not boon made on the building of the special hostel for the aged, the Council have proceeded so far as they can with the preliminary arrangements for this scheme. The additional 15 points awarded to the applications of tuberculous families is a substantial bonus, and does have the effect of securing the rehousing of all urgent cases. HUTTED CAMPS. During the year there was an increase in the number of families remaining in occupation of temporary dwellings. In order to relievo the acute overcrowding and as an emergency measure, the Council continued the conversion of a Ministry of Works hutted camp into housing units. As a result of our earlier experience with this type of converted dwelling, improvements were incorporated. Huts were divided by brick partition walls, and each family was provided with a bathroom and w.c. built into the unit, separate and under cover. In addition constant hot water supply was available from gas-heaters over sink and bath. The families in occupation of the accommodation were satisfied with this temporary rehousing at a rent of 10s. per week for two bedroom units. The number of complaints subsequently received have been few and have related to the ingress of dampness from roofs and windows in times of storm. -24- \ The following details of hutted camps are given:- Gunsite hutments 124 Huts for homeless 50 Thames Road conversions 54 The huts house a population of 795 persons, INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. FOOD HYGIENE. The year has seen remarkable achievements in the restoration of war damaged food promises, Plate glass windows have again become normal and in general the shops have regained their pre-war appearance. It is pleasing to record that refrigerators have now become accepted as a standard fitment to any establishment where meat and other similar foods are stored for sale. Progress has also been made in fostering the co-operation of trade operatives and managements to raise the standard of cleanliness in food premises. Regular and frequent visits by your sanitary inspectors, who keep constant contact with all concerned, strengthen this desire for co-operation on both sides, FOOD POISONING. An increase in the number of notified cases of food poisoning is recorded. In all there were 39 cases which, upon investigation, were found to arise mainly from cockles which had been taken from an area under the control of the Port of London Authority. In investigating the matter 27 samples of cockles, obtained from local retailers, were submitted for bacteriological examination at the Central Public Health laboratories, who were unable to indicate any specific causative agent. SAMPLING. During the year 313 samples were submitted to chemical analysis, details of which are set out in the Appendix. The following five samples were reported to be unsatisfactory and were dealt with as shown overleaf. -25- Sugar - contained an admixture of approximately 14$ of potash alum. Bread - contained a piece of dirty dough. Beer - contained an excessive amount of load contamination. Salad Contravened Food Standards (Salad Cream Cream - and Mayonnaise) Order,1945, i.e., contained 22$ by weight of oil instead of required 25$. Cocktail Tonic - contravened Section 4 (iv) of the Food labelling Order,1946, i.e., found to be a non-alcoholic preparation and no appreciable quantity of fruit or vegetable juice present. In each instance appropriate action was taken. ICE CREAM SAMPLES - CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. There were 53 samples of ice cream analysed. It is gratifying to report that the improvement in the quality continues. Total Solids. Fat. Average sample contained 31.42% 8.86% Highest quality sample contained 37.90% 15.25$ Lowest quality sample contained 24.60% 2.90% The above figures support the argument expressed so frequently by you for a much higher fat content in all ice cream retailed. ICE CREAM SAMPLING - BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION. 105 samples of ice cream were bacteriologically examined. It is also the practice to submit these samples to the Ministry of Health Provisional Mothylene Blue Reduction Test for which the following results were obtained:- Satisfactory Unsatisfactory Bacteriological Examination: 84 21 Grades I & II Grades III & IV. Ministry of Health Provisional Mothylene Blue Reduction Test: 86 19 -26- MILK SUPPLY. In the area there are 31 promises registered for the retail sale of pro-packed supplies. There are six large purveyors of milk - one has premises in the district for the storage of milk only. Other than a small quantity of certified farm bottled milk, all the milk retailed is heat-treated. There were 75 samples of milk submitted to Methylene Blue Reduction Test, with phosphatase examination, of which 6 were reported unsatisfactory. the unsatisfactory samples occurred during the hot summer weather. A further 72 samples of milk were submitted for biological examination. Seventy were reported free from tuberculosis. In one instance the sample bottle was broken in transit and in another case the guinea-pig died prematurely. -27- APPENDIX. SANITARY INSPECTION (i) Inspection of Dwelling-Houses.
