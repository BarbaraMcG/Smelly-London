Me. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to submit ray Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health and School Medical Officer for the year 1941. In accordance with the direction of the Ministry of Health and the Board of Education the Report has been abbreviated as far as possible. The birth rate, 13.31 per thousand of the population, is slightly less than that (14.02) of the previous year; but slightly greater than the rates of the six years preceding the outbreak of war. The comparative rate for England and Wales is 14.2. The general death rate (13.46) shows a decrease compared with that (16.2) of the previous year. The infantile mortality rate (38.30 per thousand live births) is the second lowest ever recorded in the Borough, and compares favourably with the rate of 59 for England and Wales. No Leyton mother died during the year due to diseases or accidents of pregnancy or childbirth. Since the outbreak of war the incidence of notifiable infectious disease has been unexpectedly and inexplicably low. For instance, during the year under review the incidence of both scarlet fever and diphtheria have been less than a quarter of the incidence during the last complete pre-war year. The Department under my control has continued to be responsible for the civil defence casualty service, and for the medical and nursing arrangements in public shelters; but as these activities and duties are not included by the Ministry of Health among the subjects to be dealt with by the Medical Officers of Health in their annual reports, no reference is made to them. 5 It is with gratitude that I acknowledge the continued loyal co-operation and industry of the members of the staff of the Health Department. It is also my privilege to acknowledge again the support accorded to me by the Chairman and Members of the Committee concerned with the work of the Health Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, 6 Extract from Vital Statistics for the year 1941.

There are three registered nursing homes in the Borough. These institutions were inspected on 8 occasions. 35 Home Helps. Under the Council's scheme for the provision of home helps' 154 applications for home helps were dealt with. In 112 cases (10 of whom made application in 1940), home helps were provided, 19 of these cases having the charges remitted in accordance with the Council's scale. In the 52 remaining cases, 8 made other arrangements for the confinement, 13 removed or were evacuated, and 31 cases had not been confined at the end of the year. Puerperal Pyrexia. Thirteen cases of puerperal pyrexia were notified during the year.

The advice of the Council's Consultant Obstetrician was not sought during the year. Maternity Mortality. There were no maternal deaths of Leyton residents during the year. Medical Aid. In accordance with the Rules of the Central Midwives' Board, a midwife must notify the Local Supervising Authority within 36 hours of every occasion on which she sends for medical aid. One hundred and twenty-nine such notifications were received. 36 Fees paid to Doctors under Section 14 (1) of the Midwives' Acts, 1918. One hundred and one accounts were received from general medical practitioners for assistance rendered to midwives under the provisions of this section. The total amount paid to medical practitioners during the year was £188 12s. Od. Assisted Milk Supply. During 1941 the arrangements for assisted milk supply were continued under the National Milk Scheme and carried out by the Food Executive Officer. Pre-natal Clothing Coupons. On 21st July, 1941, the Ministry of Health in Circular 2437 requested Local Authorities to undertake the distribution of clothing coupons to expectant mothers. From the commencement of the scheme in August until the end of the year, 696 expectant mothers were issued with the required coupons. Distribution of Fruit Juices and Cod Liver Oil. On 5th November, 1941, the Ministry of Health notified Local Authorities in Circular 2520 that, in consultation with the Minister of Food, he had arranged for the issue to all children under the age of two years of preparations of Fruit Juices and Cod Liver Oil. After conferring with the Local Food Executive Officer and the Baths Superintendent, arrangements were made for these preparations to be distributed from the Public Baths, High Road, E.10, and the Public Baths, Cathall Road, E.11.

It is not claimed that artificial immunisation will prevent a person from infection by diphtheria organisms. What is claimed is that successful artificial immunisation will prevent the immunised person from developing the dangerous toxæmic manifestations of diphtheria. During 1941 one Leyton child, who had been immunised previously, was notified to be suffering from diphtheria. The following table gives in summary form the information regarding this case. Age. Sex.

During the year 2,072 children attended the clinic, and 8,822 attendances were registered. Defective Vision.—Of the 2,065 children subjected to routine code group inspection in the schools, 118 (5.7 per cent.) were found to be suffering from some eye defect requiring treatment. Special Eye Clinic.— During the year, the Ophthalmic Surgeon had referred to him 462 children, who made 570 attendances for examination and treatment. Report by the Authority's Ophthalmic Surgeon (J. D. Magor Cardell, M.B., B.S., F.R.C.S.). During the year a total of 539 children were examined. It appears that war time conditions have had no decided ill effect upon the eyes of the school children and I am surprised at the absence of neurosis. The difficulty of securing accommodation for such children as require operation for squint has slowed up the treatment of squints and increased the difficulties of the squint clinic. A solution which I believe to be satisfactory has now been arrived at with the kindly co-operation of the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital. This should enable the waiting list to be shortened considerably. Squint Clinic. Report by Orthoptist (Miss G. Montague Smith). During the past year the Orthoptic Clinic has been working to its fullest capacity—attendances increased since 1940 by 231— cases requiring operation have unfortunately had to wait a long time owing to the difficulty of finding beds, therefore this report cannot record their results. 50 I.

E. Hall, L.D.S.) Leyton Elementary Schools. The treatment figures (see page 60) show an increase over the previous year—mainly in inspections, in children attending the treatment centres, and in conservative dentistry. The extractions found to be necessary, and consequently the anaesthetics administered, were fewer. It is satisfactory to record that during the war the percentage of acceptance of treatment has increased as follows:— 1939 45.6 per cent. 1940 54.9 per cent. 1941 58.39 per cent. Leyton County High School for Boys. When this school was inspected in February, 1941, the general return to the Borough had not set in, and only about 50 per cent. of the number inspected the previous year were found to be in attendance. Since that time, and mainly during the latter half of 1941, the number in attendance has increased until at the end of the year the figure was rapidly approaching that of the early part of 1940. No comparison with the dental findings of previous years has been made as the school is now composed of both Leyton and Walthamstow boys. School Children Evacuated to Essex. The amount of work carried out by our Dental Officer working part time in the County of Essex has fallen during 1941, due to the return of children to Leyton, and also by further evacuation from the Epping, Harlow and Brentwood areas to other counties. This Dental Officer's time in the County, compared to his time in Leyton, was in the proportion of 1 : 8. A table is attached giving a resume of this work. These figures are not included in Table IV (Appendix) for either Elementary or Secondary School children. 52 Secondary. Elementary.

Following the destruction by enemy action of the Orthopaedic and Artificial Sunlight Clinics at Knotts Green Special School, arrangements were made for the clinics to be held at Leyton Green Health Centre ; and sessions have been held there regularly since March, 1941. The following figures show the number of school children examined and treated during the year. Examinations. Primary examinations 38 Re-examinations 87 53 Treatment.
