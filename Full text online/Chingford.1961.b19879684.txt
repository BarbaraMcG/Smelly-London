ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1961 To: The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Chingford Corporation. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have pleasure in submitting my Annual Report for the year 1961 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough. The year was marked by the retirement of Mr. J.F. Rogers, Chief Public Health Inspector, who had held this post for nearly 32 years. Many tributes were paid to him by Committees and Council on the occasion. Vital Statistics: In the statistics which follow, the figures in brackets refer to 1960. The birth-rate was 13.3 per 1,000 (13.1). representing 612 births (607). The number of deaths was 407 (352). The death rate was 8.8 per 1,000 (7.6). To allow for differing sex and age distribution of local populations, comparability factors are supplied by the General Register Office. These factors enable adjustments to be made in birth and death rates so that comparisons can be made with other areas and with England and Wales as a whole. (See table on page 4) The infant mortality rate was 16.3 (16.4), the rate for England and Wales being 21.4 The table on page 4 shows at a glance the birth and death rates for the years 1956 - 1961. Causes of Death: Diseases of the heart and arteries, and cancer, caused 203 and 87 deaths respectively, these conditions being the principal causes of death. Infectious Diseases:A large outbreak of measles occurring late in 1960 and carrying well into 1961 accounted for most of the infectious disease notifications. Chiropody Service: It was unfortunately necessary to curtail the chiropody service sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee, owing to the resignation of one of the two chiropodists 2. taking part in the scheme. New Legislation in 1961: New legislation included: Housing Act, 1961 Public Health Act, 1961 Dr. F.G. Drown, Area Medical Officer, has kindly supplied the statistical matter on pages 5 and 6. In conclusion, I would like to record my thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Health Committee for their support and to the staff of the Department for their co-operation during the year. J. H.

(h) Hospitals The hospitals providing general medical services for Chingford residents are chiefly the Chingford Hospital, the Connaught Hospital, Walthamstow, the Wanstead Hospital, the North Middlesex Hospital, Edmonton, and the Whipps Cross Hospital, Leytonstone. Persons with infectious disease needing admission to hospital are accommodated at Isolation Hospitals in nearby districts, viz: St. Ann's Hospital, Tottenham, South Lodge Hospital, Winchmore Hill; or, if no bed is available at these hospitals, the Emergency Bed Service arranges admiasion to the nearest hospital where a bed is available. The infectious disease unit at the Honey Lane Hospital, Waltham Abbey, was closed by the Regional Hospital Board as from 25th July, 1961, to provide accommodation for oral surgery. (i) Day Nurseries There is one Day Nursery in the district, situated at 136/138, Chingford Mount Road. Regular medical inspection of the children attending this Nursery was carried out during the year. (j) Home and Domestic Help Scheme There is a Home and Domestic Help Scheme in the Chingford district, under the auspices of the Essex County Council. Application for these facilities should be made to the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. (k) Chiropody Facilities Chiropody sessions are now held at both Essex County Health Services Clinics in the area. Priority is, in the first instance, given to the elderly, the physically handicapped and expectant mothers. Appointments for such treatment must be made through the Area Medical Officer, Municipal Offices, High Road, Woodford, E.18. There were 23 new applicants in 1961 for treatment under the scheme for providing chiropody for Chingford residents of pensionable age, sponsored by the Chingford Old People's Welfare Committee and administered by the Health Department. Since the scheme began in 1956, 662 persons have applied for treatment. Four persons hold licences from the Essex County Council to carry on private practice as chiropodists in the borough. Their premises are inspected annually. 8.

SECTION C PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES Diphtheria There were no cases of diphtheria during the year. The last case occurred in 1950. Primary and secondary immunisation against this disease was carried out to the following extent in children under 15 years of age:- Primary immunisations - under 5 years - 567 " „ - 5 to 15 years - 53 Total - 620 Number receiving secondary or reinforcing injections - 451 Scarlet Fever Scarlet Fever was again of a mild character. There were not more than 30 cases. It is very rare for scarlet fever patients to require hospital treatment at the present day, and none of the 30 cases mentioned above needed admission to hospital. The following table indicates the cases notified during the past five years and the percentage of cases removed to hospital:- 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Confirmed cases 54 37 78 138 30 Percentage removed to hospital 9 nil 5 3 nil Measles This was by far the most prevalent of the infectious illnesses, with 1,101 notifications. Six of them were admitted to hospital. Measles serum was available to medical practitioners on application to the Public Health Laboratory, Colindale, for the treatment of cases and protection of contacts. Whooping Cough Notifications totalled 26 during the year. The number of children receiving a full course of immunisation against this condition in 1961 was 230. 11. Acute Poliomyelitis It is very gratifying that again there were no cases in the borough. Vaccination against this disease was accepted and carried out as follows:- No, receiving the two primary injections - 1,605 No. receiving the third injection - 1,652 No. receiving fourth injection (special - 2,111 category, children between 5 & 12 years) Tuberculosis A further slight reduction in fresh cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, there being 13 cases, continued the downward trend that has occurred since the end of the war. The following table indicates this point:- Year: 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 Cases: 46 42 34 36 44 30 39 30 20 Year: 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 Cases: 20 32 17 21 14 13 However, the formidable task confronting the nation in the control and eradication of tuberculosis will be appreciated when it is realised that in England and Wales last year there were 19,187 new and confirmed cases of this disease. Tuberculosis is still very much with us. In the school health service, a very large increase took place in the number of children who received B.C.G. vaccination, the figures being 420 against only 280 in 1960. This is most gratifying and encouraging. The Walthamstow and Chingford Association of Tuberculosis Care Helpers gave assistance wherever possible to patients and their families who suffered financial loss through the need for prolonged treatment at home or in hospital. This assistance was mostly in the form of groceries, fuel, clothing and holidays. The contribution of £30 which the Chingford Borough Council makes annually to this Association is very much appreciated. Dysentery There were 7 cases. Food Poisoning Six cases were notified. Salmonella typhimurium organisms were found in four of them. 12. Food Hygiene The Health Inspectors continued their close attention to all food premises in the borough. Vaccination Primary vaccinations against smallpox during the year totalled 520, the number of revaccinations being 162. National Assistance Act, 1948 (a) Section 47: Care of Aged and Chronic Sick. No cases needed statutory action under Section 47. In several instances the provision of a home help obviated the need for hospital care or admission to an old persons' home. (b) Section 50: Two burials were arranged by the Council under this section, the cost being fully recovered in both cases. Medical Examinations During the year 130 examinations were carried out by me in respect of Chingford Council staff and 26 in respect of staff of the Essex County Council.

SECTION D SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supplies A hard, pure and constant piped water supply is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board who regularly sample and test. The supply has been satisfactory in both quality and quantity, and is not liable to plumbo-solvent action. No action was necessary in respect of contamination and the whole of the dwelling houses in the Borough are supplied from public water mains. Rivers and Streams Fifteen visits were made during the year in connection with the pollution of water courses. Informal action secured the abatement of minor instances of pollution, Sewerage and Sewage Disposal The Borough Engineer reports as follows:- "Sewerage - with the exception of one area where surcharging occurs in exceptionally wet weather the sewerage of the district is satisfactory. Sewage Disposal - the present works are expected to become redundant in about 1965 when all sewage from the Borough of Chingford will be treated at the Edmonton Works of the Middlesex County Council. In the meantime during periods of drought or of heavy rain the present works which are of only about half the required capacity are unable to produce a first class effluent, despite the fact that a substantial amount of the dry weather flow is now being pumped to the Edmonton Works. It is essential because of the deteriorating condition of the Works that nothing should be allowed to delay the transfer of the sewage to the Edmonton Works." 19. Public Cleansing (a) Refuse Collection A regular weekly collection was maintained and 11,140 tons of town refuse and salvage were collected from 14,826 premises by 23 men divided amongst six teams, five of which used 'side loaders' and one a dual tip vehicle. Four of the refuse freighter fleet were powered by diesel engines. Trailers were used for salvage collection. (b) Refuse Disposal All refuse is taken to the Refuse Works where salvage is extracted and the tailings incinerated. The resultant clinker, together with some types of trade refuse, is removed by contractors to a tip outside the Borough. The disposal plant is unsatisfactory, being inadequate and worn out. Furthermore it is sited in a residential area. The Council were concerned about the condition of the works and proposed to substitute a loading bay for the incinerator, this work being phased to commence in the financial year 1961/62. Refuse would then, after extraction of salvage, be removed from the loading bay by contractors and disposed of outside the district. In September 1961 the Minister of Housing and Local Government asked Local Authorities to check public expenditure wherever possible and the Council resolved to defer this scheme until the financial year 1963/64. (c) Collection and Disposal Costs The net expenditure for the collection and disposal of refuse and salvage, including loan charge, for the financial year 1961/62 was £27,010 or 48/5d. per ton compared with £23,079 or 39/5d. per ton for the previous year. (d) Street Cleansing This service is carried out by a force of twelve men working in three gangs, each gang being provided with an electric truck. The establishment allows for six further sweepers to cover holidays, sickness and to provide replacements for the refuse collection service. Recruitment of suitable and sufficient labour was extremely difficult and seldom was the full complement available. Despite this the roads were kept reasonably clean and only fell badly into arrears following heavy snow gritting and in the autumn leaf fall.
