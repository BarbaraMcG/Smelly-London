ELLIS (Rodent Operative.) 6 To the Chairman and Members of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen. Under the terms of Ministry of Health Circular 1/1954. I submit my Annual Report on the Health of the district during the year 1953. It will be my last Annual Report and it is. perhaps, opportune that I should "sum up " my belief that, in so far as Chislehurst and Sidcup is concerned, most of the Public Health problems that confronted the Public Health Committees many years ago have been eliminated. A greater Public Health conscience has been established—as an example, we no longer see such notices in public conveyances as "Do not spit!" The common infectious diseases have lost their sting; food is produced and handled under vastly improved conditions ; the homes and the environment of the people at home and at work have improved beyond measure; the expectation of life has been lengthened and the new young life saved from death. The child at school has improved in health and in height and weight and is clean and free of gross verminous conditions. As the old problems are solved, so do new problems arise. We know that the "stress" diseases, e.g., cardiovascular, duodenal ulceration, are on the increase. A new approach to Public Health is needed if we are to cope with the stress and strain of modern urban life. We know that there is an increase in deaths from cancer of the lung, which, so far as we are able to judge, calls for cleansing the air that reaches our lungs of all possible carcinogenic factors. We must learn afresh that, although the ways of prevention are hard, they are necessary if we are to combat the ever rising demands on the treatment services. We still need " one home, one family " if we are to build up and maintain " family unity." around which all Health Services must evolve. Government of local affairs must be local, especially in those services which are applicable to the family, and we must give continuous encouragement to the voluntary agencies who are doing so much for the advancement of the social and health services. The General Practitioner must be brought into the Public Health and Preventive Medical services for it is he who has the key to the family health. The census of 1951 indicates that there is more "over crowding" in Chislehurst and Sidcup than in either of their neighbouring authorities, thus Chislehurst and Sidcup has 0.77 persons per room, compared with 0.67 in Bromley and 0.70 in Orpington. Further. 1.65% of the Chislehurst and Sidcup population live more than two persons per room, compared with 0.93% in Bromley and 0.86% in Orpington. It is. however, interesting to note that Chislehurst and Sidcup have 1.701 households sharing 7 dwellings, compared with 3.472 households in Bromley and 971 households in Orpington. 9.9% of Chislehurst and Sidcup population are under five years of age, compared with 8% in Bromley and 6% in Orpington. At the other end of the age scale. Chislehurst and Sidcup have 8.1% over 65 years, Bromley 12.6% and Orpington 10.4%. All these statistics are of value, especially when comparing the sickness rates and death rates of one authority with another ; they are also of importance in indicating the extent and direction in which social and health services are needed. Further delving into the 1951 census shows that in Chislehurst and Sidcup, there are 2,202 households without a fixed bath, 161 without a piped water supply in the dwelling. 164 without a cooking stove, and 263 without a kitchen sink. These figures are, however, to be taken with some reserve, as they are liable to the human error of interpretation in the compilation of the census papers. 1953. from the Public Health viewpoint, was uneventful and the body of the report will indicate the work that has been carried out by the Department. The Chief Sanitary Inspector. Mr. A. V. B. Allen, is happily back after a prolonged period of illness. Mr. Watling. the Chief Clerk in the Department since June, 1946. and who had done so much voluntary Red Cross work in the district, died on the 22nd January, 1954. I would commend to the Council all the members of the Health Department who have carried the task so ably during a difficult staffing year. I would express my personal indebtedness to the local authority for being so patient with me in my endeavours to advise them over the past six years. I am. Your obedient Servant. K. E. TAPPER, MAY, 1954. Medical Officer of Health. SECTION A. VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. 10 SECTION A. VITAL AND OTHER STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

The Registrar General's estimate of total population (civilian and non-civilian) of the Urban District, mid-year 1953. is 85.290 an increase of 160 over the year 1952. This population gives a density of 9.5 persons to the acre. The natural increase of population (measured by excess of births over deaths) for the year was 559. BIRTHS. The Birth Rate for 1953 is 15.1 per 1.000 total population, which is the same as that for the previous year, and compares favourably with the rate of 15.5 for England and Wales. 1,291 live births were registered during the year, there being 641 males and 650 females. The average yearly Birth Rate during the past ten years was 17.3. Illegitimate Births. The illegitimate birth rate (per 1.000 live and still births) for 1953. is 40.2. There were 53 illegitimate births (23 males and 30 females). Stillbirths. The stillbirth rate for 1953. is 22.0 per 1.000 live and still births, and 0.34 per 1.000 total population. There were 29 stillbirths in the area (28 legitimate and 1 illegitimate). DEATHS. The Death Rate for the year 1953 is 8.6 per 1,000 total population. There were 732 deaths registered (after adjustment for inward and outward transfers). Of this number. 382 were males and 350 females. The rate for England and Wales is 11.4. An analysis of the ages at death shows that of the deaths registered:— Male. Female. 30 were under 1 year of age 14 16 6 were 1 and under 5 years of age 4 2 8 were 5 and under 15 years of age 4 4 6 were 15 and under 25 years of age 4 2 51 were 25 and under 45 years of age 25 26 154 were 45 and under 65 years of age 94 60 194 were 65 and under 75 years of age 115 79 283 were 75 years of age and over 122 161 382 350 12 CAUSATION OF DEATHS. Main causes of death in Chislehurst and Sidcup during the year 1953, together with comparative rates per 1,000 total population for the last five years, were:— 1949. 1950. 1951. 1952. 1953. Cancer 102 131 132 127 154 Respiratory Diseases (not Tuberculosis) 55 59 89 72 80 Heart and Circulatory Diseases 257 330 361 377 325 Tuberculosis 35 30 30 22 20 Infectious Diseases 15 8 4 4 3 Road Traffic Accidents 7 5 6 4 9 Other Violent Causes 11 12 12 10 7 Suicide 4 7 9 8 13 Digestive Diseases 13 18 18 11 17 Other Causes 83 82 96 104 104 582 682 757 739 732 CANCER OF THE LUNG. During the years 1950/53. one hundred and twelve persons have died of cancer of the lung. This cause of death has increased in recent years. In 1950. it was thirty-one. and in 1953. thirty-eight. This increase may be due to better diagnosis, but the general opinion is that it is an actual increase of the disease throughout the country. No other form of cancer shows a like increase. Investigations as to the reason for this increase are actively proceeding under the direction of the Medical Research Council, and it is too early yet to say whether it is due to excessive smoking or to carcinogenic factors in the atmosphere. However, a field for prevention lies open. MATERNAL MORTALITY. There were no maternal deaths in the Urban District during 1953. INFANTILE MORTALITY. The Infant Mortality Rate for the year is 24.0 per 1,000 live births. Thirty-one infants died during the year before reaching their first birthday. Of this number, 29 were legitimate and 2 illegitimate. There were 21 neonatal deaths (under 1 month of age). UNEMPLOYMENT. I am indebted to the Manager of the Local Employment Exchange for the following information:— " The position in 1953 has been much the same as in 1952. Unemployment has been slight and. in the main, due to slackness of trade in other areas. For the fit and able man or woman prepared to work in London, there have been, generally speaking, reasonable opportunities of work." 13 LOCAL SICKNESS. The following is a summary of the information received from the Regional Office of the Ministry of National Insurance, which indicates for the area, numbers of "First Certificates" of sickness benefit received at the Local Office. Whilst these figures give some indication of the major trend of sickness in the area, they must not be taken as being exact as the area for the Ministry statistics is not quite the same as that covered by the Urban District. 1953.

The W.V.S. carry out a great deal of work in connection with the Welfare of Old People and in co-operation with the Old People's Welfare Committee. They are responsible for the Darby and Joan Club at Blackfen. which has a membership of over two hundred, and their members regularly visit old people and do shopping, etc., for them. Four meals on wheels, one day a week, are delivered on the St. Paul's Cray Estate, by the Orpington Branch. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP VOLUNTARY TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE. This Committee is continuing to render very valuable assistance to T.B. patients and their families in this district. 18 The Committee's Liaison Officer is available three afternoons each week at the United Services' Club. 108. Main Road. Sidcup. when patients or their families can seek her help on the many problems which arise during long illnesses. That the public is sympathetic to the work of this Committee is clear from the fact that over 6.000 people in the district contribute to their funds by purchasing Christmas Seals which provide the main source of the Committee's income. Approximately 340 cases were assisted and 500 visited and interviewed. The Committee has been able to extend its activities to include the provision of free holidays at the seaside for a number of families, which enable tired wives and mothers to have a complete rest from home and financial worries. All statutory and voluntary bodies in the district give the utmost co-operation to the Care Committee, and the closest liaison exists with the Chest Clinic and with hospitals. CHISLEHURST AND SIDCUP OLD PEOPLE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE. Abstract from Secretary's Annual Report:— " The thirteen clubs, established over the past seven years in the Chislehurst and Sidcup district, continue to bring friendship and a wide variety of activity and interest to the thousand elderly people who attend them weekly. Holidays. Approximately 120 members availed themselves of this scheme and holidays were enjoyed in April and May at Bognor, Bexhill and Eastbourne for 3 guineas a week. Experimental Laundry Scheme. This has been arranged for a trial period of six months to handle soiled bed-linen of the aged and incontinent sick. Queen Mary's Hospital has agreed to undertake this work and Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council has agreed to collect and deliver. The patient will have to be inadmissable to a County Home for Old People on the grounds of incontinence and the linen must have been refused by an ordinary laundry. The patient will normally be of pensionable age and a certificate must be obtained from the doctor stating that such help is needed. House for Conversion into Single-Room Flatlets. Accommodation for Old People is a continual cause of concern to the Central Committee. For some time, the Honorary Treasurer has kept in a separate Post Office Savings Account, sums of money, set aside for the purpose of making some contribution to the 19 housing of old people in the district. Considerable interest was aroused in January of this year by an account given by Miss Ellis, of the Lewisham Old People's Housing Association, of a highly successful House Conversion experiment, carried out in Penge. where two houses have been adapted into self-contained, unfurnished. single-room flatlets for Elderly People. An Appeals Sub-Committee was immediately set up. and in March a letter was sent to the North West Kent Housing Society Limited, offering to make a donation of £1.000 0s. Od. if the Society would acquire, convert and run a house in Sidcup where elderly people could live in a single-room flatlet, furnished with their own possessions, and with the knowledge that there was a House Mother in the premises. The North West Kent Housing Society Limited has agreed to adopt this scheme, and is taking active steps to acquire No. 49. Station Road. Sidcup, for this purpose and to negotiate with the Local Authority for a loan. The Committee has now raised rather more than £500 0s. Od. The balance of £500 0s. Od. has to be raised by July 1st." HOSPITAL SERVICES. There are three hospitals in Chislehurst and Sidcup : Queen Mary's Hospital with 350 staffed beds (possible 510) ; Cray Valley Hospital with 35 beds; Sidcup Cottage Hospital with 13 beds, giving a total of 398 beds staffed and available for use. These hospitals form part of the Sidcup and Swanley Hospital Group of the South East London Region. There are ten maternity beds in the Cray Valley Hospital. In addition to these hospitals, six blocks of Grove Park Hospital come within the area of the Urban District. The 296 beds in this section of the hospital are reserved for the use of patients suffering from tuberculosis. This hospital comes within the Lewisham Group of the South East London Region. Venereal Diseases. Patients are referred to the various hospitals with Clinics for dealing with these diseases. COUNTY COUNCIL SERVICES. Home Nursing Service. There are nine Home Nurses employed in the area. Home Nursing is provided on medical certification only and is free. There is no night service at the present time. Health Visiting. Ten Health Visitors, two School Nurses and two Tuberculosis Health Visitors are employed on work within the Urban District. 20 The Health Visitors are responsible for Welfare Centres, Clinics in connection with immunisation against diphtheria and vaccination against smallpox, etc., and carry out home visiting in connection with Child Life Protection, After Care. etc. Midwifery (Domiciliary). Eight Midwives are engaged whole time in the area. The services of the midwives are engaged direct by the patient, or through the patient's private doctor. The midwives act either as midwives or maternity nurses. The County Council is the supervising authority under the National Health Service Act. 1946. Domestic Help Service. Demands for this service are still high, especially for cases of illness in the home and for old people. Provision is also made for domestic help during a home confinement. The following is a summary of the cases in the Chislehurst and Sidcup area who received assistance during 1953 Maternity (expectant mothers) 122 Tuberculosis 43 Aged 236 Others 260 Ambulance Service.

SANITARY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. WATER SUPPLY. At the end of the year, there were two dwelling houses with water supplied from one private well. Samples were taken with the following results :— Satisfied test. Did not satisfy test. Chemical Examination 4 Nil. I am indebted to the Clerk, and the Director of Water Examination of the Metropolitan Water Board, for the following information on the supply of water to the Urban District during the year 1953 :— " No new source of public water supply has been instituted in the Council's area during 1953. There have been no extensions of trunk mains. Various lengths of service mains have been laid within the Urban District. The water supply, generally, has been satisfactory as regards quantity but there has been some reduction of pressure due to heavy consumption during certain periods of peak demand in the vicinity of Chislehurst Common. The supply to the district of Chislehurst and Sidcup has been adequate at all times in 1953 and is derived from the following seven wells : Orpington. North Orpington. Shortlands, Eynsford. Bexley. Wilmington and Darenth, together with Thames-derived filtered water via Shortlands pumping station. Bacteriological analyses of samples of water at these various sources of supply are made at least five times a week and consistently satisfactory results have been obtained from samples of water passing into supply. Chemical analyses of the samples are also made at frequent intervals. 25 All supplies are treated with chlorine on the works, but any excess remaining after a period of contact is removed completely or reduced to an amount that will not be perceptible to consumers. Tanks have been installed at North Orpington, Orpington, Bexley. Shortlands and Wilmington to ensure an adequate period of contact of chlorine with the water ; tanks at other well stations are planned or are in the course of construction. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine before being restored to supply and samples of water from them are analysed to establish that it is up to the normal standard of quality expected in the distribution system. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. We have no information with regard to the proportion of the total number of dwelling houses and population in Chislehurst and Sidcup which are supplied from each of the above-mentioned sources. All the premises are supplied directly and not by means of stand-pipes. Appended are the results of chemical and bacteriological analyses of the various supplies to Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1953 before and after treatment." 26 Average Results of the Chemical and Bacteriological Examination of the Water Supply to Chislehurst and Sidcup during 1953.

The Engineer and Surveyor has kindly furnished details of work carricd out, as under :— A section of 80 yards of open ditch on the District Boundary in the rear of Arlington Close was piped in 12" concrete tubes and 66 yards of existing 9" surface water sewer was relaid in 12" concrete tubes. Forty yards of 18" concrete tubes were laid in Dulverton Road from Frensham Road to the Wyncham stream to relieve flooding in the area. A section of 50 yards of open ditch from Chislehurst High Street to the private allotments north of the Church of the Annunciation was piped in 24" concrete tubes. The outfall of the surface water drainage from the L.C.C. Estate at Mottingham into a ditch in Marvels Wood was reconstructed. One hundred and forty-four yards of 12" concrete surface water sewer was laid across Willow Grove and into the Chislehurst Golf Course to the public sewer to relieve the flooding of properties in Willow Grove. The 6" soil and 9" surface water sewer were relaid for a length of six yards between Chilham Road and Castlecombe Road in Mottingham. These lengths of war damaged sewers caused a local and minor subsidence. Relaying of 185 yards of 12" concrete surface water sewer between Priestlands Park to Longlands Road to relieve flooding, now in hand, will be completed before 31st March. 1954. Laying of 85 yards of 12" surface water sewer in Cray Road to improve drainage now in hand and will be completed before 31st March, 1954. The following lengths of new sewers were adopted under Section 17 of the Public Health Act. 1936. on the L.C.C. Estate. St. Paul's Cray Soil Sewer. 513 yards, 9" diameter. Surface Water Sewers. 283 yards of 24" diameter. 86 yards of 18" diameter. 251 yards of 15" diameter. 153 yards of 12" diameter. 410 yards of 9" diameter. 317 yards of 7" diameter. CESSPOOLS. One new building with cesspool drainage was erected during 1953. 29 As far as is known. 472 premises are not drained to sewers. They are as under :— Lamorbey and Blackfen 11 Sidcup and Footscray 22 North Cray 238 St. Paul's Cray 99 Chislehurst and Mottinnham 102 Up to the end of the year, owners or occupiers ot premises made private arrangements with a Gravesend firm for emptying cesspools. The charge is 23/- for the first 1.000 gallons and 20/for each subsequent 1.000 gallons removed. Active consideration and development of plans for extension of sewers will, it is anticipated, operate in the coming year. At the time of writing this report, the Council have agreed a service for cesspool emptying. RIVERS AND STREAMS. No works have been carried out during 1953. Six inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors. SWIMMING BATHS. There is one small private open air swimming pool in the area to which the public are admitted in the summer. Six samples of water were taken during 1953. the first four being unsatisfactory and the last two satisfactory. Two samples of water from a private swimming pool at a factory were also taken and found to be satisfactory. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948. A total of 268 inspections and re-inspections were made during the year and 36 nuisances and defects were found. Thirty-five nuisances and defects were remedied during the year. The following is a copy of the return for the Year 1953, which has been supplied to the Minister of Labour and National Service :— 1. Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health.

Sixteen inspections and observations were made of premises in the district. Emission of " Cement Dust." Many complaints were received during the early part of the year on the whitish grey dust deposits in the district. It is likely that this was dust from cement works. Together with neighbouring Authorities, the matter was taken up with the manufacturers of cement. The Deputy Chief Inspector of Alkali, etc.. Works. Ministry of Housing and Local Government, was consulted. Representatives of the Council later attended meetings of the Thames-side Advisory Committee of Atmospheric Pollution. On 1st August. 1953. a deposit gauge for the measurement of deposited matter was installed on the roof of Footscray County Primary School. Riverside Road. Sidcup. The readings from this Gauge are given below :— Monthly Deposit. Tons per sq. mile. Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec.

Allen is the Inspector appointed under the above Acts. Fifty-six licences were issued to store Petroleum Spirits and Petroleum Mixtures. The total storage capacity licensed during the year was:— Bulk storage—98,195 gallons in underground tanks. Can storage—10 gallons. Petroleum mixtures in special stores—4,605 gallons. VERMINOUS CONDITIONS AND UNCLEANLINESS. During the year. 17 complaints were received of infestation of premises by bed bugs. This shows a continued low number of complaints and it appears that bed bug infestation is well under control. The number of houses and/or their contents found to be infested was nine (including six in the Council's possession). In suitable cases, and on the request of tenant or owner, the disinfestation of the premises and contents were simultaneously carried out by the Department. In other cases, the premises were disinfested by the owners, and the contents by the tenants. In all necessary cases, bedding was steam disinfected by the Department. The usual method of disinfestation is to spray with D.D.T. Fluid. Close supervision was made of premises which had been disinfested, and the tenants were given suitable advice and instruction on methods of prevention and destruction of vermin. RODENT CONTROL.

Ruxley site (reference (i) above) occupied to capacity by 36 families, nearly all of which have licences for their dwellings issued by the Council. This enables some control to be exercised. Most of the occupants go away for fruit picking during the summer months, some of whom, however, leave their vans on the site. The adjoining site (No. (ii)) is a new extension. The Old Brickfield. Baugh Estate, Footscray (site No. (iii)). is owned by the Council and all the caravans are licensed. Corke's Meadow, St. Paul's Cray (No. (xiv)), now entirely surrounded by houses and in a built up area, remains a major problem. Consultations have taken place during the year with the Minister of Housing and Local Government. London County Council, the prospective owners of the site. Kent County Council, or the Planning Authority with a view to the removal of the families from the site. It is hoped to re-site some, if not all, of the families on another site in the district.

There are 28 piggeries in the district, to which 87 visits were made. Eighteen defects were found and remedied. SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. 48 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. Three hundred and one visits were made to notified cases of infectious disease, etc. On the removal of a case to Hospital, release from quarantine (home cases) or in other necessary cases, disinfection was immediately carried out by spraying rooms and their contents with formalin, the clothing and bedding being steam disinfected at the disinfecting station. Public library books found in any premises in which infectious or contagious disease occurred were also disinfected by formalin vapour in a special metal chamber. The disinfections carried out during the year were as follow Fumigation. Sprayed Steam Disinfected.

Fourteen (confirmed) notifications of this disease were received during the year. Ten of these cases were removed to hospital. Seven were paralytic and seven non-paralytic. There was one death from this disease in Chislehurst and Sidcup area. Months during which the cases were notified :— January — July 2 February 1 August 3 March — September 1 April — October 3 May 3 November — June 1 December — Scarlet Fever. One hundred and forty-three cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, giving an attack rate of 1.7 per 1.000 population. Fifty of these cases were removed to hospital and the remainder home nursed. This disease continued to be mild in character and the distribution of the cases was fairly even throughout the area. There were two " return " cases. No deaths from this disease were recorded in the district. Diphtheria. No cases occurred in the Urban District during 1953. Diphtheria Immunisation. The following figures, which have been supplied by the County Medical Officer, show that, during the year 1953, a total of 1.142 children received Primary Inoculations, and 1,254 Reinforcing Inoculations. (Figures for 1952 were 1,461 Primary and 1.328 Reinforcing Inoculations.) A total of 13.412 children under the age of fifteen years on 31st December. 1953. had completed a course of immunisation (at any time since 1st January. 1939). out of a total of 21.155— i.e., 63%. 50 Year of Birth Last complete course of injections (whether primary or booster) 1949=1953 1948 or earlier Population 1951 Census 1939 447 259 1,160 1940 213 303 1,259 1941 223 293 1,198 1942 334 598 1,292 1943 430 456 1,105 1944 835 224 1,150 1945 625 180 1,321 1946 880 164 1,398 1947 1,198 132 1,520 1948 1,183 91 1,494 1949 940 — 1,964 1950 1,175 — 1,837 1951 1,162 — 1,615 1952 918 — 1,551 1953 149 — 1,291 Total 10,712 2,700 21,155 Typhoid Fever. No cases were notified. Puerperal Pyrexia. There were sixteen cases notified, of which ten were institutionally treated. This represents an attack rate of 12.1 per 1.000 total births. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Three cases were notified, all of which made a satisfactory recovery and there was no impairment of vision in any case. Pemphigus Neonatorum. No cases were notified. Measles. One thousand and ninety-seven notifications were received during 1953, as against one thousand, three hundred and fifteen for 1952. giving an attack rate of 12.9 per 1.000 total population. Four of these cases were admitted to hospital and the remainder home nursed. There were no deaths from this disease recorded in the Urban District. 51 Whooping Cough. Four hundred and forty-eight notifications of this disease were received during 1953, as against five hundred and thirty in 1952. This figure represents an attack rate of 5.3 per 1.000 total population. Eight of these cases were removed to hospital and the remainder home nursed. There were no deaths recorded from this disease in the area. Tuberculosis.

A survey was carried out on the St. Paul's Cray Estate from the 8th to 17th June, 1953. when a total of 3.685 attended the Unit. Of this number, nine were significant new cases, or 2.4 per 1.000. compared with 4 per 1.000 at the 1952 survey held in Chislehurst and Sidcup, when 3,545 persons attended. It would appear from our records that cases of Tuberculosis are now being notified very much earlier in the disease, which in itself gives more chance of treatment being successful. The progressive fall in the death rate year by year is common throughout the country. Food Poisoning. There were no confirmed cases of Food Poisoning in the area during 1953. Other Infectious Diseases. In addition to the infectious diseases enumerated above, notifications were received as under :— Dysentery 36 Erysipelas 15 Pneumonia (all forms) 83 APPENDIX.
