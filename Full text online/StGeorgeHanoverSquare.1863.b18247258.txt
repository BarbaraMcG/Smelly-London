HAN 13 No. XXII.] QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH OF Saint George Sanober Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 28th, 1863. WITH THE ANNUAL SUMMARY. London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W, to the Vestry of St. George, Sanober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, We have the honour to lay before you a table, showing the causes of death, the ages of the deceased, and the sub-districts in which the deaths occurred, within this parish, for the thirteen weeks ended March 28th, 1863. The total number of deaths is 553, in which are included those of 68 non-parishioners, who died in St. George's Hospital, and of 6 of the inmates of the Little Chelsea Workhouse. This number is much below that of the corresponding quarter of last year, when it was 609 ; but is nearly that of 1861, when it was 540, and of 1860, when it was 547. The mortality in the Belgrave sub-district especially has been lower than it was last year; and although the weekly average for the whole parish, 42.5, is nominally higher than that of the preceding ten years, which is only 37.8; yet we must bear in mind the yearly increase of 1,500, at the least, which accrues to our population; and may congratulate ourselves on the fact that the last year has shown a great saving of life, as we shall prove in detail presently. 4 We give as usual a few remarks on those deaths which are commonly considered to be in some measure preventable by greater cleanliness, knowledge, and care. First come the zymotic, or epidemic and infectious diseases, the deaths from which were 137, or nearly onefourth of the whole. There were 12 from small-pox, of which we shall speak presently; then the large amount of 37 from measles, 35 of which occurred in the Belgrave sub-district, and all of children under five. During January no fewer than 23 deaths were due to this cause, including those of 3 children in one house in Pulfordstreet. Scarlatina destroyed 14 lives, and diphtheria 5. Two of the deaths from scarlatina occurred at No. 11, Lancashire-court; two in Wilton-terrace; 3 in nonparishioners in St. George's Hospital, 1 in Pulford-street, in the house where 3 children died of measles. Single deaths occurred in Little Grosvenor-street, Thomas-street, Moreton-place, Park-side, Rutland-terrace, and Westmoreland-street. The deaths from diphtheria occurred in Derby-street, Eaton-place, Grosvenor-gate, and Upper Belgrave-street; besides one case of measles which was complicated with diphtheria. There was one death from ulcerated sore throat in Davies-mews, at a dirty and ill-ventilated stable, now pulled down, and one in Charlwood-street. The large number of 28 children died of whooping cough, 27 of whom belonged to the lower parts of the Belgrave sub-district. The deaths from the various kinds of continued fever were 16, three of which were deaths of non-parishioners. It is the peculiarity of these fevers, that though they do not altogether spare children, they attack adults by preference. 5 The number of deaths from various kinds of degeneration and ill-development was, 128, including those of children who were born prematurely, 14; or who were too feeble to live, 7; or who died of teethiDg, 10; or malformations, 4; fits, 20; water in the head, 6 ; scrofula, 4; and tabes mesenterica, 11; and of all who died of consumption, 52. The deaths from lung disease were 98; they fluctuate according to the weather from about 20 to 150 per quarter. The deaths in childbirth are 8, being twice the usual number, and demand a notice, but do not appear to have been due to any preventable influence. Two were attributed to haemorrhage, one to puerperal fever, two to inflammation, one to consumption, and one was that of an unfortunate unmarried French girl, who fainted off and died of grief, when she found that she had given birth to twins. Amongst the deaths worthy of note, we find one of a lady aged 28, who died of a choleraic attack, attributed to the chloroform used in removing a tumour from the breast; two deaths after operations for removing ovarian tumours; one after an operation on a parotid tumour, and one of a man of 50, an interpreter from Brompton, of starvation. The last set of deaths on which we shall offer any remarks, are those arising from accident as it is called, or from crime. Among these, are the cases of infanticide, real or supposed. There was a male child about 6 weeks oid, found drowned in the Serpentine;—a female infant newly born, with a tape round its neck;—another newly born female infant, found in Hyde Park, which seemed to have been suffocated. These were doubt less murders. On the other hand such entries as the two following 6 point to children who died a natural death and then were thrown away like dead dogs to avoid the trouble and expense of burial. "Male newly born" found in Hyde Park; and after a post mortem and inquest, death attributed to pressure on the head during severe labour. "Male newly born" found on the area steps of a house in George-street, Hanover-square, which had also died a natural death from pressure during labour. Whilst there are yet two others showing the results of carelessness—a child of 3 months suffocated in bed with its nurse, at 8, Mount-row, another of 5 months, at 11, Robert's-buildings. Deaths by burns and scalds also exhibit the natural consequences of carelessness. A girl one year old pulled a cup of tea over her; another had her bed-gown set on fire by a candle; a girl of nine set her clothes on fire by reaching something from a chimney-piece; a young woman of 22 and a girl of 9 set their skirts on fire at a grate; a girl of 2 is burned nobody knows how. Amongst the remaining accidental deaths, we may notice one due to a fall from a window-cleaning machine, which was not strong enough for its purpose, and one to a fall from a parapet, whilst cleaning windows. Two persons were knocked down and killed by vans, one by a cab, and one by the starting of a horse he was holding;—a young woman, a non-parishioner, brought to St. George's Hospital, who had been thrown from a cart, because the horse stepped into a hole in the road near Putney;—and an old pensioner found insensible, with ribs broken, and a wound in the head, doubtless because thrown down by some vehicle. The deaths of two parishioners and one stranger occurred, from falling down stairs. One boy was drowned by falling from a barge, and another by fallingfrom 7 some logs on which he was playing in the Thames; and a constable died by falling from a wall in Hyde-park. There were two supposed suicides, one of an ale house keeper who hanged himself in Hyde-park; one of a comedian who cut his throat; besides a solicitor's clerk who was found drowned in the Thames, with no evidence how. the sickness. In the Hanover and May-fair sub-districts, the number of cases treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and by the Medical Officers of the Dispensary, Mount-street, and in the sick wards attached to the Workhouse, was 1,060 exclusive of the 23 cases of small pox sent in from Belgravia. These 1,060 cases comprised 12 of small pox, 2 of chicken pox, and 8 of measles. But these figures by no means represent the prevalence of the last two diseases, which if mild, are generally left without medical attendance. There were 6 cases of scarlatina, 2 of diphtheria, 4 of whooping cough, 1 of croup, 17 of diarrhoea, 2 of dysentery, 17 of fever of various kinds, 2 of erysipelas, 218 of bronchitis and catarrh, 2 of pleurisy, and 3 of pneumonia. The chief places to which our attention has been directed in consequence of illness, have been as follows : No. 11, Lancashire Court.—Diarrhœa, scarlet fever, sore throat. No. 4, Thomas Street.—Scarlet fever. A girl of 13 was sent from this house to the fever hospital, on 29th January; she returned and died at home, and was kept unburied a long time. No. 19, Brick Street.—Diarrhœa. No. 8, Queen Street.—Croup, 8 No. 9, Robert Street.—Diphtheria, and 3 cases of sore throat. Besides, the houses in which small pox, or any other epidemic disease has occurred, have been visited, and cleaning and purification recommended and enforced, so far as our powers extend. In the Belgrave sub-district 8,317 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 4,402 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,915. The total figures include 81 of small pox, 29 of chicken pox, 161 of measles, 14 of scarlet fever, 47 of whooping cough, 4 of cough, 112 of diarrhoea, 5 of dysentery, 60 of continued fever, 40 of rheumatic fever, 28 of erysipelas, 6 of diphtheria, and 3 of carbuncle. There were 560 cases of bronchitis, 17 of pleurisy, and 46 of pneumonia. the small pox. The Summary for the preceding quarter describes the introduction of small pox into the Belgrave sub-district, by a boy who was admitted into St George's Hospital, on October 24th. It shows also that four patients in the Hospital were infected and sent to the Small Pox Hospital, that there were 6 other cases amongst the public patients in the Belgrave sub-district, and 1 death; and that so far as the In-Wards are concerned, the disease appeared in a house in Park Lane, in November, and was brought to No. 10, Robert-street on 17th December by a woman from Mile End. 9 From that time to the 28th March, the number of cases which occurred in the public charitable practice, amongst the 13,000 poor, the servants, &c., in the In-wards, was 12. Three cases occurred at No. 10, Robert-street, and amongst them was the only death, that of an infant of 10 months, recently brought into the district, and unvaccinated. Three cases were sent to the Small Pox Hospital; one of whom was first sent to the Fever Hospital, and transferred to the Small Pox Hospital when the eruption appeared; four were removed to the Sick Wards Mount-street, and five were treated at home. Out of the cases in which the particulars could be learned, seven had been vaccinated ; one had even been recently re-vaccinated. Three had not been vaccinated; one of whom was the infant that died : a second was a girl who had been received into the Curzon Schools upon the false statement by her mother that she had been vaccinated; and the third a boy of 7 was asserted to have had small pox before. Besides these 12 cases, the disease is known to have attacked a young man set. 21, well vaccinated, at 32, Thomas-street, and a man-servant in Portugal Street, who was sent by his master to the Small Pox Hospital, and died there. Two cases were said to have happened in Bruton-place, and two in Mount-street, of which no particulars are known. But including these, the total number known in the In-wards during 13 weeks was 18; or if we reckon from the beginning of the epidemic, in December, 20. In the Belgrave sub-district, Dr. Aldis reported 81 cases of small pox to the Sanitary Committee. They occurred in the following localities:—Hindon-street, Pulford-street, Union-street, Sutherland-terrace, Upper Ebury Street, Susannah-place, Grillingham-street, Eccles- 10 ton-place, Allington-street, South-place, Eliza-place, St. George's-road, New Grosvenor-place, Grosvenor-cottages, Skinner-place, Eaton-cottages, Hatt's Yard, Brewer-street, Spring-gardens, Robert's-buildings, Windsor-terrace, Flask-lane, Wilton-road, Stanley-place, Wilton-place, Tachbrook-street, St. George's-mews, New-street, Averyfarm-row, Wilton-terrace, Pulford-terrace, Pembrokeplace, New-street-cottages, St. George's-terrace, Ranelagh-road, and Hugh-street. Of these 81 patients, 7 were sent to the Small Pox Hospital (four from one house in Pulford-street) of whom one died. Twenty-three were sent to the Sick Wards at Mountstreet, of whom four died. Three of these were not vaccinated; the fourth displayed three remarkably fine vaccine cicatrices on each arm. No death from small pox occurred in the Belgrave sub-district, till March 9th ; between which and the 28th occurred the 7 deaths mentioned in the annexed table of mortality. One of an unvaccinated child of one month, another of a child of ten weeks, another of a child 14 days old; and four of adults, two vaccinated, and two unvaccinated. 11 APPENDIX. No. I. water.

No. III. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the "Works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper. The following Table gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable.

Births. The number in the whole parish was 2411. In the years ending March 31st 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 The numbers were 2165 2288 2300 2119 2498 In the Hanover and May-fair sub-districts, the births were 661, in the years 1858 1859 1860 1861 1862 the numbers were 660 705 710 656 735 In the Belgrave subdistrict this year there were 1750 . 1505 1583 1590 1463 1763 Deaths. The gross number in the whole parish has been 1882; whereas in the foregoing 5 years they were 1768 1838 1837 1769 1965 Gross Death-rate. Estimating the population of the whole parish as 90,000 at the end of 1862, the gross death-rate was 20.9 per 1000 living, last year it was 22.2, with an estimated population of 88,500 17 1858 1860 1860 1861 1862 Excess of Births over Deaths, 529 in the whole parish 397 450 463 350 533 Estimated Population. This we believe to have been 90,000 at the end of 1862. The Hanover and May-Fair sub-districts are virtually stationary; but the Belgrave increases at the rate of at least 1500 per annum. It increased 15,000 in the ten years 1851-61, and the number of premises rated to the relief of the poor continues to increase at an uniform rate. They were 6458 in 1860, 6659 in 1861, 6802 in 1862, and 6956 in 1863. The assumed increase of inhabitants in Belgravia is, we think, thus warranted. Deaths in St. George's Hospital for the year ended 1858 1859 1860 1861 1863 28th March, 1863, 317 . 311 314 316 330 308 Non-parishioners who died there, 253 255 251 243 263 443 Parishioners who died there, 64 56 63 73 67 65 From the Hanover and MayFair sub-districts, 19 — — 24 27 22 From the Belgrave, 45 — — 49 40 43 Deaths in Mount-street Workhouse, 100 88 75 72 96 69 Deaths in Little Chelsea Workhouse, 26 41 33 28 25 27 If the 64 deaths of parishioners in St. George's Hospital and the 126 in the Workhouses = 190, be compared with the total mortality, 1882, it will be seen that nearly one out of every ten of our parishioners who died in the parish, died in a bed provided by public or private charity. In the Hanover and May-Fair sub-districts the gross 18 mortality in the year ended 28th March, 1863, has been 577, including the deaths of 100 in the workhouse, the bodies of 1 child and 1 adult found in the streets, 3 children and 5 adults in the Serpentine, and 3 children and 3 adults in Hyde-park. The numbers for the preceding six years in succession are, 560, 605, 543, 567, 534, and 570. This gives a gross death-rate of 17.7 per 1000 for the year, estimating the population as stationary at 32,500. Thus during the last six years the mortality in this part of the parish has fluctuated between 16, 17, and 18 per 1000 per annum. We now proceed, as in former reports, to divide the Hanover and May-Fair sub-districts into 2 classes of streets. First, the aristocratic and first-class business streets and squares—such as Albemarle and Arlington streets, North and South Audley streets, Grosvenor and Berkeley squares, &c. We obtained an exact record of the population of these streets at the census of 1851, and we believe there has been no material fluctuation since: the population of these streets was then 20,000. The deaths in them last year were 201, or at the rate of 10 per 1000 of the population. The deaths for the foregoing six years have been 216, 209, 192, 201, 187, 187. Out of the 201 deaths, 41, or one-fifth, were of children under 5. Now if we take the remaining streets, that is the 2nd and 3rd class business streets, the mews, and the streets occupied by the artizan and servant classes. The population of these is 12,500, say 13,000. The total number of persons who died at home in these streets last year, excluding all that died in the workhouse or in the hospital, and all that were found in the park or streets, is 258, of whom 121 were children under 5, or nearly onehalf. The rate of persons who died at home is 19.8 per 1000. 19 The gross number of deaths in the Belgrave sub-district is 1279. If we estimate the population at the close of the year 1862 as 58.000, the gross rate of mortality was 22 per 1000 living. If we exclude the 317 deaths in St. George's Hospital, and take non-account of those which occurred in the workhouse, the deaths at home were 962, or at the rate of 16.6 per 1000 living. The deaths under 5, in the Belgrave sub-district, were 489, or nearly half of the total deaths at home. Last year the deaths under 5 in this sub-district were 580. So that this year there has been a saving of nearly 100 children's lives. We have not the exact record of the population in the streets of the Belgrave sub-district as we have of the Hanover and May-Fair; but just as we have shown the contrast between the rich streets and poor streets in the one, so we can in the other district. For an example, in 5 squares inhabited by the rich and 7 streets inhabited by the poor, the deaths under and over 5 during the last year were as follows:— MORTALITY IN FIVE SQUARES. 1862. 1863.

CAUSES OF DEATH. In the year ending March,— 1860. 1861. 1862. 1863. The deaths from zymotic disease 346 291 448 395 „ small-pox 6 8 1 13 „ scarlatina, diphtheria, and other forms of fever with throat disease 82 53 82 117 The deaths from typhus fever 44 39 63 68 „ diarrhœa, dysentery, and cholera 48 83 53 41 ,, teething, convulsions, consumption, water in the head, mesenteric disease and scrofula 395 353 387 342 21 the sickness. The total number of cases treated during the year, by the Parochial Medical Officers, and at the Dispensary, Mount-street, and in the Sick-Wards of the Mount-street Workhouse, has been 3,901. Amongst whom were 13 cases of small-pox; 3 of chicken pox; 61 of measles; 25 of scarlatina; 13 of diphtheria; 37 of whooping cough; 232 of diarrhoea; 4 of dysentery; one of cholera; 72 of fever; 8 of erysipelas; 620 of bronchitis and catarrh; pleurisy 4; pneumonia 7. In the Belgrave sub-district 29,343 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas Dispensary, and the Workhouse, Little Chelsea; of these 17,227 were patients at St. George's Hospital. The whole number includes 87 cases of smallpox, 85 of chicken pox, 319 of measles, 181 of scarlet fever, 116 of whooping cough, 15 of croup, 773 of diarrhoea, 14 of dysentery, 215 of continued fever, 184 of rheumatic fever, 83 of erysipelas, 17 of diphtheria, 6 of carbuncle, and 11 of ague, 6 of which occurred in nonparishioners at St. George's Hospital. There were also 1,745 cases of bronchitis, 53 of pleurisy, and 141 of pneumonia. Vaccination during this year.—Mr. Jay performed 28 1 vaccinations, of which 251 were successful. Mr. Jorden 898, including 133 re-vaccinations, of which all but 22 were successful. We have visited, and from time to time inspected the children in the various national and other schools; and here we find it necessary to repeat the remarks made last year. 22 The rule that no child shall be admitted who has not been vaccinated, is virtually evaded in about three per cent. at least of the children; whether from the ignorance, or carelessness, or deceit of the parents. The only means of ensuring the observance of this rule, is personal examination by the master or mistress, or by a medical practitioner. The state of personal uncleanness and disease of the skins of some children is a matter which deserves the attention of the School Committees; but we are most glad to say that the practice of resorting to the Public Baths is on the increase amongst children of the better and more orderly class, and that it is most judiciously fostered by the wise liberality of the Commissioners of the Baths and Washhouses. Work of the Sanitary Committee.—The number of complaints brought before this Committee, and entered in Mr. Grant's book, is 815; the notices served 159, summonses 6; slaughterhouses licensed 34, cowhouses 20; marine store dealers regularly inspected 40. Our thanks are due to Mr. Jay and Mr Jorden the registrars and vaccinators; to Mr. Hughes, registrar; to Drs. Bloxam, W. Bloxam and Symes, Messrs. W. Griffith, E. Davis, F. Godrich, sen., and W. Pain, of the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, and to Mr. Connock of the Mountstreet Dispensary, for much valuable information and many facilities in the discharge of our duties. C. J. B. Aldis, M.D. R.

No. XXIII.] QUARTERLY SUMMARY OF THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IS THE PARISH OF Saint George, Hanober Square, AND OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 27th, 1863. London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, upper ranelagh street, pimlico, s.w. TO THE Vestry of St. George, Honober Squar. My Lords and Gentlemen, The number of deaths registered during the thirteen weeks ended June 27th, 1863, was 550, including those of 60 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital, and of 12 inmates at Little Chelsea Workhouse. This is a greater number than was registered in the corresponding quarters of the foregoing five years, viz.:— Zymotic diseases. 1858 2nd quarter 479 89 1859 421 81 1860 450 81 1861 411 84 1862 453 79 The excess for the present quarter is found among the deaths from zymotic diseases, which amounted to 134; whereas in the corresponding quarter of last year they were only 79. Hence the weekly average of deaths for this quarter, 42, exceeds that of the corresponding weeks of ten years, which is 32. Amongst the deaths were 25 of parishioners from smallpox, 1 of which occurred in the Hanover, 2 in the Mayfair, 4 10 in Mount-street workhouse, and 12 in the Belgrave subdistrict. There were no deaths from small-pox in the Midsummer quarter of 1862, and only 5 from measles; while in the present quarter there are 25 from the former and 15 from the latter disease. One child died from measles at Barlow-mews, in the Mayfair district, 1 non-parishioner at St. George's Hospital, and 13 in the annexed streets in Belgravia; viz., Belgrave-mews-south, Chester-terrace Eaton-square, Union-street, Robert-street, Avery-farm-row, West-street, Gloucester-street, Sutherlandterrace, Berwick-street, Westbourne-street and Hugh-street West. Nine persons died from scarlet fever; 3 from diphtheria, in Stanley-street and Grosvenor-row; 6 from croup; 34 from whooping-cough; and 22 from typhus fever, in Charles-street, Shepherd's-court, Denbigh-street, Clough'scottages, Robert's-buildings, New Grosvenor-place, Moretonterrace, St. George's-place Knightsbridge, Bloomfield-terrace, Caroline-street, and Sutherland-terrace. Deaths from consumption, scrofula, convulsions, teething, and other diseases of degeneration and ill-development, destroyed 137 patients, including from premature birth, 11; from atrophy and debility, 15; from malformations, 1; water in the head, 8; scrofula, 1; tabes mesenterica, 6; convulsions, 33; and from consumption, 62. Lung diseases proved fatal to 68 persons. Among the accidental deaths we notice 4 from burns and scalds, one of which occurred in a parishioner aged 48, at St. George's Hospital, whose clothes caught fire from a candle. A boy and girl, both aged 1 year, were scalded to death by hot water from cups pulled over by themselves at Cambridge-terrace and Commercial-road South. A nonparishioner also died. 5 A boy aged 13 fell from a log of wood into the water when at play at the Water Works Docks, Pimlico, and a newly-born infant was found suffocated while in bed with its parent at the "Workhouse, Mount-street. We record one case of murder of a woman by her husband, who beat her on her head with a bar of iron. She was a non-parishioner, and died iu St. George's Hospital. Three cases of suicide were registered, namely, — one of a man in South Molton-street, who shot himself in the head with a brace of pistols; another of a woman aged 65, who hanged herself to the iron rod of a skylight; and the third of a man aged 27, who was found in the Serpentine. Among the deaths from causes not specified or ill-defined, were those of two infants found in Hyde-park, of one in the enclosure of Eaton-square, another in the enclosure of Belgrave-square, and a fifth at the Pimlico Pier, Thames Bank. One of the infants in Hyde-park was clearly recognized by the jury as having been still-born and cast out,—not murdered. A boy of 4 years and 9 months died on the 9th June, in Chapel-mews, Robert-street, of "Choleraic diarrhoea." This led to an inspection of the dwelling, a report on which was laid before the Sanitary Committee. It consisted of a few utterly unventilated rooms and water-closet over a farrier's shop, and in consequence of the action of the Committee is now disused as a dwelling. On the 9th June, an illegitimate female child, aged six months, died in Clarges-street, of ulcerated prolapsus ani; a most unusual cause of death. 6 the sickness in the hanover and mayfair sub-districts. During these three months the number of patients treated by the Parochial Medical Officers, and at the Dispensary, and in the sick-wards of the Workhouse, Mount-street, was 1,178. Amongst them were 94 cases of small-pox, viz.,—34 of inhabitants of the Hanover and Mayfair sub-districts, 6 of inmates of the Workhouse, and 54 admitted from the Belgrave sub-district. Chicken-pox numbered 16 cases, measles 11, scarlet fever 13, whooping-cough 32, diarrhoea 14, continued fever 28, erysipelas 3, bronchitis 159, and diphtheria 4. sickness in the belgrave sub-district. In the Belgrave Sub-District 8,514 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 4816 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3698. The total figures include 105 of small-pox, 31 of chicken-pox, 49 of measles, 21 of scarlet-fever, 78 of whooping-cough, 1 of croup, 142 of diarrhoea, 7 of dysentery, 55 of continued fever, 39 of rhcumatic fever, 17 of erysipelas, 2 of diphtheria, 1 of ague, and 3 of carbuncle. There were 432 cases of bronchitis, 14 of pleurisy, and 45 of pneumonia. 7 small-pox. In the Report for the preceding quarter it is said that two cases of small-pox occurred in the Hanover and Mayfair subdistricts in December 1862, and 18 during the first quarter of 1863, of which 18 twelve were parish patients. Between the 29th March and 27th June, the total number of cases reported to have occurred is 45. 32 of these were received into the wards in Mount-street, and 2 were treated at home by the parochial medical officers. The remaining 11 were persons who employed their own private medical attendant, and we have only hearsay evidence respecting most of them.* There may have been more cases, for it was curious to notice the efforts made, and often successfully made, to keep the disease a secret. For instance, one of the deaths registered, from confluent small-pox, occurred on premises, the proprietor of which, though living on the spot, said he knew nothing about it till two months afterwards. And a tradesman's wife in Union-street, Bond-street, says, she never knew that there were four persons in her house ill with small-pox, till she was taken ill with it herself, and made a fifth. Out of these 45 cases, 10 were children under 15, of whom it was ascertained that 7 were vaccinated. Out of the 35 adults received into Mount-street, 7 were strangers. For example— * In making this enumeration, a man who was admitted twice to the Mount-street wards is only counted once. A woman admitted with measles is not reckoned at all, and a man who had been sent to the Small-pox Hospital during the previous quarter, and was admitted into Mount-street this quarter, is not reckoned as a fresh patient. 8 May 16. Thos. H., set. 18, shoemaker, working at 72, Davies-street, but living at Hooper's-court, Knightsbridge. May 18. Mary H., set. 26, taken ill at Queen-street, Knightsbridge, where she was living as a servant; sent in a cab to 17, Brown-street, where her mother lives; never vaccinated till May 11th, the day she became ill. May 12. John L., 23, coachman, lodging in South-street; vaccinated. May 11. W. H., 24, lodging in Davies-street; vaccinated. June 4. W. H., 25, from Chipping Norton; only a few days in London; lodging at the " Greyhound," Brick-street. June 5. G. B., 29, a marine from Chatham, "drinking about at various public houses;" vaccinated. June 15. W. B., set. 17, native of Meopham; lodging in Woodstock-street, vaccinated. The remaining adult patients, were either domestic servants, artizans in lodgings, or small housekeepers. Amongst them were 4 unvaccinated, viz.— Elizabeth W., set. 23, No. —, Clarges-street, recently confined in Mount-street of an illegitimate child. Robert P. set. 18, 4, Street's-buiklings. Caroline G., 33, servant at No. —, Norfolk-street. "VV. B., 20, shopman at a grocer's in Oxford-street. The fatal cases were three, viz.,—one in the Hanover sub-district, thus entered in the Register of Deaths:— "20th April, 2, Ilanover-place, Bond-street,/., 3 weeks, daughter of a domestic servant, small-pox. Eruption stated to have been out when brought from the hospital a week ago. No medical attendant." This case led of course to inquiry. The mother of this infant was a woman aged 46, wife of a gentleman's servant in the country, ill with consumption, and a patient in the Charing Cross Hospital, where she was delivered on the 30th 9 March. The child was soon afterwards noticed to be ill, and in consequence, the hospital authorities sent to its grandmother, who lived at 2, Hanover-place, who, at their request or suggestion, removed the child from the hospital in a street cab on Monday the 13th April. The hospital people say that they did not know that the child had small-pox when it was sent out, but that it must have gone out somewhere even if they had known it. An attempt has been made to deny that the disease was small-pox, because the fact was not certified by any medical attendant; but a respectable married woman at No. 2, Hanover-place, to whom the infant was brought to be suckled on the day that it came from the hospital, saw the spots, and the undertaker says there can be no doubt of it. The body was taken to the cemetery on the box of another street cab to be buried. Two in the Mayfair sub-district, registered thus, viz.:— "25th April, 1863. No.—, Piccadilly,/., 30. Epilepsy, with consequent imbecility, 10 years; confluent smallpox 10 days; certified." She had been vaccinated young. " 15th May, 1863. No. 4, John's-court, m., 1 year. Scarlatina 6 days, small-pox 4 days; certified." This latter was a very unfortunate case. On inspecting the children of the Grosvenor School, we found an unvaccinated child, Joseph W., aged 3, living at 4, John's-court. The parents were extremely unwilling to have the operation done, and only yielded to the strongest pressure and threats of legal proceedings. After Joseph W., his younger brother Arthur W., aged 1 year, was done on the 4th May, and was seized in succession with scarlatina and small-pox, and died on the 15th. It is fair to add that both children were so feeble and ricketty, that the delay of their vaccination was excusable. Six inmates of the workhouse contracted the disease, viz.:— 10 April 29th, Fanny C., set. 25, came in to be confined, from 23, Caroline-street, Pimlico, had a very slight attack of small-pox a month afterwards; vaccinated; three very slight marks. Infant of the foregoing; vaccinated, but the operation did not take. Mary Ann H., aged 58, nurse, one good vaccine mark; small-pox slight. June 2, Edward H., 16, vaccinated at Little Chelsea; marks doubtful. June 5, Thomas F., 29, vaccinated. June 17, infant of Maria II., born in workhouse 30th May; attacked with small-pox 14th June, died 23rd (but its death not included, as it was not registered till after the end of the quarter). The deaths registered in Mount-street workhouse were 10; 8 of persons who came from the Belgrave sub-district, one from the Hanover, and one infant born in the house. April 13. Boy, 5 months, from No. 14, Eaton-court; came with its mother in the workhouse with small-pox: vaccinated. April 16. Wife of a labourer, set. 40; 3, Bridge-row: good vaccine scars on both arms. April 20. Coachman, aged 40; 25, Belgrave-mews: vaccination doubtful. April 22. Coachman, aged 22; 4, Upper Ranelaghstreet: not vaccinated. April 24. Boy, aged 6, son of a labourer, discharged soldier; 11, St. George's-row: not vaccinated till small-pox appeared. April 26. Boy, aged 6 weeks; ditto, ditto, ditto. May 5. Boy, aged 2 months, born in the workhouse; mother came from 23, Caroline-street, Pimlico: vaccination did not take. 11 May 11. Girl, aged 4, daughter of a labourer, from 11, St. George's-row. May 20. Porter, aged 23; from No. 9, Hart-street. June 3. Boy, aged 3; from 31, Queen-street, Pimlico. From the Belgrave sub-district 54 persons were received into the wards at Mount-street, 8 of whom died, as above. (One patient from the Hanover and one from the Belgrave died on the 21st June, but their deaths were not registered till the next quarter.) Of these 54, 18 were children. Three who died were the children of a soldier, living at 11, St. George's-row, born in India, and never vaccinated till the small-pox had seized them. One was an infant which came with its father and mother from 14, Eaton-court. 7 others were not vaccinated, and 5 were so. Of the 36 adults, 1 had been inoculated for small-pox when a child; 6 were not vaccinated; 16 were so. The twelve deaths from small-pox, which happened in the patients' own houses, in the Belgrave sub-district, were distributed as follows:— April 7. No. 8 Charlwood-place f. æt. 3 vaccinated „ 8. „ 12 Spring-gardens . f. „ 39 „ „ 9. „ 2 Brewer-street . m. „ 1 unvaccinated „ 10. „ 4 Hindon-place . m. „ 6 wks. „ „ 14. „ 7 St. George's-pl.. f. „ 38 „ „ 20. „ 2 Ditto . . f. „ 14 vaccinated „ 30. „ 2 Ditto . . m. „ 2 „ May 8. „ — Coleshill-street . m. „ 32 ,, „ 15. „ — St. George's-ter. f. „ 4 w. unvaccinated June 9. „ — Gloucester-street m. „ 19 days „ „ 14. „ — Warwick-street . m. „ 55 „ 12 special case. Dr. Aldis applied at the Westminster Police Court, on April 11th, to procure the immediate interment of a child three years of age, the daughter of poor persons, living at No. 12, Spring Gardens, Pimlico. He stated that Mr. Badderly, one of the overseers, had informed him that the mother of the child, which had died of small-pox, refused to allow it to be buried. The overseer had sent William Osborne, who has charge of the parish funerals, to take away the child, but the mother screamed and made so much noise that a number of Irish people immediately collected, and he was glad to leave the place. He had placed the child in a coffin, but she had taken it out and returned it to the place where it had been previously laid. The husband stated that he could not raise money to defray the expenses of a burial, and therefore wished the child to be removed, and be interred by the parish; but the wife objected to this, and wished it to remain until 6he could raise sufficient money by subscription to inter it herself. On April 10th, Dr. Aldis went to the house with Mr. Grant, to endeavour to persuade the wife to have the body removed, but she positively refused. The child lay exposed in a small back room, in which three other children and the father and mother lived and slept, and, although it was only a six roomed house, it was tenanted by 26 souls, all of whom were necessarily exposed to the influence of contagion. Small-pox was prevalent in the district. Mr. Selfe believed that he had no power to interfere in such a case, but thought it highly essential that the body should be removed as soon as possible. Acting under the authority of the father, who was desirous that the child should be interred, he thought that the parish 13 officers might proceed to exercise the power he was entitled to give them, and suggested that the police should be in attendance to prevent any breach of the peace being committed. Before an application was made to the magistrate, a notice had been served for whitewashing and cleansing the rooms, for lime-washing the yard, area, and water closet, trapping two sinks, covering the dust pit, and cleansing the drains forthwith.

No. III. gas. Seventy-two observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act. With regard to the purity of the gases, they were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that thev did not discolour the turmeric naner.

HAN 13 No. XXIV.] QUARTERLY SUMMARY OP THE SICKNESS AND MORTALITY IN THE PARISH OF Saint George, Banoder Squar, AND Of THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 26th, 1863. London: PRINTED BY GEORGE PHIPPS, UPPER RANELAGH STREET, PIMLICO, S.W. to the Vestrn of St. George, Banober Square. My Lords and Gentlemen, The deaths in the parish during this quarter were 418, if we include those of two inmates of Little Chelsea Workhouse, and of 60 non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. The corrected average of deaths for the foregoing ten years is 400, so that we have this quarter about 1 death per week over that average, which is not more than is reasonably due to increased population in the Belgrave sub-district.

It is amongst the children, 4 and therefore in the Belgrave sub-district, where the births are most numerous, that the highest mortality has happened. Twenty-six out of the 31 deaths from bowel disorder occurred in the Belgrave sub-district; and out of the 31 in the whole parish, 29 were under 5, two over 60. When we speak of preventable diseases, we would fain include under that term not only diseases caused by poisonous emanations, which may be got rid of by cleanliness and drainage, but the effects of heat and cold likewise, which greater knowledge and greater care may be expected to diminish. We have often before spoken of the conditions under which diarrhoea is prevalent, and of the extreme nicety in diet, and particularly in the quality of the milk to be given to young children. Even with all care great heat will disorder some delicate children; but it is a source of mischief that may be guarded against more often than it is. The following entries in the Register show one of the real causes of Death from diarrhoea:— "20 August, 1863. No.— George Yard, Grosvenor Square, m, 7 weeks, son of a domestic servant. Impaired nutrition; brought up by hand; diarrhœa, aphthæ, convulsions, 5 weeks" In the week ending 1st August, two infants, one ten days old, the other three weeks, are returned as dying of "inanition" i.e., starvation "from want of breast milk" "4 July. No. Cumberland-street,f., 3 weeks, daughter of a governess; diarrhœa, 3 days, from artificial food." Passing over the small-pox, which shall be noticed presently, we remark that the deaths from measles were few, but those from scarlatina, and other maladies affecting the throat, were heavy. Scarlatina, diphtheria, and croup together destroyed 31 lives. These diseases give us the greatest anxiety from their intensely contagious nature, and 5 from the extreme difficulty of destroying contagion in clothes and bedding, even though the walls may be cleansed. In any such cases we endeavour, if possible, to get patients removed to the Fever Hospital, so as to weed out the infected person, and have one pair of lungs the less in the poor man's room; and to get the room emptied and cleansed as soon as possible. Great as the inconvenience may be, we are certain that frequent changes of apartment are amongst the best modes of giving that amount of airing to the goods and bedding which are requisite to keep the poor man's home healthy. No maladies hang about houses more pertinaciously than these, and they show themselves from time to time in the guise of sore throats, even when there is no fever with them. The places where deaths occurred from those fevers were, Three King's-yard Davies-street, Park-street Grosvenorsquare, Gray's livery-stables Mount-street, Grantham-place, (two cases of croup in one family,) Hertford-place, Hartstreet, and Brown-street; Little Chester-street, St. George'sroad, Cambridge-terrace, Eaton-mews south, Upper Eburystreet, Eccleston-square, Cambridge-terrace, Glasgow-terrace, (two cases, one of scarlet fever, the other of diphtheria, in two families,) Upper Tachbrook-street, Stanley-street, Westmoreland-street, and Sutherland-place. Of the nine deaths classed under the head of typhus, five were those of non-parishioners in St. George's Hospital. The remainder occurred in Eaton-lane north, Stanley-street, Hanover-place Bond-street, and Lupus-street. The number of persons who died of maladies of degeneration and bad development was 115; including 4 from premature birth, 1 from malformation, 19 from atrophy and debility, 11 from teething, 9 from tabes mesenterica, 43 from consumption, 13 from water and inflammation in the head, and 15 from children's convulsions. 6 Twenty-seven deaths from accidents or negligence appear on the register, and although 13 were deaths of nonparishioners in St. George's Hospital, still the remaining 14 is a large number of parishioners for one quarter. One parishioner was killed by a fall at the International Exhibition, one other, a builder, by a fall; one man by fighting, 8 by accidents with horses and carriages. One child was scalded by pulling a cup of tea over himself ; a woman died from falling when drunk; a carpenter was killed by a plumb bob which fell on him; one woman fell from a window sill on which she was sitting; a girl of 17, upset from a boat, was crushed between a barge and Putney Bridge; a waiter at a tavern fell with a bottle, which broke and cut his wrist; a gardener died through falling from a tree. Two boys Were drowned in the Thames, and a boy of 12 whilst bathing in the Serpentine. One woman poisoned herself with bitter almonds ; and a man hanged himself. One newly-born infant was found under a tree in Hyde Park with a cord round its neck; it was taken to St. George's Hospital and died in two hours; another was found dead, and was said by the Coroner's jury to have been suffocated; one which was said to have been still-born was found in the Grosvenor canal. This last was not legally entitled to registry, as a child not born alive has no existence in law. A child four months old was suffocated whilst in bed with its parents in Brown-street. 7 THE SICKNESS IN THE HANOVER AND MAYFAIR SUB-DISTRICTS. During these three months the number of patients treated by the Parochial Medical Officers, and at the Dispensary, and in the sick wards of the Workhouse, Mount-street, was 1,047. In this number are included 22 persons received into the small-pox wards in Mount-street Workhouse, from the Hanover and Mayfair sub-districts, and 7 from Belgravia, besides 6 patients treated for small-pox at home ; 6 sent to the Small-pox Hospital from the Hanover and Mayfair subdistricts, and 3 from Belgravia. There were 21 cases of measles, 18 of scarlatina, 2 of diphtheria, 7 of whooping-cough, 64 of diarrhoea, 20 of fever, one of erysipelas, one of delirium tremens, and 84 of bronchitis. SICKNESS IN THE BELGRAVE SUB-DISTRICT. In the Belgrave Sub-District 8,455 persons were treated by the Parochial Surgeons, and at St. George's Hospital, the Royal Pimlico Dispensary, the St. Paul and St. Barnabas' Dispensary, and at the Workhouse, Little Chelsea. Of these, 4,805 were patients at St. George's Hospital, leaving a remainder of 3,650. The total figures include 12 of small-pox, 18 of chicken-pox, 19 of measles, 12 of scarlet-fever, 54 of whooping-cough, 2 of croup, 528 of diarrhoea, 9 of dysentery, 42 of continued fever, 44 of rheumatic fever, 21 of erysipelas, 5 of diphtheria, and 4 of carbuncle. 8 There were 347 cases of bronchitis, 9 of pleurisy, and 27 of pneumonia. THE SMALL-POX. If we continue the history of this disease in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-districts, we may observe, that whereas there were two cases in December 1862, 18 during the first quarter of 1863, and 45 during the second quarter, there were 46 during the third. Out of these 46 cases, 22 were received into the wards at Mount-street; 6 were sent to the Small-pox Hospital, 6 were treated at home, and the remaining 12 were persons who employed their own medical attendant, and were only heard of casually. Very likely there were some others, for, as we observed in the foregoing Report, it is to the interest of most people to keep such a malady secret. It is our duty occasionally to enquire into the existence of contagious diseases at hotels and lodging houses, and the establishments of milliners, &c; and as we always meet with the greatest frankness in giving information, and find our suggestions most gladly followed out, we refrain from any publicity, unless there is some reason for it. The deaths from this disease in the Hanover Sub-district were two. 4th July. A maid-servant, set. 32, at No. Daviesstreet, said to have been vaccinated. 17th August. A lady, set. 65, at No. Upper Grosvenor-street. Confluent small-pox, fatal on the 13th day of eruption; also said to have been vaccinated In the Mayfair Sub-district one death. "6th August. F. 3 weeks, daughter of a tradesman, No. 9 Brick-street. Confluent small-pox one week. Mother had small-pox on the third day after delivery. The infant was vaccinated. The mother recovered." In the Workhouse the deaths registered were 5. June 21. Infant of Maria H., born in the Workhouse 30th May; attacked with small-pox June 14, died 21st. Mentioned in last Quarterly Report, p. 10, not registered till this quarter. Vaccination did not take. June 21. James C., set. 26, native of Diss, Norfolk; admitted from No. 5, Whittaker-street, Pimlico. Never vaccinated. 28th June. Amelia S., 3£, from No. 4, Union-street, Bond-street. No vaccine marks. 2nd July. C. W., set. 3, from the same house. Not vaccinated. (These last four cases were admitted last quarter, and reckoned amongst the total number of small-pox cases for that quarter; although they were not registered, and could not be included in our death table till this quarter. We do not include them in the total 46 for this quarter.) 9th July. George B., stableman, set. 26, admitted to the sick wards from a lodging in South-street on 28th June. Vaccinated. The deaths in the Belgrave Sub-district were two. 5th August. A coachman, set. 35, at 90 Eaton-mews. Confluent small-pox 10 days. Vaccinated. 8th August. A boy aged 6 weeks, at 1, Eliza-place. Unvaccinated, Of the small-pox cases generally, the histories are these— Out of the 6 parish cases treated at home, four were children in a family named G., at 8, Thomas-street, aged respectively 12, 10, and 7 years, and 15 months. The last had not been vaccinated—the others had been. A child named 10 w., set. 2½, at 18, North Bruton-mews; and one named H., of a year, at 5, Lancashire-court. Both vaccinated. Of the 12 patients who employed their own medical attendant, three who died, and one other, have alreadv been mentioned when speaking of the deaths in the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-districts. One other was butler to a family in Chapel-street. Four were children in one family in Georgestreet, Oxford-street, aged 8, 6, 4, and 2. All had been vaccinated, and had the small-pox very slightly. These children had been examined by us some weeks before, as to their vaccination, in company with Mr. Jay. It was remarked that their vaccine scars were very indistinct, which was ascribed by Mr. Jay, and justly, in all probability, to the extremely rickety and ill-developed state of the children. A young woman named S., who left 18, North Bruton-mews, at the beginning of August, to go to a situation at Brighton, was taken ill with small-pox soon after her arrival. A boy named S., aged 15, at 8, Thomas-street, vaccinated, had small-pox; no medical attendant. There was one other case of which nothing is known. Of the 22 patients admitted to the sick wards, Mountstreet, from the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-districts, and of which one, G. B., mentioned above, proved fatal, 19 were adults varying from 16 to 50 years of age, all vaccinated but one. There was a child of nine, who had been twice vaccinated ; one of 10, and one of 7. The seven patients admitted from the Belgrave Sub-district were all adults, except a girl of 13, and all vaccinated. There were sent to the Small-pox Hospital six patients from the Hanover and Mayfair Sub-districts, and three from the Belgrave; one 64 years of age, another who died, 45, child of 6. One of them was a young man of 23, one of 11 four brothers, all unvaccinated, and all of whom suffered from small-pox. It cannot be said that, so far as our parish is concerned, the neglect of vaccination has to be blamed for the prevalence of small-pox. The proportion of children attacked is small; and although, in two or three cases, several members of one family, and several inmates of one house, were attacked in succession, yet this was not common, and the mass of the population were well protected. It is marvellous that the dense population of Lancashire-court and Grosvenor-mews escaped as they did. In several instances, one house, or even one patient, might be affected with more than one of these contagious disorders together, or in close succession. In the last Report, we spoke of a child at No. 4, John's-court, who died of scarlatina and small-pox. At No. 23, Grosvenor-market, measles, scarlatina, and small-pox were present in the same house, and one patient had measles and small-pox in close succession. In Quarterly Summary, No. XXII., we speak of a girl of 13, named T., who was sent from No. 4, Thomasstreet, with scarlet fever to the Fever Hospital, on 29th January. She was sent home on 15th February, and died on 13th March. She was kept unburied for ten days, and our interference was called for by the occupier of the house, in order to get her interred. In May her father, mother, and sister, set. 4, were seized with typhus. The father died on 25 th May, the rest recovered. Then the disease attacked a woman named B. in the next room. This family consisted of a husband who worked at Clerkenwell, and only spent Sunday at home, his wife, and two grown-up daughters of the wife by a former husband. The wife was seriously ill, and had a narrow escape. Of course our exertions were 12 remitting to get the only remedy applied which could be of any avail to stop the mischief; that is to have the infected rooms emptied of their tenants and cleansed; and to give the tenants the benefit of fresh quarters for the recovery of their health, and for the purification of their apparel and goods. Meanwhile the drains of the house became stopped up, and a most dangerous nuisance was created. The removal of the sick persons was of course postponed till they were able to be moved with safety, and then they resisted it, and were only got out by the intervention of the magistrate at Marlboroughstreet. A summons was taken out June 22nd, heard on the 29th, adjourned to July 8th, and again to the 15th, when the families were reported to have been removed, the rooms cleansed and fresh windows put in, for their better ventilation in future. But this was not all. One of the daughters, Louisa, set. 17, of the last-named family, came to Mount-street with the small-pox on 11th July; and her sister Rosa, set. 19, on the 17th, having, in the meanwhile, been living at Islington, and at a Roman Catholic Refuge in Robert-street. This last patient had not only small-pox but typhus. Here is a history of six or seven months of illness—scarlet fever, typhus, and small-pox, in a most crowded and ill-ventilated house, in which the greatest exertions were necessary to induce* the persons affected, to make any move for their own benefit. It is in such cases, which luckily do not happen very often in so aggravated a form, that our functions are highly useful to the community. We only wish that our powers were a little more summary. Measles,' scarlet fever, and small-pox were present at 18, North Bruton-mews, and 3, Queen-street, Oxford-street; measles, small-pox, and diphtheria at 10, Adam's-mews. 13 VISITATION OF MILLINERS. At this season great excitement was produced in town by the alleged death of a milliner's assistant in Regent-street, from overwork and bad ventilation, and as is usual on such occasions, a great deal of strong language was used, and statements put forward, which, when examined, were found to be scarcely supported by fact. As a specimen, we may refer to a letter sent to Dr. Lankester, the coroner for Middlesex, and by him forwarded to us, making the strongest possible assertions as to the " miseries that thousands of helpless young women are subjected to," speaking of the " horrors of the work and sleeping rooms," of the long hours of work, the insufficient remuneration, and giving Dr. Lankester the names of six milliners in this parish, as examples. We may remind the Yestry, that so far as our powers extend, we are most careful to exercise them in behalf of helpless women. Whenever any maid-servant (or any other servant) is, to our knowledge, sent to a hospital or to the sick wards in Mount-street with any fever, we always cause an inspection of the premises to be made from which she is sent: more especially, if we hear either of illness or death from any such complaint in any milliner's establishment; and if there were not valid reasons against publishing names, we could point out several houses of repute, in which the greatest pains have been taken to explore and remove causes of illness. We called at four of the six establishments denounced to Dr. Lankester—for the other two had been removed. In the first, only two young women slept on the premises, in a well-ventilated room, affording each nearly 700 cubic feet of space. 14 In the second, there were twelve girls who slept on the premises, and two day workers. They worked in a well lighted and ventilated room, which afforded each worker 668 cubic feet of space. Four of them slept in two double beds in a top attic, where they had 378 cubic feet a-piece. Two others in another front attic, with 420 cubic feet a-piece. Four others in a back attic, with 252 cubic feet a-piece. Two others with a servant in a third attic, with 351 cubic feet a-piece. The working hours, during the three months of the season, were from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; during the rest of the year, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. The other two milliners' establishments which were visited, were not inspected so minutely, but there was nothing in any one of them to justify any allegation that they were worse than their neighbours; and in all, the food, and the general comfort and moral tone were good. We are perfectly willing to enter into more minute investigations, and to suggest remedies for any evils that may be detected, if we should be invited by the proprietors of these establishments, or if we should be desired by the Vestry. Meanwhile there are one or two practical points which we have on several occasions spoken of, with regard to the treatment of the younger girls, and may here repeat. 1. Many young girls enter that business, whose health is quite unfit for any sedentary indoor occupation; scrofula, consumption, and debility, have already marked them for victims. Such apprentices should be rejected. 2. Girls so occupied, require great care of the skin ; but it is not easy to induce them to use cold water in the mornings. 3. They should be allowed a little exercise early in the day. 4. They should have a 15 ter breakfast than the miserable tea and bread-and-butter. All mistresses complain that the forenoons are wasted in yawning, and languor, and idle talk. A good bath, followed by a good breakfast and a little run in the open air, would put a stop to this. 5. They should be encouraged to buy fruit when in season, oranges, salad, &c., &c. 6. More than 12 hours' work a day is but a pretence; they may sit and seem to work, but do not. We believe that if the most eminent firms, who show great intelligence and humanity in all that regards the welfare of their households, could be induced by some persons of influence to initiate some such reforms, that the whole trade would be benefitted. Work would be better done, the health of the young persons engaged in it be improved, and a reproach taken off our countrywomen, as regards their treatment of helpless members of their own sex. Whilst saying this we add, that there would not be much ground of complaint, if these establishments were as well conducted elsewhere as they are in our Parish. SPECIAL CASES. Dr. Aldis summoned a Special Meeting of the Nuisances Removal Committee, on Aug. 1, 1863, to authorize a summons to be taken out against the owner of a house in Sutherland Street, Pimlico, who, after receiving a notice, had refused to remedy a nuisance, which had caused the occupier, an aged and poor woman, to suffer from severe diarrhoea. In consequence of her sufferings, and the house being filled with lodgers, it became necessary that the effluvia should be abated forthwith. The defendant appeared at the Westminster Police Court, on Aug. 5, when he pleaded guilty and consented to do the work within 48 hours. 16 Your Medical Officer of Health also attended the same Court, on Aug. 26, to hear the result of a summons, taken out by the police under Michael Angelo Taylor's Act, against the keeper of pigs in Union Place, Chelsea, which, it was alleged, had seriously affected the health of a family residing in Belgrave Cottages. The defendant pleaded guilty, and all the pigs were removed. No. 6, Warrad's Court, Ebury Square. A notice was served on the owner, in consequence of the front room on the first floor being overcrowded by a man, his wife, and six children. Moreover, the house was dirty, and No. 5 was infected with small-pox. The family have removed, and both houses have been whitewashed and cleansed. C. J. B. ALDIS, M.D. R. DEUITT. 17 APPENDIX. No. I.

J. B. A. DRINKING WATERS OF LONDON AND PARIS. Believing that it would be a matter of interest to compare the water supply of the two greatest capitals in Europe, wc procured, by the agency of a Parisian chemist, a supply of the Seine water, just as was delivered to a house in the Rue St. Honore, on September 21, 1863. It was bright, but contained threads of conferva, and a few vegetable debris, which were separated by filtration before analysis, which was effected by a professional chemist. The water supplied by the Grand Junction Company, September 30, yielded— Organic impurity Inorganic Total 1.70 14.97 16.67 grains per gallon. 18 Amongst the inorganic was— Chlorine 0.69 grains per gallon. Sulphuric acid 1.36 „ „ The chlorine indicates the presence of common salt in the proportion of 1.13 grains to the gallon. Degrees, or grains of lime per gallon. The hardness permanent, i. e., that which remains after boiling Temporary, i.e., removed by boiling . Total hardness 4.8 7.9 12.7 The Seine water contained— Organic impurity Inorganic Total 3.40 23.84 27.24 grains per gallon Amongst the inorganic— Chlorine Sulphuric acid. 0.27 4.94 grains per gallon. „ „ Hardness permanent „ Temporary Total Grains or degrees per gallon. 9.8 6.2 16.0 By this it will be seen that the London water was superior to the Parisian, so far as the chemistry of these two samples can decide it, both in wholesomeness as a drink, and for cooking and washing. The London water contained a trifle more common salt; a thing which always creates suspicion of contamination by the animal 19 tions which are drained into the Thames in its course: on the other hand it contained much less sulphuric acid, which forms a very unpalatable and unwholesome compound with lime, and it was less hard, in the proportion of 12.7 to 16, and more capable of being softened by boiling, therefore less wasteful of soap and tea, inasmuch after boiling it retained only 4.8 degrees of "permanent hardness," whilst the Parisian retained 9.8. 20 APPENDIX.

No. III. GAS. Seventy-three observations were made during the quarter upon the six gases supplied by the Chartered, London, and Equitable Companies, at the Works in Horseferry-road, 73, Bessborough-street, and 78, Cambridge-street, respectively. The gases were burned in accordance with the Metropolis Gas Act, 1860, and the illuminating power continued above the standard light required by the Act, except on August the 5th, when the Cannel gas from the London Company gave an average light equal to 19*59 instead of 20 sperm candles. With respect to purity, all the gases were free from sulphuretted hydrogen, and so far free from ammonia that they did not discolour the turmeric paper. Ihe following I able gives the average light in sperm candles of all the gases. Chartered. London. Equitable.
