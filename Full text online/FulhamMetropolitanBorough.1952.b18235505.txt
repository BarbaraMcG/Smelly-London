To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF FULHAM. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the health of the Borough of Fulham for the year 1952. As in former years the report follows the form indicated to Medical Officers by the Minister of Health and includes the report of your Public Analyst, Mr, T. McLachlan, A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., on 800 samples of food and drugs examined, and a report from Dr. H,C. Price, Chest Physician of the Fulham Chest Clinic, which gives details of the tuberculosis position in Fulham. I should like to record my indebtedness for their contributions. The mid-year population of the Borough, estimated by the Registrar General, is given as 122,800, showing a slight increase from 1951 (122,400) . The Birth Rate, 13.99 per 1,000 is a trifle lower than the 1951 figure (14,04. per 1,000); the Still Birth Rate is 0.3 (compared with 0.34 in 1951) and the Infantile Mortality Rate of 25.6 per 1,000 births the second lowest on record for this Borough - shows a further slight decline on the previous year's figure (26,5 in 1951). The Death Rate, including all forms of tuberculosis, is also lower 11,9 (compared with 12.9 in 1951). The number of deaths in the Borough was 1,461. There was one maternal death, giving a rate of 57 per 1,000 births. In 1951 the figure was .58 per 1,000 births. Fog in London is always a serious matter. In the early part of December, London experienced for four days a most serious fog which, it is estimated, was responsible for some 4,000 deaths in Greater London. There were 47 such deaths in Fulham, details of which appear in the main report. The Ministry of Health, with the co-operation of Borough Medical Officers of Health, made a full investigation into all deaths due to fog, including an investigation of any existing infection in the home or other predisposing factors. It may be of interest to note the following:- (5) "The County of London, with an area of 120 square miles, contains twenty power-stations, consuming between them 3¼ million tons of coal a year. In 20 square miles of south-west London about 65% of the coal burnt is burnt at the Battersea, Fulham and Lots Road power stations."җ The latter fact, where Fulham is concerned, is most significant as one of the three power-stations is in Fulham and another is on its border. The statistical records for the year show that the health of the Borough, as a whole, continues to be maintained at a satisfactory standard. It compares favourably with London and the Country generally. The number of cases of notifiable infectious diseases has continued to decline, with the exception of scarlet fever, poliomyelitis and all types of tuberculosis. No case of typhoid or paratyphoid has occurred, nor any outbreak of food poisoning. There has been no diphtheria in the Borough since 1949. The Council's policy of requiring a high standard of hygiene for food handlers and premises used in the preparation, storage and sale of food has been continued. A team, composed of one Senior Food Inspector and three Special Food Inspectors, was formed in 1949 with the specific purpose of carrying out a complete survey of all food establishments in the Borough and to give advice on all matters connected with food hygiene. The results of three years continuous uphill work by the team is beginning to make evident improvements in the condition of food premises and equipment as well as higher hygienic standards being adopted by food handlers. In Fulham there are many one-man businesses and the kitchen accommodation is often inadequate for the number of meals served. I regret to report that as in previous years continued difficulty has been experienced in bringing about reasonable standards of fitness in existing housing accommodation. Much of the housing in the Borough is old, worn out, lacking in modern amenities and not worth patching up, with resulting progressive deterioration. The year 1952 saw a modest but welcome resumption of slum clearance action. The London County Council received Ministerial approval of clearance proposals affecting premises in Fane Street, Fane Place and Star Road. At the time of writing, demolition works are practically completed in this area. The County Council also represented a much larger area comprising premises in Bulow Road, Langford Road and Pearscroft Road as ripe for clearance. These proposals have also been "confirmed". This җ "Lancet" March 21st, 1953, page 603. (6) slum clearance, in addition to clearance and redevelopment operations undertaken by the Borough Council in the Avenues and Lillie Road areas, and on smaller sites elsewhere, has brought about a re-housing problem. After most careful consideration, the Council decided that its flats and dwellings as a whole must be made available for "decanting" purposes. Whilst this means that the occupation of new dwellings by families from the Housing Register will have to be delayed for a time, in the long run the Council's decision makes possible the re-housing of more families selected from the Housing Register than would otherwise be the case. The work in connection with the care of old people has increased. As the facilities available become known o the old folk, more seek to take advantage of them. It is gratifying to report that under Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, it is possible to cleanse the garments and bedding used by the incontinent. This service began this year and is operated without charge. Once again I am indebted to members of the Council for their continued help and co-operation and especially to the Chairmen and ViceChairmen of the Public Health and Staff Committees, who have been most understanding and helpful in their consideration of special Public Health and Staff problems. I would like again to record my appreciation to all Chief Officers and members of their Departments for their unfailing help and take this opportunity of conveying to the staff of the Public Health Department my thanks for the efficient and loyal way each one. has carried out his or her duties during the year and made this report possible. I have the honour to be, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, M.I adams (7) EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR 1952.

Smallpox: There were no contacts of smallpox or persons from smallpox areas abroad requiring observation during the year. Poliomye- 32 suspect cases were admitted to hospital for observation litis: during the year. Of these 12 cases were confirmed as suffering from paralytic poliomyelitis and 2 cases confirmed as suffering from non-paralytic poliomyelitis. Of the total number of cases, 4 occurred in children under 5 years, 5 occurred in children of school age and the regaining 5 cases were adult. Food There were no outbreaks of food poisoning but 8 isolated Poisoning: casas were notified. There is no doubt that a considerable amount of food poisoning exists which is not notified as those suffering from it do not consult their doctor unless they are seriously ill. It is then usually impossible to obtain and investigate suspected articles of food. Scabies and Treatment was arranged for 38 adults and 6 children at the allied con- Kensington Medicinal Baths. ditions: Dysentery: There were 35 cases of dysentery notified during the year, but in three instances diagnosis was not confirmed. Of the confirmed cases 31 notifications were in respect of Sonne dysentery. This compares with the total of 71 notifications during the previous year. (14) SONNE DYSENTERY Investigations into 31 confirmed notifications in respect of Sonne dysentery were carried out by Dr. Meade, the Deputy Medical Officer of Health. The terminal phase of the outbreak which affected the Sands End area in the last quarter of. 1951 accounted for 15 cases in the first six weeks of 1952. These were for the most part, secondary cases or "carriers" occurring in affected households. The regaining 16 cases were isolated incidents occurring throughout the year, The methods adopted for preventing the spread of infeotion were as follows:- On receipt of a notification a home visit was paid. Besides enquiry as to possible sources of the infection and the risks to others, the method of spread was explained and a pamphlet bearing a list of necessary precautionary measures was given. At the same time samples for bacteriological examination were requested from all members of the household, whether any history of suspicious illness was found or not, the aim being to secure a series of three negative specimens from each such member. The Laboratory at the West London Hospital was most co-operative in giving early telephone information in respect of any positive result being obtained so that the patient's practitioner concerned could be informed and treatment begun, notifications obtained and any necessary action taken in respect of exclusion of children from Day Nurseries, schools, etc. Of the 297 faeces examinations carried out in 1952, 194 were in respect of the Public Health Department's investigations of Sonne Dysentery (61 in the first six weeks of the year) and a further 84 were made at the request of general practitioners. A balance of 19 such examinations are accounted for in respect of other infections, Throughout the General Practitioners proved most co-operative, but it would be of assistance to this Department if earlier notification was given as action cannot be taken till knowledge of the position is available. It is felt that these means have not only assisted in the prevention of the spread of infection, but have been of undoubted educational propaganda value to the public in assisting a realization as to the nature and method of spread of this disease. (15) On the 1st November a special Sonne dysentery investigation was begun, which is being carried out throughout London, to discover the effect of environment on the spread of infection by an analysis of all notified cases. This investigation, so far as the Boroughs are concerned, includes, besides particulars of the notified case (including the severity and duration), a list of other household members, particulars of housing, nature of the outbreak and development of secondary cases. EXCLUSION FROM WORK OF CONTACTS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE Under the National Insurance Act of 194-6, a certificate can be issued in any case where the Medical Officer of Health considers it advisable that a person should be excluded from work. This is usually done where a person is suspected of being a "carrier" of a disease, or has been in contact with a disease, and where the person, because of the nature of his/her occupation, is liable to transmit the diseases (e.g. a food handler). The granting of such a certificate enables the person affected to claim sickness benefit. No certificates were issued during the year. (16) (17) EXTRACTS FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE FULHAM CHEST CLINIC. Incidence: The situation in Fulham has mirrored the general trend of the country as a whole. The number of notified cases falling from 232 in 1950 to 191 in 1952, a fall of 17.6% giving an incidence of 155 per 100,000 which compares with 155.5 for the County of London. It will be noted that there has been a steady fall in the population of Wards, excepting Hurlingham, where a new Housing Estate has been built in the old Polo Ground. Whereas some of the Wards show a fall in incidence, three, Walham, Munster and Lillie, show a slight rise. This cannot be attributed to any special investigation by the Mass Radiography, since the only Ward where this was carried out was in Town in 1951. Deaths: The number of deaths has fallen in two years from 58 to 24. (58.6%) giving a rate of 19.54 for the year, which compares with 30.3 for the County of London.

They operated from two centres; a Hall in Fulham Road, and the Public Baths, Walham Green. A special effort was made to examine as many persons as possible from Walham Ward and over 1,000 residents of this area were examined. The success of this visit was largely due to the publicity given to it and here the co-operation received from the doctors, dentists and chemists in the Borough was a very great help. The results of the visit were as follows:- A total of 10,612 people were examined 5,367 men and 5,245 women. 35 men and 24 women had radiologically significant lesions. 32 men and 19 women were followed up with an occasional film by the Mass X-Ray Service. 4 men had chest lesions, probably not tuberculous, of sufficient seriousness to merit investigation at a chest hospital. This total of 114 persons (1.07%) requiring further treatment is considered satisfactory. A further 719 films showed abnormalities of no clinical significance and these people received the usual "satisfactory" notification. BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS The following bacteriological examinations were carried out during the year 1952 at the West London Hospital for the Council:- Nose & Throat swabs 92 Urines 2 Faeces 297 Miscellaneous 2 (21) HOSPITALS IN THE BOROUGH OF FULHAM Details supplied by courtesy of the Fulham & Kensington Hospital Management Committee.

(22) FOG DEATHS The four days of fog referred to in my introduction, had its aftermath. During the two weeks ending December 20th which followed the fog, 120 deaths of Fulham residents were notified. The average for the corresponding period in 1950 and 1951 was 78. Enquiries by letter from hospital physicians, general practitioners and the coroner (11 instances) showed that 47 of the above 120 deaths might be considered as attributable to fog in a greater or lesser degree. In order to discover factors which might predispose susceptibility, home enquiries were made in respect of the above 47 cases. No contact could, however, be made in three of these. Of the remaining 44 it seemed unlikely in 4 cases that the fog was more than coincidental with the deaths. The general picture of the 44 investigated cases may be summarised broadly as follows:- (1) Well enough to be "up and about", although activity times limited 30 (2) Those going out to work or doing housework at home etc 14 (3) Those considered in good or very fair health 13 Note: All those at work were not necessarily in good health. A number of retired or old persons could on the other hand be so considered in relation to their age. (4) Confined to one room, either because of old age or on account of chronic illness 14. (5) Of the latter regarded by the family as "going downhill" (includes the 4 "not fog") 7 Predisposing Factors. (a) Chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease, or both together 38 Note: A number of these became acutely ill in various ways during the fog, e.g. developed bronchial pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute cardiac failure etc. (b) Asthma: This condition, although not often referred to on the death certificate, appeared from family enquiries to be a factor in 21 (The sole infant death was one. An allergic family history in this case was definitely obtained, as also in that of five others). (23) (c) Infection in the Hone: An acute or sub-acute infection (acute bronchitis, colds, pneumonia, etc.) was present before the fog in 16 (Only in 2 or 3 cases was a current infection acknowledged in the house). (d) Of the six cases in which a history of chronic heart or lung disease was not definitely elicited four were over 80 years of age; one of these was aged 98; a second practically bedridden; a third had also a different illness; a fourth was said to look after herself and her own room; a fifth of the six cases was aged 70, did her own work in the home, and was seized with acute pulmonary oedema during the fog. The sixth was an infant of four months, of allergic family history. Besides the final illness it had had one previous attack suggestive of asthma, and several colds. It was the only death under 50 years of age. Age Groups Over 90 1 Over 80 7 Over 70 12 Over 60 19 Over 50 7 4 months 1 47 (24) General. Relatives remarked in several cases on the acute distress caused by the fog, while others said that the deceased had in the past been able to tell when a fog was imminent by its effect on their breathing. Five persons were investigated whose deaths were not considered due to fog, in addition to the above group, and in all 67 calls were made. It was not always possible to contact relatives, some of the deceased persons having been no more than lodgers in furnished rooms etc. In the great majority of cases, those interviewed were most cooperative in doing their best to give the particulars asked for. However, the generous response of the many medical practitioners to the initial letter of enquiry provided the essential information upon which the home enquiry could be conducted with advantage, and provided valuable guidance. PUBLIC MORTUARY The following number of bodies were admitted to the Mortuary during the year:- By order of the Coroner 256 Convenience Cases (i.e. admitted at the request of Undertakers) 161 Total 417 Number of Post-Mortem Examinations conducted 256 (25) OLD PEOPLES' WELFARE An increasing proportion of time is spent by the Department in dealing with the problems of old people. It is interesting to observe by reference to the following figures and the diagram on population trends (page 26) how rapidly the proportion of old people is increasings:- In 1851 there were 47 people aged 65 for every 1000 population. ,, 1891 " " 48 " " " " " " " " 1911 " " 53 " " " " " " " " 1939 " " 89 " " " " " " " " 1947 " " 105 " " " " " " " and it is estimated that " 1977 " will be 160 people aged 65 for every 1000 population. During the year 975 visits were paid to aged persons, 232 of which were primary visits and 743 re-inspections. Many of these old persons were removed on a voluntary basis to hospitals, institutions and private homes while the majority were able, through liaison with the various voluntary and statutory social services, to continue living in their own homes under very much better conditions. In only one case was it necessary to remove an old person compulsorily under the National Assistance (Amendment) Act,1951. It is a pleasure to record that the Fulham Housing Improvement Society Ltd. have acquired premises on Putney Hill to be known as the Fulham Old Peoples' Home. These premises which have been modernised and adapted to suit the particular requirements of old people has accommodation for 35 residents of both sexes. A typical example of one of the old persons dealt with is as follows: Reported by the landlord to be living alone in a top floor back room, an old lady (aged 84) was found on a broken-down bed. Her mouth was festered with sores. She was unable to eat and was in a weak and enfeebled condition. It was found that she had been ill for some days and was not on a doctor's list. The nearest local general practitioner promptly visited on request, and the patient was removed to hospital. Discharged after treatment, new bedding and personal clothing were supplied, a Home Help cleaned and prepared the room, and arrangements were made for the service of regular meals from the Invalid Kitchens. This patient has now made a remarkable recovery. She takes a new interest in life and looks forward to her daily routine with zest. On a recent visit the room was found to be spotlessly clean. (26) (27) NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT. 1948. Section 50: Burial or Cremation of the Dead. Eleven funerals were arranged under the provisions of this Section. The funerals were carried out by Mr. J. Goulborn of 61, Greyhound Road, the Council's official Contractor. Details of the cost of the Burials are as follows:- *11 Funerals as per contract £128. 6s. 0d. Less amount recovered from estate of deceased, or by gifts, or responsible relatives traced £49. ls.l0d. Balance being cost to Council £79. 4s. 2d. *The cost of the funerals varies slightly, the average cost of an adult being approximately £11. 10s.0d. Section 47: National Assistance Act. 1948.) Removal to suitable preNational Assistance (Amendment) Act. 1951.) mises of persons in need of care and attention. One removal was made under the provisions of the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, which is only used when a case is so urgent that delay, necessary to comply with the provisions of Section 47, might prove fatal. In this particular case a very strong willed old lady of 90 was discovered, living alone in an insanitary condition and when the case was first reported she had had no food for three days. This was primarily due to her having exhausted the kindness and patience of her neighbours. Orders made under the Amendment Act are only operative for a maximum period of 3 weeks and during this period - whilst the old lady was in the Institution - a further application was granted under Section 47 in order to keep her in the Institution for an additional 3 months. At the end of this time she had settled down quite comfortably in the Institution and it was unnecessary to apply for any further extensions. (28) SERVICE FOR INCOTINENT PERSONS Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, enables a sanitary authority, on a report from the Medical Officer of Health, to cleanse or destroy any filthy or verminous articles within its district. As one of the greatest problems of the home nursing of aged and incontinent persons is the cleansing of their bed clothing and personal linen it was decided to start a scheme under the provisions of Section 122 whereby this work could be carried out at the Disinfecting Station by the Disinfecting Superintendent and his staff. It was arranged that the District Nursing Association, who supply extra bed linen when needed, should notify the Department whenever they had a suitable case, and the linen of the person would then be collected and delivered twice weekly, depending on the case, not all cases requiring a twice-weekly service. This scheme, which came into operation in March, has been a great success and has been deeply appreciated, particularly by the relatives of the old people on whom the burden of nursing falls. From March to the end of the year the following articles were cleansed:- From March to the end of the year the following articles were cleansed Sheets 1826 Towels 170 Pillow Cases 263 Underwear 965 Mattress Covers 52 Pieces 427 Total 3713 (29) PUBLIC CONVENIENCES It is considered that there is a great need for a new convenience in the Wandsworth Bridge area and negotiations with the London County Council for a site in this area are proceeding. It is also hoped to obtain permission from the London Transport Executive to build a new convenience in West Cromwell Road, abutting on to West Kensington Station, to replace the Gibbs Green Convenience which is underground, very small and cramped and extremely expensive to maintain. Free Wash Facilities: The 'Free Wash' facilities which have now been in operation for three years, continue to be used and appreciated by the Public, although some still prefer the '3d. wash and brush up' which has remained in operation. The cost of this service, in paper towels and liquid soap, was £100 an increase of £15 over last year's cost duo mainly to the increased cost of materials. PUBLIC HEALTH PROPAGANDA Film Shows: During the year 10 evening film shows have been given at the Central Library on the now familiar lines of health films and, sometimes, talks first, followed by a commercial feature film. The audiences were welcomed and the programmes introduced by a member of the Public Health Committee. The total attendance at these shows was 1,303 persons (average 130) and as the seating capacity is only 150 and a certain in wastage inevitable, these figures are considered very satisfactory. The audiences are always asked for any comments or suggestions but they appear to be completely satisfied with the arrangements in their present form. It is intended to try an 'adults only' show in order to screen some health films unsuitable for young people and also to try and organise shows for particular sections of the community, e.g. food handlers. The co-operation of the Borough Librarian and his staff has contributed greatly to the smooth running of these shows and is much appreciated . (30) LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL - PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES The Maternity and Child Welfare Services since July 1948 are the responsibility of the London County Council. Division I of the London County Council consists of the Metropolitan Boroughs of Chelsea, Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington.

In 5 cases the premises were found not to be in a reasonable state of repair, and certificates were issued. In 1 case the property was outside the scope of the Acts, and in the remaining case the state of the premises did not warrant the issue of a certificate of disrepair. 4 Revocation Certificates were issued to owners during the same period on satisfactory completion of the necessarv repairs. HABITATION CERTIFICATES UNDER SECTION 95(2) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT. 1936. During the year 226 certificates were issued in respect of newly erected and rebuilt premises in the Borough.

HOUSING ESTATES During the year 302 families were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors at the request of the London County Council in connection with applications for alternative accommodation. Of this number 25 cases applied on the grounds of overcrowding and the remaining 277 on medical grounds and the insanitary condition of their living accommodation, 13 families were found to be living in overcrowded conditions, and reports were sent to the Director of Housing and Valuer, London County Council, recommending them for alternative accommodation on the L.C.C.Housing Estates. 61 families were known to have been rehoused during the year. There is close co-operation between the Housing and Public Health Departments on all matters relating to housing. DWELLINGS COMPLETED BY COUNCIL BETWEEN 1st JANUARY and 31st DECEMBER. 1952.

Of these 29 were in connection with additions to existing buildings or the provision of additional sanitary accommodation; 8 were for the reconstruction of existing drainage systems; 7 were in connection with the rebuilding of premises demolished as a result of enemy action, and 12 were for the erection of new buildings. The introduction of the use of the simplified one pipe system of sanitary plumbing in the blocks of flats erected by the Council has so far proved satisfactory, whilst effecting a considerable saving in cost. The use of this system has been watched with great interest by technical officers of many other housing authorities and will continue to be studied closely by officers of this department in collaboration with the technical officers of the department of the Director of Housing and Public Buildings. PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT. 1949. The Council's Rodent Repression Service maintained its campaign against rodents during the year. The number of notifications received by the department, of the existence of rat or mice infestations during the year, totalled 654., a reduction of 149 on the figure for last year. This fact is indicative of a decrease in the number of surface infestations, as it is felt that the public are fully aware of their responsibilities in reporting the presence of rodents. In addition to those premises from which notifications were received, 110 other premises were inspected by the Rodent Operators. Investigation of complaints and visits for subsequent treatment of premises found to be infested necessitated 7,802 visits by the staff. Mice infestations were only slightly more than rat infestations, the figures being 355 and 329 respectively. A total of 52 business premises were treated for infestations, 40 for rats and 12 for mice. During the year a number of defective outlet drains were discovered as a direct result of investigations of rat infestations and these were repaired and the cost of so doing was met by the owners of the premises concerned. In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and with the co-operation of the Borough Surveyor, two treatments of the public sewers were carried out during the year. Comparison of the bait takes during these treatments with the treatments last year indicate that the rat population of the sewers is apparently being held in check. (39) FACTORIES ACT, 1937. Regular inspections of factories, both mechanical and non-mechanical have been carried out and special attention has been paid to new factories, Many firms have improved the sanitary conveniences for men and women and in some cases new accommodation has been provided. Routine observations have been made of emissions from factory chimneys and complaints have been investigated. The co-operation of managements and boiler attendants is appreciated in their efforts to reduce the emissions of smoke. There are factories where work proceeds by day and night with only a wisp of smoke at the top of the chimney. It is now generally understood that where there is smoke there is waste. Coal consumption and costs can be lowered when proper attention is paid to stoking and the introduction of the correct amount of air to burn the gases immediately over the firebed. 'Airborne deposited impurities' continue to be found in the Borough and improvement will occur when every factory reduces the emissions from shafts and provides methods of trapping grit. The use of smokeless fuels in household grates and boilers has done much to reduce the smoke from houses in the borough, especially in the case of new blocks of flats. Noise nuisances have been reported and investigated, often involving late calls at night. Owners and managements have co-operated, often at great expense, to find suitable and adequate methods of reducing noise and vibration from machines. Premises Inspections No. of written notices.

(42) MEASUREMENT AND RECORDING OF ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION It was reported to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee in December, that the London and Home Counties Smoke Abatement Society had suggested that constituent Councils might agree to undertake to an increased extent the work of measurement, recording, etc, of atmospheric pollution. As a result of discussions with the Department of Industrial and Scientific Research, the conclusion had been reached that to do the work adequately would involve the setting up of additional stations in the London area. The Department had much detailed information and suggested that if the Standing Joint Committee agreed in principle to recommend the work to the constituent Councils the Department would be pleased to give advice to individual Councils in the light of their special circumstances. The Standing Joint Committee were advised that the minimum needs for a useful study in the metropolitan area would be 70 measuring and recording stations, that 22 stations were already in use or arranged by the Fuel Research Society, the London County Council or the borough council in 14 boroughs, and that a further 56 stations would be required. The apparatus required is a deposit gauge (similar to a rain gauge for recording pollution by ash or grit) and a lead peroxide instrument for recording the activity of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere in attacking the fabric of buildings (this consists of porcelain cylinders coated with lead peroxide upon which the sulphur dioxide acts). The Standing Joint Committee drew the attention of constituent Councils specially to this matter and invited them (except in the case of Southwark and Stoke Newington Borough Councils, the Westminster City Council and the Corporation of London, in whose areas additional stations were not required) to take such action as they might feel able to provide the necessary stations. Two Atmospheric Pollution Stations were suggested for Fulham and at the time of writing the Council has concurred with this suggestion. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS During 1952, the following samples of filling materials were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to John Hudson, M.A., F.C.S., M.S.Ch.I., of High Wycombe, one of the Prescribed Analysts for the purpose of the Acts:- Rag Flock 5 Hair 1 Coir Fibre 1 Woollen mixture Felt 1 (43) PHARMACY & POISONS ACT. 1933.

No person may keep a pet shop except under the authority of a licence granted in accordance with the provisions of the Act. A licence may be granted by a local authority (in London a Metropolitan Borough) on application from a person not for the time being disqualified from keeping a pet shop and on payment of such fee not exceeding 10/- as the Local Authority shall determine. In deciding whether to grant a licence the Local Authority has particular regard to the need for securing that animals will at all times be kept in suitable accommodation, adequately supplied with suitable food and drink and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals, and that mammals shall not be sold at too early an age; also that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent the spread among animals of infectious diseases and appropriate steps taken in case of fire or other emergency. The Local Authority specifies in the licence such conditions as they think necessary or expedient in each particular case. Any person aggrieved by the refusal of the Local Authority to grant a licence or the conditions imposed in the licence may appeal to a Court of summary jurisdiction and the Court can give directions with respect to the issue of a licence or to the conditions subject to which a licence is to be granted. Any person keeping a pet shop without a licence, or not complying with any of the conditions of a licence is guilty of an offence, as is any person carrying on the business of selling animals as pets in any part of a street or public place except at a stall or barrow in a market and any person selling an animal as a pet to a person whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be under the age of twelve years. Penalties are prescribed for offences under the Act. During 1952, ten licences were issued, appropriate conditions being applied to each licence as conditions warranted. (45) BY-LAWS FOR THE PROTECTION OF FOOD On 3rd November, 1952, by-laws made under Section 15 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, by the London County Council for securing the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practices in connection with the handling, wrapping and delivery of food sold or intended for sale for human consumption, and in connection with the sale or exposure for sale in the open air of food intended for human consumption, came into operation. A copy of the by-laws was delivered to every type of food shop in the Borough. The by-laws apply to food handlers and their clothing, to food premises and to the fixtures, fittings and methods of delivery of food. An example of the detail is that every person who handles, wraps or delivers, or causes to be handled, wrapped or delivered any food shall:- 'Take all such steps as may be reasonably necessary to protect the food from dust, dirt, mud, filth, dirty water, dirty ice, animals, rodents, flies, insects, and other sources of contamination by other persons, and in particular shall cause the food to be so placed as to prevent risk of contamination from such sources.' Another point of interest is that it is now an offence to use any newsprint to wrap food, (other than uncooked vegetables), so that it is in direct contact with the food. Certain by-laws apply to stalls on which food is sold or exposed in the open air and an early opportunity was taken to confer with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor and his staff so that the best possible conditions could be promoted in the street markets of the Borough. (46) FOOD ESTABLISHMENTS Regular inspections were carried out during the year 1952 resulting in 399 requests to the persons responsible requiring the execution of essential work. In no case was it necessary to institute legal proceedings, a tribute to the success of the Council's Food Inspectors in obtaining the co-operation of the traders. Details of the more important improvements which have been effected in food premises during the year are given below:- Water Heaters installed 39 New sinks provided 10 New W.C.'s provided 8 W.C's repaired and cleansed 10 Kitchens, preparation rooms etc. redecorated 129 Floors renewed or repaired 9 Shop fronts repaired or redecorated 27 New dustbins 7 Counter cases for the protection of food 2 New windows 2 Improvements to ventilation 1 Counter refrigerators 1 New chopping blocks 1 Gas stoves repaired or renewed 1 Fishfriers renewed 1 Cold stores reconstructed 2 New refrigerators 3 New counters 1 Yards cleaned and repaired 1 Refuse removed 5 Under the provisions of Section 14 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, premises used for the preparation of certain specified articles of food must be registered with the local authority. At the end of 1952 there were 59 premises on the Register concerned in the preparation of preserved foods and 205 premises on the Register relating to the manufacture or sale and storage of ice cream, as follows:- Premises registered for manufacture, storage and sale of Ice Cream 3 Premises registered for storage and sale of Ice Cream 202 (47) INSPECTIONS OF FOOD PRIMISES Type of Business No. on Register No. of Inspections Contraventions found Premises made fit Bakehouses (Non-Basement) 28 60 13 5 Bakehouses (Basement) 10 31 3 1 Bread and Cake shops 11 55 8 9 Butchers' Shops 73 278 69 27 Confectionery 43 74 - - Cooked Meat Shops 7 28 4 2 Dairies 46) Purveyors of Bottled Milk. ) 74) 441 - - Eel and Pie Shops 5 8 3 - Food Factories 5 38 4 1 Fishmongers' Shops 24 185 26 2 Fried Fish Shops 36 87 19 5 General Food Shops 261 454 73 34 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 117 105 37 12 Horseflesh Butchers 2 6 - - Ice Cream (Manufacturers and Dealers) 205 127 1 1 Licensed Premises 104 68 3 7 Restaurants and Working Class Dining Rooms 156 1,112 116 47 Stalls 90 53 8 8 Stallholders' Storage Premises 35 109 4 - Other Food Premises 29 100 8 1 Totals 1,361 3,419 399 162 (48) INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD Slaughtermen's Licences: The Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, provides that no animal shall be slaughtered in a slaughterhouse or knacker's yard by any person who is not a holder of a licence granted by a local authority. A licence may only be granted to a person aged 18 years or upwards who is, in the opinion of the local authority, a fit and proper person to hold a licence. A licence remains in force for a period up to three years and may be renewed from time to time at the discretion of the local authority. During 1952, two such licences were issued to slaughtermen resident in the Borough of Fulham. There are no slaughterhouses in the Borough. Unsound Food: During 1952, 1,261 Certificates of Condemnation were issued by the Food Inspectors relating to the under-mentioned voluntarily surrendered foods- Meat 3,909½-1bs. Ham 2,128 ,, Sausages 1,923 ,, Fish 144½ stone. Tinned Goods 13,155 Other Goods 6,607 INSPECTION OF BAKEHOUSES AND BAKERS SHOPS At the end of 1952, there were 38 bakehouses in the Borough, 10 of which being 'basement' bakehouses are due in 1954 for special survey during the quinquennial examination prescribed by the Factories Act, 1937. In addition, there were 11 retail bakers' shops without bakehouses attached. During the year under review 146 inspections were made. (49) COMPLAINTS During 1952, 14 complaints (22 in 1951) were received from members of the public regarding foreign matter etc. in food, each of which was fully investigated and reported to the Public Health Committee. The following are details No: Nature of Complaint Action taken on recommendation of Public Health Committee 1 Metal bolt in Australian tin of spinach Referred to Ministry of Food, importers of the spinach. 2 Brown streak in white loaf of bread. No action. Certified by Public Analyst to be brown flour. 3 Wood on bottom of loaf. Bakers warned by letter A Dirty milk bottle. Purveyors warned by letter 5 Brick dust in loaf Bakers warned by letter 6 Loaf wet and dirty Bakers warned by letter 7 "Tizer" possessed flavour of carbolic Manufacturers warned by letter 8 Mouldy meat pie Manufacturers and retailer warned by letter 9 Hair in cake No action. Certified by Public Analyst to be fibre from sack 10 Mouldy cut loaf No action 11 Foreign matter in sausages No action. Certified after laboratory tests to be derived from beef. 12 Slug in bottle of milk Purveyors warned by letter 13 Insect in tinned beans Packers warned by letter 14 Bandage in loaf of bread Bakers warned by letter. (50) "CREAM" CONFECTIONERY During the year under review, eighty-nine samples of "cream"-filled cakes, doughnuts, eclairs, etc., were purchased for bacteriological examination. The fact that the "cream" filling used in this type of confectionery is not subject to any cooking before consumption makes it most important that scrupulous cleanliness be observed by persons handling the cakes. Proper sterilisation of the utensils etc. used for containing the "cream" is also essential. Satisfactory reports were received from the laboratory regarding 87 of the samples, whilst two showed the presence of faecal coli. In both instances the matter was taken up with the bakers concerned, advice on food hygiene given, and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. SALE OF MILK REGULATIONS. 1939. During 1952, 182 samples of milk were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the Council's Public Analyst for chemical analysis. Of these, 96 were purchased from milk vendors in the streets of the Borough during the early delivery, 30 were purchased on Sundays and 42 were taken at the early morning delivery to the hospitals in Fulham. It is satisfactory to record that no adulterations were reported. The following table gives the monthly average composition of all samples of milk and it will be seen that the quality of the milk retailed in Fulham is well maintained and compares very favourably with the legal standards laid down in the Sale of Milk Regulations, 19395:- Month No. of Samples Fat % Solids-not-fat % January 19 3.56 8.73 February 12 3.59 8.75 March 11 3.44 8.64 April 14 3.38 8.61 May 19 3.56 8.70 June 12 3.37 8.77 July 20 3.47 8.70 August 10 3.53 8.74 September 20 3.49 8.72 October 11 3.56 8.80 November 18 3.58 8.80 December 16 3.71 8.73 182 3.50 8.72 Legal Standards 3.00 8.50 Average composition of normal cows' milk 3.76 8.84 (51) The time of year is one of the chief circumstances on which the variations in the composition of cows' milk depends and the year may be divided into four periods according to the character of the milk yielded. Thus, during period I, i.e. November, December and January, milk is rich in fat and solids-not-fat. During the second period, February, March and April, the fat figure falls whilst the solids-not-fat content remains practically the same. At the beginning of the third period, May to August, the fat content is less but tends to rise towards the end of the period; and September and October, the fourth period, sees an increase in both fat and solids-not-fat. It will be seen that Fulham's milk supply appears to follow the normal rise and fall. The arrangement whereby samples of milk are taken either at, or in course of delivery to, the hospitals, institutions, schools, etc., in the Borough was continued during 1952, and the following were taken for chemical analysis:- Institution No. of samples Fulham Hospital 8 Western Fever Hospital 8 L.C.C. Schools 28 Meal Kitchens, etc. 2 Fulham Maternity Home 1 Total 47 REGISTRATION OF PURVEYORS OF MILK The following are details of changes which occurred during the year:- No. of dairymen on Register at 1st January 1952 45 No. of registrations granted during 1952 2 47 No. who transferred their business or discontinued selling milk during 1952 1 Total on Register at 31st December, 1952 46 In addition there were, at the end of 1952, 74 shop-keepers registered to sell milk which was supplied in the properly closed and unopened receptacles in which it was delivered to their premises. During the year 1952, 441 inspections were made to these dairies and milkshops, in addition to visits for the purpose of taking samples. (52) FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. 1938 - 1950. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (PASTEURISED & STERILISED MILK) REGULATIONS. 1949/l950. MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATION) (RAW MILK) REGULATIONS. 1949/1950. Bacteriological Examination of Milk: The tests prescribed for Pasteurised Milk are:- (a) The Phosphatase test for efficient heat-treatment which is satisfied by milk which gives a reading of 2.3 Lovibond blue units or less, and (b) the Methylene blue test for keeping quality which is fied by milk which fails to decolorise Methylene blue in thirty minutes. The Turbidity test is prescribed for Sterilised Milk, the presence of any signs of turbidity indicating that the milk has not been heated to sterilisation temperature. During 1952, 104 samples of milk were purchased by the Sampling Officer and submitted to the appropriate tests. Of these, 24. were taken at the early morning delivery to the hospitals in the Borough and 14 were taken at schools under the control of the London County Council. The following table gives details of these samples:- Grade of Milk No. of Samples tested Phosphatase Test Methylene Test Turbidity Test Passed Failed Passed Failed Passed Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised, 8 8 - 8 - - Pasteurised 90 88 2 89 1 - Sterilised 6 - - - - 6 (53) It will be seen that two samples of pasteurised milk failed to satisfy the phosphatase test for efficient heat-treatment and one failed to satisfy the Methylene blue test for keeping quality. These cases were reported to the Milk Division of the Ministry of Food to whom a monthly return is submitted of the samples taken in the Borough together with the result of the appropriate examinations. The milk now retailed in Fulham is either the product of "tuberculin tested" herds or has been "pasteurised" or "sterilised" in accordance with the provisions of the above Regulations. The use of these special designations is only permissible by persons duly licensed by the local authority. Licences issued under these Regulations are renewable annually on the 1st January, principal licences being granted to retailers occupying premises within the Borough, whilst supplementary licences are issued to purveyors who distribute milk in Fulham from premises situated outside. The following are details of licences granted for the year 1952:- No. of licences to retail Tuberculin Tested milk 79 No, of Supplementary Licences to retail Tuberculin Tested milk 10 No. of licences to pasteurise milk 1 No. of licences to retail pasteurised milk 85 No, of supplementary licences to retail pasteurised milk 10 No. of licences to retail sterilised milk 109 No, of Supplementary Licences to retail sterilised milk 10 (54) ICE CREAM (HEAT TREATMENT) REGULATIONS. 1947 - 1951. These Regulations control the preparation and subsequent treatment of ice cream. Ice Cream must be kept at a temperature of not more than 28° F., and should the temperature rise above 28° F. the ice cream must be subject to further heat treatment and again kept at a temperature not exceeding 28° F. The Methylene blue test is recommended as a guide for ascertaining the bacterial cleanliness of ice cream, the time taken to decolorise Methylene blue being recorded and the samples graded as follows Grade 1 Decolorised in 4½ hours or more. " 2 Decolorised in 2½ - 4 hours. " 3 Decolorised in ½ - 2 hours. " 4 Decolorised in less than ½ hour. During 1952,83 samples of ice cream were examined and graded as follows:- Grade Wrapped Taken from Bulk Total 1 42 22 64 2 3 7 10 3 2 2 4 4 - 5 5 Totals 47 36 83 In addition to the above, 23 ice lollies were examined, all of which satisfied Grade 1. Samples falling within Grade 1 and 2 are regarded as satisfactory, whilst Grades 3 and 4 indicate carelessness in hygiene at some stage in the manufacture, handling or storage of the ice cream. It is the practice in Fulham to investigate when samples fall within the latter grades. (55) THE FOOD STANDARDS (ICE CREAM) ORDER, 1951. Under this order, which came into operation on 1st March, 1951, ice cream (but not water ices or ice lollies) must contain not less than 5% fat 10% sugar and milk solids other than fat, 7½%. The standards do not apply to ice cream which contains a high percentage of fruit, fruit pulp or fruit puree or to "Kosher" ices. Owing to a shortage, milk powder and fats could not be allocated to ice cream manufacturers at the same rate as in 1951 and in order to avoid reduction in the supply of ice cream, the Minister of Foal found it necessary to modify the standard for ice cream which was introduced in March 1951 and is detailed above. It was therefore decided to reduce the minimum fat content from 5% to 4% and the minimum non-fat milk solids content from 7½% to 5%, and these revised standards were laid down in:- THE FOOD STANDARS (ICE CREAM) (AMENDMENT) ORDER 1952. which became operative on 7th July, 1952. During the year under review 35 samples or ice cream were purchased for chemical analysis by the Public Analyst and a summary of results is given below:- Percentage of Fat No. of Samples Less than 5%1 1 5% - 7½% 8 7½% - 10 19 Over 10% 7 Total 35 The average composition of all samples was 8.5% fat. (56) FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. 1938 - 1950. During the year under review 800 samples of food and drugs purchased by the Sampling Officer were submitted to the Council's Public Analyst for chemical analysis. The samples, which are taken under the various Acts, Orders and Regulations relating to foodstuffs, are divided into two classes, viz:- (a) formal samples, or those in the purchase of which the legal procedure laid down in the Food and Drugs Act 1938, relating to declaration of identity, division into three parts, sealing etc. of the sample is carried out. In these cases legal proceedings can be instituted when the. samples are certified to be adulterated. 765 samples were taken formally, (b) Informal samples, which are samples purchased without carrying out the legal formalities and merely serve to indicate the conditions obtaining without disclosing to the vendor the object of the purchase. 34 samples were taken informally. One sample was submitted by a private individual. Adverse reports were received from the Public Analyst on 44 of the samples examined, none of which justified the institution of legal proceedings . The following are details of the 44 articles which were reported to be not in accordance with accepted standards and the action taken:- Sample No: Article Result of Analysis Action taken 34 Ground Almonds Contained free fatty acids calculated as oleic acid 18.1% Matter brought to notice of packers and wholesalers. 50 Semolina Too fine. 78.5% passed 40 mesh sieve.

During the year 1952, 800 samples of foods and drugs were extrained. Of these 34 were taken informally, 765 formally, and one by a private person. The number adulterated or incorrectly labelled was 44, or 5.5%. The incidence of adulteration may be classified as follows:- Article No. of Samples examined No. of Samples adulterated. Milk 182 - Other Foods 608 44 Drugs 10 — A sample of Pork Sausages was examined and found to be 20% deficient in meat. 2 Table Jellies failed to comply with the setting test proscribed by the Food Standards (Table Jellies) Order, 1949, and another sample possessed an unpleasant taste due to a thin film on the outside of the jelly caused by rancid oil which was probably used to grease the moulds when the jellies were made. Some Tea Tablets were examined, and your analyst was of the opinion that the essential effect of the Tablets was that the sodium bicarbonate darkens the colour of the tea infusion creating the impression that the tea is stronger than it is. The label also failed to comply with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order, 1950. a formal sample of these tablets was obtained, but in the meantime another Authority for whom your analyst was acting as Public Analyst had taken up the matter of their composition and labelling with the manufacturers and whilst the matter was under discussion the control of tea was withdrawn and so the excuse for any tablets of this type ceased to exist. Three samples of Cut Peel were found to be unsatisfactory. One sample contained only 43.3% of total sugars and another sample contained 49%. The third sample contained 56% of sugar, but was fermenting rather badly. A sample of Mincemeat had an acid flavour and contained an amount of acid equivalent to 0.65% calculated as acetic acid. The Preserves Order, S.I. 1949 No. 1893, requires that mincemeat shall contain not more than (62) 0.5 parts of acetic acid in 100 parts of mincemeat. Another sample also possessed a very acid odour and taste but contained 0.6% of acid calculated as acetic acid. Your analyst considers that when the full legal quantity of acetic acid is added to a mix which is already acid for other reasons it forms a product which tends to be unsatisfactory. 2 Samples of Figs were reported as inferior as they were rather badly attacked by acaries, and although these were mostly dead and in any case would be killed in cooking, the white matter on the figs was really excretory matter from the mites. This white deposit is generally considered by laymen to be due to the crystallisation of sugar. Some Dates were found to be dirty, but no grit could be separated and they were reported as inferior. 6 Samples of Prunes possessed a creosote smoky flavour. One sample was dirty and the plums had evidently fermented before drying. Another sample was mouldy and sugar had later crystallised on the outside. These prunes would not cook satisfactorily. 4 Samples of Semolina were considered to be too fine as more than 40% passed a 40 mesh sieve. 3 Samples of Flake Tapioca, one received as a complaint, were so uneven in size that they could not be cooked properly, and one of Seed Tapioca Substitute was infested with maggots. A sample of Coconut in Syrup contained only 17.5% of sugar. As coconut contains about 4% of sugar your analyst was of the opinion that the product should have been described as "Coconut in weak Syrup" and not as "Coconut in Syrup" which denotes something which is really syrupy. A packet of Ground Almonds contained 18.1% of free fatty acids calculated as oleic acid and was reported as being unsuitable for sale for human consumption. This sample was, however, old stock. 2 Samples of White Popper were found to contain an excessive number of polygonal cells due to seed coat and should not properly have been called white pepper. A sample of Dripping was reported as inferior because it possessed an objectionable odour and taste although the rancidity was insufficient to show a positive test by chemical methods. The sample had probably been improperly refined. Samples of mixed pickles, date pudding, stewed steak and butter, were all examined because of complaints by members of the public, but were found to be genuine in each case. (63) A complaint was received about some sterilised milk which was very brown and badly caramelised. This was due either to overheating of the milk during sterilisation or the milk being slightly sour before sterilisation, 2 samples of Chocolate Confectionery Powder contained skimmed milk powder and defatted cocoamass but no chocolate powder was present. There was no declaration of the presence of skimmed milk powder and the ingredients were not declared in the correct order. 2 Sherbet Powders contained starch, but starch was not declared on the label, nor may it be a component of sherbet; the samples, therefore, contravened the Food and Drugs Act and Labelling of Food Order. A Soft Drink Powder with bubblegum contained 58.% of maize starch and the bubblegum was largely paraffin wax. It was labelled as a soft drink powder and therefore starch must not be usod. 2 Samples of Butter Crunch were examined and found to contain not more than 25 parts of butter in 100 parts of fat. lour analyst was of the opinion that an article described as Butter Crunch must contain only butter as the fat which had been used in its manufacture and this view is in accordance with a press notice issued by the Minister of Food. Some Dolly Mixture confectionery was reported inferior as it contained only 39% of sugar and an appreciable amount of starch. As it was sold off the ration at a cheap price the matter was not really of great importance from the standpoint of the Food and Drugs Act. During the year several items of legislation or recommendations of Committees of the Ministry of Food were issued, which are of general interest to the public from the point of view of quality. No less than three separate Meat Products Orders were introduced. These orders wero of particular interest, in that they were issued primarily as enforcement orders and not as standards under the Food and Drugs Act. For this reason Local Authorities and public analysts were not informed either in advance or at the time of their issue by the Minister, but it is probable that it is the standards, rather than the prices, which will eventually be resurrected from their ashes, even the last order having been revoked in 1953. The first order, S.I. 1952, No. 507, removed the restriction on the use of soya flour in sausages, but permitted the inclusion of not more than 6% of skim milk powder in such products, the milk powder to count as 60% of its weight of meat. For the first time minimum quantities were laid down for the meat content of many meat products. As a result of this order the general methods for the analysis of these meat products were reviewed in detail by public analysts and manufacturers. (64) Later in the year this order was replaced by the Meat Products (No.2) Order, 1952, From the public health standpoint the chief amendments introduced were the removal of the permission to use milk pov/der or fat of vegetable origin in place of part of the meat and to include tinned soups as meat products. Owing to various difficulties in applying this order a third order was introduced at the end of the year revoking all standards other than those for sausages. To the layman it may appear that there has been a considerable amount of wasted legislation, much of which has caused considerable discussion and argument. There appears little doubt, however, that whilst numerous standards put forward and eventually withdrawn had been issued without sufficient consultation with all interested parties, many members of the trade and analysts will employ these standards as a basis for commercial and other purposes, and that they may again be issued at some future date when we have more knowledge regarding their application. The Food Standards (Fish Paste) Order, 1951, which came into effect for retail sales on 7th March requires fish paste to contain not less than 70% of fish after all waste has been eliminated. Fish varies considerably in composition and public analysts are endeavouring to discover methods of analysis which can be used for its enforcement. The Food Standards (Meat Paste) Order, 1951, came into effect for retail sales on 7th March. This order fixes a standard of not less than 55% of meat in meat paste. The Milk (Control and Maximum Prices) (Great Britain) (Amendment No.4.) Order, 1951, which came into effect on the 1st January, 1952, included both Jersey and Guernsey milk as Channel Island milk. The Food Standards (Coffee Mixtures) Order, 1952, requires coffee and chicory mixtures, including French coffee, to be mixtures of coffee and chicory only and to contain at least 51% of coffee. It further requires coffee with fig flavour or fig seasoning, including Viennese coffee to be a mixture of coffee with figs only and to contain at least 35% of coffee. This is the first time that there has been any standard for coffee and fig mixtures in this country. The Food Standards (Edible Gelatine) Order, 1951, which came into force on the 1st February, 1952, requires a 3% solution of gelatine, unless labelled otherid.se, to form a jelly at 60° F., to contain not more than 3.25% of ash, and not more than specified traces of arsenic, lead, copper or zinc. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) (Amendment,) Order, 1952, reduced the minimum fat content of ice-cream from 5% to 4% and milk solids other than fat to 5%. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951, had required ice (65) cream to contain not less then 5% of fat and 7.5% of milk solids other than fat. Previous to the last war reputable manufacturers included about 12% of milk fat in ice croaa. The Food Standards (Suet) Order, 1952, requires block suet to contain not less than 99% by weight of beef suet. It also requires shredded suet to be free from fibrous tissue and to contain not less than 33% of beef fat, the permitted diluent being farinaceous material. The Oils and Fats Order, 1952, although re-issued as a fresh order, introduced no fresh standards for oils end fats. Lead in Foods. At the end of 1951 the Ministry of Food circulated a Report and Recommendations designed to limit the amount of lead in various foods and comment was invited from interested people. The proposals put forward were generally those which were expected, but one of the chief obstacles in the way of promulgation of fined, standards at the present time is the difficulty of finding satisfactory methods for the exact determination of minute quantities of this element. The maximum amounts of lead suggested vary from 0.2 parts per million in ready-todrink beverages other than beer and cider to 20 parts in colourings or 10 parts in herbs, spices, flavourings and liquid pectin. Jam and Marmalade. Revised standards ware suggested by the Food Standards Committee for certain jams; although these are still left as short term standards and may be revised when conditions improve. The fruit content for full-fruit standard jams is generally still below the pre-war full fruit standard of the Food Manufacturers' Federation, but is an improvement on the standards adopted in the Food Standards (Preserves) Order, 1944, in the case of blackcurrant, loganberry, and raspberry jams, the quantities of fruit being increased from 22%, 25% and 25% to 30% in each case. The minimum percentage of fruit in damson jam is, however, reduced from 3o£ to 35%. Llnueur Chocolates. During the year the Ministry of Food consulted the home trade regarding the use of the terra "liqueur chocolates" as a description for chocolate confectionery containing liquid centres, which contained non-spirituous flavoured syrup. It was arranged that the words "imitation liqueur chocolates" followed immediately by the word "non-alcoholic" would be used for the description of this confectionery in the future and that the word "non-alcoholic" should be in substantially the same sine type as the other descriptive words. The Minister also drew attention to the fact that the mahority of these products are imported from abroad and that he had been unable to hold discussions with the manufacturers. Since very few confectioners hold licences for the sale of alcoholic liquors it is illegal for them to sell real liqueur chocolates. (66) During the year the Minister of Food withdrew the Labelling of Food Advisory Service which had been operating very successfully for some years. Whilst this service had no legislative power it provided a most useful liaison between food manufacturers and packers on the one hand and Local Authorities on the other. Any manufacturer seeking advice was given the benefit of the experience of the legal and chemical advisers of the Minister and most manufacturers having been given this advice, accepted it loyally, From the point of view of the public analyst the service was invaluable because, whenever he was in doubt regarding the description or labelling of any product he had only to contact the Ministry to know whether the matter had received the approval of the Ministry and, if so, whether the Ministry had been informed correctly of the composition of the food. With the disappearance of this service every public analyst will be obliged to express his own opinion regarding the labelling of a product and its composition in regard to such label. In the event of the Local Authority supporting the public analyst it will have to be decided whether the matter is one which should be discussed amicably with the manufacturer, or whether legal action should be taken. It is thus seen that the advice and opinion of one central advisory service is being replaced by some three hundred and fifty critics, who will not necessarily all be of the same opinion. The increase in eventual cost will be enormous and cannot but cause irritation to reputable manufacturers.
