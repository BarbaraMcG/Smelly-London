STOL5 THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. OLAVE DISTRICT. Annual Report OF THE Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the District. FOR THE YEAR 1897. BY WILLIAM ARTHUR BOND, M.A., M.D., B.C., D.P.H. (Camb.), M.R.C.P. (Lond.) Fellow of the Society of Medical Officers of Health; Fellow and Member of the Council of the British Institute of Public Health; Member and Demonstrator of the Sanitary Institute; Member of the Epidemiological Society, etc. Medical Officer of Health to the Board of Works for the Holborn District; and Medical Officer of Health for the District. LONDON: PRINTED BY C. TALBOT, TOOLEY STREET, S.E. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, For the Year 1897. To the Members of the Board of Works for the St. Olave District , Southwark. Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you ray fourth Annual Report. This Report, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, deals with the twelve months ending December 31st, 1897. The details of the Report show that much work has been done in improving the Sanitary condition of the District. A large amount of house-to-house inspections have been effected during the year, and the Sanitary defects found have been remedied. A systematic inspection of the Sanitary arrangements of the Wharves has been commenced, and the necessary notices served. The registration and regulation of houses let in lodgings has also been begun. During the year, twelve houses have been registered. In December, six other houses were ordered by the Board to be registered; but the registration was not completed till this year. 4 In many other houses, although not registered, the rooms have been measured and the results recorded. Although this year there is a reduction in the general death-rate, this rate, and also that from phthisis, continue to be higher than the rates for London. Statistics of the London districts have shown that these rates increase with an increase of conditions that are associated with, and expressed by the word, " overcrowding." Continued efforts have been made to abate this recurring: nuisance. Last year, 79 cases of overcrowding were dealt with. Many rooms were again found to be in a filthy and disgraceful state on account of the neglect of the occupiers. In 85 such cases, notices were served on the tenants with very beneficial results. The Metropolitan Asylums Board has again been unable to receive all the cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria that required to be removed to their hospitals, notwithstanding the continued efforts of the Managers to keep pace with the growing demands of the Metropolis. The treatment of diphtheria by anti-toxic sernm still continues to give very satisfactory results. The Board consented to continue to pay the expenses of bacteriological examination of material from doubtful cases of diphtheria at the Laboratory of Guy's Hospital. Only two such cases were examined last year. These do not 5 include doubtful cases belonging to this District that attended Guy's Hospital, where a bacteriological examination of material from all doubtful cases is made. Permission was also given for medical practitioners to have the opportunity of an examination made at Guy's Hospital of a few drops of blood from doubtful cases of typhoid fever. One such case was by this means considered not to be typhoid fever. The Mortuary has been thoroughly repaired and painted. A satisfactory site for a new Mortuary has not yet been found. The sanitary bedding trucks have been repaired, and better accommodation for them provided at the Board's Wharf. A new public urinal has been erected in Joiner Street on the site of the old one, which was frequently a source of nuisance. Several other urinals have had or are having the Board's attention. The Committee appointed by the Home Secretary to make inquiry into and report on the conditions of work as they affect the health of the operatives in the industries in which anthrax is alleged to occur, issued its report last year. As there is a very large trade in this District in hides and skins, I may say that the Committee recommend that the processes of unpacking, sorting, and packing, and all the incidental handling previous to immersion in lime pits, of Russian, Chinese, and dry East Indian hides and skins (and 6 others which from time to time it may be found necessary to add to the list) should be certified as dangerous under Sec. 8 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1891, and that special rules should he issued for the protection of those employed in such processes. The reasons for this, and the special rules suggested, are given. It is also suggested that power should be given to the Board of Trade, or some other Government Department, to prohibit the landing of hides on duly accredited information that they come from infected areas. The following Acts affecting the Metropolis were passed during the year:— The Metropolis Water Act, 1897. The Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. The Infant Life Protection Act, 1897. By the first, any water consumer or Local Authority (who may also aid a water consumer) may complain to the Railway and Canal Commission in respect of the quantity or quality of water supplied, or the charges made by a Water Company. By the second Act, any Local Authority has the power to make provision for cleansing any person and his clothing from vermin. The St. Marylebone Vestry has carried out a very successful experiment. In twenty-five days 148 persons attended at the premises provided, bathed, and had their clothes disinfected by super-heated steam. A bath might easily be provided for this purpose in one of the three cottages forming the Board's "Shelter," and clothes disinfected in the steam apparatus. 7 This bath, moreover, would be a useful and desirable adjunct to the ordinary purposes of the shelter. The Board last year gave its permission for bedding and clothing infected with vermin at the Common Lodging Houses to be disinfected in the Board's steam apparatus; also for such bedding and clothing in any tenement in the District, provided the tenement was also thoroughly cleansed. By the third Act, any person retaining or receiving for hire or reward more than one infant under the age of five years for the purpose of maintenance, must give notice thereof to the Local Authority. Such infants may not be kept in insanitary or overcrowded dwellings, and must be properly attended. In case of death of such an infant, notice must be given to the coroner of the district. The London County Council is the Local Authority for London. The Act could probably have been more efficiently administered in London by the sanitary authorities. As the Vaccination Bill, now before the House of Commons, is very unsatisfactory, I may mention some points that have been urged at meetings and a conference of Public Health Societies: (1). That the age limit within which a child should be vaccinated after birth should be six months, as in Scotland; (2). That evidence of efficient vaccination should be afforded on admission of a child to a public elementary school; 8 (3). That it is essential that the Act should contain a definition of efficient vaccination; (4). That it is essential that the State should take steps to require the re-vaccination of all persons on their attaining the age of twelve years; (5). That the powers and duties with regard to tion should be transferred from the Poor Law to the Sanitary Authorities; and (6). That the Government should pay for vaccination performed by general medical practitioners, subject to the vaccination being done in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, and being open to inspection. I thank the Members and Officers of the Board for all the kindness, courtesy, and co-operation that I have received. I desire especially to acknowledge the excellent and cordial co-operation afforded by your Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Thomas Ashdown. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. A. BOND. 9 VITAL STATISTICS. Population, etc.—The populations of the several parishes of the District at the censuses of 1881, 1891 and 1896 were— 1881. 1891. 1896. Area in acres. St. Olave 2,247 2,159 2,314 48 St. Thomas 781 752 8 St. John, Horselydown 8,928 9,812 9,417 69 11,956 12,723 11,731 125 The density of population in 1896 was 94 persons per acre; for Registration London it was 59 to an acre. I have based the calculations in the following Reports upon the population of all ages as usually estimated to the middle of the year 1897. This is 11,495. Allowance is also made in the calculations for the fact that the Registrar's Returns include exactly 52 weeks. BIRTHS. The number of births registered for the whole District (which includes the united Parish of St. Olave and St. Thomas and that of St. John), for the 52 weeks ending January 1st, 1898, was 434. Of this total, 234 were male children and 200 female children. This gives a birth-rate of 37.9 per thousand of the population. The birth-rates for the five preceding years were 35.9, 32.9, 33.2, 32, 36.2, and the birth-rate for Registration London for the year was 30.0, the lowest London birthrate recorded. 10 DEATHS. The deaths registered in the 52 weeks ending 1st January, 1898, as having occurred in the District were 808; 599 of these took place at Guy's Hospital, this number including only 21 deaths of parishioners, 578 belonging to other Districts. At the Parish Street Workhouse there were 42 deaths, only one of these belonging to the District. Twelve bodies were found in the Thames, all non-parishioners. Two non-parisliioners died in the District. The deaths of 64 parishioners were returned from outlying public institutions. Thus the number of deaths of persons belonging to the District was 239. The corrected annual death-rate was 20.9 per thousand. The corresponding death-rate for London for the year was 17.7. The corrected death-rate of St. Olave's and of London for the past seven years are as under— Year. St. Olave's Death-Rate per 1,000 London Death-Rate per 1,000 1891 25.2 21.4 1892 23.7 20.4 1893 21.2 21.3 1894 19.4 17.4 1895 23.1 19.4 1896 21.7 18.2 1897 20.9 17.7 11 The population for the years 1891—95 inclusive, estimated in the usual way was probably too high, as the census of 1896 showed that the population had diminished. The death-rates therefore as given for these years are probably lower than the true death-rates. The marked reduction in the death-rate this year is very satisfactory. The detailed causes of death will be found in the various tables accompanying this Report. Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of young children always bear a high ratio to total deaths. There were 98 deaths of children under 5 years old, that is 41 0 per cent, of the total deaths ; last year it was -18'6 per cent. 63 children died under one year old; that is only 145 per 1,000 births registered. The corresponding rate for London was 158 per thousand. This proportion has very much diminished in this District the past three years; for in 1895 it was as high as 205 per 1,000 births. Phthisis and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. There were 32 deaths of persons belonging to this District caused by phthisis, or an annual rate of 2.79 per 1,000 inhabitants; the corresponding rate for London was 1.71 per 1,000. 52 deaths were caused by other diseases of the respiratory organs, namely, pneumonia, bronchitis and pleurisy. 12 Zymotic Diseases. The number of deaths from the seven principal Zymotic Diseases was less than half that of the preceding year. The following Table gives a comparison of the two years:— 1896. 1897. Small-pox — - Measles 15 6 Scarlet Fever 5 2 Diphtheria 9 2 Whooping Cough 13 8 Fever (Typhoid, &c.) 1 1 Diarrhoea, Dysentery, and Cholera 11 7 Totals 54 26 The deaths of Londoners from these Diseases were:— 1896. 1897. 1897. 1st Qr. 2nd Qr. 3rd Qr. 4th Qr. Small-pox 9 16 12 2 2 0 Measles 3,697 1,928 162 298 302 1,166 Scarlet Fever 942 781 166 151 216 248 Diphtheria 2,683 2,262 641 428 488 705 Whooping Cough 2,937 1,841 543 471 373 454 Fever 609 593 127 85 11 237 Diarrhœa 3,223 4,104 179 195 3,510 220 Total 14,100 11,525 1,8:30 1,630 5,035 3,030 13 Notification or Infectious Diseases. In District. Guy's Hospital Staff. Workhouse. Totals. 1896. 1897. 1896. 1897. 1896. 1897. 1896. 1897. Small-pox 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 Scarlet Fever 49 65 4 10 6 12 59 87 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 33 26 4 2 0 1 37 29 Typhoid 6 10 1 1 2 0 9 11 Erysipelas 20 10 0 0 1 0 21 10 Totals 108 111 9 14 9 13 126 138 It is thus seen that the slight increase is due almost wholly to an increased prevalence of Scarlet Fever. The cases at the Workhouse did not belong to this District. The cases of Infectious Disease have been about the same as for London as a whole, per 1000 inhabitants. In London the notifications were:— 1896. 1897. Small-pox 225 105 Scarlet Fever 25,647 22,876 Diphtheria 13,362 12,811 Membranous Croup 446 388 Enteric Fever 3,190 3,113 Typhus Fever 6 4 Continued Fevers 106 68 Puerperal Fever 277 264 Erysipelas 6,436 5,801 Cholera 13 38 Totals 49,708 45,468 The "corrected" Return for 1897 has not yet been received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 14 Small-pox.—The only case of small-pox notified was that of a House-Surgeon at Guy's Hospital, who recovered. In London there were 101 notifications, and 16 deaths. The statistics of all epidemics of small pox show the enormous value of vaccination and re-vaccination. Notwithstanding this the proportion of children that are not vaccinated has been increasing year by year since 1881, both in the Metropolis and the rest of England. In 1881 the proportion of children unaccounted for in regard to vaccination (including cases postponed) in the Metropolitan Unions was only 5.7 per cent, of the total births. In 1891 this proportion had risen to 16.4 per cent., and is still rising. See introduction, pages 7-8, re the Vaccination Bill now before the House of Commons. Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina.— There were 87 cases notified, and only 2 deaths; 84 of the 87 cases were removed to hospital. In London the notifications were 22,876 in number, and the deaths from the complications of this disease were 778, the smallest number of deaths in London from this disease since 1891, and much below the average of the preceding ten years. During July, September and October, the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board were very full, so that it was often impossible to have patients suffering from scarlet fever or diphtheria promptly removed to hospital; in some cases there was a delay of many days, notwithstanding daily application to Norfolk House. 15 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup.—29 cases were notified, and all but two were removed to hospital; one, a child who died before it could be removed, and a youth who went to Waterloo Station in a cab; his destination could not be ascertained. There were only two deaths, a case mortality of only 6.8 per cent., that of London being 17.5 per cent. In London there were 12,811 cases notified, and 2,240 deaths from this disease, the smallest number since 1892. Typhoid Fever.—There were 11 notifications, and one death. One of these was probably not a case of Typhoid as Widal's reaction could not be obtained. Another was a nurse who had been in attendance on a case of typhoid, fever at Guy's Hospital. Four cases were probably not contracted in this District, one of which was apparently caused by the consumption of infected oysters while at Southend. In London there were 3,113 notifications and 557 deaths. Measles. The mortality from measles in this District, although small in comparison with that of last year—namely, 6 to 15 —it caused three times as many deaths as scarlet fever or diphtheria. In London there are generally four or five consecutive quarters of years with few deaths, followed by three or four consecutive quarters in which the number of deaths is very large. Last year it was not till the last quarter that the number of deaths from measles in London assumed epidemic 16 proportions; the numbers in the four successive quarters having been 168, 208, 302, and 1,167 respectively, and were as many as 1,494 in the first quarter of the present year. In the ten years, 1887—1896, the registered number of deaths in London was from Measles 27,426 Scarlet Fever 10,392 Diphtheria 19,672 Moreover, the assigned number of deaths from measles is less than the real number; for instance, in 1896 the assigned number in this District was 11, whereas the real number was at least 15. The cause of death registered is often that of a complication of the disease, such as broncho-pneumonia; no mention being made of the primary cause. The large number of deaths from this disease means an enormous amount of sickness which sometimes causes injury for life in those that survive; moreover the latter are rendered more prone to be attacked by other diseases, such as diphtheria, whooping cough, scarlet fever, diarrhœa, and consumption. You are aware that I have recommended that notification of measles by the head of the family should be compulsory, and that children from infected houses should not be allowed to attend school. People ought to be taught that they owe this duty to their neighbours and society generally. It certainly ought not to be legal for any person by wilful neglect and carelessness to cause disease and death. 17 Disinfection, &c. The measures taken in dealing with the cases arising in the District outside Guy's Hospital were as follows:— Number of rooms fumigated 118 Do. cabs do. 1 Number of rooms stripped and cleansed by Owner or Occupier 94 Do. do. by the Board 5 Number of notices served, calling the attention of Occupiers of houses to the provisions of Sections 62 and 65 P.H. (London) Act, 1891 164 Number of notices requiring disinfection 64 Number of articles of bedding, clothing, &c., disinfected 4,750 Number of articles given up and destroyed (exclusive of books) 63 Number of persons using Shelter 66 Number of notices sent to Schools notifying where houses are infected 121 Number of copies of certificates made and forwarded to the M.A.B. or other Districts 150 The premises where infectious diseases occurred were all inspected and examined, and notices served when necessary. The Shelter provided for temporary occupation by families during the disinfection of their rooms has been used 20 times during the year, by 66 persons, 64 of whom were also provided with sleeping accommodation. During the year notices on printed forms have been sent to the Head Teachers of Schools, informing them of the disinfection of houses in which any of their scholars are inmates, so that the children can return to School with as little delay as desirable. 18 Anthrax, or Malignant Pustule. Through the courtesy of Dr. Perry I have received information of 8 cases of Anthrax admitted to Guy's Hospital last year. One of them was afterwards considered either a very mild or a doubtful case. All but one recovered after operation. The previous year all 14 cases recovered. Five of the 8, including the doubtful case, were employed in this District. In the introduction, page 5, I give some extracts from the Report of the Committee appointed by the Home Secretary. Collection of House Refuse. This important service continues to be carried out regularly and efficiently, as for the fourth year in succession not a single complaint of neglect or inattention has been received. On the contrary, 612 visits have been made to houses where the dustmen have reported failure to obtain the refuse at the appointed times; and in 44 cases, where the occupiers have refused the dustmen's request to permit the removals, notices have been served, but no further proceedings were necessary. 67 new sanitary dust-pails have been provided in the place of old brick or wooden dust-bins. These much facilitate the work of the dustmen, and reduce to a minimum the nuisance caused by the storage and removal of house refuse. Two ancient public dust-bins have been demolished during the year. Inquests. 155 inquests were held in this District; only 14, however, were on the bodies of parishioners. 132 of these inquests were held in the Coroner's Court at Guy's Hospital, and 23 in the St. John's Vestry Hall. 19 Mortuary. 32 bodies were removed to the Mortuary in Weaver's Lane, and on 23 of these a Coroner's inquest was held in the St. John's Yestry Hall, Fair Street. 12 were bodies of nonparishioners that were found in the Thames. The Mortuary has been thoroughly repaired and painted. A satisfactory site for a new Mortuary has not yet been found. Temperature. The mean temperature of the year was 50°.3 F., being 1°.6 above the average of the preceding 125 years. The rainfall was 22.13 inches, and was 2.83 inches below the average of the preceding 82 years. Rain fell on 169 days during the year. Further meteorological details are given in the Appendix. SANITARY WORK. Houses Closed under the Public Health (London) Act of 1891. The Horseshoe and Wheatsheaf p.h., Melior Street, closed by Magistrate's order. It was demolished, and is now nearly re-built. Nos. 54, 55, 56, 57, & 58 Queen Elizabeth Street, were closed by the owners, instead of complying with notices to remedy sanitary defects. They have also been demolished. Nos. 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, & 20 Lafone Street, closed and demolished by owners, after notices had been served to remedy the sanitary defects of some of them. Treasurer of Guy's Hospital—stables and coachman's dwelling, closed after notice. 20 Houses Demolished, Re-built, &c. Nos. 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, & 43a Lafone Street, re-built, and now occupied as 21 tenements. King's Arms p.h., 251 Tooley Street, demolished and nearly rebuilt. House and Shop 249 ,, „ Southwark Arms p.h., 128 ,, ,, King of Prussia p.h., 186 ,, ,, House next door 188 „ ,, Nos. 40 & 41 Parish Street have been demolished, and included in the new King of Prussia p.h. Shuter's Cooperage, 283 Tooley Street, has been demolished for the site of the new Guardians' Offices, which are being built. The new Institute is being erected on the site of Thompson's Engineering Works and the dwellinghouses 2, 3, & 4 Fair Street, which were demolished. No. 2 Maze Pond has been re-built on account of damage by fire. Nos. 29 & 31 Maze Pond. A large dwelling house which had been closed for years was demolished, and a new warehouse is being erected. Hanover Buildings, Nos. 168 to 191 inclusive, have been demolished for the Tower Bridge Southern Approach ; and Nos. 51, 53, & 55 Artillery Street closed for the same purpose. At the Workhouse, Parish Street, a new wash house has been built. 21 House-to-House Inspections. The following house-to-house inspections have been made during the year, and all sanitary defects found have been remedied:— Artillery Street 31 houses. Artillery Lane 8 ,, Barnham Street 27 „ Bermondsey Place 7 ,, Bethel Place 15 ,, Brewers Turning 10 ,, Brewers Turning 4 ,, English Grounds 18 ,, Firbeck Cottages 7 ,, Gibbons Rents 6 ,, Goat Street 4 ,, Heaths Rents 4 ,, Jacques Buildings 3 ,, Lafone Street 32 „ Landrail Place 16 „ Matilda Place 6 ,, Maze Pond (part) 22 „ Maze Yard 3 ,, Sarnells Court 5 „ Smiths Buildings 8 „ Sparricks Row 13 „ Registered Houses. The following houses let in lodgings have been registered during the year:— Maze Pond, Nos. 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 & 18; Lafone Street, Nos. 8 & 31; Gainsford Street, No. 60; Curlew Street, No. 1; Morris Court, Nos, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 & 12. The registration of the last six was not completed till this year. 22 Bakehouses. The Bakehouses of the District have been twice inspected during the year. The one at 61 Gainsford Street has been demolished. Three notices were served on the occupiers to comply with the Board's regulations. Five of the seven Bakehouses are situated below the ground level. A detailed account of the sanitary work done will be found in Table III. (of the Appendix), prepared by the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Thomas Ashdown. All the work has been satisfactorily carried out. Foods Unfit for Human Consumption. The undermentioned were given up by the respective owners, and destroyed, the same being found unfit for the food of man:— Tons Cwts. qrs. lbs. Cheese (2 lots) 2 19 l 2 Eggs (3 lots) - 12 - - Tinned Meat (5 lots - 4 2 17 Fish (2 lots) - - 2 20 Tinned Pineapple - 2 - - Geese and Turkeys - 4 3 - Partridges - 3 - 26 Pickled Brisket of Beef - 2 2 20 Pickled Tongues - 1 3 4 Rabbits (2 lots) - 12 3 16 Total 5 4 0 3 Sale of Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. A summary of the samples that have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst, and the proceedings taken, will be found in Table IV. 23 WATER SUPPLY. During the year the average daily supply of the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company was 33,753,671 gallons. Of this an average daily supply of about 1,500,000 gallons was derived from the Company's well at Streatham: thus the average dailv amount drawn from the Thames was more than 32,000,000 gallons. By the agreement with the Conservators, the Company was allowed to take not more than 24,500,000 gallons daily. So that last year the Company was taking an average of more than 7,500,000 gallons daily from the Thames in excess of this amount. However, under sec. 2 of the Southwark and Vauxhall Act, 1897, the Company were temporarily authorized to take from the River Thames, but under certain restrictions, and whether or not in excess of 24,500,000 gallons in 24 hours, such quantity of water as may be required by them for the purpose of fulfilling obligations imposed on them by statute with respect to the supply of water within their limits. During the months of January, February and March there was a large excess of organic matter in the Thames. It was the same with the water supplied by the Company, which shows that the storage at the command of the Company was inadequate. The bacterial condition of the water from the filters, during the same three months, was also bad, for in every sample taken the number of microbes after filtration was in 24 excess of the bacterial standard of 100 microbes per cubic centimetre; on one occasion the number of microbes in the sample after filtration being as many as 2,368, and in another 1,396 per c. c. Of the 8 filters, numbers 2, 3 and 5 were found inefficient each time that a sample was taken, and not one of them was efficient on each occasion. Of 25 samples of water taken after filtration there was an infraction of the standard in as many as 13. Fortunately on no occasion was any pathogenic organism found even in the samples of Thames water taken. It must not, however, be forgotten that by the present method it is difficult to detect typhoid bacilli even in a sample to which a small quantity of typhoid material has purposely been added. Inefficient storage and filtration is, therefore, a constant source of danger, which might lead to an epidemic should the necessary combination of circumstances occur. During the past twelve months experiments have been made which prove that typhoid bacilli and the bacillus enteriditis sporogenes, which is considered to be the organism that causes epidemic summer diarrhoea, can flourish in polluted soil. Additional weight is thus given to the opinions mentioned in my report for the year 1895, namely, that leaky mains and service pipes might be one of the causcs of typhoid fever and summer diarrhoea. I then called your attention to the fact that in many places the depth of the mains below the surface was less 25 than two feet, and in some less than one foot. The service pipes, of course, are generally near the surface. Also, that in this climate provision ought to be made for frost, considering the great inconvenience and danger to the public, not only during the time it lasts, but afterwards on account of the burst water pipes and mains. A small leakage may not be found out for a long time, and if this should be adjacent to specifically polluted soil, dangerous consequences might arise.
