Public Health Department, Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. Dear Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting for your consideration my thirtysixth Annual Report which deals with the vital statistics and general sanitary work for the year 1922. It will be seen that there has been a decrease in the birth-rate of 2.9, whilst the death-rate has increased 1.2 per 1,000. The infantile mortality rate has considerably decreased, from 90 in 1921, to 79 for the present year. The deaths from Measles were very numerous, being 145. This number has not been exceeded for the last 12 years. My report on Measles will be found on pages 58 and 59. There has also been an increase in the deaths from Whooping Cough, the number, with the exception of the year 1918, exceeding that of any year for the last 10 years. Primary Pneumonia and Influenzal Pneumonia were responsible for a large number of deaths. Necessitous children and expectant and nursing mothers received free milk to the extent of £2,300. The milk scale for necessitous persons has been slightly reduced, and the income must not exceed 35s. for parents with 1 child, 40s. for 2 children, 45s. for 4 children, aud 50s. over 4 children. The Maternity and Child Welfare work has progressed exceedingly well during the year as will be seen by the statistics set out in my report pages 65 to 77. All Saints' Centre has returned to its old quarters at the Parish Room, Sunrey Square. St. Mary's Centre which was a Voluntary one, holding its sessions at St. John's Institute, Larcom street, has been taken over as a Municipal Centre with its home at St. Mary's Parochial Hall, Kennington Park Road. A subsidy has been given by the Council of rather more than £200 a year to St. John's Voluntary Centre, Larcom Street. I have advised that the Dental Clinic held in the Parochial Hall, Lorrimore Street, which has been in existence for more than a year should be discontinued as being unnecessary, on account of the opening of a new Dental Clinic by the Newington United Charities in Penrose Street, and the facilities that are given for dental treatmeut at the various large hospitals in or near our Borough. The Dental Clinic is an expensive affair both in regard to money spent and also the services given by the staff, 2 The health of the whole of the Public Health staff has been good during the year, except that I have to report the death of Mr. Rugg, Sanitary Inspector for St. Jude's Ward. The work of food inspection at the wharves has been very heavy during the year, but extremely well carried out by Mr. Fisher the Food Inspector, under my supervision. The Eats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, has been in operation during the year and many houses infested with rats have been cleared of them. The whole of the health work has been carried out efficiently. I have to thank all the Officers under me for their zeal, and also the Council for their courtesy and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, G. B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, of the Borough of Southwark. PUBLIC HEALTH STAFF.

Southwark being a district completely built over, beyond the reconstruction and remodelling of old buildings, few new buildings have been erected. Two additional new blocks on the Tabard Street area have been completed. The representations made in 1919 of the East Street area and two or three smaller areas are still being considered by the London County Council, but no definite decision, up to the present time, has been arrived at. During the year many of our formerly out of work people have found employment. There is in Southwark a large number of casual labourers, carmen, and unemployable persons. I am afraid that in the future owing to our boys not being attached or apprenticed to a trade we shall see a great increase of unemployment and ill-equipped men, and consequently more general poverty. It is surprising even to those who know the district, how men who have not worked for years manage to keep themselves and their families in good condition and fairly well dressed. There must be an enormous number of charitable agencies to which they successfully appeal. As I have reported on many occasions Southwark is a district abounding in trades using partly manufactured materials, and such being the case unemployment would naturally fall more heavily upon such a district than upon those in which raw materials enter more largely into their staple trades. 13 The population of the several divisions of the Borough at each Census since 1811, and also the estimated population for 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1920, and 1922.

The number of Births registered in the Borough during 1922 was 4,035, of which 2,046 were males, and 1,989 females. This represents a birth-rate of 216 per 1,000 inhabitants. The number of births registered in the individual parishes was as follows:-Newington, 2,470; St. George the Martyr, 1,113; Christchurch and St. Saviour's, 452. Of the 4,035 births registered in the Borough 81 were transferred away, the permanent residence of the parents being outside the Borough. 622 births occurring in various lying-in and other institutions outside the Borough, but belonging to Southwark parents, were notified to me by the Registrar-General. When the 81 "outward" transfers are deducted 15 and the 622 " inward " transfers are added to the 4,035 births actually registered in the Borough, the net amount of births belonging to Southwark for the year is found to be 4,576. This gives a corrected birth.rate of 24.4. Birth.rate for the last Thirty Years for the Three Divisions of the Borough as formerly existed. Newington. St. George's St. Saviour's and Christchurch.

These deaths in institutions comprised 372 belonging to Southwark and 518 to other sanitary districts. The number of inhabitants belonging to the Borough dying away from home—that is outside our boundaries in the various hospitals and infirmaries—was 1,290. When the 535 deaths of those persons who were non.parishioners, but who died in our Borough, have been deducted, and the 1,290 "outlying" deaths added, the actual or "corrected" number of deaths belonging to the sanitary area is found to be 2,895 of which number 1,610 were males and 1,285 females. The death.rate when calculated on this " corrected" number is 15'5 per 1,000 inhabitants for the whole Borough for the year 1922, as against a rate of 14 3 for 1921. The percentage of persons dying away from Southwark in relation to the total number of deaths belonging to the Borough was 44'6.

Three cases of this disease occurred during the year 1922, two of these cases were notified. They arose from an undiscovered and therefore unnotified case in the person of a female aged 14 years, of 51, Cambridge Street. It was found that 14 days after visiting 19, Fairfoot Road, Poplar, this girl had a few spots on her face for which she had no medical attention. About a fortnight after the father fell ill with a few spots on the face. At the end of another fortnight the mother fell ill, also with spots on the face. The last-mentioned patient developed well marked small-pox and she was removed with her husband to hospital on the 20th December. All the contacts in the house were vaccinated, and the boroughs concerned were notified of the contacts living outside our district Two sets of bedding were destroyed, and the blankets, sheets and other articles were passed through our steam disinfector. The Ministry of Health, the London County Council, the Vaccination Officer, and the Guardians were all apprised of the outbreak. A letter was received from the Clerk to the Guardians asking for information in regard to the cases together with any suggestions thereon, which were supplied to him. Subsequently a letter was received from the Clerk to the Guardians informing the Medical Officer of Health that the Guardians had decided to authorise their Public Vaccinators to vaccinate or re-vaccinate all persons living or working within the areas of their respective districts. A notice was printed and published in the borough explaining the facilities afforded by the Guardians for free vaccination and re-vaccination. Copies of a circular on small-pox were also issued in the neighbourhood of the outbreak, and up to the present time (January 20th) no further case has occurred. On January 19th the two cases were discharged from the hospital as recovered. SCARLET FEYER. During the year under consideration 802 cases were notified, as against 1,266 cases in 1921. The number of deaths from this disease was 17. The greatest number of eases occurred in St. Mary, St. John, All Saints' and St. Michael's Wards. The number of eases notified, as compared with London, during the last ten years was:— 57 In Southwark. In London.

The deaths in the 794 cases sent to hospital numbered 17, a mortality of 2.1 per cent. In regard to the 9 cases nursed at home, they all recovered. The annual rate of mortality was 0.10. DIPHTHERIA. There has been an increase in the number of cases of Diphtheria notified during the year under consideration. The total notifications numbered 749 and the deaths 61 for the year. The percentage of deaths to the cases notified was 8.1. The annual mortality per 1,000 inhabitants was 0.33.

In regard to the 6 cases nursed at home, 1 died, a mortality of 16.7 per cent. ENTERIC FEVER. Three death from Enteric Fever occurred in the borough during the year, as against 1, 5 and 3, in the three preceding years. The total number of cases notified was 3 for the present year, and 7, 8 and 12 for the three preceding years. The number of cases notified during the last ten years:— 1913 39 1918 8 1914 24 191912 1915 23 1920 8 1916 13 1921 7 1917 10 1922 3 The number of deaths from Enteric Fever for the last ten years:— 1913 6 1918 1 1914 2 1919 3 1915 3 1920 5 1916 2 1921 1 1917 5 1922 3 Of the 3 cases notified 3 were removed to hospital, all of which died, a mortality of 100.0 per cent. MEASLES. During the year under consideration 3,214 cases of this disease were notified with 145 deaths. At the height of the epidemic I made the following report:— "The number of cases notified to the Medical Officer of Health during the quarter ending April 1st, was 1,977, with 448 secondary cases, making a total of 2,425. There were 1,526 under live years of age, and 899 over five years of age. 59 "With our knowledge of previous epidemics it may be fairly assumed that only two-thirds of the cases occurring were brought to our notice. So that in the quarter the number of cases of measles must have exceeded 3,200. There were 75 deaths from measles in the same period. The percentage of deaths to the number of cases was 23. In most of the cases notified the certificate was received early. On the receipt of the notification every case was at once visited by a nurse. This number of cases has occupied the full time of three and sometimes four officers. It has been found that a nurse can only properly attend and give advice as prescribed by the Ministry of Health to 15 cases daily. At the commencement of the epidemic we had one nurse for measles who very early fell sick and was absent for a period of seven weeks. On my report of the extension of the epidemic and the illness of the measles nurse, the Committee appointed at once two temporary nurses which I supplemented with one health visitor detached from her maternity and child welfare work. The largest number of cases notified was on March 11th. Since then there has only been a slight decline. The sick measles nurse returned to duty on March 6th, but we still need for nursing measles the three nurses at the present time engaged in this work, that is, if all the cases are to be visited and properly looked after. Tne percentage of deaths to the total estimated number of cases during the last epidemic was 4.5. The staff at the present time for visiting and attending cases of measles comprise our ordinary measles nurse and two temporary ones. The two temporary nurses will be discharged as soon as the epidemic shows signs of abatement or when the Council directs. It will be seen that in the present epidemic the case mortality has only been one half of what it was in the epidemic of 1918. There has certainly been improved nursing in the present epidemic." Deaths from Measles during the last ten years:— 1913 105 1918 145 1914 95 1919 19 1915 131 1920 63 1916 94 1921 6 1917 75 1922 145 The annual death-rate per 1,000 living was 0.77. DIARRHæA.

Many of the children treated were suffering from Scabies. In every case the treatment at our Station was thoroughly efficacious, and no recurrence of the trouble was experienced. 626 adults sent from the various common lodging houses and other places in our borough were cleansed during the year, as against 175 dealt with under the provisions of the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, in 1921. 84 TABLE 33.

Town Hall, South wark. GEORGE B. MILLSON, Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX. Borough of Southwark ANNUAL REPORT of the Tuberculosis Medical Officer foe the YEAR 1922. Horace Wilson, M.D., B.S., D.P.H., M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., Tuberculosis Medical Officer and Assistant Medical Officer of Health. BOROUGH OF SOUTHWARK. Southwark Tuberculosis Dispensary, 82-84, Newington Causeway, S.E. To the. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Southwark. Sir and Gentlemen, During the year 1922 the dispensary has been continuously busy and the results have been very satisfactory, the death-rate from pulmonary tuberculosis having diminished when compared with the previous year, in spite of an epidemic of influenza, which is always followed by an increase in the number of cases of tuberculosis. The new cases notified were slightly in excess of the previous year, but this denotes that they are being brought to light in greater numbers and that the practitioners are more particular as to notification rather than that there is any actual increase in the disease. Since the adoption of the dispensary scheme in Southwark there has been a steady decline in the deaths from the disease, as shown in the subjoined table:— 1914. 1915. 1916. 1917. 1918. 1919. 1920. 1931. 1922. 330 388 391 392 381 311 243 262 249 The above result may be largely attributed to the detection of early cases, the advice and instruction given by the staff of the dispensary as to the avoidance of infection and disposal of sputum, the disinfection aud stripping of infected rooms and the improvements effected by the visiting staff in the homes of the patients. The preventive side of the work in checking the spread of infection is more important than the curative, for taking the general length of the phthisical patient's life as five or six years, any case prevented in any given year means a lower death-rate five years later, thus a steady decline in the death-rate would naturally follow. With preventive measures we may also class sanatorium treatment, for though a short residence in sanatorium may mean a temporary 167 heck to the disease it rarely means a cure, and its chief value is purely educational. During the year arrangements have been made for the X-ray investigation of doubtful cases with Guy's Hospital, for the dental treatment of cases requiring it and for the induction of artificial pneumothorax, a fairly recent method of treatment which in suitable cases has yielded promising results. There are also facilities for utilising the Finsen Light treatment for tuberculosis of the skin. We have had four shelters in constant use and have ten beds on loan to patients to separate the members of a family where there is overcrowding and insufficient money for the patient to purchase a new bed. Leaflets of simple instructions are given to each patient, and 120 sputum flasks have been supplied for out-door use. The Care Committee has done much arduous and useful work on the social side of the question, assisting the patients with temporary help, clothing and nourishment, assessing the necessary payments, making arrangements for domestic affairs to be attended to during a patient's absence, and in every way possible—considering it has no fund on which to draw—trying to alleviate the family difficulties caused by the occurrence of the disease. In accordance with the instructions issued by the Ministry of Health more cases have been referred to panel practitioners for domiciliary treatment, and fewer attendances of old cases have been registered at the dispensary in consequence. The domiciliary cases, however, are not lost sight of, but are periodically examined as to their progress and condition and in other cases the panel practitioners render periodical reports on the patient's progress. During the year much needed additional facilities for the treatment of advanced cases have been added; this was badly wanted to take the more infectious cases from our midst, and is a further step forward in preventive treatment. There is also less reluctance on the part of the relatives than formerly to allow advanced cases to be removed to an institution within reasonable distance of their homes. In the present condition of the housing question the fight against tuberculosis is rendered most difficult, for overcrowding is a big problem—the families are too large for the accommodation they have got and other quarters are impossible to obtain. In many cases we find that the patients have 168 lived several years in one tenement and that their families have naturally increased without them being able to get more roomy accommodation. Again, if a member of a family is known to have contracted consumption there is a natural reluctance to letting rooms to that family on account of infecting clean rooms and the necessary spraying and disinfection at intervals, with stripping of walls on the removal of a case. Consequently it- is doubly difficult, in a case of overcrowding to find other dwellings for a family. It is, under the circumstances, satisfactory to uote a decline in the amount of tuberculosis in the Borough. 1 append tables giving statistics of the work done during the past year.
