TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT of THE VESTRY of the parish of ST. JAMES AND ST. JOHN, CLERKENNWELL. FOR THE YEAR 1881-2. Presented pursuant to the 198th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 18th and 19th Vict., cap. 120. LONDON: W. J. GOODE, PRINTER, 23, ST. JOHN'S LANE, CLERKENWELL. 1882. REPORT OF THE VESTRY For the Year ended 25th March, 1882. Pursuant to 18 and 19 Vic. Cap. 120, S. 198, the Vestry of the Parish of St. James and St. John, Clerkenwell, beg to present the following Report of the principal subjects of their proceedings under the Metropolis Local Management Act. and other Acts which are administered by them, during the year ending on the 25th March, 1882. Rates.—During the year the Eates made by the Vestry were as follows:— For the half-year to Michaelmas, 1881. A Poor Rate of 1s. 5d. in the £ estimated to realize £21,845 A Sewer ,, 4d. ,, ,, ,, 5,140 A Lighting „ 1d. „ ,, „ 1,285 A General „ 9d. ,, ,, ,, 11,565 2/7 £39,835 For the half-year to Lady-day, 1882. A Poor Eate of 1s. 5d. in the £ estimated to realize £21,845 A Main drainage Eate of 2d. ,, ,, ,, 2,570 A Lighting „ 1d. „ „ „ 1,285 A General „ 1/0 ,, ,, ,, 15,420 2/8 £41,120 The Rates made in April for the half-year to Michaelmas were based upon a rateable value of £327,604, and those for the half-year to Lady.day, 1882, on a rateable value of £331,468. The amounts required by the Guardians of the Holborn Union were £22,427 in the first, and £23,211 in the second halfyear, towards which the Parish of Clerkenwell received from the Common Poor Fund £3,432 15s., and £5,301 9s. 9d. in the first and second half-years respectively. 4 The precept of the Metropolitan Board of Works for the year amounted to £8,106 11s. 8d., and that of the School Board to £7,900 4s. 4d. Tho Police precepts for the year amounted to £6,629. It will thus be seen that of the £80,955 raised during the year, the sum of £59,539, or nearly three-fourths, was required by bodies beyond the control of the Vestry. Vacant Land at junction of Cyrus Street and Percival Street.—The negociations which were opened last year with the Marquis Northampton for the improvement of tho unsightly piece of vacant ground at the junction of Cyrus Street and Percival Street, have resulted in the land being leased to the Yestry for seven years at a peppercorn rent, upon condition that the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain Association be allowed to erect a fountain thereon. This has been done, and the land pavel by the Vestry with Yictoria stone, the appearance of the place being thereby much improved. Old Toll House, 247, Pentonville Road.—Notice to quit having been served upon Mr. Hammond, the tenant of the premises, in order that the ground may be let for building purposes, a letter was received from Mr. W. T. Smith, the freeholder of No. 245, offering his freehold for sale. The Yestry considered that their property would be greatly improved by the acquisition of Mr. Smith's interest, as he had ancient lights which would interfere with the Vestry's land, and it was eventually purchased for the sum of £650; Messrs. Groode and Robson, the Churchwardens, being appointed Trustees of this property on behalf of the Vestry. Proposed New Street from Gray's Inn Road to the Angel.—On the 27th of June, 1881, this Vestry, with the Vestry of Islington and the Holborn District Board of Works, attended as a Deputation upon the Metropolitan Board of Works, and presented Memorial, again urging the desirability of the formation of a new street from Gray's Inn Road, at the corner of Clerkenwell 5 Road, to the Angel, but in consequence of the magnitude of the schemes already in hand, the Metropolitan Board of Works were unable to take steps in the matter at present. Sekforde Street Improvement.—The Vestry also had under consideration the desirability of memorialising the Metropolitan Board of Works to remove the obstructions at the north and south ends of Sekforde Street, with the view of opening up a more direct communication between the north and south and south-west London, and the new Farringdon Road Market, but no decisive action was taken. St. John Street Improvement, widening of narrow portion of.—The Vestry also had under consideration the question of the desirability of widening St. John Street from Albemarle Street northward, to which attention has been directed on several previous occasions, but especially by resolution of the Board of the 4th April, 1878, but after consideration by the Committee of Works on the 1st November, 1881, it was con. sidered that the improvement is one which should be carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works, as a Metropolitan Improvement, and the further consideration of the matter as a Local Improvement was therefore adjourned sine die. Colney Hatch Lane, Muswell Hill.—In May, 1881, a letter was received from certain of the purchasers of plots of land fronting on Colney Hatch Lane, asking that the Vestry would widen the road to 45 feet throughout, they agreeing to give up land for the purpose. In consequence of this letter the Vestry directed that letters be addressed to each of the other owners of the land fronting on the road, stating that the Vestry wereprepared to widen the road upon the necessary land being given up for the purpose. This resulted in an offer being made by the frontagers on the part of the road which was less than 40 feet, that they would give up the necessary land to make the road 40 feet wide, provided the Vestry kerb, channel, and drain 6 the paths. This offer, after considerable deliberation was accepted, and tenders were invited for the work, Messrs. Mowlem & Co.'s at £523, being accepted. Paving.—A considerable quantity of new paving has been laid during the year, Pentonville Road, from the "Angel" to the "Belvedere," was newly paved, and the footways relaid with Victoria Stone. King's Cross Road, from the Union Tavern to the Brewery, 42, King's Cross Road, was taken up, redressed, and relaid on concrete, and made good with new. Clerkenwell Green, the greater part of St. John's Square, Great Bath Street, Little Bath Street, and Little Northampton Street, were paved with the old material taken up from Pentonville Road and King's Cross Road, which, being of the larger kind, was found nearly as good as new for the purpose when redressed. The cost of these works was £6,862 11s. 0d., towards which the Vestry borrowed £6,500 of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to cover the cost of the new work, at 3½ per cent., repayable in 20 years in equal annual instalments. Metropolis Water Supply.—Messrs. Leaver and Brighty were again appointed Delegates to a Conference of the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis, held at the Vestry Hall, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields to consider this subject, (referred to last year,) and in November a copy of a Memorial proposed to be presented to the Prime Minister by the Delegates, urging that the question of the Metropolitan Water Supply may be legislated upon without further delay, in the spirit of the Report of the House of Commons, Session II, 1880, was laid before the Vestry and approved. Ground Rent for Pentonville Road and Penton Place.—In June, 1881, Mr. Patrick called the attention of the Board to the payment of £27 per annum to Colonel Penton for Ground Rent of Pentonville Road and Penton Place as being wrong in principle. The matter was referred to the Solicitors, who reported that the sums of £18 for Pentonville Road, and £9 for Penton Place, were fixed when the roads were made through 7 the Penton Estate in the last century, and binding contracts were entered into; that the rents were regularly paid until 1838, when the Parish appears to have disputed its liability, whereupon legal proceedings were instituted, which resulted in the establishment of Colonel Penton's rights to the rents. Under these circumstances the Vestry decided that it was inexpedient to raise the question of the claim. Proceedings under the Valuation Act, 1869.—One of the most important proceedings of the year, as affecting the interests of the Ratepayers, occurred under this head. Prom the year 1870, when the Valuation Act first came into operation, the Assessment Committee of the Holborn Union, as advised, have held that after an assessment has been fixed, it could not be altered until the next quinquennial revision of the Valuation List, except in consequence of some structural alteration of the premises, a view which the Vestry have always combatted, but hitherto without success. But in July, 1881, a Provisional List was presented to the Assessment Committee containing several strong cases in point, notably the shops in Goswell Road under the Compton Buildings, which were originally let at £60 per annum on lease, and assessed accordingly. The rentals however could not be sustained, and even before the expiration of the leases an allowance of £12 per annum was made on the rents of many of the shops as an equivalent to a reduction of the rents. Soon after the making out of the Valuation List in 1880 these leases expired, and the rents of the shops were mostly reduced from £60 to £45, and the tenants appealed, with the result that these cases, with others of the like kind, were submitted to the Assessment Committee of the Union, and Counsel's opinion taken upon the question, who approved of the views of the Vestry in the matter, and the practice of the Assessment Committee was thenceforward reversed, and the views of the Vestry were agreed to be acted upon in the future. The Vestry Clerk's report, giving the Case and Opinion in extenso, being of considerable importance, is as follows:— 8 Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, October 21st, 1881. VALUATION METROPOLIS ACT, 1869. Gentlemen, I have the honor to report that, pursuant to Resolution of the Board of the 30th June last, I forwarded to the Assessment Committee of the Holborn Union the Provisional List then adopted, submitting certain cases for an alteration of the assessments since the quinquennial valuation was made, in consequence of material alteration of rentals consequent upon alterations of value, as recommended by your Assessment Committee of the 14th and 15th June last. That on the 29th August the Assessment Committee met to revise such list, and heard the Appeals then made. With regard to the cases submitted for a reduction of the assessments above referred to, I felt it desirable to submit the views of the Clerkenwell Vestry in writing, as regards the wording of Clause 47 of the Act, and the apparent intention of the Legislature in so framing the Clause. It will be remembered that, from the time of the Act coming into operation, cases arose from time to time when your Assessment Committee thought the Act should have been made to apply in favor of alterations of assessment under special circumstances, and that such cases were repeatedly sent to the Holborn Union with a recommendation that the assessments be modified according to such special circumstances, but without avail, the views of the Assessment Committee of the Union not being in accord with those of the Vestry, they ruling that a structural alteration only would justify an alteration of an assessment. On the letter above referred to being read the Union Assessment Committee referred it to their legal adviser with instructions to take Counsel's Opinion thereon, considering the case, as put, to be of a nature calling for further advice; the case, when drawn up, to be submitted to the other Vestry Clerks of the Union also for their observations thereon. Counsel's Opinion 9 has been taken accordingly, the letter referred to forming the basis of the case for such Opinion, which case will, therefore, speak for itself. I have now the honor to submit the Case and Opinion as follows:— THE METROPOLIS (VALUATION) ACT, 1869. The Assessment Committee of the Holborn Union in the County of Middlesex. STATEMENT for the advice of Counsel as to the operation and application of ss 46 and 47 of the above Act in certain cases. The Assessment Committee of the Holborn Union have from time to time had cases brought before them in relation to their powers and duties under the above-mentioned ss., which have caused them considerable embarrassment. The Vestry of the Parish of St. James, Clerkenwell, a Parish in the Holborn Union, have lately submitted to the Assessment Committee a Provisional Valuation List under Section 47 of the Act. In this List the Vestry have reduced the assessments of certain hereditaments, the Gross and Rateable values of which had been fixed by the last quinquennial or Supplemental Valuation List. The reduction has been made by the Vestry substantially on the ground that the rents of the hereditaments in question have been reduced since the Quinquennial List, or last Supplemental List, was made. Mr. Paget, the Vestry Clerk of St. James, Clerkenwell, addressed a letter to the Assessment Committee, to explain the views of the Vestry. This letter, which contains the arguments on which the Vestry base their opinions, is as follows:— VESTRY OF THE PARISH OF ST. JAMES & ST. JOHN, CLERKENWELL. Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, 58, Rosoman Street, E.C., August 24th, 1881. To the Assessment Committee, Holborn Union. Gentlemen, I have to call special attention to the following cases brought before you in the present Provisional Valuation List: 10 1a Penton Street. These premises, being newly built, were at first let at £70 per annum and assessed accordingly. It was evident that this was a speculative rental only, and results have proved that it could not be maintained, the tenant failed to pay the rent and loft. The premises were empty for some time, but were ultimately let for £52 on an agreement, the tenant to do the necessary repairs if required. This being a bona fide letting the Vestry have reduced the assessment accordingly to £54 gross value. Nos. 113, 117, 125, 127, 131, 133, Goswell Road. These premises, being new, were originally let at £60 per annum each on agreement for seven years, and were assessed accordingly. Long before the expiration of the term, it was found that these rentals could not be maintained, and the owners, the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company, returned £12 per annum to each of the tenants in reduction of the rents, and they appealed for a reduction of the Assessment in consequence, but the Vestry declined to entertain the appeal while the rental stood at £60 under the agreement. The term of the Agreements having recently expired, the rents have been reduced to £45, and on appeal the Vestry have reduced the Assessments accordingly, and they very strongly urge you to confirm such alterations, the Vestry being strongly of opinion that these bona fide alterations of value are such as Clause 47 of the Act distinctly contemplates and provides for. You will at once see the extreme hardship and injustice to the Tenants, and how it would militate against letting such premises, were the present assessments at £60 each continued for the ensuing five years. 102, St. John Street. Reduced from £120 to £90; and 202 St. John Street reduced from £50 to £30. The same may be said of these cases. In urging you to confirm these alterations, the Vestry feel they have both law and equity on their side, and that Provisional and Supplemental Lists were, to use the words of Chief Justice 11 Cockburn "intended to rectify what might otherwise work very "unjustly,— a valuation to extend for a period of 5 years without "any opportunity of amending it, if it ceased to be in harmony "with the actual facts," and that "if by any unlooked for "circumstances the value of a property should be increased or "diminished, the assessments ought not to continue to exist." [Reg. v. New River Co. L.R.: Q.B. page 309.] You will remember that in February, 1873, after inquiry made, I forwarded you replies from Islington, St. Pancras, St. Marylebone, Paddington, Chelsea, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Shoreditch, and St. Mary Newington, stating that they all acted upon Clause 47 as above suggested, feeling convinced that the wording of the clause was so intended. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. The Assessment Committee, on receipt of this Provisional Valuation List and letter, asked the opinion of their Solicitor on the point. The difficulty, amongst others, had arisen very soon after the Act had come into operation, and a case was laid before Mr. Crompton Hutton who advised as follows in June, 1872, "The Rent is only one circumstance from which to ascertain the "value. The raising or reducing of the rent does not in itself "increase or reduce the value. I think therefore that this "question must be answered in the negative." It is understood that several other cases on the point have been submitted to Counsel, who have advised, some in the affirmative, and some in the negative. The Solicitor to the Assessment Committee advised them that the scheme of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act was generally to settle the assessments for a period of five years, that ss 46 and 47 provided for actual alterations, or change in the value of hereditaments assessed, and did not extend to cases in which there 12 was merely a different estimate of the value, or alteration in the amount of rent; that with regard to the case Regina v. New River Company, 4 L.R. Q.B. page 309, there was an actual increase in the value of the hereditament assessed by additions to it since the last valuation had been made, that if the reduction of the rent of a hereditament during the quinquennial period authorised a reduction in the Assessment, so an increase in the rent must, in such case, authorise an increase in the Assessment, and so the scheme of the act for a quinquennial re-assessment would be mainly frustrated. The Committee, however, conceive that such cases as those comprised in the Clerkenwell Provisional List are cases of real hardship, and they desire (if it be open to them,) to apply a remedy: they are told that other Metropolitan Assessment Committees deal with such cases as within ss 46 and 47, and that if it be lawful for others. it is lawful for them to do so. In the absence of authoritative decision they desire to have your opinion on the questions raised. The following remarks on the Case submitted are added [by Mr. Paget,] with the view of eliciting from Counsel his view of the intention of the Act of Parliament, and the authority of the Assessment Committee, so that the rating authorities of the Parish may be satisfied with the decisions of the Committee:— "It must be distinctly understood that Clerkenwell "dues not claim that the Act gives power to alter the "Valuation List every time a mere capricious alteration of "rent takes place, but cases do, and must occur occasionally, "when the value of premises is so very materially affected "by surrounding circumstances, that a corresponding "alteration of the rent is forced to follow. A populous "neighbourhood might be swept away from around a house "of business which depended on it, rendering it valueless, "or vice versa, during the term of the Valuation List, and it 13 "it is a well-established fact, proved by experience, that "the rents asked, and sometimes agreed to be given, for a "new house and shop, warehouse, or the like, are purely "speculative, and form but little criterion of the actual and "abiding value which will be maintained year after year, "as in the case of the shops in the Goswell Road, given "above. In such cases, which have become so out of "harmony with the principle of a general and equitable "assessment intended by the Act, Clerkenwell submits that "Clauses 46 and 47 come in to rectify glaring errors and "irregularities, and that the operation of the latter clause "is not confined to "Structural" alterations." E. PAGET. I quite agree with the spirit of Mr. Paget's memorandum at the foot of the draft Case: a house of business, depending on the neighbourhood, might be rendered much less valuable by the taking down of many houses in the neighbourhood, or much more valuable by many houses being built and occupied during the quinquennial period, and in either case I think there would be statutable authority to alter the Valuation by reducing or raising the Assessment as the case might require; and so other surrounding circumstances might justify such alterations; but there must be an occurrence of some such circumstances to justify the alterations, and in the cases referred to in the Case it is not alleged that any such have occurred. I think therefore that Mr. Paget's Memorandum would somewhat embarrass the Case, and render the Opinion of Counsel, which the Assessment Committee require to guide them in this case, less useful than it ought to be. EDWD. WALLWYN JAMES. Clarendon House, Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, September 6th, 1881. Dear Sir, I have been flitting about a little of late, hence the delay in returning Draft Case, which I now do, with thanks. 14 You have very fully and fairly stated the Case, but I have added a Memo. as I am anxious it should he made very clear that we do not claim that a Valuation List should be altered on a mere alteration of rent which, of itself, may be of no significance worth notice, and Mr. Crompton Hutton's Opinion appears to be on this point only, and therefore does not bear upon our cases. I do not wish to encumber the Case, but if you could accept my Memo. or embody so much of it as will make our contention still plainer, (if that be possible,) you will oblige. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very truly, E. W. James, Esq. ROBERT PAGET. I hope this delay in returning case will not cause you any inconvenience. Clarendon House, Christchurch Road, Bournemouth, September 10th, 1881. Dear Sir, Yours of the 8th has reached me here. If you think the Memo. I appended to the Case for Counsel undesirable as complicating it, use your discretion as to using it, or any portion of it. But I cannot help thinking that the supposed case, and the actual cases stated in my letter, are in the same category; the values have become materially altered by unforseen circumstances, from some "cause" other than structural alterations, and not from a mere whimsical and trivial alteration of rent. It is impossible for an Act of Parliament to provide for every case which may arise; something must be left for those who have to administer the law, and I cannot help thinking that the local authorities, knowing all the local circumstances, may be safely left to deal with special cases as they arise, as apparently contemplated by the wording of the 47th Clause, which so clearly provides for an alteration of value, other than from structural alteration. 15 Hoping you are enjoying a little change to the benefit of your health. I am, Dear Sir, Yours very truly, ROBERT PAGET. E. W. James, Esq., Haworth House, Pangbourne, Berks. PARISH OF ST. LUKE, MIDDLESEX. Vestry Clerk's Office, Vestry Hall, City Road, E.C., 13th September, 1881. Dear Sirs, I am much obliged to you for giving me the opportunity of perusing the Case you propose to submit to Counsel on the question of re-assessing properties on reductions being made in the rents. I fear in the face of so many able opinions to the contrary, it is useless to urge the pure justice of many cases which are brought to the notice of the Parochial Authorities, cases in which, if equity was allowed to prevail, reductions should be made. I cannot help feeling we get into the bad habit of placing as narrow constructions upon Acts of Parliament as is possible, sometimes entirely to press out the little spirit infused into them by their promoters, and thereby permit the continuance of hardships never contemplated to be created. It is in consequence of this feeling that I have considerable sympathy with many of Mr. Paget's observations. I am quite aware that if the argument he uses be brought into practical working, it might result in abuse, but I venture to think that the cases in which it would be abused would be infinitely fewer in number than those in which substantial justice might be done. I anticipate the opinion will be ver similar in effect to that printed on p. 127 of Lumley's Union Assessment Committee Acts, 10th Edition. I return the Draft of the Case with Mr. Paget's note attached. 16 Allow mo to suggest that a copy of the Case and Opinion should be presented by the Union Assessment Committee to the Vestry Clerks of the various Parishes in the Union. Yours truly, Messrs. James, Son & James, G. W. PRESTON. 23, Ely Place, E.C. UNITED PARISHES OF ST. ANDREW, HOLBORN ABOVE-THE-BARS and ST. GEORGE THE MARTYR, MIDDLESEX. BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND DIRECTORS. 47, Chancery Lane, W.C., 19th September, 1881. Dear Sirs, VALUATION ACT, 1869. I have perused the draft Case to be submitted to Counsel. The statement meets, I think, the points raised, and upon which Counsel's Opinion is to be sought. Nothing at present occurs to me to add to the Case herewith returned, I am, Dear Sirs, Yours truly, Messrs. James. Son & James, S. W. HOPWOOD. 22, Ely Place. OPINION. Section 47 enacts that "if in the course of any year the value of any hereditament is, from any cause, increased or reduced in value, a Provisional list is to be made," and Section 46 enacts "that the Supplemental list shall, every year, show all the alterations which have taken place during the preceding 12 months, in any of the matters stated in the Valuation List." The Case relating to the New River Co. 4 L.R. Q.B. 309 S.C. 48 L.J.M.C. 123, no doubt differs from the facts of the present Case. Cockburn L.C.J. in that case said "that the Supplemental List should show the alterations in the gross and rateable value," and referring to the provision contained in Section 46, he said, "I 17 "cannot help thinking that it was intended to rectify what might "otherwise work very unjustly—a valuation to extend for a "period of 5 years, without any opportunity of amending it, if it "ceased to be in harmony with actual facts." I feel the force of Mr. James' objection to the alterations which have been made on the ground that the houses are the same, and the neighbourhood is the same, and that there has been only a difference in the rent. On the whole, however, I think that the view taken by parish is the correct one, and that the Assessment Committee may be well advised to approve of the alterations, on the ground that the houses referred to are reduced in value. I think it may be fairly said that when the Quinquennial List was settled, the rents paid showed that they were of a certain value at the time, but that as now no such rents can be obtained, they are reduced in value. The rent paid is, no doubt, evidence of the value, but the value of a house must, after all, depend upon what rent can be obtained for it. If a house, at one time, will let at one rent, and, at a subsequent period, will only let for a lower rent, I think it may be said that it is reduced in value. Cockburn L.C.J. said "I think the good sense of those who have to deal with this matter would make them not go into very minute enquiries. It is only where substantial alterations have taken place, which really do make all the difference to the individual who is to be assessed on the one hand, or to the Parish which is to have the benefit of the tax, on the other, that an inquiry should be directed. Acting upon the spirit of this judgment, I think, as before stated, the Committee should approve of the new List. HARRY BODKIN POLAND, October 3rd, 1881. 5, Paper Buildings, Temple. On the 11th inst. the Assessment Committee of the Union again met to receive the opinion of Counsel, and having received and considered it, a Resolution was passed that such Opinion be received and acted upon in future. The cases submitted for alteration of Assessment, which had been adjourned for 18 sel's Opinion, were accordingly reduced in accordance with your recommendation, and I have the honor to congratulate the Vestry on its views as to the meaning and intention of the 47th Clause of the Act being ultimately supported by Counsel's Opinion and adopted by the Assessment Committee of the Union, which will remedy what has hitherto operated as an injustice to some of the ratepayers, and a great inconvenience to the Vestry as the rating authority of the Parish. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. A letter was also received from Mr. J. W. Hill, Clerk to the Assessment Committee, stating that in future the Committee would act upon the opinion of Mr. Poland, now given. So well satisfied were the Vestry with this result that they were pleased to pass a unanimous vote of thanks to the Vestry Clerk for his persistent and successful exertions in the matter. Tramway Schemes.—The Schemes before the Vestry in November for the ensuing Session were the Steep Grade Tramway Company's Scheme, proposing to lay tramways up Pentonville Hill, to be worked by mechanical power; the London Street Tramway Company's Scheme, also proposing to lay tramways up Pentonville Road, uniting their line at King's Cross with that of the North Metropolitan at the "Angel;" and the North Metropolitan Tramway Company's Scheme, proposing to lay tramways in Clerkenwell Road, from Goswell Road westward to Bloomsbury. Upon the Companies agreeing to pay the Vestry the present value of the paving taken to by them, the Vestry gave its consent to each of the Schemes, but no results were arrived at within the period comprised in this Report.* *The Steep Grade and Clerkenwell Road Schemes subsequently proved unsuccessful in Parliament, but the London Street Tramway Scheme up Pentonville Hill was successful 19 Regent's Canal, City and Docks Hallway Scheme.—The Vestry have also had under consideration this Scheme, by which it is proposed to construct railways from the Great Western and Hammersmith and City Railways at Paddington to the Royal Albert Dock of the London and St. Katherine's Docks Company, together with junctions with the Midland and Great Northern Railways, and to acquire certain property near the northern boundary of the Parish. This Scheme the Vestry dissented from, and a petition was presented to Parliament against same, with the view to the insertion of a Clause in the Bill securing to the Yestry the payment of rates upon the property taken to, while the works are in course of construction, and generally to protect the interests of the Parish. The matter was in this stage on the 25th March, but there is great probability of the Bill passing.† London Riverside Fish Market Scheme.—This Scheme, by which it is proposed to establish a Riverside Fish Market at Shadwell, has also been before the Yestry. The Bill is promoted by an influential section of the fishermen on the east coast, but is opposed by the Corporation of London, who claim a right under a charter of Edward III. to prevent the opening of any new market within seven miles of the City. The Vestry petitioned in favour of the Bill, which on the 25th March was making good progress in Parliament.*** Chalets.—In December the Vestry appointed a Special Committee to consider the proposals of the Chalet Company to provide lavatory and water-closet accommodation in the public thoroughfares, especially for women, by the erection of light ornamental structures, and, after consideration, gave the Company permission to erect one of their Chalets on Clerkenwell Green. † Since this Report has been in type the Bill has received the Royal assent. *** Since the Report has been in type the Bill has received the Royal assent, 20 Incidence of Local Taxation.—In December, the Vestry of Kensington invited the Vestry to appoint Delegates to consider the question of the incidence of local taxation, and Mr. Sans and Mr. Jennings were appointed as such delegates, and on the 16th March, Mr. Jennings laid before the Vestry copy of a Memorial which it was proposed to be forwarded by the local authorities to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, praying that they will take the subject into their serious consideration, and will move the Legislature at an early date to adopt such measures as may be expedient to relieve tho occupiers of houses and land from the undue burden they now bear under the Elementary Education, Poor Law, and such like Acts, by an equitable system of raising the funds for defraying expenditure of that description. This Vestry approved the Memorial, and a copy was forwarded to the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. Disorderly Houses.—In January a Memorial was forwarded to the Home Secretary, praying that the duty of the suppression of disorderly houses may bo transferred from the local authorities to the police, and a copy was forwarded to the several local authorities in the Metropolis, and the following replies were received:— From the Parishes of Battersea, Bermondsey, Hammersmith, Islington, Lambeth, Lewisham, Limehouse, Saint Luke, Mile End, St. Nicholas, Deptford, and Ratcliff, agreeing with the views of the Vestry, and stating that Memorials to the same effect had been forwarded to the Home Secretary. From Stoke Newington, stating that they do not suffer from the evil complained of. From St. Olave's, Southwark, agreeing that the local authority should bo relieved of the duty, but stating that they are not prepared to say to whom such duty should be transferred. 21 From the Parishes of Fulham, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and Paddington, stating that they have taken no action in the matter. From Kensington, disagreeing with the views of the Vestry. From St. Pancras, stating that they are satisfied with the present state of the law. From Chelsea, disagreeing with the views of the Vestry, and expressing the opinion that it is undesirable at the present time to show that local authorities wish to be relieved of any part of their duties. Trees.—Referring to this subject reported upon last year, thirty-one fresh plane trees were planted in the parish, to replace those which has died during the year. Lighting of the Parish.—In January last a Special Committee was appointed to consider the whole question of the lighting of the parish, with instructions to ascertain the practicability of lighting a portion of the parish with the Electric Light, and as a result of their labours, the following resolutions were passed by the Vestry on the 16th March, as a result of the general report of the Committee thereon:— (1.) That the tender of the Electric Light and Power Generator Company, to light Pentonville Road with their incandescent lamps for one year, for an estimated sum of £467 17s. 6d. be accepted. (2.) That the street lamps (now burning 4 feet of Gas per hour,) be restored to the 5 feet per hour system as formerly, but with the modified hours as at present, and that the Gas Company be asked to use Sugg's or Borrodaile's Patent Governor and Burner instead of those now in use. (3.) That permission be given to Messrs. Hegan and Co., to experiment with their system of compressed air 22 and gas in the lamps from Clerkenwell Green through Sekforde Street and St. John Street Road, to the "Angel," at their own expense. And these matters were referred back to the Special Committee to carry out. Municipal Government of London.—It being announced in the Queen's Speech at the opening of Parliament that a measure would be introduced "for the reform of the ancient and distinguished Corporation of London, and the extension of Municipal Government to the Metropolis at large," the Metropolitan Board of Works, on the 7th February, 1882, issued a letter to the several Vestries and District Boards of Works, asking that in view thereof, the information furnished in 1870 and 1875, as to the works and improvements carried out by such local authorities since their establishment in 1856, and the cost of same, might be continued to the 25th March, 1881. The Return was duly prepared, in pursuance to its reference to the Vestry Clerk, and forwarded, and, so far as relates to this Vestry, is briefly as follows:— Total length of new sewers constructed from 1st January, 1856, to 25th March, 1881 1 mile, 1,736 yds. Total cost of the same £3,122 14 7 Total cost of any other sanitary works executed by the Vestry £24,691 17 0 Total superficial area of paving laid down from 1st January, 1856, to 25th March, 1881 198,368 sq. yds. Total cost of the same £74,437 10 4 Total cost of any other street improvements executed by the Vestry £45,984 18 3 23 Number of additional street lamps put up from 1st January, 1856, to 25th. March, 1881 55 Present mileage of the streets and roads under the jurisdiction of the Vestry 19¾ miles. Letters were also received from various Vestries and District Boards, expressing the opinion that no change will be satisfactory that has not for its object the retention by the ratepayers of full control over their local affairs. Owing to other and more urgent business, no Bill for the reform of the government of the Metropolis has been introduced into the present session of Parliament. As it may be interesting, in connection with the above Return, to know what has been done and reported as the Vestry's work since its formation, the Returns previously made, the Original (1870), and Supplemental (1874), are hereunto annexed. [See end of the book.] Printing Minutes.—On the 28th April, 1881, a resolution was passed that the minutes of the Board and Committees should be printed and forwarded to the Vestrymen before each Vestry Meeting for one year as an experiment. The system was commenced with the new Vestry after the Ward Elections in May, and while it has involved a considerable amount of extra work upon the staff, has been of great convenience to the members of the Board, who, by having the subjects of the business to be brought forward at the Board in their hands on the previous day, have been enabled to bring to bear upon the several questions a larger amount of personal deliberation and consideration than could otherwise have been the case, with results which cannot but be beneficial to the Parish generally. The cost of the printing of the Minutes is about £70 per annum. Note.—So well were the Vestry satisfied of the convenience and advantage of having the minutes and report printed that at the expiration of the first year's trial they resolved to continue it. 24 Meetings.—The following is the number of Meetings of the Vestry and the various Committees held during the year:— Board 43 Committee of Works including Sub-Committees 54 Sanitary Committee 17 Assessment Committee 10 Finance Committee 13 Parliamentary Committee 4 Special Committee 5 Lighting Committee 8 Committee of whole Board 1 Vestry Hall, Clerkenwell, ROBERT PAGET, August, 1882.

The Committee beg to present their Report, for the year ending on the 25th March last, of the operations and results of the system of doing the Dusting, Slopping, and Watering of the Parish by the Vestry's own staff. Dusting.—During the year there have been 7,765 loads of dust, and 345¼ loads of trade refuse removed. Slopping.—During the year there been 3,343 loads of street sweepings removed, 177 of which were collected late on Saturday nights. 40 Watering.—This was the first year in which the Vestry did its own street watering. Five additional horses were purchased for the sum of £350, making twenty-one in all; and twelve water vans were obtained for £559, and the Committee think that the way in which the work was done compared favourably with that of previous years, when the work was done by Contractors. Cartage.—In addition to the above, the Vestry's horses and carts have been largely employed during the year in carting stone, gully refuse, &c. Barges.—141 freights of ashes and breeze containing 8,952 chaldrons; 72 freights of slop, containing about 5,040 tons, and 30 freights of hard-core, containing about 1,500 tons, have been sent away from the wharf during the year. The average price obtained for the ashes and breeze was 2/2 per chaldron. 45 freights of slop were taken away free; £15 10s. was paid by the Vestry for the removal of 17 freights; and £10 was received for 10 freights. Of the 30 freights of hard-core, 26 were taken away free; £1 was paid for the removal of one, and £3 10s. received for three. In August, one of the horses, purchased in April of Mr. Russell, died, after an illness of some weeks, but no purchase has been made to fill its place. Four carts, and the van exhibited by Messrs. Hayes & Son at the Cattle Show, have been purchased during the year. The carts cost £25 each, and the van £52. The horses, carts, &c., belonging to the Vestry on the 25th March were as follows:— 20 horses, 11 vans, 10 carts, 12 water vans. 41 The following expenditure in plant, &c., has been made during the year:— PLANT AND OTHER PRELIMINARY EXPENSES. £ s. d. £ s. d.

The Committee, however, hope that this difference will be further decreased at the end of the current year by a decrease in the price of fodder, and by the fact that, whereas the average selling price of ashes and breeze was last year 2/2, Mr. Gore has, this year made arrangements to sell several thousand chaldrons at 2/10 and 3/- All which your Committee beg to submit.

Gentlemen, I have the honour of laying before you my 26th Annual Report, viz.:—That for the year 1881. The number of deaths arising from all causes in Clerkenwell, during the year 1880, was 1254. The annual average of the last ten years was 1384, so that the deaths were 130 less than the average. The deaths in 1880 having been 1313, those in 1881 were 59 less than in the preceding year. The accompanying table exhibits the number of deaths which have taken place in each of the last ten years, the births in each year being placed opposite:— 52  Deaths. Births. 1872 1,323 2,353 1873 1,513 2,664 1874 1,417 2,565 1875 1,539 2,505 1876 1,342 2,559 1877 1,385 2,522 1878 1,303 2,590 1879 1,456 2,667 1880 1,313 2,430 1881 1,254 2,414 The births were thus 16 less than in the preceding year, and 112 less than the average. According to the Registrar-General's sub-districts in which the births and deaths occurred, they stand thus:— deaths. births. excess. St. James 346 625 279 Amwell 362 646 284 Pentonville 251 531 280 Goswell 295 612 317 In each year, a number of the deaths of the parishioners takes place in general and special Hospitals, and in Lunatic Asylums. The estimated number of these for 1881 is 107. The number of births having been 2,414, and of deaths 1,254, the excess or the natural increase of population is 1,160. » The number of deaths arising from the principal zymotic diseases in 1881, was 240; being 5 less than in the preceding year. The number and the causes of deaths taking place from these principal zymotic diseases in Clerkenwell during the last ten years, are exhibited in the subjoined table:— 53  small pox. measles. scarlet fever. hooping cough. typhus. diarrhoea. totals. 1872 15 35 20 105 76 23 274 1873 0 48 13 49 29 95 234 1874 2 63 71 38 31 55 260 1875 2 36 76 82 24 58 278 1876 2 48 34 41 12 73 210 1877 15 73 82 36 25 53 284 1878 1 39 41 56 25 73 235 1879 1 77 44 61 11 36 227 1880 2 26 51 87 14 65 245 1881 10 39 54 53 26 58 240 The average number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases during the past ten years, was 248; so that the number for 1881 is 8 below the average. The number of deaths arising from all diseases in infants under 1 year of age was 368; 57 less than in the preceding year. 205 deaths occurred at and above 60; 22 less than in the preceding year. 119 inquest-deaths were registered in the year, being 12 more than in 1880. 54 8 deaths took place in the House of Correction; 6 in the House of Detention. 41 deaths arose from violence; the number for 1880 being 38. The numbers for the last four years were 40, 43, 38, and 41, so that the number for this year is the average. But when it is recollected that these deaths arise from accident, negligence, and suicide, and immediately from fractures and contusions, cuts, burns and scalds (want of fire-guards), over-lying and suffocation of infants in bed, children hanging behind vehicles and being run over, it is evident that they are mostly preventible and could be considerably reduced by ordinary care; and it must be remembered that many cases also occur which are not fatal. Hence the mortality of the year has been considerably below the average. It amounted to 18 per 1,000; if the persons dying in hospitals, &c., be added, the mortality would amount to 19 per 1,000. In 20 large English towns, the mortality in 1881 was:— London, 21.2; Brighton, 19; Portsmouth, 19.7; Norwich, 19.5; Plymouth, 19.9; Bristol, 19.6; Wolverhampton, 21.2; Birmingham, 20; Leicester, 21.8; Nottingham, 22.4; Liverpool, 25.7; Manchester, 25.5; Salford, 22.6; Oldham, 22.8; Bradford, 19.7; Leeds, 21.6; Sheffield, 21.1; Hull, 23.8; Sunderland, 21.0; and Newcastle-on-Tyne, 21.8. The mortality in all London was 21.2; that of the West districts, 19.5; of the North districts, 20.6; of the Central districts, 23; of the East districts, 24.2; and of the South districts, 20.4. The mortality of the year 1881, has thus been below the average; and in fact, below that of any year since the foundation of the Vestry. And the so recently taken Census assures us that this does not arise from a diminution of the population, which was found to have decidedly increased. 55 The number of deaths from zymotic diseases has been somewhat less than last year, and less than the average. And these are the diseases which are most amenable to Sanitary treatment, and to which the powers of the Vestry are mainly directed. The most noticeable feature in the mortality, is that of an increase of deaths from Small Pox. This disease prevailed epidemically in the Metropolis (2371 deaths), as it did in 1877 (2544 deaths), and in 1871 (7876 deaths). 170 cases are known to have occurred in the Parish, many of which were removed by the Guardians. In all instances, when it was known to occur, disinfectants were used until the removal or recovery of the patients, when the rooms were thoroughly disinfected. 8 of the deaths included under Scarlet Fever, are returned as having occurred from Diphtheria. And of the 26 deaths included under Typhus, 1 was registered as arising from Typhus proper; 23 from Typhoid ; and 2 from continued Fever. Slaughter-houses.—These were inspected by the Sanitary Committee and myself in November. They were 16; 7 in the Upper Wards, 9 in the lower, and were in very good order; the only defects noticed relating to imperfect cementing and paving. Cow-houses.—These were also inspected at the same time. They were 19; 11 in the upper Wards, and 8 in the lower. The cows numbered 272; 136 in each district. With the exception of a requirement of lime-whiting in a few cases, they were found to be in excellent order. The cows were very fine animals, and in excellent health and condition. Bake houses.—These were not inspected in 1880, but were inspected in September. 1881. They were 62; 30 in the upper Wards, 32 in the lower. They were mostly in good order, the principal defects being the traps out of order, the lime-whiting defective; in some cases it had avowedly not been done for twelve months. 56 Opposition was offered in two or three instances to the Vestry inspection of the bake houses, at the suggestion of Mr. Lakeman, the Government Inspector under the "Factory Act," 1878, who told the bakers to refuse the Vestry admission. Admission was, however, granted, and they were all inspected. It should be noted that the "Bake House Regulation Act," 1863, is repealed by the "Factory Act." In regard to bake houses, a newspaper copy of a sensational and erroneus report, by the Factory Inspector, on the London Bake-houses, has been recently circulated, describing them as being in a terrible state, with open drains, animals kept therein, untrapped closets and beds being also met with. The underground position of the bake-houses, which necessitates a certain deficiency of light and ventilation, being also noticed. The Government Inspector's Report was so generally expressed, that his remarks apparently applied to all the London bake houses. I can however assure the public, that no such Sanitary nuisances exist in the bake houses of Clerkenwell. Moreover, under the 4th Section of the Factory Act, tho Inspector is bound to give notice to the Yestry, of Sanitary neglect or default in auy factory or workshop; and it becomes the duty of the Sanitary authority to remedy tho same. But no such notice has been given to the Sanitary authority. Therefore we may fairly conclude that no Sanitary defaults have been found in our bake houses by tho Government Inspector; and we know from our own inspection in September last, that they did not exist. Mortuary.—The Mortuary Keeper's return shows that 232 bodies were received at the Mortuary during the year; 99 of these were brought for inquest purposes, upon which 43 postmortems were made; while 133 were received from houses of tho parishioners, where the corpses would othorwise have remained in living rooms. 57 The Meteorology of the year was as follows :— 1881. Temperature, Average. Difference from average of 110 years Dew-point. Humidity (Saturation = 100.) Height of Barometer. Rain in inches. Difference from average of 40 years. Year 48.7 +0.2 43 81 29.77 25.24 —0.02 Winter Quarter (Jan., Feb.. March) 37.3 —1.4 33.0 84 29.70 5.43 +0.42 Spring Quarter (April, May, June) 52.9 +0.6 44.1 72 29.83 4.10 —1.64 Summer Quarter (July, Aug., Sept.) 60.0 +0.3 53.8 79 29.76 8.19 +0.75 Autumn Quarter (Oct., Nov., Dec.) 44.6 +1.2 41.0 88 29.81 7.52 +0.38 Hence the mean temperature of the whole year, was slightly above the average; that of the winter quarter being below, and that of the Spring, Summer, and Autumn quarters being above the same. The amount of rain was almost exactly the average. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, J. W. GRIFFITH, M.D., Member Royal College of Physicians. June 3rd, 1882.

"The Clerk called attention to the fact that since “theVestry had ceased to collect the Poor Bate, which "duty had reverted to the Guardians or Governors of “the Poor under the Local Act, and which Board had been revived for the purpose in November, 1871,. u there was no Poor-rate Account published, except u the remainder of those in collection by theVestry “previous to that time, and suggested whether it would "not be desirable, by an agreement between both " Boards, to publish the Poor Eate Account of the " Guardians or Governors as an appendix to the Annual "Beports of theVestry, in which case there would be u one and a half years' Poor Eate Account to be u appended to the Ecport about to be issued for the 11 year ended Lady-day last.

(Required by the Metropolitan Board of Works for Parliamentary purposes.) ORDERED TO BE PRINTED MARCH 21, 1872, AND DECEMBER 1874. LONDON: GOODE & Co., PRINTERS, SEKFORDE ST., CLERKENWELL, E.C. 1874. [Copy.] METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Spring Gardens, 1st August, 1870. Dear Sir, You are doubtless aware that it was determined by the House of Commons to refer the Municipal Boroughs (Metropolis) Bill to a Select Committee, and it was supposed that a similar course would probably be adopted with regard to the two other Bills introduced by Mr. Buxton, viz., the Corporation of London Bill and the County of London Bill. The last two Bills have however been withdrawn from the consideration of Parliament for this Session, and there is therefore no probability of any enquiry before a Select Committee taking place this year. The Government have, however, determined to take the subject into consideration, and the Home Secretary, on the occasion of the interview which the Board had with him some weeks ago, expressed a wish that the Board should assist the Government by presenting to them the result of thoir experience with regard to the Local Government of the Metropolis since the Act of 1855 came into operation, with a view to enable them to consider how the present system has workod, and what improvements appear to be called for. It has occured to the Board's Parliamentary Committee that it would be useful to show what the Board and the various Vestries and District Boards have effected in the way of Sanitary and street improvements during the period of their existence, and by this means to rebut the allegations that have been freely made as to want of energy on the part of the Local Authorities of tho Metropolis, and indifference to the interests entrusted to them. For this purpose, I am directed to request that you will bo good enough to answer tho questions on the accompanying paper, and return the same to mo at your early convenience. I am, Doar sir, Yours faithfully, JOHN POLLARD, Clerk of the Board. ROBERT PAGET, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Clerkenwell.

Q.— No. 8.— What part Of this A.— No increase has taken place increase has been occasioned since 1856. by the abolition of Turnpike Tolls ? [Toll-gates in this parish were abolished many years ago (in 1830), since which time four roads, formerly turnpike roads, viz., Pentonville Road, Saint John Street Road, Goswell Road, and Bagnigge Wells Road (now King's Cross Road), have been maintained by the Parish. 8 Q.— No. 9.— What regulations existed with regard to the inspection and improvements of Courts, Alleys, and Dwellings, and for Lighting and Paving in your Parish or District in 1856, and what are the regulations now in force ? Q.— No. 10.— How many additional Street Lamps have been put up since 1856 ? Q.— No. 11.— What is the Sanitary and general condition of the Parish compared with what it was before 1856? A.— The regulations for the inspection and improvement of Courts, &c., in 1856, were as now, except that of inspection and improvement of Dwellings. The Local Management Act has given theVestry power to inspect houses and cause the abatement of nuisances where any exist, and the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act gives theVestry power to condemn dilapidated dwellings, &c. A.— Forty-one. A.— This question may be answered in two ways, either by assuming the general rate of mortality, and that resulting from zymotic diseases (which are specially considered to represent the sanitary or unsanitary state of a Parish) as a standard; or considering the number of noxious influences remaining or removed during the interval under consideration. Unfortunately, the first form of answer is very difficult of application to the case of Clerkenwell Parish— for so many houses have been palled down, and others re-built, that we have no exact knowledge of the number of inhabitants. 9 Between 1856 and 1861, a large number of houses were pulled down in the Parish, and very few re-built, so that, in 1861, the inhabitants had only increased by 927; since that period, the Corporation Buildings and the Cobden Buildings have been erected, adding alone about 1000 inhabitants, and other houses have been built. The only approximate comparison that can be made, is to ascertain the per centage of deaths in 1856 from the latter and the Census of 1851, and that of the deaths in 1869, in reference to the Census of 1861. Between the years 1851 and 1861, the population had increased only 927— 92.7 per annum. If 5 years increase (1851 to 1856) be added as the increase, the population becomes 65,168 for 1856. 1313 deaths in this population is— 2.01 (for 1856). The population at the Census of 1861, was 65,632 ; adding 8 years increase at the former rate, the population becomes 66,373 for 1869. The deaths being 1512, the death rate is 2.2 per cent., so that, in this calculation the death rate has somewhat increased, still, considering the increased number of births, the population will probably be found to have increased in a greater ratio than this. If the Scarlet Fever, which has been for some time so prevalent and fatal, may be regarded as a standard of good sanitation, the number of deaths occurring from that disease in this and a few other Parishes may be compared. During the year 1869 the deaths to 100,000 persons living, were in Clerkenwell, 164; Holborn, 209; St. Luke's, 278; St. George, Hanover Square, 48; Lewisham, 49; Hackney, 231; Bethnal Green, 365; Bermondsey, 386 ; &c. That the general condition and management of the Parish has been vastly improved, will be seen at once from the answer to question 3, where a list of the sanitary works which have been effected is given. Water Supply. The water supply has been greatly improved since 1856. In addition to the filtering works, and enclosed in tubes of the New River, all the old obnoxious stand-pipes have been done away with. In every court there is always a supply of water at all times. All the shallow and other public wells and pumps have been done away with or locked. And all, or nearly all, for we believe only one remains, of the underground cisterns are destroyed 10 The Courts and Alleys are regularly inspected at least twice a-week, to see that no nuisances exist, and that the dust bins are regularly emptied. In the warn weather the footways and closets are flushed with disinfectants (carbolic acid) . When epidemic fever is prevailing, or when death has been known to occnr from this the premises are inspected and cleansed; and particular care is taken that no family removes from an apartment where there has been infectious disease, until the clothes, &c., have been fumigated; and no tenement is re-let until it has been fumigated, limewhited, and thoroughly cleansed. A Mortuary has been provided to hold the bodies of those found dead, or of those whose families occupy but a single room in which also post-mortems are conducted. The bodies of those dying in the work-house are at once conveyed here, and left until the time of burial. Fever Conveyance. A Carriage is kept, and solely used to convey those suffering from Small Pox or Fever, to the respective Hospitals. Analyst of Pood. The Medical-Officer of Health was appointed Analyst of Food. But as there was no fund to pay the expenses and the risk of costs on appeal was great, the appointment was not re-made. Nor did the public take advantage of the proposed benefits. Complaints. Complaints may be, and very frequently are entered in a book. These are at once attended to and the necessary orders made for the removal of the nuisances which gave rise to them. Cow-houses, &C. The Cow-houses, Slaughter-houses, and the. Bake-houses, are regularly inspected prior to the licensing (of the 2 former), and all necessary improvements are ordered and carried out. Burials. All burials have long ceased in the Parish, and all coffins in the vaults have been buried with disinfectants, and all communication between them and the interior of the Church has been prevented. 11 Underground Kitchens, litany of those have been emptied find are no longer used. But it cannot be said, by far, that all which would come within the Act have been closed. The ground that there would not be really sufficient accommodation for the people if this were done. Trade Nuisances. Many trade nuisances have been removed or abated, often at considerable expanse by the proprietors. Zinc Works, Fat Melters, India-rubber Works, Smoke Nuisances, &c., have either been removed from the district, or so improved as to cease to form ground of complaint. Pigs are not allowed to be kept in the Parish. Urinals. 13 urinals have been constructed since the existence of the Vestry; both for the accommodation of the public and to prevent the secretions from becoming a nuisance. Lodging-houses. The occupation of numerous tenements as lodging-houses, has been prevented by reference to the Police. And overcrowding has in many eases been prevented by serving notices, &c. Vaccination. Before the passing of the last Vaccination Act, hand bills were distributed and freely posted, shewing the residences and times of attendance of the Vaccinators, and pointing out the importance of vaccination. Artizans' Dwellings Act. The Artizans' Dwellings Act has been brought into play; some houses having pulled down and re-built. The Workshop Regulation Act.— Hand-bills detailing the powers of this Act, have been freely distributed and posted. And in answer to numerous complaints, the employers have been called upon and threatened, until the force of the law was felt and obeyed Drainage,— The improvements in drainage in the parish have been very large. The number of cesspools removed each year has boon as follows:— In 1856, 236; 1857, 386; 1858, 171; 1859, 151; 1860, 119; 1861,45; 1862,76; 1863,36; 1864,30; 1865, 27; 1866, 38; 1867, 19; 1868, 12 ; 1869, 13. 12 The Medical Officer of Health attends daily at the Vestry to inspect any promises, or to advise the Inspectors; and being Physician to a large Public Charity, which post he has hold for nearly 30 years, including the whole of the parish, where the patients are visited at home, he has numerous opportunities of viewing apartments and premises which might otherwise escape notice. During the period in question, many of the poorer houses have been pulled down, and some bettor houses and factories built. But on the whole, it is probable that the poorer houses have been considerably diminished in number: the poorer class often now occupying one or two rooms as a tenement in the remaining better houses, whoso former occupants live out of town. Hence on the whole, the inhabitants are more crowded than formerly; and this condition renders it impossible to prevent the spread of (and so the mortality from) zymotic diseases without the early removal and complete isolation of the infected from the healthy; which to be effective, must bo done in other parishes as well as this. Br Order, ROBERT PAGET, Vestry Clerk. Vbstry Hall, Clerkenwll, March 9th, 1672. CONTINUATION TO LADY-DAY, 1874. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Spring Gardens, 20th October, 1874. Sir, In the year 1871 you were good enough to furnish the Board with some statistics of the works carried out in your District since the Metropolis Local Management Act 1855, came into operation. At that time the attention of Parliament had been recently directed to the Local Government of the Metropolis by the Bills on the subject introduced by the late Mr. Charles Buxton. The Board's object in obtaining the information was to show the Legislature and the Government in a short and summary form the general results of the action of the local authorities constituted [under the Act of 1855, as exhibited in the improved condition of the various districts. Mr. Buxton's Bills, as you are aware, were not proceeded with, but the Board having obtained the necessary information from the Local Boards, submitted it in the shape of a return to Parliament, a copy of which was at the same time sent for the information of your Board. The question of the Local Government of the Metropolis is, it would appear, again to be brought under the notice of the House of Commons in the coming Sessions, and the Board in view of this, wishes to be prepared with complete statistics of the whole of the works executed by the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis from 1st January 1856 to 25th March, 1874. I have accordingly to ask that your Board will be good enough to direct that I may be furnished by the 1st December next, with the information required, which would be most conveniently done by filling up the columns on the other side of this letter. Ton will perceive that what is now asked for is not so extensive as the information which you were good enough to furnish in 1871. You then gave in addition to the statistics of work done, a description of the improved condition of your district at that time as compared with its condition in 1856, together with certain other information which is still sufficiently applicable to render it unnecessary to trouble you for any further account. It is hoped that you will not find much difficulty in supplying the information now required by the time named, viz., the 1st December next. I am, Sir, Yonr obedient Servant, (Signed) J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk of the Board. To the Clerk of the Vestry of Clerkenwell. Miles. Yards.

A Mortuary to which the bodies of the dead could bo removed from among the crowded poor, and where post-mortems may be conducted, which was found to be much needed, was provided in 1866 at a cost of £180, but in 1874 the Mortuary was removed, the London School Board having purchased the ground on which it stood for School purposes. 17 Q.—No. 3.—Total superficial Area of Paving laid down from from January, 1856 to 25th March, 1874?
