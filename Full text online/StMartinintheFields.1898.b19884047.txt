To the Vestry of St. Martin-tn-the-Fields. Mr Lord, Madam, and Gentlemen, I have the honour of submitting to you my Twentyninth Annual Report on the health and sanitary condition of the Parish. Births. The Births registered during the year numbered 182, an increase of 7 over the previous year, 1897. a 2 The followiug Table gives the number of Births registered in each month of the year :— Males.

Iu London the birth-rate for the year 1898 was 29*5 per 1,000. Deaths. The total Deaths registered in the Parish during the year 1898 were 305, an increase of 8 over the previous year. * To these 179 Births occurring in the Parish must be added 3 belonging to St. Martin's which took place at the Bear i'ard Receiving Ward, making a total of 182. 3 The following Table gives the number of deaths registered iu each month of the year:— Males. Females. Total. January 13 11 24 February 8 5 13 March 19 12 31 April 14 8 22 May 15 7 22 June 22 4 26 July 20 9 29 August 17 19 36 September 16 10 26 October 11 8 19 November 28 11 39 December 9 9 18 192 113 305 These 305 deaths include those non-parishioners who died iu the Charing Cross Hospital, and must therefore be omitted in estimating the death-rate, but, on the other hand, the deaths occurring in Public Institutions outside the Parish of persons belonging thereto must be added. The death-rate of the Parish for the year 1898 is 14.4 per 1,000. In London, the deaths in the year 1898 numbered 83,936, and corresponded to a rate of 18.7 per 1,000 of the population, the average death-rate in the previous ten years having been 19.7. Infantile Mortality. Of the 188 deaths of parishioners occurring within and outside the Parish, 32 were under 5 years of age, equal to 17 0 per cent, of the total deaths. a 2 4 The deaths of Infants under 1 year of age numbered 26, equal to 13-8 per cent, of the total deaths, and 142*9 to 1,000 registered births. In London, during the year 1898, the deaths of Infants under 1 year of age to 1,000 births were 167. The following Table shows the causes of death of these 26 infants under 1 year of age:— Atrophy and Debility 2 Diseases of Respiratory System 5 Diseases of Digestive System 4 Premature Birth 5 Scarlet Fever 1 Diarrhœa 4 Congenital Syphilis 2 Tabes Mesenterica 1 Atelectasis 1 Suffocation 1 26 Old Age Mortality. The deaths of parishioners over 60 years of age, occurring within and out of the Parish, were 66. 26 were from 60 to 70 years of age. 29 „ „ 70 „ 80 „ 11 „ „ 80 „ 90 „ Causes of Death. Zymotic Diseases.— The principal Zymotic Diseases are Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever, Puerperal Fever, Cholera, and Diarrhœa. 5 The number of deaths occurring in the Parish from this class of disease was 22. This number includes those nonparishioners who died in the Charing Cross Hospital. After deducting these, and adding those parishioners who died in Public Institutions outside the Parish, the mortality due to St. Martin's would be 11, against 15 of the previous year, 1897. Vide Table 5. Small-Pox.— No case was notified from this disease. In London, during 1898, only one death was recorded from Small-pox. Measles.— One death from this disease occurred in the Strand Buildings, and one of a non-parishioner in Charing Cross Hospital. Scarlet Fever.— One death from Scarlet Fever of an infant belonging to St. Martin's occurred at the Western Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Diphtheria.— Two deaths from this disease occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, one of which was a non-parishioner, and two of parishioners iu the Hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, making a total of three to the credit of St. Martin's. Whooping Cough.— One death of a non-parishioner occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, and one in Cross Court, Broad Court. Typhoid Fever.— Nine deaths from this complaint occurred in the Charing Cross Hospital, all of which were non-parishioners, and one at the Hotel Cecil. In this latter case, the patient was suffering from the complaint when he arrived at the hotel from Italy, and died five days afterwards. Also a death of a parishioner occurred from this malady at St. George's Hospital. Typhus Fevee.— No death was recorded from this complaint. 6 Diarrhoea.— Six deaths from Diarrhoea occurred in the Parish, of which three were non-parishioners occurring in the Charing Cross Hospital, and there was one death of a parishioner from this complaint in the Westminster Hospital. Inquests. During the year 1898, inquests were held in the Parish in reference to the deaths of 52 persons, of whom 19 were residents, and also 6 inquests were held respecting the deaths of parishioners outside the Parish. The causes which produced death were as follows:— Natural causes 24 Poison, Hydrochloric Acid (suicide) 1 4 ,, Sulphate of Zinc (suicide) 1 ,, Morphia (accidental) 1 „ Prussic Acid (accidental 1 Pistol Shot Wound (suicide) 2 Hanging (suicide) 1 Drowning 2 Suffocation from pressure, newly born 1 2 ,, infant, when in bed with mother 1 Haemorrhage from navel cord, newly born 1 Exposure and want of attention, newly born 1 Injuries received from falling down stairs or steps 4 Injuries received from fall from window 2 „ „ „ „ flies on to the stage of a theatre 1 Injuries received from being run over by a railway train 1 Injuries received from jumping out of a cart 1 „ to neck (suicide) 1 7 Inquests— continued. Rupture of a blood-vessel during a boxing contest 1 Injuries from an illegal operation 1 „ received from being run over or knocked down by vehicles in the street. 8 Cause not specified 1 58 Notification of Infectious Disease. During the year 1898 the number of cases of infectious disease notified in accordance with The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was 38, as against 81 of the previous year. On referring to Table 10 the diseases will be found specified, and the localities wherein the cases occurred. The fees paid to the Medical Practitioners for forwarding the notifications of these 38 cases amounted to £3 12s. 6d., which sum is refunded to your Vestry by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Disinfection after Infectious Disease. During the year 38 rooms and the contents thereof were disinfected by your Contractor, at a cost of £55 8s. Id. Antitoxin. In the latter part of the year I received a communication from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board offering to supply antitoxin for the treatment of those cases of Diphtheria which are unable to be admitted into the Board's hospitals in times of great pressure. The following is a copy of the letter:— 8 Metropolitan Asylums Board, Norfolk House, Norfolk Street, Strand, 16th November, 1898. Dear Sir, Supply of Antitoxin. In my circular letter of the 21st December, 1897, to the several Medical Officers of Health in the metropolitan district, I indicated generally the steps which the Managers would be prepared to take with a view of accelerating the distribution of antitoxin sel'um in the event of pressure upon the Board's accommodation again necessitating the temporary refusal of Diphtheria cases. As there is, unfortunately, reason to anticipate that this emergency may arise at no distant date, and assuming that you will be willing to receive and distribute the serum in the manner proposed in my circular letter, I am directed to inform you that a supply of not exceeding five doses of 4,000 units each, with directions as to use, may be obtained from the laboratories at the Examination Hall of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, Victoria Embankment, W.C., upon application being made to the Director, Dr. Sims Woodhead, by messenger bearing your order upon one of the enclosed forms. Before you give out the serum, I shall be glad if you will obtain the signature of the medical practitioner to a certificate similar to that at the foot of the enclosed printed warrant, a number of copies of which are enclosed. These warrants must be preserved and forwarded to me at the end of each quarter, and when your supply of serum or warrants is nearing exhaustion, application should be made to the laboratories by messenger for a fresh supply upon the form first mentioned. I am advised that the serum should not be used after it has been kept in stock three months. It must be distinctly understood that the stock forwarded to you is to be used only for patients who are awaiting admission into the Board's hospitals. As it is still the Managers' intention to- forward a warrant to the medical practitioner concerned immediately it is ascertained 9 that a diphtheria patient cannot be admitted, instances will probably arise in which application for the removal of a patient to hospital will have been made to the Board before the occurrence of the case is brought to your notice, and in which the medical attendant will already have been furnished with a warrant for the supply of the serum. It will therefore be advisable for inquiry to be made in every case as to whether or not applicants are already in possession of the serum or a warrant for its supply. If not, you or your representative could at once supply the serum in exchange for the warrant, without issuing one of the warrants in your possession. Yours faithfully, T. DUNCOMBE MANN. Clerk to the Board. To Dr. ./. J. Slcegg, Medical Officer of Health, St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Happily, up to the present time (April. 1899) there has been no necessity for applying for a supply of antitoxin, as cases of Diphtheria have been readily admitted to the Board's hospitals.

The net gain in life saved during 1898 is represented by 4,506 lives. In other words, had the average death-rate m 1888-97 continued throughout the year under present notice, 4,506 lives would have been sacrificed in addition to those which have been actually lost by death. In the year 1898 there was, as compared with the decennial average, an excess of 306 deaths from measles, 145 from influenza, 1.408 from diarrhoeal diseases, 543 from cancer, 193 from premature birth, 88 from urinary diseases, 135 from accident, and 1 from homicide. Under each of the other headings in the table the mortality in 1898 was below the average. This was notably the case in regard to scarlet fever, whooping-cough, diphtheria and phthisis, and also in regard to diseases of the nervous and of the respiratory system—the deaths referred to the last-mentioned group of diseases being 3,810 below the animal average.
