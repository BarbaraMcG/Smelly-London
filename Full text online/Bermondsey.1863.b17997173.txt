The several open and covered sewers under the Vestry's control have been periodically flushed, or the contents removed when found necessary. HOUSE DRAINAGE. Fifty-three applications for permission to connect branch drains with the public sewers have been received and granted, by which means the drainage of 94 houses and premises has been effected. ERECTION OF HOUSES AND BUILDINGS. The Vestry have received notices of intention to erect 295 houses and premises in the Parish, and have caused the provisions of the Act with respeGt to the drainage of the houses, where it could be carried out, and water supply, to be observed. SANITARY MEASURES AND REMOVAL OF NUISANCES. The Report of the Medical Officer of Health, is annexed hereto as required by the Amendment Act, and contains tabular statements, showing the sanitary condition of the Parish during the year, and also a statement of the nuisances which the Board have caused to be removed in the same period. The sanitary condition of the Parish being the most important duty devolving upon the Vestry, their most careful consideration continues to be directed to it, and the Vestry cannot too strongly urge upon the inhabitants to aid them therein, by making them, or their officers acquainted with the existence of any nuisance which may arise in the Parish. LIGHTING. The number of the public lamps in the Parish is now 640, viz.— Surrey Gas Company's district 425 South Metropolitan Gas Company's district 153 Phœenix Gas Company's district 62 640 Five additional lamps have been provided during the year, and the positions of several altered for the better lighting of the district. The annual charge for lighting, extinguishing, cleansing, painting and repairing each lamp is £4 5s. CLEANSING AND DUSTING. In the sweeping of the streets, the Vestry has during the year, as in previous years, co-operated with the Guardians of the Poor in employing persons, applicants for relief from the Poor's Rate, but with the view to secure this work being done more efficiently, have directed a limited number of able-bodied laborers to be employed in addition during the approaching Winter. The dust as heretofore, has been collected by men employed by the Vestry, and then sold to Mr. Wood for the sum of £3 6s. 8d. per 100 loads. The Vestry continue anxious to keep the dwellings of the inhabitants free from dust and decomposing matter, and solicit the parishioners to make known at the Vestry Office any neglect of the dustmen to remove the refuse. WATERING. The streets as heretofore were watered by 6 water carts during the season. PAVING. The Vestry have caused the following streets, comprising carriageways and footpaths to be repaved, viz.:— Feet in Length. Superl. Yards. Cost per Yard. Total Cost. £ s. d. — — s. d. Salisbury Street:—New Edge Curb, part old Curb relaid, Granite Carriageway relaid, New York and part old York 2 5¾ 1270 470 157 8 9 George Row:— Portion of Footpath on west side paved with new York, and Curb relaid 118 5 4 193 31 9 3 Mill Street:— Five-feetway paved with new York 91 5 6 162 25 1 8 The Macadamized Roads and Footways in the Parish have been newly-coated with material from time to time as occasion required. In addition to the above the whole of the Footways and paved Carriageways under the control of the Board have been kept in repair. The Vestry have also, under the powers conferred upon them by the Act, served notices upon the Owners of the following Streets and Places, to pave the same, and upon such owners arranging to pay the cost thereof the Vestry have paved and repaired such places, viz:— Feet in Length. Superl. Yards. Cost per Yard. Total Cost.

SCAFFOLDS. 61 Licenses to put up Scaffolds and Hoardings were granted during the year, the Pavement was relaid and made good after at the expense of the applicant.. ST. THOMAS'S HOSPITAL. The projected removal of this valuable institution out of South wark has been a source of great anxiety to the Vestry, and in order more fully to acquaint the parishioners with the steps that have been taken in the matter, the Vestry annex hereto a copy of the Report of the Committee of Parishes thereon, REPORT. To the Vestries, Boards of Works and Boards of Guardians of Metropolitan Parishes South of the Thames. Gentlemen, In November, 1862, it was brought to the notice of St. George's Vestry, and subsequently before other Vestries and Boards of this vicinity, that the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital contemplated removing that great and valuable charity far away from the poor people who had up to that time enjoyed its benefits. The press and the medical staff of the Hospital almost without exception resisted this, as a very ill advised step. The Governors, however persisted. At a meeting of St. George's Vestry, Nov. 17th, the following resolution was passed, " That it be recommended to the other Vestries, and to the respective district boards, and the boards of Guardians on this side of the Thames, to combine with this A Vestry and form forthwith a Committee, to consist of one member of each Vestry or Board; for the purpose of printing such papers relating to the above subject as they may deem advisable, employing Counsel; and generally to take such measures as may be found necessary for preventing the removal of St. Thomas's Hospital from this vicinity. The expenses of this Committee to be jointly borne by the parishes and districts represented." A Committee was accordingly formed consisting of the following Gentlemen, appointed by the respective Vestries and Boards, for the purposes named in the resolution. Vestry of St George the Martyr W. Rendle, Esq. Guardians T. Park, Esq. Vestry of Bermondsey W. Darnell, Esq. Guardians J. Harris, Esq. Vestry of Newington H. R. Sylvester, Esq. Guardians E. Evans, Esq. Vestry of Camberwell F. W. Denny, Esq. Guardians G. S. Freeman, Esq. Vestry of Lambeth J. W. Stratton, Esq. Guardians M. Goddard, Esq. Vestry of Rotherhithe J. W. Barrett, Esq. Guardians E. G. Dannell, Esq. Vestry of St. Saviour's J. E. Newsom, Esq. Vestry of St. John's J. D. Neale, Esq. These Gentlemen have all acted together with the greatest cordiality; there has scarcely ever been any difference of opinion, and when in September, 1863, in consequence of the probable selection of the Stangate site in Lambeth, the representatives of Lambeth were withdrawn, they both, on withdrawing, stated their conviction, that a central position, suitable equally to Southwark, Newington, Camberwell, Peckham and Lambeth, would be much better than the Stangate site. The Hospital, it is well known, was founded as " the House of the Poor in Southwark," in 1553; but it is not so well known that it appears to have had its origin within the precincts of the priory of St. Mary Overy, where was a building expressly "for the use of the poor." In 1213, this building was destroyed by fire; and in the same year was erected a building "for converts and poor children," on the priory ground at Bermondsey. After this the Bishop of Winchester united the two; and selected, en account of its pure air and water, the spot where the late Hospital was. He dedicated the new Hospital to St. Thomas the Martyr, and endowed it with £344 per year.* The antiquity of the institution, and the present pressing need, have been alike disregarded by some of the Governors ; who moreover appear to be entirely without popular confidence in almost all that they have done in the late proceedings. The Hospital will probably be rebuilt at Stangate; a site objectionable for many reasons, not suitable for Southwark, or the eastern and southern districts of the Borough of Lambeth; and still less suitable for the people of the City districts, who in 1861 appear to have furnished about one fourth of the in-patients. Notwithstanding this, the Committee congratulates the Parishes upon the abandonment of the contemplated scheme of placing St. Thomas's Hospital in the country: which scheme was not abandoned until the Committee had actively interfered. That it was intended by the Governors to obtain, if possible, a distant site for the Hospital, notwithstanding the assertions of some of them to the contrary, is evident. first, from the second clause of the St. Thomas's Hospital Act, 1862, wherein the Governors had insisted upon and obtained, the power to purchase land not exceeding fifty acres; it being of course known that no such quantity could be obtained in London, or its immediate suburbs and Second, the Governors having circulated officially, and formally recommended a pamphlet, entitled " What are the best situations for our Metropolitan Hospitals ?" In which pamphlet it is in one place stated, that our Hospitals "Should be in the first place at a distance from town ; " and indirectly, in another page, that such distance should be " certainly not within six miles of London Bridge." Thus we may see what we have escaped. Prior to the formal appointment of a standing Committee, the Parishes had been represented by deputations, one to Lord Redesdale, as the Chairman of Committees on private bills in the House of Lords. and one to a Committee of the House of Commons. Deputations of the Committee have had several interviews with the Governors of the Hospital. It was urged, firstly, that the Hospital should not be built out of London. and secondly, that the sites known as the Surrey Gardens, the ground behind Newington Church, and that occupied by Bethlem would either of them meet the wants of the localities, and satisfy the Parishes. It was also urged that the population of these localities at the time the Hospital was founded was probably under 20,000, and that now having increased to half a million, it was unreasonable to deprive them of a Charity relieving annually more than 40,000 poor people, and expending about £30,000. The Committee had also an interview with Earl Shaftesbury. His Lordship received them very graciously; he presented their petition to the House of Lords, and made a very energetic and admirable speech on the occasion. He urged, as Chairman of the Lunacy Commissioners, that Bethlem if removed into the country could maintain twice the number of patients at the present cost, and could admit patients much worse, and with fewer restrictions than is now done. A charitable citizen, Mr. H. W. Peek, had just before offered to give 70 acres of land near Croydon, admirably suited for the purpose : upon conditions, that Bethlem should be rebuilt there, —that St Thomas's should be rebuilt at Bethlem, —and that the value of the land should be handed over to the London Hospital, a very poor charity in the eastern outskirts of London, to which, if enlarged by this means, the large number of St. Thomas's patients north of the Thames, might have had convenient access. It moreover appeared to be quite within the scope of the St. Thomas's charter to have thus insured further Hospital aid to the poor of that part of London and its suburbs. This great opportunity was ill received, and was, strange as it may seem, allowed to pass away. When it is considered that 63 of the Governors of Bethlem Hospital, are also Governors of St. Thomas's the omission seems particularly ungracious, and indeed seems to fall very far short of the spirit of the charge devolving on them, " that they would be faithful and true distributors and dispensers of the goods of Almighty God to his poor and needy members." Mainning and Bray's Surrey, Vol. 3, pp. 614, 615. Phillips's History of Bermondsey, p. 34. folding's Historical Account of St. Thomas's Hospital, p. 15. MS. Notes by the late G. R. Corner, Esq. 1 Order of Hospitals, 1557. The Governors of Bethlem also received a deputation from the Committee appointed at the suggestion of the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital. But from what followed, the Committee is of opinion that the Governors had at the very time of this suggestion already made up their minds as to Stangate. In this, as in other of the interviews with the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital, it appears to the Committee that they were not frankly dealt with; not dealt with indeed as the representatives of public bodies, duly elected by a population of half a million, and representing great interests, were entitled to be dealt with by the managers of a great public trust. It almost appeared as if the managers of this great public trust deemed themselves virtually irresponsible. The Committee always feeling this, first took care to inform every individual Governor of their case and their opinion, and afterwards made an appeal to the City by memorial. The Committee was received by the Common Council with great courtesy, and the following resolution was carried unanimously. " Whereas St. Thomas's Hospital was originally founded at the cost of the Mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the city of London, in whose management it was vested by Royal Charter, and did so continue for two centuries; and whereas by a subsequent act of parliament, the Corporation is still required to take part in the government of the Hospital by appointing 38 members of its own body, to act as Governors in its behalf, this Court deems it needful at the present time to declare its opinion, that having regard to the local duties for which this great charity of St. Thomas's Hospital was originally founded, chartered, and endowed, and which have been fulfilled for three centuries, the new Hospital ought as far as circumstrnces permit, to be built in a situation no less central than that which the former Hospital occupied." This resolution was officially signed, and forwarded to the Governors of St. Thomas's Hospital. It was subsequent to this that the country scheme was definitely abandoned. It now became evident that although the country scheme was abandoned, the Governors would probably select some site very inconvenient for old Southwark and the city; at one time Myatts Ground, close to the Camberwell Station of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway; at another time and so finally fixed, Stangate on the Thames, or as the Committee might say, in it. It was now resolved again to memorialize the City. The Lord Mayor, by requisition extensively signed, called a Council at the Mansion House, specially to hear what the committee of parishes had to say. Mr. Lawley of the City, most ably stated the case; he was well supported by Mr. Deputy Elliot, and by other influential gentlemen. To these gentlemen, and to the City Solicitor, the Committee begs to tender its best thanks. The Committee was heard, and the result was, that the Common Council resolved to appear with the parishes, or for them, as the Attorney General might decide; ana accordingly at once retained Counsel. Subsequently, by appointment, the Attorney General received the representatives of the City, the Committee of parishes, and the Hospital officials. The Attorney General, after hearing all the parties concerned, decided, that as the City and the purishes evidently had but one object, and as the City had the better locus standi, the City might appear in the interest of both, before the Vicechancellor, in opposition to the Stangate site; and so to the satisfaction of the Committee it was decided. The City proceeded with energy, and employed the witnesses obtained by the parishes, as well as several others of the highest standing and character. The Vice-chancellor, Sir Page "Wood, decided for Stangate, stating that unless it was proved before him that the Governors of the Hospital had acted other than bona fide, he could not do otherwise. It was not in evidence before him, nor could it have been, that the Governors had acted in bad faith, notwithstanding in the opinion of this Committee, the action of the Governors throughout has been highly unsatisfactory; so much so indeed, that the Committee belie there is great and pressing need of an entire change in the government of this rich charity eertain passages in the Charity Commissioners' Report (32 part 6.) appear fully to bear out this opinion. It may be as well to cite here certain pertinent passages in the Vice-chancellor's judgment. He observes, on behalf of the parishes, that they appear to say, " Our poor were largely benefitted; we wish them to have the same benefits; we wish also as regards ourselves, wo being subjected to rates, that our poor shall not be thrown, as they will probably be, more upon our rates, if they have not the advantages of this Hospital; and we wish them to have all the same advantages they had before. The parishes raise this case, which seems to be quite reasonable"—and again " As regards the situation, I have no doubt this Hospital originally was intended for the benefit of persons among whom it was immediately placed. We have the charters to guide us in this matter , and it was intended originally for the benefit of those inhabiting the city of London; and ,those inhabiting Southwark. This was the original intention." And again, in the act "by imposing the term, that the approbation of the Court of Chancery should be obtained, and that the Attorney General should have notice of any application, it was intended that all persons who have any objections to the site that might be suggested should have a fair opportunity of being heard." These statements of the learned Judge fully justify the parishes in the proceedings they have taken to prevent this great charity from going astray; and the Committee feels that the time and trouble have not been thrown away, notwithstanding the Governors have, in the opinion of the Committee, chosen the smallest, most inconvenient, and most doubtful and experimental, of the selected sites. The gentlemen forming the Committee feel constrained to say, that whether they have succeeded in satisfying the parishes represented or not, they have endeavoured with as much patience and tact as they possessed, to do their" very best to secure the object of their appointment: that although Stangate may not so well suit the parishes and their poor, as some other of the specified sites; they feel a country _ site would have deprived them altogether of the benefit of the Hospital; and this at least, they believe they have prevented. They consider that the suggestion of branch receiving houses was mainly, perhaps only, put forth by the Governors with a view to a country site for the Hospital; and they therefore could not lend themselves at the time to this contrivance: but now assuming that the site is settled at Stangate, they consider that two such receiving houses and places for out-patients in the outlying districts, would be a great convenience to the poor, and would to that extent also relieve the parishes. Bermondsey and Rotherhithe require one, Camberwell and Newington another. The money can he spared, and not improbably may be spent in some architectural extravagance if not so used. In the course of the proceedings, it became necessary to employ a legal adviser ; and as the Committee resolved that it would be better for one gentleman only to act, Mr. Sturmy was appointed. Mr. Drew, of Bermondsey, in the kindest and most courteous manner, acceded to the arrangement. The Committee believes that the parishes could not have been better advised than they have been by Mr. Sturmy. The Committee considers it right also to acknowledge the courteous assistance of the Borough Members, especially of Mr. Locke, in public meetings and elsewhere. The attention of the Vestries and Boards concerned, is also called to the fact, that the Charity Commissioners are now conducting a public inquiry into tho foundation, object, endowment, and present circumstances of St. Thomas's Hospital, and as to what improvements may be made in the management thereof." The Committee thinks it might be well for the different bodies represented, to seek an interview, by deputation, with the Charity Inspectors. Among other objects of the interview, one might be to recommend one or two branch receiving houses or out-patients' Dispensaries, in the outlying districts, in connection with the Hospital; and to suggest the appointment of a representative for each Vestry south of the Thames, as a Governor of St. Thomas's Hospital. Signed, On behalf of the Committee of Parishes, WILLIAM RENDLE, Chairman. The Account of the Expenditure of the Committee is as under: — £ s. d. Solicitor's charges 75 14 7 Do. payments 55 9 7 £131 4 2 This Amount is divisible into seven parts, giving the sura of £18 14s. 10d. to be paid by each of the following Parishes and Boards: — The Parish of St. George the Martyr, „ Bermondsey, „ Newington, „ Camberwell, „ Rotherhithe, „ St. Saviour. The District Board of St. Olave's and St. John's. PARLIAMENTARY NOTICES. Parliamentary notices and plans were deposited, at the offices of the Board in November last, relative to the following Railway Bills, viz.: North and South London High Level Railways. London Union Railways. Metropolitan Grand Union Railway London, Brighton and South Coast Railway station enlargement. The Vestry drew the attention of the Metropolitan Board, whose duty it is to protect the interests of the public in such matters to the steps which m the opinion of the Vestry were necessary to be taken to preserve the rights of the inhabitants before such Bills became law, and now report that the three first Bills were not proceeded with by the promoters, that the fourth passed through Parliament, but will not affect any of the streets under the Board's jurisdiction. TOLL BARS IN THE PARISH. As the Lease of the Bermondsey, Rotherhithe and Deptford Trust will expire in 1865, the Vestry have deemed it right to aid the popular movement for the abolition of Turnpike Gates from the Metropolitan area, and will use its best exertions to prevent a renewal of the Lease of the Tolls in Bermondsey. Although an additional burden will be cast upon the Ratepayers by such a proceeding, the Vestry feel that the scheme for the general removal of Turnpikes will be essential to the convenience of the public at large, and should therefore receive their co-operation and support. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES, COW-HOUSES AND BAKE-HOUSES. The duties imposed upon the Vestry in these respects have each received attention. With regard to Slaughter-houses, and Cow-houses, each building has been inspected by the Medical Officer and Surveyor, and before the licenses were granted for the buildings being used, the several requirements necessary to fit them for the purposes intended were carried out to the Board's satisfaction. The several Bake-houses in the Parish in number have also been inspected, and notice of the several works directed to be observed by the Act, has been given to each occupier. WATER SUPPLY. Numerous complaints having been received of the insufficient quantity and impure quality of the water supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, to this district, a memorial signed by twenty Inhabitant householders, was sent to the Board of Trade under the Act upon the subject. The Board of Trade appointed Captain Tyler, the engineer, to into the complaint, and that gentleman after inspecting the district and the Company's works, reported to the Board of Trade that the complaint was well founded, and that in order to remedy the same, the Company were constructing two new filter beds, affording an area of about 150,000 feet, and that Captain Tyler observes in his report, that the house proprietors in the district are much to blame for not supplying better fittings, and proper means of storage for the use of their tenants, and that the Company having full power to compel the householders or proprietors to provide proper cisterns or other receptacles with sufficient ball cocks or other apparatus, and to prevent undue waste, are again to blame in not putting their powers in force. ANNUITIES. The last of the Annuities granted by the late Waterside Commission dropped during the year by the death of Mr. Shave. OPEN EARL SEWER. The Vestry observing that the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board had recommended that the arching over of this sewer should be deferred, they pointed out to the Metropolitan Board by memorial the serious injury which would arise to the Parish if the work was delayed, and are pleased to state that they have reason to believe the arching of such sewer will be proceeded with at no distant period. CONTRACTS. The contracts in force at the end of the year were as follows : — Horse Hire, —Mr. Reddin, —8s. a day for one year, from 29th September, 1863.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISH 0F BERMONDSEY FOR THE YEAR 1863, By WILLIAM PARKER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. To the Vestry of Bermondsey. Gentlemen, Before entering into the consideration of the vital statistics of our Parish, it is of great importance to obtain as correct an estimate as possible of the number of its inhabitants. The population of London within the weekly tables increased at the rate of 1,975 per cent, annually in the ten years ending 1851, and at the rate of 1,722 in the ten years ending 1861. In Bermondsey the rate of increase was 3,688 and 2,170, for the same periods respectively. In both instances the rate of increase decreased, and the increase during; the 5£ years, from the middle of the ten years 1853-62 to June 1863, was for London, at a rate between and of the population, but for Bermondsey about J. The Parish of Bermondsey is rapidly increasing by immigration, at a rate difficult to be decided, in the absence of an annual census. In the ten years preceding the census of 1861, the natural increase, or that arising from the excess of births over deaths was 7,903, and that by immigration 2,324. The natural increase in the years 1861-62-63, was respectively 1,134, 1,142, and 1,050. A proportionate influx would add about 340 more to the population yearly, or an addition of about 3,250 since the date of the census in 1861 to the middle of 1863. By this calculation the population of Bermondsey would appear to have been about 61,450 in the year 1863. The number of inhabited houses in Bermondsey in the years 1841 1851 and 1861, was respectively 5,667, 7,095 and 8,210. The population at these several periods was 34,947, 48,128 and 58,355, or 6.2, 6.7 and 7.11 residents in each house. It will thus be observable that there was a gradual increase in the density of the population. In the year 1863, the number of inhabited houses was approximately 8,620. Now if we take 7.11 as the average number of persons in each house, we shall show a population in Bermondsey of nearly 61 300 persons. The inference to be drawn from the above calculations is that instead of the rate of increase decreasing it has somewhat increased during the last two years, also that the density of our population is becoming greater, and that our annual increase on the total population of the Parish is at the rate of at least 2.5 per cent. It will therefore be correct in our weekly statistics to add instead of 1/10 for increase of population during the last decenniad. The population of Bermondsey in 1863, may safely be taken for our present purpose, at about 61,400, of which number death deprived us of 1,576, a number which was more than restored by 2,626 births, giving us a natural increase of 1,050. The proportion of births to the population was 42-77 in the thousand and the death rate 25'66. The death rate for all London was 24-52. This death rate is somewhat unsatisfactory, as that for 1862 was hut 23 in the thousand, and that for the previous ten years averaged 24-8 to which average the last two years have now returned. It is unsatisfactory also to reflect that the difference is mostly to be attributed to the presence of Zymotic, or preventable diseases. The deaths in Bermondsey from all causes are classified in table 1 (appendix) after the mode adopted by the Registrar General, also for twelve periods of life. First and most important is the class of ZYMOTIC DISEASES, most of which are infectious, and are all, more or less, under the control of sanatory measures. Table No. 2 (appendix), classifies seven of these diseases which are usually selected as tending to indicate the health of the people. With the exception of Diptheria they have severally increaaed out of all proportion to the increase of population, or to the number of deaths from all causes when compared with the three previous years. As they have also increased in the Metropolis, a similar table, Table No. 3 (appendix) was framed for the sake of comparison with all London. By reference to'this table we perceive that Small Pox has greatly increased in London, but in Bermondsey to a much less extent ', Measles to a greater degree in Bermondsey. Scarlatina has much increased in London, and even in a greater proportion in Bermondsey. Whooping Cough though stationary in the Metropolis has more than doubled its number of victims in Bermondsey. We have likewise suffered from an increase in Fever and Diarrhoea whilst Diptheria has decreased. Typhus, so very prevalent in other parts of London in 1862, invaded Bermondsey and South London generally in 1863. Ihe other Zymotic diseases which arise 'from various causes, _ some from privation, others from vice, need not here be alluded to, neither is it necessary to recapitulate the other causes of death which are to be found in the first mentioned table. 146 deaths from Consumption among the middle aged; 144 from Bronchitis, mostly among the very young and those advanced in years; and 94 from Pneumonia, will probably attract attention. Tables Nos. 4 and 5 (appendix) present a weekly statement of the mortality of each sub-district for the year 1862 and 1863. The former was found in the report book, and appears to have been prepared by the vestry's late medical officer, Dr. Challice. THE INQUESTS held in the Parish of Bermondsey in 1863, amounted to 41. The verdicts were as follows Apoplexy and other fits 10 ; Convulsions in infants 4 ; Disease of the Heart 3: Spasm of the Glottis 3; found in the Thames drowned by accident 2: accidental Scalds and Burns 4; Asphyxia in bed 4; Natural Decay 2; Wilful Murder by exposure of infants 2; Found Dead, Newly Born 3; buicide in a water butt 1; Debility 1; Thrush 1; Suddenly 1; Intemperance 1. The number of those interred without medical certificate was no less then 94 or nearly 6 per cent, of the entire deaths. They were registered as follows:- Convulsions 19, mostly infants; Bronchitis 4 ; Pneumonia 5; _ Consumption 9; Inflammation of Chest 2, Disease of Lungs 1, of Heart I; Menmgites 3 ; Whooping Cough 4 ; Scarlatina 5 ; Measles 3 ; Small Pox 2; Diarrhoea 6; Premature Birth 7: Atrophy and Marasmus 7; Old Age and Decay 4 ; Paralysis, Syphilis, Nephritis. Laryngismus Stridulus, Tracheitis, Synocha, Inflammation of the Bowels, Hcemoptisis, and Intemperance, of each 1. Twelve of the above died without any medical attendant whatever. If we apply these figures to the Metropolis we see an amount of trifling with human life fearful to contemplate. The books of the poor law medical officers have been open to me by tie favour of the Board of Guardians, and from them I have from time to time "leaned useful information. The total number of cases of illness under treatment during the year was in the St. James's district 2,237, in the St. Mary Magdalene 234, exclusive of the "Workhouse, and in the Leather Market 1,691. An invasion of fever commenced towards the end of the summer in the small streets and courts, near Hickman's Folly, Dockhead. Hence it was soon transported to Foxlow Street and Maltilda Place, at the lower end of the Parish, and from these two centres it spread to the surrounding streets. Its virulence was in a great measure checked before winter set in, by the promptness of the Board of Guardians and their Officers in separating the infected by removing them to the Fever Hospital. Most of the houses where it took place were thoroughly cleansed under the direction of your Medical Officer and Inspector of Nuisances. It is a fact to be recorded that this Fever was mostly Typhus, the form usually attributed to overcrowding, Typheia (Typhoid) and Typhinia, Relapsing Fever— the fevers of sewage and of famine were comparatively less prominent. Railway improvements have been the cause of much overcrowding in Bermondsey. A house to house visitation was directed by the Vestry, and was carried out mostly in the St. James's sub-district, until interrupted by the illness of the Vestry's late Inspector of Nuisances. During the year the Medical Officers of the Vestry reported twenty-six times on the health of the Parish, and on complaints made to them from time to time. In seventeen instances trade nuisances were referred to in these reports. Improvements in the paying of courts were recommended, and cleansing and ventilating of dwellings directed, and, when necessary, enforced. Other sanitary works were also promoted some of which for convenient reference are to be found in the appendix to this report. Thirty-nine slaughter-houses, and twentyseven cow-houses have been inspected and reported on previous to renewal of licenses. Without doubt the most important sanitary question brought before the Vestry was that of Mater supply, both as regards quality and quantity. The course adopted by the Vestry of bringing the subject under the notice of the Board of Trade has led to efforts on the part of the Southwark Water Company, which must ultimately lead to good results. It is however a subject for regret that the quantity when sufficient is not more equitably divided, and that the vexed question of constant supply has not been definitively settled. If our Parish is not to expect this soon it is really time the poorer classes of our Parishioners were supplied with better water receptacles. Before closing this report I would recommend that the Vestry should request the Board of Guardians to continue to issue periodical notices of vaccination in order that Small Pox may not increase as it has done in other parts of London. I now beg to offer my thanks to the Vestry for the courtesy I have always experienced from its members individually and collectively, and for the encouraging and favourable manner in which my suggestions have always been received. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, WM. PARKER, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. 15 TABLE I. Mortality of the Parish of Bermondsey for the 53 weeks ending January 2nd, 1864.
