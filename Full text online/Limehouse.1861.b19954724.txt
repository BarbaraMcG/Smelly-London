Gully drains, in various parts of the district, have been repaired and reconstructed; and several gullies have been raised and altered to suit the altered levels of the new pavements. In consequence of many complaints by the inhabitants of Fore Street, Limehouse, during the month of July, 1861, the sewage passing through the Nightingale Lane sewer was deodorized near the outlet, several times daily, with deodorizing fluid supplied by Messrs. Morre 11 and Co. HOUSE DRAINAGE. 104 applications have been received for drainage, and notices for the erection of 73 new buildings. 250 houses and other premises have been drained, and the following works executed in connection therewith, viz.:— 666 feet 9-in. pipe drains laid. 8,801 „ 6-in. „ „ 2,149 „ 4-in. „ „ Total 11,616 feet. 6 gullies constructed. 265 closet pans and traps fixed. 318 sinks and traps fixed. 884 feet old drains cleansed and repaired. 97 Cesspools cleansed and filled up.

New footway-paving has been laid in the following streets and places, viz.:— Limehouse.—Five Bells Alley, part of Nightingale Lane, Risbie's Rope Walk, Oak Lane, Limehouse Causeway, Green Dragon Alley, Spread Eagle Street, Mitre Street, Three Colt Street, John Street, Mary Street, Webb's Place, Three Colt Court, and Farrant's Terrace. Ratcliff.—Walter Street, Grosvenor Street, Caroline Street, part of Church Row, and Ashtield Place.

Two paved crossings for the convenience of foot passengers have been constructed, by the permission of the Commercial Road Trust across the Macadamized roadway of the East India Dock Road, Limehouse. 36 Sundry repairs have been (lone from time to time to the foot and carriage-ways pavings throughout the district, so as to maintain the same in an efficient state. The paving of the unpaved portion of the Parish of Limehouse is completed, with the exception of some of the Courts and Alleys. UNPAVED ROADS. These roads have been repaired from time to time, as occasion required, with gravel and broken stone. Mary Street and John Street, Rhodeswell Road, Limehouse, have been taken under the control of the Board, a contribution having been paid towards the expenses of paving, &c., by the owners ; the roadways have been formed and made up with gravel. CLEANSING. The principal roads and streets in the district have been swept twice a week by the men in the employ of the Board. The Contractors for scavenging and removing the dust have been fined several times for neglecting to carry out the terms of their contracts. An alteration has been made in the contracts entered into from Michaelmas, 18G1, to Michaelmas, 1862; the scavenging and watering being contained in one contract, instead of being let in separate contracts as previously. WATERING. 1 The whole of the streets and places in the district have been watered by the Contractor with water supplied by the East London WaterWorks Company, between the 18th March and 12th October, 1861. LIGHTING. The number of public lamps in the district is 649, being an increase of 12 on the number reported at Lady-day, 1861. The increase in the number of lamps is principally caused by the erection of new lamps in the New Victoria Park Approach Load. 37 Several alterations have been made in the situation of the lamps in various parts of the district. An arrangement has been made with William Cotton, Esq., to light certain streets on the Cotton Estate at Limehouse, and to charge him with the expense thereof, deducting certain amounts on account of the rateable houses therein, until the requisite number of houses are erected, and the streets taken under the control of the Board. PUBLIC URINALS. The number of compartments provided in these urinals 1s 28. The urinals are flushed with water several times daily by men employed by the Board; and during the summer months are deodorized after each flushing with deodorizing fluid supplied by Messrs. Morrell and Co. IMPROVEMENTS. Limehouse. Mr. William Cotton has completed the part of the new Victoria Park Approach Road, Limehouse, contained within his estate ; and the same having been certified by the Metropolitan Board of Works, has been taken under the control of the Board and lighted. Arrangements have been made for Mr. Cotton to pave the footway on one side of the road, and for the Board to pave the other footway. Negotiations are pending with the owners of certain properties in Limehouse Fields, for the purchase of the same, for the purpose of forming a new street from Salisbury Street to Catherine Street, which will greatly improve the locality, and be a convenience to the public. Shad well. Notice has been given by Mr. Edmund Phillips, the owner of property abutting 011 King James Stairs, to the Board (as Surveyor of Highways) to divert the thoroughfare leading from Wapping Wall to the said Stairs, to a short distance eastward thereof, and to stop up the old thoroughfare. 38 Wapping.

By arrangements with the London and Blaekwall Railway Company, the Company have fixed dripping pans under some of the bridges crossing streets in the district. New Offices. The freehold houses Nos. 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31, on the west side of White Horse Street, belonging to the Board, have been pulled down, the materials sold by auction, and the ground has been cleared for the site of the proposed new offices of the Board, arrangements having previously been made with the tenants to give up possession. The plans of the new offices prepared by the Surveyor of the Board, as the Architect, have been approved, and the building will be commenced forthwith.
