The Medical Officer of Health reports as follows:— During the year ending on the 27th December, 1862, 3287 deaths and 5528 births were registered. During the same period, the deaths in all London amounted to 66950 in a population of 2,859,778, being in the proportion of 1 death to 42 persons living, or at the rate of 2.349 per cent. In the Eastern Districts of the Metropolis, of which Shoreditch forms a part, and which it most nearly resembles in the character and density of population, the deaths were 15007 in a population of 571,158, or 1 in 38, being at the rate of 2.592 per cent. The deaths in Shoreditch amounted to 3,287 in a population determined by Census in 1861 to be 129,339. Estimated on this basis, that is, assuming that there has been no increase of population since the Census, the death-rate would be 1 in 39, or 2541 per cent., a rate exceeding that of the Metropolis at large, but comparing favourably with that of the Eastern District to which Shoreditch belongs. Since the Census was taken on the 8th April, 1861, a considerable number of houses have been demolished, to make room for improvements and railway structures. In this way some check must have been experienced to the former steady increase of population. But since the registered births during the year exceed the deaths by 2241, it may be assumed that Shoreditch has advanced in population in at least the same ratio as London generally; and if, as may fairly be done, the deaths of 225 persons which occurred in St. Luke's Workhouse be deducted, there will be presented a mortality of 3062 in a population estimated for April, 1862, at 129,529. This will give a death-rate of 1 in 42, thus bringing Shoreditch up to the standard of all London. This result must be regarded as satisfactory, for Shoreditch, undoubtedly, contains a larger proportion than other parts of the Metropolis of labouring people and struggling poor, compelled by their necessities to live and die in the close dwellings and impure air of the town. 12 This result is satisfactory not only in comparison with the general Metropolitan and Eastern death-rates of the year under survey, hut also in comparison with the death-rates of Shoreditch in past years. Thus the death-rates for the years 1855-1862 are as follows: 1 in 39, 1 in 40, 1 in 35, 1 in 38.6, 1 in 43, 1 in 43, 1 in 43, 1 in 42. During four successive years, then, Shoreditch has fairly kept pace in Sanitary progress with the rest of the metropolis. Descending from this gross statistical comparison to a closer investigation into details, we find that 48 per cent. or nearly half the deaths occurred in children under the age of 5 years. The proportion is heavy, hut is slightly less than in the preceding year, when it reached 49 percent. The causes that account for infantile mortality will be seen minutely set forth in columns 2 and 3 of Table I. Particular Causes of Death.—As in former years, Phthisis or lungconsumption occupies the highest place in the mortality table. 376 deaths are assigned to this disease. The second place is occupied by Bronchitis, which carried off 304 persons. To these may be added 234 deaths from Pneumonia, another form of lung-inflammation, 83 deaths from other lung diseases, and 59 from inflammation of the wind-pipe, making a total from lung-diseases of 1,056 deaths. To these might, perhaps, still be added 147 deaths of children under 10years of age from "Whooping-cough." Closely associated with the lungs, by situation, function, and interdependence of disease, is the heart. The deaths from diseases of this organ are 98. Adding those we find an aggregate of 1154 deaths traced to diseases of the chest—more than onethird of the whole. These diseases are not, indeed, recognised as being of the zymotic or epidemic class. But it cannot be doubted that in many instances, especially in the cases of Pneumonia and Laryngitis, and Consumption, the causes are of similar nature, and indicate the subjection to the same defective Sanitary conditions. The fact that in a vast proportion of instances the constitution is assailed by morbific agents carried in the air, deserves to be considered in connection with this marked preponderance of diseases of the lungs, the organs that encounter the first direct attack It must not, however, he forgotten that hereditary taint, intemperance and other causes play an important part in the causation of chest-diseases. Brain-diseases, including Convulsions and Apoplexy, caused 408 deaths. In connection with this subject, it is to 13 be remembered that in the district, namely in Hoxton, is situated a large lunatic asylum. In this institution there died 26 persons. 159 deaths are set down to Scrofula, Water-on-the brain, and Mesenteric disease. The diseases of this class are intimately associated in nature with Phthisis, and are largely traceable to the influence of hereditary causes and defective sanitary conditions. Stomach-diseases, including diseases of the Liver and Kidneys, and "Dropsy," are assigned as the causes of 155 deaths. 101 of these occurred under the age of 60 during adult life, and many are certainly the result of intemperance in drink. 4 deaths specified under the head of "Alcoholism," indicate the direct effect of alcoholic poison. 14G deaths from Atrophy and Debility express vaguely the operation of various causes, which cannot be analyzed or classified. 121 deaths are ascribed to "Old Age;" but since comparatively few persons sink without exhbiting more or less obvious disorder of a particular part of the body, many deaths of persons who might properly be said to have fallen under the weight of years, are assigned to specified diseases, especially Bronchitis and Debility. The deaths of 69 infants are ascribed to "Premature Birth," and "Malformations," that is, they were born not " viable," or unfitted by defective developement for life. Epidemic Diseases.—The influence of unhealthy local conditions is more especially traced in 689 deaths from so-called zymotic or epidemic diseases. Of these, 7 were cases of Small-Pox, 206 of Fever, 162 of Scarlatina, 90 of Diarrhœa, and 25 of Diphtheria. From the 206 Fever deaths registered in Shoreditch, the large deduction of 81 cases occurring in St. Luke's Workhouse must be made, so that the proper mortality from Fever in Shoreditch is 125 only. I must beg to refer to my report for the year 1861, for some observations concerning the distinction in nature and causation between "Typhus" and "Typhoid" Fevers, which are necessarily registered under a common designation. The Typhoid fever is the disease mainly represented in the mortality tables of former years. It is that form which is chiefly associated with defective sewerage. It is but feebly infectious. It is almost certain that the causes of this fever have declined in number in proportion to the extension of sewerageworks in the district. The excess of Fever deaths is due to the spread of Typhus fever, a disease especially associated with over-crowding, bad, and insufficient food, and the other results of destitution. This form 14 of Fever is liable to be propagated by contagion. We may draw a fair presumption of the spread of this disease from the history of Fever in the St. Luke's Workhouse. During the year 1861, only 12 deaths from Fever were recorded as occurring in this institution. But during 1862, we find no less than 81 cases. A large proportion of these were cases of Typhus imported from the Refuge for the Destitute. During the same year, 1862, 21 cases of Fever died in Shoreditch Workhouse. In the previous year, 1861, the number was 11. These figures, illustrated by direct medical observation of individual cases,—without which control, no vital statistics are to be trusted,—show that during the last year Typhus fever has prevailed in Shoreditch as in other parts of the town, although to a less extent. Deducting these cases, we should arrive at a residuum of Typhoid cases not at all exceeding, perhaps even falling short of, the mortality of former years, and offering no exception to the rule of progressive improvement in salubrity which has been observed during the administration of the Vestry appointed under the Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855. Next on the list of epidemics is Measles, which destroyed 199 children. Scarlatina destroyed 162 children; and Diphtheria, 25. Diarrhoea carried off 76 children and 14 persons of adult age. That this disease is in a great majority of cases the immediate effect of the entry of some poisonous matter generated by sewage fermentation or some other product of defective sanitary conditions I have no doubt. It is the summer-equivalent of the winter-pneumonia. Both diseases own a similar origin, but the system reacts in a different manner against the poison introduced. In the winter the lungs bear the brunt of the disease, which may be explained in part by the fact, that in cold weather children are cooped up in small close rooms, and exposed constantly to the foul emanations accumulating therein. In the summer, cess-pool and sewer fermentation is more active; whilst the bowels are more prone to irritation from their compensatory relation to the skin, which is subject to great alternations of action under the influence of heat. The total number of deaths from Diarrhœa is very small. As Diarrhoea is an important test of local sanitary conditions, I give the number of deaths from this cause for each year since 1855. They stand as follows: 112, 107, 146, 143, 194, 76, 149, 90. The number of deaths will of course 15 vary in different years according to the modifications of atmospheric conditions. But the great fact remains that Fever, Diarrhoea, Scarlatina, and Measles owe their origin to causes strictly personal and local; and are, therefore, to be combated and prevented by minute attention to personal and local hygiene. No one, now, advocates the Thames-theory of the causation of disease. The soundness of the views urged by me in reports of the Vestry in 1856 and 1857, a period when the Thamestheory was universally believed in, is now no longer contested. The completion of the Main Drainage will no doubt improve the condition of the River. The attainment of this object is very desirable in itself. The projected embankment, by removing the mud-banks and regulating the stream, will effect another important improvement. But that the health of the town will be in any appreciable degree ameliorated by this gigantic and costly work, I do not believe. For this amelioration we must, still look to the steady application of local sanitary measures. 69 deaths are ascribed to Violence. The greater number of these deaths were the subjects of coroner's inquests. Many refer to infants suffocated in bed, often, no doubt, accidentally, in consequence of the prevalent error that infants do not require the same free access of air to the lungs, whilst asleep, as grown-up persons. Acting on this prejudice, infants are commonly swaddled up in a shawl, and buried under the bedding in such a manner that they are compelled to breath the same air over and over again, until they are entirely poisoned and asphysiated. Sickness Returns.—In Table III. are set forth the returns of the new cases of sickness coming under the care of the Poor Law Surgeons during the year. It appears that there were 17 cases of Small-Pox; 219 of Measles; 113 of Scarlatina; 325 of Diarrhoea; and 921 of Fever. The total number of cases of all kinds was 6145. Small-Pox and Vaccination.—The small number of deaths from SmallPox during the year 1862 wculd scarcely appear to call for extended observations upon this subject. But the rapid spread of Small-Pox in an epidemic form throughout Shoreditch, in common with the Metropolis at large, forms, during the present year, a striking commentary upon the following passage extracted from my report for the year 1861.—"The cases of death from Small-Pox were 12. In 1859 the number was 87; 16 in 1860, 23. We are now in a period of decline of this disease. It appears to have its periods of rise and fall. During the intervals of remission, there is a gradual accumulation of subjects susceptible to the disease, who will take it the moment they are exposed to the contagion. Accordingly, when a certain amount of fuel for the contagion has been collected, the disease spreads until the fuel is exhausted. I do not regard the low number of deaths from Small-Pox during last year as affording particular cause for congratulation. There are no grounds for concluding that any great advance has been made of late years, in extending the protection of Vaccination." So far, then, as statistics inform us upon this question, the experience of last year confirms the result shown in my several successive annual reports, namely, that the proportion of vaccinations to births has been continuously decreasing. No fact can more clearly demonstrate the necessity for increasing the facilities for vaccinating. During the six months ending Midsummer, 1863, 56 persons paid with their lives the penalty for neglect of vaccination. During the year 1862, 3 patients afflicted with Small-Pox were sent to the Small-Pox Hospital, at Highgate. During the six months ending at Midsummer last, 8 patients were sent to the same institution. The following table exhibits the progress of vaccination since 1854 : Vaccinations. Births. Proportion.

The first is to place all the persons susceptible to the disease, as promptly as possible, under the protective influence of vaccination. The second is to diminish the immediate risk of 17 contagion, by removing the first patients attacked in a locality to a hospital or other fitting place for treatment. The first means, namely, affording the protection of vaccination hardly needs explanation. The number of persons who still prefer Small-Pox to vaccination is very small, and their prejudices are opposed to the safety of their neighbours, and to the laws enacted for the general security. The only question, then, in reference to this point is, whether the means provided for vaccinating are sufficient. I submit that the Table laid before you, showing the progressive fall in the proportion of registered vaccinations to births from 69 per cent. in 1856 to 40 per cent. in 1862, and 56 deaths from Small-Pox during six months, are proofs beyond dispute of the need for more extended facilities for vaccination. I felt it my duty, in a report dated the 30th January, 1863, to submit to the Vestry the desirability of suggesting to the Board of Guardians the expediency of appointing additional vaccinators, especially in the more densely-populated districts. That report was adopted, and the recommendation was accordingly forwarded to the Board of Guardians. It is fair to state that a theory has been advanced to the effect that good vaccination is secured by centralising the stations, and limiting the number of public vaccinators. This opinion is based on the fact that it requires a considerable nnmber of children to come yearly under the hands of one vaccinator, to enable him to keep up a good supply of vaccine lymph. This consideration is entitled to some weight if applied to sparse rural districts. But the cases is very different in a thickly-populated town district like Shoreditch. The great fact that under a too limited number of official vaccinators, a very large proportion of the children born remain unvaccinated, is a sufficient proof of its fallacy. If there were more vaccinators, it is reasonable to conclude that many children who do not find access to a public vaccinator would be protected. The use of the second remedy, the removal of patients as soon as attacked, will be manifest on considering the following facts. If, in a crowded house or court, containing, as is sure to be the case, many unprotected persons, one individual is seized with Small-Pox, there is established a focus of contagion whence the disease will speedily be propagated. Every fresh patient attacked is an additional centre of contagion. And this is not all. Every patient fouls and infects a 18 separate kit of clothes and bedding, which, for a long time, retain the power of propagating Small-Pox. Now if the first patient attacked be at once removed to a Small-Pox hospital, not only is a focus of infection taken away from a susceptihle population, but time is given to protect that population by vaccination. Wo have had most gratifying examples of the efficacy of promptly putting an exposed population under the safeguard of vaccination; and 1 have no doubt many lives might bo saved if under emergencies such as that stated, time were gained to vaccinate. Under this conviction, and knowing that the Small-Pox Hospital, at Highgate, the refuge reliod upon by the Parish of Shorediteh, was overwhelmed with the demands upon its resources, and was therefore closed against more admissions, I had no hesitation in recommending the Vestry to represent to the Board of Guardians the expediency of adopting the course advised by the Association of Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health. This course was to open in such situations as may be best suited for the purpose, temporary buildings or wards for the reception and treatment of Small-Pox patients. The Vestry did not adopt this recommendation. But I still beg to urge, that the opportunity afforded by the projection of a now workhouse, of amending a serious deficiency in our sanitary administration should not bo lost. Tho fact that Shoroditeh cannot rely upon the Highgate Hospital, ought to be accepted as conclusive evidence that tho Parish ought to provide an independent rofuge for its population. It would not bo difficult to erect a small detached building near the new workhouso, and to place it under the workhouse stall', to serve as a Small-Pox Hospital. Feeling that where a sanitary measure like vaccination is carried out by compulsory enactments, it is right and oxpodient that all classes should bo correctly informed as to tho individual and public advantages contemplated in such enactments, I advised tho issue of a hand-bill froprinted in tho appendix), setting forth tho social and legal disabilities of neglecting Vaccination, and other information relating to Small-Pox and Vaccination. This measure, I believe, has been useful in giving an impetus to vaccination. Alleged Nuisance from Noxious Vapours.—An alleged nuisanco arising from the escape of acid vapours from an aqua-fortis manufactory has 19 come under consideration. In this case there was no doubt that acid fumes were carried in considerable quantity into the adjoining streets and houses, so as to cause serious annoyance to passers-by and residents in the vicinity. It was shown to the proprietor, that contrivances in use in similar establishments were effectual not only in preventing the escape of these vapours, but also in turning them to profit. He, however, preferred to discontinue the manufacture in that part of the building from which the nuisance arose. Cow-Houses.—Last year, by virtue of a clause in the "Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1862," cow-houses have been placed under the control of the Vestry and the Magistrates in the same way as the slaughter-houses. In consequence of this enactment, it has been necessary to frame certain rules for the regulation of these places. The Sanitary Committee, attended by the Medical Officer and Inspector of Nuisances, inspected all the cow-houses. The Medical Officer drew up a report on this inspection, embodying some observations on the conditions that ought to govern the granting of licences. This report was read before the Magistrates in session, when the principles set forth met with their approval. There can be no doubt, from present experience, that this measure will work well, and prove of service both to cow-keepers and the public. The conditions required are detailed in the appendix. That there is no hardship in enforcing these conditions was proved by the inspection, when several cow-houses were found to fully comply with them. Thus the standard required is actually found to be adopted by the more judicious and intelligent of the cow-keepers themselves. Drinking Fountains and Pumps.—During the past year the question of erecting additional public drinking fountains, and of repairing pumps drawing their supply from surface-drainage, has been considered. The Vestry have determined to erect one new fountain, and a site has been selected for the purpose. With regard to the water drawn from the surface wells, I am unable to modify the conclusions often expressed in my reports, that it is unsafe and unfit for drinking. It is liable to many sources of contamination, which may prove detrimental to health. At present the drinking fountain erected by Mr. Long is the only one available in the Parish. 20 The sanitary works recommended are summed up in the Report of the Inspector of Nuisances. Gas.—The Gas supplied by the Independent Gas Company has been subjected to examination, as to its illuminating power and chemical purity. The examinations have generally been made at the place fitted up by the Company, without giving previous notice. Other observations have been made at the residence of the Chemical Examiner, in Finsbury Square. The mean of 45 observations to determine the illuminating power was 13.6 candles—the maximum required by the Act being twelve candles. The minimum illuminating power recorded is 12.6 candles; the maximum, 14.6. The Gas generally contained a perceptible quantity of Ammonia. No free Sulphuretted Hydrogen was ever detected. There is no convenience for the construction and working of an apparatus for the determination of the quantity of Sulphur which may exist in other forms of combination. On one occasion, many consumers complained of a marked odour of Sulphuretted Hydrogen. If this arose from the Gas, it was, no doubt, owing to some temporary or accidental passage of the gas into the gasometers without being properly purified. The pressure was very constantly from 2.0 to 2.3 inches after dark. TABLE I. Shewing the Causes of Death, at different ages, during the year 1862. Deaths of Persons of the Ages.

LEONARD, SHOREDITCH. PUBLIC NOTICE concerning SMALL POX & VACCINATION. SANITARY DEPARTMENT, 37, HOXTON SQUARE, May 1863. Penalty against Inoculation or exposure of persons affected with Small-Pox Vaccination Penalty for Neglecting Vaccination Re-Vaccination Disabilities attending NonVaccination I. The Vestry having had its attention directed to the great prevalence of Small. Pox in the Parish, has deemed it advisable to make known to the inhabitants, the provisions now in force relative to Small-Pox and Vaccination. As those provisions have been enacted for the common safety against a highly contagious & dangerous disease, it concerns every one to aid in carrying them out. II. By Clause VIII. of the 3rd and 4th Vict., cap. 29, Any person who shall wilfully by any means whatsoever produce the disease of Small-Pox shall be liable to be proceeded against summarily, and shall upon conviction be imprisoned in the Common Gaol or House of Correction, for any term not exceeding One Month. Persons going about in the public streets whilst still labouring under SmallPox are liable to punishment. III. By Clauses II, III, IV, of the 16th & 17th Vict., cap. 100, parents and Guardians of children, are required to have them Vaccinated within three months of birth; and to take the children on the eighth day following the day on which Vaccination has been performed, to the Surgeon, in order that he may be able to certify that the Vaccination has properly taken or otherwise. IV. By Clause IX. of the same Act, the Registrar is directed to give to the parents or guardians of children, within seven days after the registration of birth, a notice enjoining them to take the children to be Vaccinated ; and if this notice be neglected, the parents or guardians shall forfeit a sum not exceeding Twenty Shillings. V. The illness of a child is not held sufficient ground for neglecting or deferring Vaccination, unless it be certified by a medical practitioner that the child is in an unfit state to be Vaccinated, and the certificate to that effect is to be renewed every two months until the medical practitioner shall be of opinion that Vaccination may safely and properly be performed. VI. It being proved that in most cases where Small-Pox has occurred after Vaccination, the Cow-Pox had, from various causes, not taken fully, it is desirable to submit the marks of Vaccination to a medical practitioner, with a view to Re-Vaccination where the protection may be considered insufficient. VII. No person is allowed to Emigrate under the provisions of the Emigration Commissioners to a British Colony, unless it be certified by a medical practitioner that he has been duly Vaccinated, or has had the Small-Pox. In many Public Schools, and other establishments, a similar rule is observed. The neglect of Vaccination may also in other ways interfere with a person's employment or advancement in life. III. All persons are therefore hereby cautioned as to the penalties incurred by neglect of Vaccination; and are earnestly exhorted to immediately take all un-vaccinated children in their care, to the Surgeon appointed as Public Vaccinator of the District in which they reside, or to some other medical practitioner, for the purpose of being Vaccinated. IX. And in order further to aid the Vestry in the Prevention of Disease, it is requested that all persons having knowledge of the outbreak of Small-Pox in any locality, or of children being un-vaccinated, or of any other circumstance relating to these matters, will communicate the same to the Medical Officer of Health at the Offices of the Vestry.

By Order of the Vestry. w. G. DAVIS, VESTRY CLERK. Vebtry Offices, 37, Hoxton Square, 4th September, 1862. 26 The Inspector of Nuisances Reports as follows: I beg to lay before you the following summary of proceedings taken for the removal of nuisances, and the number of constructive works that have been executed for the sanitary improvement of the Parish, during the year ending March 25th, 1863. I inspected 2850 houses; 358 cess-pools have been emptied and filled up; 521 proper water closets have been erected in the place of open privies, all provided with proper trapped soil pans, and proper drains to the sewers; GO house-drains have been cleansed and repaired—a number of them that were old brick drains have been taken out, and glazed pipes put in their place, thus an efficient drainage has been provided for 581 houses; and in many of the yards the pavement has been repaired, and proper provision made for improved surface drainage. Dust-bins have been provided for 146 houses; additional windows have been made in 8 houses, to improve the ventilation; and 104 houses that had been the seat of contagious disease were either wholly or partially limewashed. These improvements have been distributed over the length and breadth of the Parish; but there arc two or three localities where the largest number have been effected. Boston-street, the east-side of which I reported as having been done last year, has now been completed, and all the houses, 80 in number, properly drained, the privies properly trapped, and the cesspools abolished. John-street, Dove-row, that was without the means of drainage until August last, where there were cesspools in every yard, and somo of them always overflowing, they being the only receptacles for the surface water. Since the sewer was made in the street, all the houses, 40 in number, have been properly drained, the cesspools all abolished, and the privies that were all open have been provided with proper trapped soil pans, and the places, such as they arc, made healthy and comfortable,—a pleasing contrast with their former condition. A sewer has recently been put into Cotton's-gardens, Hackney-road, and 24 privies have been drained into it, and the cesspools abolished. This place had long been a plague spot on the Parish map, the privies 27 stood close on the side of the public path, and were particularly offensive in warm weather. To complete the improvement here, a better mode of surface-drainage is necessary. The entire number of sanitary works executed since the establishment of the Vestry in 1856 are as follows :— 2740 cesspools have been abolished. 4070 water-closets have been erected in place of open privies. 2200 house-drains have been cleansed and repaired. 689 dust-bins have been provided. 110 houses have had an additional window put in to improve the ventilation. During the year I received 11 complaints of pigs being kept in places where they were a nuisance and injurious to health. Notices were given to the owners of the premises to have them removed, which was done. I made the usual periodical inspection of the licensed slaughter-houses, 94 in number, and found them in a satisfactory condition, proper attention being paid to cleanliness, drainage, ventilation, and water supply. Since the law requiring cow-houses to be licensed came into operation, in November last, I have made two periodical inspections of them, 48 in number, and on each occasion I found them satisfactory ; they were all in the first place visited by the sanitary committee, before the licenses were granted, and approved by them, on condition of certain improvements being made, which in every case was done with one exception, and to that the license was refused. During the year there were 690 applications to have dust removed, which were all properly attended to by the contractor. Several complaints were made during the winter, that the roads and streets were not properly cleansed. To these the special attention of the contractor was directed, and since that time there has been a marked improvement, and the work regularly and satisfactorily performed. I have only found it necessary in the course of the year to summon one person, the owner of a house in Brunswick-street, Hackney-road, before the magistrate at Worship-street, for refusing or neglecting to comply 28 with a notice previously given him, to abate a nuisance by abolishing a cesspool, and making a proper drain. Directly he received the summons, he commenced to do the work, but he did not appear at the court to justify or explain his conduct ; and as he had commenced the work, the magistrate would not, in his absence, make an order for costs. The past year has been distinguished by the commencement of a movement in the Parish, for providing superior dwellings, with proper regard to sanitary arrangements, for the working classes, at moderate rents. I refer to Langbourne-buildings in Mark-street, one block of which is finished and all occupied, containing 20 separate dwellings, two other blocks aro in course of erection that will also contain 20 separate dwellings each, and there is ground for two blocks more, being five altogether, which will, when completed, contain 100 separate dwellings; and so well has space been economised in the design, that these 100 dwellings will only cover the same ground that was previously occupied by 32 small houses of a very inferior character. The rents of those already inhabited range from five shillings to seven and sixpence weekly. Each house has a proper water-closet, with an abundant supply of water for domestic use, a place for keeping coals, plenty of cupboards, a copper for washing purposes, and the roof of the building being flat is properly guarded round, and serves for a drying ground. By a very convenient and ingenious contrivance, there is in every houso a spout for conveying the dust down to the dust-bins, which aro concealed under the areas behind; and another important advantage is they arc fire-proof. In those that are in progress, there will be a number of tho dwellings lot at four shillings per week each, having two rooms, with all the conveniences of the others, and that will be the minimum both of rent and accommodation. There aro several points of great public importance connected with these buildings. They arc the first that have been erected in the metropolis as a purely commercial speculation; and from the nature of tho material used, and the extraordinary economy of space, the cost of erection is so moderate as to leave no doubt of their being a profitable investment; all of what aro called "model lodgings," previously erected, have either been tho work of individual philantrophy, or associated charity, where a high remunerative return for the capital invested was not expected. This has operated against their success, for so long as these buildings do not pay something like tho same per centage as other 29 house property, they will never be erected to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of the metropolis; but when it is shown that such buildings can be erected so as to yield a very large return on the outlay, there will be no lack of capital to build as many as the law of supply and demand may require. Then there is another problem solved by these buildings. Fears have been expressed in some quarters, that in consequence of metropolitan improvements and railways causing the demolition of so many dwellings of the working classes, that there would be an actual dearth of houses suitable for them; but when it is shown that 100 dwellings of a superior character can be built on the same spac3 of ground that was previously occupied by 32 of a very inferior kind, there can be no longer any reasonable cause for anxiety in this respect, This locality is one of the best in the metropolis for the erection of dwellings for the working classes. The situation is elevated and healthy, and the short distance from the city makes it suitable for those employed there, and desirable as a place of residence on account of its convenience. There is a large space of ground on the same estate as Mark-street, at present occupied by a great number of small houses, many of them in a very dilapidated state, and so defective in sanitary arrangements as scarcely to be fit for habitation. The term of the existing leases is near expiration, and a favorable opportunity is presented for the profitable investment of capital in the erection of sanitary dwellings for the industrious classes: this ground is bounded by Paul-street on the west, the Curtain-road on the east, Bath-street and John-street on the north, and Chapel-street and New North-street on the south. Should any considerable portion of this ground be occupied by buildings similar to those in Mark-street, it would be of great advantage to the Parish in various respects. In a sanitary point of view, it would do good by removing a number of small dwellings that have been erected without the slightest regard to what is necessary or conducive to health, the only object being to crowd as many houses as possible into the smallest space of ground, the construction of them being such that they cannot be properly ventilated, they have yards so small, that when a brick wall surrounds them, both light and air are excluded, the surfaces are 30 generally badly paved, and worse drained where pools of liquid and other fœtid matter collect, that emit exhalations, both offensive and injurious, these become a source of disease, and disease among such a population almost necessarily leads to pauperism. To get such places removed, and well-ventilated healthy dwellings erected in their place, and occupied by a better class of people, would bo a great sanitary reformation; and not only so, but would also be an important advantage in a financial point of view, there would be less demand upon the poor-rate for pauper maintenance, and the amount of rates received from the property would bo greatly increased. The houses in Mark-street, when finished, will be five times the rateable value of the houses that formerly occupied the same ground; and there will also bo an important social advantage, the population will be increased fourfold, and the necessary consequence will bo a corresponding increase to the local trade. A mode of building possessing so many advantages, where all the circumstances are so highly favorable, cannot fail to be a commercial success ; and in future the wonder will be, that in the metropolis, where ground is so valuable, a system of building dwellings so well adapted for the working classes, had not been introduced long before, when all the convenience of a self-contained house can be provided at a moderate rent, and having the best provisions for health and comfort that sanitary scicnce requires. The following Bills have been before Parliament this Session, and have been considered by the Parliamentary Committee. Parochial Assessments Bill. This Bill will not interfere with Shoreditch parish. Great Eastern Railway Bill. The Vestry opposed this Bill for the purpose of introducing clauses for the protection of the Parish, but the Bill was thrown out by the House of Lords. 31 Metropolis Roads Bill. Transfer of charges of parts of the roads from the Commissioners of the Metropolis Roads to the Parishes in which those parts are situate, and abolition of tolls thereon. A memorial was presented to the Metropolitan Board, requesting them to represent to Parliament, the great additional burthens that would be thrown on the Parish should the Bill pass, and suggesting the Hackney Carriage Tax should be placed under their controul, as a fund to repair the roads, with power to borrow money, pave the roads, &c. This Bill is still under the consideration of Parliament. Saint Lukes Workhouse and Vestry Hall Bill. This Bill sought permission to transfer the land within the boundary wall of St. Luke's Workhouse, from the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, in which it is now situate, to the Parish of St. Luke, and to build a Vestry Hall and buildings thereon. The Vestry petitioned against this Bill, and opposed it before a Committee of the House of Commons, and the clause which proposed that the lands and premises occupied by the Guardians of St. Luke, and now forming part of the Parish of Shoreditch, should be transferred to and form part of the parish of St. Luke, was agreed by both parishes should be expunged, and a clause introduced to authorize the Parish of Saint Luke, to erect a Yestry Hall, Offices, &c., within the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. This Bill was also opposed by the Metropolitan Board with regard to the line of frontage in the City Road, and after some alteration passed. London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Bill. The Vestry petitioned the House of Commons to place the Coal and Wine Duties under the controul of the Metropolitan Board of Works, to carry out certain improvements in the Metropolis. Metropolitan and City of London Police Amalgamation Bill. The Vestry petitioned Parliament against this Bill; but the Bill was subsequently withdrawn in conscquence of some irregularity in the ceedings of the promoters. 32 The following Bills have been considered by the Committee. A Bill to Abolish Church Rates. A Bill for the Redemption of Church Rates. Alphabetical Register of Voters. Bakehouses Regulation Bill. Public Gardens Protection. Telegraphs Bill. A Bill to regulate the Removal of Infected Persons in Hired or Public Carriages. Vestry Hall. As to the site of land in King Street and Old Street Road.
