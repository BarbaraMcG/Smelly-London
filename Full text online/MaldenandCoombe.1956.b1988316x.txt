Borough of Malden and Coombe ANNUAL REPORT of THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH 1956 Public Health Department, Municipal Offices, New Malden. June, 1957. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Malden and Coombe. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1956 which has been prepared in accordance with Ministry of Health Circular 19/56. The health of the community remains good and the vital statistics compare favourably with those of the country as a whole. Both the death rate and notification rate of tuberculosis have continued to diminish during the past few years and are the lowest on record. It is interesting to note that deaths from cancer of the lung have been steadily increasing and that the rate for this Borough is higher than that for England and Wales. In 1947 the Medical Research Council planned a statistical study of smoking habits in connection with cancer of the lung, and the resultant figures which appeared 3 years later showed a pronounced statistical association between smoking (heavy cigarette smoking over long periods) and lung cancer. Evidence has since accumulated which confirms this statistical association. In my opinion it is essential that parents, teachers and all who have the interest of our youth at heart should make every effort to discourage young people from developing the habit of smoking. In conclusion I should like to thank the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee for their helpful co-operation and the staff of the department for the efficiency with which they have carried out their duties. I am, Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Your obedient servant, J. B. MORWOOD, Medical Officer of Health. 2 STATISTICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS.

Of the total number 13 or 2.4 per cent were illegitimate. 3 DEATHS. During the year 468 deaths were registered, an increase of 1 compared with those recorded in 1955, the rate per thousand being 10.7 compared with an average of 11.7 for England and Wales. The infantile mortality rate was 17.0, a low rate compared with the figure of 23.8 for England and Wales. 19 males and 3 females died from lung cancer, 3 more than in the previous year. The death rates from this condition per 1,000 population were .900 for males and .122 for females which is higher than the rates of .726 and .111 respectively for England and Wales. CAUSES OF DEATH.

SCARLET FEVER. The number of cases of scarlet fever notified during the year was twenty-seven giving an incidence rate of 0.59 per thousand population. All the cases were very mild and no fatalities occurred. Twenty-four cases were treated at home and three removed to Hospital. DIPHTHERIA. For the ninth year in succession the district was completely free from this disease, the last case having been notified in April, 1947. Immunisation against diphtheria progresses smoothly. Special efforts continue to be made to encourage mothers to bring their babies for immunisation in those cases where persuasion by the health visitor has failed. Under the National Health Service Act all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services in the scheme. This has resulted in a number of children being immunised otherwise than at schools or clinics. The following statistics refer to immunisation carried out during the year- Number of children immunised during the year (pre-school 524 school 37) 561 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 773 Although diphtheria is no longer a serious public health problem it must be remembered that the disease is still present and that any relaxation of the immunisation campaign could have serious results. Immunisation not only prevents many children from contracting diphtheria, but greatly mitigates the severity of the illness if a child should fall a victim to this disease. 8 WHOOPING COUGH. The number of cases of whooping cough notified was 90. One case was removed to hospital and no deaths occurred. Whooping cough is one of the most serious diseases of childhood and mothers appreciate the facilities for immunisation which are available. Fortunately the whooping cough immunisation campaign has had a beneficial effect on the diphtheria immunisation campaign because the prophylactic material most commonly used gives combined protection against both whooping cough and diphtheria. It is to be hoped that whooping cough immunisation will prove as effective as immunisation against diphtheria. As whooping cough is most dangerous in the first year of life immunisation should be commenced at the third or fourth month. Details of the number of children immunised against whooping cough during the year are as follows:— Number of children immunised 520 Number of children receiving reinforcing doses 137 VACCINATIONS. The substantial degree of protection from smallpox which the population had during the time of compulsory vaccination is being slowly reduced due to the reduction throughout the country in the numbers of children vaccinated at the appropriate times. The view of the Chief Medical Officer to the Ministry of Health is that for adequate protection at least 75% of infants should be vaccinated. The percentage of infants under 1 year vaccinated in this Borough during the year was 66.5% and efforts are being made to increase this figure. As with diphtheria immunisation, all medical practitioners providing general medical services in the area are given an opportunity to provide services for carrying out vaccinations. During the year the following were performed:- Vaccinations 418 Revaccinations 44 462 9 Of the above, 234 individuals were vaccinated or revaccinated by private practitioners. 373 of the persons vaccinated were under one year of age. ACUTE POLIOMYELITIS. 2 cases of acute poliomyelitis occurred during the year, 1 paralytic and 1 non-paralytic. Both made a complete recovery. An important step in the prevention of poliomyelitis was taken during the year. Immunisation was commenced in May and 150 children between the ages of 2 and 9 were immunised. There were no reactions and it is hoped that enough vaccine will be available to immunise a great many more children next year. DYSENTERY. 49 cases of the mild sonne dysentery occurred, chiefly affecting younger school children. This condition is highly infectious among young children and its incidence has been increasing during the past few years throughout the country. TYPHOID FEVER. One case of typhoid fever occurred which is of interest because the patient affected was a laboratory worker and contracted the infection whilst carrying out a bacteriological investigation of an infected specimen. MEASLES. The number of cases of measles notified (93) was much lower than in 1955. No deaths occurred. SCABIES AND VERMINOUS CONDITIONS. Necessary action for these conditions has been very limited and calls for no special comment. FOOD POISONING. There were 3 single cases of food poisoning which were due to salmonella typhi-murium 2, and salmonella anatum 1. 10 *CASES REMOVED TO ISOLATION HOSPITALS.

June, 1957. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Borough of Maiden and Coombe, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my annual report on the work carried out by your public health inspectors during the year. During the year the title of Sanitary Inspector was changed to Public Health Inspector and a new examination board established. As much time as possible has been devoted to detailed inspections of food premises in the Borough to ensure compliance with the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955, part of which came into operation on the 1st January, 1956, and the remainder on the 1st July, 1956. These regulations are more stringent than previous legislation and brought under control premises formerly exempt from inspection such as private clubs, institutions and residential establishments. It is pleasing to report that most managements have co-operated willingly in complying with the requirements of the regulations and it is to be hoped that the improvements made and additional facilities provided will do much to reduce the risk of food poisoning. In past years much has been done to provide the public with clean and safe water, milk and food. Efforts are now being directed towards bringing the air up to a much higher standard of purity. 15 Certain sections of the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation on the 31st December, 1956, and it is anticipated that the implementation of the provisions of this Act during the next 15 years will produce a considerable improvement by reduction of smoke from domestic and factory chimneys. HOUSING. The general standard of housing in the Borough is good. Number of houses built during the year— (a) by the Council 20 (b) by private enterprise 61 Number of houses in course of construction— (a) by the Council 2 (b) by private enterprise 43 For the purpose of abating nuisances or executing repairs to houses the following notices were served:— Preliminary 69 Abatement 9 These figures do not include verbal notices often given in regard to minor matters. HOUSING ACT, 1936, SECTION 11. Two demolition orders were made and the houses demolished during the year. SCHOOLS. A survey was made of the sanitary arrangements at the 22 school premises in the Borough and following representations improvements were carried out by the County Council. WATER SUPPLY. The whole of the area is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and the supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. In view of the large number of routine bacteriological and chemical examinations carried out by the Water Examination Department of the Board it was not considered necessary to make any routine tests. One water sample was taken on receipt of a complaint, the report on which was satisfactory. All dwelling houses in the area are supplied by public water mains direct to the houses. 16 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The following numbers of rooms were disinfected for the undermentioned causes:— Scarlet fever 1 Tuberculosis 3 Poliomyelitis or suspected poliomyelitis 8 Insect pests 17 Other 3 Five bags of clothing were disinfected. Routine disinfection after scarlet fever is not carried out and is only done in those instances where a special request is made. A bottle of disinfectant is supplied and advice given.

Jelly Crystals. — An informal sample of Jelly Crystals was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that they failed to comply with the setting test prescribed by the Food Standards (Table Jellies) Order, 1949. A subsequent formal sample proved satisfactory. Rollmop Herrings with Vegetables. — An informal sample of rollmop herrings with vegetables was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that the article had undergone some bacterial decomposition and was unfit for sale and also one of the ingredients (bay leaves) could not be regarded as coming under the generic term of "spices" and should be listed as a separate ingredient on the label in accordance with the requirements of the Labelling of Food Order, 1956. Another sample of rollmop herrings was in good condition, but there was a labelling offence in that neither onions nor bay leaves were included in the list of ingredients. A warning letter was sent to the retailer. The manufacturers had new labels printed to comply with the Labelling of Food Order. Rum Butter. — An informal sample was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that one of the ingredients was not specified on the label as required by the Labelling of Food Order. The matter was referred to the manufacturers who had revised labels printed. Tomato Paste. — An informal sample of tomato paste was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that salt was not specified as an ingredient on the label as required by the Labelling of Food Order. The matter was referred to the importers who contacted the manufacturers in Italy and corrected labels were printed and attached to the tubes of tomato paste. Tomato Puree. — An informal sample of tomato puree was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that salt was not specified as an ingredient on the label as required by the Labelling of Food order. The matter was referred to the importers who explained that goods intended for the Italian market were shipped to England in error, this shipment was now exhausted and any future supplies would be correctly labelled. MILK. During the year the following licences were issued under the Milk (Special Designations) (Raw Milk) or the Special Designations (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Dealers Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Pasteuriser's 1 Sterilised 14 Supplementary. Tuberculin tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 10 19 The difference between a dealer's and a supplementary licence is that, if a dairyman has premises in a local government area where he retails milk he is issued with a dealer's licence. Should he retail milk in another area he must obtain a supplementary licence from the Council of that area. DETAILS OF MILK TESTING. CLASS OF MILK Number of Samples Tested Appropriate Tests Number of Samples Passed Failed Pasteurised 89 Phosphatase 88 1 Methylene Blue 89 — Sterilised 3 Turbidity 3 — Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) 44 Phosphatase 44 — Methylene Blue 44 — Tuberculin Tested (Farm Bottled) 1 Methylene Blue 1 — Biological 1 — The purpose of the phosphatase and methylene blue tests is to determine respectively whether or not the milk has been adequately heat treated and whether it is of good keeping quality. The turbidity test for sterilised milk is to determine whether or not the milk has been adequately sterilised. The greater importance must be attached to the phosphatase test as correct heat treatment or pasteurisation reasonably ensures that all pathogenic organisms have been eliminated. This test is highly sensitive and a failure will result if the milk has been heated to only 1½°F lower than the correct temperature of 145°F (holder process), or held for twenty minutes at 145°F instead of thirty minutes. The addition of as little as a quart of raw milk in 100 gallons of pasteurised milk will produce an adverse result. Failures may result from any one of these three factors and inspection of the plant is necessary to ascertain the cause. Farm bottled (tuberculin tested) milk is not pasteurised and is retailed without treatment. It is pleasing to record that only one milk sample taken during the year failed to pass an appropriate test. 20 FOOD. There are no slaughter houses or knackers' yards in the Borough. The following table lists the food premises in the district by type of business. FOOD PREMISES No. in District No. of Inspections Made Public houses and hotels 12 20 Office and Works canteens 11 21 School canteens 9 16 Restaurants and cafes 15 45 Grocers (including off licences) 55 50 Greengrocers 23 27 Confectioners 28 29 Bakehouses 5 10 Bakers shops 15 16 Butchers 20 34 Dairy 1 11 Milk depots 4 4 Milk shops 7 15 Fish shops (wet or fried) 11 12 Cooked Meat shops 1 4 Institutions 17 6 Greengrocers stalls 1 1 Sports Clubs 13 9 248 330 The following premises are registered under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 for the purposes listed.

The following unfit foodstuffs were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed or salvaged:— Mutton 4½ lbs. Beef 190 lbs. Ox tongue 6 lbs. Corned beef 34 lbs. Luncheon meat 35 lbs. Jellied veal 6 lbs. Boneless Ham 34 lbs. Fish, wet 742 lbs. Vegetables 4 tins Fruit, tinned 954 lbs. Turkeys 227 lbs. Icing sugar 1,956 tubes FOOD COMPLAINTS. Certain of the food complaints received during the year are of interest: (1) Dirty Milk Bottles. Complaints were received with regard to foreign matter in milk bottles. Investigations showed that in no case was the milk affected and the foreign material was in all instances firmly adherent to the inside of the bottle. The materials were cement (2), paint (1), and mould growth (1). In each case after careful consideration the Council decided not to prosecute but a serious view would be taken of a repetition. A complaint regarding an insect in a bottle of milk was investigated. The alleged insect was found to be a toy rubber spider. The complainant's child admitted that he had inserted the toy spider as a practical joke. It is to be hoped that the embarrassed parents dealt adequately with the child. It would be of benefit to all concerned if the public would not misuse milk bottles but rinse them out and return them promptly to the roundsman. (2) Colour change in Chicory. Chicory was observed to assume a brilliant green colour after cooking. The complaint was investigated at the house and afterwards referred to the Public Analyst who conducted experiments which proved the ability of chicory to change colour in given circumstances. This condition is quite harmless. (3) Icing Sugar. As the result of information received from a neighbouring authority, 1,956 tubes of icing sugar which were rancid due to prolonged storage, were surrendered by an agent in this district. Several local authorities in the London area were advised that supplies had been delivered in their districts and these were withdrawn from sale. (4) Pineapple and apple pie containing piece of zinc. The complainant ate this pie whilst working on a building site. There was no proof that the metal had been cooked in the pie and the Council decided to take no action. (5) Mould growth in Steak and Kidney Pie. The Council decided to institute proceedings in this case and the retailer was fined £5. 5s. Od. with £3. 3s. Od. costs. 22 (6) Complaint of Welfare Foods Service Concentrated Orange Juice tasting of paraffin. Bottles of orange juice were submitted to the Public Analyst and the bacteriologist who reported that the orange juice was normal in composition and contained no foreign ingredients or impurities. (7) Tins of Salmon containing glass. Two complaints were received that glass had been found in tinned salmon. Investigation showed it to be a crytalised form of certain natural fluids which assume this glass like appearance during processing. The substance is harmless and no further action was taken. (8) Foreign matter in bread. The foreign matter consisted of a mixture of flour and vegetable oil which had discoloured the bread. The Council decided not to prosecute but a serious view would be taken of a repetition. ICE CREAM. Fifty-two samples were submitted to the methlylene blue test and, of these forty-eight were placed in grades I and II. Four were placed in grade III and none in the low category of grade IV. The results can be said to be satisfactory. The methylene blue test does not provide a guarantee of safety but it does serve as a simple and practical method of grading ice-cream according to its degree of bacterial cleanliness and samples which consistently fail to reach grades I or II give reasonable grounds to indicate defects in manufacture or handling requiring further investigation. The certificate giving the results of testing has the following note appended :— "Owing to the numerous factors governing the hygienic quality of ice-cream it is unwise to pay too much attention to the bacteriological results of any single sample. Judgement should be based rather on a series of samples. It is suggested over a six monthly period 50 per cent of vendors samples should fall into grade 1, 80 per cent into grades I or II, not more than 20 per cent into grade III and none into grade IV ". The following table shows the results of samples taken since 1947.

The Health Department of the Council concerned was notified and subsequent samples proved satisfactory. MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT. As the Council appoints an analyst for the purposes of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, they may execute any of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act other than those relating to importation, so far as relates to any foodstuff to which an Order in Council under the Act applies. These are administered by my department. Orders made under the Act require that on sale an indication of origin be given in the case of certain imported foods. A few cases were found where foreign apples or tomatoes were not labelled as such and verbal warnings were given. HEATING APPLIANCES (FIREGUARDS) ACT, 1952. This Act is to ensure that adequate guards are provided for heating appliances and standards are prescribed. Visits have been made to shops selling heating appliances during the year but in all cases the appliances inspected were satisfactory. RAG FLOCK & OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. One renewal of a licence to store rag flock was issued for a wholesale store. Two premises are registered for the purposes of the Act. These are premises where upholstery work is carried on. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. This Act provides for a system of licensing and inspection of pet shops by local authorities. Two applications for renewal of licences were received and after inspection and report were granted. SHOPS ACT, 1950. There are 352 shops in the Borough and inspections are made in connection with provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, which are concerned with sanitary accommodation, washing facilities, heating, lighting and ventilation. Where plans are submitted of new 24 construction or alteration to shop premises, due consideration is given to ensure that the proposals comply with the provisions of the Act. The Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the administration of the law relating to shop hours, including early closing and Sunday trading. 215 inspections were made during the year. Most of the necessary action taken was in connection with the exhibiting of notices and the sale from mixed shops of groceries etc., on the early closing day and Sunday mornings. SMOKE ABATEMENT. 51 visits were made in connection with smoke abatement and much time was spent in co-operation with the managements of two industrial premises to eliminate nuisance caused by intermittent emissions of smoke. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. The potential danger of the spread of disease and the damage done to foodstuffs make this service an important public health responsibility. The duties of the Council under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, were fully carried out. Householders appreciate the free service which has been maintained. A charge is made for the treatment of business premises, many of which are liable to infestation by nature of the trade carried on. The proprietors in many cases have made an annual service agreement which is a very satisfactory procedure. The resultant prompt notification of the presence of rats or mice and immediate treatment ensures that serious infestations do not occur. The Borough river boundaries, depots, sewage disposal works, disused refuse tips, piggeries and open spaces have received constant attention. The annual 10% test baiting of sewers was, after consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, again waived with a consequent saving of expenditure. HOUSING ACT, 1949 — IMPROVEMENT GRANTS. Many enquiries were made and advice given about grants available under the above Act. During the year 5 applications for an improvement grant were approved, 5 were given a preliminary approval, 4 were withdrawn and 1 was ineligible for grant. 25 The Council gave a preliminary approval to the scheme submitted by the Maiden and Coombe Housing Society for the conversion of a large house into 10 flatlets. This application follows a similar successful conversion by the Society and mentioned in my report for 1955. HOUSING REPAIRS AND RENTS ACT, 1954. No applications were received for certificates of disrepair during the year and no certificates issued in previous years were revoked. INSECT PESTS. During the year many members of the public sought advice regarding the destruction of insect pests. The carpet beetle continues to be prevalent in many parts of the district and thorough cleaning is the best method of control as the insect is resistant to the popular insecticides. The adult beetle is often mistaken for a grey-brown ladybird and in the larval stage of development is recognised as the "woolly bear" a larva with a soft body, thickly covered with hair and thick bristles at the tail end. Much damage is caused to woollen materials by the larva. Considerable nuisance was experienced in some parts of the borough by migrating hordes of clover mite. Although harmless these minute pests can be eradicated by treating the areas affected with derris and pyrethrum sprays. The bug. flea and louse, normally associated with public health preventative measures, continue to become less of a problem and during the year only ten rooms were treated for infestations of bugs. Thirty-five vacant council houses were inspected for evidence of insect infestation and two houses were treated for bug infestation. Requests were received from a number of householders for assistance in the destruction of wasps nests. Some nests were destroyed and other requests were declined where the nests were found to be in positions not causing real inconvenience. By arrangement with the Surrey County Council the school kitchens and canteens (six in number) were thoroughly sprayed at the appropriate time with D.D.T. solution as a deterrent against insect infestation. 26 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it was necessary during the year to arrange for one burial. CARAVANS. Licences were granted to station, five moveable dwellings in the area. PUBLIC SEWERS. Stoppages in public sewers (combined drains) were cleared by the department on two hundred and forty-five occasions. In a few instances the assistance of sewermen from the Borough Engineer's department had to be obtained. RAINFALL, 1956.
