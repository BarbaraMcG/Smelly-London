TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY. Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, This final year of the Borough of Stepney necessitated many plans being made for the integration of the three East End boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Stepney to form the new Greater London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The personal health services of the London County Council have to be integrated with the environmental health services of the metropolitan boroughs. A great deal of work in the latter half of the year was done to plan establishment structures, and to ensure that the efficiency of the public health services should not be adversely affected at a time of change; nor that individual staff should suffer by reason of a forced merger of different authorities. For all the transferring staff in the Public Health Department it has been possible to allocate them reasonably comparable posts, and no loss of salary. The way ahead for the year of integration will best be summed up by the motto 'Festina lente' (hasten slowly). A great opportunity does exist now that local services are to be administered, and controlled, by the local new borough. In an area such as the Greater London conurbation this can never preclude the necessity for the maintenance of close ties with neighbouring authorities, and with the new Greater London Council as required. In my last report I made valedictory remarks which covered the great work achieved by Stepney's Public Health Department in the past. With our thoughts on the future, we must make the same tradition of service live on as part of the larger Tower Hamlets with which many of us are privileged to serve at its inception. To all, both inside and outside the Department, who have made this last year (to include the first three months of 1965) a progressive one despite calls on time to plan another authority, and to those who over the years have made their positive contribution to the department I would express iny sincere gratitude. The Chairman and Members of Committees, the Town Clerk and other Chief Officers of the Council have, as always, given their willing help and support for which I thank them. The motto of Stepney is 'A Magnis ad Majora', may this be true of our future merger into Tower Hamlets. * * # As I wish to have this Report produced before the end of March in order to begin afresh with Tower Hamlets on 1st April, it is not possible 2 to include in the report certain vital statistics which are compiled from information supplied by the Registrar-General. However as soon as the necessary information is received, an addendum will be circulated. I am, Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, R. W. WATTON, Medical Officer of Health March, 1965. 3 STAFF OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT at 31st December. 196L MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH R. W. WATTON, M.B.,B.S.,D.P.H.,D.C.H.,D.I.H.

STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA General Information The Metropolitan Borough of Stepney is bounded on the west side by the City of London, on the east by the Borough of Poplar, on the north by the Boroughs of Shoreditch and Bethnal Green and on the south by the River Thames, the river boundary being some 2.39 miles in length. The borough is roughly rectangular in shape, the length being 2.3 miles, the breadth varying from 1-1½ miles, and contains approximately 83 miles of streets. The area of the borough is 1,902 acres and of this the river accounts for 136 acres and inland waters, consisting of docks and canals, cover 75 acres. Dark blue London Clay is found under the whole borough at a depth of between 20 - 30 feet from the surface. Above this level are layers and patches of gravel and sand, brown and yellow clays being found nearer the surface. In some parts of the borough there are layers of 'made' ground, the result of earlier habitation, and as is to be expected the flow of subsoil water is towards the river. The area is to a large extent industrial in character, factory premises being spread throughout the borough but tending to concentrate in the western end, with docks and wharves stretching along the whole of the river front, which forms the southern boundary. The chief industry of the borough is the manufacture of clothing of all kinds and it is estimated that one-third of the tailoring industry of Iondon is carried on in Stepney. Other major industries include brewing, engineering and the manufacture of furniture. Stepney is also one of the most important wholesaling districts in London. Spitalfields wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market and the London Fruit Exchange are situated in the borough. Notable landmarks in the borough include the Tower of London and the Royal Mint. Fifty Years Age The annual report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1914 contains the following informations The estimated population was 273,265 and the birth-rate was reported to be 29.2. The death rate (uncorrected) was 16,6 per thousand population and the infant mortality rate 125 per thousand births. Among the causes of death reported were; Tuberculosis 606, diarrhoea and enteritis 297, cancer 242, 6 measles 174, premature births 143, whooping cough 71, diphtheria 71, scarlet fever 25, alcoholism 36 and appendicitis 19. Deaths included that of the spy Lody, who was shot in the Tower of London, and seven Belgian soldiers who died in the London Hospital. The son of a shopkeeper was sentenced to two months imprisonment for aiding and abetting his father in having deposited on the premises a quantity of diseased meat weighing 55-stone. Twelve summonses were issued in respect of the conveyance of offensive matter through the streets during prohibited hours or in improper receptacles. Writing of the outbreak of the war, the Medical Officer of Health reported that there had been a great demand for workshops for the manufacture of military equipment of all kinds including "brushes for sweeping the trenches." On infant welfare the Medical Officer of Health stated that, "The use of dried milk is growing more widespread, and results from it seem quite satisfactory, if it be not continuously used for too long a period. Its use during the summer months is advantageous. It can be kept free from dust and flies, in a closed tin, and the risk of contamination is reduced. The difficulty of keeping cow's milk fresh and pure, during the hot season, in homes where there is no provision for suitable storage, is so great as to make its use for babies very unsafe, unless the mother is an intelligent careful woman. "The greatest evils as regards feeding, that the Health Visitor has to contend with are, firstly, irregularity of feeding, and secondly, the giving of additional feeds of sop made with bread or biscuit, oatmeal or cornflour, usually on the recommendation of the grandmother. Both of these evils result in digestive disturbance, and often end with causing wasting disease. "However, quite recently when one of the Health Visitors called at a certain house, she found the mother and her first baby, aged 3 weeks, at breakfast. The mother was having bacon and eggs, and the baby, bacon fat, and the yolk of egg." — (? A forerunner of 'modern' ideas on infant feeding which allow minced meat, etc. after a few weeks.) Deaths of children under one year included 204, from diarrhoea and enteritis, 45 from measles and 92 from pneumonia. There were 199 inquests on children under five years, 35 deaths being attributed to convulsions, 40 to overlying by parents in bed, and 12 to burns and scalds. Notifications of infectious disease included 848 diphtheria; 2,009 scarlet fever; 44 enteric fever, and 1,230 new cases of tuberculosis. Almost ten per cent of the cases of tuberculosis notified during the year died before the end of the year. 7 Of the 1,237 samples of food analysed 139 (11.2&) were found to be adulterated, as a result of which 65 prosecutions were taken. 108 samples of milk and 16 samples of butter were found to be adulterated, and of 110 samples of milk taken on Sundays 11.5% were adulterated. Legal proceedings were taken in 109 instances under the Public Health Act, Food and Drugs Act and other Acts and Eyelaws. Inspections numbering 19,000 were made by Sanitary Inspectors specifically for the purpose of detecting overcrowding. Population The Registrar-General's mid-year estimate for 1964 is 91,130. Last year's estimate was 89,930. The density of population is now 51,60 persons per acre. In 1914 it was 156 per acre. Marriages The number of marriages in the Borough during the year was 662, being 118 less than last year. The marriage rate per thousand population is 14.5 compared with 17.3 in 1963. Claims for Sickness Benefit The numbers of claims for sickness benefit to the local office of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, covering the E.l postal district, are given below for each month of the year, with comparisons for 1962 and 1963: 1964 1963 1962 January 1,721 1,933 2,425 February 1,667 2,414 1,615 March 1,186 1,642 1,470 April 1,238 1,307 1,420 May 1,196 1,081 1,052 June 945 1,021 1,072 July- 937 919 864 August 1,302 1,110 838 September 1,189 1,020 1,233 October 1,734 1,091 1,252 November 1,383 1,445 1,237 December 1,072 1,444 1,494 Total for Yea rs 15,570 16,427 15,972 8 Unemployment The Ministry of Labour has kindly supplied rue with the following information as to the estimated number of persons residing in the Borough who were registered as unemployed at the end of the years- Men Boys Women Girls 1,075 36 90 5 Total; 1,206 The total number of unemployed at the end of 1963 was 1,913. Open Spaces There are now 77 acres of parks and open spaces within the Borough, an increase of over 50 per cent in the last ten years. This represents 0.85 of an acre for every 1,000 population. The County of London plan provides for 4 acres within the County per 1,000 population, with an interim standard of acres. A list of the sites is given on page 69. Comparative Statistics A Table showing vital statistics for the Borough at various years from 1901, is on page 66. 9 II. GENERAL PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES Aged Persons Welfare The Council is empowered by Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951, to make application to a court of summary jurisdiction for an Order for the removal to a hospital or institution of any aged, infirm or physically incapacitated person living in insanitary conditions and who is in need of care and attention. This year it was found necessary to apply for four such Orders tinder this enactment, in respect of old persons who were removed to hospital. Voluntary admission to a hospital or institution was obtained for 22 other persons. Two women officers, both State Registered Nurses and one a certificated Health Visitor, were employed for visiting aged persons in the Borough, and 2,349 visits were made by these officers during the year. One officer resigned in July and had not been replaced by the end of the year. A Register of all old persons visited is kept in the Department. .Amendments made to the register during the year were as follows:- Number on Register at 1st January, 1964 2,543 Additions during the year 501 Removals during the year 237 Number on Register at 31st December, 1964 2,807 The Department continued operating a Laundry Service for the chronic sick who are unable by reason of ill-health, senility, etc. to keep their personal laundry and bed linen in a clean condition. During the year, 5,056 articles of bed linen were dealt with. In order to prevent injury, or danger of injury, to health, Section 43 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1953, operated by the Borough Council, makes provision for the personal cleansing in their own homes of aged persons who are verminous or otherwise in need of bathing. 1,105 baths were given to 103 old people during the year by the Council's Home Bathing Service, which was inaugurated in 1950. Liaison is maintained with statutory and voluntary bodies, e.g. the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, London County Council, National Assistance Board, local Hospitals and particularly with Dr.C.P.Silver, the local Consultant Geriatrician. An example of liaison which exists, is that Hospitals notify this Department when an old person is about to be discharged so that any welfare services can be arranged beforehand, such as a home help, meals-on-wheels, etc. 10 The Council's contribution to the Old People's Welfare Services in the Borough for the year 1964-5 amounted to approximately £25,000, which included grants for the mobile meals service, old people's holidays, workrooms, administrative expenses of the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association and grants to various old people's clubs. There are 17 old people's clubs in the Borough, all affiliated to the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association.* One club closed during the year. The Council is represented on the Association by the Chairman of the Public Health Committee and other members of the Council and by the Medical Officer of Health. A list of clubs and the facilities thereat will be found on page 70. The Mobile Meals Service operated by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, the Women's Voluntary Service and the Beaumont Hall Settlement, increased their deliveries to a weekly average of 1,054 meals to home-bound old people. Five vehicles are employed in this service. Sight of the old people's clubs which include luncheon clubs among their facilities, provided an average of 828 meals every week. The W.V.S. Kitchen provided over 50,000 meals during the year, some 22,000 for the mobile service. A Utilabus purchased by the Association during the year with the aid of a grant from the Council is employed in many activities, transporting elderly infirm persons to lunch and social clubs and workrooms for the elderly, to film shows, outings and summer holidays. A Chiropody Service is provided by the Stepney Old People's Welfare Association at clinics situated in three of the old people's clubs in the Borough, and an average of 274 treatments including 127 domiciliary treatments were given each month during the year, an increase of 25 per cent over last year. Anbulance Facilities The London County Council is responsible under Section 27 of the National Health Service Act 1946, for the provision of Ambulance transport within the administrative County of London. Conferences The Council was represented at the following Conferences during the year:- (*) Hen.Secretary, The Stepney Old People's Welfare Association, Limehouse Town Hall, Commercial Road, E.14.

Deceased Persons Inquests Inquests were held on 54- residents of the Borough during the year, the verdicts being: '7 deaths due to road accidents, 26 other accidents, 12 suicides, 3 acute alcoholism, 1 misadventure, 1 murder, 1 natural causes, 2 open verdicts, and 1 unascertainable. Burials Section--50 of the National Assistance Act 1948 places a duty on the Council to arrange for the burial of any person found dead within the Borough, where no private arrangements have been made. 25 such burials took place during the year - 23 adults, 1 infant and one stillborn child at a cost of £299, of which £229 was recovered by the end of the year, 12 either from the estates of the deceased persons or from liable relatives or by way of grants made under the National Insurance Act 1946. 23 requests for burial came from H.M.Coroner's Officer and two from relatives of the deceased. Disposal of contents of homes It is often necessary where persons living alone have died in the Borough, to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in conjunction with the relatives of the deceased or with the Treasury Solicitor, where there are no known relatives, and has the effect of releasing accommodation for housing purposes as soon as possible. Transport of bodies abroad From time to time certificates are issued regarding bodies being transported abroad, to the effect that the deceased did not die from an infectious disease and that the coffin had been hermetically sealed. Four such certificates were issued this year, relating to bodies flown to Israel for burial. Free Washing Facilities The Council provides free washing facilities in 16 of the 22 public conveniences in the Borough. Health Education The Department's poster-boards were used to display various posters, during the year, as well as the Council's official notice boards and those affixed to lamp-columns in street markets in the Borough. Each month a different topic is chosen, to coincide either with a national or county campaign or at a time of year when the incidence of a particular health hazard is increased. The occupiers of several large factories and some chemists shops accept posters for display and leaflets for distribution. With the co-operation of the Borough Librarian, bookmarks and leaflets on various health subjects were distributed from the Lending Section of the Libraries. . In all, some 3,300 posters and 17,000 leaflets were distributed. Monthly bulletins, giving details of the incidence of infectious disease and data supplied by the local office of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance on persons claiming sick benefit, plus health propaganda material for surgery waiting-rooms, were circulated to the local general practitioners and hospitals. A special campaign was conducted during the "fireworks" season, warning the public to exercise care in the use of pyrotechnics. Publicity was also given to the Council's Holiday Centre by means of advertisements in the Press, slides shown in local cinemas and by psters and leaflets. Vacant sites in the Borough were posted-up with notices warning the public against the depositing of rubbish and against the use of land as caravan sites. 13 Subjects publicised included home safety, the relationship between smoking and health, diphtheria immunisation, vaccination against poliomyelitis, smallpox, food hygiene, influenza, and the care of the.elderly. Holiday Centre During the year, 1,240 Stepney residents spent a holiday at the Council's Holiday Centre, The Manor House, Sandgate, near Folkestone, Kant. This number included 828 aged persons and 126 children. The total number of weekly bookings was 1,444, the highest since the Manor House was opened in 1958. The Holiday Centre is open all the year round and is available to all residents of the Borough, young and old, the latter being alioted half the total accommodation each weak. Coach transport is provided to and from the Manor House and the Public Health Department. The management and control of the Holiday Centre is vested in the Council's Physical Training and Recreation Committee and the day-to-day administration is the responsibility of the Medical Officer of Health. The intensive.publicity measures taken in the autumn, as well as personal contact by. the Department's hygiene officers, resulted in a considerable increase in Winter bookings. Hospital Facilities The undermentioned hospitals are situated in the Borough: No.of Beds -The London Hospital, Whitechapel Road 685 Mile End Hospital, Bancroft Road 476 London Jewish Hospital, Stepney Green 128 East End Maternity Hospital, Commercial Road 58 Information Centre The Council operates an Information Service for the public at the Municipal Offices', 227-233, Commercial Road, S.l (telephone No. STS.1818) Two Citizens' Advice Bureaux which obtain financial support from the Council opened last year at Toynbee Hall, Commercial Street and at Dame Colet House, Ben Jonson Road.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES The District Public Health Inspectors served 1,971 Notices during the year, and in 80 cases legal proceedings were employed to enforce compliance therewith. At the end of the year there were five vacancies in the establishment of Public Health Inspectors. Aspects of the work of the inspectors not covered in the following paragraphs will be found in the statistical appendix, pages 53-55. Certificates of Disrepair (Rent Act, 1957) During the year, ten applications under the Rent Act 1957 were received from tenants for Certificates of Disrepair, 7 certificates being issued. Clean Air The Borough's sixth Smoke Control Order under the Clean Air Act 1956 was made by the Council on 19th November 1964. At the end of the year the Minister's confirmation of Areas Nos. 5 and 6 was awaited. Areas Nos. 5 and 6 comprise 445 acres, with 7,043 dwellings and 759 industrial and other premises. The number of heating appliances in dwellings which are in regular use and which require replacement or adaptation, is 1,680. There is, in the Public Health Offices, a Smoke Control Exhibition open to the public in which various types of approved space-heating and cooking appliances and authorised fuels are displayed. Arrangements are also made with the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation for their Demonstration Van to tour each Smoke Control Area for a week immediately prior to the date when the Order comes into operation. Facing this page is a map showing the Smoke Control Areas established in the Borough. Under the provisions of Section 3(3) of the Clean Air Act 1956, a furnace may not be installed in a building unless notice of proposal to install has been given to the Council. Notices were given to the Council of prop sal to install furnaces in 15 premises. Measurements of air pollution are taken regularly in the Borough by means of lead peroxide instruments, which give monthly records of the concentration of sulphur in the air, and also by combined smoke filters and volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus which afford daily readings. Details of visits and inspections made by the Smoke and Factories Inspector are given on page 56. 19 Consumer Protection Act, 1961 In order to prevent or reduce risk of death or injury, this Act authorises the making of regulations imposing safety requirements relating to any prescribed class of goods. The Oil Heaters Regulations 1962 made under this Act impose such requirements in respect of domestic kerosene burning space-heaters manufactured after 1st June, 1962. The following resolution was submitted by the Council from the Health Committee to the National/Safety Conference: "This committee understands that the sale of oil heaters manufactured before 1st June, 1962 is not subject to the Oil Heaters Regulations 1962 made under the provisions, of Section 1 of the Consumer Protection Act 1961; that it has been brought to the notice of the committee that the sale of secondhand heaters is increasing, many of which are defective and extremely dangerous following repairs or modifications carried out by previous owners and/or imcompetent dealers; that it should be an offence for a person to sell, or to have in his possession for the purpose of sale a heater which was manufactured before 1st June, 1962 and which is defective, or which does not conform to the standards set by the Oil Heaters Regulations 1962; and that representations be made to the Secretary of State for the existing legislation to be amended accordingly." The resolution was carried and it is understood that amending Regulations are now in course of preparation. The Heating Appliances (Fireguards) Regulations 1953 require fireguards of prescribed standards of construction and fitting, to be fitted to gas and electric fires and oil heaters. Drainage and Sanitary Conveniences Considerable use is made of Section 25(l) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1955, whereby a public health inspector can serve a notice requiring an owner to clear an obstructed drain within 48 hours and if the notice is not complied with during that time, the Council may themselves execute the work and recover the cost from the person responsible. Notices under this section served during the year numbered 173, the Council executing the work in 37 instances. Factories Under Section 153 of the Factories Act 1961, the Medical Officer of Health is required among other things to report to the Council in his annual report specifically on, and furnish the prescribed particulars with respect to, matters under the Act administered by the Council. Particulars will be found in the appendix, pages 57 and 58. Hairdressers and Barbers Persons shall not carry on the business of barber or hairdresser unless they and their premises are registered by the Council. The number 20 of premises and persons registered at the end of the year were 123 and 132, respectively. Inspections numbering 150 were made during the year to ensure that the Byelaws made by the Council for the conduct of these premises were not infringed. Legal Proceedings Legal proceedings instituted during the year (other than those relating to food premises), showing penalties imposed, were as follows: No. of Summonses Fines Costs £ s d £ s d Housing Act, 1961: Contravention of Direction Orders (Section 19) 3 8. 0. 0 4. 17. 6 Contravention of Regulations 41 422. 0. 0 56. 7. 0 Housing Act, 1957: Overcrowding in Houses in Multiple Occupation 26 208. 0. 0 47. 4. 0 Public Health (London) Act, 1936: Nuisance Orders 49 8. 0. 0 154. 13. 0 Non-compliance with Nuisance Orders 20 44. 0. 0 29. 2. 0 Rag Flock & Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 2 20. 0. 0 7. 0. 0 London County Council (General Powers) Act 1959, Section 22 (Using unlicensed land for siting caravans) 2 10. 0. 0 3. 7. 0 Noise Abatement Act, 1960 2 4. 0. 0 3. 13. 0 Stepney Borough Council Byelaws: (Yard Paving) 3 12. 0. 0 7. 0. 0 (Staircase Lighting) 2 2. 0. 0 4. 0. 0 Totals: 150 £738. 0. 0 £317. 3. 6 (Details of other legal proceedings taken will be found on page 36). 21 Lodging Houses - Common There are three common lodging houses in the Borough, providing accommodation for 726 persons as follows:- 10/22, Johnson Street (Church Army) 175 Men 177, Whitechapel Road (Salvation Army) 323 " Hostel for Women, Hopetown Street (Salvation Army) 228 Women The premises are inspected regularly to ensure that the byelaws relating thereto are complied with. Lodging Houses - Seamen Two such premises in the Borough provide accommodation for 396 seamen as follows:- Sailors Home & Red Ensign Club, Ensign Street and Dock Street 243 Seamen Empire Memorial Hostel, 747, Commercial Road 153 " Regular inspections are also carried out at these premises. Lodging Houses - Other In addition to the licensed common and seamen's lodging houses, there are two other premises in the Borough which provide lodgings but which are not subject to licensing or registration - namely, Tower House and Providence Row Night Refuge. Tower House (formerly known as "Rowton House"), which was opened in 1902, provides accommodation for 694 men and Providence Rew Night Refuge for 77 men, women and children. Motor Cycles (Protective Helmets) Regulations. 1963 These Regulations prescribe British Standards Specifications to which protective helmets must conform when sold or offered for sale. Sale of helmets not conforming with the Standards constitutes an offence under Section 221 of the Road Traffic Act 1960. Noise Abatement Act. 1960 The London County Council (General Powers) Act 1937 made provisions for excessive, unreasonable or unnecessary noise which is injurious or dangerous to health to be a noise nuisance which may be dealt with summarily under the Public Health (London) Act 1936. The Noise Abatement Act 1960 amended the provisions to 'any noise which is a nuisance' and included vibration within the term. The Act also restricts the operation on the highway of loudspeakers (which includes ice-cream vendors' chimes). 22 The frequency with which complaints of noise nuisance were received this year showed a slight increase. The group giving the greatest cause for complaint were transport contractors' depots - particularly those where operations are carried on throughout the night. The noises complained of were revving engines, shouting instructions to drivers, loading and unloading. Other complaints referred mainly to industrial processes. Representations made to the proprietors of the firms concerned usually had the desired effect. In 5 instances formal notices under the Act were served. Notices Served Notices served, during the year, under the various Acts and Byelaws wire as follows:- Public Health (London) Act 1936, Section 82 ... ... 1,4-06 " " 40 68 " "106 2 " "109 2 Factories Act 1961 74 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 40 London County Council (General Powers) Act 1954, Section 18 87 London County Council (General Powers) Act 1955, Section 25 178 " " 26 13 " " 27 2 Noise Abatement Act 1960 5 London County Council (Drainage) Byelaws 27 " (Poultry Slaughterhouse) Byelaws 8 Stepney Council (Staircase Lighting) Byelaws 21 " (Yard Paving) Byelaws 20 " (Hairdressers) Byelaws 16 " (Cleansing of Storage Cisterns) Byelaws 1 London County Council Byelaws re Demolition of Buildings 1 1,971 Outworkers Employers of outworkers in the Borough in certain specified occupations are required, by the provisions of Section 133 of the Factories Act 1961, to supply the Council in February and August each year with a list of the names and addresses of all persons employed by them as outworkers during the preceding six months. Where the outworker resides in another area, the Council is required to forward details to the Local Authority for that area. It is an offence to fail to submit lists of outworkers or to give out work to be done in a place which is considered to be injurious to the health of the persons employed therein. Two such contraventions were discovered during the year, the employers being cautioned. 23 There are 401 premises on the Register, 39 less than last year. Number of firms in the Borough employing outworkers 37 " outworkers residing in, and employed by firms in, the Borough 204 " outworkers residing outside, and employed by firms in the Borough 553 " outworkers residing in, and employed by firms outside the Borough 197 Offensive Businesses There are 18 offensive businesses in the Borough. The Register comprises the following premises:- Dresser of Furskins (l): 34/38, Brodlove Lane Poultry Slaughterhouses (17): 19, Bell Lane* 75, Hessel Street 28, Bursiem Street 7, Leyden Street " 161, Cannon Street Road 10b, Leyden Street * 163, Camion Street Road* 13, Leyden Street l6/l8, Cobb Street 15, Leyden Street 14, Hessel Street 7, Lower Hessel Street* 21/22, Hessel Street 4, Monthope Street * (Lower Market)* 6, Monthope Street* 36, Hessel Street 10a, Monthope Street. (*Establishment Orders on these premises are subject to renewal from time to tine). The poultry slaughterhouse at 82, Stepney Way was demolished during the year. Inspection of the premises was carried out on 66 occasions and eight Notices served relating to contraventions of the Byelaws. Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 The Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, a measure which brings working conditions in offices and shops under a far more comprehensive and more stringent scheme of control than hitherto, came into force during the year. Between April and July, the Ministry of Labour carried out a national scheme to publicise the requirements relating to registration of premises. This took the form of BBC announcements, leaflets to employers through their organisations and trade journals, a TV film, poster displays at local government offices, post offices and employment exchanges. These measures did not, however, have the desired effect. It was therefore decided to carry out a complete survey of every office and shop in the Borough and registration forms (OSR. 1) were delivered by hand to 24 those known premises with employees. Where forms OSR.1 had not been returned after a reasonable period had elapsed, a reminder was sent in which the requirements of the Act were indicated together with the provisions relating to penalties for non-compliance. Advertisements notifying the public of the registration requirements were also inserted in the local press. Subsequently, a total of 1,626 registrations were received by the end of the year out of an estimated total of 2,000 premises. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining accurately completed forms OSR.1 from many of the smaller businesses. This was, of course, particularly so in the case of those traders who wrote little or no English. Changes of occupation were frequently found to occur. Accordingly liaison with the Borough Treasurer has been extended to ensure that all changes of rated occupiers are notified to the Public Health Department so that accurate registration can be maintained. Compliance with certain requirements of the Act has been made a condition when granting applications under the Town and Country Planning Act 1962 and the London County Council Drainage Byelaws. Similarly, reports are made to the Licensing Justices prior to the hearing of applications under the Betting, Gaming and Licensing Act 1963. At one large wholesale premises where a satisfactory first-aid room is maintained, exemption was granted from the requirements of Sections 24(l)-(6) of the Act. An application by the occupier of a coal order office for exemption from heating requirements was refused. Where premises are in multi-occupation (i.e. factories separately occupied, but sharing part of their accommodation with offices and/or shops) action is taken with regard to any contraventions of the Factories Act 1961 which are observed. Of the 681 premises which were generally inspected during the year, 94.8 per cent (64.6 premises) were found to fall short of the requirements of the Act and/or Orders and Regulations made thereunder. In all cases, letters were sent to the occupiers of the premises concerned drawing their notice to the matters requiring attention. Visits to grocers and butchers shops revealed large numbers of slicing machines which were inadequately guarded thus contravening the Prescribed Dangerous Machines Order 1964.. Occupiers were advised, to contact the suppliers of the machines in order to obtain suitable guards. Statistics relating to the inspections carried out during the year will be found on page 65. Pet Animals Act, 1951 There are 6 licensed pet shops in the Borough including stalls in markets. No contraventions were discovered of the conditions subject to which the annual licences are granted by the Council. 25 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 The sale of certain poisons (chiefly those used for sanitary domestic and horticultural purposes) by persons other than pharmacists is subject to the provisions of this Act and the Rules made thereunder. A person selling such poisons must have his name on a List kept by the Council and must make application annually for re-entry and pay a prescribed fee. Compliance must be made with the requirements relating to storage, transport, labelling and containers. There are 43 names on the Council's List, 82 visits to premises being made during the year. Radioactive Substances Act, 1960 As from 1st December 1963 persons who keep or use radioactive materials are, unless exempted, required to register with the Minister of Housing and Local Government and obtain authorisation from him for the accumulation or disposal of radioactive waste. Certificates of registration issued under Section 1 and authorisations under Sections 6 and 7 were issued by the Minister on three premises in the Borough. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act, designed to secure the use of clean filling materials in articles which are upholstered, stuffed or lined, requires the licensing or registration (as the case may be) of premises where rag flock is manufactured or stored or filling materials are used. Regulations made under the Act prescribe standards of cleanliness for filling materials. Premises registered for the use of filling materials number 13. The licences of two premises used for the storage of rag flock not being renewed this year use of the premises for the purpose was discontinued. Twelve samples of filling materials were obtained from registered premises during the year. The Analyst reported excessive chlorine content in a sample of rag flock and excessive trash content in one of cotton felt. Legal proceedings were instituted against the vendors for these offences, an absolute discharge being recorded in the former case on payment of £3.13.0 costs, and in the latter the vendor was fined £20 with £3.7.0 costs. Refuse Disposal The Public Cleansing Officer has kindly supplied the following information on refuse disposed of during the year:- House and Trade Refuse 39,984 Tons Street and Market Refuse 9,073 " Where possible refuse collection is carried out in the Borough by means 26 of 'Paladin' containers, mainly from blocks of flats. This method was adopted in 1955 since when 1,000 of these containers have been installed, which involves 120,000 collections during the year. The Cleansing Department carried out 31,255 cleansings of 5,093 street gullies by means of mechanical gully emptiers. Rodent Control In accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, statistics on rodent control work for surface infestations carried out by the Department during the year were submitted to the Ministry. In this period, 1,520 dwellings and other premises were inspected and 1,007 found to be infested with mice and rats. Treatments were carried out by the Department's rodent control staff in 909 properties found to be infested, the charges for servicing business premises amounting to £394. By the implementation of Section 4 of the Prevention of Carnage by Pests Act 1949, under which 40 Notices were.served during the year, it was found possible to clear bombed sites of refuse which would otherwise act as possible harbourage for rats and other vermin. Moreover, under the same section, which permits specified works to be carried out, it has been possible to require that sites be fenced in by the owners. Technical Circulars are issued periodically by the Infestation Control Laboratory of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Those issued during the year dealt with Sewer rat harbourage and building works; The Control of mice with Rodenticide dust; New rodenticide McN.1025 and Rat Control Planning. A copy of the Return furnished to the Ministry is shown on pages 51 and 52. The Council carries out on behalf of the Stepney Group Hospital Management Committee any necessary treatments for rodent infestation at hospitals and other premises in the Borough which come' under the control of that Committee. Water Supply The whole of the Borough is supplied with water by the Metropolitan Water Board, which is the authority responsible for its purity. The quantity and quality of water supplied by the Board during the year have been satisfactory. All the premises in the Borough are supplied individually direct from the public water mains. The number of instances where the water supply to premises was reinstated or repaired, following action taken by the Department, totalled 78, and the Metropolitan Water Board was notified on three 27 occasions where wastage of water took place. During the year 16 notices were received from the Metropolitan Water Board of withdrawal of water supply; in 10 premises for non-payment of rates and in 6 because of defects in the service. Water Certificates Water certificates as to new dwellings having a proper and sufficient supply of water were issued under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1936, in respect of 336 dwellings. Wells Bacteriological and chemical analyses of water from the four deep wells in use industrially in the Borough are made periodically and the results reported to this Department. All were reported as satisfactory. 28 IV. HOUSING Clearance Areas During the year, three Clearance Areas involving 39 houses were declared by the Borough Council. Closing Orders An appeal lodged against a Closing Order made by the Council in respect of a dwelling-house resulted in the Order being quashed. Overcrowding During the year 32 cases of alleged overcrowding in dwellings were investigated, nine of which were confirmed and referred to the London County Council. Overcrowding in houses in multiple occupation is referred to later in the report. Twelve overcrowded families were rehoused by the London County Council. The register of overcrowded premises was reduced, during the year, from 174 to 171 families. Underground Rooms There are approximately 1,250 underground rooms in the Borough used for living or sleeping purposes, of which 1,200 are unfit. During the year nine rooms were closed. Town and Country Planning (Housing Accommodation) Direction, 1952 Under this Order the Borough Council is consulted by the London County Council (the Planning Authority) before applications are determined for planning permission for development involving change of user of premises from use as a dwelling. Investigations of 11 such applications were carried out during the year. Applications for Rehousing At the end of the year there were 2,751 applications for rehousing on the Housing Manager's register. Those included the tenants of 213 Council dwellings who desired larger or smaller accommodation. Preferential Housing on Health Grounds Applications for preferential housing on health grounds investigated during the year, numbered 58. 29 Mobile Dwellings (including caravans) With the co-operation of the London County Council, 6 caravans were towed off a site in the Borough within ten days of arrival. In order to get on to the site the occupiers had broken down some corrugated iron fencing which had been erected some 18 months previously following the eviction of other caravan dwellers. If cleared sites are to be kept free from nuisance and unauthorised use it is imperative that they should be developed for planned use with greater expedition than at present obtains. A summons taken out against a caravanner who contravened. Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1959, by stationing his caravan on land which was not licensed for the purpose, resulted in a fine of £5 with costs of £3.7.0. Houses in Multiple Occupation Further progress was made during the year in dealing with houses in multiple occupation and in the use of the Council's powers under the provisions of Part II of the Housing Act 1961 and Regulations made thereunder. Management Orders were made with respect to 58 premises following the service of 92 notices of intention to make such orders. 41 summonses were heard during the year respecting contraventions of the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations 1962, resulting in fines of £422 being imposed with costs amounting to £56.7.0. Necessary works to remedy conditions caused by neglect of management were completed in 137 houses. Notices numbering 35 were served under the provisions of Section 90 of the Housing Act 1957 for permitting overcrowding in houses in multiple occupation. 26 summonses were issued for contravention of notices, resulting in fines of £208 with costs of £47.4.0 being imposed. Many visits in the late evening and early hours of the morning are necessary to check that these notices are being complied with. Fifteen directions were made under Section 19 of the Housing Act 1961 to prevent or reduce overcrowding. Three summonses were subsequently issued for contravention of the directions, the cases being proven and fines of £8 imposed with costs of £4.17.6. Standard Grants and Improvements In conjunction with officers of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department, the Housing Inspector inspected 15 premises regarding which applications had been made to the Council for standard or improvement grants. 30 New Housing During the year 336 new permanent dwellings were completed in the Borough - 24 by the Borough Council, 281 by the County Council and 31 by private enterprise. (See appendix, page 68). A total of 9,590 new permanent dwellings have now been constructed in the Borough since the war - 6,501 by the London County Council, 2,756 by the Borough Council, 69 by the Corporation of London and 264 by private enterprise. At the end of, the year units of accommodation owned by the Council numbered 4,508, comprising 4,076 erected by the Council and 432 formerly requisitioned and other premises purchased. Statistics A summary of inspections made by the Housing Inspector is given on page 56 - and further Housing statistics will be found on pages 59 and 60. 31 V. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD During the year 29 samples of fruit and vegetables (14 English and 15 imported) were submitted for analyses for pesticide residues; all revealed no evidence of such residues. Samples of Italian and other imported canned tomato paste were submitted for examination for the presence of excessive mould. In each case the amount of the Howard Mould Count was under the permitted level of mould in 50 per cent of fields. This is an example of the successful procedure established to detain imports of this paste for analyses of samples, as a result of which the manufacturers are now taking steps to keep down the level of mould in their product. On 5th December, 1964, Bishopsgate Goods Station was extensively damaged by fire. This has terminated one of the important activities of the food inspectors, namely the examination of foodstuffs imported from the Continent, an activity which has spanned nearly forty years. Imported fruit, vegetables, fresh and canned meats, bacon and other foodstuffs, were all subject to inspection. It is too early to say where and when a permanent railway depot to handle these imports will be built; at present they are being dealt with at other depots. Towards the end of the year, the London Board of Shechita, whose tenancy of cattle slaughterhouses terminated at the Central Meat Market, Islington, opened a Kosher Meat Depot at 54/56, Comercial Road. Cattle, sheep and veal carcases, forequarters and offals are brought to the new Depot from slaughterhouses at Beckton, Saffron Walden and Birkenhead, and are handled by five meat wholesalers for distribution to London's Kosher retail butchers. Routine visits are now made for the examination of the meat and offals at the Depot and for compliance with the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960. Three samples of imported groundnuts in shell were taken during the year for analysis for aflotoxin and were found to be free from this. Imports will be subjected to detention and sampling for analysis for the presence of aflotoxin, a substance which may occur in broken and mouldy groundnuts in shell. Few Legislation (a) Pasteurised Liquid Egg. The Liquid Egg (Pasteurisation) Regulations, 1963, which require that bulk liquid egg be pasteurised, came into force on 1st January, 1964. There are new two egg pasteurising plants in the Borough, the second of which began working in April. It is used only on occasions when an abundance of shell eggs makes it economical to do so. 32 The year's working at the other plant is a success story; the factory, its plant and operation continue to be an attraction to commercial undertakings, as well as to Government and Local Authorities, from all over the world. The experience of this factory which produces 5,000 gallons a day is that the dislike and opposition of bakers, encountered earlier in the year, to the thin and watery appearance of the product has been largely overcome. The better reliability and baking qualities of pasteurised egg cause it now to be often preferred to frozen egg. During, those months of the year when shell eggs are not plentiful, large quantities of tinned frozen eggs are defrosted and pasteurised. With this practice in mind the firm in question has recently fitted a special magnetic filter in the production line. This is in addition to the existing filter and has already been found useful in detecting small pieces and flakes of tin. During the year 27 samples of pasteurised egg were taken from these plants, all satisfying the Alpha-amylase Test. (b) Bread and Flour Regulations, 1963. These Regulations, which lay down requirements as to the composition of different kinds of bread, came into force on 1st September 1964. Six samples of bread were taken for analysis and found to be genuine. (c) Meat (Treatment) Regulations), 1964. These Regulations, which came into operation on 23rd January 1964, prohibit the addition to raw and unprocessed meat intended for sale for human consumption of ascorbic, erythorbic or nicotinic acids or their salts or other derivatives and the sale of any such meat so treated. (d) Mineral Hydrocarbons in Food Regulations, 1964. These Regulations revoke and replace the Mineral Oil in Food Order 1949, and prohibit with certain exceptions the use of mineral hydrocarbons in the composition or preparation of food. (e) Dried Milk Regulations.1964 and Soft Drinks Regulations. 1964. These Regulations re-enact with amendments as to composition, declaration as to contents, etc. previous regulations made between 1923 and 1963. (f) Proposals for regulations announced during the year, following recommendations of the Food Standards Committee, included those relating to standards of meat content for canned meats and meat pies, review of the Colouring Matter in Food Regulations 1957, and review of the Labelling of Food Order 1953. Lead in Lettuce Early in the year, sections of the national Press carried stories of the large quantities of lead found in lettuces. Samples were immediately taken from various shops in the Borough and submitted for analysis. The Public Analyst reported that excess of lead was present in the lettuces as received but that it was easily removed in the ordinary process of washing. 33 Bacteriological Examination of Foodstuffs Samples submitted for bacteriological examination numbered 214. These comprised 53 samples of desiccated coconut, 77 imported dried and frozen egg, 19 ice cream, 4 ice lollies, 8 tuberculin tested (pasteurised) milk, 10 pasteurised milk, 1 sterilised milk, 10 cream pastries, 3 synthetic cream, 1 beef sausages, 1 animal food, 8 pork luncheon meat, 3 Chinese frozen prawns, 2 cooked chicken, 1 cooked steak, 1 dried milk powder and 12 swabs from utensils at a bacon factory. Suspected Food Poisoning Following a complaint that four persons were ill with sickness and diarrhoea after eating chocolate eclairs purchased at a local bakery, investigations at the bakehouse revealed that, due to the pastrycook being absent on holiday, all the cakes and pastries sold in the shop that week had been manufactured and supplied by another baker in the Borough. Sampling of assorted cream pastries, synthetic cream, etc. at this bakehouse showed similar contamination to that found in the eclairs. Nasal and skin swabs were taken from employees at the bakery and Staph.aureus found to be present in four swabs, three from bakers and one from a shop assistant. The affected employees were requested to attend their doctors for treatment, who were also informed. Examination of faeces from the affected persons proved to be negative. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations. 1960 Inspections of food premises by the Fublic Health Inspectors (Food) to ensure that the provisions of the Food Hygiene Regulations were being observed, numbered 3,992 during the year, Notices served requiring works to be done to comply with the Regulations totalled 404. No applications were made during the year for certificates exempting premises from complying with any of the provisions of the Regulations. Notes on the Regulations for the advice of caterers printed in Italian, Greek, Urdu, Bengali, Chinese and Turkish, were distributed together with "Wash Your Hands" notices in the same languages to Cafe proprietors in the area.
