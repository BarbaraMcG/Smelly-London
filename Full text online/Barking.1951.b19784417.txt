Of this total 12 died within the first month of life, with prematurity being given as the cause of death in 8 of these cases. Not one of these deaths occurred amongst illegitimate children. The infant mortality rate for Barking for 1951 is 15.49 and the table on this page gives the rates for the past 25 years. Although it gives me great pleasure to report this new record, I would like to point out that definite trends should not be gauged from the statistics of any one year in a town the size of Barking. It is comforting to know, however, that the average infant mortality rate in Barking for the past 5 years is 24.4. This is below the rates for England and Wales for the same period. Page 8 the prevalence of and control over infectious and other diseases Notification The following is a summary of the cases notified during the year:— Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis 6 Dysentery 50 Erysipelas 15 Food Poisoning 17 Measles 1,713 Pneumonia 46 Puerperal Pyrexia 10 Scabies 21 Scarlet Fever 86 Typhoid Fever 1 Whooping Cough 276 No difficulty was met in arranging for the admission of cases to hospital, and most cases went to Ilford Isolation and Rush Green Hospitals. Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis Of the six cases notified, three developed paralytic symptoms— fortunately the disease did not prove fatal in any case. Diphtheria l am happy to record that during the year not one single case of diphtheria occurred in Barking. The following figures give the percentages of children, in various age groups, who had been immunised at the end of the year:— 5 years 55.4% 5—15 87.2% 0—15 75.0% Page 9 Scarlet Fever In a report of the World Health Organisation, dated 18th April, 1952, it is stated there has been an increasing number of cases of scarlet fever in Europe during the last few years. Fortunately there is a simultaneous decrease in mortality, so that in actual fact the disease is not now a source of anxiety to us in spite of the increase in the number of cases. This increase is localised to certain areas and certain countries. Barking for instance has escaped entirely. Notifications have remained more or less stationary since 1944 and there was one death attributable to the disease in 1944 and one in 1945, but none since. In England and Wales the notifications have remained more or less stationary since 1945, but there have been up to 37 deaths in 1951 (there were 33 deaths from diphtheria). Scotland and Ireland on the contrary have experienced quite severe epidemics in 1948 and 1949. It is pleasing to record that the position in Barking is so satisfactory, in comparison with other areas. Tuberculosis Mass Miniature Radiography. During the year a survey was carried out in Barking. A total of 11,454 people were photographed and of this number there were 329 who were re-examined because the miniature film was not in all respects satisfactory. The following table shows the findings of the survey:— Cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Male Female Total Active Primary — 1 1 Active Post Primary 5 2 7 Inactive Primary 91 53 144 Inactive Post Primary 66 38 104 Pleural Effusion 1 — 1 163 94 257 Page 10 In addition to the findings with regard to pulmonary tuberculosis it is interesting to note that the following cases showed abnormalities of the chest:— Abnormality Male Female Total Pneumokoniosis 4 2 6 Cystic disease of lungs 1 — 1 Calcified wall of aortic knuckle 1 - 1 Diaphragmatic hernia — 2 2 Bullous cyst — 1 1 Bronchiectasis 7 2 9 Cardiovascular lesions:— Acquired 19 16 35 Congenital — 1 1 Pneumonitis 3 - 3 Tuberculosis Register. During the year a total of 113 cases were added to the register and 127 were removed, giving a net decrease of 14. food Poisoning Of the 17 cases of food poisoning notified, 8 were in respect of the members of two unrelated families involved in two separate minor outbreaks, whilst the remainder were single cases. In two single cases only was the causative agent identified, viz. Salmonella typhi-murium, and one of these cases related to an employee of a travelling fair, who took his discharge from hospital against medical advice in order to rejoin the fair when it moved to the Midlands.

WATER SUPPLY The whole of the water supplied to domestic dwellings is drawn from the main supply of the South Essex Waterworks Company. Samples wet submitted monthly for bacteriological examination and bi-annually for chemical examination, all of which were found to be pure and wholesons In addition samples drawn from the wells at 3 factory premises have also been examined and found satisfactory. DRAINAGE AND SEWERAGE No change has taken place since my last report. The whole of the sewage is dealt with at the works of the London County Council. PUBLIC CLEANSING AND REFUSE DISPOSAL It is to be regretted that negotiations with neighbouring authority for the disposal of their refuse with our own at an approved site in the area have reached a stalemate. At this juncture it is difficult to foresee whether or not the matter may be further discussed. In the meantime the Jenkins Lane tip is remaining in use. Page 14 72,035 yards of refuse were collected during the year with an average weight of 5.47 cwts. per yard, the total weight being 19,539 tons and this, together with 46,587 tons from the Borough of Ilford, was tipped at Jenkins Lane. The provisions of the Essex County Council Act with regard to tips continue in force. dustbin ownership by the corporation At the end of the year dustbins were being maintained and supplied in accordance with Section 75(3) of the Public Health Act, 1936 at 5,801 premises. Owing to the present shortage of materials it is no longer possible to maintain the Council's standard which required these receptacles to be galvanised. As a substitute they are now rustproofed with phosphate and eradication of bed bugs I am able to say that the improvement in the general standard of cleanliness to which I referred in my last report still continues. The number of properties treated with insecticide being 33 of which 18 were under the Bcontrol of the Corporation. FLY NUISANCE Spray treatment of refuse tips, piggeries, stables, and vacant lands was again carried cut during the summer months. The experience of the past two seasons convinces me that the operations Carried out by the mobile spraying unit have been of immense benefit to the whole of the Borough. It is hoped to extend this service during 1952. PREV ENTION OF DAMAGE BY PEST ACT, 1949 rodent controi in sfwers The bi-annual treatment of sewers was carried out as usual in the months of May and November with the following results. May November Number of manholes baited 422 422 Number showing prebait take 211 221 Number showing complete Drebait take 134 147 Test baiting of 70 manholes on the new housing estates was carried out October. The results showed infestation to a minor degree. Page 15 SURFACE INFESTATION The following is a copy of the report furnished to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for the Year 1951. 1.

Our campaign to encourage the use of smokeless fuels or more efficient grates continues, but progress is slow largely due to the shortage of smokeless fuel, its cost, and the restricted production of more efficient grates. DEPOSIT gauges The marked difference between the Barking Park reading and the readings from the other two parks will be noted. This demonstrates the effect of the prevailing winds upon the soot fall in different parts of the Borough. Parsloes Park and Greatfields Park are in the path of the prevailing wind blowing from the S.W. from the industrial area which includes Becton Gas Works, and the Electricity Generating Station. Work is continuing on the new Section of the Generating Station and it is hoped that when the new boiler house comes into use it will be possible to overhaul some of the obsolete equipment in the older boiler houses with a consequent reduction in the pollution arising from the station. Your officers make frequent observations on industrial chimneys and contraventions of your Smoke Bye-laws were dealt with. Usually discussions with the management and the boiler operatives result in an improvement but it is very apparent that without the supervision exercised by your officers the pollution would rapidly increase. atmospheric corrosion of metals We have been requested by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to provide a site for two pieces of apparatus for measuring atmospheric corrosion of metals. On the authority of the Parks Committee the apparatus has been placed in Greatfields Park for a period of one year.

In one case plans are in hand to house a dust producing process in a suitable building with the object of preventing the dissemination of dust over adjoining land and premises. In another case where a chemical process caused a smell nuisance the Company was asked to provide suitable equipment so that the process could be carried out in a closed circuit. It was found by them to be impossible to do this satisfactorily in their premises in Barking and it is anticipated that early in 1952 the company will discontinue operations in the Borough. Complaints were received regarding the effects of the effluent gases from an acid producing plant recently erected in the Borough. The process was registered with the Alkali Works Inspector, but disclosed certain "teething troubles"; these were later remedied. It is, however, an unfortunate fact that although the effluent gas may comply with the Statutory Limitatior there may still be some discomfort to those inhaling it. Fortunately, the plant is relatively isolated, and the wind rarely blows in the direction of the nearest occupied houses. SWIMMING BATHS AND POOL East Street Bath.—This bath was used by 65,595 bathers during the open season of 22 weeks. Of this number 35,500 were children. Open Air Pool.—The pool was used by 62,459 bathers including 36,600 children. Samples of the water were taken as follows:— East Street Bath 14 Open Air Pool 10 South East Essex Technical College 20 All the samples were found to be satisfactory, and safe for swimming THE CARE OF THE ELDERLY The increasing number of old persons in the community and the thin dividing line between the sick and feeble of the upper age groups are creating new problems which afford a good example of the inseparability of health and social welfare. Page 20 In these circumstances it is unfortunate that the year has passed without progress being made upon the re-development of St. Paul's Church Site. This joint venture of the Essex County Council Welfare Committee and ourselves in a serious attempt to provide essential housing accommodation for the aged and sick is urgent and many old people are gravely disappointed with the delay. It will be some time before such ideal conditions are attained, and in the meantime the problem has to be dealt with, using the services we have available. It is right and proper that the care and attention required by persons who by reason of age or infirmity, are unable to look after themselves, should come from their own family and in general this is found to be the case. Cases do arise, however, when children are heedless of their obligations to their parents, or where the old folk have no relatives; in such cases the Local Authority has to intervene. In many instances, it is possible to assist by arranging for domestic helps to give aid in the house. This appears to be the most satisfactory method, as old people generally are loth to leave familiar surroundings and prized possessions. In other instances conditions in the home may be so bad or the old person's health and habits may be such, that removal to hospital is necessary. In such cases action under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act 1948, may need to be taken to do this compulsorily. During 1951 action was taken in respect of one woman and three men who were unable to devote to themselves proper care and attention, and were not receiving such attention from other persons. All gave their consent to removal to hospital so that formal application to the Magistrates was not necessary. There were also twelve aged and infirm persons notified to the Essex bounty Council in the hope that they could be dealt with by that Welfare Authority. burial or cremation of the dead During the year the bodies of two deceased persons were disposed of ' ■ burial in accordance with the duties of the Local Authority under Subsection (I) 0f Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948. Page 21 ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL ACT, 1933, PART IV Massage and Special Treatment Establishments.—There are still four holders of licences to carry out massage and special treatment in the Borough All the premises and records are inspected. During the year it was not necessary to deal with any contraventions. INDUSTRIAL HEALTH The importance of the health care of workers in industry was one of the valuable lessons learnt during both wars. Factory inspection and protection from dangerous industrial processes are, of course, functions of the central government, but the environmental and sanitary conditions are matters for the Council in factories, shops, offices and workshops. Apart however from private arrangements by very large factories, personal health supervision has been minimal. FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following statistics show the results of the activities of the Sanitary Inspectors in the administration of this Act. 1.—Inspections for purposes of provisions as to health.

There is a tendency, owing to specialisation to forget our main objective, i.e. the highest standard of individual and national health and how to achieve it. Social life in large communities is only made possible by the control of environmental conditions. Organised public health had its origin in that fact, and began with the removal of evil conditions of living then prevailing. Environmental hygiene today connotes not only housing, water supply, sewage disposal and nuisances, but the individual's work, his food, his leisure and his relations with his neighbours. All in fact that enables the individual to live the good life. The acute shortage of sanitary inspectors available in the country has resulted in changes among the staff and always a deficiency on the establishment. The number of complaints received from residents in the Borough during the year was 1,830. This is a decrease when compared with a total of 1,996 for the year 1950. Your sanitary inspectors investigate every complaint lodged immediately. The following table shows the number of inspections made which resulted in the service of 2,709 preliminary notices and 446 statutory notices where the work required was not completed after the first intimation. In 77 instances the work remained uncompleted at the end of the year HEALTH EXHIBITION The high light of the year took place in April in the form of a Health Exhibition staged on quite an elaborate scale at the Baths Hall in association with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (Infestation Control Division) The following subjects were demonstrated by means of models, quiescent and in motion, photographs and drawings and machinery brought to the Exhibition Hall:—Environmental Hygiene, Housing, Public Cleansing Local Health Services, Domestic Heating, Clean Milk, Mass Radiography Ice-cream Production; Hygiene in Food Service; Hygienic and Construction Toys, Rodent Control and Household Pests. We were assisted in our Atmospheric Pollution display with exhibits from the Gas and Electricity industries, the Fuel Research Station and National Smoke Abatement Society. The Exhibition which received the support of over 6,000 people was of great educational value whilst effectively publicising the Council's health services.

RENT AND MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS ACT, 1920-39 Three applications were made by occupiers and three certificates issued. FOOD POISONING During the year a total of 17 cases were notified. 1 regret to report that the death of a visitor to the Borough from this cause occurred during the month of June. In this case the Public Health Laboratory Service was able to isolate the specific organism as Salmonella typhimurium. This was eventually traced to carriers in the house at which the visitor stayed and his own home. The carriers were kept under observation until negative bacteriological findings were received. ICE-CREAM—chemical examination Thirty-six samples were submitted for chemical examination. A summary of analysis is given below:— Samples submitted FAT ANALYSIS Under 2.5% 2.5%-5% 5%-8.5% 8.5%-10% Over 10% 36 - — 9 8 19 Page 29 ICE-CREAM—BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION One hundred and twelve samples of ice-cream were bacteriologically examined. These were also submitted to the Ministry of Health Provisional Methylene Blue Reduction Test. The results of these examinations are set out below:— Bacteriological Examination Satisfactory Unsatisfactory 112 99 13 Methylene Blue Test 112 Grades 1 & II 97 Grades III & IV 15 MILK SUPPLY Thirty-seven premises are registered with the Corporation for the retail sale of pre-packed supplies. In addition 10 milk purveyors occupying premises in other districts are registered to retail milk in Barking. Seventy samples of milk were submitted to the methylene blue reduction test and phosphates examination of which three were unsatisfactory. The unsatisfactory samples occurred during the month of July when the weather was warm. Two samples of sterilised milk satisfied the turbidity test. Fifty-four samples of milk were submitted to biological examination for the presence of tubercle; all were reported free from any infection. DOGS IN FOODSHOPS In accordance with a recommendation from the Ministry of Food, w invited the co-operation of the public and shopkeepers in keeping dogs out of the food-shops in the Borough. MEAT DELIVERY In my last Report I made reference to adverse criticism which had appeared in the local Press on this matter and to the improvements obtains by our intervention. I regret to say that in September complaints were made regarding deliveries of lambs and calf carcases. The matter was taken up with the Meat Transport Organisation Ltd and it transpired that the lambs were part of a consignment from Scotland Page 30 which had been received in a dirty condition for which the organisation disclaimed responsibility. The calf carcases were affected by the humid weather and immediate delivery was necessary. HYGIENE IN CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS The Report of the Catering Trade Working Party was issued early in the year. It states that considerable improvement in conditions of hygiene in catering establishments can be achieved by the adoption of Codes of Practice. Two such codes have been drawn up, the first a "Standard Code" which does not call for any structural change but requires better fitments and personal hygiene. The second, the "Target Code," a long term policy, states what is considered necessary for securing that food served in catering establishments is prepared under the best practical conditions. Registration by the local authority of all catering establishments and the enforcement of a standard code are a recommendation. Both are considered to be most desirable and the introduction of the necessary legislation to bring this about is awaited with interest. It is hoped that all entrants to the food trades generally should be taught the elements of hygiene while still at school so that good habits instinctively acquired will remain throughout life. We have tried to add to the training in the school by additional lectures and practical demonstrations. The real benefit of these efforts is to be found in personnel remaining in the food industry after such instruction. It is our unfortunate experience that for various reasons changes are Sequent. The principal reason for this is the fact that so far the catering industry does not offer a satisfactory career. SAMPLING OF FOOD AND DRUGS During the year 306 samples were submitted to chemical analysis, details of which are set out hereunder. The following 9 samples were reported to be unsatisfactory:— Bread Roll— Contained small blackish foreign bodies sisting of partly charred bread. Cocoa— Contained a small quantity of pepper dispersed throughout the sample. Page 31 3. Ham Sandwich— Contained three small brownish-black foreigr bodies which were found to be seeds. 4. Gluconis (Formal)— Almost completely deficient in Vitamin B.1 Label misleading. 5. Cooked Horseflesh— Contained blackish foreign matter of the nature of soot. 6. Crystallised Pineapple—Preserved with sulphur dioxide to the extent of 650 parts per million. 7. Crystallised Pineapple Preserved with sulphur dioxide to the extent of (Formal)— 650 parts per million. 8. Bread— Contained two foreign bodies consisting of pieces of heavily charred bread. 9. Cocoa— Contained foreign fibres (wool and hemp) unsuitable for human consumption. Appropriate action was taken in these instances including proceedings in the case of the Gluconis (item 4) and the Crystallised Pineapple (item 7). In the former case a fine of 40/- was imposed on each of two summonses for offences against the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations and the Labelling of Food Order, together with 20/- costs, a total of £5. In the latter case the defendants pleaded guilty and were fined 40/- Other items of food of which complaint was made by purchasers were condemned. In the following instances proceedings were instituted, the results being as stated:— 1. Bread containing beetle—The defendant pleaded not guilty, but the case was proved and a fine of £5 imposed with £1 costs. 2. Flour containing mice Defendant company pleaded guilty and was faeces— fined £2 with £2 costs. 3. Sausage, containing metal— Case dismissed. 4. Sausage roll, mouldy— The justices found the case proved and posed a fine of £2 and costs. 5. Jam containing glass— In this case the producers were summoned and pleaded guilty. They were fined £5 with 21/- costs. Page 32 6. Mouldy bread— Two summonses were heard in respect of loaves of bread sold to two customers. The justices imposed a penalty of £10 and 21/costs on each summons. Summonses against the producers were dismissed, the Court holding that the bread had been retained too long by the retailers. The following schedule shows the number and type of food samples submitted for examination.

Unfortunately this delay in the building programme coincided with the temporary cessation by the London County Council of the assistance provided by them in rehousing the married sons and daughters of their Barking tenants. Page 37 The Council endeavoured, together with our neighbours at Dagenham, to secure the re-start of the London County Council lettings, and made a substantial financial offer to the London County Council to bring this about. We are hopeful that this further interference with the housing flow will be overcome and the 10 months' delay which has occurred brought to an end. A small number of applicants have been able to benefit by the increase in the number of private building licences the Council has been able to issue for the erection of houses outside the Borough. The 50 successful applicants were selected from a total of 275 who made application on the basis of:— 1. Where the issue of a licence would make the house available for another Barking applicant; 2. Family need. The Council has been especially concerned at the plight of the families made homeless, as the result of possession orders issued by the Courts. The continued inability of the Essex County Council to offer temporary shelter caused greater hardship. The increasing demand for specially designed accommodation for old people of all grades of income has called for a new effort to provide suitable small labour-saving homes, where with a little friendly supervision they can manage for themselves. The Council have recommended three schemes, one of which for building on the St. Paul's Church site they propose commencing as quickly as possible The year under review saw the completion of the erection of the Longbridge Road Estate of 408 flats. This is the largest of the post-war schemes and has given satisfaction to both the tenants and the Council. Slum Clearance,—The rebuilding of the Romford Street area is Pri> ceeding slowly because of the lack of alternative accommodation for the present tenants. Building upon a few small plots is progressing, but this unfortunate!) represents only 32 lettings when completed. Page 38 The present housing position in the Borough is shown in the following tables:— Table I.—Details of the families in Barking who have been rehoused during the year 1951.

It was known that the families had no alternative accommodation to house their furniture and effects so in order to protect them from inclement weather arrangements were made to store them in the large garage in Barking Park. Subsequently it was found that certain articles of clothing and bedding were in a filthy or moth eaten condition and on the authority of the Corporation these were destroyed. The remainder of the articles are still being stored and the owners appear to have little or no interest in their disposal. Page 39 BOROUGH OF BARKING ANNUAL REPORT (Abridged) OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER on the HEALTH OF THE SCHOOL CHILDREN OF BARKING FOR THE YEAR 1951 C. LEONARD WILLIAMS, b.sc., m.r.c.s., l.r.c.p., d.p.h. Page 41 Public Health Department, Town Hall, Barking, Essex. April, 1953. To the Chairman and Members of the Barking Committee for Education. I beg to submit my Abridged Report for the year ended 31st December, 1951. I am, Your obedient Servant, C. Leonard Williams, Medical Officer. Page 43 MEDICAL INSPECTIONS During the year 9,123 children were medically examined at school, which represents 75 per cent. of the total school population. In addition there were 22,854 special inspections and re-inspections at the various Clinics. The Statistical Return at the end of this report shows the classification of defects found at these examinations and the treatment thereof. NUTRITION Of the 9,123 children medically examined at school 4,820 were found to be of good nutritional standard; 4,266 were fair (that is, of normal nutrition) and only 37 were of poor nutritional standard. MINOR AILMENT CLINICS Minor Ailment Clinics were held daily at Central, Woodward, Porters Avenue and Upney, and the total attendances during the year were 26,826. DENTAL INSPECTION AND TREATMENT During the greater part of the year we had four Dental Officers, and an Oral Hygienist commenced in May. Altogether 7,516 children received dental treatment during the year, and 176 orthodontic appliances were supplied. EAR, NOSE AND THROAT CLINIC Specialist Clinics were held weekly by Mr. F. Courtenay Mason, f.r.c.s., Consulting Ear, Nose and Throat Surgeon. During the year arrangements were made for children who had been on hospital waiting lists for a long time to be re-examined for the purpose of deciding wfk ther operative treatment for the removal of tonsils and adenoids was still necessary. In order to enable Mr. Courtenay Mason to review all these cases Dr. Peter Leeson undertook additional sessions at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic. Altogether there were 1,279 attendances at this Clinic, whilst 211 children received operative treatment for ear, nose and throat conditions. OPHTHALMIC CLINIC Mr. R. Jamieson, Consulting Ophthalmic Specialist, attended at Central and Woodward Clinics, and 352 new cases of defective vision and squint were seen during the year. The Orthoptist (under the supervision of the Ophthalmic Specialist) squint training to 224 children. Page 45 ORTHOPAEDIC CLINIC Mr. Leon Gillis, F.R.C.S., Consulting Orthopaedic Surgeon, held 23 sessions at which 91 children attended. In the Physiotherapy Department 539 children received treatment, and 1,664 ultra-violet light treatments were given. SKIN CLINIC Dr. Deville, Specialist Consultant in Skin Diseases, held weekly sessions in Paget Ward at the Barking Hospital, and saw 347 children. The attendances for treatment totalled 2,943. PAEDIATRIC CLINIC Dr. S. B. Dimson, Children's Specialist Consultant, held fortnightly clinics throughout the year, and 91 new cases were seen by him. SPEECH THERAPY The Speech Therapy Clinic continued to be held in the Paget Ward of Barking Hospital, although owing to the illness of the Speech Therapist it was necessary to close the clinic for two to three months in the early part of the year. The total attendances of 955 were therefore not so high as they would otherwise have been. FOOT CLINICS Three hundred and forty-three new cases were treated at the Foot Clinics during the year, a total of 1,041 treatments being given. UNCLEANLINESS INSPECTIONS Out of a total of 20,366 uncleanliness inspections in schools by Health Visitors and School Nurses 423 pupils were found to be unclean; 21 pupils were cleansed at the clinics. INFECTIOUS DISEASES During 1951 the following cases of infectious diseases among school children were notified:— Scarlet Fever 58 Whooping Cough 108 Measles 652 Poliomyelitis Page 46 IMMUNISATION AGAINST DIPHTHERIA The majority of children are, of course, immunised against Diphtheria before they reach school age, but about 100 school children completed a full course of primary immunisation, and nearly 1000 were given a secondary or re-inforcing injection during the year. At the end of 1951 approximately 75 per cent, of the school population were immunised against Diphtheria. HANDICAPPED PUPILS The following statement shows the number of handicapped pupils who, at the end of the year, were attending Faircross Day Special School:— (a) Physically Handicapped and Open-Air Section 66 (This figure includes 16 from other Authorities—i.e. Dagenham, East Ham and Romford.) (b) Educationally Sub-Normal Section 118 (This figure includes 78 from other Authorities—i.e. Ilford, Dagenham and East Ham.) Other handicapped pupils were accommodated in special residential schools as under:— Educationally sub-normal 1 Delicate 5 Epileptic 2 Blind 1 Partially sighted 1 Partially deaf 1 Nine deaf and partially deaf children from this area attended the Tunmarsh Lane Deaf (Day) School in West Ham. CONVALESCENT TREATMENT During the year 102 school children were sent away for convalescent treatment for periods varying from 4 to 6 weeks. FOLLOWING UP An important part of the work of Health Visitors and School Nurses 15 home visiting, and during the year they made 2,166 such visits.
