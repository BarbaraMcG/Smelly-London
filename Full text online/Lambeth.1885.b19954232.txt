During the year ending 25th March, 1886, there have been 52 new lamps erected, and 31 removed to places of greater utility. The total number of ordinary street lamps lighted by the Vestry at the present time is 3,900; there are also 3 5-burner, 22 3-burner, 1 2-burner lamps, and 9 single-flame lamps (each consuming 10 feet per hour); and the cost of lighting, including new columns, removal of lamps, and sundry expenses, amounted to £ 14,133 9s. 6d. The South Metropolitan Gas Company, from Christmas, 1885, reduced the price of gas from 2s. 8d. to 2s. 6d. per 1,000 feet, and the charge for public lamps from £5 12s. 6d. to £19s. per lamp per annum, less the usual discount of 5 per cent. The Crystal Palace District Gas Company also reduced their charge for public lamps from £319s. 6d. to £317s. 8d. per annum, commencing from Lady-day, 1885. These reductions effect an annual saving to the Parish of about £500.

Thirtieth Annual Report of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Being a Report for the year 1885 on the Vital and Sanitary condition of the Parish of Lambeth. Gentlemen, The wtal statistics of the Parish of Lambeth are calculated upon an estimated population of 270,433. In estimating the population, one of three courses may be adopted. The number of inhabited houses appearing upon the rate books may be taken, and a calculation made upon that basis Secondly—The average annual percentage of increase in the population of Lambeth during the last decade may be applied in estimating the increase of the present decade. The former of these modes is open to objection on account of the variety of property, and consequent disparity in the number of inhabitants. The latter, no account of the inactivity in building in the present compared with the former decade. 2 Thirdly—The annual percentage of increase in London, as a whole, applied by the Registrar General in the statistics of the Metropolis, is the alternative basis, and has much in its favour. Hereinafter in this Report the statistics of Lambeth will be compared with those of the Metropolis, and it is fair that they should be computed on the same fundamental principle. For the sake of accuracy, the deaths of Lambcthians who died outside the Parish, namely, in the hospitals and institutions, both Metropolitan and extra Metropolitan, are included. The deaths of non-parishioners are excluded. The following table shows the estimated population in each registration district, with the number of statute acres, and the average number of persons per acre. Registration Districts. Estimated Population. Area in Acres. Population per Acre.

A lower number than have been registered in any year since 1881, being a decrease upon last year's figures of 374. This represents a birth rate of 33.9 per 1000 of the population. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 32.6 per 1000. In the following table the number of births in 1885 are compared with the number of births in each year for the last ten years:— Yew. No. of Births. Year. No. of Births. 1885 9143 1880 9224 1884 9517 1879 9250 1883 9209 1878 8984 1882 9150 1877 8783 1881 8945 1876 8970 Of the 9143 births, 4670 were males and 4473 females, showing an excess of 197 males. The number of births in the several registration districts in each quarter of the year are shown below. 4 BIRTHS. March. June. September. December.

During 1885, 2275 marriages were celebrated in Lambeth, ft lowing a decrease of 74 upon the previous year. I The marriage rate for Lambeth is thus 16.8 per 1000. The Metropolitan rate for the same period being 16.9 per 1000. Notwithstanding the increase of the population the number marriages have steadily fallen, the number this year being sower than on any previous year during the last ten years the exception of those registered in 1882. the exception of those registered in 1882. This may be meen by the following tabic : — Year. No. of Marriages. 1885 2275 1884 2349 1883 2365 1882 22148 1881 2399 1880 2336 1879 2398 1878 2433 1877 2516 1876 2648 A low marriage rate is not extraordinary to Lambeth, the Registrar General's returns show that the marriage rate for the Metropolis in 1885 is the lowest on record. DEATH RATE. 5186 deaths were registered in Lambeth during this year. These deaths were from the various causes stated in the following tables, of these 2593 were males and 2593 females, the number of deaths occurring in each sex being exactly equal. In estimating the death rate 442 must be deducted, having been imported into institutions situated in Lambeth. 6 but having homes in other parts of the Metropolis. On the other hand the deaths of 220 Lambethians who died in outlying institutions in the Metropolis must be taken into account, and also the deaths of 71 persons who died in extra Metropolitan Asylums; hence the deaths proper to Lambeth are 5035, or 18.6 per 1000; the Metropolitan Rate for the same period being 19.7 per 1000. In London the deaths registered numbered exactly 80,000, and was the lowest rate on record. The highest rate was in 1849, when it stood at 30.1 per 1000. The death rate in the five great groups of districts is as follows:— West Districts 17.7 per 1000 North Districts 18.5 „ South Districts 18.8 „ East Districts 22.1 „ Central Districts 25.5 „ The infant mortality, an important guide to the moral and sanitary condition of a district, compares well with London and the country. In Lambeth the proportion of deaths of infants in the ist year of life to 1000 registered births was 131; against 148 in the Metropolis, 138 in England and Wales, 150 in the 50 large town districts, and 155 in the 28 great towns. In Cardiff the proportion reached 189; in Leicester 193; and in Preston 218. The death rate per 1000, of all ages living, was in children in their first year 4.4, at 60 years and upwards 4.6, and of those who died at any age between one year and sixty years 9.6. 6.2 per cent. of the total deaths were certified by inquests. 2.2 per cent. were returned as uncertified. 13.7 per cent. died in the public Institutions, 7 4760 deaths were certified by registered medical practiTioners; 314 were certified by inquests, and 112 were returned a, is uncertified. Diseases of the respiratory system, not including whooping cough, caused the deaths of 1575 persons, or 31.2 per cent. of the total deaths. This is rather below the Metropolitan rate, which was 31.5 per cent. It must be remembered that these diseases, which cause nearly a third of the total deaths, are not alone due to exposure to cold—cold is often the exciting cause, particularly in unhealthy people—but the great causes which predispose to these complaints are, impure air, deficiency of sunlight, and defective drainage. Those who arc engaged in out-door employment, as a class, are not subject to these complaints. The classes which pre-eminently suffer are those who arc employed in badly ventilated workshops and offices, with air vitiated, heated and deoxygenated from burning gas, and those who live in imperfectly ventilated and over crowded dwellings. The condition of the subsoil has also much to do with the causation of these complaints: it has been frequently shown that after the efficient drainage of a district the death rate from phthisis has fallen 20 to 3opcr cent. The Zymotic deaths numbered 625: they will be treated under their rcspcctivc headings. The deaths from Alcoholism were 19, one of which occurcd to a youth under 20 years of age; 10 between 40 and Co;6 between the ages of 20 and 40; and 2 in persons over 60. The number was 8 in excess ot last year—5 occurred in Brixton, 4 in Kennington (first) and 3 in Norwood. f 8 The following Table shows the mortality, male and female, in the different districts, and a comparison of the deaths in each quarter.

Small Pox, which was epidemic in the spring and summer of 1884, again became epidemic in December of that year, and continued so until the end of July of 1885, a few cases also occured in August, September, October and November, no cases however were reported in December. During 1885, 509 cases were reported, the districts in which the disease was most prevalent, were Vauxhall and Stockwell. The centre of contagion in the one place was doubtless the Small Pox Hospital, in the other a lodging-house in which a case wassecretly treated at home. The disease rapidly invaded a large number of houses in the vicinity, and although the cases were removed to Hospital with despatch, rooms and bedding immediately disinfected, and the school in the immediate neighbourhood closed, the epidemic assumed large proportions. At Stockwell 68 houses were invaded within half a mile of the Hospital, the majority of cases, as in 1884, being within the quarter-mile area. In last year's report I brought forward some facts which militated against the theory of aerial dissemination, pointing out that no cases had occurred in the 40 houses situated upon the west side of Hargwyne Street, although the backs of these houses formed the boundary of the Hospital Grounds, and were not many yards removed from the Hospital Buildings themselves. This year, however, these houses did not enjoy the same immunity; seven of the houses were invaded; also in the portion of the half-mile area separated from the Hospital by the line of rails, in which only three houses were invaded last year, eleven houses became infected. The districts in which the Asylum Board's Hospitals are situated throughout the Metropolis have in every epidemic suffered severely; there has been an exceptional prevalence of Small Pox in their vicinity. 19 4 It has been noted in this Parish and elsewhere, that when cases are under treatment at the Hospital, houses are invaded in the quarter and half mile areas round the Hospital. It is of considerable importance to arrive at a definite conclusion upon the manner in which the contagion of Small Pox is carried from the Hospital to the surrounding houses. Dr. Power, the Inspector of the Local Government Board, after a long and careful examination of the details of several outbreaks in the neighbourhood of Fulham Hospital, arrived at the conclusion that under certain atmospheric conditions particles were conveyed by the air from the sick patients in the Hospital to the healthy in the surrounding district. My own observations have led me to believe that aerial dissemination, although perhaps one of the factors, is not the principal factor in the causation of the incidence of Small Pox in the vicinity of Stockwell Hospital. There has undoubtedly been an exceptional prevalence, but there arc certain facts which oppose themselves to this theory. First.—The immunity enjoyed by the inhabitants of certain houses and districts within the half-mile area. Second.—The immunity enjoyed by infants under the age of three months, and therefore unprotected by vaccination. Third.—The distribution of the houses invaded in relation to their connexion with the Sewer that receives the Hospital drainage. Taking the first argument in opposition to this theory, my report for 1884 referred to the immunity of the inhabitants on the west side of Hargwyne Street, about 300 in number, and of the large district in the half-mile area, divided from the Hospital by the line of rails. Assuming the truth of the theory, it is difficult to explain by what means these two localities escaped an invasion. On the second point, upon a search of the register of births it was found that 427 children were born within the half-mile area in the first six months of 1885: speaking generally these 20 children would each remain three months unprotected by vaccination. From January 1st to July 28th, 293 cases were admitted into the Hospital. No case of Small Pox occurred among these children, with two exceptions, in which the origin of infection was traced ; this is remarkable if we are to suppose that the air was impregnated with the materies morbi. And, thirdly, as to the distribution of the houses invaded. During the two years 116 houses were invaded in the halfmile area, of these 72 were upon the system into which the Hospital empties its sewage. In speaking of this system I exclude that portion of the sewer and its branches which is beyond 500 yards above the junction with the Hospital drain; the system drains about one third of the houses in the half-mile area, thus we find 72 houses invaded which are drained into this system liable to contamination from the Hospital, and only 44 invaded houses in the remaining two-thirds of the half-mile area. I do not wish to infer that the contagion of Small Pox is never conveyed by the air, but I think there is good reason to doubt that the poison is sufficiently intense in the atmosphere about one of our Small Pox Hospitals, to infect, in a direct manner, any person. It is possible that Small Pox particles may fall into open cisterns, or into milk, or other articles of food, and, germinating, become sufficiently powerful to infect; or that particles may be conveyed by sewer gas, and by means of defective drainage, into the houses; for particles from the washings of infected linen, and from the excreta of patients, may, in the warmer atmosphere of the drain, find a congenial and fertile soil for their growth and increase. If these Hospitals are to remain in our midst, it is to be hoped that the managers will find some means of treating their sewage so as to render it innocuous before allowing it to enter the main sewer. 21 VACCINATION. Of the 509 cases of Small Pox, 466 were removed to Hospital, leaving 43 to be treated at home; in these cases isolation was efficiently carried out. 22 paupers were reported to have been removed to the Hospital, the remaining 487 cases belonging to the middle and working classes. The following table shows the number of Small Pox cases removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board during the last nine years, and the proportion of paupers to the whole number admitted:— 1877 26 Paupers 577 Non-Paupers 1878 20 „ 277 „ 1879 1 „ 77 „ 1880 1 „ 80 „ 1881 14 „ 440 „ 1882 24 „ 109 „ 1883 0 „ 39 „ 1884 3 „ 207 „ 1885 22 „ 396 „ Making a total during the nine years of 2313, of which 111 were paupers, or, Non-paupers 95.2 per cent. Paupers 4.8 per cent. The deaths registered from Small Pox in Lambeth numbered 83, of these, 35 were strangers in the Stockwell Hospital; deducting these and adding the deaths of 37 parishioner who died on board the Hospital Ships the total would be 85. In the Metropolis in 1881, 2367 persons died from Small Pox; in 1882, 431 persons died; and in 1883 the number fell to 134; and in 1884 the number rose to 913; and in 1885, 899 persons died. 22 Of the 509 cases which occurred during the year 436 had been vaccinated, 56 cases were unvaccinated, and 17 were returned as doubtful. Vaccinated 85.6 per cent. Unvaccinated 11.1 „ Doubtful 3.3 During the year 85 cases died, or 16.6 per cent. An analysis of the fatal cases showed that there had been 29 deaths in vaccinated persons, 44 deaths in unvaccinated persons, and 12 deaths in persons from whom no statement or information could be obtained regarding vaccination. The percentage of deaths in persons vaccinated, and in persons unvaccinated, would read as follows:— Vaccinated 6.7 per cent. of deaths. Unvaccinatcd 78.5 „ ,, It is interesting to note that although vaccination, in numerous cases, does not prevent the advent of Small Pox, and in a small percentage of cases does not prevent death, its power of modifying the severity of the disease is shown in this epidemic in a marked manner. In persons vaccinated —in many imperfectly, in many fifteen or twenty years ago— only one in fourteen has died; in persons unvaccinated more than three in every four persons attacked have died. 23 SMALL POX.

GEORGE COXHEAD. RICHARD EMBLIN. ROBERT BOTT. 42 Samples of milk have been regularly procured and analyzed during the past year. The number of samples has exceeded that of any other article, because milk is more largely used and more easily adulterated than any other; it is used daily in every house and every tenement in the parish, it is almost the only food of the young, it is the principal food in sickness, and in the diet of persons of all ages it is one of the most nutritious elements. By ordering prosecutions in this article of food your Sanitary Committee have been successful in obtaining a supply of pure milk for the inhabitants of Lambeth. Three years ago 20 per cent. of the samples obtained for examination were adulterated, at the present time only about 5 per cent. show an addition of added water. It has been said that the quality of the milk may depend upon the health of the cow or upon the inferiority of its provender, and that the analyst is unable to detect the difference between poor and watered milk. To a certain extent this is true, but I maintain that the buyer is entitled to have milk which is up to the standard in solids, and that if occasionally your Committee have prosecuted in a case where the milk was poor but not watered, not much harm has been done, for the cowkeeper will have learned that it is prejudicial to his interests to feed his cows badly or to keep sick cows. However, I do not think that a prosecution has been taken out under such circumstances. An allowance is made by your Analyst for the possible dependence of the quality of the milk upon that contingency, and your Committee have not ordered a prosecution unless the excess of water has been over 10 per cent. During the year samples of alcoholic drinks were obtained upon three occasions: April 13.—Gin and rum. Oct. 21.—Gin, Irish whisky and Scotch whisky. Oct. 29.—Gin, rum, Irish and Scotch whisky and brandy 43 Beer was not taken, on account of there being no statutory definition of beer, and in the event of its containing no ingredient which is injurious to health a conviction could not be obtained.
