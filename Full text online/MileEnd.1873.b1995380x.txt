REPORT, The Vestry have once again the honor to present to the ratepayers a report of their proceedings for the year ending the 25th March last, and they do so with much pleasure, as they are convinced that the ratepayers will admit that the greatest possible attention has been paid to their interests. The Vestry cannot forbear to mention the loss which has been sustained by the deaths of Messrs. Patten, Stephenson, and F. Charrington. These gentlemen had for years taken a most active part in all matters affecting the well-being of the Hamlet, and the Vestry feel that the ratepayers have lost most able and disinterested representatives at the various parochial Boards of which they were members. Pursuant to the resolutions mentioned in their last report, the Vestry have proceeded to pave the carriageway of the Mile End Road, and have entered into a contract with Mr. J. J. Griffiths for the purpose. The contractor is executing the work in the most satisfactory manner, and when he has completed it (which he will do shortly) the road will without doubt resume its former position, of being one of the best in London. The paving of the carriage-way of the Commercial Road, by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., has been most 8 ently completed, and the Vestry have to congratulate the parish that in a short time the two roads in the Hamlet, on which there is such an immense traffic, will be paved from kerb to kerb. A portion of the old stone removed from the two roads has been used for paving crossings and channellings in various parts of the Hamlet, and the residuo for paving some of the other streets which were unpaved, but on which there is considerable traffic, such as Union Street, Johnson Street, Globe Road, and White Horse Lane. The Vestry have also caused parts of the footways in the Mile End Road to be re-paved, viz. 1.—From Sidney Street to Harlow Place. 2.—From Harlow Place to Jubilee Street (for an uniform width of 17 feet.) 3.—From Stepney Green to Calverley Street. 4.—From Calverley Street to Crown Place. 5.—From Mile End Place to Grafton Street. 6.—From the Jews' Burial Ground to Globe Bridge. 7.—From Canal Bridge to Burdett Road. It having been found from present experience that asphalte paving answers most satisfactorily for footpaths, it was determined to execute the above work, (except those included under item 6) in that material, and contracts were accordingly entered into with the Val de Travers Asphalte Company to do those under items Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 5, and with the Societe Francaise des Asphaltes for thoso under items 4 & 7. By the use of Asphalte a very considerable saving of expense has been effected, while at the same time it is generally admitted that it makes a most even and comfortable path for pedestrians. 9 The old pavement has been relaid in several of the other streets in the Hamlet, where it will doubtless prove a very considerable benefit. A more detailed account of the above works will be found in the Surveyor's Report hereunto appended, to which the Vestry beg to refer. The Ratepayers will naturally anticipate that the expenses of executing works of such magnitude could not be met out of the ordinary rates, and, as intimated in their last Report, the Vestry applied to the Metropolitan Board of Works for a further loan of £13,000 (making with the previous loan of £12,000, the sum of £25,000.) The Metropolitan Board agreed to make the advance on the security of mortgages of the rates, and at £3 17s. 6d. per cent. interest, payable quarterly, and the principal to be repaid by 20 annual instalments, on the 1st October in each year, the first instalment to be made on the 1st October, 1874. The money has been received by four instalments, at intervals of three months, and as the interest is only charged from the day on which the money is actually received, a considerable sum has been saved in this way. It is not improbable that the expenses of the works may somewhat exceed the amount of the loans, but the Vestry are confident that they will be able to meet all demands without the necessity of making any increase in the rates. Having regard to the expenditure on the roads of the Hamlet, the Vestry have not deemed it advisable to incur any very heavy liabilities relative to the Sewerage Works in the Hamlet, but they have, nevertheless, carried out some of very great utility, such as diverting 10 the Sewer in Gloucester Street and re-constructing the Sewers in Wentworth Road, Edward's Road and William Street. All matters of a sanitary nature have received careful attention, and the Vestry feel that there is a strikingconfirmation of this in the remarkably healthy state of the Hamlet throughout the year. The Vestry beg to refer to the reports of the Medical Officer of Health and Inspector of Nuisances for more detailed accounts of the sanitary measures adopted during the year. At the Licensing Sessions in October last there were 37 applications for Licenses for Slaughter Houses and 42 for Cow Houses. Notices were served in every case for a proper water supply to be provided, and these were generally complied with. In three cases the Clerk was instructed to oppose the granting of the licenses until certain requirements were carried out, and the Magistrates adjourned the hearing to enable the parties to comply with the requirements, and two of them having done so, the licenses were granted, whilst in the other it was refused. The Vestry have been obliged to take proceedings, under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwelling Act, in respect of some premises in Upper York Place, which were in a very bad condition. The owner, having been served with the usual notices, appeared before the Vestry and consented to do the works required, but has, as yet, failed to do so. The matter stands adjourned for the present, in order to give him ample time before taking further 11 ings, but no harm can arise as the premises are at present unoccupied. It is very essential that premises of this class should be looked after, as otherwise they may prove the source from which some dangerous epidemic may originate. Mr. Finch, the Contractor for the Jobbing Sewers Work, who had for some years executed the works at the prices contained in his contract, which had long expired, gave notice that he could not continue to do so after the 25th March, 1874, and the Vestry therefore invited tenders for the work. Several were received, but after most careful consideration of all of them, the Vestry resolved to accept that of Mr. Finch, although it was not the lowest, believing, from the thorough manner in which he had always executed his work, that he would continue to do so, and that the Ratepayers would, in the long run, reap the benefit by having the work done well in the first instance. The Contract for the supply of Horses, Carts, and Drivers for the present year shews reduced rates, whilst that for the removal of Dust is only £6 in excess of that of last year. The Vestry has concluded an arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway Company for the removal of the street sweepings, by which the Vestry are to be at liberty to deposit them at Devonshire Street, and the Company are to dispose of as much as they can for their own benefit, the residue to be carried away by the Company at the Vestry's cost, at the minimum rate of freight. It will be seen at once that this is an advantageous arrangement, as a shoot is provided in the Hamlet, whereby a great saving will be affected for horse hire, 12 and the Vestry will only have to pay for the removal of so much as the Company are unable to dispose of. It is estimated that the annual cost of removal of slop, undor those terms, will be between £150 and £200. The Vestry are sorry to have to report that the precepts of tho Metropolitan Board of Works, and the School Board for London, aro vory considerably in excess of the amounts of those of last year, and may probably cause an increase in the rates, but tho Vestry hope tho Ratepayers will bear this in mind, and not attribute tho extra demands to any augmented expenditure of tho Vestry itself. Tho Ratepayers aro aware that tho boundary of this Hamlet, next to Limehouse, runs in a diagonal lino across tho Commercial Road, which was a source of considerable inconvonience in caso of any works being required to bo done to tho road. To remedy this tho Metropolitan Board have, undor tho powers vested in them, made an order, placing part of tho road in tho Limehouse District under the control of this Vostry, and part of the road in this Hamlet under tho control of the Limehouse Board, so that as tar as regards tho control of tho road, each parish has tho same power, as if tho division between tho two parishes runs at right angles across the road. Applications have boon made to tho Metropolitan Board of Works for orders for re-numbering and renaming several streets and roads in tho Hamlet, but at present tho only orders made are those for re-numbering and abolishing the subsidiary names in White Horse Lane and Rhodeswell Road. 13 It is, however, expected that the orders in several other cases (including those for the Burdett and Commercial Roads) will shortly be received. The Auditor of the accounts of the Metropolitan Board of Works having disallowed certain items, charged for the expenses of constructing seats on the occasion of the Public Thanksgiving for the recovery of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, proceedings were commenced against members of that Board individually, for the recovery of the amounts disallowed. The matter having been brought to the notice of the Vestry, they gave it their most careful consideration, and came to the conclusion that the Metropolitan Board had only acted as befitted a great public body on such occasion, and accordingly condemned the proceedings against the members as absolutely unnecessary, and agreed to indemnify Mr. Newton, the representative of the Vestry at the Metropolitan Board, against any loss therefrom. Pursuant to the resolutions mentioned in their last report, the Vestry apportioned among the owners of property in the several new streets therein mentioned the costs of paving the same, and they have great pleasure in saying that they received the whole of the amounts and had in three cases only to take proceedings to recover them. The Tramways have again proved a source of considerable trouble, but after much delay and correspondence the Company instructed the Contractor of the Vestry to repave, at the same time as he executed the Vestry's work, the whole of that part of the road outside the rails which the Company have to maintain. The work, consequently, now assumes a more uniform appearance, and it is hoped that the effect of the whole work having been done together, will be that the road 14 will not so quickly get out of repair as it used to do formerly. After several years of correspondence between the Churchwardens and the Commissioner of Police, the latter agreed to give up the old Watch House in the Mile End Road, near Stepney Green, and the Churchwardens then applied to the Vestry for authority to sell it. The Vestry however considered that the matter should be first enquired into, and, as advised, came to the conclusion that it should be conveyed to or in trust for the Vestry and not to the Churchwardens. To this the Churchwardens demurred, and it was therefore agreed to submit a joint case for the opinion of Mr. (now Vice-Chancellor Sir) C. Hall, which being in favour of the claim of the Vestry, the property was conveyed by the Receiver of Police to Messrs. T. Moore, F. J. Wood, W. Newton, and C. Moody, in trust for the Vestry, and to be dealt with as they may direct. During the year the Vestry Hall has for the first time been assessed to the property tax, its annual value being put at £200. There have been 21 Vestry meetings, 90 meetings of the Standing Committees, and 12 meetings of Special Committees, which shew that the office of a Vestryman, if properly attended to, requires a considerable amount of time to be devoted to it. The Accounts for the year ending 25th March, 1874, have been duly audited, vouched, and allowed and the abstract thereof, as certified by the Auditor, pursuant to the Statute, is published with this report.

Gentlemen, I. have now the pleasure of laying before you a statement of the various works which have been executed under my supervision during the year ending March, 1874. In this period you have carried out works of greater importance and magnitude than have ever been constructed within the Hamlet in a like period. In my report last year, I drew attention to the fact that it was resolved to pave the whole of the carriageway of the Mile End and Commercial Roads, and expressed a hope that in this report I should be enabled to chronicle the completion of these very important and heavy works. I am happy now to be able to record their entire and satisfactory completion. Never have the Vestry studied better the interests of the inhabitants than they have in raising the money at a very low rate of interest, and paving the two main arteries of the East of London. The increasing traffic upon these principal lines of communication to Essex and the various Docks, 4 made it almost impossible to maintain the portions of roads between the Tramways and the paved breasts with Mc Adam, hence the advisability of doing the work in other than a financial point of view. The saving to the Parish consequent upon these works is not seen in this Report, inasmuch as the Report is only up to March of the present year, but I anticipate a considerable saving in road material for the current year. All the entrances across the footways to gateways in the Hamlet are now paved with pitching, and this cannot fail to be a considerable comfort to the foot passengers. A large number of Streets in the South, West, and North Wards have had the channels therein paved with the old pitching from the Commercial Road, and although it must be some time before the whole can be re-covered with McAdamising material, and so re-form the roads to suit the levels of the new channels, yet as this work is done, a vast improvement will be observed in the formation of such roads, and a more perfect conduit for the surface water ensured. The Tram stones, which were removed from the Commercial Road, have been found of immense use when laid in narrow roads. Portions of these stones have been laid in Bancroft Place, Jubilee Street, Old Church Road, Sidney Street, and Globe Road. The benefit of Tram stones laid in such places is twofold; in the first place it provides a safe and even surface, upon which the wheels of carriages may travel, and in the second place it acts as an addition to the width of the footways, by providing a surface upon which persons may walk with ease and comfort when the space is not occupied by vehicles. 5 The following are the quantities of work executed in the Commercial and Mile End Roads. Commercial Road. The work in this road was executed under contract withMessrs. Mowlen, Freeman & Burt. 60627/9 yds. super. carriageway re-laid and grouted. 1572 yards super. carriageway re-laid and grouted in one stone channel. 3547/9 yards super. carriageway dressed, re-laid, and grouted. 10,5866/9yards super. new 4 by 7 granite pitching with Sin. channels supplied, laid, and grouted. 67½ yds. cube Portland cement concrete. 111 ft. 6 in. new 3 in.

York paving, squared and re-laid. 5,045 ft. 10 in. run curb re-set. 6 Footways. A considerable amount of work has been done in paving footways not previously paved, and in laying Asphalte on footways in the Mile End Road. The quantity of Asphalte laid during the year in the Mile End Road has been 4,0455/9 yards by the Val de Travers Company, and 1,285 yards by the Société Francais de Asphaltes. The cost of the whole has been £1,062 12s. 4d. The old paving taken up from the Mile End Road has been laid in Canal Road, Regents Road, Regents Street, Wentworth Road, Tollit Street, Argyle Road, St. Peter's Road, Bow Common Lane. Watering. During the year the water carts were employed on the roads 96 days, at a cost of £659 l1s. for horses and drivers, and of £307 1s. for 7,348,000 gallons of water, supplied by the East London Waterworks. Lighting. The lighting of this Hamlet is done by the Commercial Gas Company, who light 808 lamps. The cost for the year has been £3,455 0s. l1d.

M. KNIGHT. Vestry of the Hamlet of Mile and old Town REPORT on the PUBLIC HEALTH & SANITARY CONDITION OF Mile End Old Town, foe the YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1874. by MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. London: Printed by T. Penny & Co., 121, Leman Street, Whitechapel, E. 1874. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the 18th Annual Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary condition of the Hamlet for the year 1873-4. I will, as usual, first give the statistics of births and deaths, as they afford the simplest and perhaps the best indication as to the well-being and health of the inhabitants. By table I. it will be seen that the total births, 3,850, were 235 below, and the total deaths, 2,108, were 199 above those of the previous year. The birth rate however was 40 per 1,000 of the population, which is about 4.5 per 1,000 above what appears to be the normal rate for the whole country, and nearly G per 1000 above the rate (34.1) for the Metropolis. With respect to this continuous high birth rate year after year, I will only remark that it is a strong testimony to the salubrity of the Hamlet and prosperity of the inhabitants, and these conditions may therefore be accepted as the primary causes of such exceptionally prolific results. The death rate for the year was 21 per 1,000 population living, compared with 20 the previous year. In calulating these results I have kept to the figures at which I have estimated the population during the whole year, and used in my reports to the Health Committee, viz. 97,000, but I believe the present population of the Hamlet to be nearer 100,000. The death rate for the whole Metropolis, during the same period, was 22.7 per 1000 population. 4 Under the head of the five principal Zymotic or Infectious diseases, there was an increase in the number of deaths in 4, viz., Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diptheria and Fever, and a decrease in one, viz., Small Pox from which there were only 3 deaths during the year against 20 the previous year; during the last 2 quarters there were no deaths from this disease. Under the other 4 heads the mortality was nearly double that of the previous year, when the deaths from these diseases were exceptionally few, but was considerably lower than the average for previous 5 years. The average death rate of large towns still exceeds that of country districts by about 4 or 5 per 1000 population living; this excess makes in the aggregate a formidable addition to loss of human life in largo towns, and indicates a proportionally large amount of sickness with its invariable accompaniments of suffering and pecuniary loss to the persons directly concerned, with ultimate prejudice to the well-being of the community. The causes of this greater urban mortality are proper and urgent questions for the consideration of the Public Health Authorities of towns. I am sure that the simple aggregation of persons under good sanitary conditions would not per se constitute a sufficient ground whereupon to anticipate the creation of disease and shortening of life; we have sufficient evidence of this in the close approximation of the death rates of the most sanitary favoured town districts, to those of rural districts. Although over-crowding is not the only cause of the greater mortality in towns, still there can be no doubt but that the compressed aggregation of human beings within limited areas, caused primarily by the building of the largest possible number of dwellings within the least possible amount of space, followed by a similar packing process of the occupants themselves in the several compartments of 5 such dwellings, is the elementary and most considerable cause of disease and increased town mortality. The evil influences of the same extent of overcrowding in isolated dwellings in rural districts are, to a great extent as regards bodily health, combated or neutralized by surrounding open space, pure air, and light. In large towns external air, even in open spaces, is much vitiated from numerous sources, such as exhalations from human beings and animals, from sewers, dust and refuse, manufactories, &c., all combining to destroy or depreciate the vitalizing properties of the atmosphere, and other causes antagonistic to health of a more voluntary character contribute to the foregoing, such as irregularity of living, intemperance, &c., which are more prevalent than in rural places. Our duty is, as far as possible, to remedy these evils. Reference to the Report of the Sanitary Inspector will show that continual efforts are being made in that direction, in this district. The Annual Report of your Surveyor will show much work done in his department, having valuable influence upon the sanitary condition of the Hamlet. One great source of atmospheric pollution, and to which I have several times referred in my reports, is the present system of sewer ventilation. Sewers must of course be ventilated, and the present best known system must continue till a more approved and efficient plan is discovered; but it is disappointing that such a great sanitary work as the main drainage of the Metropolis should still be deficient in this one great requisite ; the lower stratum or breathable portion of the atmosphere must always contain a quantity of sewer gases, escaping as they do, more or less profusely according to the condition of the weather, from ventilators, gratings and sinks. This condition of the atmosphere of London is especially observable on summer evenings, and before rain, The 6 effect upon the general health, caused by continually breathing such an atmosphere, will be sufficiently obvious, independent of the frequent production of some specific and fatal disease. The discovery ot an effective plan of sewer ventilation, whereby pollution of the atmosphere would be prevented, would be one of the most valuable additions to sanitary science, and meet with the ready approval of the Metropolitan Board.

April 20.—Report re houses in Upper York Place as unlit for human habitation, and recommendation to proceed under Artizans' and Laborers' Dwellings Act. Deaths at Various Ages.—Table IV. Table IV. shows the number of deaths at various periods, from birth upwards. As usual, the deaths during the first year of age are largely in excess, and constitute 29 per cent. of the total mortality, and during the next period, from 1 to 5 years of age, the deaths were 20 per cent. of the total, so that of the total mortality 49 per cent., or very nearly half, occurred to children between birth and the end of the 5th year of age; this would be equal to 27 per cent. of the total births for the past year; after the 5th year there is a considerable diminution, and during the period of youth, from 10 to 20 years of age, the number of deaths was much the lowest; after this period there was a gradual increase during each succeeding decennial period, and it is satisfactory to observe that during the GO years succeeding the 20th year, the 8 greatest number died during the last decade or attained 70 years of age and upwards. A note attached to the table shows numerous examples of extreme old age. I consider about two-thirds of the infantile mortality attributable to neglect, improper feeding, impure air from over-crowding, and general bad management through ignorance and carlessness of parents and nurses, and therefore preventible; the other third is caused by natural and congenital weakness, or uncontrolable disease. The great desideratum is to continue good health into old age, and that health may be preserved and life prolonged by the exercise of those means which reason, education, and experience indicate as correct is unquestionable. That the converse of this is also true is demonstrated by every day observation of the destruction of health, and consequent premature termination of life by our own voluntary acts, in our mode of living. On the other hand, it is not possible, for individuals or their offspring, in the course of one or two generations only—however well they may shape their course of life, however conducive it may be to the maintenance of health and prolongation of life—to advance the tissues and organs of the body to a degree of physiological perfection sufficient to inevitably ensure long and vigorous life—such a result can only be attained by slow degrees, by systematic and subjective means—the primary and most essential element in such a system would be rational selection in marriages, influenced, among other points, by personal and hereditary considerations in regard to physical and mental health. Exceptional old age is almost invariably peculiar to certain families, and the old age attained by most, or many of their members, may be traced in its rise and fall in the different branches, in proportion to their intermixture with less long lived families; so that if it were 9 practicable to adopt the means, the improvement of our species and extension of their lives would be assured to a somewhat unlimited extent. I have been lead into making these observations from a conviction that a majority of the deaths in infants and others in after years, are primarily attributable to ill-assorted unrestricted marriages, engendering and pepetuating suffering, disease and premature death. Reform in this direction would do more than even ordinary sanitary science in the interests of public health and human longevity Deaths in Wards.—Table V. The mortality was highest in the Centre and East Wards, where the rates per 1000 population were 21 respectively, and lowest in the West and South, where the death rates were 19.5 and 18.5 respectively. The West Ward thus shows a considerable improvement over previous years, by diminished mortality. The density of population to each acre in the various Wards, is as follows, according to present estimated population,—North Ward, 129.6 persons per acre—East, 114 persons—West, 198.7 persons—Centre, 177.7 persons— South, 154.8 persons. The number of persons occupying each house in the various Wards, is as follows:—North Ward, 7.25 persons—East, 7.21 West, 7.56—Centre, 7.05—South, 7.08. These figures show a remarkably equal distribution of the population of the Hamlet, throughout the various Wards; of course houses in parts of districts are over-crowded, and others contain a proprtionate less number of persons. Mile End Dwellings and East London. I think this a proper opportunity to correct any wrong impressions which may have arisen by erroneous reports in the press, respecting the action of this Vestry 10 towards the reports and recommendations of their officers. In the early part of this year the Pall Mall Gazette, in commenting upon one of my reports, in which I recommended proceedings to be taken under the "Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act," reflected unjustly upon the Vestry, in implying that " nothing more was ever heard of the reports or their recommendations," thus suggesting the only inference that this Board did not adopt or enforce them; the intention of the remark was no doubt of the best, but I can positively state, in the several instances in which I have advised the adoption of proceedings under the above named Act, to enforce repairs or alterations in dwellings unfit for habitation, this Board has invariably adopted my reports, referred them to their Surveyor, and carried out the provisions of the Act, by enforcing his recommendations. It would be difficult to trace out the origin of the infatuation which seems to pervade the minds of all people who do not know the East of London, that it is the matrix and birth-place of everything typical of penury, disease, and general human discomfort; that it has its share of all these mortal infirmities is true enough, but the delusion that it is afflicted with anything like the disproportionate quantities ascribed to it, should be dispelled by a better acquaintance with the facts. There are as good houses, with as comfortable and happy, even as luxurious interiors, with as well educated and refined occupants, as good roads and streets, as satisfactory sanitary conditions, and as low rates of mortality as in the supposed more favoured districts of London. The following is a comparison of the death rates of three West End Districts, during the past year, with that of our own:— 11 Kensington 21.5 per 1000. St. George's, Hanover Square 22 „ Marylebone 23 „ Mile End Old Town 21 Metropolis 22.7 „ The shocking over-crowding in West End houses during the season, greatly exceeds anything of the kind in the East End, and would be quite as probable a cause of fever as infected milk from the country; the train of other evils resulting from such a state is proverbial. The inhabitants of East London themselves seem to be becoming infected with, and to foster this depreciatory feeling, and as a conseqence lose respect for the locality and for themselves, and are coming to think that any discomforts or annoyances, any offensive innovations or dangerous nuisances, whether injurious to health or prejudicial to the value of property, or disagreeable to neighbours, must be resignedly tolerated because it is East London; and the projectors of such offences consider themselves absolved from penalty or censure because it is only the East End ; all such circumstances, however dissociated they may appear to the uninitiated, in regard to the publie health and well-being, have a considerable aggregate effect upon both. It will be well if both Sanitary Authorities and the Police do not i/ become infected with this "laches". Sanitary Inspector's Report of Works executed during the year 1873—4. Houses and premises connected with new sewers 132 Old drains abolished 120 Houses cleansed and purified 127 Houses disinfected 65 12 Houses visited where contagious diseases had occurred, and notices left re contagious diseases 107 Traps provided to closets and drains 87 Foul and defective drains cleansed and repaired 163 Dust bins provided 41 Cesspools abolished Water supply provided to houses 20 Accumulations of dung and offensive) matter removed 19 Premises from which pigs were re-) moved 13 During the year many inspections have been made of premises where offensive works were carried on, and the necessary orders given for the abatement of the nuisances. In all cases coming to my knowledge, I have removed and properly disinfected (with the consent of the owners) all bedding and clothing used by persons suffering from infectious diseases. In addition to the above, all bakehouses have been visited twice during the year, and, where necessary, notices were served requiring the respective owners to limcwhite and otherwise cleanse the same. The whole of the slaughter and cow houses in the Hamlet have likewise been frequently visited and many improvements effected. Your obedient servant, HENRY LESIIAW, Sanitary Inspector. 13 New Buildings, Dwellings, &o. The following dwelling houses and public buildings have been erected in the Hamlet during the year ending March, 1874. For this return I am indebted to Mr. C. A. Legg, the District Surveyor to the Metropolitan Board:— New Dwelling houses 84 Public Buildings for School Board of London 3 Total .87 previous year. New Dwelling Houses 104 School Board Buildings 2 Sectarian Schools 4 Total 110 Open Spaces. The open spaces in the Hamlet are rapidly disappearing under cover of bricks and mortar; one especially, adjoining the canal in Ben Jonson Fields, would have made an admirable play ground for children, and indeed, it has been for many years used for that purpose, but as the educational authorities entertain views opposite to those hitherto generally believed and accepted, as to the preliminary necessity of a healthy body, for the production of a sound and educated mind, they have replaced the play ground by a large School Board School. As I have before urged, the opportunity afforded in the compulsory erection of these Schools, was admirable for the purpose of obtaining sites for 14 play grounds also, on a sufficiently large scale, if only for the use of children attending such Schools; but so far from this having been done, it is very rare to find even a strip of spare ground around the Schools. In the instance above recorded in this Hamlet, there was ample surplus space for a large play ground, but this will be, I understand, covered with houses. Auy new and comprehensive Building Act for the Metropolis should contain clauses for the enforced provision of play grounds for children, if not for recreation grounds for adults as well. In every populous district grown people can promenade with benefit in wide, well-made roads, but children cannot have their natural and necessary play there. The recently withdrawn Building Bill, of the Metropolitan Board, was not intended as a comprehensive sanitary measure, as it contained no new provisions having such tendency. Peoples' Parks are valuable for health in many ways, but the conventional recreation legislated for, is not of the kind essential to promote the health of children and improve their physical and mental development. To provide for the healthy rearing of children must be one of the elementary principles of public hygiene, and as such ought to obtain immediate practical condsideration; but if these reasons are insufficient, then I would urge it upon those of humanity; with unhealthy homes and no out-door place of resort but the streets, how can we expect children to become vigorous and good. There was only required the latest refinement of philanthropic inhumanity, by which a family may be consigned to the altitude of a top story, in a Peabody or Waterlow dwelling, to complete the despair of ever hoping to see in the Metropolis a poor man's home built consistently with health and comfort. I have heard very many complaints, especially from elderly people, of the suffering inflicted upon them in having to climb so 15 high to their rooms; over exertion of this kind always adds to the suffering and danger of those afflicted with heart or lung disease, and where these affections do not already exist, would be very likely to cause them. This Hamlet does not yet possess an example of these lofty and cheerless abodes. East London Water Supply. The water supplied during the year has been, generally, much superior in quality; this is no doubt owing to improved filtration and means of storage, enabling the Company to get rid of previous impurities. The quantity supplied was about 26 to 30 gallons a day to each person, or 3,000,000 gallons a day to the population of the Hamlet, exclusive of that used for manufacturing and other than domestic purposes. Many complaints were made of the water having been cut off from houses and the occupants deprived of direct water supply for many weeks in succession, owing to non-payment of rates, generally by the default of non-resident landlords. I have so often referred to this dangerous legal power exercised so freely by the Company, that it is unnecessary now to remark further thereon. Gas. The illuminating power of the Gas supplied to the Hamlet, by the Commercial Gas Company, has never been below the standard required by the Act of Parliament. The average illuminating power was 14.15 sperm candles, compared with ordinary 15 hole Argand burner. The legal standard required is 12 candles only. The sulphur-carbon impurities averaged 22 grains per 100 feet of gas, being slightly in excess 16 of the previous year. Ammonia 1.75 grains, the legal standard allowed being 5 grains. There was never at any time any trace of sulphuretted hydrogen. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, MATTHEW CORNER, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. TABLE I.
