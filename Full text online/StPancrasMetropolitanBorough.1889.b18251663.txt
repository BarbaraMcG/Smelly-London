THIRTY-FOURTH ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, BEING THE REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1889. TO THE VESTRY OF ST. PANCRAS. Gentlemen, The labours of your Sanitary Department are increasing apace, and have not been conducive to the early issue of a comprehensive annual report. Some compensation for this is afforded in the fact that both the birth-rate and death-rate are the lowest yet recorded in St. Pancras. As in previous years, all the tables have been corrected by the inclusion of parishioners dying without the parish, and the exclusion of non-parishioners dying within the parish, and the tables referring to the sub-districts farther corrected by the distribution of births and deaths, not referable to any particular sub-district, to the various sub-districts according to population, and as many as the tables as possible have been omitted from the text, and placed in the Appendix at the end of the Report to facilitate reading and reference. Subjects of interest in the Report will be formed under their respective headings:— Insanitary areas and Artizans Dwellings, under Dwellings. The results of the Infectious Disease Notification Act, and the New Disinfecting Chamber, under Disinfection. The interesting brick-burning case, under Nuisances. The first steps towards extension of constant water supply to the area adjoining Primrose Hill, under water supply. As usual, a brief meteorological record precedes the vital statistics. 9 METEOROLOGY OF LONDON, 1889. Periods. Barometer. Temperature. Daily range of Temperature. Degree of Humidity. Rainfall.

PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Inmates.—The Resident Staff of a Public Institution, being more or less permanently resident, forms part of the population of the Sub-District in which it is situated, and the births and deaths among members of the staff form part of the deaths of the Sub-District. The inmates of Public Institutions on the other hand are mainly temporary residents, and the number of inmates, as well as the births and deaths of inmates, require redistribution to their several Sub-Districts. The number of inmates, and the births amongst inmates, are re-distributed to the SubDistricts in proportion to population, but the deaths of inmates according to the Sub-Districts of their previous residence, except those whose previous residence being unknown, are re-distributed in proportion to population.

POPULATION. At an interval of nine years since the taking of the last Census, it becomes proportionately difficult to estimate the population. The natural increase or excess of births over deaths, although far from being reliable in numbers, affords some idea of the proportion to be expected when combined with a comparison of the previous Census returns, and the annual number estimated since. These figures are shown in the two following tables, the total population of the District in the middle of 1889 working out at 245,300. ST. PANCRAS SUB-DISTRICTS.

The number of Marriages celebrated in St. Pancras during 1889 was 2,011, the number during the previous year was 2,139, and the annual average for the past ten years 2,178. BIRTHS. The number of Births registered in St. Pancras during 1889 was 7,298, the number during the previous year was 7,349, and the annual average for the past ten years 7,739. Per 1,000 of population the birth-rate during 1889 was 28.5, the annual average during the preceding decade being 32.2. The birth-rate is the lowest recorded in St. Pancras since 1856. The proportions in the Sub-Districts are given below, the 204 Birth occurring in Public Institutions having been distributed to the Sub-Districts according to population: — Sub-Districts.

During the 52 weeks ending December 28th, 1889, the corrected number of Deaths of St.. Pancras parishioners was 4,454, the number during the previous year having been 4,628, and the annual average during the preceding decade 4,649. The death-rate per 1,000 of population was 18.16 during 1889, 18 95 during 1888, and the annual average during the preceding ten years 20.22. The death rate for London during 1889 was 17.4. The Death-rate is the lowest recorded in St. Pancras since 1856. The following are the Death-rates for the Sub-Districts, 255 Deaths from all causes not referable to any particular Sub-District being distributed according to population. Sub-Districts.

The principal Zymotic Diseases caused 498 deaths, compared with 645 in the previous year, and an annual average for the preceding ten years of 705. The only diseases in which an increase was shown were Diphtheria and Diarrhoea. The Zymotic death-rate was 204 per 1000 of population, that of London being 2.22. SMALL-POX. There were no deaths from Small-pox during the year. MEASLES. The number of deaths from Measles was 86, or 48 below the annual average for the preceding decennium. 12 SCARLATINA. The deaths from this disease were 28 in number, or 53 below the average. TYPHUS. This is the fifth consecutive year that no death has been registered in St. Pancras from this disease. WHOOPING COUGH. 108 deaths were recorded from this disease, 66 below the annual average. DIPHTHERIA. From this disease an increase of 11 deaths upon the annual average occurred during the past year. The numbers being 62 against 51. CONTINUED FEYER. The number of deaths from Continued Fever was two, about the annual average. TYPHOID OR ENTERIC FEVER. Typhoid Fever caused 29 deaths during the year, the annual average for the preceding ten years being 57. DIARRHCEA. Diarrhoea showed a slight increase in the number of deaths attributed to it, 183 against an average of 177. SEPTIC DISEASES. The number of deaths from these diseases in 1887 were 49, in 1888 were 4.3, and in 1889 were 34, viz., 11 from Erysipelas, 17 from Septicæmia, and 6 from Puerperal Fever. TUBERCULAR DISEASES. The number of deaths from Tubercular Diseases which fell in 1888 to 617, rose in 1889 to 682. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. The deaths from Respiratory Diseases which numbered 975 in 1888, fell to 871 in 1889. VIOLENT DEATHS. Violence was the cause of 177 deaths, or 20 more than in 1888, 136 being due to accident or negligence, 8 to homicide, and 38 to suicide. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. The number of uncertified deaths was 5, the same number as in the previous year. INQUESTS. 431 inquests were held in St. Pancras during (he year, about the average usual Dumber. 13 COMPARATIVE MORTALITY OF THE SUB-DISTRICTS. In tables 8, A, B, and C appended to this Report, the comparative statistics of the Sub-Districts will be found fully calculated. The two following tables summarise the leading facts:- istricts. Per 1000 Population. Per 1000 Births. Deaths under 1 year. Birth-rate. Death-rate. Regent's Park 26.4 70.0 137 Tottenham Court 26.5 20.4 184 Gray's Inn Lane 27.5 20.2 173 Somers Town 33.6 20.4 151 Camden Town 31.9 18.9 138 Kentish Town 30.7 16.4 101 St. Pancras 28.5 18.1 145 Sub-Districts.

This order corresponds with the density of population in the respective Sub-Districts. INFLUENZA. At the extreme end of the year 1889 an epidemic of Influenza broke out, but the first deaths from the disease did not occur until the following year. Your Medical Officer of Health furnished a special report upon the epidemic immediately upon its subsidence, this report was printed and circulated. 14 SANITATION. MORTUARIES. The number of bodies deposited in the Public Mortuaries during the year was as follows :— General Mortuary 373 Infectious 4 Total 377 CORONER'S COURT. The number of inquests held during the year in the Coroner's Court, inclusive of Poor Law Cases, was 390, the total number of inquests held in St. Pancras being 431. INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

The following is an account of the Disinfection performed during the year: — A. Number of Rooms Fumigated 391 B. List of Articles Disinfected. Bed 287 Rugs 22 Mattresses 77 Cushions 55 Pillows 580 Carpets 88 Palliasses 102 Covers 16 Sheets 236 Hearthrugs 1 Blankets 361 Curtains 4 Counterpanes 229 Mats 6 Articles of Wearing Apparel 1159 Sacks 5 Bolsters 150 Sundries 47 18 c. Articles Destroyed by Fire with Owners consent. Beds 30 Articles of Wearing Apparel 29 Mattresses 5 Rugs 2 Pillows 13 Carpets 5 Palliasses 11 Curtains 2 Sheets 7 Cushions 6 Blankets 3 Mats 1 Counterpanes 4 Blinds 2 Sundries 2 The Process of Disinfection of a room that has been occupied by a person suffering from infectious disease consists in disinfecting the air, the contents, and the surfaces of the room. In order to carry this out the following instructions are given : — 1. To fumigate the air. 2. To remove the bedding, clothing, and other unwashable articles to a proper chamber for disinfection by steam or other form of heat, and useless articles for destruction by fire. 3. To well boil all washable articles. 4. To thoroughly wash and cleanse the furniture. 5. To strip and cleanse the walls (burning the paper), lime white the ceiling, and scour the wood work, paint work, floor, etc. A printed notice with these instructions is delivered to the owner or occupier by the Disinfector at the same time as he carries out instructions numbered 1 and 2, no charge being made for this, it is rarely that any difficulty is experienced in obtaining compliance with the three succeeding instructions. The diseases enumerated in the Infectious Disease Notification Act has been divided into three classes, a list of which is given below, with the number of the instruction to be followed in each case. DISEASES. Class I. Small-pox . 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-All. Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever Diphtheria or Membranous Croup Class II. Typhoid or Enteric Fever 2 and 3 only. Continued Fever Relapsing Fever Puerperal Fever Cholera Class III. Erysipelas No action exoept by special instruction. The New Disinfecting Chamber.—The dry heat apparatus for disinfecting unwashable articles was displaced towards the end of the summer by a high pres- 19 sure steam chamber, with a hot air blast, made by Messrs. Goddard, Massey, and Warner, of Nottingham. The new chamber came into use at the end of October, concurrently with the commencement of the Infectious Diseases Notification Act. This chamber is rectangular, with the angles rounded, in order to avoid lodgement, and give additional strength. Its internal dimensions are—height 5ft., •width 5ft., length 6ft. 6in. It is entirely surrounded by a double jacket, and the doors are also double jacketed. The space (about 4 inches) between the two jackets is filled in, the lower half by water, and in the upper half and in the doors the steam circulates. The water is heated by a furnace underneath, it takes about an hour to get up steam. A safety valve is situated on the top of the chamber. Steam is admitted into the chamber from the jacket through a screw down valve, and it is withdrawn from the chamber through a screw down valve by a steam exhaust pipe discharging into the chimney. Two dial pressure gauges over the door mark the pressure and temperature in the jacket and in the chamber respectively. A supply of hot air is laid on through a channel furnished with baffles and running at the back and along the side of the furnace, and discharging through a screw down valve into the Chamber. This pipe, at my suggestion, has been furnished with a thermometer to mark the temperature at which the hot air is admitted, and the temperature is regulated by a cold air supply tap which has been also attached. The apparatus is worked in the following manner. Having raised the steam in the jacket to 201bs. pressure, the chamber is charged with the articles to be sterilised, and the doors are clamped. The exhaust valve is opened and also the hot air valve, by this means the cooler air is withdrawn from the chamber and displaced by the current of hot air. This seems to thoroughly dry the articles and to displace the cooler air from their interstices which otherwise might cause condensation of the steam. The hot air valve is now closed and the steam supply valve opened, and then the exhaust valve is closed. In about ten minutes a pressure of 20lbs. and temperature of 260° F. is marked in both chamber and jacket. The steam supply valve is now closed and the exhaust opened until the pressure gauge of the chamber runs down to zero. This intermission only occupies about one minute, and is necessary to insure complete penetration by the steam. The exhaust is now closed and the steam valve again opened; in another ten minutes the two gauges will both be found to mark 20lbs. pressure and a temperature of 260° F., with a temperature of at least 212° F. in the interior of mattresses, pillows, and other bulky articles. This has been repeatedly proved by actual experiments. The steam valve is now closed, and the exhaust valve and the hot air valve are now opened to drive out the steam. This accomplished, the chamber is opened and the articles taken out the opposite end to which they were introduced into a separate room free from infection and infected articles. 20 The advantages of the apparatus beyond the supreme advantage of high pressure steam are two-fold. The square shape permits of full-sized mattresses being laid flat and provides for great capacity. The complete double jacketing, together with the hot blast, entirely prevent any condensation. There is economy of space, of heat, and of steam in having the boiler and the chamber in one complete. The apparatus, roughly, cost £200, inclusive of boiler, but exclusive of fitting and extras. Two hand-trucks are now employed instead of one, the one to bring infected articles and the other to return disinfected articles; the one truck used formerly was disinfected each journey. The substitution of a horse for the two men employed in dragging these trucks, which in the end would prove more economical, has become an urgent necessity since the increased disinfection, following upon the increased number of infectious diseases notified. Vaccination.—The following tables, supplied by Messrs.

The anxiety of public bodies, especially Railway Companies, to seize every availablo open area, is likely to deprive this densely populated District of some of its much needed garden spaces, unless every aggressive movement be closely watched. This is the more necessary on account of the termini of the three great Northern Railway Companies, together with their goods depots being situated in St. Pancras. DWELLINGS. House to House Inspections have been carried on during the year, but on account of the increased work of your Sanitary Department in gradually diminishing proportions. A list of streets inspected together with the number of houses, rooms, and occupants will be found at the end of the Report. Tenement Houses when permitted to lapse into extreme insanitary condition have a prospect of being adequately controled by the Bye-Laws contemplated to be framed by your Vestry. Industrial Dwellings have not made any further extension in the Borough during the past year. A list of the existing dwellings and their accommodation is appended to the end of this Report. Common Lodging Houses were maintained in a fair sanitary condition, a list of these dwellings is also appended. Cellar Dwellings, of which a very large number exist in the southerly portion of the District, are extremely difficult to deal with. The problem of rendering many of these dwellings fit for healthy habitation without unhousing the ocoupants still remains unsolved. Canal Boats used as dwellings when stationed in St. Pancras are rarely found to infringe the regulations on account of the careful registration and supervision. The canal boat population appears to be improving in morals and education, as well as physique. Caravans and Tents used as dwellings find little or no room now in St. Pancras for squatting Insanitary Areas.—In reply to a circular letter addressed to the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis by the London County Council, the following areas were reported as insanitary:— Wait's Place. Passmore Place. Cromer Street, North Terrace, Argyle Place, Riley Street, Dutton Street, Wood Street, Brighton Street, and a portion of Tonbridge Street, also Brunswick Grove. Churchway, Elizabeth Court, and York Buildings. Prospect Terrace, and Derry Street block. North Crescent Mews, and Brantome Place block. 24 This report has effected the demolition of "Waits Place and of Passmore Place, and has directed the attention of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and of the Marquis of Camden, to the improvement of their estates in Camden Town.

Unsuccessful direct application having been made to the West Middlesex Water Works Company to furnish a constant supply of water to the area within the parish, situated between Primrose Hill and the London and North-Western Railway Company's main line, an application was subsequently made to the London County Council for the supply to be furnished. The County Council has required the Company to furnish the supply to the area, and the Company has issued the usual advertisements and served the notices. This is the first occasion on which the Metropolitan Authority, formerly the Metropolitan Board of Works, now the London County Council, has made such a " requirement." When this supply will have been made constant, the only area remaining under intermittent supply of water in St. Pancras will be a narrow strip lying between Albany Street and Regent's Park. il 27 Reference to Table 9 A of the sanitary work accomplished during 1889 will show the amount of work in connection with drainage. The following were the results of testing drains of doubtful condition during the year:— No. Tested. RESULT. Satisfactory. Defective.

SEWERAGE. Increased flushing and ventilation of the sewers at a higher level prove a ready remedv for the complaints made of street ventilators. REFUSE REMOVAL. The mews and stable-yards in the Parish are regularly inspected, and during the warm weather particular attention is directed to the removal of stable refuse, especially where large numbers of horses are kept. During the hay season great difficulty is experienced in obtaining sufficiently frequent removal, but every effort is made to prevent undue accumulation, and as close conformity as possible to the following regulations of your Vestry, which are placarded in every mews:— St. Pancras, London. Regulations for Mews and Stables. Every mews is to be kept well swept, and the dung, or other offensive matter, is to be removed at least every forty-eight hours before eight o'clock in the morning. Dung bins to be thoroughly cleared, the bottoms properly drained and not below the surface of the yard, or the manure to be stored in manure vans. By Section 53 of the Sanitary Act, 1866, it is provided that where notice has been given by the Nuisance Authority or their officer or officers for the periodical removal of manure and other refuse matter from mews, stables, or other premises (whether such notice shall be by public announcement in the locality or otherwise) and subsequent to such notice the person or persons to whom the manure or other refuse matter belongs shall not remove the same, or shall permit a further accumution, and shall not continue such periodical removal at such intervals as the 28 Nuisance Authority or their officer or officers shall direct, he or they shall be liable, without further notice, to a penalty of twenty shillings per day for every day during which such manure or other refuse matter shall be permitted to accumulate, such penalty to be recovered in a summary manner. Any person not conforming to these regulations will be prosecuted as the law directs. By order, Thos. Eccleston Gibb, Vestry Clerk. NUISANCES. During the year 1,927 notices were issued for sanitary amendments, 123 orders were served and 47 prosecutions (exclusive of 41 under the Food and Drugs Acts) were instituted. One case deserves special record. Brick-burning.—St. Pancras Vestry v. Ball. In October, after repeated occurrence of nuisance from brick-burning, the defendant Ball was summoned at the Marylebone Police Court. A clamp 71 ft. long, 30 ft. wide, and 12 ft. high was burning on the plot of land (a spoil bank belonging to the Midland Railway Company) bounded, on the north by the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, on the east by Burghley Road, on the south by Lady Somerset Road, and on the west by the Highgate Road, the nearest houses in the Burghley Road being 268 ft. distant. Evidence was brought to prove the nuisance and injury to health, and also the difficulty of excluding the fumes from sleeping and sitting-rooms, and the greater injuiy to those sleeping in confined rooms charged with the fumes than to those working nearer to them in the open air. The symptoms of ill-health were soreness of the throat and nausea, in some cases vomiting and loss of appetite, especially in the morning. Edward Collins, a retired brickmaker, living at Willesden, gave evidence that he had been obliged to desist from burning stock-bricks in clamps on account of the nuisance in the neighbourhood of houses, and was of opinion that such bricks should not be burned in a residential neighbourhood. Even a Scotch kiln would cause a nuisance, and this class of bricks could not be burned in a Staffordshire kiln or a Hoffman's Patent Kiln, which would reduce any nuisances to a minimum by means of shafts. Mr. Cook, the magistrate, said that the possibility of it being injurious to health was sufficient. He was of opinion that the best means to consume the fumes had not been used, and from the evidence of Mr. Collins that class of brickburning could not be carried on in such close proximity to houses without causing a nuisance. An order of prohibition was made. It is interesting to note that some ten years ago the same defendant was summoned before the same magistrate at the same court for the same offence on almost the same spot, when the application was referred to a higher court, but not proceeded with. 29 SUMMONSES Under the Metropolis Local Management and other Acts.

Infectious Dssease (Notification) Act (52 & 53 Vict. c. 72).—By this Act the head of the family, the nearest relative, the person in charge or the occupier of the building is required to notify to the Medical Officer of Health whenever an inmate of a building is found to be suffering from infectious disease, and the medical attendant to certify the particular infectious disease from which the patient in such building is so suffering. The infectious diseases included in the Act are "small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina or scarlet-fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal," and any further infectious disease which the local authority may by resolution include. Public Health Act (52 & 53 Vict. c. 64).—By this Act the cholera regulations made by the Local Government Board in July, 1883, are confirmed, and it is enacted that the Board •' may provide for such regulations being enforced and executed by the Officers of Customs as well as by other authorities and officers," and "may provide for the detention of vessels and of persons on board vessels and for the duties to be performed by pilots, masters of vessels, and other persons on board vessels. Poor Law Act, 1889, (52 53 Viet. c. 56).—By this Act the Metropolitan Asylums Board is empowered to " admit any person who is not a pauper, and is reasonably believed to be suffering from small-pox, fever, or diphtheria, into an asylum provided by the managers.'' "Diphtheria" is included as one of the diseases that may be admitted by the managers. It also practically constitutes the Board the authority for providing ambulances for infectious diseases in the Metropolis, inasmuch as the managers "may allow their carriages to be used for the conveyance of persons suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder to and from hospitals and places other than asylums provided by the asylums managers, and may make reasonable charge for their use." (See Regulations under the head of Isolation.) Sale of Horseflesh, &c., Regulation Act (52 & 53 Vict. c. 11).—The object of this Act is to prevent the fraud of horseflesh, &c., being sold as food under a false name. It provides that horseflesh shall only be sold in places conspicuously labelled as places where horseflesh is sold. The medical officer of health and inspector of nuisances have power of inspection of the meat. "Horseflesh" also includes the flesh of "asses" and "mules," and whether cooked, uncooked, or mixed with other substances. TABLES. Appended to the Report are the usual Tables and Lists.
