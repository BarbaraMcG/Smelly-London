The length of roach watered during the past season was 52 miles. The charges made for the water supplied for road watering were as follows:—That by the Southwark and Yauxhall Company at the rate of £40 per mile, and the Lambeth Company, £35 per mile. The total water charge for road watering purposes for the season amounted to £947 Cs., as below:— LENGTHS OK ROAD WATERED. COST FOR WATER £ s. d. 17¾ Miles, Water supplied by the South wark and Yauxhall Water Company 670 0 0 6¼ Miles. Water supplied by the Lambeth Water Company (including Standposts, &c.) 245 15 0 28 Miles. Water procured from 20 Wells, sunk in the lower parts ot' the Parish by the Vestry, and also by water procured from the Grand Surrey Canal 31 11 0 52 Miles. £947 6 0 12 ROAD WATERING AND SLOPPING. Your Committee having, for several years past, found that this work had not been carried out to the satisfaction of the Ratepayers, gave the subject much consideration; and, in preparing the Contracts for 1876-7, resolved to recommend the Yestry to make the experiment of executing a portion of this work without the aid of Contractors. For this purpose permission of the Yestry was obtained to purchase Horses, Carts, See., for carrying out the work of Division E—viz., the Peckham Rye and Nunhead District; this course was the more especially recommended as the Contract amounts at the last time for tendering for the several Districts were much in excess of those of previous years. It is, of course, too early to thoroughly anticipate the results of this experiment: nevertheless enough time has elapsed to convince your Committee that one essential at least has been accomplished in the District now under their charge—viz., that the work is being well done, in proof of which during the seven weeks the work has been in their hands not one single complaint has been registered. The Watering and Slopping of the entire Parish by this method is now being seriously entertained by 13 your Committee; they hope, in a short time, to be able to lay before the Vestry such data and results as to the portion now under experiment as will probably lead to the adoption of one whole, undivided, and independent system. The adoption of a system of this kind will require, both on the part of the Committee and the officials, greatly increased attention, and the responsibility of the position is one which will call for the kind consideration of both the Vestry and the Ratepayers. Individual Members of the Committee are now giving a very large amount of personal attention to the duties at present undertaken, which will ba greatly increased should the Vestry undertake the Watering and Slopping of the whole Parish; and although a very considerable amount of work has been done, much effort will yet be required to inaugurate a comple e system. In the interim, the Committee trust the Vestry will support them in the attempt they have made to bring about an alteration from the contracting system, which had proved totally unable to cope with the requirements of this large Parish. 14 I M P R O V E IY1 E N T S . Widening Streets at HIGH STREET, CAMBERWELL, (From Griffiths', Confectioner, to tho " Red Cap" Public Houso at Camber well Green.) CHURCH STREET, (From Camberwell Green to Vicarage Road). HIGH STREET, PECKHAM, (From nearly opposite the "Adam and Eve" Public House to opposite Kye Lane.) HIGH STREET, PECKHAM, (From Plue Anchor Yard to the Police Station at Meeting-House Lane.) In respect to the above Improvements, no further steps have been taken by the Metropolitan Board of Works to carry out the same. It has been considered desirable to again urge these matters upon the attention of the Board, and steps are being taken to bring most prominently before the Board the absolute necessity of anticipating this work in the Loans now being effected for like purposes in other Districts. DOG KENNEL HILL. By an alteration in the steep gradient of a portion of this road, a great easement to the traffic has been accomplished. 15 GROVE VALE, near GOOSE GREEN. The New Building operations now going on in this locality have offered opportunity for Improvement in widening the road. The necessary ground for carrying out the same has been given by the Trustees of the Selwyn Estate and the Leaseholder Mr. E. J. Bailey. Also on the S.W. side of the road, at the sudden curve in the road, the Selwvn Estate Trustees ' * have made a similar concession, subject to an arrangement with their Lessee, Mr. Jacobs, which your Committee has now under consideration. FOREST HILL ROAD. From near Wood Lane, up to the Parish Boundary at the Honor Oak. A similar improvement is here contemplated which will be carried out during the ensuing summer season. RED POST HILL, DULWICH. The fence of Mr. Bristow's (late Attwood's), premises having been set back, at the narrow and curved portion of the road, the Vestry has accepted the ground so given up, which will be added to the width of the road. 16 STREET NOMENCLATURE. Tiif- following Streets hating been ordered to be renamed and re-numbered, by direction of the metropolitan Board of Works, the same nas been carried out by the Officers of the Vestry:— Names of streets.

HOUSE DRAINAGE. The following showrs the number of Houses which have been drained into the Public Sewers under the supervision of the Vestry during the past year:— Houses permanently drained 1,099 Do. temporarily drained 4 Total Number of Houses drained 1,103 24 DUST REMOVAL. The removal of the Dust under the usual system of contracting by a lump sum having, for several years past, caused much inconvenience and dissatisfaction, and the sum which was demanded by tender for the year 1876-7 being so much in excess of that of previous years, your Committee resolved after much consideration to recommend the Vestry to take this work into their own hands, allowing the current contract to continue for six weeks in order to give time for the purchase of the necessary plant, &c. This recommendation having been adopted by the Yestry, stabling for twelve Horses has been erected at the Vestry's Depot, Park Road Wharf; twelve Horses, Harness, Dust Carts, and other necessary appliances have been purchased, and at the time of compiling this Report, your Committee have the work well in hand; and, although at first (from the great accumulation of Dust in the Parish, the default of the former system), which had at once to be removed, the new system may not appear to be so complete as could be desired, nevertheless your Committee have full confidence in the ultimate success of the experiment and that it will prove satisfactory to the Ratepayers at large. 25 DILAPIDATED AND UNHEALTHY DWELLINGS. During the past year proceedings have been taken under the Act, known as Torrens' Act, "to provide better dwellings for Artizans and Labourers, 1868," at the undermentioned places:— Park Buildings, Lower Park Road, Peckham, Belgrave Terrace, Peckham Park Road, James Street, Nunhead, Garsdale Road, Peckham, Goldsmith Road, Peckham, Neate Street, Havil Street, Basing Road, and Edmund Street. In regard to the aforesaid unhealthy and dilapidated dwellings, it was found to be absolutely necessary, in the interest of the health of these localities, to enforce the provisions of the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868, as above quoted, therefore (notwithstanding many protests from the owners), your Committee proceeded to take the necessary steps to remedy the evils complained of, and they now report that the Vestry orders have been complied with, and thesebuildings have, respectively, been either repaired, taken down, or closed to habitation. 26 Your Committee has therefore to report that a large amount of sanitary good has been effected by these proceedings.

MEDICAL OFFICER'S REPORT. 29 MEDICAL OFFICER'S ANNUAL REPORT by J. S. BRISTOWE, M.D. Lond., Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians; Physician to, and Lecturer on Medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital; Examiner in Medicine at the College. of Surgeons. Gentlemen, Owing to circumstances which it is now too late to obviate, my general statistics of births, and deaths for the year 1875 comprise those of 53. instead of 52 weeks, having been made to include the returns for the week ending Saturday, January 2nd, 1875, which were also incorporated in my last year's annual report. The matter is one of no serious, importance; for every few years the inclusion of the statistics of 53 weeks in the year becomes necessary; and allowance has, of course, then to be made in instituting statistical comparisons between those and other years. It will be necessary for me to take the 30 same course on the present occasion; and for this reason I point out at once that the fourth quarter of the year, in my general tables, is made to include 14 instead of 13 weeks, and I further draw attention to the fact that in calculating the birth rate and death rate of the year, I shall deduct the returns for the supernumerary week. The full returns are given in Tables I. and II. which are appended to this report. Certain items of the returns amended for the purposes of comparison are given as follows:— Returns of Births and Deaths for the Fifty-two Weeks ending January 1st, 1876. Births. Deaths. Including Deaths in Institutions. Dulwich 81 52 0 Camberwell 1,267 999 353 Peckham 1,967 1,108 5 St. George's 1,495 863 0 Camberwell Parish 4,810 3,022 358 As usually happens with respect to our own rapidly growing parish, both births and deaths shew an increase upon those of the previous year. Thus, 4810 births were registered in 1875 against 4575 in CAMBERWELL. - Returns of Births and Deaths for the Fifty-Three Weeks ending Saturday, January 1st, 1876.

The Deaths returned for the Sub-District of Camberwell include 357 occuring in the Workhouse and Lunatic Asylum, and those for Peckham 5 occuring in the Workhouse. 31 1874; and 3022 deaths in the former year against 2496 in the latter year. The births therefore shew an increase of 235, the deaths an increase of 526. With one exception the increase prevailed throughout all the sub-districts of the parish. Thus, as compared with those of 1874, in Dulwich the births were less by 9, but the deaths were more numerous by 9 ; and in Camberwell sub-district the births were more numerous by 81, the deaths by 134; in Peckham the births were more numerous by 76, the deaths by 223; and in St. George's the births were more numerous by 87, the deaths by 160. It is obvious however from these facts that while births and deaths have both increased, the deaths have increased in much larger proportion than the births; and that we have here an indication of relative unhealthiness which it is necessary to investigate. In reference to this point it becomes important for us to determine, so far as the facts at our disposal permit us, the death rates of the parish and of its several sub-districts during the year. The death rate, or the per-centage mortality, is the numerical relation between the number of persons who were alive during the year, and the number of deaths which occurred among them during that period. Of these two factors of the death rate, one, namely the number of deaths, is accurately recorded in my tables; the other, 32 namely, the number of persons living during the year; can only be approximately determined by calculations When the census was taken in 1871, it was. ascertained that there were living in Dulwich 4041 persons, in Camberwell 31254, in Peckham 42160 and in St. George's 33851, and consequently in the whole parish 111306. By comparing these numbers, with those obtained in the census of 1861 it appears that during the ten years between 1861 and 1871; the annual increase of the population per cent. was in Dulwich about 8.9, in Camberwell about 3.9, in Peckham about 4.0, in St. George's about 5.2, and in the parish in the whole about 4.5; and, assuming; that the increase of the population has been continued since 1871 at the same rate that prevailed previous to that date, it would follow that in the middle of 1875 the population of Dulwich was about 5807; that of Camberwell about 36786; that of Peckham about 49935; that of St. George's about 42047; and that, of the whole parish about 134504. But before we can fairly calculate the death rate; of the several sub-districts, it is necessary to make some re-distribution of certain of the deaths registered in at least two of them. In the Camberwell sub-district are contained the Workhouse, and twoLunatic Asylums, in which no less than 353 deaths 33 occurred, and in the Peckham sub-district is situated Nazareth House, in which 5 deaths occurred. Now these deaths happen, by a kind of accident only, in the districts in which they are registered; and in comparing the health of the several districts should either be omitted from consideration or be distributed among them in some sort of proportion to their respective mortalities, apart from that due to these institutions. The latter plan is on all grounds to be preferred; and the following scheme exhibits the details of the re-distribution which I have thought it right to make. Registered Total Mortality. Deaths in Institutions to be deducted. Deaths in Institutions distributed, and to be added. Resultant Mortality. Dulwich 52 0 +7 59 Camberwell 999 -353 +87 733 Peckham 1,108 -5 +148 1,251 St. George's 863 0 +116 979 Total 3,022 3,022 From calculations based upon the above data the death rate of Dulwich appears to have been 1016 per cent.; that of Camberwell 1.992; that of Peckham 2.505; that of St. George's 2.318; and that of the entire parish 2.246. 34 In the following table I have collected together the estimated population and deaths, and the death rates as above given; and have added the births, together with the birth rates calculated on the same principle as the death rates. Population in 1875. Deaths in 1875. Death Rate. Births in 1875. Birth Rate. Dulwich 5,807 59 1.016 81 1.394 Camberwell 56,786 733 1.992 1,267 3.444 Peckham 49,935 1,251 2.505 1,957 3.939 St. George's 42,047 979 2.328 1,495 3.555 The Parish 134,504 3,022 2.246 4,810 3.572 It will be seen from this Table that while in Dulwich 10 persons died out of every 1000, nearly 14 were added by births; that while in Camberwell nearly 20 per 1000 died, 34 per 1000 were born ; that while in Peckham 25 per 1000 died, 39 per 1000 were born; that while in St. George's 23 per 1000 died, 35 per 1000 were born; and that for the parish as a whole 22 persons out of every 1000 died, while nearly 36 births occurred among the same number. If now we compare the death rates of the parish and of its sub-districts with those of the year 1874, we shall find (as might have been surmised from the 35 relatively large increase of deaths as compared with that of births) that they have materially increased. The death rate per cent. for Camberwell parish in 1874 was 1.94, in 1875 2.24; for Dulwich the rates for the respective years were .9, and 1.01; for Camberwell sub-district 1.86 and 1.99; for Peckham 2.07 and 2.5; and for St. George's 1.99 and 2.32. The increase for Dulwich is obviously trivial; and that for the sub-district of Camberwell is inconsiderable: but in Peckham and St. George's the advance is large and materially affects the general death-rate of the parish. It may be observed that the Registrar-General in his Annual Summary for 1875. gives the death rate of London for that year at 2.37 per cent. which is higher than the death rate for 1874 by .12; that he gives the death rate of the several groups of districts into which London is for registration purposes divided, as follows: 2.21 for the Western districts, 2.23 for the Northern districts, 2.40 for the South districts, 2.55 for the East districts, and 2.60 for the Central districts, and shews that these also are all higher than the corresponding rates of the previous year ; and that he attributes this general rise of the mortuary rate throughout the metropolis in 1875, mainly to the excessive mortality due to the prevalence of Hooping Cough and Scarlct Fever. These affections, but more 36 particularly Scarlet Fever were very fatal in South London; and they were very fatal in our own parish but mainly in the sub-districts of Peckham and St. George's. Thus there were 125 deaths from Hooping Cough against 76 in the previous year, and 177 from Scarlet Fever against 24; and of these, 52 from ing Cough and 81 from Scarlet Fever occurred in Peckham, and 43 from Hooping Cough and 75 from Scarlet Fever in St. George's. There can be no doubt that the mortality from these affections really did materially influence the death rates of Peckham and St. George's, and in a less degree that of the whole Parish. In order, however, more distinctly to shew the influence of the zymotic diseases Hooping Cough, Measles, Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Fever and Small Pox, upon the death rate, I may point out that the deaths from these affections were more numerous in 1875 than they were in 1874, in Peckham, by 93, and in St. George's, by 95; and that if the mortality of these districts be diminished by these respective numbers the death rate of Peckham sinks from 2.5. to 2.3 and that of St. George's from 2.3 to 2.1. It must of course be admitted that this is not the complete solution of the problem offered by the relatively low mortality of Dulwich and the relatively high mortality of Peckham and St. George's. 37 Differences of social position, differences in the birth rate, largely influence the result: nor must it be forgotten that circumstances may have rendered our estimates of the populations of the several sub-districts inaccurate: and indeed there are reasons to suspect that the population of Peckham may have been under-estimated, in which event of course the calculated death rate of the district is larger than properly belongs to it. From the comparative smallness of the population of Dulwich such errors are peculiarly apt to arise in reference to the vital statistics of that district. The deaths from the above-named zymotic diseases and from diarrhoea are given in the annexed table:— Hooping Cough. Measles. Diphtheria. Scarlet Fever. Fever. Diarrhœa.

The details of the Sanitary work done during the 12 months ending March 26th, 1876, are given in detail in Table III. A large amount of work has been accomplished; but there is nothing calling for special comment, excepting the proceedings taken under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868. The following are the places which have been brought under the operation of the Act and the results in each case:— Neate Street, 120, 122, and 124, ordered to be demolished. Foster's Buildings, Neate Street, 1 to 6 inclusive, ordered to be thoroughly repaired. Havil Street, 14, ordered to be demolished. Basing Road, 10 to 17 inclusive, ordered to be thoroughly repaired. Park Buildings, 12 to 17 inclusive, ordered to be thoroughly repaired. Park Buildings, 3 to 11, and 18 to 23 inclusive, ordered to be demolished.

Sadler, Auditors of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell. 115 THE REPORT OF THE AUDITORS to the vestry, In Respect of the Accounts for the Year ending March 25th, 1876. We have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the very satisfactory condition of the Rate Books, and Vestry Accounts for the year ending March 25th, 1876, and to the excellent and able manner in which they have been kept. Our best thanks are due to Mr. Berry, the Accountant, and Mr. Blanch, the Assistant Overseer, for much valuable assistance rendered to us during the audit. Our examination of the several Books and Accounts in the month of February, has enabled us to get the Audit completed at a much earlier date, than has been the custom in former years, and has quite justified the recommendation of the Auditors of 1875, as the Report may now be published in the month of June, as required by the Act of Parliament The arrears upon balancing the books, are £357 14s. O¼d., against £628 12s. 2¼d., at the corresponding period of last year. Robert Vincent, William Peverley, D. C. Preston, Chas. Jas. Sadler, Auditors of the Parish of St. Giles, Camberwell.

Turney Vestry of St. Gils, Camberwell. REPORT of PROFESSOR ALBERT J. BERNAYS, Analyst under the Foods Adulteration Act, 1872. Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell. Annual Report received from Dr. Bernays, as Public Analyst, under the "adulteration of foods" act, for the year ending Lady Day, 1876. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital Medical and Surgical College, Midsummer, 1875. To the Vestry of St. Giles, Camberwell, Gentlemen, I have again to present a Report exhibiting some favourable features. Milk has, as is usual, supplied the chief number of analyses. Of twenty-six samples, four have been adulterated with water, or say rather more than 15 per cent. Besides these, several have been slightly adulterated, but only sufficiently to require further samples to be taken at a more convenient season. 172 I take this opportunity of repeating that the Society of Public Analysts has fixed upon a standard for milk, which allows of the use of over four per cent. of water. As water must be largely used in the processes of cleansing, it is quite possible that a small quantity might remain in the different utensils, but I also think it will be generally admitted that four per cent. of water is a full allowance for all such operations. One of the Magistrates, before whom only one of our cases has ever been brought, and who convicted in that particular case (No. 20), has since publicly declared, "that he will not consider milk to be adulterated, if it only contain 10 per cent. of water." Now, taking our present standard, 10 percent. really means 14 per cent.! The Magistrate, whose statement I quote, mentions the opinion of Dr. Voclcker as his justification. But I think I may say, without fear of contradiction, that Mr. Wanklyn's experience, and that of so many Analysts ought to be considered to the full as valuable. Mr. Wanklyn's work on milk "is the accepted authority at the present time," and really leaves nothing to be desired. And I may further say for myself that I have lost no opportunity of informing myself on this point 173 from the time I have acted as your Analyst. I have had genuine samples of milk forwarded to me from time to time, so that I might acquaint myself with the changes the milks underwent from month to month, and have found the standard we adopted to be a perfectly legitimate one. Even from my Camberwell experience, I can safely say, that many an honest vendor could have added 10 per cent. of water, and it would have fairly passed muster, and I am well assured that the system has been practised by those who are not equally upright. One of the fairest modes of judgment of milks, is by the standards generally furnished by the Inspectors, drawn from the samples brought at the same time. Let us take Nos. 18 and 20 brought on the same day; the former with 9.42 per cent. of solids, not fat, and 0.72 of ash; the latter with 7.58 per cent. of solids, not fat, and 0.58 per cent. of ash. The diminution in the ash corresponds with the amount of water added. Again, tested by the experience of the past and the present, how is it, I may be allowed to ask, that the quality of milk in Camberwell has so greatly improved, that there is not now one-third of the amount of adulteration in milk that was the case only two years since? No system of fines could have brought about so great a change ! When it is said 174 that the addition of 10 per cent. of water is too small to be worth a man's while to run the risk of detection. I should have thought that 10 per cent. on one's outlay twice a day, besides the additional profit on the sale of milk, would have been a very handsome recompense. Four per cent. per annum is not considered a bad investment of one's money, how much more then 20 per cent. per diem, obtained by the use of water alone ! I have also examined eleven specimens of Butter. These have presented considerable difficulties to the analyst, on account of the skill with which the admixture of other fats is accomplished. By judicious admixture of liquid or nearly liquid fats, the melting-points of the solid fats have been lowered, so as to approximate them to the melting-point of genuine butter; consequently, the melting-point has become of mere nominal value. Instead of adulterating by the admixture of water as was common six months ago,the so-called "butters contain less water than is necessary to make them palatable. The miscroscope has nearly ceased to be of use, as the presence of crystal is no proof of more than manipulation on the part of the manufacturer. Curd has to a great extent disappeared, because some of the "butters" have never been made from milk. 175 The experience I have given does not generally apply to Camberwell butters. It is in the poorer districts of London that I have acquired my information. No. 40, however, was a "butter" only by courtesy, and the Vendor informed the Magistrate that he had bought it as Dutch butter. The absence of curd, the presence of so little water, the smell, and the amount of fatty acid obtainable from the dry and purified fat, viz., 94 per cent., were altogether proofs of the almost absence of the genuine article. I confess, if I only find a very small per centage of an extraneous fat, I do not give a certificate to the Inspectors. Sometimes butter may contain a patch of lard, evidently admixed from the scale-pan of this I take no account, unless I observe them in different portions of the butter, or worked in. It was on account of my experience in another district that I asked our Inspectors to bring me some specimens of Jam. Of jams I have analysed eight samples, and one Marmalade. The latter was very good. Several of the jams—especially Nos. 17, 37, and 38—were very carelessly manufactured , they were dirty, and made of very indifferent fruit. No. 14 was a little injured in color by iron, and No. 22 contained a considerable portion of boiled paper with red lead letters. Only No. 24 176 was very good. But in none of these jams did I find any copper. A sample of Treacle examined by me was thin, but pure. As the Coffee was sold as a mixture, I can only say that it ought to have been labelled chicory with coffee, instead of the reverse. From my experience derived as your Analyst, I have no hesitation in saying that adulteration has decreased since my appointment, but very much remains yet to be done. The analysis of alcoholic drinks has been scarcely begun; the abstraction of cream has not been dealt with under the present Act, and the examination of milk, bread, butter, and such like, will always need a continuance. What the new Act will do for us remains yet to be seen, but the justification of my words in respect to it as it first came forth is complete, seeing that scarcely three lines of the original bill have been allowed to stand. Even now the Act may yet make shipwreck, with reference to the retention, or otherwise, of the word "knowingly." 177 Michaelmas, 1875. I have but a very brief report to make of the work done for the Parish, as I have only had eleven articles submitted to me for analysis. Of the Butters, eight in number, I have no good report to make. Two of them, or 25 per cent. have been found greatly adulterated with fat, other than butter-fat. No. 52 had a melting point as high as 37° C, and was full of crystalline patches; the colouring matter was most unevenly distributed, and the so-called "butter" was rather dirty than otherwise. There was no difficulty in obtaining a conviction in this case, as well as in that of No. 53. No. 53 was, however, far superior when regarded as a mere fat. No. 50 of the same batch was slightly adulterated but not sufficiently to call for notice. 55, 56, and 58, were more than doubtful, and I have recommended that further samples be taken at the convenience of your Inspectors. Out of eight samples, six, or say 75 per cent., were more or less adulterated. The Milks were three in number. One of these, No. 57, was excellent; a second, No. 54, was 178 a very good skim milk, and the third, No. 59, was adulterated, and a conviction obtained at the Lambeth Police Court. In conclusion I may be permitted to observe, that my Report would not indicate that there is no necessity for an Adulteration Act. Christmas, 1875. Since my last Report, the new Adulteration Act has come into force, and every kind of food and drink is now within the province of Public Analysts. It will no longer be said that milks alone engage the attention of Chemists appointed under the Act, as this, my first Report, will prove. Alcoholic drinks will, amongst other things, meet with the attention they deserve. In the last Quarter, I have had twenty-five articles submitted to me for analysis; but, as I have only finished twenty-one of these, it will be as well to say that I have analyzed twenty-one samples. The Milks, six in number, have passed the ordeal of analytical examination, but not without the 179 usual indications of the absolute necessity of constantly keeping them up to the mark. The difference between milks may be judged by the following comparisons. No, 15 was taken by Mr. Fraser, and No. 16 by Mr. Mackay:— No. 15 No. 16 Sp. Gr. 10.35 10.33 Cream 4½ per cent. 14 per cent. Total solids 10.99 13.17 Water 89.01 86.83 Fat 2.43 3.70 *Solids not fat 8.56 9.47 100.00 100.00 *Ash 0.65 0.75 Salt in ash 0.12 0.16 Of Wines, I have at present examined three samples; two Sherries and one Port. The Sherries were marked 9 and 1 3. No. 9 is plastered; No. 13 is not. The plastered wine is known by the presence of a considerable quantity of sulphate of potassium which has not been introduced as such into the wine but in the form at first of calcium sulphate, or plaster of Paris. The tartaric acid of the wine, present in the form of potassium bi-tartrate, or cream of tartar, unites with the calcium of the plaster, and forms an insoluble calcium tartrate; the potassium remaining in the wine as potassium 180 sulphate. In this way, wines which would otherwise be unfit for the English market on account of their acidity, are rendered fairly palatable. Is "plastering "adulteration? If a man desire a genuine wine, yes; but if wine be deemed a manufactured article, no. Although I shall always make mention of the presence of potassium sulphate, I shall not consider it an adulteration unless it be distinctly stated that nothing has been added but what is found in the juice of the grape. Both of these wines are strongly fortified; too much so for health. They contain respectively 38. and 39. per cent.of proofspirit. For the sake of those who are not acquainted with the term proof-spirit, I may mention that it is defined by an Act of Parliament to be "such as shall at the temperature of 51 degs. weigh exactly twelvethirteenth parts of an equal measure of distillec water." It consists of alcohol of 49.4 by weight, and of water 50.6, and indicates alcohol of Sp. Gr. 0.9 at 60 degs. The term derives its origin from the rude method of proof formerly in use, in which gunpowder was moistened with the spirit to be tried, and th alcohol inflamed; if it fired the powder, it was said to be over proof, but if the spirit burnt off and le the powder damp, it was considered to be under proo 181 The weakest spirit capable of thus firing powder, had a specific gravity of about 0.92. Every additional one-half per cent. of absolute acohol above 0.92, is said to be one degree above proof. The sample of Port, No, 7 was also strongly fortified; it contained 39 per cent. of proof-spirit. Although the spirit in most cases was of good quality yet is the quanity undoubtedly large, and the public should be upon its guard in the use of such wines. When we compare Port and Sherry with their 39 per cent. of proof-spirit, and 10 Gin, with only 57.36 per cent. of proof spirit, it will be understood that the socalled "dram" is only one-half again as strong as the wine ! Many a man would hesitate to drink a wineglass full of gin, who would think but little of three or four glasses of such Port or Sherry. Many of the home-made wines, which are considered harmless, would not be given to children if it were known how strong they are as regards spirit. And, for this reason, I would venture to recommend that certain of them should also be submitted to me for analysis. By desire of your Vestry, I have examined four samples of Gin, and two Whiskies. In relation to proof-spirit they rank thus:— 182 Per cent. No. 10 57.36 No. 2 60.60 No. 6 64.20 No. 17 69.77 No. 14 81.30 No. 5 87.70 No. 14 is a Scotch, No. 5 an Irish Whisky. The Scotch Whisky was very smoky, and turbid from the presence of iron, as ferric hydrate or rust. The spirit in both was of good quality. No. 5 was very good Irish Whisky. No. 10 Gin was very weak, and not very clean. It was more like sweetened spirit than gin, and remarkably free from amylic alcohol. The presence or absence of sugar makes a great difference in the apparent strengh of wines and spirits. Many a person is thus deceived, whether intentionally or not. For the sake of information, I give the following; faats:— No. 5 Irish Whisky No. 14 Scotch Whisky No. 17 Gin No. 2 Gin No. 6 Gin No. 10 Gin No. 9 Sherry No. 13 Sherry No. 7 Port Sugar percent. Mere trace Do. do. Do. do. 1.94 2.27 2.50 2.88 3.40 6.50 183 Here we have a further illustration of the caution required in drinking a wine like No. 7, in which the grape sugar disguises the real amount of proof-spirit. How easy to be overtaken by too much wine, owing to a want of knowledge as to its properties ! But, to return to the spirits. No. 17 gin is of admirable quality, and so also is No. 6. No. 2 is good, but rather weak as to proof-spirit. The good account which I have given of spirits' but which in my opinion should only be taken as a necessity or as a rare treat, I have also to give of Porter. I have analyzed six samples of Porter, and these I have found to be sufficiently strong in proofspirit, to account easily for the injury to the health of so many who indulge in this so-called harmless beverage. Proof-spirit Per cent. No. 12 Porter 9.36 No. 1 „ 10.13 No. 11 „ 10.42 No. 4 „ 10.81 No. 8 „ 10.84 No. 3 „ 12.02 In the face of such facts as these, and the amount of malt liquors consumed, we need not wonder 184 that there is so much of drunkenness to lament. One-half pint of any such porter, even of the weakest contains an ample supply of alcohol for any one meal for any person who considers his health. With only two of these six porters have I found any difficulty; in none could I discover anything harmful beyond the alcohol and immoderate sweetness. Very little bitter of any kind is employed. As to salt, the quantity is exceedingly small, and indeed the porters are made with comparatively soft waters. In conclusion, I may state that the full particulars of this work will be found in the various Certificates which I have supplied to our Inspectors. Lady Day, 1876. According to agreement I have made analyses of fifty articles of food of more or less importance; anyhow, of such as have been selected by yourselves, and give a very fair view of the food of the people. The Milks I have examined have been ten in number. One of these, No. 46 was a top-skimming, and doubtless given for a reason. Two of the samples were distinctly adulterated with water—viz., 185 70 and 49. The former had been mixed with from 7 to 8 per cent. of water; but, on account of the fair amount of butter-fat, I could not recommend more than caution. No. 49 however, was a gross case, as mo less than 2.5 per cent. of water had been added. Nos. 44, 65, and 73 were a little below par, but with no amount of added water worthy of mention. Nos 34, 43, 66, and 75, were normal. Of Bread, I have nothing to report but what is favourable. Two of the four samples gave what I thought were very distinct intimation of alum; but further analysis did not bear out the qualitative test. In fact, I find the logwood test more and more unsatisfactory, thus compelling a most troublesome analysis. And now as to Butters. These have been five in number. No. 27 contained scarcely any butter; not only was the melting-point utterly abnormal, not only was it full of semi-crystalline patches, but the amount of insoluble fatty acids was so high as to admit of the presence of but little butter. In view of a prosecution, analyses were made by four chemists, including myself, and with the following results as regards fatty acids: 92.4, 92.53, 92.65, and 92.67. On account of the price of the butter the vendor was simply warned. Nos. 51, 55, and 57, were fair 186 samples of butter. No. 54 contained some vegetable fat, but not in sufficient quantity to warrant a prosecution. As there is still some doubt as to the limit of the fatty acids insoluble in water, I would venture to recommend that a sample of genuine butter should be examined every month with a view of settling what is still in dispute. Two specimens of Lard have been examined Nos. 58 and 63; both have been proved to be of excellent quality, except that No. 63 was a little overheated. The Coffees (Nos. 37, 39, and 59), three in number, were very good. The same may be said of the Pickled Onions (30 and 69) and Cauliflower (62) Two samples of Anchovy Sauce differed very much in quality. No. 60 was of very good colour, taste, and smell; a little oxide of iron was present as usual, and also, by accident, a trace of lead, but not in any quantity to signify. No. 71 contained a far greater proportion of salt (nearly 24 per cent.), and was very rank in smell. Two varieties of Sweets, Cocoa-nut Lozenges (38) and Acid Drops (53) were very good. 187 The Liquorice (No. 48) was of inferior quality, and contained a very large percentage of potato starch, used for the purpose of sopping up and rolling the juice. It had been also very carelessly made as it further contained 1.42 per cent. of sand. But, as there could be no pretence that the vendor had anything to do with the admixture, and as there are far inferior samples in the market, it was considered enough to inform the vendor of the nature of the article. And now to a subject of greater interest although not of greater importance than milk and bread: I allude to Alcoholic Drinks. I will take them in the order of their importance. Ales and Porters were six in number. With reference to these, I would say that hops are used in small quantities, especially in ales marked 50 and 64, much more distinctly in ales 56 and 74. It is very difficult at present to say what the exact nature of the bitter is that is employed; certainly not picrie acid or picrotoxin, or any alkaloidal bitter with which I am acquainted. To what extent burnt sugar confers a bitter taste I am not prepared to state; but that sugar is very largely employed is a well-recognised fact. In the Porter No. 67 I found liquorice, 188 but this cannot be considered injurious. The quantity of proof-spirit varies considerably. I found as follows:— Proof-spirit per cent. No. 68 Porter 8.41 No. 67 Porter 8.79 No. 64 Bitter Ale 7.98 No. 56 Ale 9.91 No, 74 Bitter Ale 10.17 No. 50 Bitter Ale 11.33 Of Wines, I have analyzed four samples—two Sherries and two Ports. One of the Sherries, No. 29 was from a wellknown house. It is a true wine, strongly fortified, and somewhat, though moderately, plastered. From the quantity of sugar which it contained—viz., 4.35 per cent., it would be very deceptive, as it serves o disguise the large amount of alcohol which it contains. Sherry labelled 61 is more plastered and more fortified, but contains less sugar, and is therefore more immediately pronounced as to its alcoholic contents. With reference to Ports, there is also considerable difference. No. 28 is very superior to No. 36 although I suppose the latter would be preferred by 189 the ladies, as it contains so much more glucose or grape sugar (7.04 instead of 4.00). But No. 36 is as much plastered as ordinary sherry. Both of these Ports contain the genuine colouring matter of the grape. I persume the great difference, apart from bouquet, amount of blucose, acids, and salts in wines of high price consists, as regards wholesomeness, in the quality of the added spirit, as to whether it be genuine spirit of wine, or corn spirit. The quantity of proof-spirit in these four wines would show the necessity for caution in their use:- Proof-spirit per cent. 36. Port 34.o6 28. Port 36.56 29. Sherry 37.63 61. Sherry 39.24 As regards Spirits, I have examined two Gins two Brandies, two Rums, and two Liqueurs. With reference to proof-spirit they rank thus:— 41. Aniseed 31.97 33. Aniseed 39.38 26. Gin 56.25 40. Rum 59.82 32. Rum 60.49 35. Gin 73.o8 42. Brown Brandy 80.18 31. Pale Brandy 84.95 190 Aniseed Liqueur is employed, I believe, by nurses and mothers, for the young children. Although its use is altogether to be deprecated, I am thankful to find them free from anything injurious beyond the alcoholic contents, and the latter in moderate quantity. The other spirits almost speak for themselves. No. 26 Gin, Nos. 40 and 32 Rums are singularly weak, especially the latter. And the different effect upon the constitution in the case of two such gins as Nos. 25 and 35 is also sufficiently striking. None of them call for further remark. In presenting this Report may I be permitted to express a hope that in the future my work may be more regularly spread over the allotted time. It is not only more difficult to accomplish the analyses within a given time, but also to carry them on with the necessary supervision on my part. Trusting that my labours will be appreciated by the Vestry, I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BERNAYS, Professor of Chemistry at the St. Thomas's Hospital Medical and Surgical College, &c. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital, S. E. 1375-76. BYE-LAWS of the vestry of ST.
