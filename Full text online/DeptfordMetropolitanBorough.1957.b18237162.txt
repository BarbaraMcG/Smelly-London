To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my pleasing duty to present the Annual Report on the public health in Deptford for 1957. In line with the general trend in most London Boroughs, the population continues to decline although total births exceed deaths. Last year the Infantile Mortality Rate at 25.2 was higher than the average for London, but this year the figure is 12.4 which is gratifying but demonstrates once again the statistical vagaries that occur when dealing with comparatively small figures in a circumscribed area. Significant conclusions on trends in infant welfare and mortality can only be drawn over a period of years, and on this reckoning the position in Deptford is highly satisfactory. Notifiable infectious diseases increased from 508 to 1050 due to the expected biennial recrudescence of measles. Fortunately, Sonne Dysentery was almost absent from the Borough, and this saved the Department much laborious work in tracing contacts, arranging for treatment, and examining bacteriological specimens. The absence of other serious infectious diseases was most satisfactory. Regarding Pulmonary Tuberculosis, notifications increased from 103 to 143, and I include in the body of the report a statement from Dr. Rigby in regard to the excellent work of the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, together with figures from Dr. Morgan, Director of the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit on the results of visits to Deptford in 1957. During the last quarter of the year there was an Influenza epidemic of a comparatively mild type. This epidemic differed from many of its predecessors in the speed with which it spread across the world from the Far East in six months, and which aroused more alarm than its severity justified. Nevertheless, deaths from Bronchitis increased from 78 to 90, although deaths from acute primary Pneumonia only increased slightly. As would be expected, deaths were mostly among the elderly and very young. In connection with the Clean Air Act, a Smoke Control Area has been designated by the Council and a pilot survey has been undertaken preparatory to seeking preliminary Ministerial approval. The year also saw the passing of the Housing Act, 1957, which was a comprehensive consolidating Act embracing complicated legislative measures passed in recent years. The Rent Act was also given the force of law, and has placed on Local Authorities' Health Departments arduous and at times invidious tasks which are rendered all the more difficult by the obscure, and to the uninitiated, the incomprehensible drafting of some of the various sections. In regard to old people's health and welfare, relations with the Geriatric Department at St. Alfege's Hospital continued to be cordial, and there is no waiting list for admission of cases referred by this Department. The Laundry Service provided by the Council is proving a great help and 2 is much appreciated by General Practitioners, Hospital Almoners, District Nurses, and Health Visitors. During the year the Chief Public Health Inspector, Mr. Mayo, retired after 36 years of service. I am glad to place on record my appreciation of Mr. Mayo, both as a colleague and a friend. He was a man widely experienced and skilled in his profession and could always be relied on to give sound technical advice. I wish him many years of happy retirement. The Staff was further depleted by the resignation of a District Public Health Inspector, and the Department was two inspectors below establishment for the remainder of the year. In conclusion I am glad to have the opportunity of thanking the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee for their help and support throughout the year, and I would place on record my appreciation of the loyalty and diligence of the Staff in the Department. I remain, Your obedient Servant, John Kerr Brown, Medical O fficer of Health. 3 STAFF Medical Officer of Health J. Kerr Brown, b.sc., m.b., ch.b., d.p.h. Public Analyst (part time) H.

The proportions of old or young vary in different areas and the Registrar-General gives Area Comparability factors which take these variations into account. The factor for births is 0.96 and for deaths 0.89 and the birth rate and death rate should be multiplied by the appropriate factor when making comparisons with rates in other towns. The figure for population is the estimated mid-year home population. The estimated decrease in the population is 870, whereas the number of births exceed the number of deaths by 176. The table setting out the causes of deaths will be found in the Appendix Table I. The deaths are classified under 36 headings based on the Abbreviated List of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death, 1948.

Section "B" INFECTIOUS DISEASES 8 INFECTIOUS DISEASES General The total number of notifiable infectious diseases showed an increase of 542. The increase was due to the biennial occurrence of Measles, of which there were 819 cases. Whooping Cough, Pneumonia and Erysipelas showed a slight increase but fortunately there was practically no Sonne Dysentery during the year—16 cases as against 265 in 1956. The other notifiable diseases all showed a slight decline. Infectious Diseases.

Tuberculosis All new cases in the Borough, whether or not they are transferred from other areas, are visited by the Public Health Inspectors in order to ascertain the housing conditions and to see if any improvements can, or should, be effected. There was an increase of 40 in the number of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified for the first time (23 male and 17 female) but the number of deaths due to respiratory tuberculosis in Deptford in 1957 was again down as compared with the previous year, i.e., 10 males and 2 females as compared with 12 and 3 respectively. Of the deaths from respiratory tuberculosis 5 of the male deaths and one female death were of persons between the ages of 15 and 65 years, whereas of the deaths from all causes, only about 27 % were within this age group. 9 Tuberculosis Register Pulmonary Non-Pulmonary M F Total M F Total Cases notified for the first time 97 46 143 2 6 8 Posthumous notifications. 1 2 3 1 — 1 New cases in Borough coming to knowledge otherwise than by primary notification 24 18 42 2 — 2 I am indebted to the Chest Physician, Dr. J. P. V. Rigby, for the following report concerning the Chest Clinic at Harton Street, which is of great interest:— Cases on Chest Clinic Register at 31.12.57:— Definite 1,198 Observation 58 Number of new contacts examined 431 Total attendance at the Chest Clinic 7,278 Total attendance at the Refill Clinic 10 TUBERCULOSIS CARE COMMITTEE Interviews by Secretary Cases assisted by Care Committee 36+(26)* Sums raised by Christmas Seal Sale, 1957 £148 12s. 5d. •Cases helped with clothing by Secretary. I also send you, briefly summarised, the number of deaths from respiratory tuberculosis, from 1953 to 1957 inclusive. This shows a steady decline which is part of a national decline of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis as such. The number of deaths of patients on the tuberculosis register who have died from other causes is given alongside the other figure. 1957 shows a rather striking increase in these cases, indicating that the tuberculosis has been rendered relatively benign by treatment, and other more lethal conditions have supervened. Deaths from Tuberculosis Deaths from other causes 1953 21 1 1954 18 4 1955 13 1 1956 16 1 1957 12 6 Parallel with the decline in the incidence of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosed during the years 1953 to 1957, is the increase in the number of new cases of non-tuberculous chest diseases seen at the chest clinic. The following is a table showing the numbers of new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in the years 1953 to 1957 diagnosed at Deptford. By com- 10 parison I give a table showing the number of new cases of non-tuberculous chest diseases seen at the chest clinic during the same years. Tuberculous Cases diagnosed at Deptford Non-tuberculous chest cases seen at the clinic Abnormalities 1953 126 1,042 469 1954 131 1,051 476 1955 133 1,135 533 1956 86 974 468 1957 129 1,529 744 The figure of abnormalities may appear to be high, but it includes all forms of bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, new growths of the lungs and heart abnormalities, including other less significant abnormalities in smaller numbers. These figures will indicate the change in the function of the chest clinic. The new cases referred to are persons sent to the chest clinic with an introductory letter from the private doctor for investigation of chest symptoms of one sort or another. Mass Miniature Radiography The Director of the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit has supplied me with figures on the results of the visits to this Unit to Deptford in 1957. These figures include public surveys and visits to factories, Carrington House and Goldsmiths' College.

The total number of primary inspections decreased from 6,305 in 1956 to 5,907. The number of complaints was again reduced from 1,665 to 1,283—and although we lost two Public Health Inspectors during the year, one from retirement and one to another Metropolitan Borough, the Inspectors were able to carry out routine duties and to cope with the sudden increase of work due to the coming into force of the Rent Act, 1957. Defects found were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council (General Powers) Acts and the London County Conncil Bye-Laws. Offensive Trade The sole remaining factory in the Borough classed as an Offensive Trade closed at the end of October, and has now been demolished. Clean Air Act, 1956 It was not necessary to undertake legal proceedings or any action other than informal during the year. A station for measuring atmospheric pollution is set up in the Public Health Department building, and results and details are sent to the Fuel Research Station at Greenwich. The Council approved a proposal to make a small Smoke Control Area in the S.W. corner of the Borough, and abutting on the Boroughs of Camberwell and Lewisham. The area is approximately 43.5 acres and consists of 678 houses, 78 flats, 8 shops and one school. A pilot survey was carried out in order to obtain a rough assessment of the fuel requirements. Further action will be undertaken in 1958. Rodent Control One Rodent Supervisor and two operators were employed throughout the year under the general direction of the Chief Public Health Inspector, and the following tables summarise the work carried out:— 13 PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 Report for the Year ended 31st December, 1957 Type of Property Non-Agricultural (1) Local Authority (2) Dwelling Houses (including Council Houses) (3) All other (including business premises) (4) Total of Cols.

Number of "Block" control schemes carried out — 4 — 4 — A high proportion of business premises in the Borough have their own contracts with private service companies for the control and destruction of rats and mice. This largely accounts for the smallness of the figure relating to business premises. Disinfection and Cleansing The following is a summary of the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing:— 15 Premises disinfected (infectious disease) 55 Premises disinfected (requests) 203 Premises disinfected (verminous condition) 254 Total number of articles disinfected 13,668 Books disinfected 63 Number of articles destroyed at owner's request 405 In addition there was a small amount of disinfection undertaken on behalf of the Admiralty in respect of stores of bedding at the Royal Victoria Yard, Grove Street, Deptford, and £15 18s. 9d. was received from the Admiralty in respect of this service. Bathing Station Number of school children who received baths (other than for scabies) 1,036 Number of school children who received baths for the treatment of scabies and impetigo 57 Adults who received baths (other than for scabies):— Female 69 Male 254 Scabies baths for adults:— Female 30 Male 6 Laundry In the early part of the year the Public Health Committee decided to institute a laundry service for aged infirm people in the Borough, who are incontinent and who have difficulty in obtaining someone to wash and cleanse their bedclothes and personal underclothing, etc. The laundry commenced operations during July, and letters and messages show that the service was badly needed and has been greatly appreciated by patients, District Nurses and Home Helps. The equipment consists of a Washing Machine, Hydro, extractor and Ironing Machine, and the work is carried out by the Bathing Station and Disinfecting staff. The only additional staff required was an existing part-time bathing station attendant who became engaged full time. Number of patients 28 Number of collections and deliveries 782 Number of articles cleansed 4,129 Water Supply The water supply for domestic purposes for the whole of the Borough is obtained from the mains of the Metropolitan Water Board. Routine bacteriological examination is not normally carried out by the Council but the Water Board have supplied information on the bacteriological purity when requested. 16 The water supply has been fully satisfactory throughout the year. Certificates in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, that dwelling houses had a proper and efficient water supply were issued in respect of 225 new premises. THE FACTORIES ACT, 1937 The following is an epitomised statement of the administration of the Act. The inspections, visits, etc., are carried out by the District Public Health Inspectors. Inspections Number on Register Number of Inspections Notices Written Occupiers Prosecuted (1) Factories in which Sections 1, 2, 3,4 and 6 are to be enforced by Local Authorities 50 47 — (2) Factories not included in (1) in which Section 7 is enforced by the Local Authority 337 173 — — Defects Found Referred Sanitary Conveniences : Found Remedied To H.M.

Section "D" FOOD AND DRUGS AND REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST 20 FOOD AND DRUGS A full-time Food Inspector is employed in the supervision of Food and Food Premises. Food Samples are sent for chemical analysis to the Public Analyst, and for bacteriological examination to County Hall. Details of the work of the Food Inspector will be found in the Appendix Tables, V, VI and VII and details from the Public Analyst's Report are included at the end of this section. Royal Victoria Yard Considerable quantities of food no longer considered fit for prolonged storage by the Admiralty, are examined in order to assess their fitness for sale to the general public. 178 Evelyn Street Details will be found in Appendix VI. Ice-Cream Forty-one samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Grade I 25 Grade II 11 Grade III 1 Grade IV 4 41 Public Health (Preservatives etc. in Food) Regulations Wherever desirable, Food and Drugs Act samples were examined for the presence of prohibited preservatives and colouring matters and for excessive amounts of the permitted preservatives. Five infringements were dealt with informally. School Milks Fifteen samples were sent for chemical examination and eighteen were sent for bacteriological examination. Milk (Special Designations) Act Thirty-six samples were submitted. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949-53 Dealers Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 24 Pasteurised Milk 70 Sterilised Milk 96 Supplementary Licences issued: Tuberculin Tested Milk 15 Pasteurised Milk 15 Sterilised Milk 17 21 Slaughterhouses There are two Slaughterhouses licensed in the Borough.

These samples were also examined, where appropriate, under the various Orders concerning Food Standards and Food Labelling made under the Defence (Sale of Food) Regulations, 1943, and continued in operation by virtue of Section 136 and the Twelfth Schedule of the new Act. Prepacked drugs were also examined under the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. The Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D.(Lond.), A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., has submitted the following report on milk sampling:— I have pleasure in furnishing the following particulars concerning the composition of the milk samples submitted for analysis during the year 1957. Forty-eight samples of milk were submitted during the year, all of which were taken informally. None was found to be adulterated, but six samples contained slightly less than the legal minimum limit of 8.5% of milk-solids other than milk-fat. Five of these samples were submitted in the January-April period, when the seasonal decline in quality usually becomes apparent, and as the freezing points were found to be within normal limits the milks were regarded as "genuine". "The average composition of the samples analysed is shown in the following Table, with the averages of previous years for comparison. AVERAGE COMPOSITION OF MILK, DEPTFORD Period Fat Solids-not-fat Total Solids 1947 3.51 8.68 1219 1948 3.45 8.72 12.17 1949 3.47 8.74 12.21 1950 3.44 8.70 12.14 1951 3.52 8.63 12.15 1952 3.48 8.69 12.17 1953 3.44 8.69 12.13 1954 3.45 8.72 12.17 1955 3.50 8.64 12.14 1956 3.64 8.70 12.34 1957 3.61 8.66 12.27 As may be seen, the averages show very little variation since the end of the War, due no doubt to the Metropolitan supply now being composed almost entirely of bulked milk. Section "E" HOUSING 24 HOUSING At the end of 1957 the Council had a total of 970 permanent houses, maisonettes and flats, a total of 314 temporary houses of various types and controlled a further 517 properties under requisition. The requisitioned properties housed 786 units of tenancy. During the year, 15 flats and 4 maisonettes were completed for the Council. Also, 2,567 improvements were carried out in 807 houses, somewhat less than last year, and outstanding works at the end of the year totalled 219. Apart from the flats, etc., completed by the Council 188 flats were completed by the London County Council, and 9 houses, 2 maisonettes and 17 flats were completed by private owners. In the maintenance of existing property the following is a summary of the work done in 1957:— Public Health (London) Act, 1936 Total number of houses inspected for housing defects 1,381 Number of Statutory Notices served 256 Number of houses repaired or nuisances remedied 807 Overcrowding Number of individual dwellings overcrowded at the end of the year 50 Number of families found to be living in overcrowded conditions during the year 3 Number of families who have obtained alternative accommodation during the year — There are many underground rooms throughout the Borough and a fairly high proportion of them, although used as dwellings, do not conform in all respects with the statutory requirements and cannot without major structural alterations be made to do so. Closure is not, however, practicable in present circumstances and owners have been co-operative in making these rooms reasonably fit. Rent Act, 1957, and Housing Repairs and Rents Act and Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts One hundred and sixty-two applications for Certificates of Disrepair were made during the year. One hundred and fifty-three were granted and the remainder were either refused or the application withdrawn. Section "F" PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES 26 PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES (London County Council) The headquarters of the Divisional Medical Officer (Dr. F. R. Waldron) are at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the services which are provided by the London County Council at the various clinics ire as follows:— Health Centre, Amersham Road, S.EAA. Infant Welfare, Toddlers, and Ante-Natal Clinics. Vaccination and Immunisation. Foot Clinic. Mothercraft Class. Day Nursery. Artificial Sunlight, Simple Massage and Exercises Clinic Domestic Help Service, St. George's Hall, Shardeloes Road, S.E.4. Infant Welfare and Ante-natal Clinics. St. Luke's Hall, Gosterwood Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. Princess Louise Institute, Hales Street, S.E.8. Infant Welfare Clinic. St. John's Nurses' Home, Watson Street, S.E.8. Ante-natal Clinic. School Treatment Centre, Reginald Square. Dental Clinic. Vision Clinic. Speech Therapy. Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic. Orthoptic Clinic. Audiology Clinic. Welfare Foods Service National Welfare Food items are available for issue at the Health Centre, Amersham Road; Princess Louise Institute Clinic; St. George's Hall Clinic; St. Luke's Hall Clinic at certain times. These items are also available at St. Paul's House, Deptford High Street, S.E.8, and the Women's Voluntary Services, 302 New Cross Road, S.E.14. Section " G " MISCELLANEOUS 28 MISCELLANEOUS Canal Boats Act The section of the Grand Surrey Canal passing through the Borough was kept under observation by the District Inspector but no canal boats were found of a type requiring inspection. Common Lodging Houses There is only one Common Lodging House in the Borough. This is Carrington House which is maintained by the London County Council. This building was erected in 1903 and it contains 814 separate cubicles, for use by men only. In addition to the usual facilities for washing and bathing, there is a reading room and a smoking room. The dining room is provided with a large stove on which the men can cook their own meals, and in addition, there is a canteen which provides excellent meals at a low price. A sick bay is provided on the ground floor for cases awaiting admission to hospital. No nursing of any sort is provided but sick persons are not so isolated as they would be in cubicles on an upper floor, and serious or dangerous illness is less likely to be overlooked. The standard of accommodation is high and it compares favourably with many of the rooms occupied by single elderly men throughout the district. Laboratory Service Food samples are normally sent to the Medical Research Laboratory at County Hall, but clinical items, e.g., faeces specimens, continue to be sent to the Park Hospital Laboratories. The facilities at the Devonport Laboratory, Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, are occasionally used by general practitioners for the examination of swabs and other specimens. Mortuary and Coroner's Court Before the war both the Boroughs of Deptford and Greenwich maintained their own mortuaries and coroner's courts. By arrangement, and following war damage, the coroner's court at Deptford and the mortuary at Greenwich have been closed. The mortuary at Watson Street, Deptford, serves parts of Greenwich and Woolwich, in addition to Deptford. The number of bodies received at the mortuary is, as a result of this arrangement, greatly increased. The total number of bodies received during 1957 was 522, of which 215 were received from Greenwich and 205 from Woolwich. A fee of £1 1s. Od. per body is paid by the Greenwich and Woolwich Borough Councils in respect of these admissions. National Assistance Act, 1948 Burial of the Dead Under Section 50 of the above Act it is the duty of the Council to 29 arrange for the burial or cremation of any person who dies or is found dead within the Borough, and where no private arrangements are made for the disposal of the remains. Nine persons were buried under the provisions of this Act during 1957. Removal of Aged and Infirm Persons to Institutions Section 47 of this Act provides for securing the necessary care and attention for the aged and chronic sick by means of an order of the Court. Several cases were removed either to hospital or County Council homes for the aged after persuasion, but it was not necessary to invoke Section 47 during the year. Services for Old People The voluntary services in the district provide some assistance and recreation for old people. The W.V.S. have organised five "Darby and Joan" Clubs in various parts of the Borough so that one or more is within reasonable reach of persons living in any part of the District. In addition, the Albany Institute Old People's Club, although situated just beyond the Borough boundary, is patronised mainly by Deptford people. I give details regarding our "Meals on Wheels' service which is carried out in co-operation with the Women's Voluntary Services Organisation. Meals are provided to about 130 old people each week. The meals are obtained from the United Girls Schools for Social Services at a cost of Is. 8d. per meal, for which the individuals pay lOd. and the London County Council pay a subsidy of lOd. per meal. The Council pay the United Girls Schools monthly for the cost of the meals. 11,183 meals were provided during the year. The Deptford Borough Council provide a vehicle (which was presented by a local fiim) and a driver, to deliver about 40 meals twice a week to house-bound old folk and the remainder of the meals to "Darby and Joan " Clubs. The W.V.S. provide the helpers for delivery of meals. Shops Act, 1950 In the course of their routine inspection the Sanitary Inspectors paid attention to the ventilation and temperature of shops and the provision of washing accommodation and sanitary conveniences. Baths and Wash-Houses The Council maintains three swimming baths at Laurie Grove adjoining the Town Hall. A plant giving continuous filtration and sterilisation maintains the purity of the water at all times. The plant is capable of filtering the whole of the water in the baths within four hours and the system of " break-point" chlorination ensures the purity and safety of the water even during periods of maximum use. 30 Two of the swimming baths are open all the year, but the large bath is closed from October until April, during which time a sprung floor is put in place and the building is used as a hall. In addition to the swimming baths there are 60 slipper baths for public use at Laurie Grove. At the Evelyn Baths, Clyde Street, there are 60 slipper baths and facilities for Russian Vapour Baths and Foam Baths, and in addition a public wash-house is provided. At the baths at Uderton Road 18 slipper baths are provided. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Eight applications for licences were received, and all were approved by the Council and granted. Medical Examinations During the year 35 examinations were carried out to ascertain if people appointed to the Council's Permanent Staff were fit for admission to the Superannuation Scheme. Fifty-nine examinations of sick employees were also made during the year and reports submitted thereon. Conferences The Council was represented at Conferences during the year as follows: Royal Society for Promotion of Health—Folkestone. The Vice-Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor Walter Taylor, J.P.) and the Medical Officer of Health. National Smoke Abatement Society—Hastings. Councillor Mrs. F. K. Dolby and Mr. A. C. Webster, Chief Public Health Inspector. Sanitary Inspectors' Association—Eastbourne. Councillor Mrs. F. K. Dolby and Mr. H. E. Green, Public Health Inspector.
