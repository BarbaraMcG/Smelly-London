Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Williams and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1950. The District is divided into three Wards: Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4.925. The Home population as estimated by the Registrar General is 43,730. This is an increase compared with the 1949 figure of 43,690. The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops. A small number continue to work in agriculture. The sum represented by a penny rate is £1,296 11s. 2d.

The overcrowded conditions under which many people are living, resulting from the shortage of houses is almost certainly helping to keep the numbers of new notifications at a comparatively high figure, but it must also be remembered that a number of these cases are mild ones which have been detected at an early stage by the use of mass radiography. The adequate housing of persons suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis and their families is essential if increases in new cases of this disease are to be prevented. 8 Maternal Mortality I regret to report that there has been one case of maternal mortality during the year. During the previous three years there have been no maternal deaths. Housing There are still very many families sharing accommodation or living in one or two rooms. These families are mostly young couples, living often with their parents and in many cases trying to raise a young family under most difficult and trying conditions. The need for houses is still urgent, although the Housing Committee's programme of building has already provided 825 permanent houses and 150 temporary bungalows by the end of the year. Diphtheria Immunisation Responsibility for carrying out diphtheria immunisation passed to the Middlesex County Council on the 5th July, 1948, in accordance with the provisions of the National Health Service Act. Since the end of 1948 all arrangements for immunisation have been carried out by the County Council. Water Analysis 1. The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District are supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co. and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South West Suburban Water Co. is taken by that Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supply has been satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. 2. Samples for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis are taken at least five times each week by the Metropolitan Water Board of the raw water and the treated water at all stages of purification, and weekly samples have been taken by the South West Suburban Water Go. In addition six samples were taken by my department. 9 Average Results of Analyses of Metropolitan Water Board Supply. (Parts per million.)

Bact. coli. Absent from 100 ml. Cl. welchii Reaction Present in 100ml. Absent from 10 ml. This sample is clear and bright in appearance, has a reaction on the alkaline side of neutrality and is free from metals. The water is hard in character but its hardness and its content of mineral and saline constituents in solution are not excessive. It is of satisfactory organic quality and of a high standard of bacterial purity. These results are indicative of a water which is pure and wholesome in character and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. 3. The water supplied has no plumbo-solvent action but samples are tested for presence of metals. 4 No action has been required in respect of contamination of the water. All water is chlorinated before distribution. 5. With the exception of a few outlying cottages, all the houses in the area are supplied from the public water mains. Only a very limited number of houses are supplied by standpipes common to two or more houses, the vast majority being supplied direct. Population supplied with water from standpipes is approximately 70. 11 Food Poisoning No cases of food poisoning have been notified during the year. Conclusion In conclusion I should like to thank the members of the Committee for the support which they have given me during the year and also to thank Mr. Bell and the staff of the department for their able and willing assistance.

WOODS, Medical Officer of Health. 12 CHIEF SANITARY INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing The effects of the housing shortage continued to be a pre-occupation of the department and this shortage continued despite the substantial number of new houses which the Council have already provided. Many people living under unsatisfactory conditions solicited the aid of the department with a view to re-housing. Where it was considered that a useful purpose would be served reports were submitted for the consideration of the Housing Committee but cases did occur of people who needed re-housing but for one reason or another were not eligible for consideration under the Council's "points" scheme. In these cases there was little that could be done to assist. All housing applicants were visited by the sanitary inspectors before they were finally interviewed by the Housing Committee and I believe that these fact-finding inspections did help the Committee to assess those applicants with the greatest need. In addition to the needs of those people without a house of their own there was the problem of the families housed in unsatisfactory and unfit dwellings. Following consideration by the Public Health Committee of reports which I submitted, it was decided that the Council would deal with thirty unfit dwellings a year including the re-housing of the occupants. Although this number was not large it did mean that a definite programme could be arranged for dealing with the worst of the known unfit dwellings and by the end of the year twenty-three demolition orders had been made, others were in the process of being considered and a start had been made on re-housing the occupants. Efforts were made to thoroughly repair some of the older properties under Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1936, but there were great difficulties in the way. The increased cost of building repairs and the extensive works often necessary brought one up against the "reasonable expense" clause with the alternative of action under Section 11 and yet these houses cannot adequately be dealt with under the Public Health Act. 13 Milk 137 samples of graded milks were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. Of these only one sample of pasteurised (South Devon) milk failed the methylene blue test. Ice Cream 79 samples of ice cream were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Service at Epsom. These samples were graded at follows:— Provisional Grades 1 1 & 2 3 4 Samples taken (Total 79) 50 67 9 3 % of total samples 63.29 84.80 11.39 3.79 No. in which Coliforms present in 1/10 ml. 3 9 6 2 % in which Coliforms present 6 13.43 66.66 66.66 No. in which Faecal B. Coli present 1 3 3 — % in which Faecal B. Coli present 2 4.47 33.33 — These results showed a marked improvement on those for the previous year and there are several factors contributing to this. A much larger proportion of the ice cream sold in the district was wrapped, partly due, I believe, to our activities in previous years, the increased supplies of ice cream by reputable companies whose names are well known and preferred by the public and thirdly, many of the less reliable manufacturers appear to have gone out of business or at least are not supplying ice cream to Feltham. In all cases notification of the results of sampling was given to the manufacturer, the retailer and the Authority in whose district the ice cream was manufactured, and it was found that many manufacturers appreciated receiving good results as well as unsatisfactory ones. 14 There were no large manufacturers of ice cream in the area, the majority of retailers purchased their ice cream from outside sources and only a very small number made their own. Food Premises During the year the Council made byelaws with regard to the handling, wrapping and delivery of food and the sale of food in the open air, and towards the end of the year a start was made towards the regular periodical visiting of all food premises including the food stores of hawkers of foodstuffs. A circular letter was sent to all the food traders with regard to the coming into operation of the new food byelaws and their co-operation was sought to improve their premises where necessary and to give effect to the new byelaws, but much remains to be done and I am convinced that if the department can maintain regular visits to these premises the best and most lasting results will be obtained. Rodent Control Rodent destruction in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries was continued. The annual test baiting of the Council's sewers showed slight infestation in small areas and this was dealt with. The Council refuse tip is kept under observation and any signs of rat activity dealt with immediately. Dustbins Increasing opposition was displayed by owners who received notices requiring them to supply new dustbins and in one case a large property-owning company took an appeal against a notice from the Council to the Court of Quarter Sessions where the appeal was upheld and the Council involved in heavy legal expenses. After a good deal of consideration the Public Health Committee recommended and the Council adopted a, scheme to supply all residential properties in the district with dustbins free of charge, the cost of the scheme to be included in the general rate. 15 Staff I should like to take this opportunity of thanking Dr. Woods for the consideration he has shown me, and the members of the staff for their support in carrying out the work of the department.
