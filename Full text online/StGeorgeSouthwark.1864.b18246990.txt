EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE VESTRY. PREFATORY NOTE. The Eighth Annual Report of the Vestry of this Parish, being that for the Year ending on the 25th March, 1864, is prepared in pursuance of the Provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts, and submitted to the Parishioners and the Public. As usual the particulars of the Sanitary condition of the Parish will be found in the Eeport of the Medical Officer of Health and the various Tables comprised therein. The Vestry Accounts and other statements now given afford a general view of the operations of the Vestry. The several Accounts of the Churchwardens relating to the Rector's Eate, the Third Service Fund, and the various Parochial Charities, are subjoined; and also those of the Overseers in respect of the Poor Eate, the General Eate, the Sewers Eate, and the Metropolitan Main Drainage Eate. The Account of the Eeceipts and Expenditure of the Guardians during the Year and the Statistics of Pauper Eelief in the Parish are also given. The Vestry has caused to be appended to this Eeport, as to that of 1860, the List of Estates and Charitable Foundations or Bequests. During a portion of the current year the Vestry and the Vestry Clerk have been engaged in endeavouring to obtain through the Charity Commissioners, more satisfactory arrangements with regard to these Estates and Charities, and it is hoped that before the close of the year such arrangements may, greatly to the advantage of the Parish, be to a large extent completed. Every Parishioner who may apply at the Vestry Hall for a copy of this Eeport will be furnished with one without charge. DANIEL BIRT, Vestry Clerk.

ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY.DAY, 1864. Mr Chairman and Gentlemen, The year which ended the 2nd April, 1864, has been characterised by its unhealthiness; whilst at the same time it has been remarkable for the fineness of its weather, and for its plentiful seasons. Everywhere have the fields been yellow with the harvest; and everywhere has fruit covered the trees, and grass the meadows ; nevertheless, sickness has been upon the face of the people. Many other years have passed, when to our view circumstances appeared more unfavourable to health, yet they have recorded a far smaller rate of mortality. There are influences at work within and without us, with reference to which our knowledge is limited; influences hitherto hidden in obscurity; and which await long and patient.toil to bring them out into the light. The atmosphere alone, with its changes chemical and physical, remains a wide field for the student; aud one which will reward his labours with a rich success. For, although, we may never be able to give snow like wool; nor scatter the hoar frost like ashes; nor cast forth ice like morsels; nor cause the winds to blow, and the waters to flow; yet, by discovering the laws which govern these irresistible powers of nature, we may be enabled to prevent them afflicting us with those evils, which now sicken and destroy the people. Just as Admiral Fitzroy, from his knowledge of the weather, telegraphs to the farthest ports, giving warning of the coming storm, whilst the sky is calm and cloudless, and the sea without a ripple: soon the tempest sweeps along, carrying havoc and destruction; but the mariner heeds it not, for be remains within, and saves his wealth, and ship, and life. The births of 2132 children were registered in the year; and they were one to every 26 of the population; 1053 were boys, and 1079 were girls. 1689 persons died in the year; and the annual rate of mortality was 30 per 1000: a higher rate than has happened for some years. 819 of these were males, and 870 were females. 12 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark.

The sudden and large increase of deaths during the first and following weeks of the year, was unprecedented out of the Cholera years. The temperature of Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1863. 13 the air was 26.7°, 9.3° below the average of the same week in 43 years. Cold is destructive; under its influence Nature becomes torpid and dumb. "The frost which braces the nerves of the hardy and strong, chills the veins of the aged and weakly." It shakes them into their graves, as the autumnal winds shake from off the trees the fruit fully ripe. And not only do the aged suffer during this rigorous period, but the young also, and those who are labouring under organic disease, especially of the heart and lungs. These diseases affect alike the respiration, and circulation, producing that state of system, which yields helplessly to the depressing influence of cold. "And it is in the night undoubtedly that the respiratory organs are most frequently injured, when the water freezes in the bed.rooms of houses that are not warmed by fires, or by warm air diffused by Dr. Arnott's and other admirable inventions." TABLE 3. LUNG DISEASES, INCLUDING PHTHISIS. 1859—60 1860—1 1861—2 1862—3 1863—4 Phthisis 210 173 194 197 222 Bronchitis 130 105 108 139 203 Pneumonia 86 90 78 94 106 There have been recorded 338 deaths from lung diseases, excluding Consumption; 203 were caused by bronchitis, which were 64 in excess of those of the preceding year; and 106 by pneumonia, 12 in excess. Consumption has been fatal in 222 cases. This disease, which is always far ahead in its fatality of all others, has been closely followed by bronchitis. It pursues its career in spite of all the attention that has been paid to it, and in spite of the numerous remedies that have from time to time been extolled as beneficial. Doubtless it has been somewhat checked, by the partial removal of the earlier causes which give rise to it. The means of prevention of those diseases that undermine the constitution, and which induce a feeble and deteriorated condition of the body, so frequently followed by deposition of tubercle must be diligently sought after; and none are more powerful to this end than zymotic diseases. "To no kind of Sanitary measures" writes Dr. Aitken "are we more indebted for this result than to the influence of vaccination, in diminishing small pox—a disease which of all others seems to have tended to the developement of tubercular cachexia as a sequel to its existence." We must remember, that thousands are destroyed from this disease by the kind of occupation followed, and thousands more will be sacrificed before any remedial means can be found, or, put into operation when found: for strange to say, the workmen do not desire to have their trades made more healthy, lest they should become over.crowded, and wages lessened: they prefer high wages and a short life; and in some trades a man is old at 40 years. Draining, cleansing, and the like, important as they are, do not exhaust all the requirements of sanitary science. Luxury claims its victims, and it finds them ready. Death is in the painting of our walls, in the gilding of our cornices, in the manufacture of our mirrors, in the weaving of our drapery, and in many other of the trades by which our works of art and conveniences are supplied. There is also an increase in deaths from Zymotic diseases; these out.number by 73 those of the year 1862—3. Typhus has been fatal in 113 cases: 25 more have been destroyed than in the previous year. In all London there have been registered 3,019 deaths; hence this district has not suffered alone. There exists cause for discouragement 14 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. when we think that after all which has been done in the way of sanitary improvement, a disease like this, considered essentially preventable should still attack and destroy so many of the people. The main reason for this is, I think, its contagious nature. It has a specific cause similar to that of scarlatina, and analagous diseases, and is always present, in a greater or less degree of activity. Numbers of cases which have occurred in this district we have fairly traced to contagion. But we may know right well the cause of a disease, yet be powerless to prevent the effect. A poor man comes seeking shelter in the Workhouse, or in a Refuge; he enters ailing, not knowing what is the matter with him; or, if indeed, there is anything the matter beyond wretchedness, want, and weariness; by the time morning comes he is worse; the symptoms show the onset of a fever, he has slept surrounded by others, and all in that state mentally and bodily, which renders them most susceptible of imbibing poison; and so it spreads wherever taken, whether in Hospitals, Workhouses, or Infirmaries. What can be done? The man must rest somewhere, and where he is, there is danger. The marvel is, that when once fever has been brought into, or has arisen in any of our destitute localities, that it does not spread more widely, and exercise a deadlier influence. The materials for such a consequence are present; there is want and overcrowding; and neglect of cleanliness, personal and domestic. A sanitary writer has said, that the getting of fever into a town is like the getting of vermin into a house, it is most difficult to be got out again. This subject must be examined in a wider and more impartial spirit than we have hitherto done, otherwise we shall fall back with baffled hopes, and cowed spirits, and be ready to ask " What good ?" Typhus has been gradually increasing ever since 1860—1; the registration has run thus, 25, 48, 88, and 113. Diarrhœa is a disease of temperature, and rises and falls with the heat of the summer months. It has numbered 63 deaths.

Mental cultivation is pitted against physical developement, and both are injured. "Intellectual cultivation sows the seeds of physical deterioration; and the evils inflicted on the flesh fail not to grow up and ultimately retaliate with interest on the spirit. The besetting sin of the present generation is that of reading and thinking. A vigorous circulation is necessary to a vigorous contractility, that is, health and strength; and that vigorous contractility is incompatible with a high degree of susceptibility. One of the first effects of civilisation is to substitute the labour of the brain for the labour of the hands and feet. Bodily imbecility and enfeebled health are invariably consequent upon a sedentary life; all go to prove that man was destined to live a life of physical activity" (Johnson.) Twenty children were suffocated in bed, their ages ranging from 4 days, to 14 months. A male aged 51 died from rupture of the small intestines, in consequence of a fall in the street. Three deaths have been referred to fracture of the skull; one, that of a boy, from a fall through a loophole; another a woman 55, from falling down stairs; and the third, a male aged 63, from being run over by a Hansom Cab. A man was poisoned by an over dose of Laudanum. Two females 54 and 70, were burnt to death, from their clothes taking fire; and a child was scalded to death. A male aged 43 hung himself; another 44 died in Bethlehem Hospital, from refusal to take food; a third blew out his brains with a pistol; and a woman cut open her abdomen with a razor, when her bowels gushed out. An infant 14 days old, died from bleeding from the sublingual artery, being injured during an operation ; another newly born was found wilfully murdered; another with a piece of list tied tightly around its neck; and one was found dead on the Cathedral steps. Two deaths were attributed to destitution. A young man died from arsenical poisoning, the result of working in an Artificial Flower Warehouse. The death of a young man, a Banker's Clerk, was referred to an overtasked brain. A female resident in the Workhouse reached 90 years of age. And whilst speaking of age, I may mention that there were thirteen Applicants for Sayer and Shaw's Charity, whose united ages amounted to 1041 years, giving an average of 80 years, and 28 days each. According to the requirements of the Bakehouse Regulation Act of 1863, we have visited the places in which are baked for profit Bread, Biscuits, or Confectionary. We were with one exception kindly received; and every means were afforded us for inspection. In no case were there persons under 18 years of age employed in the night. Promises were given to lime wash the bakehouses, and the passages, and staircases leading thereto, according to the requirements of the Act. There was no sleeping room on the same level with the bakehouse, which contravened the Act. In two places pigs were kept; two others had each a common privy in the bakehouse. These were speedily removed. We inspected them again on the 4th, 6th, and 7th inst. Thirty one of the bakeries were situated in the basement, fifty two on the ground floor, and in one case there was a bakery in both places. The mean temperature for the year 1863 at Greenwich was 50°3; or 1°9 above the average of 92 years. The winter which was exceedingly mild, was also exceedingly unhealthy. There was with a few days exception, a daily excess of 4°¾ of temperature during the first quarter. The temperature of December was also in excess; and the mean temperature of the three winter months, viz., December, January, and February, was 42°5 16 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. and is distinguished by being one of the warmest on record. The mean temperature of the quarter was 4q6. The weather in February, and March, was dry and mild. The degree of humidity was less than its average in January and March, and nearly of its average value in February. The pressure of the atmosphere was in defect in January and March, and in excess in February. Fog prevailed on 51 days. The rain fall was 39 inches. The Temperature of the spring quarter, was with the exception of a few days, an average of two degrees in excess daily from the beginning of April, until the middle of May. This was followed by nine days of a deficiency of six degrees; and succeeded by one of like duration, but of an opposite character, the average daily excess being 3°¼. There was a deficiency from the 5th June, to the end of the quarter. The temperature for the five months ending April of the year, was as high as any on record. The days and nights, in April were warm; and the nights in May; whilst the days of June were cold. The mean temperature for the quarter was 53°0. The degree of humidity differed little from its monthly average value in any of the months. Fog prevailed on 38 days. Bain fell to the amount of 5°6 inches. The weather of the quarter of July, August, and September, was characterised by its changeableness, heat and cold alternating. There were two warm, and two cold periods. The temperature of the air for the first half of July, was in excess, a cold period then commenced, and which continued until the end of the month; this was again followed by an increase of temperature, lasting until the middle of August, when it fell. "From the 17th August to the end of September, a period of 45 days, the daily deficiency amounted to 2°¼." In July and August the days were warm, as were also the nights in the last month; "in September both the days and nights were cold." "The degree of humidity was in defect during the quarter. The pressure of the atmosphere was in excess in July; and in defect in August and September. The fall of rain was 5'9 inches. The mean temperature for the quarter was 58'°8. The death rate in this quarter was exceedingly high; and much sickness prevailed everywhere. The weather of the last quarter of the year "presented some peculiarities." A warm period set in about the middle of October, and continued until near the end; then the weather became variable; some days being in excess of temperature, others below. From the end of October to the beginning of December the weather "was unusually rough." "violent storms" occurred, "and swept the face of the earth." carrying with them blessings and calamities. The degree of humidity was below its average in December. The pressure of the atmosphere was below its average in October, and above in November and December. Fog prevailed on 66 days. The rain fall was 46 inches. The mean temperature 46°8 ; 3°2 above the average of 92 years.* I give as usual an analysis made by Dr. Eobert Dundas Thomson, F. E. S., of the water consumed by us. Considerable variation takes place as regards its purity from month to month, depending greatly upon the rain fall. * The above account of the weather, is compiled from the quarterly returns of the Registrar General.

Upon examination it will be found that these deaths are not distributed amongst them as we might have anticipated. In streets where noxious Trades are carried on, those more especially connected with the decomposition of animal matter, we should have felt confident of meeting with a large mortality; and that in them, Zymotic diseases would manifest themselves in their most malignant and fatal type. But this is not so. In Green Street, where nearly all these Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health—1863. 19 Trades are centred, there have but two deaths happened, one from Typhus, and one from Convulsions. And what is still more remarkable, is, that whilst Cholera was ravaging streets on every side, this almost, or altogether escaped. "Certain at least it is" writes Dr. Greenhow, "that districts in which the most powerful putrid odours tainted the air, have sometimes almost entirely escaped, while others contiguous to them have suffered severely." The same facts have been observed in other countries, where the like circumstances have prevailed. At Montfaucon, in Paris, where during forty years, 400,000 horses were slaughtered, and 11,500,000 dogs and cats; a place, Parent Duchatelet describes, as giving off from huge heaps of flesh left to putrify in the open air for months, as well as from mountains of partially cleaned bones, and also from a soil sodden with blood and other animal liquids, so horrible a stench, as to render it almost unapproachable to visitors,—yet, even here there was a remarkable exemption from Cholera, whilst all "around was being devastated by that fatal disease. The workmen, we are told, are hale and robust; and the women who live on the premises or hard by, are said to enjoy the most excellent health, and that they are remarkably prolific, giving birth to the finest and plumpest children; the cradles for which are often the carcase of a horse. A father, the proprietor of one of the establishments in Green Street, once pointed out to us his children, some of them grown up, as shewing not only the harmlessness of these trades, but, as proving the beneficial effects they produced upon the system. The workmen declare they are never ill, that they can eat anything, and drink heartily; in truth, to give credence to all they say, we should be led to believe that these were unrivalled health spots. Nevertheless, they do not pretend to deny that bad smells abound; but the speaker will assert that it is his neighbour who is the cause. The bone.boiler will point to the walls of the cat.gut maker, covered with myriads of blue.bottle flies, their backs gleaming in the sunshine, and will say, "That it is from thence arises the only source of complaint." Whilst, on the other hand, the cat.gut maker points to the thick and fetid steam rising up from the seething cauldrons of the bone.boiler, and asks, "Do you wish for farther evidence ? "My own experience, derived from repeated visits, is, that the men and women employed are as healthy as many of those employed in labours considered harmless. Dessault, a celebrated French anatomist, was wont to say, that he really believed that the tainted air of the dissecting rooms saved him from attacks of epidemic, and other diseases, of which those hospital surgeons and physicians who scarcely ever dissected a dead body, seemed to be much more susceptible than himself. Having shortly, but fairly, considered one side of the subject, let me in the same manner examine the other, in order that we may arrive as near a truthful result as our present knowledge will permit us, and thus be enabled to answer objections wisely. "When I was house surgeon at St. Louis," says Dr. Bennett, "I several times remarked, that whenever the wind was from the direction of the Montfaucon, the wounds and sores under my care assumed a foul aspect. M. Jobert, the surgeon of the hospital, has told me he has repeatedly seen hospital gangrene manifest itself in the wards apparently under the same influence. It was a fact known to all who are acquainted with St. Louis, that the above malady is more frequent at that hospital than at any other in Paris, although it is the most airy and least crowded of any. This, I think, can only be attributed to the proximity of Montfaucon." A similar result followed from a similar cause in Spitalfields from a manufactory of artificial manure, situated oposite the workhouse. Whenever the wind blew from that quarter, numerous cases of fever of a typhoid kind arose, and the diseases then prevalent took a typhoid form. 20 Parish of St. George the Martyr, Southwark. In December, 1848, when cholera was general in the neighbourhood, the proprietor was compelled to close the place, owing to a sudden and severe outbreak of diarrhoea in the workhouse. In consequence of this the occupants returned to their ordinary state of health. Five months after, the manufactory was reopened. In the course of a few days the wind again blew from the unhealthy point, and filled the workhouse with an insufferable stench. The first night forty-five boys whose dormitories faced the works, were seized with diarrhœa. The manufactory was then finally closed, and no like attacks from diarrhoea happened any more. Effluvium is lighter than common air, and consequently is carried away from its source, to fall and work its evil influences afar off. Indeed, epidemic poison may undergo some change, or be decomposed, as happens to the poison of malaria in large cities; a fact which has been observed to occur in many of the cities of the Western States of America, as also in Rome. The effluvia destroys the morbid poison. The power which these effluvia may have for evil, will be modified by the locality in which noixous trades are carried on, and by the manner they are carried on, as well as by the nature and state of the decomposing matter. The workmen employed, are those of a good sound constitution; for the delicate and ailing would never undertake such disgusting trades. Besides, they are liberally paid, and can command substantial diet. A man well fed would pass through an epidemic unhurt, whilst one ill, or imperfectly fed, would fall a helpless victim. If these works were conducted in small il-ventilated workshops, whereby the emanations become concentrated, little doubt would remain of their pernicious influence ; death under such circumstances has followed to those thus exposed, as suddenly as from a stroke of lightning. But, surely, stench is itself a nuisance, even if entirely free from harm. Air, impregnated with foul effluvia, is avoided alike by the savage and the sage ; all are akin with regard to this. And whilst granting the necessity and utility of these trades, they render life near them unpleasant. They also stand as serious obstacles in the way of improving the neighbourhood; for there no one would care to build, or if they did, would build but the lowest class houses. Such a locality is doomed to remain stationary, or, to degenerate. But there comes an end to their continuance in towns. On the 9th day of August, 1874, it will not be lawful to continue to carry on such businesses in the like situations; until then, these smells and annoyances must be borne with ; for, although they may be lessened by care and cleanliness, they cannot be entirely got rid of by any means within our knowledge. Thus time and circumstances do much for us; they help us onward in our way; but as fast as we advance, in like proportion stretches wider the horizon cf duty. The place of rest which once seemed near, keeps ever receding. We shall always have to march, and to march it may be victorious over every obstacle, yet never shall the final triumph be achieved. Always will there remain work to be done. It is however a great and good work; it seeks impartially the benefit of all; it belongs to no sect; wears no party badge; and is not limited to any class of individuals girt around by professional education and ceremony. Every mortal can do something; "the divine in his study and in the house of prayer; the general in his camp; the legislator and the magistrate in their constant ordering of the people; and the physician in his daily conversance with scenes of every kind, and intercourse with men of every class." So shall that which has been done, be but the mere earnest of that which shall be done. HENRY BATESON, M.D. April 26th, 1864. Medical Officer of Health.
