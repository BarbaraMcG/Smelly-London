CHIG II library Chigwell Urban District Council ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH including the Report of the SENIOR SANITARY INSPECTOR For the Year ending December 31st, 1947 Printed by 4. Willis, The Caxton Press, Waltham Cross CHIGWELL URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL To the Chairman and Members of the Chigwell Urban District Council Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Annual Report for the year 1947 upon the health and sanitary circumstances of the district. The outstanding event of public Health interest during the year calling for comment, was the flooding of the Metropolitan Water Board Works in the Lea Bridge Road in March, 1947, which resulted in almost the whole district being deprived of main water supply for 7 days. The measures taken to cope with the situation are described in the Senior Sanitary Inspector's section of this report. The steady growth during the year of the L.C.C. estates in Loughton and Chigwell resulted, as was foreseen, in an acute need for clinics and schools and it is unfortunate that provision for these was not made before, and not after, people had begun to be moved into their new homes. As this will be my last annual report to the Council I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the consideration and help 1 have received from the Public Health Committee and the staff of the Public Health Department during my years of office.

Population 30,170 Number of inhabited houses 8,747 Rateable value £264,417 Sum represented by a penny rate £1,084 2s. 3d. The rate in the pound for 1947/48 is 18/8d. Much progress has been made in the development of the L.C.C. Estates at Chigwell (Hainault) and Loughton and the Council's Roding Valley Estate. The Council's four temporary bungalow housing sites have been completed. The number of temporary houses provided is:- Buckhurst Hill Hornbeam Road 58 Chigwell Lechmere Avenue 28 Millers Lane 14 Loughton Oakwood Hill 100 200 The population is steadily increasing with the occupation of new houses on the L.C.C. Estates. Two new temporary schools, one at Grange Hill, Chigwell, and the other at Borders Lane, Loughton, have been completed and are in use. More schools are urgently needed to obviate overcrowding and the long journeys which some school children have to make. The development of the new light industries site at Loughton has been commenced. 3 Vital Statistics.

"Madame Pauline," 100, High Road, Loughton. These premises have been inspected and are being conducted in a satisfactory manner. 11 SECTION C Sanitary Circumstances of the Area. 1. (i) Water. The water supply for almost the whole district is derived from the Metropolitan Water Board. There are a few houses where the supply is obtained from wells. In March, 1947, the Lee Bridge Water Works of the Metropolitan Water Board were put out of commission by the bursting of reservoirs caused by thawing of the abnormal snowfall, after the cold spell which lasted for nearly three months. A similar failure of water supply due to enemy action occurred during the war when the district was without water for about a week. In this instance there was no water in the mains from 3 to 7 days according to the source, but most houses had a normal supply in 5 days. Steps were taken as follows:- All householders were circulated with warning notices telling them to economise in the use of water and to save as much as possible to flush drains. The digging of shallow trench latrines in back gardens was advocated, but so far as it is known it was not necessary to resort to this. The Metropolitan Water Board sent round a fleet of water tanks and the war time experience previously referred to gave householders some idea of their daily water requirements and of the necessity of someone being at home to collect it when delivered. A dump of water tanks was located at a Ministry of Works Depot at Waltham Abbey and arrangements were made to collect and distribute these to provide 12 water storage for farms, dairies, bakers, fishshops, hotels, restaurants, butchers and other food premises. Chlorination of all water coming through the mains was recommended for a period after the supply was again normal. (ii) Drainage and Sewerage. The sewage disposal plant at Luxborough has worked efficiently and gives a satisfactory effluent. The difficulties of sludge treatment have further increased with the steady growth of population. The scheme for enlarging these works, primarily to cope with the large L.C.C. development in the district, is in an advanced stage of preparation. It is anticipated that tenders for that part of the scheme relating to sludge treatment will be invited in 1948. The same expectation applies to the small and obsolete Millers Lane Works, which has necessarily given a very varied and often unsatisfactory quality effluent during the year. The five pumping plants (which include one at the Chigwell Gun Site to deal with hutments used for temporary housing) have functioned efficiently during the year. 2. Rivers and Streams. The River Roding is the only one passing through the centre of the district, dividing the wards of Chigwell on the south-east side and Buckhurst Hill and Loughton on the north-west side. There are no buildings at present liable to floods in the river area which is under the jurisdiction of the Roding Catchment Board. 3. (i) Closet Accommodation. A few closets on the conservancy system remain in Chigwell and Loughton wards. They are situated in remote cottages out of reach of sewers. (ii) Public Cleansing. Housing refuse was removed weekly throughout the district by the Council's own covered vehicles, with 13 paper salvage trailers attached. Three of these 10/12 cubic yard "Fordson" lorries with "Eagle" bodies are in service. Trade refuse continued to be collected on a scale of charges and has been dealt with satisfactorily. This service is used by a substantial number of traders in the district. Refuse was disposed of at a tip rented from a local contractor, who provides certain buildings, covering material and labour for levelling. The Council's own employees sort and handle salvage at this tip. Measures were taken against fly and vermin infestation. Salvage operations, directed in particular to the recovery of paper, rags and bottles, continued during the year throughout the district. The total material salvaged, sorted and disposed of was 408 tons, including 198 tons of paper. In addition 166 tons of kitchen waste were collected and conveyed to a concentrator plant at Stapleford Abbotts. Additional kitchen waste bins have been placed on the streets to cover new development, and a new "Harrier" covered lorry now makes the collection from the bins. Road gullies (in streets under the Council's control) are emptied by a mechanical suction process. The gullies are cleared three times in each year and resealea with clean water after emptying. (iii) Sanitary Inspection of the Area. An outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors is given below:- Complaints received and dealt with 788 Inspections made 6,677 Nuisances abated 317 Informal Notices served 247 Informal Notices complied with 219 Statutory Notices served 73 Statutory Notices complied with 68 Legal Proceedings 5 14 Summary of Nuisances.

These houses were fumigated with 'Thermatox' and sprayed with 'Zaldecide' with satisfactory results. Number of inspections and visits, 64. Rats and Mice Destruction Acts. There was again a rise in the number of complaints. 688 visits were made and energetic action taken to exterminate the rodents by means of gassing with 'Cymag' gas, baiting with red squill,arsenic, zinc phosphide and by trapping. There is no serious infestations, but the presence of rats and mice is still being reported from all over the district particularly where houses are situated near open spaces such as farm and forest land. 15 SECTION D Housing Statistics for the year 1947 Number of new houses erected and occupied during the year:- Permanent 86 Pre-fabricated 99 - 185 Inspection of Dwelling Houses during the Year: 1.

The number of farms producing grade and ungraded milk is: Tuberculin Tested 2; Accredited 8; Ordinary 3; total 13. The cowsheds have been kept in a satisfactory condition during the year and 117 visits have been made. 27 samples of milk were taken for bacteriological examination by the County Council, Public Health Department and 5 of these were reported as being unsatisfactory. 39 samples of milk were taken by the Weights and Measures Department of the County Council during the year and one of these was reported to contain 6% added water. On 3 occasions samples of milk were taken by the Public Health Department of this Authority and all were reported upon as genuine. There are 7 dairies and milkshops registered. 46 visits to these premises were made. There are 10 registered retail purveyors of milk. (b) Meat and other Foods. There are 7 slaughterhouses in the district all licensed under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938.

Cloves, ground: 20¼ lbs. Black pepper, ground: 136 lb. In the district there are 11 bakehouses; 110 visits have been made to these premises. (c) Factories. 50 visits were made. The process of cellulose paint spraying at two factories in the district has given rise to repeated complaints from surrounding householders on account of fumes produced under certain atmospheric conditions. In the case of one of these factories an inspector of Alkali and Works suggested that the installation of a catch of the active carbon type might prove effective in reducing the fumes, but hitherto it has not been found possible to obtain suitable apparatus for a factory operating on a small scale. Smoke. The emission of smoke from the burning of wood shavings by a firm of builders and contractors gave rise to complaints, but the nuisance has been largely controlled by changes in the method of stoking and times of operating the incinerator. 22 23 1.

Senior Sanitary Inspector. 27 SECTION F Prevalence of, and Control over, Infectious and other Diseases The anticipated biennial epidemic of measles occurred in the first 6 months of the year, reached its peak in the second quarter and then rapidly subsided. As so often happens, there was an outbreak of whooping cough at the same time, the bulk of the cases occurring in the second and third quarters of the year. Diphtheria. Two cases of diphtheria were notified, both adults, and the diagnosis in one of these was not confirmed after admission to hospital. Diphtheria Immunisation. The arrangements as to clinics remained unchanged. The increase in the number of children treated was due largely to the growing population of the new estates. The following table shows the number of children immunised during the past 5 years:— 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 408 401 445 371 514 415 treated at clinics. 99 treated by private practitioners. In addition, 326 children previously immunised were given a re-inforcing dose on starting school. Poliomyelitis. That three cases only of poliomyelitis should have occurred, with one death, must be regarded as extremely fortunate when the experience of surrounding districts 28 is considered and the ample opportunities that existed of children in the district being exposed to carriers and mild abortive cases of the disease in other areas. Scabies. There was a welcome decrease in the incidence of scabies, 34 notifications compared with 78 in the previous year. The facilities for treatment in Loughton and Buckhurst Hill remained unchanged. Food Poisoning. A notable outbreak of food poisoning occurred in June at a wedding feast at a farm in the district. When visited at about 6 p.m., some 30 out of approximately 100 guests were found in varying degrees of prostration from gastro-intestinal symptoms. A large variety of samples of food consumed by the guests was taken for bacteriological analysis, but no pathogenic germ was found in any of them. Unfortunately (it was a hot day) all the ice cream had been consumed and its container removed, before the arrival of the Medical Officer of Health and it is possible that this was the food at fault. Subsequent examination of one of the patients made it probable that the outbreak was caused by a toxin producing germ responsible for many such outbreaks. The germ rapidly multiplies in certain foodstuffs and its poisons produce symptoms with great rapidity in those consuming the contaminated food. Two of the sufferers were ill enough to be removed to hospital but rapidly recovered. 29 Summary of Cases of Infectious Diseases notified, showing number of Cases, Admissions to Hospital and Deaths.

When it is remembered that the new estates are far from completion these figures give a measure of the increasing pressure on the County Tuberculosis service with the evergrowing demand for more sanatorium beds, X-ray facilities and dispensary accommodation. There were 8 deaths only from tuberculosis compared with 10 in 1946. 30 Age Period New Cases Deaths Respiratory Nonrespiratory Respiratory Nonrespiratory M. F. M. F. M. F. M. F.
