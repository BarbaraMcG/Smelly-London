Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present the Annual Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District for the year 1960. The vital statistics for 1960 show the usual annual variations and again compare favourably with the statistics for the county and for the country as a whole. The Birth Rate of 17.2 is the highest recorded in the district during the last ten years and at the same time the Infant Mortality Rate fell by 6.6 to 18.2 compared with a figure of 21.7 for England and Wales. These figures taken together with the fact that once again there were no maternal deaths must indicate the benefits of good ante.natal care which is available to every woman under the National Health Service. However, on the debit side there was an increase in the Still Birth Rate at 18.9 which although below the national figure of 19.7 indicates that continued efforts in perfecting and also in maintaining the present high standard of antenatal care are still needed. The majority of infant deaths still occur during the first week of life with congenital abnormalities as the main cause. Obviously some agent be it virus or drug has so damaged the foetus in utero that it was not possible to maintain life for very long after birth. It is to be hoped that medical research will be able to throw some more light on this important subject and so enable us to raise the standard of preventive care even higher. The Death Rate fell to 11.5 which compares with a similar rate for England and Wales. Fifty per cent of the deaths registered in the district were of people over 70 years of age. It is pleasing to report a relatively good year in the district in respect of infectious diseases. This was marred only by a slight increase in the number of cases of whooping cough and dysentery indicating the need for continued efforts in immunisation and careful personal hygiene respectively. 3 The upward trend in the population and number of inhabited houses continued in 1959. As a result of Council and private building many more people are now enjoying the amenities of new houses and in addition people in old but sound houses are now making use of the standard improvement grants to provide themselves with bath, wash. hand basin, hot water supply and decent food store. These amenities are not now considered as luxuries but as necessities to good healthy living. People are becoming much more conscious of the importance of these minimum health standards and this awareness must reflect in no small way in improving the general state of the health of the district. Unfortunately some, even though provided with all the appropriate amenities to preserve a good standard of health, tend to let disease prevail by persisting in slovenly personal habits and hygiene. Man is a .lazy animal. at heart and many bad habits still persist. These habits do have a bearing in the spread of disease and could so easily be remedied if only a little more thought and effort was expended by the public in general. Once again I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their interest and support and also acknowledge with thanks the friendly co.operation of my colleagues in the other departments of the Council. Finally to Mr. F. V. Bell, the Chief Public Health Inspector, and all members of the Department, my sincere thanks for their most willing and able assistance during the year. I am. Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, W. CORMACK, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTICS FOR THE AREA Area and Acreage (Bedfont, Feltham and Hanworth) 4,925 acres Population 52,290 Number of inhabited dwellings 14,758 Number of new dwellings erected 412 The product of a penny rate £4,289 The rateable value £1,107,402 VITAL STATISTICS LIVE BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 888 452 436 Illegitimate 48 26 22 Total 936 478 458 Live Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated home population 17.9 Adjusted Live Birth Rate 17.2 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 5.1 STILL BIRTHS Total Male Female Legitimate 18 8 10 Illegitimate — — — Total 18 8 10 Still Birth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 18.9 Total Live and Still Births 954 INFANT DEATHS (under I year of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 15 9 6 Illegitimate 2 1 1 Total 17 10 7 Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 18.2 Legitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 legitimate live births 16.89 Illegitimate Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 illegitimate live births 41.7 NEO.NATAL DEATHS (under four weeks of age) Total Male Female Legitimate 11 7 4 Illegitimate 1 — 1 Total 12 7 5 Neo.Natal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births 12.8 Early Neo.Natal Mortality Rate (first week) per 1,000 live births 12.8 Perinatal Mortality Rate per 1,000 live and still births 31.1 Maternal Deaths (including abortion) nil Maternal Mortality Rate per 1,000 total live and still births nil 5 DEATHS Male 202 Female 177 Total 379 Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated home population— Crude Death Rate 7.2 Comparability Factor 1.59 Adjusted Death Rate 11.5 Death Rate from pulmonary tuberculosis 0.03 Death Rate from Cancer 1.6 Birth and Death Rates for England and Wales, 1960 Birth Rate 171 Still Birth Rate (per 1,000 live and still births) 19.7 Death Rate 11.5 Deaths under one year of age 217 Deaths under four weeks of age 15.6 Maternal causes, excluding abortion 031 Due to abortion 0.08 Total maternal mortality 0.39 Table of Birth and Death Rates for previous 10 years * * † † ‡ Rirth Rate Death Rate Still Birth Maternal Infant Death Rate Under Under Year Crude Adjusted Crude Adjusted Rate Deaths 1yr. 4 wks. 1959 15.6 15.0 8.6 13.5 11.05 nil 24.8 19.9 1958 16.6 16.1 7.4 11.7 10.55 nil 21.32 16.58 1957 16.3 15.81 7.0 11.13 23.95 nil 19.63 15.95 1956 16.7 1619 6.6 10.5 14.38 nil 21.89 18.24 1955 16.0 15.84 7.1 10.5 13.87 nil 15.34 7.67 1954 15.76 15.60 5.87 8.68 15.54 1.29 17.10 13.15 1953 16.41 16.24 7.49 11.08 15.28 2.54 24.57 18.11 1952 16.98 16.47 6.22 8.77 18.61 nil 20.22 13.9 1951 15.76 15.28 7.03 9.91 15.19 nil 18.23 11.22 1950 15.52 15.05 7.11 10.02 20.20 1.43 25.03 — * Rate per 1,000 estimated home population. †ate per 1,000 total births. ‡Rate per 1,000 live births.

It is interesting to note that two of the new cases were in the over sixty-five years group. One wonders how often this type of case may be the unwitting source of infection to others. The old person with the chronic cough, never at any time very willing to seek medical advice, could be a case of chronic tuberculosis. Through the years the disease process and the body resistance have reached a stage where there is no advancement one way or the other i.e. the person lives more or less in a state of symbiosis with the disease. Unfortunately this type is very often sputum positive and thus a dangerous source of infection. Persuasive measures to try and get more elderly people to attend for Chest X-Ray seems to be the only way of combating this problem. 8 Diphtheria No cases occurred in the district during the year and as before immunisation against the disease was available at the Middlesex County Council Clinics in the area. This, together with the facilities available through the General Practitioners, served to keep the number of protected children at a high level. Immunisation in infancy is not enough and parents should ensure that their children receive their re-inforcing innoculations on entry to school at the age of five years and again between ten and eleven years. Whooping Cough Fifty-eight cases were notified during the year and of these, five were admitted to hospital. All children should be protected against this disease and immunisation with the new Triple Vaccine giving protection against Diphtheria and Tetanus at the same time should be a "must" in every baby's welfare programme today. Acute Poliomyelitis No cases occurred during the year. Response to the immunisation campaign against this disease has been good especially in children but one would like to see all the children protected. It is regrettable that some people will only think about having protective innoculations when a case actually occurs in their neighbourhood. This could be too late ! Three injections are required at present with the possibility of a fourth at a later date. Unfortunately some people, especially in the teenaged group, have defaulted before completing their primary course and are thus still vulnerable. This is a difficult problem to solve as nowadays teenagers would appear to be a law unto themselves, eager to have their own way and at the same time paying scant attention to parental wishes. Food Poisoning Notifications of cases of food poisoning were down compared with 1959 and it is hoped that this improvement will be maintained. Dysentery Fourty-four cases of dysentery occurred during the year being a slight increase as compared with the previous year. As I have commented before, control of this disease lies 9 mainly in the hands of the public themselves. Simple routine hygiene measures are all that are required but yet seem so difficult to obtain. Maternal Mortality There were no maternal deaths during the year. National Assistance Act, 1948—Section 47 It was not found necessary to take action under the National Assistance Act in respect of persons requiring care and attention. In certain cases arrangements were made with the Area Medical Officer for the assistance of Home Helps. Housing Since house building recommenced in 1946 this Authority has built 2,449 dwellings and 1,646 private dwellings have been erected. There was still a demand for houses, mostly from young couples who were sharing accommodation with parents. Maternity and Child Welfare and School Health Services This district forms part of Health Area 10, Middlesex County Council, who provide numerous sessions for antenatal and post-natal care, child welfare, immunisation and school health services at the following clinics:— Cardinal Road, Feltham. Grove Crescent, Hanworth. Imperial Road, Bedfont. Establishments for Massage and Special Treatment One establishment was licensed under Sections 355—357 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. Medical Examination of Council Employees The total number of medical interviews and examinations carried out during the year was seventy-seven. These consisted of thirty-one for fitness for admission to the Council's Sick Pay Scheme, twenty-one for Superannuation purposes and twenty-five for various special purposes such as aged employees' fitness to continue working. It is interesting to report how fit some of these elderly employees are and also how much pleasure they seem to take in doing a good days work. Sewerage The public sewers discharge to the West Middlesex Main Drainage deep sewers and the sewage is conveyed to and treated at the Mogden Works, Isleworth. 10 The vast majority of premises in the area are drained to the public sewers, but there remain a few served by cesspools or pail closets. A scheme is being prepared to provide main drainage for a number of these. Water Analysis The Bedfont and Feltham Wards of the District were supplied by the South-West Suburban Water Company and the Hanworth Ward by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water supplied to this area by the South-West Suburban Water Company was taken by the Company from the Metropolitan Water Board. The water was derived from the River Thames, purified in the storage reservoirs at Littleton, Staines, and Walton, and filtered and chlorinated at the Hampton Works. The water supply was satisfactory both as regards quantity and quality. Samples for bacteriological and chemical examination were taken by the Metropolitan Water Board at all stages of purification at least 5 times each week and 13 raw water and 247 treated water samples were taken by the South-West Suburban Water Company including 14 in the Feltham area. In addition 2 samples were taken by my department.

The water supplied had no plumbo-solvent action but samples were tested for presence of metals. No action was required in respect of contamination of the water. All water was chlorinated before distribution and all new and repaired mains were chlorinated before being restored to use. With the exception of two condemned but occupied cottages all the houses in the area were supplied from the public water mains. 12 CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH INSPECTOR'S REPORT Housing—Demolition and Closure The clearance of unfit houses continued in accordance with the Council's programme and it was possible to make better progress than in 1959 as will be seen from the figures given below. Good progress was made with the rehousing of the occupants of the Fern Grove clearance area and with the demolition of the houses. Towards the end of the year the Council accepted a recommendation that thirty-five houses in the Sydney Road area should be dealt with as a clearance area, but deferred action. Action upon a further twenty-two houses in Railway Terrace was also deferred. Appeals were lodged by an owner against demolition orders made in respect of ten houses. The orders were confirmed, but their operation suspended for eight months to give the owner a further opportunity of carrying out works which had been the subject of an agreement. Six of the orders subsequently became operative. From 1946 until the end of 1960 two hundred and eighty two houses have been dealt with as follows:— Demolition Orders made 248 Agreements entered into with owners to "close" or repair or Closing Orders made 34 Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal action including those in clearance area 234 Persons who have been displaced 783 Action taken during 1960 is as follows:— Houses reported to Public Health Committee as being unfit 60 Demolition Orders made 38 Closing Orders made — Houses demolished as a result of formal or informal procedure under Section 17 (1) 13 Houses in clearance area demolished 15 Houses closed under Sections 16 (4), 17 (1) and 35 (1) 1 Houses closed under Sections 17 (3) and 26 — Parts of buildings closed under Section 18 — Houses in respect of which agreements entered into with owners to repair — Total number of persons displaced 112 13 Housing Repairs House-to-House inspections were continued and notices served where necessary to remedy defects. Quite a fair proportion of the older houses visited were found to be owner-occupied. In such cases inspections were not made. Appeals lodged in 1959 against formal notices served under the Housing Act, 1957 were heard early in the year. The appellants did not proceed with their contention that the premises were unfit but contested as unreasonable and excessive the Council's requirements in connection with dampness and pointing of brickwork. Both sides agreeing, the Judge appointed a referee to report on certain items and subsequently made an Order adopting the report and requiring the works to be completed in six months. An appeal against a similar notice by another owner was subsequently withdrawn. Informal Action Number of unfit or defective houses rendered fit during the period as a result of informal action by the local Authority 66 Action under Statutory Powers Number of houses reported to Public Health Committee with a view to service of formal notices 7 Number of formal notices served 7 Public Health Acts Number of houses in which defects were remedied after service of formal notices:— (a) by owners — (b) by local authority in default of owners — Housing Act, 1957 Number of houses made fit after service of formal notices (Sections 9 and 16):— (a) by owners 8 (b) by local authority in default of owners— Notices Served and Repairs or Improvements Effected.

The standard amenities are (a) a fixed bath or shower in a bathroom; (b) a wash-hand basin; (c) a hot water supply; (d) a water closet in or contiguous to the dwelling; and (e) satisfactory facilities for storing food. Fifty-six applications were received and forty-eight had been approved by the end of the year. The majority of the applications were from owner/occupiers and only a very small number from landlords. This is a pity. Repairs carried out under the Housing Act do not of themselves make an older house satisfactory, even if fit for human habitation and most tenants desire to have additional amenities. The standard improvement grants do offer a means of providing these amenities at a minimum cost and one would have thought that more landlords would have found them sufficiently attractive. 14 15 Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair Applications for Certificates of Disrepair and for the cancellation thereof were received and dealt with as set out below. No. of applications for certificates 7 No. of decisions not to issue certificates 4 No. of certificates issued 3 No. of undertakings given by landlords to remedy defects 4 No. of undertakings refused by local authority No. of applications for cancellation of certificates 8 No. of certificates cancelled 7 Overcrowding Three cases of overcrowding were found and reported to the Public Health Committee. Six known cases of overcrowding were abated during the year. Moveable Dwellings Public Health control of moveable dwellings in the area has in the past been effected by means of the Middlesex County Council Acts, 1944—1956 and by byelaws. Under these Acts the consent of the Council is required to the placing or keeping of any moveable dwelling used or intended to be used as the sole or principal means of habitation for more than three months in any year. It has been the Council's policy for many years to deter the use of caravans in the area as permanent dwellings and during the year, in three cases, consent was not given. Action was taken which secured the removal of fortytwo other moveable dwellings and the cessation of use of five caravans in respect of the use of which no consents had been given. The Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act, 1960 came into operation on the 29th August. This is largely a town planning measure and so far as the control of caravans is concerned supersedes the general public health control. It was considered expedient for caravans to be dealt with in future as a planning matter rather than that two departments should be involved. Food Premises Regular inspections of all types of food premises were continued, more particular attention being given to premises where food was prepared. 16 Despite all efforts there are still too many people in the food trades who are careless or apathetic in their attitude towards food handling and this I am afraid applies also to many members of the public, or seems to. Disapproval by the public of unsatisfactory practices should be more vocal. Proceedings were taken against the proprietor of a bakery in respect of rodent excreta found in a loaf. The Magistrates imposed a fine of £25 and costs for selling food unfit for human consumption. Shops All shops were regularly inspected, the department administering the whole of the provisions of the Shops Act, 1950, the frequency of inspection depending upon the class of business carried on. Two licences were renewed to keep pet shops. The occupiers of three shops were licensed to deal in game. The 'late day' for the general closing hours of shops in the area was Friday, but shopkeepers remained free to fix their own half-day closing, subject to the provisions of the Shops Act. Most shops closed for the half-day on Wednesdays. There was no evidence of shops remaining open after the closing hours. A number of shops opened on Sundays and inspections were made in connection with the limited range of articles permitted to be sold on that day, but it appeared that generally the requirements of the Act were being observed. Food premises in the district consist of the following:— Catering establishments, including factory canteens and school kitchens ... ... ... 126 Grocery and provision shops and "general stores" 76 Greengrocers' shops 40 Butchers' shops28 Bakers' shops 16 Milk shops 16 Fishmongers'shops 12 Sweet confectionery shops 55 Food Preparing Premises There were no new registrations during the year. The register contained the addresses of thirty-five premises registered under the Act for the preservation, etc., of food as follows:— Premises used for the manufacture of sausages, pies, etc 14 17 Premises used for the cooking of fish 12 Premises used for the cooking of bacon 9 Hawkers of Foodstuffs Under the provisions of Section 11 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1950 persons selling foodstuffs from any vehicle etc., who are not the occupiers of open shops for the sale of foodstuffs, are required to be registered with the local authority and any foodstores at which the foodstuffs intended for sale are stored are also required to be registered. There is no requirement that hawkers shall have a food store, it is felt that this leaves a loophole and that foodstuffs may be stored at times under unsatisfactory conditions. Public Health Control over hawkers' activities is less exacting than for foodshops and is more difficult of application but efforts were made to maintain a reasonable hygienic standard. Three new hawkers of foodstuffs were registered. Street Traders Persons wishing to trade from fixed sites in any public street are required to hold a licence under Sections 320 and 321 of the Middlesex County Council Act, 1944. The Licence, to sell fruit and vegetables, of the one street trader in the district, was renewed. No other applications were received. Slaughter-houses The three slaughter-houses previously licensed went out of use and the licences were not renewed. Six slaughtermen renewed their licences to slaughter. In February the Council submitted to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a report upon slaughterhouse facilities, in accordance with the Slaughter-houses Act, 1958, and the Slaughter-house (Reports) Direction, 1959. This report was accepted by the Minister. Subsequently the Minister made the Slaughter-houses (Hygiene) Regulations (Appointed Day—No. 2) Order, 1960, and The Slaughter of Animals (Prevention of Cruelty) Regulations (Appointed Day—No. 2) Order, 1960, appointing the 1st October 1960 as the date from which certain of the principal regulations were to come into force for existing slaughter-houses in the district. Knackers Yard The licence of the one Knackers Yard was not renewed and the premises are to be redeveloped for other purposes. 18 Inspection and Supervision of Food Carcase meat and offal was inspected at butchers' shops, catering establishments and elsewhere, including three pigs slaughtered by a pig breeder and the following was considered unfit for human consumption:— Beasts Calves Sheep Pigs Tuberculosis Other condition 1874 lbs. 84 lbs. 217 lbs. 454 lbs. In addition, the following amounts of other foodstuffs were found to be unfit for human consumption:— Fish 42 lbs. Chicken 361 lbs. Sausages 38 lbs. Ham 66 lbs. Bacon 3 lbs. Biscuits lbs. Rabbits 30 Saveloys 42 Faggots 54 Dripping 144 lbs. Meat Pies 20 lbs. Tinned Foodstuffs Meat 518 lbs. Fruit 241 lbs. Fish 4 lbs. Vegetables 19 lbs. Milk 12 tins Ham 35 lbs. Soup 3 tins Rice Pudding 2 tins Disposal of Condemned Food Where possible condemned foodstuffs were sent to a waste products factory, where they were processed for nonedible purposes. Foodstuffs which were not suitable for such disposal were buried at the Council's refuse tip. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Food and Drugs Authority The Middlesex County Council is the Food and Drugs Authority for the District and I am indebted to the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department, for details of action taken in this district. Samples procured:— Article Total samples procured Jnsatisfactory Milk (New) 56 1 Milk (Various) 28 1 Butter and Margarine 5 — Cakes 3 — Cream 10 — 19 Drugs 8 — Fish and Fish Products 10 — Fruit — Fresh and Canned 13 — Ice Cream 6 — Meat and Meat Products and liver 26 — Soft Drinks 4 — Sweets 4 — Vinegar 18 — Wine, Spirits and Ale 5 — Miscellaneous 13 — Total 209 2 Milk. One sample of a number taken from a large consignment was found to be deficient in butter-fat and to contain a small amount of added water. The average butter fat content over the whole consignment was satisfactory and subsequent sampling showed no added water. Broken glass was found in a bottle with a damaged top at a school. It was impossible to prove whether the bottle was broken before or after delivery, and no further action was taken. The majority of the inspection work carried out under the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Acts, 1887—1953 relates to ensuring that the requirements of the various Marking Orders made under the provisions of the Act of 1926 are complied with. These Orders apply to the marking of the country of origin on imported foodstuffs, principally meat, apples, tomatoes, dried fruits, bacon, ham, poultry, butter and honey, upon sale and exposure for sale. The inspections were made at 140 premises of 593 displays of these foodstuffs. All of the infringements detected were of a minor nature and were dealt with by verbal warnings. The Labelling of Food Order, 1953, requires pre-packed food to be marked with the name and address, or with the registered trade mark, of the packer or labeller. It also requires such food to be labelled with its common or usual name (if any), and in the case of a compounded food, with the names of the ingredients in descending order of proportion by weight. It also controls the manner in which the presence of vitamins and minerals is disclosed and prescribes specific labelling of certain foods. A total of 744 articles of prepacked food was examined in 84 different premises to ascertain whether there was compliance with the above order. Food advertisements and labels have been scrutinised for false and misleading statements and descriptions. No serious infringements were disclosed. Corrective action taken within the whole area or the County has equal effect within 20 the sub-districts and work under this heading is combined with inspections made in connection with the Merchandise Marks Acts and the Labelling of Food Order. Corrective action was sought, for example, where oranges, grapefruit and tangerines were described as seedless but found to contain seeds, cream doughnuts and jam cream sponge which contained imitation cream, and meat and fruit which bore false statements of origin. During 1960, 45 samples of designated milks were taken, none of which failed to obtain a satisfactory certificate. One Dealer's (Pasteuriser's) Licence in respect of premises within the Feltham area where milk is processed was issued. The premises were regularly inspected and compliance with statutory requirements was well maintained. No infringements were reported during the year. In addition to the foregoing, eight samples of raw milk were procured within the Feltham district and submitted to test for the presence of tubercle bacilli; none was found contaminated. Milk (Special Designations), (Raw Milk), (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954 Dealers licences were granted to sell graded milks as follows:— Tuberculin Tested 9 Pasteurised 9 Sterilised 16 Supplementary Licences: Tuberculin Tested 13 Pasteurised 13 Sterilised 14 Two new distributors were registered and at the end of the year the register contained details of twenty-six distributors of milk and one dairy. The Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960, came into operation on the 1st October, 1960. These regulations which replace, consolidate and amend the former regulations place the duty to issue dealers licences upon the food and drugs authority, which for this area is the Middlesex County Council. Complaints were received in respect of three milk bottles which either contained foreign matter or were not clean. Warnings were given in each case. Ice Cream Premises at which ice cream was sold continued to receive regular attention. There were no registered manufacturers of ice cream in this area. 21 Two premises were registered, under Section 16 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, for the sale of ice cream and at the end of the year the register contained details of thirty premises. In the past noise and disturbance from loudspeakers etc., used by mobile ice cream vendors has been a cause of annoyance to some residents. The Noise Abatement Act, 1960, which came into operation on the 27th November, 1960, restricts the use of such instruments and the Council successfully prosecuted a number of offenders under the Middlesex County Council Byelaws for the Good Rule and Government of the County. Clean Air In order to carry out the programme for the establishment of smoke control areas the Council decided to augment the staff of the department and in June a smoke control assistant was appointed. A detailed survey of the proposed first area was proceeded with immediately and in November the Feltham Urban District (No. 1) Smoke Control Order was made and submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. Pollution of the atmosphere by smoke from dieselengined vehicles continued unabated, indeed it appeared to be increasing. The existing methods of "control" are not effective, although it would be fair to say that in all probability, they were not designed to deal with atmospheric pollution as such. An amendment of the law, either with regard to road vehicles or clean air seems desirable. Noise Abatement The Noise Abatement Act, 1960 came into operation on the 27th November, 1960. It provides that noise or vibration which is a nuisance shall be a statutory nuisance for the purposes of the Public Health Act, 1936 and restricts the operation on highways etc. of loudspeakers. The use of loudspeakers by vendors of certain foodstuffs, for example, ice cream, is permitted, subject to conditions, between the hours of noon and seven o'clock in the evening. Rodent Control The control of rat and mice infestations in accordance with the methods advocated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was continued. The Council's refuse tip was kept under regular observation and any sign of rat 22 activity dealt with immediately. It was not considered necessary to test bait the public sewers. Complaints received of infestations numbered 146 and these, together with cases discovered by members of the staff, involved the inspection of 1271 premises. Rat infestations were found at 201 premises and mice infestations at 43 premises. 222 treatments were undertaken by the department, a further eight being carried out by the occupiers. For treatments carried out by this departmen) on behalf of occupiers, a standard charge of five shillings was made in the case of private dwellings and the full cost of treatment was recovered in the case of business premises. In certain cases of hardship the standard charge was waived. Where the occupiers elected to carry out the treatment themselves, advice and supervision was given to ensure that the treatment was effective. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 Three premises were registered under this Act at the beginning of the year. Three inspections were made. Very little filling material was used at any of them and early in the year one closed down. Disinfestation Two dwellings (one Council owned and one private) were treated for bed bugs, contact insecticides being used. Apart from one of the cases mentioned above, it was not found necessary to disinfest for bed bugs, the furniture etc., of persons rehoused in the Council's dwellings. Other disinfestations for the eradication of pests were carried out as follows:— Wasps 59 Cockroaches 3 Flies 2 Ants 1 Infectious Disease—Disinfection It was not found necessary to carry out disinfection after infectious disease.
