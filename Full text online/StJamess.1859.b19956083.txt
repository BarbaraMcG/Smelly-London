JOHN CLEMENTS, RICHARD ATTENBOROUGII, Auditors. JOHN BENNETT, General Report of Works EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY OF ST. JAMES'S, WESTMINSTER, IN THE YEAR 1859-60. To the Vestry of St. James's, Westminster. 24th June, 1860. Gentlemen, The List of actual Works executed by the Vestry under my superintendence, is, I am happy to say, a very short one for the twelve months included in the annexed list. The Paving Works being comparatively nothing, the workmen employed by the Vestry have been almost entirely engaged in making good the various Roadways and Footways, where they had been from any circumstances disturbed, or had become defective;— as usual, the greatest separate amount has been expended in Regent Street, but that sum is a wonderfully small one considering the vast area of carriageway to be maintained, and, including as it does, £.220 paid for a large Iron Roller; there should also, strictly speaking, be a sum of about £.60 deducted from that item, being money that has been refunded on account of Gas and Water Trenches. In the early part of last summer experiments were made xii with Bray's Traction Engine, as to its capabilities and advantages for drawing the large roller; the result of such experiments proved beyond doubt that the engine might have been very advantageously used if terms could have been made, but the roller was not subsequently required frequently enough to warrant the Committee in recommending the Vestry to make any arrangement with the Traction Engine Company. The other Paving Works executed by the Vestry for the twelve months have been a multitude of small repairs, and making good where the surface Paving has been in any way disturbed; but, on the whole, the amount performed has been less than in previous years. The Works in connection with Sewers have not been so heavy either. The annexed list shews the principal, if not the only, Works performed by the Vestry during the twelve months; the remainder consist principally of cleansing and very small repairs to gullies: the time of the flushers (the men employed by the Vestry) has been devoted to cleansing Sewers, removing all obstructions, both in the Sewers and mouths of Drains and Gullies, and generally investigating complaints that can only be arrived at from underground inspection. One new Urinal has been erected by the Vestry, in place of one removed in Vine Street; this Urinal contains accommodation for five, and is, in fact, the remaining half of the erection originally fixed in the xiii Haymarket. The other public conveniencies in the parish have of course required attention, and have been regularly cleansed, but nothing in the shape of repair, beyond cleansing holes in pipes, &c., has been done. Two new Lamps only have been erected by the Vestry—one which was displaced by the Guards' Memorial, has been re-fixed in the centre of Waterloo Place, exactly opposite its previous site, and a curbed footway and posts placed round it; the other in Berwick Street, at the corner of Portland Street; that lamp being also in the place of one removed (the house to which it was fixed having been pulled down some years previously,) and which had not been re-fixed. The new Seats and alterations in the Vestry Room appear to be the only addition to the List of Works executed under my superintendence. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, A.

JAMES’S, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE YEAR 1859. TO THE VESTRY OF The Parish of St. fames, Westminster. Reverend Sir, My Lord, and Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you the Tables of the mortality in the Parish of St. James, Westminster, during the last year, and also a report of the sanitary work done during the same period. The remarks I have to make on these documents will not be so extended on the present occasion as in past years, as neither the death of the year nor the sanitary arrangements present any remarkable departure from the same records to which I have had to draw your attention in previous years. The only remarkable exception has been the occurrence of small pox in the parish, which, as part of a great epidemic in London, has led to more decided action in regard to measures for the arrest of the progress of this disease. The first point to which I would direct your attention, is the number of deaths in the year 1859. According to the subjoined Tables, you will find this is 764. This is a higher number than the average deaths of the last four years; but it is considerably below the average of the previous four years, and below the average of the death in the parish for the last fifteen years. The increase in 4 the mortality of the year has occurred amongst young persons, between the ages of 1 and 20 years, as will be seen from the following Tables of deaths at different ages:— 1857. First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total. Under 1 year . 50 52 73 50 225 „ 5 „ 31 28 32 23 114 „ 20 „ 16 5 4 8 33 „ 40 „ 17 17 24 28 80 „ 60 „ 37 23 10 41 117 „ 80 „ 30 31 30 39 130 Upwards 1 10 3 5 19 182 106 182 194 724 1858.

The zymotic diseases of the year, distributed over the three districts of the parish, are as follows:— Names of Disease. St. James's Square. Golden Square. Brewer Street. Total. Small pox 1 1 2 4 Measles 4 16 18 38 Scarlet Fever & Diphtheria 5 16 10 31 Hooping Cough 5 8 9 22 Diarrhœa 6 8 6 20 Typhus 1 3 2 6 Total 22 52 47 121 The time of the year at which this mortality has occurred will be seen by the Table now presented. Name of Disease. First Quarter. Second Quarter. Third Quarter. Fourth Quarter. Total. Small Pox 1 2 1 4 Measles 7 15 14 1 37 Scarlet Fever 12 6 6 8 32 Hooping Cough 2 15 1 4 22 Diarrœa 1 •• 13 6 20 Typhus 1 3 •• 2 6 Total 23 40 36 22 121 From this Table we see that these diseases are some of them amenable to temperature. Thus, 6 diarrhoea carries off but 1 victim in the winter and spring quarters, but takes 13 in the summer, and 6 in the autumn quarter. Hooping cough has its least fatal period during the hot summer months, and its greatest harvest during the changeable weather of spring. Scarlet fever carries off more victims in the autumn and winter quarters than in the spring and summer, whilst the spring and summer are most favourable to measles. Altogether, the spring and the summer quarters are most favourable to zymotic disease; 76 deaths occur in these two quarters against 45 in the autumn and winter. This is confirmatory of the view that the animal poisons which produce contagious disease require, like animal and vegetable germs, a certain amount of temperature to render them active. The increase in the number of zymotic diseases during the past year has been principally in small pox, measles, hooping cough, and diarrhoea. With the exception of measles and hooping cough the same increase has been observed throughout the whole Metropolis. whole Metropolis. This will be seen from the following extract from the Registrar-General's Reports for 1858 and 1859. Small Pox. Measles. Scarlet Fever. Hooping Cough. Diarrhœa. Typhus. 1858 247 2383 4118 2700 2093 1902 1859 1156 1305 4197 1741 3335 1796 Although not the most striking from the number of its victims, the most alarming of these forms of 7 disease was small pox. The number of persons that died in the parish was four, but many who were attacked were conveyed to the Small Pox Hospital, and died there. Even with this addition, the number who died would not have made the presence of this disease so alarming, but that it was known to be spreading throughout the Metropolis, and week after week that unerring interpreter of the presence of disease, the Registrar-General's Weekly Report of the Mortality of the Metropolis, brought to light the fact, that the countrymen of Jenner had neglected the great discovery which he had bequeathed, and were paying the penalty by hundreds of deaths and thousands of cases of disgusting disease. Although this disease was working its way in 1858, and straggling cases, without any death, occurred amongst us in that year, it was not till May 1859, that a fatal case occurred. This happened in Berwick Street. I immediately made inquiries in the immediate neighbourhood, and found that all the children in that and the neighbouring houses were vaccinated. I found, however, on making inquiries of the public Vaccinators and Registrars, that their returns did not afford evidence that half the children that were born in the parish were vaccinated, and suggested that means should be taken to ascertain whether all who were born in the parish were vaccinated. I also directed the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Morgan, to make inquiries, in order to ascertain whether the children of families living in the vicinity of houses where small pox had 8 broken out were vaccinated. This was carried out, and in the month of September I reported that "50 children had been sent by the Inspector to "the public Vaccinators." At this time, a case of small pox occurred at Ingestre Buildings, and 17 children were found in those lodging rooms who had not been vaccinated. The following extracts from my fortnightly reports to the Vestry will shew how anxiously this disease has been watched, and, in some measure, the success that has attended our efforts:— "October 20th, 1859.—No death has occurred "from small pox during the past fortnight; but "one case has been sent to the Small Pox Hospital "from Little Windmill Street. The disease is on "the increase in the Metropolis ; and unless active "measures arc taken for the vaccination of persons "who have not had the cow pox, its ravages may "be expected to increase. The inspector has con"tinued his inquiries among families in the vicinity "of the small-pox cases, and up to this time has "discovered 70 children unvaccinated. The Board "of Guardians of the Poor have, I understand, "issued some placards on the subject. It would, "I think, bo desirable that this subject should be "referred to the Sanitary Committee, so that united "action may take place on this very important "matter, and thus the evils of a divided respon"sibility be as much as possible avoided. I have "called on the two public Vaccinators, and requested "them to furnish me with the names of children 9 "or persons who have been unsuccessfully "nated, so that they may be watched till vacci- "nation is successful. In order to meet the "prejudices of those who object to having their "children vaccinated, I have supplied the Inspector "and Vaccinators with a pamphlet on the subject, "written by Dr. Ballard, Medical Officer of Health "of St. Mary's, Islington; for this purpose I "should be glad if the Vestry would allow me to "purchase a further quantity of these tracts for "distribution. I should also be glad if they would "give an order for the purchase of Condy's Disin- "fecting Fluid, as, in many cases, where this agent "is of great service, persons are too poor to make "the purchase of it themselves." " November 3rd, 1859.—I have made every effort "to arrest the progress of small pox; and wherever "cases have broken out, the Inspector has been "directed to make inquiries of the surrounding "families with regard to vaccination. Up to the "present time 124 children have been discovered "unvaccinated; and of these we have obtained "evidence that 57 are now vaccinated. In many "instances, however, the vaccination has been too "late to stay the plague. A woman and four "children were found unvaccinated at 28, Little "Windmill Street. They were all vaccinated at "once, but have all since had the small pox. The "tracts on vaccination have been circulated, and "in many instances seem to have overcome the pre- "judices of people against this prudent operation." 10 "November 17th, 1850.—With regard to small "pox, the number of persons unvaccinated, dis"covered by the Inspector, amounts to 146. Of "these ho has ascertained that upwards of 60 have "been vaccinated. I would especially call your "attention to the very imperfect organisation for "securing the vaccination of all persons existing "in this and other parishes of London. Although "notice is given to all parents that their children "must be vaccinated, no means are taken to see "that vaccination is carried into effect. The ope"ration in many cases seems to be carelessly "performed; and sufficient evidence is not obtained "that every child who has been vaccinated has "had the operation properly and effectively per"formed. The subject of re-vaccination is one "that also deserves attention, as there is no doubt "that, up to a given age, the longer persons have "been vaccinated, the more liable they are to take "small pox. One of the causes, I believe, of the "imperfect performance of vaccination, is that a "properly educated medical man does not care "to undertake the operation of vaccinating the "poor for the small sum which is now given. I "think that either one officer should be appointed, "with a salary that would make it worth while "that he should attend to the whole of the vacci"nation for the parish, or that, if a number of "vaccinators are appointed, the cases should be "placed under some kind of superintendence. But "the most important point I believe to be the 11 "ascertaining that every child born in the parish "is vaccinated within a given time." "December 1st, 1859.—The number of cases of "small pox reported in the parish, to the present "time, is 13. The number of children discovered "to be unvaccinated, by the inquiries of the "Inspector, is 163. Of these, 91 have been "vaccinated, and 74 are still unvaccinated. Many "of the poor persons complain that when they "take their children to be vaccinated, the vacci"nators have no vaccine matter. I think at this "season it should be imperative on the vaccinators "to keep a constant supply of virus, in order that "persons should have no excuse for leaving their "children unvaccinated." The result of these efforts to arrest small pox cannot at present be estimated, but I hope my Report for the year 1860 will shew that the whole parish has been visited, and that a system will be in existence by which it shall be ascertained that every child born in the parish has been properly vaccinated. In the meantime, it is almost impossible that some should not escape, however finely the net of supervision may be woven. It is these few unvaccinated persons who move about in society that are likely to catch small pox, and convey it to the homes of those less susceptible than themselves. To catch such persons, and compel them to be vaccinated, is the task that every one should give themselves conscientiously to do. I have 12 suggested that the following classes of persons should undertake the duties of Sanitary Inspectors, and assist in abolishing those perpetual nuisances— the unvaccinated:— 1. All committees of public schools, and all masters and mistresses of private schools, might insist that no child should be admitted to the school without evidence of vaccination. 2. All employers of labour in workshops, factories, or other establishments, might require certificates or proofs of vaccination from the persons they employ. 3. No persons should be admitted into hospitals or workhouses without inquiry as to whether they were vaccinated, and if not, the operation should be performed upon them as soon as convenient. 4. All persons employing servants of any description should inquire, before they engage them, if they have been vaccinated. 5. Licensed public lodging-house keepers might be made to require of their lodgers whether they were vaccinated or not. Every one should be made to feel their responsibility in relation to this disease. It might be entirely arrested, and for ever banished from the earth, if people would act intelligently upon the known laws of its existence and spread. In two years it has carried off nearly 2000 persons 13 in London. Where one person has died, at least ten contract the disease and get well. The cost of this death and disease to the community is a matter of easy calculation, and is another instance of the lavish expenditure which a neglect of the laws of health inflict on the community. The next zymotic disease from which we have suffered is measles. The mortality from this disease has not been very variable during the four years previous to 1859. In 1855, it was 7 ; in 1856, 11; in 1857, 13; in 1858, 10; but in 1859, it was 38. This is the highest mortality presented by any of the forms of zymotic disease during the last four years. It is undoubtedly preventible by the same precautions as the other forms of contagious disease, but so ineradicably fixed in the minds of all parents is the notion that children must have the measles, and that it is a mild and harmless disease, that nothing which can be said or done for its prevention will carry any weight with them. It is generally a mild disease, and passes off without serious symptoms, but occasionally its epidemic visitations are very severe, as in the case of our own parish during the past year. Its head quarters have been the crowded districts of Berwick Street and Golden Square; for whilst the deaths were but 4 in the St. James's Square district, they were 34 in the two former districts. Not only does this disease spread more rapidly in crowded districts, but the mortality is larger. When children are habitually exposed to the depressing effects of ill- 14 ventilated and over-crowded rooms, there they more readily succumb to a disease like measles. Although the mortality from diarrhoea, in 1859, did not rise so high as in 1857, it nevertheless exceeded the average of the last four years. The death was almost entirely confined to the summer and autumn months, and in only 3 cases occurred in persons above 5 years of age ; and of the remaining 17, 12 were infants under one year old. That this fatal result has been produced, in the majority of cases, by improper feeding, I have no doubt; and I believe, from inquiries made into the history of several cases at the time, that one of the most common errors in diet is the feeding children with cows' milk that has been kept till it has begun to change. In the hot summer season, milk rapidly becomes acescent, and, when administered in this state, it brings on diarrhoea. The tendency to diarrhoea is also increased in the summer season of the year by the drinking of unfiltered and surfacewell water, which, after standing a little time, becomes putrescent, and is capable of producing the same state of change in food with which it is mixed*. Scarlet fever has also presented an excess, in 1859, over preceding years. This disease is usually more fatal than measles, and carries off a large number *As confirming the above, I may refer to a statement, made by Dr. Dauglish, the patentee of the process for making aerated bread, at a recent meeting of the Society of Arts, that the flour in this process underwent an injurious fermentation, from having been made with unfiltered water supply of the district in which the bakery is situated; and that on subsequently using boiled water, the fermentation was prevented. 15 in proportion to those attacked. It is associated with diphtheria in the Tables of Mortality, of which five cases were fatal. The prevalence of these diseases in the early part of the year, induced me to issue a handbill, which will be found in the Appendix. Although typhus was more prevalent in 1859, it nevertheless presents a considerable less mortality than the average of the last four years. Turning to some other diseases, in the Tables to which I have drawn your attention in previous years, I would point out that phthisis carried off 100, which is about the average for the last five years. Diseases of the lungs present a considerable diminution. The deaths, in 1858, were 151; whilst, in 1859, they were but 117. At a future time, when further data are supplied, it may be an interesting question for inquiry, as to whether there is not a relation between the numbers dying of zymotic diseases—such as hooping cough and measles—and those who die from the various forms of disease of the lungs. It may be that those who are predisposed to disease of the lungs, are those who, on being seized with hooping cough or measles, sink under these diseases, not so much from the action of the poison of the disease, as from their predisposition to lung disease. There is one group of deaths which present in our parish a very extraordinary increase, and which I do not think I ought to pass over without notice. I allude to the record of deaths by suffocation. Of 16 the 14 cases recorded this year, 11 are of infants under one year of age. In 1856, only two such cases were recorded; in 1857, not one; in 1858, there were only four. It appears that, in general, these cases are recorded as found dead in bed with their parents. Such death is suggestive of culpable carelessness on the part of parents, or of horrible criminality. It does not appear that in these cases Coroner's inquests are always held, and therefore no admonition is conveyed to those who have thus carelessly deprived their offspring of life, and no chance afforded of bringing those (if any) who are guilty of crime tc justice. I drew your attention last year to the number of deaths which occurred without the certificate of a medical attendant, and in which no Coroner's inquest was held. I have long been convinced that the machinery which brings this most important institution into operation is most deficient. In cases of death, where crime is suspected, or where no legal medical attendant has been called in, the circumstances should be investigated by a properly educated medical man, whose business it should be to investigate thoroughly the causes of death, and on his report made to the Coroner should the inquest be summoned. Under the present circumstances, where it is thought necessary to make inquiry, the person employed is one of the parish constables, who, however conscientiously he may perform his duties, never receives that kind of education which would enable him to give a satisfactory report upon the probable causes 17 of death in such cases. The inquiry in these cases involves a knowledge of all the external symptoms of death by violence, and the competence to make post-mortem examinations, and the application of the tests for the presence of poison in suspected cases. There is the more reason for placing this inquiry in the hands of such an officer, as the law does not require that the Coroner should be a medical man. The importance of this subject will, I hope, be seen in relation to the large increase in the kind of death to which I allude. Some public movement is, I feel, required, to arrest the apparent indifference which exists amongst our population to the destruction of infant life. The increase of infant mortality, under the head of " Suffocation," is not confined to our parish, but embraces the whole Metropolis. In 1858, there were 230 deaths from suffocation, and in 1859, there were 288 deaths from the same cause. As a proof that there is something more than an increasing indifference to the sanctity of human infant life, I would refer to the fact, that recently no less than eight children were found murdered in one week, in various parts of London". We sometimes refer with horror to the permission of the crime of infanticide amongst the thickly populated cities of other parts of the world ; but if something more is not done to arrest the tendency to the same crime amongst ourselves, our turn will come to excite the indignation of the world,—but with this difference, that out guilt will * Weekly Return of Births and Deaths in London,—May 26tb, 1860. B 18 be regarded as greater, because we have let this crime spring up amongst institutions, which, if properly worked, are capable of preventing its terrible progress. Amidst all the existing causes of disease, and death, and the loss of life by preventible causes, it is something to find that the average of births still continue above the average of death. It has been sometimes ignorantly assumed that an excess of births over deaths is an embarrassment to a community; but if persons holding such an opinion will reflect that all wealth is the result of human labour, then the larger the number of human beings the greater the means by which wealth may be accumulated in the community. At the same time, it should bo remembered that in parishes situated as St. James's, Westminster, it is impossible to increase the numbers within the limits of the parish without overcrowding, and its consequences, disease and death. The excessive mortality of the Berwick Street division may, in some measure, be due to the fact, that the population increases more rapidly than the people can pass to other neighbourhoods. The following Table present in the parish for the last ten years:— Years. No. Years. No. 1850, 889 1855, 892 1851, 946 1856, 973 1852, 917 1857, 973 1853, 926 1858, 921 1854, 941 1859, 951 19 The average number of births for the last ten years is 933, whilst the average number of deaths is 760, so that the average annual excess of birth is 173. If these persons have remained in the parish, then the population has increased by 1730. From the fact that the births have increased more largely during the last quinquennial, than the first quinquennial period, it would appear that the population has actually increased. Thus, we find the average births of the five first years was 923, whilst of the second five it was 942. This conclusion must not, however, be arrived at too hastily, as there are other circumstances which increase the births in a community, as higher wages and improved sanitary arrangements. Thus, the average deaths of the first quinquennial period was 800, and the increase of births during that period over the deaths was only 123, whilst the average deaths of the second quinquennial period was only 716, consequently the average annual increase of births over deaths was 226. This clearly shews the necessity, in parishes like our own, of preventing overcrowding, for if, on the one hand, we save life and cause it to accumulate, we shall, on the other hand, be inviting those diseases which carry off life in over-populated districts. In my last Report I gave a list of the kitchens which were emptied of their inhabitants in 1857-8, and during the past year several others have been added to the list. In this manner a certain number 20 of houses have been relieved of an excess of population. But overcrowding occurs in other parts of houses as well as the kitchens, and I have found it necessary to apply a rule of space to such dwelling-rooms, and to regard those as nuisances injurious to health that do not allow 500 cubic feet of space for each individual. In this way several rooms occupied by large families have been relieved of their tenants, and if the population of the parish has not been diminished by this operation, it has, at least, been more equably diffused, and the evils of overcrowding to some extent alleviated. One of the great evils of our large cities is the necessity of keeping various animals in confinement, which contribute greatly to the amount of refuse produced and the deterioration of the purity of the atmosphere. This is more particularly the case with cows and horses, which, on account of their size, require extensive accommodation. I have, in previous Reports, referred to the large number of cows kept in our parish, and to the nuisance they create in the immediate neighbourhoods where they are kept. Those who keep these animals have shewn every disposition to mitigate the evils of which they are the source, but every effort fails to prevent a residence near to these establishments free from an amount of inconvenience and annoyance, which has a very injurious effect upon surrounding property. In behalf of these places 21 it cannot be urged that they are necessary to the community, as it has been shewn that an abundance of pure and unadulterated milk can be supplied to London by the aid of the quick transit of railways. Although it has been urged that London milk is in no way inferior to country milk, I believe that it will be found of less value as an article of diet, and that it is more prone to those putrefactive changes which renders milk so dangerous an article of diet during the heat of summer. The keeping of horses seems to be a matter of greater necessity than that of cows. Hence the importance of seeing that they are not kept in such a manner as to be injurious to the health of those by whom they are surrounded. There are few sources of nuisance which are more constantly complained of than ill-kept and ill-drained stables. Hence, from the commencement of my duties as Medical Officer of Health, I -have directed my attention to the condition of the mews and stables in the parish. This subject has also been taken up by the Association of Metropolitan Officers of Health; and feeling the importance of gaining accurate information on the number of stables and horses kept in the Metropolis, they issued a blank sheet of inquiries, to be filled up by the Sanitary Inspectors of the various parishes of London. A set of these Tables has been filled up for this parish, and I have added them in the Appendix of the present Report. 22 From the data furnished by these Tables, I find that there are 392 stables in this parish, and that in these are kept 1,057 horses. With many of these stables coach-houses are connected, and, above these, rooms are frequently set apart as dwelling-places. The number of persons residing in these rooms is 901, or about a fortieth part of the whole population of the parish. Although no decided evidence is afforded in these Tables of the injurious nature of these residences upon the health of those dwelling in them, there can bo no doubt that constant exposure to the emanations from stables, night and day, is injurious to health, and especially to that of young children. The regular inspection of the stables not only afforded the means of judging of the extent to which they existed in the parish, but also afforded an opportunity for the discovery of many serious nuisances. Of the stable yards, 9 were defectively paved; 5 had imperfect drainage; 7 were in a dirty condition. Of the stables themselves, 41 were defectively paved; 38 had bad drains; and 41 had no drains at all; 71 stables were in a filthy condition, requiring cleaning and whitewashing; whilst 238 (considerably above half) were imperfectly ventilated. Of the human dwellings above the stables, 30 were badly ventilated; in 33, the effluvium from the stables was complained of. By reference to the Sanitary Inspector's Report, it will be seen that altogether 268 nuisances were complained of, and 23 that up to the end of the year, 208 had been removed or abated. This investigation has led to a great improvement in the condition of the stables, which cannot fail to have a beneficial effect not only on the health of the human inhabitants connected with them, but also on the health of the animals to which they are devoted. In fact, the response to the notices of improvement in the stables shewed that the owners were quite alive to the value of the health of the animals that lived in them—a response which it is sometimes difficult to arouse in behalf of the human occupants of houses needing sanitary amendment. With regard to the practice of allowing families to dwell in rooms above stables, I have the conviction that it is injurious to their health, and that the sooner the practice is abolished, the better will it be for the health of the community. For some years past I have taken considerable interest in the purification of the water of the Serpentine in Hyde Park. This piece of water is of interest not only to the inhabitants of the parishes in which it is situate, but to all the neighbouring parishes. It is not only a place of exercise and recreation for the more opulent classes of society, but it is a great public morning and evening bath, open to all who have time and leisure to gain access to it. On both accounts it is connected with the health of the community, and claims the attention of the Medical Officers of Health in whose locality 24 it is situated. This piece of water is open to the objection of all masses of standing water, which contain decomposing animal or vegetable matter. During the summer season the water becomes deoxygenated, and the consequence is, that the animal and vegetable matter contained in it give off putrid and injurious compounds into the atmosphere. In the Serpentine a larger quantity of such matters are found, on account of the large mass of vegetation which grow on its banks, as well as the unhappy arrangement by which the stored waters of the Ranelagh sewers are allowed to pass into it. These I believe are the principal causes which have led to the presence of the effluvium, which has been so much complained of by those who walk or drive on its banks. These evils can only be got rid of by shutting off the contents of the Ranelagh sewer, and supplying a quantity of fresh water sufficient to oxygenate the decomposing vegetable matters which are produced by the plants in the water and the trees around. This would probably serve to render the water free from objection to those who frequent its banks for exercise, but for those who use it as a bath much more extensive change is needed. Not only does the water of the Serpentine contain organic matter suspended, but at the bottom it contains mud several feet in thickness, which, being stirred by the bather, renders the water turbid, and even odorous, and unfit for purposes of 25 healthy ablution. This mud also not unfrequently entangles the bather, and causes his death. To render this a fit or safe place for bathing, this mud should be got rid of. In the next place, the Serpentine is a most unfit place for a bath, on account of the irregularities of its bottom. In some places there are deep holes, which entrap the unwary bather, and lead to his destruction. One of the first necessities for making this a safe bath is the getting rid of these holes, and making a uniform surface at the bottom, with a depth that would prevent the risk of loss of life to those who bathe. Attempts have been made to purify the water, but the Government has not yet sanctioned any plan for cleaning and improving the bottom. As its use as a bath is more particularly confined to the populations surrounding it, it would perhaps hasten any steps for the improvement of this lake, if the parishes of St. George's, Hanover Square, Chelsea, Brompton, Kensington, Bayswater, Paddington, St. Marylebone, and St. James, Westminster, were to combine for the purpose of pressing on the Board of Works the necessity of immediate steps for the improvement of this water as a great Metropolitan bath. I would say this on the ground that bathing is a most healthful exercise, and that a knowledge of the art not only tends to strengthen the human frame, and gives courage and self-reliance amidst the dangers to which the population of this 26 girt island are so frequently exposed, but that it often enables persons to save their own lives, and those of others, when accidently plunged in the water. Whilst on the subject of public recreation, I would call attention to the necessity there exists for a population like that of St. James's, Westminster, to secure exercise in the free open air, away from the smoke of chimneys and the emanations of sewers and drains. Recreation-grounds exist undoubtedly in our neighbourhood, in St. James's, the Green, and Hyde Parks; but, if we except the objectionable Serpentine for a bath, are there temptations enough to induce our tailors and shoemakers, our clerks and shopmen, to visit these parks I think not. There are no games allowed, and no means of refreshment of any kind exist. A walk in one of our parks is, after all, a dull monotonous affair for a working man, and no wonder that so few are found there. What I would advocate is that certain portions of the parks should be railed off, so as to allow of cricket and other games,—and in these games we should find at once the means of attraction and relaxation. In most of the parks of continental cities the sale of refreshments is allowed; and if this was done in our own parks, confining the refreshments to tea, coffee, and unfermented beverages, with bread and fruit, I am sure it would be the means of drawing many from the unhealthy atmosphere of the billiard-room and ale-house. Our English notion of the use of a park 27 is too limited; and however pleasing it may be to those of cultivated tastes to see trim walks and varied flowers and shrubs in place of open greens and commons, I cannot but regret to see how little use is made by the people of the one instead of the other. The boundless mirth of children at their games, and the rude gaiety of working men on our open commons, were infinitely preferable, in a sanitary point of view, to the orderly respectability of the few who now seek quietude in the well-ordered parks into which some of our commons and greens have been transformed. These last subjects may seem somewhat foreign to the immediate work of your Medical Officer of Health; but I claim in these Reports the privilege of pointing out those general principles of sanitary science, which must be known and understood by the whole community before they can be acted on by the Legislature. I believe that the Medical Officer of Health may be doing as much good by drawing the attention of his fellow-parishioners to the general field of sanitary action, as by confining himself to the details of his own locality. The good that is to be done by sanitary science is more through enlightened public opinion acting upon the whole community, than by stringent laws acting in particular instances. In the confidence that I shall ever have your sympathy and support, as I have had hitherto, 428 wherever the physical improvement of your fellowparishioners demand it, I have the honour to he, My Loud and Gentlemen, Your most obedient humble Servant, EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. APPENDIX, CONTAINING 1.

JAMES H. MORGAN, Sanitary Inspector. Sanitary Directions issued in 1859, by the Medical Officer of Health. SCARLET FEVER. As this Disease is extensively prevailing in the Parish, and is highly contagious, Persons in whose families it breaks out should observe the following Rules:— 1. In all cases the sick person should be separated from the rest of the family, either by removing the healthy part of the family or the sick person. In the case of those needing assistance for the removal of the sick, application should be made at the Workhouse, Poland Street. 2. In cases where the disease has broken out the children should on no account be sent to School till such time as the medical attendant shall certify that there is no danger of their conveying the infection. In many instances the occurrence of Scarlet Fever has been traced to the children of infected families having been sent to school, and though not having the disease themselves, have, through their clothes, given it to others. 3. Grown up persons who have been in contact with those affected with the disease should avoid attending public places, riding in omnibuses, or in any manner coming in contact with others, until they have changed their clothes, or exposed them to heat, or washed them in hot water. 4. In the case of those ill with the fever, the door of the room should be kept open and all windows should be occasionally or constantly kept open, according to circumstances, to secure the escape of bad air and the entrance of fresh air. 92 5. The room and everything about the sick person should be kept perfectly clean. The linen should be frequently changed and all dirty linen removed and put immediately into cold and afterwards well washed in hot water. Things that cannot be washed in water, as beds, &c. that have been in contact with the patient, should be exposed to the heat of an oven before they are used again. Articles of this kind can be exposed to the necessary heat in the drying stoves at the Baths and Wash-houses, Marshall Street. 6. The vessels used in the sick room should be well washed and rinsed out with a solution of Chloride of Lime or Condy's Disinfecting Fluid. The latter should also be mixed with any refuse from the sick room which is thrown down the sinks or water closets. 7. No person should be allowed in the room but those who are needed to attend upon the sick, and they should place themselves on that side of the bed towards which the current of air comes, and should endeavour to avoid inhaling the patient's breath and the vapour from the body. As some persons imagine that Scarlatina and Scarlet Fever are different Diseases, it cannot be too extensively known that they are one and the same disease, and that the mildest cases are capable of communicating the most destructive forms of the disease. (Signed) EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. By Order of Vestry, 21st Oct. 1859. Sanitary Powers under the Department of Medical Officer of Health. The Vestry desire to draw the attention of the Parishioners of St. James's, Westminster, to the powers conferred upon them by "The Metropolis Local Management Act," the "Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Act," and "The Vaccination Extension Act," for the removal of all nuisances injurious to health, the prevention of the sale of unwholesome food, the prevention of the overcrowding of houses, and the enforcing the practice of Vaccination. Nuisances.—By the 8th Clause of "The Nuisances "Removal and Diseases Prevention Act," the following are regarded as Nuisances:— "Any Premises in such a state as to be a Nuisance or "injurious to Health:" "Any Pool, Ditch, Gutter, Watercourse, Privy, Urinal, "Cesspool, Drain, or Ash-Pit so foul as to be a Nuisance "or injurious to Health:" "Any Animal so kept as to be a Nuisance or injurious "to Health :" "Any accumulation or Deposit which is a Nuisance or "injurious to Health:" By the powers of the Act, the Vestry has power to compel the removal of all such Nuisances; and, in case of refusal, to perform the work, and demand payment from the responsible parties. Drains.—By the 82nd Clause of "The Metropolis Local "Management Act," the Vestry can, through their Officers, 94 inspect any Drain, Water Closet, Privy, Cesspool, or Water supply Apparatus, which is known to be a Nuisance, or suspected to be so, with the object of ascertaining the state of the same, in order that any Nuisance they may produce, may be removed. Dust, Ashes, etc.—By the 125th and following Clauses of the same Act, the Vestry has power to employ Scavengers for the collecting and removing all Dirt, Ashes, Rubbish, and Filth, and for the emptying of Privies and Cesspools, Sewers, and Drains; and all persons obstructing the Scavengers in the performance of their duty are liable to a penalty of Five Pounds. Unwholesome Food.—By the 26th Clause of "The "Nuisances Removal and Prevention of Diseases Act," the Sanitary Inspector may, at all reasonable times, inspect and examine any Carcase, Meat, Poultry, Game, Flesh, Fish, Fruit, Vegetables, Corn, Bread, or Flour, exposed for sale; and if it appear to him that such food is unfit for use, the same may be seized, and the vendor thereof may be fined Ten Pounds. Noxious Trades.—By the 27th Clause of the same Act, the Medical Officer of Health has power to summon before the Magistrates any person carrying on any Trade, Business, or Manufacture, in which offensive effluvia are given out, and such persons may be compelled to use all practicable means for the removal of the same, under a penalty of Five Pounds. Occupation of Underground Rooms.—By the 103rd Clause of "The Metropolis Local Management Act," no room or cellar can be let or occupied unless the same be seven feet in height, and at least one foot of its height above the surface of the footway of the street, and unless 95 there be outside an open area three feet wide, with the use of a Water Closet and Ash-pit. It must also have a Fireplace and Chimney, with a glazed Window nine superficial feet in area, and opening so as to ventilate the room. Any person letting an underground room, not having these requirements, is liable to a penalty of Twenty Shillings for every day during which the same is let or occupied. Overcrowding of Houses or Rooms.—By the 29th Clause of "The Nuisances Removal and Diseases Preven"tion Act," it is provided that whenever the Medical Officer of Health "shall certify to the local authority that "any house is so overcrowded as to be dangerous or preju"dicial to the health of the inhabitants," the local authority may cause proceedings to be taken against the persons permitting such overcrowding, who can be fined Forty Shillings.—It has been held by the Magistrates of London that any house is "overcrowded," within the meaning of this Act, if the entire space of air available for each inhabitant is less than 400 feet. Small Pox and Vaccination.—By the 9th Clause of "The Vaccination Act," which was passed in order to check the extension of the dangerous disease, Small-Pox, it is made compulsory on all persons to have their children Vaccinated before they are three months' old, either by the Public Vaccinator or a properly qualified Medical Man. The Public Vaccinators, by whom persons are vaccinated gratuitously in this parish, are— Mr. W. B. Parkes, 41, Great Marlborough Street; Mr. John James, 49, Princes Street, Leicester Square. The Vestry, impressed with the necessity of carrying out the provisions of the above Acts with vigour, have appointed a Sanitary Committee, in conjunction with the Medical 90 Officer of Health, by whom the powers they possess will be put in force; and the Vestry hereby request all persons complaining of nuisances, or cognisant of an infraction of the above Sanitary Laws, to make known the same to their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Edwin Lankester; or to the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. James Morgan, at the Vestry Offices, 14, Marshall Street, Golden Square, where a Book is kept for entering complaints of nuisances, &c. Signed, by Order of the Sanitary Committee, EDWIN LANKESTER, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. Westminster: PRINTED BY THOMAS BRETTELL, RUPERT STREET. HAYMARKET.
