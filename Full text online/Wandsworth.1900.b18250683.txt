A preliminary meeting of the Councillors was held on the 6th November, pursuant to the Metropolitan Boroughs (First Election and First Meeting) Order. Various resolutions were passed, 25 containing recommendations with reference to the appointment of Committees, the carrying on of the business of the superseded authorities, and other transitory provisions. The Rev. J. H. Anderson was appointed to act as Chairman of the first Meeting of the Council. First Meeting of Council. The first Meeting of the Council was held First Meeting of council. on the 9th November, 190o. At this Meeting, Councillor John Lidiard was elected Mayor and the following gentlemen Aldermen, viz.:— Anderson, Rev. John Hendry, M.A. Howell, T. A. Ives Dickinson, William Howick, George Dryden, Sir A. E., Bart. Martin, Henry John Dunkley, William Osburn, Henry Ennis, George Wellborne, Chas. Evelyn Mr. Henry George Hills, the Clerk to the late Wandsworth District Board of Works, was unanimously appointed Acting Town Clerk, and the officers and servants of the several authorities whose powers and duties were transferred to the Council, and any other officers who were so transferred, were instructed to perform temporarily the duties which they had hitherto been accustomed to perform. The Commissioners for Public Libraries and Museums were requested to continue to act until the Library Committee was appointed. The London and South Western Bank, Ltd., was appointed Borough Treasurer. Casual Vacancies. Elections to fill the casual vacancies on the Council, caused by the election of the Aldermen, were held on the 6th December, when the following gentlemen were elected Councillors, viz.— Clapham North Ward Bulcraig, Henry. Clapham South Ward Kipling, J. G. 26 Streatham Ward Henderson, J. V. Hewett, W. J. Balham Ward Curtis, F. Tooting Ward Cudsen, J. Springfield Ward Milestone, W. C. No less than twenty local authorities having Committees. been merged in the Council, it is evident that an immense amount of work was required to transfer the duties of those authorities to the various Committees, and to set in motion the machinery for carrying on such duties. The list of Committees appointed is printed on pages 7 and 8, and a statement of their duties in Appendix "A." The Council has the satisfaction of recording that, although this work rendered necessary frequent and prolonged sittings of the Committees for some months, the transfer was effected and the business of the various departments continued without any hitch in the arrangements. Bye-Laws. A. special Committee was appointed to draft the Bye Laws or Standing Orders, and the Council passed a vote of thanks to Alderman Sir Alfred Dryden, Bart. (the Chairman) and the Committee for their valuable services in the matter. Libraries Committee. The Council having decided that the Libraries Committee should consist of sixteen Members of the Council and sixteen persons not Members of the Council, the following gentlemen (who are not Members of the Council) were appointed Members of the Committee, viz.:— Clapham:—Rev. C. P. Greene, B.A., Messrs. C. G. Hennings, H. Morgan and Dr. J. Sutcliffe. Putney:—Messrs. T. Gilbert, W. J. Gilks, W. H. Meyrick and Rev. S. Todd. Streatham:—Messrs. R. W. Essex, W. F.

In addition to the Orders and Schemes mentioned in the last Annual Report of the late District Board, the following Orders and Schemes have been made by the Commissioners under the London Goverment Act, viz:— 1. Clapham, Detached 2. Putney, Detached 3. Mitcham, Detached 4. Metropolitan Boroughs (First Election and First Meeting) 5. Adaptation of Enactments. 6. First Election and "Appointed Day" for the various purposes of the Act. 7. Metropolitan Boroughs (Triennial Election of Councillors) 8. Rate Collection Accounts. 28 9. London Registration. 10. Clapham Scheme. 11. Putney Scheme. 12. Streatham Scheme. 13. Tooting Scheme. 14. Wandsworth Scheme. 15. Rating and Poor Law Valuation. 16. Metropolitan Boroughs (Offices). 17. Adoptive Acts. 18. Existing Officers. 19. London (Valuation) Supplemental 20. Miscellaneous. The Clapham, Putney, Streatham, Tooting and Wandsworth Schemes deal with the duties of the late Vestries relating to affairs of the Church, the substitution of nominees of the Borough Council in the place of the Overseers as Trustees of Charities, and the repeal of Local Acts. A Local Inquiry was held by one of the Assistant Commissioners, under the Local Government Act in each of the parishes, at which the Wandsworth District Board were represented by the Clerk to the Board, and the schemes, as finally settled, embodied most of the suggestions of the District Board. Metropolitan Boro' (Triennial Election of Councillors). The Council by an unanimous resolution requested the Local Government Board to make an order directing that the whole of the Councillors of the Borough should retire together every third year. Similar requests having been made by the other Metropolitan Borough Councils, the Local Government Board made an order directing that the whole of the Councillors of each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils should retire together on the ordinary day of election in every third year. Financial Arrengements Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of this scheme, meetings of the representative bodies for the several parishes in the Borough were held with the view of making an adjustment of the 29 property and liabilities. Particulars of the property and liabilities of the several parishes were prepared, and a Joint Committee, consisting of representatives of each of the Representative Bodies, appointed to consider the matter. At a subsequent meeting of each of the Representative Bodies it was decided that, having regard to the shares of the said respective parishes in the property and liabilities of the several authorities transferred to the Council and to all the circumstances of the case, the following adjustment should be made of the said property and liabilities, viz:— As from the 9th day of November, 1900, all the properties which on or immediately prior to the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District ceasing to exist were vested in the said Board of Works, or in any other Body, or in any persons or person for the benefit of any of the said Parishes, and which by virtue of the said Act passed to and became the property of the Council (except the properties hereafter referred to) are to be held by the Council to the use and for the benefit of the Borough as a whole, and that all the liabilities of the said Board of Works in respect of each and every of the said Parishes, and of every such other body or person as aforesaid for and on behalf of each and every of the said Parishes (except the liabilities hereafter referred to) are to be assumed by the Council as the liabilities of and are to be charged upon and borne by the Borough as a whole. The several properties which on or immediately before the said 9th day of November, 1900, were vested in or were under the control of the Commissioners for Baths and Wash-houses, Commissioners for Public Libraries, and Burial Boards, in and for each or any of the said several Parishes, and all the separate liabilities of such Commissioners and Boards, or of such respective Parishes in respect thereof, on the same date are as to such last-mentioned properties to be held by the Council to the use and for the benefit of such Parishes respectively, and are as to such liabilities to be an exclusive charge upon such Parishes respectively. The Borough Council concurred in the foregoing decision, and an agreement to the like effect was entered into between the respective Representative Bodies and the Council. This agreement is now under the consideration of the London Government Act Commissioners, whose approval is necessary. 30 The Council decided to take no action with respect to an adjustment of property and liabilities between the Council and authorities outside the Borough where there had been transfers of areas, it appearing to them that on the whole no advantage would be gained by taking proceedings in the matter. Expenses of Council. Under the system in force previous to the establishment of the Borough Council, the work of the various local authorities, including that of the District Board of Works, was carried on parochially. The London Government Act, however, provides that the amount to be raised to meet the expenses of the Borough Council is to be divided between the parishes in proportion to their rateable value subject to any provision required for the adjustment of local burdens. The Council, therefore, decided to have one Medical Officer of Health who should give his whole time to his duties, instead of having five as heretofore, and to have two Surveyors instead of four. The Officers and Servants Committee recommended also that there should be a Chief Librarian for the Borough, but this recommendation was not adopted by the Council. It should be stated that the Council is advised that the above-mentioned provision with respect to the allocation of expenses does not extend to the Adoptive Acts, i.e., to Public Libraries, Baths and Washhouses, and Cemeteries, the accounts of which continue for the present to be kept parochially. Officer One of the earliest duties of the Council was to re-arrange the staff for carrying on the work of the various departments. The great alteration in the system of local government and the large number of officials transferred to the Council from the twenty public bodies who formerly exercised powers in the Borough rendered this work somewhat 31 difficult. The offices of 31 officers were abolished as being unnecessary, and the claims of 26 of such officers for compensation for loss of office have been dealt with by the Council and allowances granted. Eight of the officers entitled to such allowances have been appointed to offices under the Council. In these cases the allowance will be suspended whilst they receive emoluments equal to those formerly received by them. Mr. Henry George Hills was unanimously appointed Town Clerk, Dr. P. Caldwell Smith, formerly Medical Officer of Health for the parish of Wandsworth, was appointed Medical Officer of Health for the Borough; Mr. H. J, Marten, formerly Surveyor for Streatham and Tooting, Surveyor for the Eastern District (comprising the parishes of Clapham, Streatham and Tooting); and Mr. P. Dodd, formerly Surveyor for Wandsworth, Surveyor for the Western District, comprising the parishes of Putney and Wandsworth. The other officers of the various authorities, with the exception of those whose offices were abolished, were continued in their appointments. Assessment Committee The Council being of opinion that there should be an Assessment Committee for the Borough appointed by the Council, as is the case in other Metropolitan Boroughs where the Borough is conterminous with the Poor Law Union, requested the Local Government Board to take steps for the division of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union, with the view of the appointment of such Committee by the Council in accordance with the Memorial presented to such Board by the Wandsworth District Board referred to in the last Annual Report of the District Board. 32 Rating of Small Property Upon the recommendation of the Rating Committee the Council passed the following resolutions with reference to the rating of and composition allowance to owners of small property, viz.:— That the owners of all rateable hereditaments situate within the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth to which section 4 of the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act, 1869, extends shall be rated in respect of such rateable hereditaments, instead of the occupiers, on all rates made after this date or, where agreements have been entered into with the Overseers of the several parishes in the said Borough, after the expiration of such agreements. That if the owner of one or more such rateable hereditaments shall give notice to this Council in writing that he is willing to be rated for any term not being less than one year in respect of all such rateable hereditaments of which he is the owner, whether the same be occupied or not, such owner be allowed, in addition to the abatement or deduction of fifteen per cent. from the amount of the rate provided by section 4 sub-section 1 of the said Act, a further abatement or deduction of ten per cent. from the amount of the rate during the time he is so rated. The practice in this matter, as in many other matters, varied in the different parishes in the Borough. The following Parliamentary Bills have been considered during the year, viz.:— 1. London County Council (Tramways and Street Widenings). 2. ,, „ „ Tramways (No. 2). 3. London United Tramways. 4. London Water (Purchase of Companies). 5. Metropolitan Water Companies (Amendment of Acts). 6. Thames Piers and River Service. 7. London Brighton & South Coast Railway (Various Powers), 8. South Metropolitan Gas. 9. Sale of Intoxicating Liquors to Children. 10. Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Inspectors. 11. Public Health. 12. Sites Values (London) Rating. 13. Local Authorities' Officer's Superannuation. 14. Gas Light and Coke Company. 15. Borough Funds Act Amendment. 16. Wandsworth and Putney Gas. 33 Tramway Schemes. The Highways Committee of the County Council having under consideration the question of what new tramways the Council should be advised to obtain powers to construct, asked for the suggestions of the late Wandsworth District Board with regard to the construction of tramways within the District. The Board informed them in reply that subject to all terms and conditions upon which it was proposed that any tramways should be constructed in the District being approved by the Board, the construction of the following tramways might be undertaken with advantage; 1. From the Tooting tramway terminus to High Street, Wandsworth. 2. From the Tooting tramway terminus to Figg's Marsh. 3. Along the extension of York Road, Red Lion Street, Buckhold Road, and Merton Road to the boundary of the parish of Wandsworth. The County Council decided to apply for powers to construct a tramway along the first mentioned route and also along Tooting High Street from the present terminus to the county boundary at Waterfall bridge, and stated that they were prepared to undertake the necessary widenings provided the Board agreed to give their formal consent to the construction of the proposed tramways, and undertook to contribute one-third of the nett cost of the street widenings, estimated at £301,950. The Council were informed that the Board were in favour of the proposed tramways and were willing to contribute one-third of the nettcost of the necessary street widenings, but that they could not give their formal consent to a Bill which they had not seen, and that their successors would no doubt give their consent if the provisions of the Bill were satisfactory to c 34 them. In December, the Borough Council confirmed the undertaking of the Wandsworth District Board, but expressed the opinion that one-third was too large a proportion to be contributed by this Borough, and suggested that the subject of the proper proportion of the cost of similar improvements to be contributed by local authorities shouldfreceive the consideration of the County Council in conference with the Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Council gave their consent to the introduction of the County Council Tramways Bill so far as it related to the above-mentioned tramways, reserving the right to petition against the Bill with the view of obtaining the insertion of clauses for the protection of the Borough. The County Council having inserted in the Bill some of the amendments desired by this Council, and given an undertaking with reference to some other matters, the petition of the Council was withdrawn. In addition to the above-mentioned tramways the London County Council's Tramway Bill included the following proposals, viz:— (a) A tramway commencing in the Lower Richmond Road, Putney at a point 1½ chains north-west of the junction of Lower Richmond Road with Putney bridge, passing thence across Putney bridge and along Fulham High Street, etc., to the northern end of Battersea bridge. (b) A tramway commencing by a junction with the existing tramway in St. John's Hill, Battersea, passing along Strath Terrace, Boutflower Road, Bolingbroke Grove, Nightingale Lane and Bellevue Road, Battersea, to the junction of Bellevue Road and Trinity Road, Wandsworth. Alteration of Tramways. York Road, near Wandsworth railway station. This Council objected to the construction of Tramways (a) and (b), and the proposals in respect of those lines were withdrawn. The Bill, as amended, was passed. 35 London United Tramways Co. This Company promoted a Bill to authorise them to construct the following amongst other tramways, viz •— (a) Tramway No. 1 Commencing in Upper Richmond Road, Putney, by a junction with Tramway No. 9 at a point 14 yards west of Roehampton Lane, passing along the road leading across Barnes Common, Rocks Lane, &c., to the Broadway, Hammersmith. (b) Tramway No. 1a. Commencing in Upper Richmond Road by a junction with Tramway No. 9 at a point 36 yards east of Roehampton Lane, passing into and terminating in the road leading accross Barnes Common to Rocks Lane by a junction with Tramway No. 1 at a point 30 yards north of Upper Richmond Road. (c) Tramway No. 9. Commencing in Kew Road, Richmond, and passing along Church Road, Sheen Road and Upper Richmond Road, and terminating in the lastnamed road at a point 24 yards west of Putney Hill. The Council opposed the Bill upon the following grounds viz:— 1. That if a tramway be constructed in the proposed road in this Borough it should be a double line and that the road should be previously widened to not less than fifty-four feet. 2. That the tramway is unnecessary. 3. That the London County Council have a system of tramways in the Borough The Mayor gave evidence against the Bill on behalf of the Council before the Committee of the House of Commons; the scheme was also strongly opposed by residents in the locality, and in the end the provisions relating to this Borough were struck out by the Committee. Electrical Traction on Tramways As stated in the last report of the Wands- worth District Board, the Board continued its opposition to this Bill in the House of Lords with the view of obtaining the insertion of c 2 36 provisions for maintaining the power they possessed of controlling the use of mechanical systems of traction which would interfere with the surface of streets vested in them, but the House of Lords Committee declined to amend the Bill as desired. The Committee also declined to alter the provisions of the Bill, as desired by the Board, so as to retain the control now exercised by them with respect to the nature of the paving outside the rails of the tramways, and its provisions with respect to the opening and reinstatement of trenches in the streets where there are no tramways for the purpose of laying cables, &c., for the conveyance of electrical power from generating stations to tramways. Considerable amendments were, however, made to the Bill by the London County Council after its introduction owing to the representations made by this Board and other local authorities. Amongst these were provisions to the effect that no overhead system of traction is to be used in any district without the consent of the Local Authority, and such authorities are to be heard by the Board of Trade before any system of electrical traction is sanctioned and before the regulations are made under which the system is worked. The Lambeth Vestry was the only other road authority which opposed the Bill in the House of Lords, and the Board regretted that so few of the local authorities were willing to incur the expense and trouble of appearing before Parliamentary Committees for the maintenance of their rights and interests in such matters. Amongst other amendments made in the Bill was one to the effect that the reconstruction of the Westminster to Tooting line of tramway for electrical traction should be completed not later than the first of January, 1903. The Council settled in confe rence with 37 the representatives of the County Council the terms upon which the sanction of the Board of Trade should be asked to the reconstruction of the line in question. Tenders have been invited by the County Council for the work and it is hoped that it will be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. The repairing of the road with wood has been deferred by this Council in order that the paving of the tramway and of the margins may be carried out at the same time. London Water (Purchase of Companies This Bill, promoted by the London County Council, would have empowered the Council to purchase the undertakings of the eight London Water Companies, and would have transferred to the Council the properties, rights, and powers of the Staines Reservoirs Joint Committee. In the event of the Council and the Companies not coming to an agreement for the purchase the matter was to be settled by arbitration. The Bill provided that there should be paid by the Council such a sum of money as the arbitrators determined to represent the fair and reasonable value of the undertaking, together with such further sum as the arbitrators might award to meet the cost of re-investing such money (in the event of no arrangement being made by the Council under which such money might be re-invested without cost), and the arbitrators in order to ascertain such sum were to enquire into and consider all the circumstances of the case, but no allowance was to be made for compulsory purchase. The Council would have been authorised to appoint a Committee (to include representatives of other bodies and persons not members of the Council), and to delegate to such Committee any powers with reference to the management and administration of the water supply. This Council disapproved of the Bill It was rejected by the House of Commons on the second reading. 38 Metropolitan Water Companies (Amendment of Acts). This Bill was also promoted by the London County Council, and had for its object the extension till the 6th June, 1906, of the provisions contained in the Staines Reservoir, &c., Acts, 1896 and 1898, to the effect that the purchase price to be paid tor the undertakings of the New River, West Middlesex, and Grand Junction Water Companies should not be enhanced by any advantages conferred on such Companies by the Acts above-mentioned in the event of such purchase being effected otherwise than by agreement before the 14th of August, 1903. The Bill received the Royal Assent on the 26th July. Thames Piers & River Service Bill. By this Bill the London County Council sought powers to acquire, take over, and administer the river piers and landing stages on the Thames, for constructing additional piers and altering the location of piers, and to establish an efficient steamboat service on the river. The County Council was informed that this Council was of opinion that in any scheme for river passenger steamers Wandsworth should be included as a place of call, and especially so in the early morning and evening so that working men, who largely inhabited the district, might take advantage of it, and, that the pier should be improved. The Bill was, however, rejected by the House of Commons on second reading. London, Brighton & South Coast Railway Company Bill. This Bill authorizes the Company to acland near the bridge carrying the Company's railway over Eardley Road, Streatham (including parr of the River Graveney) for the purpose of the construction of sidings there. The Council suggested that provision should be made for adequate means of communication between the districts on either side of the Company's railway 39 to meet the requirements of those districts and future developments thereof. The Company agreed to the insertion in the Bill of a provision compelling them to construct the sidings at such a level as would allow of the formation of a road beneath, and to grant an easement to the Council in the matter, subject to the formation of such road within twenty years. The Bill received the Royal assent on the 26th July. South Metropolitan Gas. This Bill authorised the South Metropolitan Gas Company to acquire by agreement the portion of the Gas Light and Coke Company's undertaking which is on the south side of the River Thames. The latter Company were already under the obligation to charge in that portion of their district no higher price for the supply of gas than that charged by the South Metropolitan Company. The Bill empowered the Company to raise a millionand-a-half additional capital as ordinary stock, bearing a dividend of four per cent., subject to increase or decrease as provided by the Company's Acts of last Session. In the event of the purchase not being effected the amount to be raised is not to exceed £750,000. The Council decided not to take any steps in the matter. The Bill passed through Parliament. Sale of Intoxicating Liquors to Children. This Bill provided that every holder of a license who sold or delivered or allowed any person to sell or deliyer, any intoxicating liquor to any person apparently under 16 years of age for consumption either on or off the premises, should be liable to a penalty of forty shillings for the first and £5 for any subsequent offence. The Council petitioned in favour of the Bill. In the Act as passed 14 years has been substituted for 16 years, and intoxicating liquors delivered at the residence or working place of the purchaser or delivered 40 in sealed vessels for consumption off the premises are exempted from the operation of the Act, and persons sending children under the age of 14 years for intoxicating liquor are liable to the same penalty as the license holder. Public Health. This Bill provided amongst other things that a Sanitary Inspector should only be removable by the Sanitary Authority with the consent of the Local Government Board, or by that Board. The Wandsworth District Board were of opinion that Sanitary Inspectors should remain as at present under the control of the Authority by whom they are employed. The Bill was not passed. No action was taken with regard to the other Bills above mentioned. Wandsworth and Putney Gas Bill. As stated in the last Annual Report, the Wandsworth District Board continued their opposition to this Bill in the House of Lords; the London County Council also opposed the Bill with the view of placing the Company under the same conditions with respect to the examination of gas as the three great Metropolitan Companies; the Board supported the application of the Council and also asked for a reduction in the standard price; and the Battersea Vestry supported the views of the Board in the matter. After hearing the evidence of the promotors and counsel on behalf of the London County Council and the Board, the House of Lords Committee decided to report that the preamble of the Bill was proved. Upon consideration of clauses the Board obtained the insertion of provisions for:— 1. The widening of Warple Way and widenings of North Street on its eastern and western sides at its junction with Warple Way. 41 2. The conveyance to the Board by the Company of a piece of land abutting on the river Thames having a frontage to the river of 75 feet and extending on the south to the centre of Waterside. 3. The laying of gas mains in roads not taken over by the Local Authority at the reasonable depth required by the Authority. 4. The dead end of sewers created by the stopping up of highways to be provided by the Company with manholes, ventilators, and other necessary works for in specting, ventilating, cleansing, and flushing of such sewers. 5. Two testing stations, one in Putney and one in worth, away from the Company's works. 6. The testings for pressure to be at the public lamps, and the Board not to be bound to give more than two hours' notice of such testings to the Company. Burials. One of the first duties of the Burials Committee which carries out the duties of the late Burial Boards for the Parishes of Clapham, Putney, Streatham, and Wandsworth, was to deal with the changes effected by the Burial Act, 1900, which came into force on the 1st of January, 1901. Fees, other than for services rendered, are abolished, subject to the following provisions:— (a) Incumbents' fees payable in respect of matters arising in burial grounds laid out and used before the 10th July, 1900, are continued (subject to commutation) during the incumbency of the then existing incumbents, or for 15 years, whichever period is longer. (b) Parish clerks, and other ecclesiastical officers are entitled to compensation for the abolition of their fees. (c) Ministers' fees are collected by the Council and paid over to the Ministers who offi- 42 ciate at the burial— except in the cases of the incumbents of Putney, Roehampton, and Streatham, who are paid fixed sums agreed upon with the late Burial Boards in lieu of fees. The following table of fees payable to ministers has been adopted by the Council and approved by the Home Secretary, viz:— 1st Class, 10s. 2nd Class, 6s. 3rd class, 4s Interments not conducted within the specified hours:— 1st Class, 12s. 6d. 2nd Class, 7s. 6d. 3rd Class, 5s. The subject of the scale of other burial fees is at present under consideration. The fees payable to the Parish Clerks of Putney and Streatham having been abolished by the Burial Act, the subject of their compensation for loss of fees has been considered. The Parish Clerk of Streatham has accepted the amount granted by the Council. The question of the compensation of the Parish Clerk of Putney is under the consideration of the Home Secretary. Wandsworth public Baths. The Baths and Wash-houses Acts were adopted by the Vestry of the Parish of Wandsworth on the 26th November, 1897. The Commissioners acquired the freehold of the premises known as James' Yard, High Street, Wandsworth, for the sum of £3,800, and in 1900 obtained the sanction of the Local Government Board to borrow £36,000 for the purchase of the premises at James' Yard and the erection thereon of the necessary buildings. The foundation stone of the baths was laid by the Right Hon. A. J. Newton, Bart. (Lord Mayor of London), on the 43 6th October, 1900. Under the provisions of the London Government Act, the powers and duties of the Baths and Washhouses Commissioners and of the Wandsworth Vestry were transferred to the Wandsworth Borough Council, and at the first meeting of the Council after its constitution a Baths and Wash-houses Committee was appointed to carry on the work of the Commissioners. Rapid progress was made with the building, in order that the baths might be opened during the summer, and the baths were formally opened by the Mayor 011 the 6th July, when an entertainment consisting of swimming competitions, &c., was given, in the presence of a large number of residents. The baths were opened to the public on the 8th July, and have been used by an average number of 4,150 bathers per week. The First Class Swimming Bath is 100 feet long by 30 feet wide; there are 60 dressing boxes so arranged that they can be folded back against the walls. A gallery has been constructed round the four sides of the bath, providing accommodation for about 300 persons. The Second Class Swimming Bath is 85 feet by 30 feet, and there are 72 dressing boxes. The water is at present taken from the Company's main into each swimming bath and also to a large tank over the laundry, but an artesian well is being sunk at the back of the site, from which it is hoped a sufficient quantity of water will be obtained to supply all the requirements of the baths. The baths are lighted by electricity throughout, supplied at present by the County of London and Brush Provincial Electric Lighting Company, but provision is being made for generating the electricity on the premises. The architects were Messrs. Spalding & Spalding, and the builder, Mr. Walter Wallis. 44 The charges and hours are as follows:— CHARGES. First-class swimming bath (2 towels) 6d.

The Metropolitan Water Companies having proposed to make new regulations under the provisions of the Metropolitan Water Act, 1852, for preventing waste or misuse of water, a conference was held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, on the 4th February, 1901, at which the County Council, the Cities of London and Westminster, and most of the Borough Councils were represented. The Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Councillor Gay) and Alderman Anderson represented this Council. The Conference decided to ask the Local Government Board to adjourn their Inquiry into the proposed regulations in view of the fact that the Government had intimated 45 their intention of introducing a Bill in the Session of 1902 dealing with the water question, and requested the County Council to take the necessary steps for obtaining the amendment of the regulations as proposed by the Conference. This Council was represented at the Inquiry in support of the opposition of the County Council. At an early stage of the proceedings the Water Companies, in view of the strong opposition, withdrew their proposals. Skidding Wheels. The Council have had under consideration the serious damage done to roads in the Borough by the use of skidded wheels, and requested the County Council to take the necessary steps to empower them to make a bye-law, dealing with the skidding of wheels in the County of London, under sec. 26 (3) of the Highways and Locomotive Act, 1878. The subject is still under the consideration of the County Council. Removal of Offensive Matter. The Board of Works considered a proposal of the London County Council to amend the Bye-Laws relating to the removal of offensive matter. In some of the districts adjoining London, the removal of refuse is required to be carried out between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. Under the present Bye-Laws, offensive matter may be removed by road or water through London, between 4 a.m. and 10 a.m. during the summer, and between 6 a.m. and noon in the winter, and the proposal was to make the hours between 5 a.m and 10 a.m. and 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. respectively, and also to permit the removal by road during the period commencing two hours before sunset and ending one hour after sunset all the year round. The District Board expressed the opinion that offensive matter should be removed at night, and that if that course could not be adopted the present Bye-Law should continue in force, and that it was not desirable to permit the removal of offensive matter 46 during the evening, when there were so many people in the streets. A further communication has since been received from the County Council, suggesting that the hours should be from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. all the year round. The County Council were informed that this Council saw no advantage in any amendment if the hours were to be extended to 2 p.m., and considered that from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. was a more suitable time. In connection with this subject, it may be stated that the Borough Council have issued a circular to butchers, fishmongers, and greengrocers in the Borough offering to remove refuse from their premises daily. Forty-five tradesmen have expressed their desire to avail themselves of this offer, and the necessary arrangements are being made in the matter. Streets and Street Traffic. A Conference between the County Council and representatives of the London Local Authorities, on the subject of the existing regulations in connection with streets and street traffic, and the arrangements for carrying out such regulations, was convened by the London County Council. Dr. Gay and Mr. Simpson were appointed to represent this Borough. At the first meeting of the Conference on the 29th June, a Committee, consisting of one delegate from each Authority, was appointed to consider the several matters. Four meetings of this Committee were held and attended by Dr. Gay. The final meeting of the Conference was held on the 7th November. Various resolutions were passed at the Conference and communicated to the London Local Authorities. One of the resolutions passed was to the effect that house refuse should be removed daily where practicable. The London County Council having considered this resolution, wrote to this Council stating, that having regard to the extent of London, and the varying circumstances of the different 47 districts, it did not consider it practicable at present to make a Bye-Law requiring a universal daily collection, but that in the Council's opinion a collection twice a week is practicable and should be made compulsory, and that it was proposed to alter the Bye-Law accordingly. The Council informed the London County Council that the Council was making arrangements for the prompt removal and disposal of butchers', fishmongers', and other offensive refuse, and did not see the necessity of collecting house refuse more frequently than once a week, except in exceptional cases, for which provision is made in this Borough. The matter is still under the consideration of the County Council. West Hill, Wandsworth, Widening. For some time past negociations have been in progress with the owners of the property with the view of widening West Hill, between the police station and Santos Road, and application was made in September, 1897, to the London County Council, for its consent, and for a contribution towards the cost of the improvement. In April, 1900, a letter was received from the Council stating, that subject to the Wandsworth Board of Works agreeing not to oppose the construction by the Council of a light railway or tramway from Clapham to Putney, the Council would give its statutory consent to the widening, and would contribute one-half of the nett cost of the improvement. The Board stated in reply that the proposal of the County Council to force the Board to give its consent to the proposed light railway scheme as the price of a contribution towards the widening of West Hill, had been received by the Board with much surprise and regret, that the Board had no alternative but to decline to consent to the light railway scheme, and pointed out that the widening of the road in question was undertaken long before the light railway scheme was brought 48 forward. No further proposal having been made by the County Council, a deputation, consisting of Mr. A. R. Gridley, Rev. J. H. Anderson and Mr. Parker, attended before the Improvements Committee of such Council on the 17th July, in support of the withdrawal of the condition respecting the consent of the Board to the construction of a tramway or light railway. The County Council then asked that consent should be given to the construction at any future time of a tramway along the portion of the road which was proposed to be widened. This the Board declined to give. The matter was afterwards taken up by this Council in January, when the County Council was asked to give its consent to the proposed improvement, and to contribute two-thirds of the cost. The County Council, however, declined to alter its conditions. The Council has since informed the County Council, that it is proposed to widen the portion of West Hill in question to 60 feet, and that if the County Council will contribute two-thirds of the cost of the widening, as in the case of Garratt Lane, this Council will give its formal consent to the construction of a tramway along the portion of the road in question. The County Council propose to construct a tramway from Clapham to Kingston, and this widening may therefore be carried out in connection with that scheme. In the meantime those houses (ten in number) which have already been purchased by this Council for the purpose of the improvement have been pulled down and the public way so far widened. Streatham Common. The Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the London County Council recommended that Council to take steps to obtain the repeal or amendment of the clause in the scheme, with respect to Streatham Common, relating to the user by local clubs 49 of the specially reserved cricket ground on the common, and this recommendation was adopted. The Wandsworth District Board informed the County Council that they would oppose any attempt to interfere with the right of the local cricket clubs in the matter. The Parliamentary Committee of the County Council, after considering the subject, recommended that Council to take no further steps in the matter, and this was agreed to. Trinity Road & Wandsworth Common, West Side. The County Council having erected hurdles on the eastern side of Trinity Road, between West Side and Windmill Road, upon ground which, in the opinion of the Wandsworth Board, formed part of the public way, and having also proposed to fill up and add to the Common the ditch alongside the road which the Board had decided to pipe and add to the highway, the Board communicated with the County Council on the subject. After considerable correspondence, a give and take arrangement was arrived at, which will effect an important improvement by the widening of Trinity Road and West Side. Licenses for the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors. The notices of intention to apply for licenses for the sale of intoxicating liquors in the Borough were considered, and the cations opposed in certain cases where the Council was of opinion that licenses ought not to be granted. With the exception of some cases which were adjourned the applications opposed by the Council were refused. Totterdown Fields Estate. The London County Council having submitted plans for the laying out of this estate for the erection of houses for the working-classes, their attention was called to the density of population likely to arise owing to the number of houses per acre which D 50 it was proposed to place on the land, and they were asked to provide on the estate adequate playing grounds for children. In reply, the County Council stated that having regard to the proximity of the estate to Tooting Bee Common the provision of open spaces on the estate was, in its opinion, unnecessary. This Council pointed out that from 2,000 to 3,000 young children will be living on the estate, and urged that some open spaces should be provided there, as otherwise the only play-ground available for the children near their own homes would be in the public streets. This suggestion has not, however, been adopted at present. 51 APPORTIONMENTS.

THE Divisional Committee in making their first report since the Library has been placed under the control of the Borough Council, have pleasure in stating that the Library continues to work effectively in the interests of the ratepayers, and under somewhat improved financial conditions. Great attention has been paid by the Committee to the necessity for replacing a large number of soiled and worn-out books, and many new and interesting works have been added both to the Lending and Reference Departments. The number of volumes issued during the past year was 73,843, and the stock of books now amounts to 9,365. Both these figures show a considerable increase on previous years. No complete statistics have been kept as to the number of volumes consulted in the Reference Department, in consequence of the more popular books being kept in open cases readily available without the necessity 4 of application to the staff. It is highly satisfactory to note that this branch of the Library maintains its usefulness. Under the London Government Act of 1899 the authority of the Library Commissioners ceased to exist, and the duties devolved upon the new Borough Council of Wandsworth, who appointed the following Divisional Committee:—The Mayor (Councillor J. Lidiard, J.P.), Alderman W. Dunkley, Councillors H. Bulcraig, T. E. Comins, and J. H. Gibson, the Rev. C. P. Greene, B.A., Mr. C. G. Hennings, Mr. H. Morgan, and Dr. J. Sutcliffe. At the first meeting of the Divisional Committee the Rev. C. P. Greene was appointed Chairman. In conclusion, the Committee have great pleasure in bearing testimony to the efficiency of the staff and the general satisfactory working of the Library. On behalf of the Committee, CHARLES P. GREENE, Chairman. 5 STATEMENT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS FOR THE PARISH OF CLAPHAM, S.W., for the Period from 26th March to 9th November. 1900.

REPORT OF THE DIVISIONAL COMMITTEE FOR PUTNEY. In presenting their report for the year ended March 31st, 1901, the Committee have pleasure in stating that the Library continues to be extensively used in every department. The Reference Library attracts a large number of teachers and students who highly prize the free access to valuable works that would otherwise be beyond their reach. No record can be kept of the actual number of volumes consulted. In the Lending Library the number of borrowers has largely increased, being 719 more than last year. The Committee regret that the maintenance of the Library, added to the extremely high cost of electric lighting, almost absorbs their present income, leaving practically no margin for the purchase of new books. They are again greatly indebted to H.M. Stationery Office, to the Trustees of the British Museum, and to other generous donors for gifts of books. The important change brought about by the inclusion of Putney in the Borough of Wandsworth, necessitated the retirement of the existing Library Commissioners. The Rev. R. A. Redford, Chairman of Commissioners from 1889 to November, 1900, having 14 left the parish did not seek re-election, and Miss Redpath and Mr Frank Chasemore also retired. The Committee desire to record their high appreciation of the services rendered by these Commissioners for many years. In November, the Reading Circle and the Architectural Class from the Regent Street Polytechnic visited the Library, when a lecture on the English Cathedrals, illustrated by the Models on Exhibition, was given by Mr. J. Whitehead. Lending Library. The number of volumes in this department is 6,979 the number of borrowers 3,100. Only 100 books were added by purchase during the year, while 719 new borrowers joined the Library. The number of volumes issued was 64,627, nearly 4,000 more than in any previous year. Full information, including a classification, may be found on page 16. Magazine Room. For this room there are provided 33 monthly magazines and reviews, 7 quarterlies, and 36 weekly periodicals, which may be found in the list on pages 19 and 20. The magazines are transferred to the Lending Library at the end of each month, and are bound as the volumes are completed. News Room. Thirty copies of daily newspapers, including the more important provincial dailies, and 80 weekly newspapers and periodicals are provided in this room. Up to November 9th, the Library Commissioners met on 9 occasions, the Books Committee 5 times, the Works Committee 6 times. This Committee has met 7 times.

The Streatham Divisional Committee have pleasure in reporting a considerable increase in the use made of the Libraries during the twelve months ended 31st March, 1901, the issue of 236,475 volumes being the highest hitherto recorded, and an increase of 8,861 on the previous year's return. Libraries Commissioners. The following gentlemen were the Commissioners for Public Libraries and Museums for the parish of Streatham for the period 26th March to the 9th November, 1900:—Mr. Benjamin Weir, Chairman; Mr. Bernard Cox, Mr. Cecil Dowson, Mr. R. W. Essex, Mr. H. Ellis Hill, M.I.C.E., Mr. Henry J. Martin, Mr. W. F. Massingham, Mr. Arthur E. Reade, and Mr. C. E. Wellborne. From that date the management of the libraries became vested in the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth; but, at the request of the Council, these gentlemen kindly carried on the work of the Streatham Public Libraries until the 31st December, 1900. The Streatham Divisional Committee. On the 1st January, 1901, the public libraries in the parish of Streatham were placed by the Libraries Committee of the Council under the care and management of a Divisional Committee consisting of:—The Mayor, Aldermen H. J. Martin and C. E. Wellborne, Councillors C. M. Ashdown and R. Simpson, M.A., with the Rev. H. Barron, Messrs. R. W. Essex, W. F. Massingham and J. F. Watson. Mr. Councillor B. Simpson, M.A., was elected Chairman of the Streatham Divisional Committee for the ensuing year. 25 Mr. Benjamin Weir, Chairman of the late Libraries Commissioners, was nominated at the Borough Council for a seat on the Divisional Committee, but on account of his great age and increasing infirmities he was reluctantly obliged to decline the nomination. The Committee desire to place upon record their great appreciation of the valuable services rendered by Mr. Weir, both as Hon. Treasurer (from 1890 to 1900) and as Chairman of the late Commissioners, and the expression of their regret at the loss which the Libraries have sustained by his retirement from this branch of his numerous public duties. Number of Books issued. The following Table gives the number of issued in the different classes of literature at the two libraries during the past year:— Class. Number of Books Issued. The Tate Library, Streatham. Branch Library, Balham. Total.

Readers' Tickets. Tickets to the number of 7,794 were issued readers, namely : 4,863 at the Central Library, and 2,931 at the Branch. As these tickets are available at both Institutions, it is therefore impossible to state how many persons restrict themselves to the use of the Central or Branch Library respectively. Tickets are granted for a period of twelve months. Number of volumes inStock. At the 31st March, 1901, the Streatham Public Libraries contained a stock of 23,703 volumes, namely: 18,380 at the Central, and 5,323 at the Branch. The classification of the stock is given in the following Table:— Class. Number of Volumes in Stock. The Tate Library, Streatham Branch Library, Balbam. Total. A.—Theology, Philosophy, etc. 1,276 248 1,524 B.—History and Biography 3,488 766 4,254 C.—Travels, Topography, etc. 1,419 388 1,807 D.—Science and Art 2,557 435 2,992 E.—Prose Fiction 4,527 2,549 7,076 p.—Poetry and the Drama 764 98 862 G.—Social Science, Politics, etc. 699 168 867 H.—Miscellaneous Literature, etc. 1,479 163 1,642 J.—Juvenile Department 1,311 479 1,790 Books of Reference 860 29 889 Total 18,380 5,323 23,703 27 Annual stocktaking. The Libraries were closed during the last Week in July for the purposes of annual stocktaking and cleaning. The books were examined and checked with the stock-registers, with the result that every volume could be accounted for. 580 books in a worn and soiled condition were withdrawn from the libraries. structural alterations, etc. During the summer months several alterations and improvements were effeeted at the Tate Library, which have considerably facilitated the work of the Lending Department. By the extension of the counter, more accommodation has been given to the public, and the additional desk for the issuing of books has relieved the pressure experienced by the staff during the busier hours of the day. The outside woodwork at the Central Institution has been re-painted, the ten large skylights above the Lending Department have been altered and repaired, and the ventilation, etc., at the Branch Library has been improved. At both libraries extra book-shelving and new indicators have been provided. catalogues. The late Commissioners printed, in September, a list of the books added to the Branch Library since the publication of the general catalogue. The Reading Rooms.The Reading Booms have been well attended during the year. Papers and periodicals to the number of 215 are provided at the Tate Library, and 117 at the Branch, several being presented by their respective publishers and other donors. A case of old Japanese coins, kindly presented by Mr. B. W. Essex, has been placed in the Magazine Boom at the Central Library. 28 The late Sir Henry Tate, Bart., J.P. Before the abolition of their office, the Commissioners felt it their duty to place in the Central Library some tangible record of their appreciation of the valuable services generously rendered to the public library movement in the Parish of Streatham by their late esteemed Chairman, Sir Henry Tate, Bart. The memorial is in the form of a suitable brass tablet bearing the following inscription:— The Cate Library, Streatham. The Public Libraries Commissioners desire to place on record in this Institution their appreciation of the gift of this building, and also of the public services rendered to the parish of Streatham by their late Chairman SIR HENRY TATE, Baronet, J.P. Donations. The Divisional Committee desire to express their thanks to those who have kindly presented books, periodicals, etc., to the Libraries during the past year, and at the same time they take this opportunity of appealing to others to similarly assist them in extending the usefulness of the Central or Branch Institution. A list of the donors is appended to this Report. Financial Statements. The Statement of Receipts and Expenditure by the late Commissioners for the period 26th March to 9th November, 1900, as audited, certified and allowed by the District Auditor, is appended. Also the Council's Financial Statement from the 9th November, 1900, to the 31st March, 1901. See pages 30-34. Proposed Extension of the Branch Library. The question of increasing the accommodation at the Branch Library was considered by the late Commissioners at the beginning of the last financial year, but the matter was allowed 29 to remain in abeyance, it being thought undesirable to incur, so near the termination of their tenure of office, the additional loan expenses necessary for carrying out the much needed extension. The Divisional Committee have recently given this important question their careful consideration, and the Council has decided to enlarge and suitably furnish the building at an estimated cost of £2,500. With this sum they hope to provide a Heading Room nearly three times the area of the existing one, and a Lending Department capable of storing eight times the present number of books.

To pay for the completion of Allfarthing Lane Branch Library application was made for sanction to a loan of £300. The necessary sanction was received from the Local Government Board, and dated 15th March, 1900, and in July, the Provident Life Office advanced the loan on mortgage to the Commissioners. The late Mr. G. W. Barnard very kindly negociated the loan free of charge to the Board. It was decided to close the Lending Libraries on the Saturday before Easter in each year, the News Rooms to be open as usual. In May, the commencement of the proceedings under the London Government Act, 1899, took place, and from that time till the election of the Borough Council in November, 1900, constant communications were received from the Privy Council Office. On behalf of the Commissioners, the Clerk objected to the inclusion of such parts of Wandsworth as College Park and Spencer Park within the proposed Borough of Battersea. The Vestry in July, re-elected Messrs. G. W. Eccles, 40 H. B. Hagreen and W. Hicks, as Commissioners, and Mr. John Bell, J.P., was asked to continue as Chairman of the Board. The portrait of Dr. G. D. Longstaff, the first Chairman (1883-1892) of the Library Commissioners, hangs in the Longstaff Reading Room. Since his death, in 1892, there have only been two Chairmen, Dr. G. B. Longstaff (1892-1893) and Mr. John Bell, J.P. (18931900). Portraits of these two have been placed in the Longstaff Reading Room. The Commissioners ceased to hold office on and from 9th November, and, at their last meeting, passed votes of thanks to the Chairman, Mr. John Bell, J.P., the Librarian, Mr. Cecil T. Davis, and the staff'. It is very much to be regretted that funds have never permitted the purchase of books in anything like an adequate number. On 12th November, a letter was sent by the Acting Town Clerk, to state that the Commissioners had been desired by the Council to act as Public Libraries Committee till the 31st December, 1900. The Rev. W. Reed, M.A., was elected Chairman. On 28th December, the Council appointed the following, as the Divisional Committee for the Parish of Wandsworth:—Councillor John Lidiard, J.P., Mayor Ex-Officio), Councillors W. J. Harrison, A. J. Littlechild, J. Luscombe, and F. Single, Messrs. G. W. Eccles and W. Hicks, Rev. W. Reed, M.A., and Rev. W. G. Tarrant, B. A. 41 At their first meeting this Committee elected the Rev. W. Reed, M. A., as Chairman. The fans at the Branch were replaced by and at the expense of the Electric Light Company, owing to an alteration in the periodicity of the current. The Surveyor recommended that work amounting to £353 10s. should be executed at West Hill Library. The statistics and list of donors for the year ended 31st March, 1901, are appended. W.

Sanitary Department REPORT ON THE Health and Sanitary Condition OF THE SEVERAL PARISHES COMPRISED IN THE WANDSWORTH DISTRICT DURING THE YEAR 1900 BY THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH TOGETHER WITH THE Report of the Public Analyst. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Gentlemen, We have the honour to present our Annual Report on the Health, Sanitary Condition, and Vital Statistics of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth for the year 1900. The report shows that a large amount of Sanitary and administrative work has been dealt with. The general scheme of the report is the same as in former years, but the Tables include the new Tables ordered by the Local Government Board. We are glad to be able to report that the health of the Borough has been all during the year in a very satisfactory condition, as evidenced by the remarkably low death-rate, and by the diminution in the number of cases of infectious diseases notified. We have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, THE MEDICAL OFFICERS OF HEALTH. REPORT on the HEALTH AND SANITARY CONDITION OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT. Population. The population, estimated to the middle of 1900, was 220,852, being an increase of 9,180 compared with the estimated population in 1899. The following Table shows the population of the District and Sub-Districts for 1900, as well as the three last censuses. Census, 1881. Census, 1891. Census, 1896. Middle of 1900. Clapham 36,380 43,698 46,953 52,932 Putney 13,235 17,771 20,566 22,800 Streatham 21,611 42,958 54,338 65,511 Tooting 3,942 5,784 7,306 10,000 Wandsworth 28,004 46,720 58,101 69,609 Entire Dist. 103,172 156,931 187,264 220,852 The population corrected for internal institutions is estimated at 216,946, compared with 207,766 in 1899. 6 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Births. During the year, 5,754 births were registered, 2,951 of males and 2,803 of females, an increase of 209, compared with last year. In Table I is shown the number of births in each sub-district, as well as the birth-rate and the rate of natural increase. TABLE I. BIRTHS. RATES. Sub-Districts. Males. Females. Total. Birth-rate. Rate of Natural Increase. Clapham 667 611 1278 24.14 8.86 Putney 286 266 552 24.6 12.7 Streatham 798 743 1546 23.8 12.1 Tooting 236 242 478 47.8 23.4 Wandsworth 964 936 1900 28.92 16.89 Whole Borough 2951 2803 5754 26.51 11.89 The birth-rate was 26.51 per 1,000, a decrease of .17 compared with 1899, but is .19 per 1,000 above the mean rate for the last 10 years, which was 26.32. There is considerable difference in the birth-rates of the several parishes, Tooting being 47.8, the highest, and Strcatham 23.8, the lowest. The birth-rate for the Metropolis as a whole was, for the year 1900, 28.5, or 1.99 per 1,000 above the rate for this district. The natural increase, or the excess of births over deaths was 2,612, and the rate of increase 11.89. The average for the preceding 10 years was 12.23, or .34 above the rate for 1900. District. 7 Deaths. The total number of deaths registered was 3,142, 1,544 of males and 1,598 of females, compared with a total of 3,131 in 1899, and 2,855 in 1898. The uncorrected death-rate was 14.22 compared with 15.06 last year, and 13.83 the average of the 10 years preceding. To ascertain the true death-rate, the number of deaths in external institutions has to be added, and those in internal institutions of persons not belonging to the district have to be subtracted. This gives a total of 1,383 deaths, compared with 3,198, in 1899. The corrected death-rate was 14.67, compared with 15.39 in 1899, 14.53 in 1898, and 13.22 in 1897. Table II, shows the rates for each sub-district separately and also for the whole district, corrected for external and internal institutions, and also the uncorrected rates. The death-rate for the whole of London for the year was 18.3 per 1,000 for the 33 great towns 19.5, and for England and Wales 18.3. The death-rate for this district is thus seen to be no less than 3.63 per 1,000, under the death-rate for the Metropolis and for England and Wales partially. Even after correction for age and sex distribution, the death-rate for this district is only 15.66 per 1,000, or 2.64 below the rate for the Metropolis, and for England and Wales. 8 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report.

The total deaths in institutions was 521, compared with 562 in 1899, and 489 in 1898, of these 254 occured in the Union Infirmary, 209 in general and special hospitals, including street and railway accidents and drowning cases, and 58 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Of these 58, 52 occurred from Zymotic diseases, while six occurred from non-Zymotics. The four Tables which follow are the new Tables required by the Local Government Board. Tables I. II. and IV. are Mortality Tables, while Table III. shows the cases of Infectious Disease notified during the year in the whole district at all ages, and at certain groups of ages; it also shows the total number of cases notified in each locality, and the number of cases removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. All these Tables are corrected for internal and internal institutions. In Table I. of the Local Government Board Tables, the birth-rate and the nett death rate do not correspond in the decimal places with the corrected birth and deathrate given above, but this is owing to the fact that in Table I. the rate is calculated from the total population in the Borough wthout deducting the population of the internal institutions. The relative mortality in these institutions of persons from the several sub-districts is as follows:— 1899. 1900.

The total number of deaths from these Zymotic diseases was 471, 78 less than last year and 88 under the corrected decennial average. The number of deaths from Diphtheria was lower than it has been for the last three years, and 32.4 under the corrected decennial average, Whooping Cough also shows a marked decrease, while there is a slight decrease in Scarlet Fever and Measles. Enteric Fever is 5.2 above the average and Diarrhoea 16.4. The death-rate per 1,000 from the above Zymotic diseases was 2.12 per 1,000, compared with 2.6 in 1899, and 2.94 in 1898. Excluding the deaths from Influenza this death-rate was 1.77 per 1,000, while for the Metropolis the same rate was 2.19. If Enteritis be included the corrected number of deaths was 468, and the death-rate 2.12 per 1,000. The next Table shows the death-rate for the last 10 years, as well as that for each of the sub-districts. Tooting showed the highest death-rate, viz. 3.7, and Putney the lowest, viz. 1.6 per 1,000.

Four cases were notified in the Streatham Sub-District, and particulars of these cases will be found in the Local Summary for that Parish. The next Table shows particulars of the Vaccination performed in the whole District, and in the various parishes of the district, for the year 1899. TABLE XII. SUBDISTRICTS.

Deducting the number of children who died unvaccinated viz. 475—the number postponed, insusceptible, and removals, there are still left 980 children unaccounted for. This gives a percentage of 17.7, and it is satisfactory to note that this percentage is lower than the two preceding years, and almost identical with the percentage in 1896. Another very satisfactory fact noticeable in the 19 District. above Table, is that the number of children removed to places unknown, and who cannot be traced, has fallen from 1,086 in 1898 to 351 in 1899. The number of certificates of conscientious objection has increased from 80 to 111, while in 1897 this figure was only 19. It is to be hoped that the figures for the year 1900 will show a still further improvement in the number of children successfully Vaccinated. scarlet Fever. During the year, 672 cases were notified, a decrease compared with 1899 and 1898, the numbers for these years being respectively, 894 and 703. The total number of deaths was 16, an increase of eight compared with the year previous, but 6'7 under the corrected decennial average. Of these 672 cases, 446 or 66'3 were removed to Hospital. The case mortality was 2.3 per cent., which, although much higher than last year, is still under the case mortality for the Metropolis, which was 2.61 per cent. The death-rate per 1,000 from this disease was .073 per 1,000, compared with .08 in the Metropolis, 13 for the 33 great towns, and .12 for England and Wales. The proportion of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 3.09, while for all London this rate was 3.01. 460 notifications of these diseases were Diphtheria and Membranous received, compared with 621 in 1899, 589 croup. in 1898, and 576 in 1897. The largest number of cases occurred in the Parish of Streatham. The number of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 2.12, compared with 2.9 in 1899. For all London this rate was 2.6 per 1,000. 20 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Of the total number of cases, 324 or 70.4 per cent, were removed to Hospital. The total number of deaths was 41, a decrease of 24, compared with 1899, and of 39, compared with the corrected decennial average. The death-rate was ,18 per 1,000, compared with .32 in 1899, while the death-rate for all London was much higher viz. 335—and for England and Wales .29 per 1,000. The case mortality was nearly 9 per cent., the lowest recorded since 1890. The case mortality for the Metropolis was 12-83 per cent. This lessened case mortality is, as has been already stated, due largely to the use of Diphtheria Antitoxin. The greatest number of cases were notified in January, and the smallest in August. Enteric Fever. 153 cases of Enteric Fever were notified, compared with 124 in 1899, and 125 in 1898. The largest number of cases occurred in the Parish of Wandsworth, and the particulars of these will be found in the summary for that Parish. The number of deaths was 26, or 9 above last year, and 5.2 above the corrected decennial average. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population was .7, compared with '93 for the whole of London. The corrected case mortality was 17 per cent, compared with 16.6 for the whole of London. The corrected death-rate from fever was .12 per 21 District. 1,000, compared with .08 in 1899. The rate for all London was .15, and for England and Wales .17. In Clapham, only one death from the above was registered; and this, in a population of 52,000, is almost unique. In Putney also, with 22,000 population, one death also was registered. In Streatham and Wandsworth, the number of deaths was respectively, 9 and 13. On the whole, this death-rate compares very favourably with the death-rate of other localities. Puerperal 15 cases were notified and four deaths Fever. resulted, compared with 13 cases and four deaths in 1899. The number of deaths is 4.5 under the corrected decennial average. Erysipelas. 205 notifications were received, compared with 234 in 1899. Nine deaths occurred compared with the same number in 1899, and 13.5 the corrected average. Measles. 82 deaths were registered during 1900, (7 in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 24 in Streatham, 6 in Tooting, and 32 in Wandsworth) an increase of 23 compared with 1899, but 6.5 below the decennial average, 18 of the deaths were of infants under one year, 59 of children from one to five years, and only five were of persons over five years. The death-rate per 1,000 was .37, compared with .27 in 1899. The death-rate in London for the year was .42 per 1,000. whooping 45 deaths resulted from Whooping Cough, cough. 20 under last year, and 46.4 under the corrected average. As was the case last year all the 22 Medical Officers ot Health Annual Report. deaths were of children under five years of age. The death-rate was .20 per 1,000 compared with .30 in 1899, while for all London the death-rate was .42 per 1,000. Epidemic This disease was again prevalent in the influenza, earlier months of the year, and 87 deaths were registered as resulting from it. This is lower than the number in 1899 which was 122, but it is only a fraction .36 under the corrected decennial average. A large proportion of the deaths 33 out of 87 were of adults over 65 years of age, while 40 deaths occurred between the ages of 25 and 65. The death-rate was .4 per 1,000, while in 1899 this rate was .59. Diarrhœa. From Diarrhoea 156 deaths were registered, compared with 195 in 1899, and with 172 the corrected decennial average. The death-rate was .72 per 1,000, compared with .92 in 1899. The death-rate for the whole of London was .76, for the 33 great towns .94, and for England and Wales .69 per 1,000. This death-rate, although in the main satisfactory, is still higher than it ought to be, and if the number of deaths from Enteritis are added, viz. 84, the number of deaths due to digestive troubles principally occurring in the hot summer months would be 240, and the death-rate l.l per 1,000. For the first time Enteritis is classed as a distinct disease, and in future years it will be easier to make a comparison of the increase or decease of this cause of death. In the new Table issued by the Local Government Board the instructions are as follows:— “Under the heading of Diarrhœa are to be included deaths certified as from Diarrhoea alone or in 23 District. bination with some other cause of ill-defined nature, and also deaths certified as from," Epidemic Enteritis Zymotic Enteritis Epidemic Diarrhoea Summer Diarrhoea Dysentery and Dysenteric Cholera Cholera Nostras (in the absence of Asiatic Cholera.) "Under the heading of Enteritis are to be included those certified as from " Gastro-Enteritis," " MucoEnteritis," and "Gastric Catarrh." These instructions if carried out generally will be of great value for comparative purposes. The following Table shows the Zymotic death-rate for the whole district for the last 3 years. TABLE XIII.

Bacteriological During the year, 44 Bacteriological ExamiExaminations. nations have been made by the Jenner Institute for the diagnosis of Enteric Fever and Diphtheria, and of these, 22 gave a positive, and 22 a negative result. 33 of these examinations were for Diphtheria, and 11 for Enteric Fever. In 1899, 29 examinations were made, and it was hoped that greater advantage would be taken by medical practitioners for confirming their diagnosis, but the increase has not been so great as was anticipated. Many medical men, however, still have these examinations made privately. TABLE XIV. Deaths from Non-Zymotic Diseases. 1890. 1891. 1892. 1893. 1894. 1895 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900.

The numbers shown for the year 1900 are corrected for internal and external institutions, and are thus not comparable with the same figures for previous years. Cancer. 147 deaths occurred from this, and it is noticeable that this year is the first year since 1893 that there has been any diminution in the number. The largest number of deaths from this occurred in the Parish of Clapham, and the smallest number in the Parish of Tooting, Tubercular From disease of a Tubercular nature 374 Diseases. deaths occurred, 267 of these being from Tubercular diseases of the lungs, and 107 from Tubercular diseases of the brain and bowels. Of the deaths from Tubercular diseases of the lungs 231 occurred between the ages of 15 and 65, while of other Tubercular diseases 74 occured under five years of age. The death-rate from all Tubercular diseases was 1.7 per 1,000 and for Phthisis 1'23. Last year the death-rate from Phthisis was 1.34. With reference to the circular issued in April 1899. by the late Board of Works, a large number of these have been distributed by the Sanitary Inspectors, and it is to be hoped that this will bear fruit in educating many to realise the infective nature of the disease, and to take those precautions which are mentioned in the circular. Heart Disease. 339 deaths were registered, compared with 325 in 1899, 142 of these occurred in persons over 65 years of age. 26 Medical Officeis of Health Annual Report. 577 deaths occured from these diseases, 275 Respiratory from Bronchitis, 268 from Pnemonia, 17 organs. from Pleurisy, and 17 from other diseases of the respiratory organs.

From this (including accidents and suicides) 109 deaths occurred, 31 of these took place in Clapham, 13 in Putney, 21 in Streatham, 8 in Tooting, and 36 in Wandsworth. inquests. The next Table shows the number of inquests held during the year, and the verdicts returned. The total number was 186, the same as in 1899. Of these 100 were from Natural, 51 from Accidental, 21 from Suicidal, 4 from Homicidal causes, and in 20 cases open verdicts were returned. TABLE XV. INQUESTS. Clapham. Putney Streatham. Tooting.

CLAPHAM. 1 estimate the population, taking as the Population, principal basis of my calculation the number of inhabited houses, at 52,932 in the middle of 1900. For the purpose of this report the detached portion of Clapham, which really became transferred to Streatham from the 9th of November, is reckoned as a portion of this parish for the whole year, as otherwise it would be impossible to give any correct vital statistics. According to this estimate the population of Clapham has increased since the previous year by 2,932 persons. Births and The number of births registered during 1900 Birth-Rates wag ] 278, a number considerably higher than in any preceding year, and exceeding the decennial average by 16 L. There were 667 births of boys and 611 of girls. The birth-rate was 24.14, which has been exceeded by only four years of the decade, and which almost exactly coincides with the average. The rate for the whole of London was 28.6, which was the lowest recorded rate, that for 1899 being the next lowest. The natural increment of the population, or excess of births over deaths was 469, giving a rate per thousand of 8.86. Deaths and The number of deaths registered in Clapham Death-rate during the year was 703, of which 315 were males and 388 females, and which included 39 deaths of non-parishioners. This number is smaller than in 1899, but except for that year, is greater than in any year of the decade, and exceeded the average by 90. There 33 Parish of Clapham were in addition 145 deaths of Clapham inhabitants in institutions outside its borders, so that the corrected number of deaths for this parish was 809, a number which exceeds the decennial average by 99. The death-rate was 15.47, or uncorrected 13.28. The rate shows a considerable fall on that of 1899 and exceeds the decennial average by 0.11. The following table gives these figures for the last ten years for purposes of comparison. TABLE I. Claphnm Sub-District. Popnlation estimated to middle of each Year. Births.

Small Pox. No case has been reported during the year. This is the fourth year during which there has been none. Only four deaths were recorded in the whole of London from this cause. Diphtheria. This disease was less prevalent in 1900 than in either of the two preceding years, but excepting those two years, the number of cases notified was greater than in any year of the past decade. There were 128 cases notified, a fall of 70 compared with 1899. The proportion of the population attacked by it was 2.41 per thousand in 1899 it was 4.0 per thousand, and in 1898, 3.66. Furthermore, it is seen from the Table above, that by far the largest number of cases were notified in the first two months of the year; 24 in January, and 17 in February, so that the epidemic of 1899 has evidently for the present spent its force. In 1900, there has not been the very marked rise that is usually found in the last quarter of the year, though the cases notified in that quarter were in excess of those in the two preceding ones. 42 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. As regards distribution, it has not been localised in any particular part of the sub-district, but has been spread over the parish fairly evenly. The great influence of personal infection in its spread has again been shown in many instances; for example, the occurrence of second and third cases in houses, when there has been an outbreak, amongst those children who have been exposed to infection, and the same thing among children in the same classes in the elementary schools. As an illustration of the need of special care and precaution in preventing its spread in schools, a small outbreak in connection with the Bonneville Road Board School may be instanced. The school in question is a temporary one, constructed of corrugated iron and not over-crowded. During November, four cases of Diphtheria were notified in boys attending the school. On enquiry it was found that there were other cases amongst scholars in the same room who lived outside Clapham Parish, and as to whom I had, of course, had no notification. It also appeared that all the boys had their seats in the same part of the room. Suspecting that there might be a boy in an infectious condition in this part of the school room, I, with the Assistant to the Medical Officer of the School Board, examined the throats of a considerable number of boys. We found two with throats suggestive of Diphtheria, and clearly infectious. These boys were sent home, and not allowed to come back to school till certified as free from infection by their doctors. Excepting one further case, that of a boy, who was already ill at this time and was notified two days subsequently, there were no more cases reported in connection with this school. These boys looked ill at the time, and would no doubt have been kept at home by parents belonging to a more educated and careful class. This confirms my opinion that much more could be done in preventing the spread of this disease by the examination of children attending elementary schools by a medical man. Great pressure, Parish of Clapham. 43 also, is put on parents to send children to school, and this, no doubt, at times leads to the spread of infectious illness, though it is impossible to find fault with the system of looking up the absentees promptly and persistently. With regard to deaths from Diphtheria, there was a great and satisfactory fall in 1900. Only seven deaths occurred, as compared with 25 in 1899. We have to go back to 1891 to find as small a number. The death-rate per cent, of cases reported was only 5'4, a remarkable fall from preceding years as shown by the following figures Percentage of Deaths to cases reported. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 28.2 30.9 16.9 17.6 23.1 14.4 13.0 5.4 This shows that Diphtheria was remarkably milder, besides being less prevalent in this than in former years. It is not possible to say how much of this difference may be due to the reporting of a large number of cases of mild throat illness, but my experience shows that this is the case to a considerable extent. Tho reliance that is now placed on the finding of the bacillus supposed to be the cause of Diphtheria in the throats of patients, as being absolute proof of the existence of the disease, certainly tends to increase the number of cases reported. We should consider this a good thing, and we may to some extent modify our views as to the dread import of the term "Diphtheria." It must also be recognised that the treatment of Diphtheria is now greatly improved, and some of the credit of these figures should rightly be attributed to this. There is a remarkable difference in the mortality from this disease between Clapham and the whole of London. The death-rate per thousand in Clapham was 0T32, and in the Metropolis 0.335, or less than half as great. 44 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Very great advantage has been taken of hospital accommodation in the treatment of the disease, 88 cases having been removed, or 68.7 per cent, of the total. This is rather below the proportion in the preceding year when 69.7 per cent, were removed. It is not always possible to find definite sanitary defects in cases of Diphtheria, but in 30 of the infected houses, which were all carefully examined, serious conditions were found. Drains were defective in 22, cisterns dirty in 7, and walls wet in 1. It should be added that in only two cases was a certificate subsequently received from the hospitals stating that the patient was not suffering from this disease, thougn it is now a regulation of the Asylums Board that the Medical Officer of Health shall be notified from the hospitals when that is the case. The provision of the Board for the examination of material from suspected throats has not been largely taken advantage of during the year, only four cases having been examined of which two were reported to be Diphtheria, and two not proved to be such. Scarlet Fever. There was no great diminution in the prevalence of this disease in 1900, the number of cases reported being If less than in 1899, and exactly the same as in 1898. The table above shows that the number of cases has not fallen below this figure in any year since 1891. It would appear that this is the lowwater mark even in non-epidemic years, in spite of the efforts that are made to prevent it. This is a serious matter from the point of view of interference with education, if from no other point of view, as each case represents an absence from school of many weeks. The mortality is very small, only four deaths having occurred, Parish of Clapham. 45 a percentage on the cases of 2.58. The death-rate per thousand of the population was 0.075, and for the whole of London it was but little more, 0.078. The hospitals were largely made use of, 97 cases being removed, or 62 per cent, of the total, which, however, is a slightly smaller proportion than in 1899. But little can be said as to the cause of these numerous cases of Scarlet Fever. It is not common to find persons infected by reported cases, though of course a certain small proportion of this recognisable infection does occur. The largest number of cases notified cannot be traced to a known pre-existing case, so that one is driven to the opinion that the evil really is that unrecognised illness is the main cause of its spread. Of course the extreme mildness of the disease is the great reason for cases being missed, because it often involves no very marked bodily illness, and may be passed over as a severe cold, as has been the case in my experience. The rash may be apparent only for a few hours and may not have been noticed, and consequently no medical man called in. Then the child, after perhaps a few days at home, goes back to school, and other cases occur. It does not appear that our present system of prevention is able to cope with these circumstances, and if it is worth while to stamp out the disease it appears that the only way would be to appoint medical inspectors in connection with elementary schools, whose duty it would be to visit any child absent from any illness, and whose certificate should be necessary before the child is allowed to return to school. The enormous sum spent annually in disinfecting, and in isolating reported cases does not lead to the result that was hoped for, so that the question is being raised as to how far the expenditure is justifiable. The answer of course is that a very great control is, even with our present means, obtained over the spread of 46 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. infectious illness, and undoubtedly there would be a very great deal more of it, if less were done and less money spent. One thing is I think certain, and that is that there is but little, if any, wilful concealment of infectious disease, the dread of removal to hospital and disinfecting procedures, which was a formidable difficulty in former years, having largely vanished from the popular mind, so that, with the progress of education and sense of responsibility among parents, we may hope that the question of prevention of infection in connection with overlooked cases will solve itself. Enteric Fever. There were only 19 cases notified during the year, a much smaller number than in the two preceding ones, and less than in any year of the decade. There was only one death recorded, also a remarkable circumstance and unprecedented in recent years. This may be regarded as most satisfactory evidence of the good sanitary condition of the parish as a whole, the more so as several of the cases were probably contracted outside its boundaries (two, for instance, coming home ill from the continent, and several from staying in various places at the time when the infection was probably received). Careful examination of the drains, etc, in infected houses showed that there was some drainage defect in seven of them. There was less Enteric Fever in London generally during 1900 than in recent years, the deathrate per thousand being 0'13 as against 0" 18 in 1899. The death- rate in Clapham was only 0-01. Puerperal Fever. There were six cases notified, and there were three deaths, both being one above the preceding year. Steps were taken in these cases to disinfect and prevent the possibility of the infection being conveyed to other patients by the nurses. Parish of Clapham. 47 Erysipelas. There were 39 cases notified, a marked fall on previous years, and less than in any year of the decade. No deaths were referred to this cause, and most of the cases were of a trivial kind. Measles. There were only seven deaths from Measles compared with 27 in 1899 In no year of this decade have there been so few deaths, the nearest approach to it being in 1897, when there were 16. There was in all probability less Measles during the year, besides being of a less fatal type. Whooping Cough. There were 13 deaths referred to Ibis cause, compared with five in lb99 and 18 in 1898. This disease, like Measles, is allowed to spread itself unchecked and the "whoop" is to be frequently heard in waiting rooms of hospitals and dispensaries. Diarrhœa and Dysentery. There were only 29 deaths due to this cause, a comparatively small number, and less than in any year since 1894. The summer and autumn were not such as to cause any excessive amount of Diarrhœa. Influenza There were 30 deaths referred to this cause, a smaller number lhan in 1899, and five less than the decennial average corrected for increase of population. There was a considerable epidemic of the disease in the first quarter of the year, but it was probably of a generally milder type than has been experienced in former years. It is impossible to lay much stress on the number of these deaths, however, as all are due to some complication as a secondary cause, and it is quite uncertain as to what proportion of deaths from diseases of the lungs, for instance, should properly be included among these, as it depends on the more or less accidental use of the word Influenza on the certificate as the primary cause of death. 48 Medical Officers of Health AnnuaI Report.

There were but few deaths under this heading, and tbey do not differ materially from former years. Cancer and other Tumours. There were 50 deaths from these Tumours, or two above the corrected decennial average. It must be remembered, however, that a considerable number of deaths from this cause occur in the Home Parish of Clapham. 49 for the Dying; in 1900, there were 11 such deaths of persons not belonging to Clapham, which are included in the 50. This materially reduces the number and makes it less than the average. The Home for the Dyin? has recently been moved into larger premises, and the deaths are therefore more numerous. The figures therefore do not give any support to the opinion frequently expressed that cancerous diseases are increasing. Tubercular Diseases. There were 108 deaths from all the different forms of Tubercle, including consumption. This was 18 above the corrected average, and a decidedly larger number than in any year of this decade. The Influence of the Home for the Dying must be remembered here again, there having been 21 deaths of non-parishioners in it from Tubercular diseases during the year, which was an increase on former years. The death-rate per 1,000 living was 2.04, or slightly greater than in the last few years. The death-rate for Phthisis or Consumption was 1.49, the corresponding rate for the whole of London being 1.7. The Clapham death-rate for Phthisis was above that for the whole Wandsworth District which was 1.16 only, but this would be expected, as Clapham is far more densely populated than other portions of the district. The rate is almost exactly the same as that for Battersea, and considerably below that for Lambeth. The claim to place diseases of this group, and especially Consumption, in the list of preventible diseases is now generally conceded, so that it is not satisfactory to have to record an increase of mortality from them. It should be pointed out, however, that most tubercular illnesses run a somewhat long course, and that the actual period when death occurs (perhaps years after the beginning of the illness) is often determined by outside K 50 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report causes, such as an inclement season or the prevalence of Influenza. Therefore, there may be an unusually large number of deaths in a particular year, balanced by a smaller number in the preceding and succeeding years. It is to be expected that as Clapham has tended year by year to become more completely urban in character, and the open spaces more completely covered by houses, that the death-rate from tubercular diseases will rise. On looking back, however, to the early days of the administration of the District Board of Works, it is found that this is not so. In the first year, 1856, the death-rate for Consumption in Clapham was 2 96 per thousand, which is more than double that for 1900. Diseases of the Nervous System. These deaths were only 62, or 14 below the decennial average. The number in this class has shown considerable variation in the ten years, but has not shown any tendency to increase. Diseases of the Organs of Circulation-Heart, &c. These deaths have tended to increase. They numbered 77, and were 10 above the corrected average. Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. The deaths were four above the average, and numbered 136. The large number of deaths probably had relation to the epidemic of Influenza above referred to, the greatest number being in the first quarter of the year when Influenza was prevalent. Diseases of the Digestive Organs. There wore only 30 deaths from this cause or six below the average. Diseases of the Urinary Organs. They were 19 in number, and corresponded to the average. Premature birth, &c. There were 66 deaths, and they were six above the average. Parish of Clapham. 51 Old Age. The deaths were 28, in which no specific cause was given besides the old age. These were six above the average. Violence. Deaths due to various forms of violence were 19, or one above the average. The deaths from all the diseases of a Non-Zymotic nature, taken as a whole, were much above the average, and if they were not balanced by the very small number of deaths in the Zymotic Class, would have produced a high general death-rate. Inquests. The number held during the year was 31, less than half the number in the previous year. The accidents and suicides were almost the same in number; natural causes, half the number; and wilful murder an increase. Males. Females. Total.

Only five deaths were registered on the authority of the Coroner without medical certificates or inquest. General Sanitary Proceedings 1900. Disinfection During the year, 300 infected rooms in 190 houses were fumigated with sulphur. In addition, the infected rooms in 10 houses were certified by the medical practitioners in attendance to have been disinfected to their satisfaction. 248 lots of bedding, &c., have been disinfected by the contractor. 249 notices were served to cleanse and strip 276 rooms, and 74 rooms Avere cleansed by the Board's employees. Unsound Food. The following articles were destroyed as being unsound, and unfit for human food, 4 baskets of cherries, and 20 baskets of strawberries, 5 boxes of bloaters, 1 box of cod and hake. Underground Rooms. Only four underground rooms were known to be separately occupied in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health Act. They were regularly inspected. One other instance was found that did not comply with the requirements; the occupiers moved out without notice, and the premises ceased to be separately occupied. Workshops. The number on the register was 236, and they were regularly inspected. Cleansing was required in 27, eight water-closets were altered or repaired, two workroom floors, two drains, three yard pavings, and one water fitting were repaired, two workrooms were ventilated, and one case of overcrowding dealt with. Parish of Clapham. 53 Black Smoke. There were eight cases of black smoke under observation, and five notices were served. The offences were not repeated, and further action was not necessary. Houses Let in Lodgings. These were inspected twice during the year, and the necessary cleansing and repairing has been carried out, after a number of preliminary and statutory notices had been served. Bakehouses. The Bakehouses were inspected twice during the year, and were 47 in number. Limewhiting was required in 25 instances in April, and 26 in October. These were cleansed and limewhited without notice. Cowhouses and Slaughter-houses. The Cowhouses, Milkshops and Slaughterhouses have been regularly inspected since the formation of the new Borough Council. The Cowhouses and Slaughter-houses, and one milkshop have been cleansed and limewhited, one dairy drain repaired and altered; and in the case of one milkshop proper utensils have been provided for keeping milk in. General Nuisances- During the year 6,299 houses and premises were inspected, including 1,196 house to house inspections, and the number of nuisances dealt with amounted to 4,571, of these 3,397 were abated on the service of notice, and 1,174 without 2,131 notices were served, viz—1,875 preliminary, and 256 statutory. Unclassified Nuisances. In addition to the nuisances given in the Table on page 00, the following nuisances were some of those dealt with, 331 new water-closet apparatus were fixed in place of old ones, two water-closet apartments ventilated, 99 old soilpipes replaced by new and 39 54 Medical Officer of Health Annual Report. repaired, 41 ventilating pipes repaired, 2 new urinals constructed, 3 privies abolished, 27 new manure pits constructed, 133 new ashpits provided, 71 leaky water fittings repaired, 9 drinking water supplies laid on from the main, 10 new sinks fixed, 39 new baths and lavatory basins provided, 14 baths and lavatories repaired, 5 cases of burning refuse, 6 cases of stagnant water, 9 cases of rats, 9 houses with water in the basements, 38 damp houses remedied, ceilings of 32 houses, floors of 47, walls of 16, windows of 24, steps of 3, and fire-grates of 3 were repaired, leaky gas fittings, school yard paved, station yard cleansed, dirty bedding, fish offal, cases of animals kept so as to be a nuisance (fowls 2, ducks 2) cottage floor constructed of old wood street paving blocks remade with fresh timber.

Custom and Inland Revenue Acts. Certificates for exemption from or abatement of inhabited house duty were granted in the case of 15 buildings comprising 73 flats. In several cases it was necessary to insist on certain work being first carried out to bring them up to the proper standard of healthiness. Police Court Proceedings.

As this is the last year of the existence of the Board of Works for the Wandsworth District, it is interesting to contrast the condition of the Parish of Clapham with that obtaining in 1856, when the important work of the Board was commenced. The population was then 18,200, now it is 52,932. Comparing the rates for the first ten years, 1856 to 1865, with the last ten, 1891 to 1900, we find a mean death. rate of 17.2, reduced to a mean rate of 13.28, and a zymotic rate of 3.3 reduced to 2.21. In these early years, too, we find records of deaths from Typhus Eever, from Cholera, &c., which, have now quite dropped out from our Tables. This means that if the old conditions had prevailed, some 211 more persons would have died in 1900 than actually did die, and 53 more persons would have died from zymotic diseases. In the early reports of the Medical Officer of Health for Clapham, there are repeated references to the absence of proper sewers, the poluting of the soil, the impure drinking water from wells and pools (there being then no public supply generally available), so that we find it difficult to realise the conditions under which the people of Clapham then existed, though only 44 years ago. Clearly the able administration of the Board of Works has not been without avail, not only in increasing the comforts of the inhabitants, but in preventing many deaths, and in increasing the average duration of life. In taking leave of my duties of Medical Officer of Health after many years service, I would desire to express 57 Parish of Clapham. my sense of the courtesy and kindness with which I have always been treated by all the members of the late Board of Works, and especially by the members of the Clapham Local Committee of the Board. My thanks are also due to my colleague, the Surveyor for Clapham, who has always given me ready help, and to Inspectors Fairchild, Nurconibe, and Crabbe, for their able work. OLIVER FIELD, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Clapham, PUTNEY & ROEHAMPTON. I estimate the population of Putney and Roe. hampton to be 22,800, in the middle of the year 1900. This estimate is obtained by calculating the increase since the last census at the same ratio as obtained during the previous intercensal period. In all probabiliy this estimate will be found to fall considerably under the true population as determined by the census of 1901. Births and During the year, 552 births were registered Birth.rates. 0f wi]jch 286 were males and 266 females. This is equal to a birth.rate of 24'2 per 1,000 per annum, and is slightly below the decennial average, which is 24 6. Deaths and 264 deaths were registered in the sub. Death.rates district during the year, 134 males and 130 females. This is equal to a death.rate of 115 per 1,000 per annum, and is .9 below the decennial average. In order to obtain the corrected death.rate, it is necessary to add to the deaths registered within the sub.district the number of deaths of parishioners registered in 59 Sub.district of Putney and Roehampton. lying institutions, and to subtract the number of deaths of non.parishioners which were registered within our area. The corrected death.rate thus obtained is 13.3. TABLE I. Birth and Death Rates. YEAR. Births. Birth.rate. Deaths from all Causes. Death.rate.

During 1900, 25 notifications were received, compared with 123 during 1899, and 47 during 1898. The type of the disease was mild. No fatal case occurred. The number of cases notified was equal to one per 1,000 of the population There has been no epidemic, of the disease at any time throughout the year. More cases were notified during the month of March than at any other time. 26 cases were notified, and 21 of these were Diphtheria removed. hospital, five eases were treated at their homes and of these two proved fatal. Four fatal cases occurred among the 21 which were removed to hospital. This is equal to a case mortality of 23 per cent. During the previous year the case mortality was 21 per cent. The number of cases notified corresponded to 1.1 per 1,000 of the population, and the mortality to .25. Nearly all the cases occurred during the spring and winter months. Enteric Fever 11 cases were notified and six were removed to hospital. One of the hospital cases ended fatally. This gives a case mortality of 9 per cent. The mortality from Enteric Fever was 04 per 1,000. 70 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Measles and 15 deaths resulted from Measles and whooping cough. Whooping Cough, 13 from Measles and two from Whooping Cough. All these deaths occurred, with one exception, among children under five years of age The death-rate from these two diseases was .6 per 1,000. Small Pox. No case notified. puerpera Fever No case notified. The mortality from this disease was very much less than during the preceding two years. Judging from my own experience the type of the disease was milder than we have been accustomed to. Diarrhoea and 16 deaths occurred under this heading. The Dysentery, mortality was '7 per 1,000. Deaths from Non.Zymotic Diseases. 225 deaths were registered from diseases of a Non. Zymotic character. cancer and 14 deaths were registered under this heading, other Tumours. This is equal to a mortality of '6 per 1,000. I am glad to be able to record a diminished mortality under this heading. The tendency for several years has been for these diseases to increase, judging by the increased mortality. 27 deaths were registered under Ibis heading Phthisis and ° ® other Tubercular the greatest number since 1890. The Diseases mortality was IT per 1,000. 71 Sub.district of Putney and lloehampton. Nervous There is a diminution in the mortality arising Diseases. from these diseases. 26 deaths were registered, which gives a death-rate per 1,000 of 1.1. circulatory The numbers and rates were practically the Diseases. same as under Nervous diseases, and were considerably below those of the previous year. Respiratory There is a great fall in the mortality under Diseases. this heading, only 39 deaths were registered compared with 50 during 1899. The difference is probably due to the fact that Influenza was less prevalent, and the type of the disease not so severe. Digestive Under this heading there was a fall in the Diseases. mortality, 37 compared with 47 deaths. The mortality was 1.1 per 1,000. TABLE XI. COMPARATIVE TABLE OF NON-ZYMOTIC MORTALITY.

The number has increased since last year from 2,740 to 3,108. This is exceedingly satisfactory, and is as it should be. The number of inhabited houses is constantly increasing and requires constantly more inspection. 658 preliminary, and 46 statutory notices were served. Two cases were investigated by the magistrate and, in both, compulsory orders were obtained. 69 rooms were disinfected after infectious disease, and in 46 cases the bedding was stoved. Overcrowding was abated in five cases. In one case a closing order was obtained under the Public Health Act. Houses let in The Bye-Laws, in regard to these houses, are Lodgings, practically non-operative in this sub-district. 73 Sub.district of Putney and lloehampton. In my last annual report, I stated that, by way of experiment, I put certain houses in Floss Street under their operation. The landlord, however, made such structural alterations in the houses in question, that each flat became a separate tenement with a separate door, so that they could no longer remain under the Bye-Laws. 85 unclassified nuisances were dealt with and were as follows:— 10 New gully traps fixed to drain in yard. 32 Water fittings repaired to prevent soakage of walls. 7 Cases where animals were kept so as to be a nuisance. 26 Rotten wood flooring removed. 10 Joints of soil pipe re-caulked. All the bakehouses have been frequently inspected, and found in a satisfactory condition. The necessary cleansing and limewashing has been done twice during the year. The workshops have been inspected and found in a satisfactory condition. The fishmongers shops have been frequently inspected, and the offal has been removed in accordance with the Bye-laws. I have again to record my thanks to all who have been associated with myself in carrying out the sanitary work of the district. Wm. Y. ORR, M.B., C.M., D P.H., Medical Officer of Health for Putney STREATHAM. Popuiatio At the time of writing this Report upon the Public Health and Sanitary Condition of the Parish of Streatham, the census figures concerning the population existing on the first day of April, 1901, are not available, and, although they would doubtless form the basis of a more correct estimate, it is necessary to again assume that the annual increase of population during the previous intercensal period has been maintained, which would be productive of a population, during the year under report, of 65,511 persons, and upon this figure the various mortality and other rat es will be calculated. Births and The number of births registered during Birth.-rate. the year was, 1,546, of these 798 were of males and 748 of females, the sex distribution as usual being remarkably equal. The birth-rate was equal to 23.6 per 1,000 per annum, being the highest rate recorded since the year 1894, although slightly below the average of the past ten years which was equal to 23'8 per 1,000. Deaths and The deaths recorded in Streatham during the Death.rates. year numbered 759, those of males numbering 359, and of females 400, giving a death-rate equal to 11.5 per . ,000 per annum, that for the preceding ten years being equal to 11.3 per 1,000. Parish of Streatham. 75 The corrected death-rate, produced by excluding 38 deaths of non-parishioners occurring in the district, and including those of 104 parishioners occurring outside in the various public institutions of the Metropolis, and producing a corrected total of 825, is thereby equal to 12.5 per 1,000 of the population, compared with 13.0 per 1,000 during the preceding year. The number of deaths in the corrected total includes 370 males and 455 females. Natural The natural increase, otherwise the excess increase. of the births over the number of deaths registered in the Sub-district was equal to 787, representing 12.1 per 1,000 of the population. The sex distribution was, males 439, and females 348. Table I. gives the number of births and deaths, birthrates, and the death-rates during the past sixteen year. table i. Birth and Death Hates.

Deaths in outlying Institutions The deaths of "residents" in outlying metro- politan institutions numbered 101, compared with 110 during the preceding year. The deaths included those of 49 males and 55 females. Diphtheria was, as usual, the largest contributor to the zymotic mortality, the deaths from that disease numbering 11, all of which occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Scarlet Fever and Enteric Fever each also contributed four deaths. In the institutions of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union, 36 deaths took place; 44 in general and special hospitals, 22 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and two elsewhere. The following Table, which indicates the nature of the cause of death, the age and sex of the deceased, and the character of the institution in which death occurred, includes all ''residents" dying in outlying general and special hospitals, within the Metropolis, and the Union Infirmary, &c. Parish of Streatham. 77 The original "Table III." of former reports has this year, for the first time, been replaced with one inserted by direction of the Local Government Board, and contains several new columns, some, on the other hand, being omitted.

Moreover venereal diseases are tabulated, they being formerly included under "other constitutional diseases." In regard to this disease it is highly improbable that the mortality statistics ever shew a correct record, inasmuch as owing to the present system of registration of deaths, sentiment frequently prevails, and some secondary disease is certified as the cause. From the disease in question, two deaths only were recorded during the year and these in infants under one year of age It will also be seen that the table deals with corrected statistics, i.e.—the deaths of "non-residents" occurring in the district are eliminated, and those of "residents" occurring outside the district are included. Table IV. is also newly introduced by direction of the Local Government Board. These tables being used in all districts greatly facilitate comparison by reason of the uniformity in tabulation. This table is almost a combination of Tables I. and V., but, in view of the fact that different periods are included in the respective tables, they are still retained for comparative purposes.

The deaths of infants registered in the district under one year of age numbered, during the year, 184, being equal to 118 per 1,000 of births registered. This shews a great reduction upon the preceding year which was equal to 140 per 1,000. The average for the preceding ten years was 116 per 1,000, so that, although satisfactory in a measure, the record for the year is slightly below the standard of the preceding decennial period.

There were in all 94 deaths recorded from this class of disease in the district, being remarkably low compared with preceding years. Diarrhoea was the largest contributor to zymotic mortality, Parish of Streatham. 63 The deaths from diseases of the zymotic class yielded a percentage of 12 3 of the deaths recorded from all causes. The death-rate from the seven principal diseases was equal to 1.4 per 1,000 of the population. The corrected death-rate from all zymotic diseases was equal to 1.7 per 1,000. Before proceeding to further discuss the subject of zymotic mortality, it would be well to introduce the subject of sickness from these diseases. lleliable information under this head can only bo obtained in regard to those diseases which are notifiable under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, and these include Smallpox, Scarlet Fever or Scarlatina, Diphtheria and Membranous Croup, Cholera, Erysipelas, Typhus, Enteric, Continued, Relapsing and Puerperal Fevers; and, by an order of the Local Government Board coming into force during the year under report, Bubonic Plague also. From all notifiable diseases, 472 cases of sickness occurred during the year, Scarlet Fever contributing the largest number to the total, followed next by Diphtheria. A new table has also here been introduced by direction of the Local Government Board, and, for the first time, the cases are classified under the various age periods, the largest number occurring between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The Table (No. VII.) also gives further particulars as to the number of cases removed to hospital, the latter being principally the institutions of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. The percentage of removals was equal to 67. The various diseases will each be found separately discussed in the succeeding pages. For the purposes of comparison, the following shows the number of cases notified during G 2 84 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. each of the last 10 years:—1891, 185; 1892, 311; 1893, 483; 1894, 344; 1895,386; 1896,385; 1897,454; 1898, 443; 1899, 488; 1900, 472.

Parish of Streatham. 85 Streatham, in common with the Metropolis, smaLL pox visited by Small Pox during the year, four cases occurring, all of which were promptly removed to hospital and immediate action taken in the matters of disinfection, vaccination and quarantine, which were effective in preventing the further spread of the disease. The age distribution of the cases was as set out in Table VII. The first case occurred on the 12th July, at Birkbeck Road, being an isolated case, and, owing to quarantine, etc., was effectually dealt with. A new outbreak occurred on the 28th August, viz., at Wellfield Road, and upon the following day another member of the family was attacked An investigation of these two cases attached great suspicion to importation by a sailor who appeared to have been exposed to infection. The fourth aud last case occurred in the High Road. Streatham, on September 4th. It is a matter for much congratulation that the disease was so effectually eradicated. Elaborate measures were adopted in all these cases to arrest the spread of the disease, and the new Shelter in Larch Road was requisitioned with great advantage during the process of disinfection. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 184 cases Diphtheria and two of branous Croup were notified during the year, of which 133 were removed to hospital. The number of cases notified shows a very satisfactory reduction upon the number notified during the previous year, viz., 217. The deaths from this disease numbered 14, of which 11 occurred in hospital and three at the homes of the patients. This is the lowest mortality recorded for many years. In the year 1899 the deaths numbered 15; in 1898, 23; and in 1897, 26. The largest number of cases occurred amongst children between the ages of 5 and 15, viz , 90; and 69 between the ages of one and five. 86 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. This disease, for statistical purposes, covers Cholera. . that form of Cholera known as Asiatic, and from which this country has not for some years been in serious danger of invasion, nor have any cases occurred in this Sub-district. Cases of English Cholera have occurred from time to time during the summer months, but this type of the disease is synonymous with Diarrhoea among which such cases are included. 37 cases of Erysipelas were notified during Erysipelas. the year, 26 of which occurred amongst adults between the ages of 25 and 65. The number of cases notified at all ages during the preceding year was 45. One death only was recorded. 199 cases of Scarlet Eever were notified Scarlet Fever. during the year, showing a very slight increase upon the number occurring in 1899, viz., 196. Between the ages of 5 and 15 years the majority of the cases occurred, namely, 123, and between the ages of one and five, 41. A large percentage of the cases were removed to hospital, viz., 148 out of 199 cases notified. The mortality was remarkably low, only four deaths occurring, and these in hospital. In common with the Metropolis grenerally, Enteric Fever. this disease has been more than usually prevalent during the year under report, 41 cases having been notified, compared with 28, 29, 26, 27 and 36 respectively during the preceding five years. The largest number of cases occurred between the ages of 15 and 25 years. 20 of the cases were removed to hospital. Nine fatal cases were recorded, five occurring at the homes of the patients and four in hospital. This mortality is higher than in previous years, but is not excessive in view of the greater prevalence of the disease. Parish of Streatham. 87 continued Fever One case of Continued Fever occurred during the year from which the patient recovered. This disease is a kind of low fever and of uncertain origin. puerperal Fever From Puerperal Fever four cases were notified, the whole of them being treated at their homes. No fatal cases were recorded. In all cases the names of the nurses in attendance were ascertained, and they were cautioned as to attending any further midwifery cases for a period of at least six weeks. The disease is clearly of a preventible character, being due to septic poisoning from want of absolute cleanliness. In view, however, of the fact that 1,546 births took place during the year the proportion of puerperal cases is very small. The occurrence of cases of Bubonic Plascue Plague. at Glasgow, and other isolated parts of this country, has resulted in much agitation amongst those responsible for the public health, and elaborate precautions have been generally adopted for preventing the spread of the disease and immediately dealing with outbreaks. In September last, by an order of the Local Government Board, the disease was made compulsorily notifiable, and subject to such regulations, &c., as apply to those infectious diseases included in section 62 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The London County Council has provided accommodation for keeping suspicious cases under observation, and for the bacteriological examination of suspected matter, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board has made the necessary arrangements for treating cases Fortunately none have occurred in this part and the danger of such seems rapidly to be diminishing, nevertheless it behoves those responsible for such to continue to adopt every precaution. 88 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The following Table gives the number of cases of infectious disease notified, removed to hospital, and the mortality therefrom both in the hospitals and at home. table viii. DISEASES.

I have again to refer to the difficulties of dealing with this disease in the absence of compulsory notification. This subject has, however, been recently under the consideration of the London County Council, and it is possible that eventually the general provisions affecting notifiable infectious diseases may also be made to apply to Measles in some degree. 22 deaths were recorded in the sub-district during the year, and two in outlying institutions. This is a much larger number than during the preceding year, but Parish of Streatham. 89 compares very favourably with 26 during the year 1898. For the past ten years the mortality has been higher during the alternative years and is a point worthy of particular comment, although no satisfactory explanation can be given of the coincidence. During the year more than half the cases, namely, 14, occurred between the ages of one and five years. Diarrhœa. During the year, 34 deaths from this disease occurred in the sub-district, and one in outlying institutions, representing a large reduction compared with the mortality of the previous year. With five exceptions, the whole of the cases occurred amongst infants under one year of age, and most of them were recorded during the months of July, August and September, being the months of the year when the temperature is highest and thereby milk, &c., rapidly decomposes, and thus the mortality is found to be considerably higher amongst hand-fed infants. The desirability of boiling milk and withholding all food in the least degree decomposed, cannot be too strongly urged upon parents and others having the feeding of infants. The number of deaths from Influenza perse Influenza. was considerably lower during the year under report, 18 deaths being recorded in Streatham therefrom, although there were many other cases in which it was a secondary cause associated with Bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. There is reason to believe that the term "Influenza" has been somewhat too freely used in the past in diagnosing diseases of the latter class. 14 of the deaths were amongst adults of the age of 25 years and upwards. The corrected number of deaths from this disease was 16. 90 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. whooping cough. This disease likewise showed considerable reduction in mortality during the year, 11 deaths only being recorded, compared with 25 during the preceding year. Eight of the deaths were of infants under one year of age, and three between the ages of one and five years. TABLE IX. Comparative Table of Non-zymotic Mortality.

The foregoing Table classifies the mortality from the several non-zymotic diseases registered in Streatham during the past ten years. With the exception of diseases of the Tubercular class, they are more or less of an uncontrollable character from a public health aspect, and therefore a minute discussion is neither practicable nor of much value Deaths from Tubercular diseases compare favourably with previous Parish of Streatham. 91 years, in view of the increased population, the number being four more than during the year 1899, and nine less than during 1898. Diseases of the Local and Developmental classes show no great, variation from averages of past years, the greatest being in diseases of the Nervous system. Diseases of the Respiratory system show an increase upon the previous year but a reduction upon the next preceding year. Although a better record is shown during the year under report, a sad waste of life continues to be due to premature birth, low vitality and congenital defects. The number of deaths under one year of Ages at Death. age was 184; under five 238; and, under 25, 298. In respect of each of these age periods great reductions are shown compared with the previous year. The "corrected" age classifications will be found upon reference to Table III. From old age, 57 deaths were recorded senile Decay. in Streatham tham representing 7 .5 per cent of the mortality from all causes, being in exactly the same proportion as during the preceding year. Most of the deaths were amongst females, 42 amongst that sex being recorded and the remainder, numbering 15, amongst males. At the ages of 65 years and upwards 237 deaths were recorded. The usual tabulated statement showing the distribution amongst the sexes, and the various age periods of deaths of persons at 70 years of age and upwards registered in Streatham is here given. 92 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. table x.

Parith of Streatham. 93 sanitary operations, As usual the detailed summary of Sanitary operations performed during the year will be found upon reference to Table XVI. in the combined report. The number of inspections made by the staff during the year was, 2,438, and as the result of such inspections it was found necessary to serve 1,485 notices to remedy Sanitary defects. As I have frequently mentioned in previous reports, a very large portion of the inspectors' time is occupied in the supervision of drainage work, in respect of which 13,496 visits were made, and the test applied in 4,550 instances. Realising how seriously this important work has interfered of late in that most essential of Sanitary operations namely, houseto-house inspection, a Sanitary Inspector was appointed to devote his time solely to this work, and in order to show the results of twelve months experience under this arrangement, a few figures relative to the performance during the year ended, March, 1901, will be of interest and value. From house-to-house, 2,030 premises were inspected; and, in consequence of defects discovered therein, 1,832 preliminary notices were served, the following being some of the more numerous and important defects thereby remedied:— 1,045 rooms were cleansed and repaired, 456 water-closet pans were renewed; 293 cisterns were cleansed, covered, or repaired and a similar number of dustbins provided; 217 water-closets were cleansed or repaired; 207 rain water-pipes were disconnected from drains; 187 new soil and ventilating pipes were fixed; and, in addition to many other sanitary improvements effected, 84 cisterns under bedroom floors were abolished. This record most clearly and amply justifies the appointment of the additional officer. The operations performed by the other inspectors will, as already referred to, be found set out elsewhere 94 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. in the combined Report. In considering the number of' defects remedied it must also be borne in mind that many other unclassified works have been carried out voluntarily by those responsible in the matter without the necessity of notices being served. Disinfection of 471 rooms in 407 houses was carried out by the agency of suphurous acid gas, and in 222 instances bedding, &c. was submitted to superheated steam. The Bake-houses, which during the year Bake-houses. c J numbered 38, were kept under close supervision, and the usual half-yearly special inspections made to see that the necessary cleansing and lime-whiting had been carried out, and, where necessary, notices were served. cow-houses and Slaughter-house The importance of strict sanitary conditions being maintained in Cow-houses and Slaughterhouses cannot be over-estimated. There are now in Streatham four licensed Cow-houses and five licensed Slaughter-houses, and each of these was kept under frequent observation. Public Mortuary. number of bodies admitted to the mortuary shows a slight increase upon the preceding year, 35 having been admitted, compared with 31 during 1899. Police court Proceedings. In respect of contravention of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or of bye-laws made thereunder, it was found necessary during the year to take magisterial proceedings in 27 instances. Of these, 15 were prosecutions under the smoke prevention sections of the Act, against the London, Brighton Parish of Streatham. 95 and South Coast Railway, and in seven instances fines of 40s. and 2s. costs were inflicted, or in all, £14 14s. The remaining eight summonses were adjourned sine die. In four instances new houses were allowed to be occupied without certificates as to water supply, having been previously obtained from the Sanitary Authority, and summonses were issued, which resulted in a fine of 10s. and 2s. costs being inflicted in each case. For fixing a water-closet and soil-pipe without giving the notice required under the bye-laws of the London County Council one summons was issued, and a nominal fine of 1s. and 2s. costs inflicted. The object of the notice required under the bye-laws is to ensure that no drainage work shall be carried out except under the direct supervision of the staff of the Sanitary Authority. To enforce compliance with notices served to remedy defective drains, two summonses were issued, in each of which "magistrate's orders" were obtained and the defendants ordered to pay 6s. costs. Under the bye-laws of the London County Council, regulating the removal of fish offal and other offensive matter, two summonses were issued : firstly, for removing fish offal during prohibited hours, and secondly, for not providing a suitable receptacle. The fines inflicted together amounted to £3 and 2s. costs. For enforcing compliance with notices served to provide suitable manure receptacles, two summonses were issued, an order with costs, being obtained in one case, and a fine of 40s. and 4 s. costs inflicted in regard to the other. 96 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Under the infectious disease prevention clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, one summons was issued in respect of a person knowingly causing another person suffering from infectious disease to be placed in a public conveyance. The magistrate took a lenient view of the case, and the smmmons was dismissed. In conclusion, I have to express my regret, at the severance of my connection with the Public Health work, in which I have always taken a deep interest, and I take this opportunity of returning my best thanks to the members and my colleagues, and especially to the Streatham Local Committee for their unvarying courtesy and support during my twenty-three years of office. F. F. SUTTON, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for Streatham. TOOTING. population As stated in my report for the preceding year, the Estimated Population is a figure presenting the greatest difficulties in calculating, in view of the many institutions in the district, containing large and constantly changing occupants, and of the great number of houses being erected. The census enumeration now being carried out will afford more accurate figures than can ever be arrived at by a simple estimate, but time will not permit of waiting for those figures as a basis of calculation, and I therefore again adopt the round number of 10,000 to represent the population during the year 1900. There is strong reason, however, to believe that this is far below the actual figures as indicated by the yearly increasing birth-rate. Births & Birth Rate. The births registered during the year numbered 478, of these, 230 were males and 242 females, producing a birth-rate equal to 47.8 per 1,000 of the population, an increase of 10.1 per 1,000 upon the previous year. This, however, I have already suggested is probably attributable to too low an estimate of the population. Deaths & Death Rate. The deaths actually registered in the parish during the year numbered 452, being 224 of males and 228 females. This, however, includes the deaths of "non-residents" in the various public institutions located in the parish and which numbered 228, thereby reducing the number of deaths of "residents'' in the parish to 2.4. To produce the corrected death-rate, however, to the latter must be added the 21 deaths of "residents'' occurring in outlying institutions within the H 98 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Metropolis, and which would produce a corrected total of 245, and a mortality rate of 24.5 per 1,000. The corrected total of deaths included 111 males and 134 females. The following Table will show the distribution of deaths of "residents" and "non-residents" of those registered during the year in the sub-district. TABLE I.

Mortality within the sub-district Table IV. gives statistics, classified under six age periods, of the deaths from the principal Zymotic and Non-Zymotic Diseases, and also indicates the number of deaths of "residents" from each of the various diseases, occurring in local public institutions. This Table is slightly varied from the form adopted in previous years, this revision having been made by direction of the Local Government Board, who have as their object the uniform tabulation of vital statistics throughout the country, and consequent facilities for comparative purposes. The statistics contained in this Table are "corrected," that is to say, the deaths of "nonresidents" in the district have been excluded, and those of "residents" occurring outside the district have been included. Table V. is a new Table similarly devised by the Local Government Board, and which gives at a glance a summary of the public health during the last ten years. Parish of Tooting. 101 TABLE IV.

The Prevalence of this disease showed an increase upon the preceding year, the cases notified numbering 63, of which 36 occurred amongst children from 5 to 15 years of age. 40 of the cases, representing 106 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. over 60 per cent., were removed to hospital. As indicating the mild character of the outbreak, it may be mentioned that only one death was recorded from this disease other than amongst "non-residents" in the hospitals within the sub-district. Diphtheria and Membranous Croup Of Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 33 cases were notified, two being recorded from the latter disease which is synonymous with Diphtheria. The cases were distributed with remarkable equality among the various age periods. With two exceptions the whole of the cases were removed to hospital. Three deaths occurred, one at home and the other two in hospital. The statistics for the year under report concerning this disease compare very satisfactorily with the preceding year. Enteric Fever. This disease was generally prevalent throughout, the Metropolis, but, notwithstanding, only 13 cases occurred in Tooting, of which 12 were removed to hospital. With two exceptions all the cases recovered. Six of the cases were between the ages of 15 and 25, and a similar number between the ages of 25 and 65 years. Erysipelas.11 cases of Erysipelas were notified during which were treated at home. No deaths were recorded. other Notiflable infectious Diseases. From the following notifiable infectious diseases no cases were recorded:—Smallpox, Cholera, Typhus, Relapsing, Continued and Puerperal Fevers; nor from Plague which, in consequence of outbreaks of the disease in several parts of this country, was made notifiable by a special order of the Local Government Board in September last. Parish of Tooting. 107 The possibilities of a serious outbreak in the Metropolis are, fortunately, owing to the precautions adopted, now very remote. After infectious disease, 78 rooms were Disinfection. ' disinfected, and bedding stoved in 59 cases. As evidence of t he efficacy of the method of disinfection adopted it may be mentioned that in no case did infectious disease recur after such disinfection had been carried out. For the purposes of Coroner's Inquests, or Mortuary. . in consequence of the insufficient accommodation at the houses of the deceased, 14 bodies were admitted to the mortuary during the year, compared with 12 during the previous year. sanitary operations. The usual Table of Sanitary Operations will found set out in the combined Report. Among the more important items contained therein are 522 inspections of houses, 254 rooms cleansed or repaired, 187 preliminary notices served, all of which were complied with, without the necessity of statutory notices being served. I have the pleasure of again recording my high appreciation of the able and ready manner in which the staff of the Department have carried out their duties during the year. C. de LISLE BROCK, Medical Officer of Health for Tooting. WANDSWORTH. The estimated population of the Parish of Population. Wandsworth for the year 1900 was 69,609, compared with 66,698 in 1899, an increase of 2,911. To ascertain the corrected population, a deduction of 3,906 has to be made for the population of the various public institutions in the parish, giving a population of 65,703, compared with 62,792 in 1899. The population, estimated from the number of inhabited houses in the parish and the average number of persons per house at the census of 1896, was 70,368. Births and Birth-rate During the 52 weeks ending 29th December, 1900, 1900 births (964 of males and 936 of females) were registered in this sub-district, an increase of 12 compared with 1899, but 109 less than the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The birth-rate for the year was 28.92 per 1,000, a decrease of 114 per 1,000 compared with 1899, and 3.06 per 1,000 under the decennial average. During the year, 143 births took place in the Workhouse, an increase of 17 compared with 1899. Of these Parish of Wandsworth. 109 55 belonged to Battersea, 11 to Clapham, 13 to Putney, 20 to Streatham, 8 to Tooting, and 36 to Wandsworth. The corrected number of births was 1,793, and the corrected birth-rate 27.29 per 1,000 compared with 28.49 . in 1899, 28.71 in 1891, and 30.17 in 1897. The rate of natural increase or the excess of births over deaths was uncorrected, 16.89, and corrected 12.27 per 1,000, compared with 17 59 and 12 95 in 1899. The birth-rate for the whole of London for the year was 28.5, and for England and Wales, 28 9 per 1,000, this latter being identical with the uncoirected birth-rate for this parish, but it is 1.63 above the corrected birth-rate. The rate for the year 1900 is the lowest on record, and the same statement holds good for the rate for England and Wales. In 1881, the birth-rate for the parish was 33 7 and in 1891, 35.48 per 1,000, and these rates may be taken as representing fairly accurately the true birth-rate, as the population had only recently been enumerated. The large decrease in the birth-rate is a matter of serious moment, but it is not possible iu this report to enter into the causes of such decrease. Deaths and Death-rate. During the 52 weeks ending 29th December, 1900, 964 deaths (512 of males and 452 of females) were registered, an increase of five deaths compared with 1899, but 48 below the decennial average corrected for increase of population. The death-rate for the year was 13.89 per 1,000, 0 65 under the rate for the year 1899, and 1.33 under the decennial average. 110 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. During the year, 161 deaths occurred in the various public institutions in this parish. 136 of these occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, 13 in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, eight in the Prison, three in the Workhouse, and one in St. Peter's Hospital. No deaths occurred in the Boys' Home, or in the Patriotic Asylum for Girls during the year. 14 deaths of persons belonging to other parishes were registered in this parish, making a total of 175 deaths to be deducted from the total deaths registered, giving a corrected total of 789, compared with 783 in 1889. After correction for the above internal institutions, the death-rate was 12.03 per 1,000, compared with 12.47 in 1889, and 13.36 the decennial average.

The corrected number of deaths was 987, an increase of 11 compared with 1899. The true death-rate for the year was 15 02 per 1,000, compared with 15.54 in 1899, 16.31 in 1898, 15.71 in 1897, and 16.94 in 1896. Corrected for age and sex distribution, the deathrate would be approximately 16*04 per 1,000, compared with 16*59 in 1899, and 17*42 in 1898. The death-rate in the Metropolis for the year 1900 was 18.3 per 1,000, in the 33 great towns 19.5, and for England and Wales 18.3.

The next table shows the number of deaths which occurred during the year from the seven principal epidemic diseases, from other zymotic diseases, the zymotic death-rate, the total deaths from all causes, and the percentage of deaths from zymotic diseases to deaths from all causes. The number for the 10 preceding years is also shown, and the number above or below the decennial average. During the year 157 deaths occurred from these diseases, 74 of males and 83 of females, a decrease of three compared with 1899 and 16 under the corrected decennial average. Measles shows an increase of 13 compared with the year previous, and 1.1 above the decennial average. For the last 10 years this disease shows a tendency to occur in epidemic form every second year Although in 1899 the number of deaths occurring was higher than would have been expected in a non-epidemic year. Enteric fever shows a large increase, 10 deaths having occurred, and Diarrhoea although slightly lower than last year was still above the decennial average. The number of deaths that occurred in the parish from notifiable diseases was 24, compared with 17 in 1899, 27 in 1898, 46 in 1897, 20 in 1896, and 19 in 1895. 120 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report.

The above death-rate does not represent the true rate for the parish as the deaths in the outlying institutions required to be added, and those in internal institutions not belonging to this parish subtracted. Parish of Wandsworth. 121 Six deaths from zymotic diseases occurred in the Union Infirmary (two from Measles, one from Whooping Cough, one from Influenza, one from Puerperal Fever, and one from Erysipelas) five in General or Special Hospital (one from Whooping Cough, one from Influenza, and three from Diarrhoea), and 17 in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board (six from Scarlet Fever, four from Diphtheria, and seven from Enteric Fever), a total of 28, compared with 21 in 1899. In addition to the above there were five deaths in the Union Infirmary registered from Enteritis and one from blood poisoning, two in General or Special Hospitals from other Septic diseases, and one in a Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospital from a Septic disease. In internal institutions three deaths from Enteric Fever, two from Influenza, and one from Diarrhoea occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, two from Influenza in the Hospital for Incurables, one from Enteric Fever and one from Influenza in the Prison, a total of 10. There were also two deaths from Enteritis and one from another Septic disease in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and one from Enteritis in the Prison. For comparison with former years the deaths from Enteritis and other Septic diseases are omitted from the above group, and included in another. Corrected for institutions the number of deaths from zymotic diseases was 175, compared with 172 in 1899, 229 in 1898, 161 in 1897, and 218 in 1896. The corrected zymotic death-rate for the year was 2'65 per 1,000, compared with 2.73 in 1899, 3 81 in 1898, and 2.8 in 1897. Exclusive of Influenza this death-rate was 2.14 per 122 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. 1,000 compared with 2.38 in 1899, This death-rate was in London 2.19 per 1,000 in 1900, and 2.46 in 1899. Inclusive of Enteritis and other Septic diseases the corrected number of deaths in this class was 210, equal to a death-rate of 3.2 per 1,000 of population. No case of this disease was notified during Small Pox. the year. The official report of the vaccination officer for the year 1899 (the last year available) shows that of 1,924 births 1,372 or 71.2 per cent. were successfully vaccinated, 17 were certified as insusceptible, 73 obtained certificates of conscientious objection, 149 died unvaccinated, 194 were postponed, 25 had removed to other districts, and 94 remained on books as unvaccinated. The number of certificates of conscientious objection shows a decided increase, as in 1898 this was 35, and in 1897, 12. There is, however, a small increase in the percentage of successfully vaccinated children, but this increase was not so great as might have been expected under the new Vaccination Law There still remains in this parish a large proportion of children who are unvaccinated, and who, if Small Pox were introduced, would add greatly to the gravity and extent of any epidemic that might ensue. During the year 230 cases of Scarlet Fever were notified, a decrease of 130 compared with 1899, and of 47 compared with 1898. Of these 230 cases, 148 or 64.3 per cent, were removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, where six died, ant. 82 or 35.7 per cent, were treated at home with one death. The case mortality Parish of Wandsworth. 123 was 3 04 per cent, compared with 1.11 per cent. in 1899, and 2 .88 per cent, in 1898. The mortality of the cases treated in hospital was 4.05 per cent, and of those kept at home 1.22 per cent. The case mortality for the whole of the Metropolis was 2'61 per cent compared with 2.19 in 1899. The proportion of notified cases per 1,000 of population was 33, compared with 5.7 in 1899, while for all London this proportion was 3.01, compared with 3.9 per 1,000 in 1899. The death-rate from Scarlet Fever during the year was .106 per 1,000, compared with .063 in 1899, .133 in 1898, and .209 in 1897. The death-rate for London was .08 per 1,000 compared with the same rate in 1899. For the 33 great towns .13 per 1,000, and for England and Wales .12 per 1,000. During the year, 85 cases were notified, Diphtheria. Compared with 121 in 1899, 162 in 898, and 243 in 1897. This large and continuous diminution in the number of cases of Diphtheria is extremely satisfactory, and it is to be hoped that next year will show a still further diminution. Of these 85 cases, 51 or exactly 60 per cent. were removed to hospital, where four died, and 34 or 40 per cent were treated at home with seven deaths. In 1899 the percentage of cases removed to hospital was 68.6 and in 1898, 62.3. 11 deaths occurred during the year, a case mortality of 12.9 per cent compared with 13.22 in 1899, 16.6 in 1898, and 20.1 in 1897. 124 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. The mortality of the hospital treated cases was 7.8 per cent., and of those treated at home 20.6 per cent., or nearly three times as great. In 1899, these rates were respectively 10.84 and 18.42, and in 1898, 12.8 and 23 per cent. The low mortality of the hospital treated cases compared with those treated at home, is due to the fact that in hospital all, or nearly all, the cases are at once treated with Antitoxic Serum, while in those kept at home, such treatment is not so efficiently carried out. Membranous Two cases were notified with no deaths, Croup. compared with three cases and three deaths in 1899. Nearly all these cases are now notified as Laryngeal Diphtheria. The total number of deaths from the two diseases was 11, compared with 19 in 1899. The case mortality was 12.6 per cent, compared with 15.2 in 1899, 16.3 in 1898, and 20.2 in 1897. The rate of cases notified per 1,000 of population was 1.25 compared with 1.81 in 1899, 2.6 in 1898, and 4.3 in 1897. For all London this rate was 2.6 in 1900, 3.01 in 1899, 2 6 in 1898, and 2.9 in 1897. This parish had, consequently, only half the rate for the Metropolis as a whole. The case mortality for all London was 12.83 per cent, compared with 14.21 in 1899, 14.8 in 1898, and 17 in 1897. The death-rate from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup per 1,000 of population was .166, compared with •306 in 1899, .449 in 1898 and 854 in 1897. Parish of Wandsworth. 125 The death-rate for the whole of London was 335, compared with .420 in 1899. This parish consequently shows a greatly lessened death-rate, not only compared with last year, but also compared with the whole of London. The death-rate for England and Wales was .29 per 1,000, .121 above the death-rate for this parish. During the year, 69 cases were notified and Enteric Fever. 17 deaths occurred, compared with 45 cases and five deaths in 1899, and 51 cases with six deaths in 1898. 33 of the cases were removed to hospital, where 10 died, and 36 were treated at home with seven deaths. The proportion of cases notified per 1,000 of population, was .99 compared with .93 for the whole of London. Of these 69 cases, eight were notified from the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and one from the Brompton Hospital, leaving 60 cases properly belonging to this parish. The proportion of notified cases corrected for above was .91 per 1,000, slightly under the rate for all London. This disease was more prevalent during the year 1900 than in the previous years, and this was not peculiar to this parish but applies to the whole of the Metropolis. The subjoined table shows the prevalence in the various wards of the parish:— 126 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. Ward. Cases. Deaths. Southfield 5 2 Northfield 7 1 Fairfield 12 1 Heathfield 10 2 Earlsfield 20 5 Springfield 15 5 Total 69 16 One death, which was not notified, occurred in the Prison, making a total of 17. Of the 17 deaths, three occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, and one in the Prison, giving a corrected total of 13. The corrected case mortality was 21.6, compared with 16.6 per cent. for the whole of London. In nine of the cases notified, the disease was contracted in other districts; in six, the patients had eaten shellfish within the period of incubation of the disease; and in 21 sanitary defects were found in the houses occupied by the patients. One of the cases was a soldier who had come home on furlough from Curragh Camp and who was ill before leaving. In one house there were four cases notified, in one three, and in one, two. The disease was most prevalent in the Earlsfield and Heathfield wards, but was not present in epidemic form. In Table XI. it will be observed that the number of cases notified varied from 11 in January to two in Parish of Wandsworth. 127 April, and three in May, but in no month during the year was there no notification received. In every case due precautions were taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and in every case this was successful. The corrected death-rate from fever was .19 per 1,000, compared with .07 in 1899 and .09 in 1898, while the rate for all London was .15 in 1900, .16 in 1899, and .12 in 1898. The rate for England and Wales was 17 per 1,000. puerperal There were only two cases with one death Fever. notified, compared with 4 cases and 1 death in 1899. 110 cases were notified and 7 deaths Erysipelas. suited, compared with 96 cases and 3 deaths in 1899. Measles deaths were registered during the year, 2 of these occurring in the Union Infirmary. The death-rate was .48 per 1,000 compared with .28 in 1899, and in the Metropolis .42 per 1,000, compared with 47 in 1899. The following Table shows the number of cases notified to me by the teachers in the several Board Schools in the parish, and although it by no means gives an accurate statement of the cases that occurred, yet it shows approximately the localities in the parish where Measles, as well as the other diseases shown, was most prevalent during the year. 128 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report.

The number of deaths was thus 16 less than last year, and 19.4 under the corrected decennial average. The death-rate per 1,000 was .16 in 1900, and .40 in 1899, while for all London these rates were respectively .42 and .38. From Diarrhoea 60 deaths were registered Diarrhœa. . compared with 71 in 1899, 83 in 1898, and 48 in 1897. The corrected decennial average was 52.1. Three deaths occurred in an external and one in an internal institution, making a corrected total of 62, compared with 71 last year. 51 or 82.2 per cent. of the deaths were of infants under one year. The death-rate per 1,000 was corrected .94, compared with 113 in 1899, 1.39 in 1898 and .85 in 1897. For the whole of London the death-rate was .76 per 1,000, for the 33 great towns .91, and for England and Wales .69. The above figures do not accurately represent the number of deaths that occur among infants during the Parish of Wandsworth. 129 hot summer months from Diarrhoea, as.many medical men do not certify the deaths as due to Diarrhoea, but to Gastro-Enteritis or to simple Enteritis. In future all these diseases will be grouped under two main heads, Epidemic Diarrhoea, or Enteritis, and a comparison of these in future years will give a more correct estimate of the increase or decrease of this, one of the most fatal diseases among infants. During 1900, in addition to the 62 deaths from Diarrhoea, there were 31 deaths from Enteritis, 20 of these occurring in children under one year, making a total of 93 from the two diseases, and consequently increasing the death-rate from these to 1.41 per 1,000. 34 deaths occurred from this disease, compared influenza. with 22 and 23 in 1898. Two of these occurred in the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum, two in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and one in the Prison, while two occurred in outlying institutions, giving a corrected total of 31, compared with 23 last year. The death-rate was .47 per 1000, compared with .46 in 1899. The next table shows the death-rates per 1,000 from seven of these zymotic diseases, including those in outlying institutions for the years 1898, 1899, and 1900:— TABLE IX.

Diarrhoea, Diphtheria, and Whooping Cough, are lower than in 1899, but the other four show a higher rate. One satisfactory feature in the above Table is the large diminution in the mortality from Diphtheria and Membranous Croup. The death-rate from Scarlet Fever, although higher than last year, is somewhat lower than the same rates for 1897 and 1898. Notification of Infectious Diseases Table X. shows in detail the number of cases of infectious diseases notified, the number removed to hospital, the number that died in hospital and at home, as well as the total deaths. 498 cases were notified, compared with 630 in 1899, 605 in 1898, 804 in 1S97, and 654 in 1896. Of Scarlet Fever, 230 cases were notified, compared with 360 last year, of Diphtheria 85, compared with 121, of Membranous Croup two, compared with four, of Enteric Fever 69, compared with 45, of Puerperal Fever 2, compared with four, and of Erysipelas 110, compared with 96. Enteric Fever and Erysipelas show an increase, while the others show a large decrease. The total number of cases notified per 1,000 persons living was 7.15, compared with 10 in 1899, 9.4 in 1898, 14.7 in 1897, 11.1 in 1896, and 9.5 in 1895. The rate was thus lower than any of the five preceding yrars. For the whole of the Metropolis the rate was 7.7, compared with 9 3 in 1899, 8.3 in 1898, 10.2 in 1897, and 11.1 in 1896. Parish of Wandsworth. 131 The total number of deaths from the above notifiable diseases was 43, seven of which occurred from Scarlet Fever, 11 from Diphtheria, 17 from Enteric Fever, seven from Erysipelas, and one from Puerperal Fever. 17 of the deaths occurred in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, four from Diphtheria, six from Scarlet Fever, and seven from Enteric Fever. The death-rate from all notifiable diseases was corrected for institutions .59, compared with '51 per 1,000 in 1899, .78 in 1898, 1.1 in 1897, and 66 in 1896, while fur all London this rate was .58, compared with .77 in 1899,.71 in 1898, .81 in 1897, and .72 in 1896.

Return cases scarlet Fever. of During 1899, there were only four cases in which Scarlet Fever occurred after the return of a case from one of the Metropolitan Asylums Board hospitals. In 1899 there were six cases, and in 1898, 13. (1).—First case returned from hospital on February 3rd, and the second case was notified on February 10th. (2 and 3).—First case returned from hospital on October 27th, second case notified on October 31st, and third case on November 2nd. (4).—First case returned from hospital on November 20th, and second case was notified on November 26th. Five cases of Scarlet Fever and three cases of Erysipelas were notified from the Workhouse, one case of Scarlet Fever and three of Erysipelas from the Boys' Home, and nine cases of Typhoid Fever from the Asylum, a total of 19, compared with 114 in 1899, 65 in 1898, and 37 in 1897.

These deaths formed 83 7 per cent, of the total mortality, compared with 83'9 in 1899. Corrected for institutions the total number of deaths was 815, or 82.5 per cent, of the total mortality, compared with 804 or 82.3 per cent, in 1899. Parish of Wandsworth. 135 From all Tubercular diseases, 143 deaths occurred, 37 more than in the year previous, and 23 above the corrected decennial average. In external institutions 23 deaths, and in internal 27 deaths occurred from these diseases, a corrected total of 142 compared with 116 in 1899, 118 in 1898, and 102 in 1897. The total death-rate was 216 per 1,000, compared with 1.81 in 1899, 1.96 in 1898, and 1.79 in 1897. Consumption, or Tubercular disease of the lungs, was the cause of 95 deaths, an increase of 18 compared with the previous year. 23 deaths occurred in internal institutions (21 in the Asylum, one in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and one, a man belonging to another parish, died suddenly in the street). In external institutions 20 deaths occurred (19 in the Union Infirmary, and one in a general hospital). The corrected total was 92, compared with 85 in 1899, 72 in 1898, and the death-rate was 1.4 in 1900, 1.35 in 1899, and 1.23 in 1897. The increase in the number of deaths from Tubercular disease of the lungs, although slight, is still a matter for grave consideration. This parish is rapidly increasing in density of population, and unless some preventive measures are taken the rate will certainly increase. Something has been done by the sanitary authority, by the distribution of notices calling attention to the infective nature of Consumption and the methods that might be used to prevent it, but I am of opinion that unless more stringent measures are taken, such as a certain amount of isolation and disinfection of rooms and houses where consumptives have lived and died, the number of deaths will increase. 136 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. From other Tubercular diseases there were 48 deaths, four of these occurring in internal institutions. There were six deaths in outlying institutions, making a corrected total of 50, an increase of 19 compared with the previous year. 23 of the above deaths occurred in children under one year, and 20 in children from one to five years, while only seven occurred at other ages. The fact that so many deaths from Tuberculosis of the bowels and brain occurred in young children, is a strong argument in favour of the opinion that the drinking of milk, in which the germ of this disease is present, is the cause of these diseases. From Gout, Rhumatism, Cancer, and other Constitutional diseases 35 deaths occurred, 25 less than in 1899, and 24 below the corrected decennial average. There were 11 deaths in external, and seven in internal institutions, the corrected total being 39 compared with 79 in the previous year. Cancer alone was the cause of 34 deaths, compared with 55 in 1899, 41 in 1898, and 48 in 1897. From diseases of the brain and nervous system 93 deaths were registered, 23 fewer than last year, and 37.5 under the decennial average. In the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum there occurred 46 deaths from these diseases, five in the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and one in St. Peter's Hospital, a total of 52, or 22 less than last year. In external institutions 26 deaths occurred, making a corrected total of 67, compared with 58 in 1899. From diseases of the organs of circulation there were 99 deaths, eight less than last year, but 17.2 above Parish of Wandsworth. 137 the decennial average. In internal institutions there were 14 deaths (11 in the Asylum, two in the Workhouse, and one in the Royal Hospital for Incurables) while two deaths of persons, belonging to other parishes, occurred in the street. There were 26 deaths in external institutions, making a corrected total of 109, compared with 117 in 1899, 113 in 1898, and 121 in 1897. 187 deaths occurred from diseases of the organs of respiration, 32 above last year, and 3.2 above the decennial average. 20 deaths occurred in external and 16 in internal institutions, making a corrected total of 191, compared with 172 in 1899, 166 in 1898, and 186 in 1897. Of these 191 deaths, 78 occurred from Bronchitis, 105 from Pneumonia, five from Pleurisy, one from Laryngitis or Non-diphtheritic Croup, and two from other diseases of the respiratory organs. There were 70 deaths from diseases of the digestive organs. Seven occurred in external and two in internal institutions, making a corrected total of 75, compared with 71 in 1899, 53 in 1898, and 78 in 1897. From diseases of the urinary organs there were 18 deaths, compared with the same number in 1899, and 20 in 1898. From premature birth, low vitality, and congenital defects the corrected number of deaths was 67, compared with 80 in 1899, and 78 in 1898. All these deaths were of infants under one year. 55 deaths occurred from old age, 25 of males and 30 of females, a decrease of 18, compared with 1899, hut three above the decennial average. 20 of these deaths occurred in internal institutions (19 in the Asylum and one in the Convent), while in external 1 38 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. institutions, 11 deaths occurred in the Union Infirmary, and three in general and special hospitals, making a corrected total of 49, compared with 56 in 1899, and 39 in 1898. Violence was the cause of 31 deaths, 23 of males and eight of females, seven more than in 1899, and 2 4 above the corrected average. Five of these deaths occurred in the Asylum, while eight occurred in the Union Infirmary, and nine in general and special hospitals, a total of 17. Five deaths from violence, of persons belonging to other parishes, occurred in this parish. The corrected total was thus 38, compared with 27 in 1899. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year was 269, seven less than last year, and 11 less than occurred in 1898. Three deaths occurred in internal and 19 in external institutions, the corrected total being 285, compared with 288 in 1899, and 292 in 1898. Corrected for institutions, the infantile death-rate was 162 per 1,000, compared with 160 in 1899, and 169 in 1898. For the whole of London this rate was 158. The percentage of these deaths to the total deaths was, corrected, 28.8, compared with 29.5 in 1899, and 29.8 in 1898. This death-rate is still too high, but the high rate was not due, as in previous years, so much to Diarrhoea and other zymotic diseases, as to diseases of the organs of respiration, and to tubercular diseases. In 1899 there were 12 deaths of children under one year from diseases of a tubercular nature, while in 1900 this number was 27. Parish of Wandsworth. 139 senile Mortality. During the year there were 170 deaths of persons over 70 years of age. Of these 74 were males and 96 females, a decrease of two males and 26 females, compared with the previous year. The following Table shows the number of these deaths at different quinquennial periods:— TABLE XIII. Age. Males. Females. Total.

The number of deaths among the industrial and labouring classes shows a decided increase, compared with the decennial average, but from zymotic diseases this increase is only very slight. The increase in the number of deaths from zymotic diseases in the middle and trading classes was chiefly due to Influenza. 140 Medical Officers of Health Annual Report. TABLE XIV. Social Position.

Table XVI. in the geneial report shows in tabular form the work carried, out by the sanitary inspectors during the year. 3,298 houses and premises were inspected during the year, compared with 3,035 in 1899, 3,391 in 1898, and 4,597 in 1897. The total number of houses inspected in house-tohouse inspection was 1,453, an increase of 322 compared with last year, and of 115 compared with 1898. The following Table shows the number of houses inspected in each street, the number of houses in which sanitary defects were found, aud the percentage of defects to houses inspected. The number of families living in one room, two rooms, three rooms, and four rooms and upwards, is also given. The percentage of defects to houses inspected was 57.6, as compared with 45.04 in 1899. The number of families living in one room was greatest in Wardley Street, Warple Way, and Point Pleasant, but the great majority of houses inspected were occupied by families who rented four rooms and upwards.

Daring the year, 347 lots of bedding were disinfected at the Disinfecting Station. These 347 lots representing 7,915 articles, as follows:— 300 beds, 267 bolsters, 724 pillows, 243 mattresses, 593 sheets, 348 palliasses, 417 quilts, 300 cushions, 2,121 articles of clothing, 816 blankets, 545 carpets, and 1,241 extra articles. In addition to the above the whole of the disinfection for the Parishes of Streatham and Tooting, and a small amount for private persons, was done at the Disinfecting Station. Exclusive of the work for this parish 302 lots representing 6,340 articles, were disinfected. I have again to report that the whole of the disinfection was most efficiently carried out. Parish of Wandsworth. 145 27 cases of overcrowding were abated, compared with 22 in 1899, 26 in 1898, and 39 in 1897. The number of rooms, staircases and passages cleansed and repaired showed a very large increase, viz. : 1,045 compared with 585 in 1899, and 171 in 1898. This was due to the fact that in several streets in which house-to-house inspections were made by the Sanitary Inspectors every room in the house required cleansing. 178 drains were relaid, compared with 175 in 1899, and 226 drains were cleansed and repaired, compared with 215 in 1899. 487 waterclosets were cleansed and repaired, and a separate supply of water was laid on to 28 waterclosets, compared with 360 and 58 in 1899. The number of cases in which water was required to be laid on has steadily diminished for the last few years. In 38 cases, notices were served for the removal of accumulations of manure, compared with 33 last year. Three dilapidated houses were cleansed and repaired, compared with 15 in 1899, and 11 houses were resupplied with water, compared with six in 1899.

Parish of Wandsworth. 147 Factories and workshops. 122 of these (29 factories and 93 workshops), were inspected during the year. Notices were served for the following sanitary defects:—lour dirty and offensive waterclosets, three waterclosets with doors opening directly into workrooms, one workshop with defective drainage, two without proper dung pits, two without proper dust bins, and one badly paved and drained yard. Two notices were received from the Factory Inspector during the year, but in one of these, notice had previously been served by the Sanitary Inspector. Unsound Food. The following were destroyed during the year at the request of the owners, and certificates were given in every case :—four boxes of herrings, one bushel of whelks, one box of whiting, and eight wild rabbits. Houses Let in Lodgings. There are now 36 on the register, an increase of 14 compared with last year. The whole of the necessary cleansing was done at the statutory period, and the houses were frequently inspected during the year, and found in a satisfactory sanitary condition. I have again to report that the sanitary inspectors have carried out all their duties to my entire satisfaction. P.

ANNUAL STATEMENT Of the work done under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, condensed from his statutory quarterly reports, by THE PUBLIC ANALYST. During the year 1900, the Inspector brought to the South London Central Public Laboratory 587 samples of Food and Drugs, classified as follows:— Dairy produce 422 Groceries 118 Bread and Cereals 23 Alcoholic Beverages 13 Confectionery 6 Drugs 5 Total 587 The following Tables indicate the nature and number of the various articles examined and the results of their analysis. I.—Dairy Produce. The articles entered under this head included .— Butter Milk Margarine Cheese Lard 204 samples. 193 „ 12 „ 9 „ 4 „ Total 422 samples. All these were legally genuine, except the following 41 which were found to be more or less deficient — 149 Report—Public Analyst. Articles submitted. Nature and extent of Impurity.

The above Table shows that 17 per cent, of the milk samples departed from the accepted standard of purity, while in the case of butter only only, 2 94 per cent, of the samples contained margarine, and of the margarine samples 16.6 per cent, contained butter in excess of the legal allowance of 10 per cent. This shows a decided falling off in the milk supply from 11.22 per cent, of impurity in 1899 to 17 per cent, in 1900. The butter, on the other hand, has improved, the proportion of adulteration having fallen from 9.16 per cent, to 2.94 per cent. II.— Groceries. These included :— Tea 28 samples. Coffee 26 „ Pepper 21 „ Cocoa 15 „ Sago 12 „ Mustard 4 „ Baking Powder 4 „ Tapioca 3 „ Ground Almonds 2 „ Jams 2 „ Sugar 1 „ Total 118 The following two were found to be adulterated as under:— Name of Article. Nature and extent of impurity. Coffee 25 per cent, of Chicory. Sago 34 per cent, of Tapioca. This is again a falling off, as during 1899 all the groceries were found genuine. III.—Bread and Cereals. Twenty-three samples of flour were examined and all found genuine. Report—Public Analyst. 151 IV.—Alcoholic Beverages. Five samples of ale, four of whiskey, two of beer and two of porter were submitted. All were found genuine and free from arsenic. V.— Confectionery. The samples submitted were six in number, and consisted of two sweets, two sweet scones and two rice buns. They were found to contain no arsenic or other deleterious ingredients and were therefore classed as " genuine." VI.—Drugs. Two samples of " Medicine as prescribed," one of "Compound Liquorice Powder," one of "Tincture of Opium," and one of " Gregory's Powder," were submitted and all were found correct, which is an improvement on 1899, when 23 per cent, of the samples examined were condemned. In conclusion, I regret to have to report that the food and drug supply of the District as a whole has not yet regained its normal state after the great retrogression experienced during 1899 ; but it has improved to a certain extent, the general percentage of adulteration being 7.3 per cent. in. 1900 as against 8.3 per cent, in 1899. As the normal state of the District (shown by experience of 28 years) should work out at not exceeding 5 per cent, it would seem advisable to somewhat increase the stringency of inspection by enlarging the number of samples purchaseable by the Inspector.
