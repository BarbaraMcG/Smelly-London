BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. .FINAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH ON THE OUTBREAK OF SMALL-POX. Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, N. 10th November 1902. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, I am now in a position to report finally on the epidemic of Small Pox which has been prevalent in the borough during part of the years 1901 and 1902, for apparently the end of the epidemic has been reached; although it is possible that some sporadic cases may from time to time be notified. Period of time during which it Lasted.—The first cases became known on August 27th 1901 and the last notification was received on August 29th, 1902, so that the period covered by the epidemic was exactly one year and three days. Number of Notifications and Genuine Cases.—During the epidemic 354 notification certificates, relating to separate cases, were received, of which 317 proved genuine Small Pox, while in 37 instances, representing 10.4 per cent. of the notifications, the diagnoses were inaccurate. Intensity or the Epidemic.—The 317 cases were in the proportion of 9.4 per ten thousand persons estimated to be living in the borough. This proportion will be found to contrast very favourably with other metropolitan boroughs, as will subsequently be seen. In the Sub-Registration Districts.—In Tufnell sub-district 12 cases occurred, in Upper Holloway 32, in Tollington 28, in Lower Holloway 43, in Highbury 30, in Barnsbury 77, 10 of which were brought into the district while ill, and in South-east Islington 95, These cases bore the proportion to ever}- 10.000 of the population as follows: — Per 10,00 Inhabitants. Inhabitants. Tufnell 3.69 Highbury 4.65 Upper Holloway 9.30 Barnsbury14.16 cr 12.32 Tollington 8.14 South-east Islington 12.56 Lower Holloway 10.36 The proportion in Barnsbury should be 12.32 per 10,000 of its population, because ten cases were brought into the district from the Salvation Training School in Hackney while ill, but at a time when the disease had not been positively identified. Intensity of the Disease in London.—The returns of the Medical Officer of Health for London, published by the Registrar General in his quarterly reports, show that 9,451 cases were notified. These represent an attack rate of 20.6 per 10,000 of the population, or 11.2 per 10,000 more than the attack rate of Islington. Naturally the incidence of the disease varied considerably in the various districts, and an examination of the returns shows that it ranged from 3.1 in Hampstead, 5.9 in Chelsea and Wandsworth, 6.3 in Kensington, 7.4 in Fulham, and 7.5 in Lewisham to 30.3 in Finsbury, 38.9 in Shoreditch, 41.3 in Poplar, 42.3 in Bethnal Green, 51.3 in Stepney, and 73.1 in Holborn. Intensity in the Districts Encircling Islington.—In Hackney the attack rate per 10,000 inhabitants was 20.8, in St. Pancras 26.1, in F'insbury 30.3, in Shoreditch 38.9, with which the attack rate in Islington of 9.4 compares very favourably. Mortality and Fatality.—The total number of death- registered was 61, which represent a fatality rate of 19.2 per cent. of the cases. State of Vaccination of the Persons Attacked.—Of the 317 person- attacked, 2.36, or 74.4 per cent. were vaccinated; 6o, or 20.5 per cent unvaccinated; and 16, or 5.0 per cent., were persons whose condition as to vaccination could not be ascertained. Among the 236 vaccinated cases, 29 deaths occurred, representing a fatality of 12.29 per cent. Among the 65 unvaccinated cases 30 daths occurred, representing a fatality of 46.15 per cent. Among the 16 cases whose state as to vaccination was unknown 2 deaths occurred, representing a fatality 12.50 per cent. Among the 236 vaccinated together with the 16.whose state as to vaccination was unknown 31 deaths occurred, representing a fatality of 12.30 per cent. 2 The meaning of these figures is so plain, teaching, as they do, so strong a lesson as to the value of vaccination as a safeguard against Small Pox resulting fatally, that I will not insult your common sense by commenting on them. Ages of the Attacked.—Among all the cases 46 were under ten years of age, of whom 17, or 37.0 per cent. died; 54 were between 10 and 20 years of age, of whom 11, or 20.4 per cent. died ; and 217 of whom 33 or 15.2 per cent. died, were above the latter age. Ages of the vaccinated.—10 were under ten years old, and of these none died. 38 were between ten and twenty years old, of whom 3, or 7.89 per cent. died; andwin 188 were above the latter age, and of these 26, or 13.83 per cent. died. Ages of the unvaccinated.—36 were under ten years old and of them 17, or 47.22 per cent. died; 15 were between ten and twenty years old, of whom 8, or 53.33 per cent. die.; and 14 were over the la..tter age, and of these 5, or 35.71 per cent. died. Ages of those whose state as to vaccination was unknown.—No cases occurred among persons under ten years old. One was between ten and twenty years old, and he did not die; and 15 were over the latter age, of whom 2, or 13.33 per cent. died. It will be noticed that, whereas no child under ten years old, who had been vaccinated, died, yet 17 out of 36 children at the same age period who had not been so protected died. It will also be recollected that the strong claim put forward on behalf of vaccination is, that it is a great prevention of infection for seven years, and that it is almost a certain security against death. These figures bear out these claims. Vaccinations.—I have been unable to ascertain with any degree of accuracy, the actual number of persons who were vaccinated during the epidemic, but undoubtedly they were very numerous. I have, however, obtained a statement as to the fees paid to the Public Vaccinators, and Vaccination Officers during a period of seven years, which throws considerable light on the question. COST OF THE EPIDEMIC. The cost to the Borough Council was ,£761 16s. 3d., in addition to which there were certain charges which had not been kept separate from the usual departmental accounts, and which included the following items: additional disinfectants for distribution, chemicals and materials used in disinfecting rooms,etc., expenses for up-keep of Shelter House and disinfecting station, travelling expenses of Medical Officer of Health and Inspectors, the cost of removing suspects to Shelter House and postage. The Borough Treasurer has kindly prepared the following statement: COST OF SMALL-POX OUTBREAK. £ s, d. £ s. d.

Persons in the Public Health Department Staff Exposed to Infection.—I think it ought to be known that every member of the Public Health Department Staff had been revaccinated at the commencement of the epidemic unless he had previously been similarly protected, and that not one of them contracted the disease. Altogether 42 persons were exposed to direct infection, and seven to indirect infection. The former included those officials whose duty it was to visit the houses in which the attacked persons resided, or who disinfected clothing, and the latter included the clerks in the office who had to interview persons who came from these houses.

Thanks to the Medical Profession.—I cannot close this report without expressing my heartiest thanks to the medical profession practising in Islington, for the great assistance they invariably afforded me in my efforts to curtail the epidemic. Their aid has been at times most valuable, and opportune, while as a rule their notifications have been exceedingly prompt. Finally I owe it to all the members of the Public Health Department Staff to recognize the strenuous manner in which they worked. No staff could have done better, indeed the limits to which the epidemic was confined in the borough, considering that the disease existed to a severe extent in every borough surrounding it, is proof positive that their efforts were most successful. They are, therefore, justly entitled to all the praise that I can give them. They were not only a credit to Islington but an example to the officers of every municipal authority.

Report of the Medical Officer of Health on the Carriage of Milk by Railway in Unsealed or Unfastened Churns. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, The Carriage of Milk by Railway in Unsealed or Unfastened Churns. There is a matter of great importance in connection with the carriage of milk by rail, to which I would draw your particular attention. In almost every prosecution for the adulteration of milk taken against the large vendors, the defence of warranty is raised, but in addition the defendants nearly always declare that the milk was sold as it was received from the farmer. When, however, the latter is appealed to he declares, and I think generally truthfully, that he has not tampered with it, and had sent it to London just as it came from his cows, pure milk with all its cream. The inference therefore naturally arises that it had been tampered with on the railway, an event which I believe to be of very rare occurrence. There could, however, have been no tampering with the churns if they had been locked or sealed. When the vendors or consignors are asked in Court why they did not seal or lock their churns, they invariably declare that the Railway Companies will not allow them to do so, as it would interfere with the examination, the measuring, or the weighing of the contents. In studying the evidence of the Departmental Commission on Milk, I find that this statement is absolutely incorrect, for in a letter dated 29th May 1899 (see correspondence appended hereto) the Assistant Secretary of the Board of Agriculture inquired of the Railway Companies' Association through the Board of Trade if it was their practice to require milk churns to be unlocked, and if in consequence the consignor is unable to take any precautions to prevent persons tampering with their contents, and in reply was informed by the Railway Companies' Association in a communication dated 12th October 1898 and signed by Sir Henry Oakley, that " senders have been for a long time allowed " to send milk in sealed cans, the companies accept the declaration of the senders as to the quantity " conveyed, no extra charge being made ; the only condition the companies require to be fulfilled is " that the tare weight of the cans shall be stamped on the outside of the can, so that in case of doubt " the quantity of milk within the churn can be approximately ascertained by allowing l0¼lbs. for each " gallon of milk declared. It does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the " senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or other" wise fastening the cans." This correspondence is of the greatest importance as it altogether disposes of the consignors' and vendors' contention. If, hitherto, this contention has been made in ignorance of the railway regulations, then the sooner such ignorance is dispelled the better. I therefore suggest that a communication be addressed to each milk vendor in Islington who receives milk by rail, advising him to get it delivered to him in sealed, padlocked or fastened churns; at the same time enclosing a copy of the correspondence laid before the Milk Committee and cautioning him that if hereafter his milk should be found adulterated and a prosecution follow, the fact that he has not availed himself of permissible means to protect the milk supply while in transit will be urged against him, although he may produce a warranty, and that the Court will be asked to say that he has been guilty of contributory negligence. I would further suggest that the Railway Companies carrying milk for Islington purveyors should insist not only in the interest of their servants who are practically looked upon as the delinquents but particularly in that of the public, that all cans sent to them for delivery shall in future be locked, sealed or fastened. I make these two suggestions hoping that you may adopt them; and that you may also approach the Railway Companies through the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture with reference to the second. I have not the least doubt that, if the Railway Companies refused to carry milk in unfastened cans, the adulteration of milk would be much checked and the unfortunate farmer would cease to be so frequently, and I believe often undeservedly,* made the scapegoat for the large wholesale milk vendors in London and elsewhere. I am, your obedient servant, A. E. HARRIS, Town Hall, Islington, N. Medical Officer of Health. 23rd December, 1901. * This statement is based on the fact that out of 562 milks arriving at the G.N.R. Station Finsbury Park from farmers only 7 were found an analysing to be adulterated, [over.] 2 CARRIAGE OF MILK BY RAIL.

Sir, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture to state, for the information of the Board of Trade, that, in the course of the proceedings on the Sale of Food and Drugs Bill, it has been represented that considerable hardship arises by reason of the prosecution of milk producers in cases in which milk is proved to have been pure when handed over to a railway company for conveyance to the consignee, but is found upon arrival at the station of destination to have been adulterated. The Board are informed that, except in cases in which rates in excess of those usually charged for the conveyance of milk are paid, it is the practice of the railway companies to require that milkchurns delivered to them for conveyance by rail should be unlocked, and the consignor is therefore unable to take any precautions to prevent persons, whether in the employ of the company or not, from having access to or from tampering with the milk while it is in the charge of the company, although he still remains liable to prosecution should the milk be adulterated in transit The Board desire me therefore to invite the observations of the Board of Trade on the subject, and to inquire whether in their judgment it would be feasible to provide any remedy for the complaints referred to. I am, etc., (Signed) P. G. Craigie. II. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Secretary, Board of Agriculture. 17th October 1899. Sir, Adverting to your letter of the 20th May last with reference to the regulations of railway companies respecting the conveyance of milk, and to the question of the liability to prosecution in the event of milk being adulterated in transit, I am directed by the Board of Trade to transmit herewith for the information of the Board of Agriculture a copy of a letter which has been received from the Railway Companies' Association on the subject. I am, etc., (Signed) Francis J. S. Hopwood. Enclosure. From Railway Companies' Association, King's Cross Station, to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. October12th 1899. Sir, With reference to your communication (No. R. 7,352) of the 29th May last, enclosing a copy of a letter dated 20th May from the Board of Agriculture, with regard to the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk, and to the question of the liability to prosecution in the event of the milk being adulterated in transit: The railway companies have considered the question, and I am requested to inform you with reference to the statement made in the letter from the Board of Agriculture, that senders have for a long time been allowed to send milk in sealed cans, the companies accept the declaration of the senders as to the quantity conveyed, no extra charge being made; the only condition the companies require to be fulfilled is that the tare weight of the cans shall be stamped upon the outside of the can, so that in case of doubt the quantity of milk within the churn can be approximately ascertained by allowing 10¼ lbs. for each gallon of milk declared. It does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or otherwise fastening their cans. I am, etc. (Signed) H. Oakley. III. From Assistant Secretary, Board of Agriculture, to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. 9th November 1899. Sir, Adverting to Mr. Hopwood's letter of the 17th 17th, (R. 12,901), and to the enclosure from Sir Henry Oakley on behalf of the Railway Companies' Association, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture to inquire whether they may understand from Sir Henry Oakley's letter that sealed or 3 padlocked milk cans are, as a matter of fact, conveyed by the railway companies at the reduced milk rate (at owner's risk), provided that they are stamped with the tare weight of the cans, and that Section 8 of the Companies' Conditions of Carriage does not apply to such cans. With reference to the concluding sentence of Sir Henry Oakley's letter, viz., that it does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or otherwise fastening their cans, I am to point out that the published conditions of the Great Northern Railway contain no provision relating to sealed cans, but, on the contrary, state specifically (Section 8) that the company shall have power to open any cans, a condition that appears to preclude their being securely fastened. I am, etc., (Signed) P. G. Craigie IV. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Secretary, Board of Agriculture. 24th November 1899. Sir, With reference to Major Craigie's letter of the 9th instant respecting the conveyance of milk by railway companies, I am directed by the Board of Trade to transmit herewith, for the information of the Board of Agriculture, a copy of correspondence which has since taken place between the Railway Companies' Association and the Board of Trade on the subject. I am, etc., (Signed) T. H. W. Pelham. Enclosure No. 1. From Railway Companies' Association to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department}, Board of Trade November 15th 1899. Sir, With reference to your letter (No. R. 13,936) of the 14th instant and the communication from Mr. Craigie which accompanied it, respecting the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk, and the question of liability tc prosecution in the event of milk being adulterated in transit, I made enquiry before I replied to your letter dated May 20th, and was informed that, as a matter of fact, the railway companies did convey milk in sealed cans, provided they were stamped as required by Clause No. 4 of the railway companies' regulations. With regard to Clause No. 8 of the regulations, the meaning is obvious that if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a can contains a greater quantity of milk than that invoiced, the companies in such cases reserve to themselves power to open the can to ascertain that the quantity therein contained agrees with the quantity declared. It is simply a protective clause there is no reason to exercise if the milk be honestly declared. I am, etc., (Signed) H. Oakley. Enclosure No. 2. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Railway Companies' Association. 20th November 1899. Sir, I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in reply to the letter from the Board of Agriculture of the 9th instant, respecting the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk. I am to state with reference to the first paragraph of your letter that the Board of Agriculture also appear to wish to know if any difference is made in the rates charged for the conveyance of milk when the milk is sent in sealed or padlocked cans. With regard to the second paragraph, I am to enquire if the Board of Agriculture are to understand that the companies reserve to themselves power to open sealed or padlocked cans, though according to your letter of the 12th ultimo when the tare weight is stamped upon the outside of the can the quantity of milk inside could, in case of doubt, be approximately ascertained by allowing 10J lbs. for each gallon of milk declared. I am, etc., (Signed) Francis J. S. Hopwood. Enclosure No. 3. From Railway Companies' Association to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. November 21 st 1899. Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant (No. R. 14,232), respecting the communication from the Board of Agriculture on the subject of the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk. I am informed by all the principal railway companies that they do not make any difference in the charges when sealed cans are used. The companies do reserve the right to open locked cans when there is any reason to the accuracy of the consignment. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON. REPORT of MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH on the CARRIAGE of MILK by RAILWAY in UNSEALED and UNFASTENED CHURNS. Presented, to the Borough Council January 3rd 1902, by Order of the Public Health Committee. Vail & Co.t Printers to the Council, 170, Farringdon Road, E.c. BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON COUNCIL AGENDA.—January 3rd 1902. 2. We have considered an application from Mr. A. E. Hitchin, third clerk in the Public Health Department, to be transferred from grade "C" to grade "D" of the scale of salaries as from 1st January 1902 when he will have completed a year's service at the maximum salary of the former grade, viz., £120 per annum. The commencing salary of grade "D" is £126 per annum and having regard to the satisfactory report we have received from the Medical Officer of Health as to the manner in which Mr. Hitchin discharges his duties we recommend— That Mr. A. E. Hitchin be transferred from Grade "C" to grade "D" of the scale of salaries as from the 1st January 1902. 3. We have had under consideration a report from the Borough Engineer with reference to the condition of a sewer at the rear of 60 Junction Road and the adjoining premises, from which it appears that this sewer is choked up and that all the premises which formerly drained into it have been disconnected therefrom and drained into the sewer in Junction Road with the exception of an area at the rear of No. 80. We agree with the opinion expressed by the Borough Engineer that this sewer should be discontinued and we therefore recommend— That, pursuant to the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts, the defective sewer referred to be discontinued and that the drainage of the area at rear of 60 Junction Road be provided for by a drain to be laid therefrom to an existing drain which runs under these premises and discharges into the sewer in Junction Road. 4. We have had under consideration a report from the Medical Officer of Health with reference to the carriage of milk by rail in unsealed or unfastened churns and the consequent danger of its adulteration or the abstraction of cream therefrom whilst in transit. We submit this report as appendix "C," and as we concur in the views expressed therein we are taking steps to give effect to the suggestions of the Medical Officer of Health that a copy of the correspondence between the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Trade and the Railway Association which is attached to his report be forwarded to each vendor of milk in Islington who receives any of his supply by rail; and that representations be made to the Board of Agriculture and the Railway Companies' Association as to the desirability of the latter insisting upon all milk churns carried by them being sealed or locked. ROBERT S. CUFFLIN, Chairman. IX— To consider a report from the Works Committee, dated 23rd December 1901, as follows:— 1. We have, pursuant to your reference of the 6th instant, considered a letter from the Hampstead Borough Council stating that they have directed a communication to be forwarded to the London County Council asking that in all cases where a person intending to build applies to be relieved from exact fulfilment of the provisions of the Building Act, the County Council will communicate with the Borough Council for the purpose of ascertaining their views thereon; and requesting that you support such action. We recommend— That the County Council be asked to communicate all applications for relaxation of the provisions of the Building Act or of any by-laws made thereunder to the Council of the Borough in which such proposed building is situate in order that they may have an opportunity of expressing their views thereon. 2. We have, pursuant to your reference of the 15th November last, considered a letter from the London Chamber of Commerce forwarding suggested modifications of the by-laws proposed to be made by the London County Council for the regulation of lamps, signs and other structures overhanging the public way. We have also considered in connection therewith a letter from Mr. E. Crook referred by you to us on the 6th instant. After careful consideration of both these letters we are of opinion that it is desirable that clause 3, which inter alia regulates the height of any structure from the footway, should be amended so that the minimum height shall not be less than 7 feet 6 inches instead of 8 feet 6 inches as required by the clause, but beyond this we do not think it necessary to suggest alterations in the proposed by-laws as drawn by the London County Council. We recommend— That the London County Council be asked to amend clause 3 of the proposed by laws in the manner referred to and that the London Chamber of Commerce and Mr. E. Crook be informed of the action taken. CHARLES MOFFAT, Chairman. [ 3 ] BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON COUNCIL AGENDA.—January 3rd 1902. X.—To consider a report from the Finance Committee, dated 30th December 1901, as follows: — 1. We have had under consideration applications from Messrs. Robert P. Arnold and Charles S. Crompton, clerks in the Finance Department, to be transferred from grade "B" to grade "C" of the scale of salaries as from 1st January 1902 when they will each have completed one year's service at the maximum salary of the former grade, viz., £85 per annum. The commencing salary of grade "C" is £90 per annum and having regard to the report we have received from the Borough Treasurer as to the manner in which they discharge their duties we recommend— That Messrs. Robert P. Arnold and Charles S. Crompton be transferred from grade " B " to grade " C" of the scale of salaries as from 1st January 1902. 2. We have had under consideration pursuant to your reference of 20th inst. the question of the paving of a portion of Archway Road with basalt setts at an estimated cost of £600. We submit this estimate as being properly chargeable to Capital account and recommend— That application be made to the London County Council for their sanction to the borrowing of this amount.

APPENDIX "C." Report of the Medical Officer of Health referred to in the Report of the Public Health Committee, No. VIII. (4) on Agenda. To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, The Carriage of Milk by Railway in Unsealed or Unfastened Churns. There is a matter of great importance in connection with the carriage of milk by rail, to which I would draw your particular attention. In nearly every prosecution for the adulteration of milk taken against the large vendors, the defence of warranty is raised, but in addition the defendants nearly always declare that the milk was sold as it was received from the farmer. When, however, the latter is appealed to he declares, and I think generally truthfully, that he has not tampered with it, but has sent it to London just as it came from his cows, pure milk with all its cream. The inference therefore naturally arises that it has been tampered with on the railway, an event which I believe to be of very rare occurrence. There could, however, have been no tampering with the churns if they had been locked or sealed. When the vendors or consignors are asked in Court why they did not seal or lock their churns, they invariably declare that the Railway Companies will not allow them to do so, as it would interfere with the examination, the measuring, or the weighing of the contents. In studying the evidence of the Departmental Commission on Milk, I find that this statement is absolutely incorrect, for in a letter dated 29th May 1899 (see correspondence appended hereto) the Assistant Secretary of the Board of Agriculture inquired of the Railway Companies' Association through the Board of Trade if it was their practice to require milk churns to be unlocked, and if in consequence the consignor is unable to take any precautions to prevent persons tampering with their contents, and in reply was informed by the Railway Companies' Association in a communication dated 12th October 1898 and signed by Sir Henry Oakley, that " senders have been for a long time allowed "to send milk in sealed cans, the companies accept the declaration of the senders as to the quantity "conveyed, no extra charge being made ; the only condition the companies require to be fulfilled is "that the tare weight of the cans shall be stamped on the outside of the can, so that in case of doubt "the quantity of milk within the churn can be approximately ascertained by allowing 10¾lbs. for each "gallon of milk declared. It does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the "senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or other"wise fastening the cans." This letter is therefore of the greatest importance as it altogether disposes of the consignors and vendors' contention. If, hitherto, this contention has been made in ignorance of the railway regulations, then the sooner such ignorance is dispelled the better. I therefore suggest that a communication be addressed to each milk vendor in Islington who receives milk by rail, advising him to get it delivered to him in sealed, padlocked or fastened churns; at the same time enclosing a copy of the correspondence laid before the Milk Committee and cautioning him that if hereafter his milk should be found adulterated and a prosecution follow, the fact that he has not availed himself of permissible means to protect the milk supply while in transit will be urged against him, although he may produce a warranty, and that the Court will be asked to say that he has been guilty of contributory negligence. I would further suggest that the Railway Companies carrying milk for Islington purveyors not only in the interest of their servants who are practically looked upon as the delinquents but particularly in that of the public, should insist that all cans sent to them for delivery shall in future be locked, sealed or fastened. I make these two suggestions hoping that you may adopt them and that you may also approach the Railway Companies through the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture with reference to the second. I have not the least doubt that, if the Railway Companies refused to carry milk in unfastened cans, the adulteration of milk would be much checked and the unfortunate farmer would cease to be so frequently, and I believe often undeservedly, made the scapegoat for the large wholesale milk vendors in London and elsewhere. I am, your obedient servant, A. E. HARRIS, Town Hall, Islington, N. Medical Officer of Health. 23rd December, 1901. [ 10 ] BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON COUNCIL AGENDA.—January 3rd 1902. CARRIAGE OF MILK BY RAIL. Copy of Correspondence between the Board of Agriculture, the Board of Trade and the Railway Companies' Association. I. From Assistant Secretary, Board of Agriculture, to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. 20th May 1899. Sir, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture to state, for the information of the Board of Trade, that, in the course of the proceedings on the Sale of Food and Drugs Bill, it has been represented that considerable hardship arises by reason of the prosecution of milk producers in cases in which milk is proved to have been pure when handed over to a railway company for conveyance to the consignee, but is found upon arrival at the station of destination to have been adulterated. The Board are informed that, except in cases in which rates in excess of those usually charged for the conveyance of milk are paid, it is the practice of the railway companies to require that milkchurns delivered to them for conveyance by rail should be unlocked, and the consignor is therefore unable to take any precautions to prevent persons, whether in the employ of the company or not, from having access to or from tampering with the milk while it is in the charge of the company, although he still remains liable to prosecution should the milk be adulterated in transit The Board desire me therefore to invite the observations of the Board of Trade on the subject, and to inquire whether in their judgment it would be feasible to provide any remedy for the complaints referred to. I am, etc., (Signed) P. G. Craigie. II. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Secretary, Board of Agriculture. 17th October 1899. Sir, Adverting to your letter of the 20th May last with reference to the regulations of railway companies respecting the conveyance of milk, and to the question of the liability to prosecution in the event of milk being adulterated in transit, I am directed by the Board of Trade to transmit herewith for the information of the Board of Agriculture a copy of a letter which has been received from the Railway Companies' Association on the subject. I am, etc., (Signed) Francis J. S. Hopwood. Enclosure. From Railway Companies' Association, King's Cross Station, to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. October 12 th 1899. Sir, With reference to your communication (No. R. 7,352) of the 29th May last, enclosing a copy of a letter dated 20th May from the Board of Agriculture, with regard to the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk, and to the question of the liability to prosecution in the event of the milk being adulterated in transit: The railway companies have considered the question, and I am requested to inform you with reference to the statement made in the letter from the Board of Agriculture, that senders have for a long time been allowed to send milk in sealed cans, the companies accept the declaration of the senders as to the quantity conveyed, no extra charge being made; the only condition the companies require tc be fulfilled is that the tare weight of the cans shall be stamped upon the outside of the can, so that in case of doubt the quantity of milk within the churn can be approximately ascertained by allowing 10J lbs. for each gallon of milk declared. It does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or otherwise fastening their cans. I am, etc. (Signed) H. Oakley. III. From Assistant Secretary, Board of Agriculture, to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. 9th November 1899. Sir, Adverting to Mr. Hopwood's letter of the 17th ult. (R. 12,901), and to the enclosure from Sir Henry Oakley on behalf of the Railway Companies' Association, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture to inquire whether they may understand from Sir Henry Oakley's letter that sealed or [ 11 ] BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON COUNCIL AGENDA.—Jannary 3rd 1902. padlocked milk cans are, as a matter of fact, conveyed by the railway companies at the reduced milk rate (at owner's risk), provided that they are stamped with the tare weight of the cans, and that Section 8 of the Companies' Conditions of Carriage does not apply to such cans. With reference to the concluding sentence of Sir Henry Oakley's letter, viz., that it does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or otherwise fastening their cans, I am to point out that the published conditions of the Great Northern Railway contain no provision relating to sealed cans, but, on the contrary, state specifically (Section 8) that the company shall have power to open any cans, a condition that appears to preclude their being securely fastened. I am, etc., (Signed) P. G. Craigie, IV. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Secretary, Board of Agriculture. 24th November 1899. Sir, With reference to Major Craigie's letter of the 9th instant respecting the conveyance of milk by railway companies, I am directed by the Board of Trade to transmit herewith, for the information of the Board of Agriculture, a copy of correspondence which has since taken place between the Railway Companies' Association and the Board of Trade on the subject. I am, etc., (Signed) T. H. W. Pelham. Enclosure No. 1. From Railway Companies' Association to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. ' November 15 th 1899. Sir, With reference to your letter (No. R. 13,936) of the 14th instant and the communication from Mr. Craigie which accompanied it, respecting the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk, and the question of liability tc prosecution in the event of milk being adulterated in transit, I made enquiry before I replied to your letter dated May 20th, and was informed that, as a matter of fact, the railway companies did convey milk in sealed cans, provided they were stamped as required by Clause No. 4 of the railway companies' regulations. With regard to Clause No. 8 of the regulations, the meaning is obvious that if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a can contains a greater quantity of milk than that invoiced, the companies in such cases reserve to themselves power to open the can to ascertain that the quantity therein contained agrees with the quantity declared. It is simply a protective clause there is no reason to exercise if the milk be honestly declared. I am, etc., (Signed) H. Oakley. Enclosure No. 2. From Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade, to Railway Companies' Association. 20th November 1899. Sir, I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, in reply to the letter from the Board of Agriculture of the 9th instant, respecting the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk. I am to state with reference to the first paragraph of your letter that the Board of Agriculture also appear to wish to know if any difference is made in the rates charged for the conveyance of milk when the milk is sent in sealed or padlocked cans. With regard to the second paragraph, I am to enquire if the Board of Agriculture are to understand that the companies reserve to themselves power to open sealed or padlocked cans, though according to your letter of the 12th ultimo when the tare weight is stamped upon the outside of the can the quantity of milk inside could, in case of doubt, be approximately ascertained by allowing 10J lbs. for each gallon of milk declared. I am, etc., (Signed) Francis J. S. Hopwood. Enclosure No. 3. From Railway Companies' Association to Assistant Secretary (Railway Department), Board of Trade. November 21 st 1899. Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of the 20th instant (No. R. 14,232), respecting the communication from the Board of Agriculture on the subject of the regulations of the railway companies for the conveyance of milk. I am informed by all the principal railway companies that they do not make any difference in the charges when sealed cans are used: The companies do reserve the right to open locked cans when there is any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the consignment. I am, etc., (Signed) H. Oakley. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] BOROUGH TREASURER'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT—21ST DECEMBER 1901. Account. Balances at 7th December 1901. Receipts since 7th December 1901.
