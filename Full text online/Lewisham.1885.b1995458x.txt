For the Year ended the 25th March, 1886. The Board submit herewith:— A statement of their Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 25th March, 1886, and of their Assets and Liabilities on that day, with detailed particulars and summary statements of the same. A statement of comparison of Expenditure between the years 1883-4, 1884-5, and 1885-6. A table of Loans from the 1st January, 1856, to the 25th March, 1886. A statement of the contracts entered into by the Board during the year ended 25th March, 1886. The Board also submit the Report of their Medical Officer of Health, for the year ended 31st December, 1885, containing particulars of the population, rate of mortality, and other statistics relating to the general health of the District; and the Report of the Board's Surveyor for the year ended Lady-day, 1886, in which will be found the particulars of the works carried out under his supervision. During the year the Board have paid the sum of £5,429 in reduction of the mortgages owing by them. They have also raised during the same period the sum £2,200 for new permanent works and improvements in the District. The Board are glad to report that the Loans which in past years were raised at 5 per cent. interest have now all been paid off, with the exception of two; the final instalments in respect of these loans will be paid in January, 1887. THE BOARD'S HOSPITAL. This Establishment—for the isolation of infectious diseases—has been maintained throughout the year in a thorough 6 state of efficiency, although, again owing to the healthy state of the district, but few cases have occurred needing isolation. No deaths have taken place in the Hospital during the year. Ratepayers are invited to use this hospital for themselves, or for members of their households, the charge being only one guinea per week, covering medical attendance, board, lodging, and nursing. NEW STREETS AND SEWERS. The various works projected and carried out by the Board under this head will, as in previous years, be found specified in the Surveyor's Report. FIRE PLUG INDICATORS. As stated in previous Reports these indicators are marked upon the gas lamps to indicate the position of the various fire-plugs in the district. The Board again refer to them in this year's Report, feeling assured that this information cannot be too frequently brought before the public. The Board would also call attention to the Fire Alarm Posts which have been placed about the District STREET NAMING, &c. During the year the following Orders have been made by the Metropolitan Board, altering Street names and numbers, and have been duly carried out by this Board: — An Order for re-numbering the houses in Blythe Vale, S.E. (previously called Stoney Lane.) „ for re-numbering the houses in Gilmore Road, Lewisham, and naming the road "Gilmore Road, S.E." „ for re-numbering the houses in the Eastern Section of Eastdown Park, Lewisham, and naming the road "Eastdown Park, S.E." „ for re-naming the Western Section of Eastdown Park. "Wisteria Road, S E.," and for re-numbering the houses there. 7 Orders for re-numbering the houses in Tranquil Vale, Montpelier Vale, and Black heath Vale, and naming those roads respectively— An order for re-numbering the houses in Clarendon Road, Lewisham, and naming that road, "Clarendon Road, S.E." SANITARY. The Sanitary condition of the district continues highly satisfactory. It will be seen from the Report of the Medical Officer for the year appended hereto that the annual rate of mortality in the District was 13.75 per 1000, whilst the annual rate of the whole of London for the like period amounted to 19.0 per 1000, and of Districts outside London 17.5. The number of inhabited houses and the population of the district also continue to increase, as shewn by the Table in the Medical Officer's Report The number in each case, at Midsummer, 1885, being— Inhabited houses 13,090 Estimated population 82,000 The Return (Table VI.), shows the number of complaints brought under the notice of the Committees, and the proceedings taken thereon. The Slaughter-houses, Cowhouses, and Fishmongers' premises, have been periodically inspected by the Board's Sanitary Officers. Under this head the Board wish again to mention a sanitary matter to which considerable time and attention is devoted by the Board's Committees and their Officers, as being a matter of great importance to the health of a growing community, viz, the collection and removal of Dust, &c. The cost of this work exceeds £2200 per annum, and as the price obtained by the Board for the refuse is declining this cost must grow, but every effort is made, without unduly increasing the expenditure, to keep the district as clear from dust as possible. 8 The Board again urgently request all householders to see that the men are not refused the dust on calling, and that any vegetable, animal, or other matter, which may be burnt or otherwise destroyed, is not placed in the ashpits. They would also call attention to the necessity of having the ashbins periodically cleansed and limewashed, or limewhited. It frequently happens that this most needful work is absolutely overlooked and neglected, even when houses are otherwise completely renovated. Any complaints of the non-clearance of ashpits may be made by letter to the Board, at their Offices, when attention will be given to the same; but it is apparent that the Board cannot collect the dust more frequently than at present without incurring a much heavier outlay. BAKEHOUSES. The inspection and control of Bakehouses has again been placed in the hands of the Local Authorities. The Board feeling the necessity for such inspection and control, pressed upon the higher authorities the importance of allowing it to revert to the Local Governing Bodies, and this result the Board are glad to say, has been attained. By the 17th sec. of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1883, it is provided: "As respects every retail bakehouse, the provisions of the Act, and of sects. 3, 34, 35, and 35 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, which relate to cleanliness, ventilation, overcrowding, and other sanitary conditions, should be enforced by the local authority of the district in which the bakehouse is situate, and not by an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878, and that for the purpose of such section it was enacted that the Medical Officer of Health should have and exercise all such powers of entry, inspection, taking legal proceedings and otherwise, as an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878." 9 RATEABLE VALUE. The Rateable Value of the District at the end of the year 1884, was— Lewisham £417,367 Penge 161,864 Total £579,231 The usual valuation at the end of the year 1885 was not made known to this Board, as the new Quinquennial Valuation would come into force early in the ensuing year. This valuation is as follows:— Lewisham £443,502 Penge 165,375 £608,877 Since the passing of the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, which provides for a Quinquennial Valuation of the Metropolis, the Rateable Value of this District, as stated each five years, has been as follows:— 1871. Lewisham 266,936 Penge 128,430 395,366 1876. Lewisham 324,009 Penge 128,430 452,439 1881. Lewisham 376,087 Penge 152,220 528,307 1886. Lewisham 443,502 Penge 165,375 608,877 EXPENDITURE. As this Board has to collect and pay over to the different Metropolitan Boards very considerable sums in the course of the year, it may be well to note that the actual amount required by this Board during the year under review for its own purposes, from the Local Guardians of the Poor of the 10 Parish of Lewisham, was only the sum of £33,646, being equivalent to a rate, on the Rateable Value in force at the commencement of the year, of a fraction over 1s. 7d. in the pound, while the rates levied for the same period for all purposes in the Parish of Lewisham amounted to 5s. 7d. in the pound. The amount so required from the Overseers of the Hamlet of Penge was £9,415, being equivalent to a rate of a fraction under 1s. 2d. in the pound, out of an amount of 5s. 5d. in the pound levied in the Hamlet. The amounts which the Board raised for Metropolitan bodies, and paid over to them, were:—For the Metropolitan Board, £17,913; for the School Board, £21,144. The Metropolitan Board's Precept for the year ending 31st December, 1886, and embracing a portion of the year now under review, is £253 less than the sum thus required; and that of the London School Board for the same period is £1,540 more than the amount raised for their purposes in the past year; but owing to the increased Quinquennial Valuation, this sum will be raised without a corresponding increase in the rate per pound. SALE OF FOOD, &c., ACTS. Notwithstanding the facilities offered, enabling the ratepayers to avail themselves of these Acts for the detection of adulteration of food, milk, &c., very few have taken advantage thereof. Full particulars of these facilities, as given in a public notice issued by the Board, are set out in previous Reports; and for convenience the Board again repeat the same:— The Notice referred to. "The attention of the Board having been called to the desirability of giving greater facilities than at present exist to the general public in aid of the working of 'The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts,' they have now made arrangements with the Public Analyst of the District, Mr. C. Heisch, of 79, Mark Lane, E.C., whereby samples and articles desired by any resident in the District to be analysed may be left with the Secretary of the Board during office hours, at their Offices, and no further trouble 11 in the matter need then fall on such resident, as, in the event of such sample proving upon analysis to be adulterated, the resident is not compelled to prosecute the seller. A fee of 2s. 6d., which must be paid at once, will be charged for each sample brought by a resident for analysis, the balance of the analyst's fee of 10s. 6d. will be paid by the Board. "Care should be taken that the samples brought for analysis are in the same condition as when bought. The name and address of the seller must be supplied, and the buyer must sign the proper form, which will be prepared at the Board's Offices. All samples received for analysis are accepted in strict confidence, and the result will be communicated to the buyer direct by post. "The only expense to the buyer is the payment of the beforementioned fee of 2s. 6d. "If residents within the District have reasonable grounds for suspecting any seller of adulterating, they may write to the Board, giving the name and address of the seller and the article suspected and enclosing a double fee of 5s., when the Board will direct their Inspectors of Nuisances to take the necessary steps for obtaining an analysis without further reference or expense to the resident; and if the article is found to be adulterated further steps will be taken by the Board. Such communications will also be received in strict confidence. No notice can be taken of anonymous communications, although the fee may be enclosed." PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. The only scheme of which notice was given this year was the Southwark and Yauxhall Water Works Bill, for forming a reservoir at Forest Hill, which Bill subsequently passed through Parliament and received the Royal assent. REPRESENTATION AT METROPOLITAN BOARD. As stated in the last Report, the Board had long been agitating at the Metropolitan Board of Works for a direct representation thereat, it being considered unsatisfactory and unjust to the interests of so large a district as this, contributing so large a sum for Metropolitan purposes, that it 12 should have no representative at such Board other than one jointly with the Plumstead Board, under which arrangement a member of the Plumstead Board had been elected for many years past, and failing redress from the Metropolitan Board of Works, Mr. Hughes, the Representative of the joint Boards of Plumstead and Lewisham, proposed to prepare a short Bill with the object of giving separate representation to this Board and the Plumstead Board, and also giving increased representation to some of the other Vestries and District Boards of London who had applied for the same. This course was adopted, and ultimately Viscount Lewisham, M.P., took charge of the Bill, which was read a first time on the 24th April, 1885, and after such Bill had been largely amended in Committee, by increasing the number of Vestries and District Boards who were entitled to increased representation, and which amendments were accepted by Viscount Lewisham, the Bill was duly passed by the Houses of Parliament on the 6th July, and received the Royal Assent on the 31st July, 1885. Under its provisions, this Board was entitled to elect a separate Member to represent them at the Metropolitan Board, and on the 23rd September last, Mr. Theo. W. Williams, the then Chairman of the Meetings of the Board, was elected its first Representative at the Metropolitan Board of Works. THE UNEMPLOYED. During the past winter this Board, as well as other public authorities in London, was much exercised by the necessity of taking some steps for the relief of the unemployed workmen in the District. With this object they determined to expedite certain works which they had in view, and thus afford immediate work, and instead of following their usual custom of having all new streets formed and made by Contractors, in which case the labour is generally brought by such contractor into the District from a distance, they determined to make such roads under their own immediate supervision, and employ 13 the labour from their own neighbourhood. For the purpose of ascertaining the probable amount of work required, they advertised for those seeking work, and willing to accept 4d. per hour, to leave their names and addresses with the Board. By this means the Board received about 185 names, and in addition some 144 names were sent in by the different relief Committees working in the neighbourhood; and the Board were much relieved to find that the number of unemployed in the District was not so great as was anticipated, the total number of names received being only 329 out of a population exceeding 75,000. Moreover, upon testing the lists, it was found that very many, especially amongst the lists sent in by the Relief Committees, had either obtained work or were not willing to accept the Board's offer of 4d. per hour, e.g., out of the first ten called to work only three put in an appearance in answer. Nevertheless, the Board carried out and completed seven New Streets, at a cost of about £3,800, thus affording work to a large number of persons in the District, and from an examination of the roads it would appear that the work done was fully equal, if not superior, to the work usually done by the Contractors. At times of distress the public frequently call upon the Local authority to provide relief works for the unemployed, but it must be remembered that nearly all the work which a Local authority, such as the Board, can provide, requires skilled work, and that is not the description of labour which is generally unemployed at times of distress, and that the making of roads is about the only work which can be put in hand with the view of meeting such need; and as the distress generally arises in a hard winter, it must also not be forgotten that, during severe frosts, road making cannot be carried on. DEPUTATIONS. During the year the Board have appointed Members to attend several deputations and conferences called for the discussion of different questions affecting the general wellbeing of the Metropolis. 14 PARLIAMENTARY BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM. The consideration of the proposal of the Government to constitute a Parliamentary Borough of Lewisham, under the Redistribution of Seats Bill, continued into the year now under review. As stated in the last Report, the Bill proposed that such Parliamentary Borough should consist of the whole of the District of the Lewisham Board of Works, with the Parish of Lee added thereto, but subsequently the Hamlet of Penge made strong efforts to be separated from the Borough of Lewisham and placed in Camberwell, on the ground that the Borough of Lewisham was in Kent, and the Hamlet was in Surrey, and as the population of the proposed Borough was much above the average, amounting to 84,000, such efforts were ultimately successful, although this Board felt bound to oppose them. This Board also endeavoured to obtain the Beckenham Sewerage Area to be included in the proposed Parliamentary Borough, as this area, commonly called the Beckenham tongue of land, separates the District like a wedge, and it was felt that great difficulty would be experienced by the ratepayers in ascertaining in which Parliamentary Borough they were situate, but as such Sewerage Area was not within the boundary of the Metropolis such application failed. The Parliamentary Borough of Lewisham, therefore, now consists simply of the Parishes of Lewisham and Lee. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS AND OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. During the year the Board have adopted Regulations under the provisions of the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and these regulations have been confirmed by the Local Government Board. Such Regulations are printed and can be seen at the Board's Offices. The same apply to all houses let in lodgings, with the following exceptions:— (a) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any 15 charge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 6s. per week: (b) Where for the purpose of any rate for the relief of the poor the rateable value of the house exceeds £30, and the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and exclusive of any eharge for the use by such lodger of any furniture, shall be such that the amount accruing due in any term shall be at the rate or in the proportion of not less than 7s. 6d. per week. AUDIENCES OF THE BOARD. The following amended Bye-Laws were made and confirmed by the Board on the 13th February, 1884:— "Interviews. "I. A personal interview shall not be granted by the Board to any person or number of persons at any Meeting of the Board unless a written application be made at least 48 hours before the time of Meeting, stating the object of the interview; and the same, if granted, shall take place at a quarter after Five o'clock in the afternoon, or at such other time as the Board may from time to time appoint. "II. That upon any such interview being so granted to any person or number of persons, or to a deputation, such person or persons, or deputation, shall be required to be introduced by a Member of the Board, and one person only of any such number of persons or deputation attending shall be allowed to address the Board upon the subject of the interview, and thereupon the same shall be referred to a Committee, or be otherwise dealt with as may be deemed expedient." THE ANNUAL INSPECTION. It has been the custom of the Board for many years to make an Annual Inspection of the District. As will be remembered the District consists of the Parish of Lewisham, divided into three Wards, returning in all 21 Members, and 16 of the Hamlet of Penge, returning six Members; and it may be imagined that the Members thus returned in many instances are not well acquainted with the other parts of the District, therefore it has been found of the utmost use that each Member should, at least once a year, visit the different parts of this widely-extended District, and be able to inspect the various works in progress or in contemplation; they are then in a position to bring personal knowledge to aid them in the discussion of the necessity or otherwise of the proposed works.

WILKINSON, Medical Officer of Health for the District. Gentlemen, The population of the Lewisham District, as estimated at the middle of the year 1885, amounted to 82,000, occupying 13,090 houses. The population in 1881, at the time of the census, was ascertained to be 71,715. Births. The Registered Births in the District in the year 1885 amounted to 2,451, of which 92, or 3.7 per cent., were illegitimate. Males 1,220. Females 1,231. The Birth Rate to population was 29.87 per 1,000. In London 132,506 births were registered, the Birth Rate being 32G per 1,000, the lowest since 1800. In England and Wales 893,694 births were registered, the birth rate being 33 5 per 1,000. 2 Deaths. The number of Deaths registered in the Lewisham District during the year 1885 was 1,128, being 18 more than the number registered during the previous year. The annual rate of mortality was 13.75 per 1,000. During the same period the annual rate of mortality of England and Wales was 19.0, showing a reduction of 0.6 per 1,000, as compared with 1884. The death rate of London was 19.0, showing a decrease of 0.6 per 1,000, and being the lowest on record, while the death rate in the "Outer Ring" of suburban districts, with a population slightly exceeding a million, did not exceed 17.5 per 1,000, and corresponded with the rate of the preceding year. The death rate in the twenty-seven large towns, excluding London, with an aggregate population of over 42 millions, was 20.1, ranging between 17.1 in Brighton, and 271 in Preston. Marriages. During the year 1885 there were 397 Marriages in the Parish of Lewisham, of which 319 were solemnised in the various Churches, 33 in Dissenting Chapels, and 45 at the Registrar's Office. During the same period there were 134 in the hamlet of Penge, of which 110 were solemnised in Churches, 14 in Dissenting Chapels, and 10 at the Registrar's Office. Total 531, as compared with 503 in the previous year. The marriage rate was equal to 129 per 1,000. The marriage rate in the country generally was 14.4 per 1,000, equal to the lowest on record. In London the marriage rate was 169, the lowest as yet recorded. 3 Table I. gives the estimate 1 population, the number of inhabited houses, and the births, deaths, and marriages which have taken place in the District during the year 1885 and the 10 previous years. Table II. gives the annual rate of mortality, death rates amongst children, and death rates at the public institutions in the District for the same periods. Table III. gives the deaths registered at several groups of ages from different causes during the year. Table IV. gives the mortality from certain classes of diseases, and the proportion to population, and to 1,000 deaths in 1885. Table V. gives the number of deaths in the 10 years, 1875 to 1884 inclusive, from the seven principal zymotic diseases, and the number in the year 1885. Table VI. The Inspectors' Reports of the sanitary work completed during the year. Table VII. gives the number of inhabited houses, the estimated population in 1885, with the birth and death rate in the Registrar's Sub-districts in the Lewisham Parish, and the Hamlet of Penge, together comprising "the Lewisham District." Table VIII. A Register of the licensed cow-houses in the District, together with a list of the milk sellers in the District who have no licensed cow-houses. Table IX. A list of the licensed slaughter-houses in the District. The decrease in the death rate from zymotic diseases may be attributed to the diminished fatality ot whooping cough and measles, and the entire absence of any deaths irom 4 scarlet fever, which was, nevertheless, prevalent in a mild form. A serious outbreak of smallpox occurred at Penge during the month of May. Upwards of 38 cases were recorded, the majority of which were removed to the Smallpox Hospitals, though five died at their own houses. The number of deaths in Public Institutions was above the average. Of a total of 101, 94 occurred in the Lewisham Workhouse, the majority being old and infirm persons, as were the three who died at the Waterman's Asylum ; the remaining four were children, three at the North Surrey Schools, and one at the Sick Children's Home, Sydenham. Inquests were held in 44 cases. The causes of death were returned as follows:— Natural causes 23 Violent deaths— Accidcntal 15 Suicidal 4 Homicidal 2 — 21 44 Eleven deaths were recorded as "Not Certified," no inquest being considered necessary by the Coroner after inquiry. Meteorology. The mean temperature of the air at Greenwich in 1885 was 48.6° Fahreinheit, or 0.7° below the average of 40 years. The highest reading by day, 90.2°, was registered in the 5 week ending August 1st, and the lowest reading by night 22.3° in the week ending January 24th. Rain fell on 100 days, the total amount of rainfall being 24 inches, 6inchcs more than in the previous year, but 1.28 inches less than the average. Water Supply. The water supplied to this District by tho various Companies continues to be of good quality, that of the Kent Company being remarkably clear and free from impurity. It is important for consumers to see that their cisterns are properly covered and periodically cleansed; also that they have no direct communication with the drain by means of the waste pipe.

SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of Work executed from Lady-day 1885, to Lady-day, 1886. Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in submitting my Report on the several works executed and the general business transacted in my department during the past financial year, such being my Seventeenth Annual Report. HIGHWAYS. From the following Table may be seen the quantity of material paid for during the year for the maintenance of the Public Roads. Division. Granite. Port Philip Stone. Dug Flints. Picked Flints. Gravel. Total. Lewisham Pariah (cubic yards) 3831 1396 3015 ... 1408 9650 Hamlet of Penge (ditto) 730 ••• ... 740 705 2175 Total 4561 1396 3015 740 2113 11,825 The Rainfall, as recorded by the rain-guage at the Forest Hill Stone Yard from the 20th March, 1885, to the 25th March, 1886, inclusive, was as follows:— Number of days on which rain fell. INCHES. 0 1885 March 2Gth to 31st inclusive 0.00 10 „ April 1.82 17 „ May 1.94 8 „ June 1.33 1 „ July 0.36 9 „ August 1.04 17 „ September 4.02 17 „ October 2.87 15 „ November 2.69 8 „ December 0.98 14 1886 January 3.26 0 „ February 0.66 6 „ March, to 25th inclusive 0.42 128 21.39 2 This shews an increase of 4.35 inches over the rainfall of last year, although rain fell on 9 days less than last year. The rainfall was not excessive, but on account of the long continuance of frost, with snow, rain, and thaws intervening, the year was by no means a good one for the maintenance of roads. From the commencement of January to the middle of March there was almost continuous frost, and during this period it froze for upwards of sixty nights. The records of the London Skating Club show that there was skating on the Club waters in Regent's Park on 38 days during the winter. The roads in many places, from continual frost, &c., technically speaking, became rotten, but notwithstanding this they have been maintained during the year with a less quantity of material than last year, and are at the present time in good condition. The snow gave a large amount of additional work in sweeping paths, &c. The heaviest fall took place upon the 6th of January. There were also heavy storms upon the 11th, 23rd, and 25th January. Upon the three last-mentioned dates the following lengths of paths were cleared in each case between the hours of seven a.m. and seven p.m.:— MILES. Blackheath and Lewisham 19¾ Sydenham and Forest Hill 35 Penge 12½ Miles 67¼ Portions of the gutters and the gullies were cleared in addition to this. The roads and paths were also sanded or ashes laid on during the frosts, which caused a good deal of extra work. In fact it happened more than once that sand or ashes laid on the roads at seven o'clock in the morning had to be removed before night, owing to a thaw, and put 011 again the next morning. The cost of removing snow from the paths, &c., during the winter, was— £ s. d. Blackheath and Lewisham 114 6 9 Sydenham and Forest Hill 194 16 11 Penge 70 3 4 £379 7 0 The difficulty of obtaining shoots for slop of road detritus has not been overcome, and in many cases the slop has to be taken some distance to get rid of it. 3 ROAD WATERING. Nearly the whole of the work of watering the roads at Blackhcath was executed by Mr. George Trew, of Catford, at a contract price of 8s. fid. per horse, harness, and driver, per day. The watering of Lewisham, Catford, &c., was chiefly carried out by the Board's own horses and men, the rest being done by Mr. Sabin, of Rushey Green, at a contract price of 8s. Gd. per horse, harness, and driver per day. In Upper Sydenham and Forest Hill, Mr. C. Pearce, of Forest Hill, supplied horses, harness, and drivers at 8s. 3d. per day. Mr. Hutchings supplied the horses, harness, and men at 8s. Gd. per.day in the Lower Sydenham Division. In the Hamlet of Penge, Mr. Winnifrith supplied horses, harness, and drivers at 7s. 6d. per day. The Board in all cases supplied the vans or carts. From the following Table can be seen the length of miles watered in each Division:— Locality . Miles. Yards.

There are now in the Parish of Lewisham 696 lamps lighted by the South Metropolitan Gas Company, and 743 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. There are in the Hamlet of Penge 369 lamps lighted by the Crystal Palace District Gas Company. The charges for the ordinary street lamps, including lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, painting, &c., are— The South Metropolitan Gas Company, £3 9s. per lamp per annum, and the Crystal Palace District Gas Company, £3 9s. 2d. per lamp per annum. The South Metropolitan Gas Company reduced the price at Lady Day 1886, 3s. 6d. per lamp per annum, and the Crystal 4 Mace District Gas Company, 1s. 7d. per lamp per annum at Midsummer last. The following list shews the new lamps erccted:- Lewisham Parish.

During the year the Board determined to carry out, by the unemployed labour in the District, as far as possible, the following New Streets:— Lewisham Parish. Church Road, Hither Green Lane (2nd and 3rd parts), Park Road, Kent House Road (1st part), and Kneller Road (2nd part). Hamlet of Penge. Padua Road. They are now in progress, and will soon be completed. Of course carrying out these works without a contractor creates a great deal of additional labour. The Mansion House Fund provided a sum of £75, to be expended in labour in carrying out any improvement not contemplated by the Board, which was spent in lowering some of the gradients ot Hither Green Lane. 10 SEWERS AND HOUSE DRAINAGE.

I wrote two Reports upon the subject, which will be found upon the Board's Minutes, and which were ordered to be printed and copies sent to the members of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis. From these Reports it will appear that the most important suggestions made by the Metropolitan Board of Works had been carried out for vcars in this District. Two large tanks for flushing sewers were constructed, one in Perry Vale, to hold 5,000 gallons of water, and the other at the top of the Beckenham Road, Penge, to hold 4,000 gallons. There arc other tanks now in course of construction in the District. The Perry Vale tank has an 18-inch syphon, and discharges the 5,000 gallons in about 35 seconds. I believe this syphon to be larger than any other in use in the Kingdom for flushing purposes. The syphon at the Beckenham Road is 14 inches, and discharges in 28 seconds. Both syphons were made by Mr. E. R. Palmer, of Beckenham. The usual amount of flushing was done by means of water carts, the water being mixed with permanganate of potash for that purpose, and the larger sewers gone through and cleansed from all deposit by the flushing men at regular periods. During the summer there were fewer complaints of ventilators smelling than last year. I cannot help thinking the continual flushing and cleansing of the sewers conduces to a large extent to our low death rate and good sanitary condition. A constant inspection of the Perry Vale Sewer was made, and a register kept of the temperature of the liquid flowing from Messrs. Morgan's brewery into that sewer. There was an improvement, but the temperature was not as low at times as I should wish. The old barrel Sewer in the London Road, from the junction of Honor Oak Road to the boundary, was found to be falling in, and it was necessary to lay a new 15-inch pipe in the road, in substitution of it. It was determined to erect a ventilating shaft about the middle of the Ivy Lane sewer, with a furnace to burn coke, as an experiment. The work is being proceeded with. The drainage 12 of the Priory Estate, upon the Bromley Road, gave a great deal of trouble. Two summonses were taken for allowing overflows from cesspools, and convictions obtained. NEW ROADS. No Roads were made during the year of any great importance, as a means of communication. SURFACE WATER DRAINAGE. The following Table shows the Surface Water Drains sanctioned:— Locality.

PARLIAMENTARY SCHEMES. South Eastern (Various Powers) Bill. The result of the opposition of the Board to this scheme is on doubt known to the Members. I dovoted a great deal of time to getting up evidence, and preparing plans to a large scale of all the bridges interfered with. Mr. B. Baker and myself were examined and gave evidence before the Committee of the Commons, and the Board obtained a clause obliging the Company to widen the extended bridges, and to construct them as noiseless and watertight as possible. A pledge was also given that a station should be constructed between the High Street and Hither Green junction. The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company deposited Plans, &c., to construct a Reservoir at Forest Hill, and this work will probably be shortly taken in hand. FLOODING, FRONTAGE LINES, &c. I am glad to say no flooding occurred during the year of any consequence. Twenty-seven applications were sent from the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works for 13 suggestions, and I attended the Building Act Committee in almost all the cases. There were 137 notices sent to builders and others for commencing to build without giving notice, and several summonses were taken out for various offences coming under my jurisdiction. One hundred and thirty-six plans and tracings were prepared in my office, and a great many estimates made and reports and letters written. Appended to this Report is a List of the New Streets sanctioned. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient humble Servant, JOHN CARLINE, C.E., Mem. San. Inst., Surveyor to the Board.
