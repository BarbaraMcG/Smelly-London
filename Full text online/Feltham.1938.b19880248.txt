June, 1939. 1 Council Offices, Feltham May 15th, 1939 Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present to you the Yearly Report on the Health and Sanitation of your District during 1938. The District is divided into three Wards: Bedfont, Feltham, and Hanworth, with a total acreage of 4,935. The estimated population is 30,450 (mid. 1938), (Registrar General). The day population is increased by people working at the various factories and shops. A small number continue to work at agriculture. The Southern Railway employ a considerable number. The population is increasing by about 2,000 a year. They are attracted by the new houses which are being built. The majority of them earn their livings outside your area. Unemployment is slight. There are no slums. My estimate of the population is 45,000. The number of inhabited houses at the end of 1938 was 10,079. The sum represented by a penny rate is £940. All classes of inhabited houses 10,079 Working class dwellings 9,397 New working-class dwellings erected 747 Total number of new houses erected 830 2 Vital Statistics Live births— Total Male Female Legitimate 742 395 347 Illegitimate 20 11 9 Total 762 406 356 Birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident poulation—25.02 Still births— Legitimate 22 15 7 Illegitimate 1 0 1 Total 23 15 8 Birth rate per 1,000 total births (live and still)—25.07 Deaths— Death rate per 1,000 of the estimated resident population 7.4 Death from Puerperal causes (Headings 29 and 30 of the Registrar General's short list) .06 Death rate per 1,000 total (live and still births) 29.02 Death rate per 1,000 No. 29 Puerperal Sepsis 0.27 Death rate per 1,000 No. 30 Other Puerperal causes 0.27 Death rate of Infants under 1 year All infants per 1,000 live births 53.8 Legitimate infants per 1,000 live births 48.3 Illegitimate infants 2.6 Deaths from Measles, all ages 1.0 Deaths from Diarrhoea, under 2 years 7.0 Deaths from Whooping Cough, all ages 0.0 Deaths from Cancer, all ages 23.0 The Birth and Death rate for England and Wales in 1938 were— Live Births Still Births Birth Rate 15.1 0.60 Death Rate 11.6 Maternal Mortality for England and Wales were— Puerperal Sepsis per 1,000 0.86 Others 2.19 Total 2.97 3 Causes of Death in your Area.

The majority of new cases are among new inhabitants who were already infected with the disease before coming to live in this neighbourhood. The notification is efficient. No immunization against diphtheria is undertaken in your district. 5 Nursing in the Home There is a District Nurse for Feltham and Hanworth, and a separate one for Bedfont. Illness other than Hospital cases are attended by these nurses and by private nurses, and by the relatives of the patients. Midwives Eight midwives are resident in your area, and others from surrounding districts attend cases. All are under the supervision of the Middlesex County Council . Laboratory Facilities Sputums for examination for Tuberculosis are sent to the Middlesex County Council Dispensary at Hounslow. Swabs for Diphtheria and other infectious material are sent to the Royal Hospital at Richmond. Hospitals Acute cases are taken to Hounslow, Richmond, Windsor, and Staines Hospitals. Some cases, especially maternity, are admitted to the West Middlesex Hospital at Isleworth. The arrangements are satisfactory. Maternity Homes One is licensed in your District. It is supervised by the Middlesex County Council and is satisfactory. Ambulance Facilities An ambulance is stationed at Council Offices. It is available day and night. Infectious cases are removed by Special Ambulance belonging to the Staines Joint Isolation Hospital. Clinic and Treatment Centres The School Medical Officer appointed by the Middlesex County Council holds sessions once or twice a week at Bedfont, Feltham, and Hanworth. The children are inspected. Expectant and nursing mothers are advised. Free milk and other articles are issued free in necessitous cases, and others obtain them at half, or cost price. Children from 1 to 5 years old are visited at their homes. The arrangements are adequate. A new Clinic has been built during the year. It is situated in Cardinal Road, Feltham, and it is modern and satisfactory in design. 6 Orthopaedic Treatment Cases are sent to the various hospitals by the School Medical Officer, or by private practitioners. Milk Supply All dairies, cowsheds, and milkshops are periodically inspected and action taken where necessary. Samples of milk are taken for analysis. There are 8 dairies in your area. They are clean and well kept. The milk is of good quality. Sanitary Circumstances of the Area Water Supply Water is supplied to Bedfont and Feltham by the South West Suburban Water Co. of Egham, and to Hanworth by the Metropolitan Water Board. A few houses are still supplied by wells; these houses should be connected to the main. The water has been analysed during the year on eight occasions. The reports are satisfactory, and the supply adequate. Arrangements were made during the year by which the results of analyses of water made in the area supplied by the South West Suburban Water Co. were pooled . Rivers and Streams The River Crane passes through your District. It is contaminated outside your boundary. There is a nuisance from insects breeding along the banks. The whole river requires canalizing both within and without your District. This has partially been done by the Middlesex County Council in the Hanworth Ward. Drainage Almost the whole of the District, with the exception of Hatton, is on the main sewer. Details are given in the report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector. Swimming Baths There are no swimming baths in your area. A paddling pool was opened in June, 1937. The water is cleansed daily. There have been no complaints with regard to the water. 7 Closet Accommodation 38 pail closets have been abolished during the year. The drainage of 31 houses has been re-constructed. 33 cesspools have been abolished. Approximately 20 pail closets remain to be converted. Camping Sites There are no camping sites in your area and no licences for same have been issued. Public Cleansing See Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report. Shops The Shops' Act, 1912-1936, have been carried out by this Department. Details in Chief Sanitary Inspector's Report. Smoke Abatement No complaints received during the year. Schools The water supply is from the main and is satisfactory. The drainage is to the main sewer. All cases of infectious disease are notified to the Headmaster or Headmistress. The cases and their contacts are excluded. Eradication of Bed Bugs (1) The number of Council houses infested 26 The number of Council houses disinfested 26 The number of other houses infested 27 The number of other houses disinfested 27 (2) The methods employed of freeing infested houses from bugs are the removal of all wood-work and spraying with chemicals—Pyagra or Cimex. (3) All belongings inspected before removal to Council houses and if necessary treated with insectide. (4) The work of disinfection is carried out by the local authority. In a few cases a specialist firm was engaged to fumigate with Hydrogen Cyanide Gas. 8 Housing During 1938, 830 new houses were erected, of which 747 were working-class dwellings. There is still a demand for houses to be let at a weeklyrental of 10/- or less. Under the new Overcrowding Laws, houses for the working-class, with 4 or 5 bedrooms, will have to be provided. There are no slums in your area, other than those that are scheduled for clearance. For details of Inspections, see Appendix "A." In conclusion, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to thank you for the way in which you have supported me in carrying out my duties, and to thank Mr. Rowdon, Mr. Bell, and the other Officials of the Council for their assistance. F. H. WOODS, Medical Officer of Health 9 Annual Report of the Chief Sanitary Inspector for the year ended December 31st, 1938 Council Offices, Feltham To Dr. F. H. WOOODS, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. Medical Officer of Health Sir, I have the honour to present to you my Eighth Annual Report dealing with the work carried out during the year 1938, in conection with the administration of the various statutes and byelaws relating to Public Health in force within the District. The building trade, although somewhat slower than of previous years, continues. Houses and flats to let appear to be in demand. I anticipate development at North Bedfont when a sewerage system is provided. It was necessary to take proceedings by way of summons in one case only in connection with Sunday Trading. Costs were allowed. As in previous years I have been enabled to obtain the desired end without taking legal proceedings. Personal interviews with either the owners or agents of properties lead to the necessary works of cleansing, repairs, and drainage being executed. Drainage of existing houses The drainage to thirty-one properties have been reconstructed. Thirty-three existing cesspools have been filled in with suitable material or used for receiving roof and yard water after having been cleaned out. Thirty-eight pail closets have been abolished. In addition, the drainage and closet accommodation at the Old Church Schools, Bedfont, has been reconstructed. Sewerage and sewage disposal. The position is as that in the previous Annual Report with the exception that the sewer has been extended in Twickenham Road, Hanworth. 10 House refuse collection This work has been regularly carried out with the Council's four S. & D. Freighters. In my report to the Public Health Committee on September 13th, 1938, I gave the cost as being Collection 8/5½d. per ton, Disposal l/3d. per ton, total 9/8½d. per ton as compared with 10/3d. per ton for the year 1937. Cesspool cleansing This work receives prompt attention, the number of cesspools lessening each year. By request of the Sunbury Urban District Council this Council undertook the emptying of cesspools in the Sunbury Urban District on payment. Milk supply There are no cowsheds in the area, the milk being brought into the District. There are six dairymen in the Register who supply milk in the District, but whose place of business is outside the District, and four retailers are licensed to sell Tuberculin Tested milk, also four retailers for Pasteurised milk. One person is licensed to pasteurise milk. Slaughterhouse and meat There are eight slaughterhouses licensed in the District, and also one knacker's yard. The whole are kept in a clean condition. Under the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, persons have been licensed to slaughter certain animals in slaughterhouses and knackers' yards. Other food premises Other premises where food is prepared have been inspected. No objection has been raised by the various proprietors in having his premises and goods inspected, in fact they have shown a desire to co-operate with the department by sending for me when they have been in possession of articles of food which they considered were in a doubtful condition. Complaints have been made of articles of food purchased and brought to me, but as several hours have elapsed between the time of purchasing and the articles reaching me, I have not been able to prove definitely that such was unsound or unfit at the time of purchase. However, I have on each occasion visited the shops concerned and interviewed the manager or his supervisor and cautioned them. 11 Butchers shops There are twenty-five shops in the District. The whole are provided with moveable glass fronts which can be replaced during time of dust being blown about. The shops are kept in a clean condition, including the refrigerators. Housing Act, 1936—Overcrowding The Council has taken practicable steps to deal with each individual case, and in seventeen cases remedied the overcrowding. Fried fish shops With the exception of one shop the whole are up to date having the latest type of frying range. No complaints have been received respecting the manner in which the trade is carried on. Ice cream premises The registration of these premises will come into force in October, 1939. The premises have been inspected of those persons who have forwarded registration forms. Rats and Mice destruction All complaints received from private persons as to the presence of these vermin have been forwarded to the department concerned of the County Council of Middlesex. On a few occasions I have met the Officer concerned upon certain premises. Rivers, streams, ponds and ditches Under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health several ponds and ditches were sprayed with oil, to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. One well was closed during the year. Disinfestation The electric sprayer purchased has proved very satisfactory in dealing with bugs. Housing Act, 1936—Clearance Orders This Inquiry was held by W. E. Kelly, Esq., A.R.I.B.A. the Inspector of the Ministry of Health, on the 3rd May, 1938. There were ten Clearance Orders. I accompanied the Inspector when he inspected each house. The Council were successful in each case. This report would not be complete unless I again express • my thanks to you, the Chairman and Members of the Council, and to my staff of the Department. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, R. J.
