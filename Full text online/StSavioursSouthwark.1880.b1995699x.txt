Nearly two years haying elapsed since the Metropolis Management (Thames River Prevention of Floods) Amendment Act was passed, empowering the Metropolitan Board of Works to enforce the raising of the walls and banks of the River Thames, within the Metropolis, and the execution of the necessary works to prevent the overflow of the River, and no plans or specifications having been delivered in conformity with the provisions of the Act, either to the owners of riverain property or to this Board, the Board, in April last, caused a letter to be addressed to the Metropolitan Board, pointing out the great inconvenience and loss to which owners of riverside property are subjected in consequence of the delay, and strongly urging upon the Board the necessity of 4 proceeding with the preparation of the required plans and specifications. In reply, the Metropolitan Board stated that the work of survey, so far as the St. Saviour's District is concerned, was in a forward state, and was being proceeded with as fast as possible; but up to tho present time the plans have not been delivered. Street Nomenclature. In compliance with an application on the part of this Board, the Metropolitan Board of Works has ordered that, for the purpose of distinguishing the same, the several houses and premises in the line of thoroughfare extending from Southwark Street to Southwark Bridge Road, and known by the names of Gravel Lane, Great Guildford Street, and Sumner Street, in the respective Parishes of Christchurch and St. Saviour, Southwark, shall bo re-numbered; that the names Gravel Lane and Great Guildford Street (so far as applies to the line of thoroughfare above described) shall be abolished, and that the whole line of thoroughfare shall be called Sumner Street, S.E. It has also been ordered that, for the like purpose, the several houses and premises in the line of thoroughfare extending from Sumner Street to Southwark Bridge Road, and known by the names of Great Guildford Street and Little Guildford Street, in the respective Parishes of St. Saviour and St.-George-the-Martyr, Southwark, shall be re-numbered; that the name, Little Guildford Street, shall be abolished, and that the whole line of thoroughfare shall be called Great Guildford Street, S.E. Tho first-named order has been carried out by this Board; the second has been postponed on account of expected alterations in tho locality of Little Guildford Street. The object of tho change of name is to give Great Guildford (now Sumner) Street an outlet, as to its nomenclature, into one of the principal thoroughfares, in order to facilitate the description of its locality, and to enable strangers to find it more readily. Parliamentary Schemes. In November last, plans were deposited of tho London, Chatham and Dover Railway, City and Suburban Traffic Station, South London Tramways, and tho City of London and Metropolitan 5 Tramways. This Board petitioned against the London, Chatham and Dover Railway scheme, it having been thought that the right of way which the public possess through the Subway in Holland Street might be jeopardised thereby, but withdrew the petition on the Company undertaking to insert a clause in the Bill for preserving the right of way. The Board assented to both schemes for Tramways. Guy's Hospital In consequence of the flagrant mismanagement of this institution, and the disagreements which had arisen between the governors and the medical staff and nurses, this Board, in December last, petitioned Parliament for inquiry, by Royal Commission or otherwise, into the affairs and management of the Hospital. Delegates, Water Supply, &c. The Board has re-appointed Messrs. Hale and Rideajl to act as delegates on the question of Water Supply, and authorised them to support the following proposition: " That a water authority for "the Metropolis should be created, with statutory powers which "will enable such body to acquire and utilise, so far as may be "deemed expedient, existing sources of supply, and to have "recourse to such other sources of supply as upon investigation "may prove to be available and desirable." The Board also appointed Mr. Thorn and Mr. Stannah to act as its delegates at a conference which took place in March last, at the Kensington Yestry Hall, on various sanitary matters, and as members of a deputation appointed to wait upon the President of the Local Government Board in regard thereto. Price of Gas. The South Metropolitan Gas Company, the Company supplying the public lamps in the St. Saviour's district, have reduced, as from Christmas last, the price of Gas supplied per meter to the public lamps to 2s. 10d. per 1000 feet; and in respect of the lighting of the other lamps to £3 17s. per lamp per annum. The Company also allow an abatement of 5 per cent. on the amount charged for Gas, provided the amount be paid within one month from each quarter day when due. 6 Lighting by Electricity. This Board, in January last, consented to an application of the Anglo-American (Brush) Electric Light Corporation for permission to lay down wire cables from the Lambeth boundary, via Stamford Street and Blackfriars Road to Blackfriars Bridge, en route for the City. The cables having to be laid in close proximity to the pedestal lamp column at the west end of Southwark Street, it was thought to be a good opportunity for testing the power of the light in connection with such column. Accordingly, an arrangement has been made by which the Company supply one electric light, placed at the top of the column, the cost of which will be 6d. per hour. The Board is at the present time in communication with several other Electric Light Companies, with a view to lighting the principal thoroughfares by means of electricity. Obituary. By the death of Mr. Vousden, in April last, the Board lost the services of one of its oldest and most respected members; and in January last, Mr. John Errington, who had filled the office of Inspector of Nuisances from the first establishment of the Board in the year 1856, died. The Board has appointed Mr. Thomas Buckworth, formerly one of the Inspectors employed by the Town Council of Nottingham, as his successor. Precepts. Precepts have been issued for amounts required to meet the estimated local expenditure, the charges of the Metropolitan Board of Works, School Board for London, &c., as under, viz.:— LOCAL EXPENDITURE.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you to-day the twenty-fifth Annual Report of the Sanitary condition of the St. Saviour's District. During the past year there were causes of disease in operation from which, if they could have been foreseen, we should have predicted a probable increase of mortality. In large towns, and especially in such districts as this, the wear and tear of the physical frame demand a good deal of animal food. This, from the almost unprecedented price of meat, the poor have been unable to obtain. The commencement and the close of the year were marked by such a prevalence of dense fog that, during one week, twenty-six deaths were caused by diseases of the respiratory organs alone. It is satisfactory, therefore, that I am enabled to report a diminution of eighty-one deaths as compared with the year preceding. The registered number of deaths which occurred in Christchurch was 382, and in St. Saviour's 316, making a total of 698 deaths. The total number of births was 1,013, comprised in the following details:— Christchurch Males 242 Females 237 479 St. Saviour Males 266 Females 268 534 1,013 9 Eighty-two persons died in the Christchurch Workhouse, the greater number being aged and infirm men. Of the total number who died 56 were between 60 and 80 years, and 15 between 80 and 90 years. The following is a statement of all the deaths which occurred from various causes during the year:— DISEASES. CHRISTCHURCH. ST. SAVIOUR. Totals. Totals.

TOTAL 382 316 10 The deaths occurring under the head of zymotic diseases in the parish of Christchurch were: measles 5, whooping cough 10, typhoid fever 2, diarrhoea 6, scarlet fever 18, croup 3, syphilis 2, small-pox 1, rheumatism 1, erysipelas 1, pyœmia 1. And in the parish of St. Saviour, measles 6, whooping cough 11, typhoid fever 1, diarrhœa 14, scarlet fever 12, croup 1, erysipelas 1, puerperal fever 1, small-pox 5, and rheumatism 2. Thirty cases of small-pox and twelve of scarlet fever were removed to the Small-pox and Fever Hospitals at Stock well, Fulham, Deptford, and Homerton. All these cases were promptly removed when the nature of the disease was disclosed, and the houses and all bed-linen were thoroughly disinfected. In eight instances the beds and bed-linen were destroyed, and replaced at your expense. In Christchurch there were 13 deaths from violence, and in St. Saviour's 16. 22 inquests were held in Christchurch, and 25 in St. Saviour's. Twenty-seven bodies were conveyed to the Mortuary during the year. A large proportion were those who had been drowned in the River Thames. In November I was requested by the Sanitary Committee to report on the working of the Registration Act of 1874 relative to uncertified causes of death, which compulsorily enacts, in Section 20, as follows, and the subject is of sufficient interest to be mentioned in this Report:— " All registered practitioners shall furnish, for registration purposes, certificates setting forth the causes of the deaths of the patients they have attended during their last illness." 11 In point of fact, however, about twenty-five thousand deaths occur annually in England and Wales in cases where no registered practitioners have attended during the last illness, and no inquest is held. The duties of the Registrar are to enter the cause of death in a weekly list of deaths, with the name and qualifications of the medical practitioner. But, if an unqualified practitioner has been in attendance, then the Registrar must obtain from the friends of the deceased all information as to the supposed cause of death, which he must insert in the register. In all cases where any suspicious circumstances appear, it is the duty of the Registrar to lay the matter before the Coroner before registering the death. The late Registrar-General suggests that, in all cases of uncertified deaths, and deaths from causes suggesting suspicion or neglect, there should be a preliminary inquiry as to the supposed cause, to ensure the death being properly certified, or that a more thorough investigation may be made of the case in the form of an ordinary inquest afterwards. He further suggests that the local Medical Officer of Health should be appointed Medical Assessor to the Coroner. I think that the Registration Act should bo so amended as to enjoin upon Medical Officers of Health the duty of inquiry and certification in all cases of uncertified deaths. In the following statement I would direct your attention to the ages of those who died during the year. 12 PARISH OF CHRISTCHURCH—Population at Census, 1881, 13,656. Area in Statute Acres, 77.

Samples of the Water supplied by the Water Companies have been frequently analysed, and the examinations show that it has been of good quality. I have the satisfaction to report that the Lambeth Company have served notices on the owners and occupiers for a constant supply within the following area, viz.:— The London Road, from the Elephant and Castle northwards to St. George's Circus; thence along Westminster Bridge Road, as far as Waterloo Road, to the River Thames; the Thames eastward as far as Southwark Bridge Road; thence southwards along Southwark Bridge Road as far as Great Suffolk Street; both sides of Great Suffolk Street, and eastwards to Blackman Street and Newington Causeway. Gas Supply. I beg to report that the results of the examinations of Gas during the past year have been satisfactory. The average of all the observations gave an illuminating power equal to 16 sperm candles. The proportion of Ammonia has never reached the prescribed quantity of 2.5 grains for 100 cubic feet of Gas. Sulphuretted Hydrogen was never detected. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ROBERT BIANCHI. 25, Stamford Street, S.E. 1881. 17 PUBLIC ANALYST'S REPORT. TO THE ST. SAVIOUR'S DISTRICT BOARD OF WORKS. Gentlemen, During the past year I have examined 102 articles of food, many of them in duplicate, and in all cases where there was good reason to suspect adulteration. Of Milks, 44 samples have been taken. In the summer they wore of much better quality than in the quarter just passed. The admixture with water then rose from 7 to 22, and even 30 per cent. in two cases. I had hoped that such an amount of adulteration had come to an end; nevertheless we can, on the whole, congratulate ourselves on the great decrease since the working of this act by Mr. Bianchi and myself. Some of these milks were obtained in consequence of a slight adulteration amounting only to five per cent. of added water: the sending our Inspector for a further sample, after the lapse of a little time, generally raises the quality in a wonderful manner. As is nearly always the case with milks that have been tampered with, the addition of water occasions a more or less rapid falling off of the quantity of solids not fat, proving how impossible it is to fix upon any rule for deterioration. Inasmuch as the possibility of conveying disease by unboiled milk is a well-founded fact, it becomes of greater importance than ever that the character of the Condensed Milks should be well ascertained. Three such milks have been analysed, and the results generally bear out the character claimed for them. Only in one specimen did I find a falling off in the cream. 18 Butters are certainly not good, regarded in the light of productions from milk. Of 17 samples, more than one-half were not altogether genuine; 6 were spurious, and 3 partly so. Where the melting point is very high, the so-called butter consists of animal fat of the character of tallow and lard; where it is very low, we have butterine. One feature of the imitation butters is their comparative dryness; they contain little water, and are very free from taste. Instead of the 12 to 15 per cent, of water which we find in good butters, we have only from 5 to 6 per cent. No. 21, which was sold as butter, was almost tasteless. It was perfectly clean, and was unobjectionable as a mere fat for cooking purposes. Indeed it was superior to the genuine article, No. 35. One very usual feature of a spurious butter is the cleanness, which exhibits careful manipulation. I would sum up my experience of sham butters in the last quarter of the past year in the following words: dry, clean, tasteless and inodorous fats, perfectly wholesome if they can be relished, and a fair commercial article if sold cheaply as an imitation. Two Lards have been examined and approved. They have been tested both chemically and microscopically, and the results were quite satisfactory. Six Breads and three Flours next claim attention. At the present time the character of Bread is only second to that of milk. To what extent the nutritive quality of flour is reduced, by the removal of the husk and bran, we learn by comparing the three Flours which have been analysed. The percentage of nitrogen in English Super Whites amounted to l.32, or 1J parts per hundred of the flour. This is equal to 8.36 per cent, of gluten. The percentage of nitrogen in Hungarian Flour was equal to 1.14 parts; that of gluten to 7.21 parts per hundred. But in Whole Meal Flour the percentage of nitrogen was 1.7 parts per hundred, which is equal to 10.76 parts per hundred of gluten. Taken by themselves, these facts would be conclusive as to the greater value of the whole-meal flour for making bread. But we cannot thus easily decide. The coarseness of whole-meal flour creates a difficulty in making good bread. It is very retentive of water, and the resulting article 19 is often "sad" as the technical expression goes. In the sample of whole-meal bread analysed for this District Board the water amounted to 45 per cent., which is considerably above the average of wheaten bread. To make it tasty, it required a considerable addition of butter, so that much of the so-called economy was neutralized. Added to this, although the gluten amounted to per cent., the tendency of so much bran is to create a looseness, which removes it from the system before anything like the whole of its nutriment has been exhausted. Speaking, then, of bread made of whole-meal wheaten flour, it would seem to me that there is no waste whatever in removing the husk, as the latter amounts only to two per cent, of the grain, and is more suited to the stomachs of animals. Such brown bread is now made and sold under the name of decorticated bread. As to the bran, the large amount of nitrogen is admitted, but it does not follow that it is digested. If not digested, unless it is required as an aperient, brown bread is not so "staying;" in other words, does not so satisfy as white bread. The so-called granulated and decorticated brown bread is undoubtedly the best of the kind, as it is likely to be more digestible than whole-meal bread. As to the necessity which exists for cooking our food, and of employing the stomachs of animals to digest for us what we ourselves cannot do, nothing more striking can be mentioned than the weights of the stomachs, respectively, of man, pig, sheep, and ox, viz., 6 oz., 14 oz., 39 oz., and 51 oz. There is, therefore, no necessary waste if the coarser particles are removed and eaten by animals, and no unreason in separating the bran if it is found that such bread is too satisfying, in that it prevents our eating sufficient for our wants. It must be altogether a matter of experience. To many the brown bread is suitable, to others it is not. There is no use in dogmatizing. The bran, so rich in nitrogen, may be as little nutritious as the gristle and the skin which I remove from my meat, although the gristle and the skin are so rich in nitrogen. The well-to-do require no additional nitrogen; they already eat too much. With the poorer classes it is different. If brown bread is found agreeable, as well as digestible, it is more economical if sold at the same price as the white. The removal of the bran is perhaps more serious 20 as to the phosphates, and this applies especially to children; the phosphates can, however, be readily supplied in skim-milk, and it is a pity that so cheap an article is not more sought after. An Oatmeal of excellent quality reminds one of an article of great value to all. It is cheap, digestible, and very rich in nitrogen and phosphates. Malt Liquors, 6 in number, have been examined. Where the extractive is considerable, the ales and porters keep best, but of course everything depends upon the quality of the extractive. The keeping qualities vary so much. Some malt liquors become sour and mouldy in three days; others keep well for a week under precisely similar circumstances. Salt was uniformly present to the extent of, respectively, 35, 39, 42, and 46 grains per gallon. In all, the quantity was well kept under. In the case of a mild Burton Ale, only 152/3 grains were contained in the gallon. Where the chlorides are very high, either the water, or the inferior sugar used, is at fault. Five Spirits analysed showed that, with one exception, the percentage of alcohol was up to, and even beyond, the legal standards. The amount of alcohol in wines and spirits is of great importance, and there is far greater certainty in them as to the result to those who value them. There is naturally great evil in spirit drinking, but many people do not realize what an enormous and injurious amount of alcohol is taken in copious draughts of beer. Two samples of Cider, one on draught, the other bottled, were both very good of their kind. Neither of them contained a trace of metallic contamination, and both of them possessed a most pleasant odour of apples. Five per cent, of proof spirit rendered them agreeable and cooling; the bottled cider was the preferable, in that it was less sweet and less liable to acescence. A Lemonade was well aerated, sufficiently though feebly acidulated, but with the common defect of containing a trace of lead. Another non-alcoholic drink, very much thought of at the present time, answers to its description. It is a tonic, and very well aërated, containing as it does double its volume of carbonic acid. 21 It contains phosphorus in an oxidized form, and a not able quantity of iron. Speaking for myself, I should prefer a glass of Burton Ale, or, if I were a total abstainer, I should prefer water. But all these things are matters of taste. One Coffee, one Chicory, and one Cocoa were all that could be desired. But I confess, when I compare a genuine cocoa with some admixtures, I should be glad to be magisterially informed when cocoa ceases to be cocoa. What are we to say to cocoas containing only from 12 to 20 per cent, of cocoa? The Public is paying very dearly for the accommodation of admixing coarse sugar and flour! If it would accept advice, a slice of bread and butter, with a thin drink of genuine cocoa, would be both wholesomer and cheaper than when thickened and sweetened. But even if it should prefer such cocoas, at what point is the admixture to end? The name for Nos. 98 and 99 should be sugared flour and arrowroot, flavoured with cocoa. A sample of Honey, two kinds of Sweets, and a Bun complete the analyses for the twelvemonth. During the year that is past we have lost the services of our Inspector, Mr. Errington, by death. He had long been failing in health, but he did his best, as far as my office was concerned, in carrying out the Adulteration Act. All the certificates have been lodged either with the late Mr. Errington or with his successor, and I have further to thank our Medical Officer for the assistance he has rendered me. I remain, Gentlemen, Yours faithfully, ALBERT J. BEKNAYS. Chemical Laboratory, St. Thomas's Hospital June 21st, 1881. 22 SURVEYOR'S REPORT, From Lady-day, 1880, to Lady-day, 1881. ST.
