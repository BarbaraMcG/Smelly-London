Medical practitioners sent 1,064 notifications, midwives 1,171, maternity assistants 9, other persons 18, and parent 1. Further analysis shows that 1,332 notifications were sent by Paddington Hospital, 568 by St. Mary's Hospital, and 27 by Nursing Homes. A comparison of the Notification Register with the Returns supplied by the Registrars shows that of the 2,008 births registered during 1944, only six were not notified. * Corrected figures after allowing for inward and outward transfers. 4 Marriages.— The number of marriages solemnized in the Borough was 1,147, being a rate of 24.6 persons per 1,000 of the population.

Examinations. Positive Result. Diphtheria 163 9 Typhoid Fever 6 – Scarlet Fever 7 3 Dysentery 6 – Tuberculosis 93 3 275 15 Water Supply.— Paddington is supplied with water derived from the River Thames, which, after passing through storage reservoirs, is filtered and chlorinated at Barnes, and pumped from Hammersmith. The Metropolitan Water Board report that samples of the water being pumped into supply were taken at the works on five days each week, and examined both chemically and bacteriologically. Samples of the water during the various stages of purification are also examined at frequent intervals. The average results of analysis of the water being pumped into supply for the year 1944 are as follows:— Average Chemical Results for January to December, 1944. Parts per million. Ammoniacal Nitrogen 0.163 Albuminoid Nitrogen 0.083 Oxidised Nitrogen 3.1 Chlorides as Chlorine 30.6 Oxygen absorbed from Permanganate 3 hrs. at 80 deg.

Diphtheria Immunisation—Five hundred and eighty-two children were fully inoculated and 279 partly inoculated. Of the 582 fully inoculated cases, 60 were school children. At the end of the year it was estimated that 48.0% of the child population under 5 years of age, and 61.9% between the ages of 5 and 15 years, were immunised. Eleven children were immunised at the Clinic at St. .Mary's Hospital. Whooping Cough Inoculation.— During the year 261 children were completed inoculated, and at the end of the year there remained 160 cases where inoculation had not been completed. The total number of inoculations given was 1,268. Vaccination.— The latest return available is for the year 1943. This shows that of the 2,187 children whose births were registered during that year, 58.6% were successfully vaccinated, and 10.7% were exempted on production of statutory declarations. Insusceptibility, removals, not traced, etc., account for the remaining 30.7% Tuberculosis. Notification Register.— New cases comprised 233 of pulmonary tuberculosis and 26 of non-pulmonary tuberculosis. The number of cases on the register at the end of the year was 842, against 772 at the end of the previous year. The death rate for pulmonary tuberculosis was 0.82, the same as for the year 1943, and for all forms of tuberculosis the death rate was 0.90 (1943—0.87). Dispensary Treatment.—As from the 1st April the grant to St. Mary's Hospital was reduced by £300, and a part of the district served by the Tuberculosis Dispensary there was transferred to the Paddington Dispensary. On the 30th September the Dispensary at St. Mary's Hospital closed down entirely, and thereafter the whole of the Borough was served bv the Paddintrton Tuberculosis Dispensary, 14-18. Newton Road. Particulars of the work carried out are shown in the following tables:— Paddington T uberculosis Dispensary St. Mary's Hospital T uberculosis Dispensary (Up to 30th September) No. of patients examined for 1st time (excluding contacts) 783 79 No. of above found tuberculous 167 16 No. of contacts examined 93 33 No. of contacts found tuberculous 2 10 No. of attendances at Dispensary 5223 1377 No. of visits by Tuberculosis Officers 235 43 No. of visits by Tuberculosis Nurses 2927 503 No. of cases on Dispensary Register at end of year 774 – Tuberculosis Care Committee.—The Care Committee appointed by the Borough Council ceased to function on the outbreak of war, and has not been reconstituted, but in December, 1943, the Paddington Tuberculosis Dispensary formed a small Care Committee at the request of the Council. It is comprised of members of the Dispensary Committee and Staff, together with two members of the Borough Council. Miss Milner, the Secretary-Almoner of the Dispensary, has undertaken the Secretaryship. The Care Committee has a small Samaritan fund at its disposal, and during the year under review help was given in six cases. Other cases were referred to appropriate charitable organisations. Maintenance Allowances.—The scheme for payment of allowances to people who have to give up remunerative employment in order to undergo treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis was introduced as a war-time measure in July, 1943, and up to the end of 1944, 245 Paddington patients had applied for allowances, all of whom were certified by the Tuberculosis Officer as being medically eligible for the allowances. The scheme is the most important social measure yet taken in connection with the anti-tuberculosis campaign, but the general feeling throughout the country is that it should be extended to include patients suffering from any form of tuberculosis, and in any of its stages. In May, 1944, the Council requested the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee to make representations to the Minister of Health with this object in view. The Minister, in his reply, stated that he was unable to extend the scheme, and that any improved arrangements necessary for the treatment of tuberculosis generally must be dealt with as part of the National Health Service, and could not he anticipated by emergency arrangements made on account of war services. 6 Dental Treatment.— Twelve sessions were held at the Dispensary, at which there were 45 attendances. In one case the Council made a grant towards the cost of dentures required by a patient who could not afford them, and in respect of which a grant was not available from any other source. Extra Nourishment.—Ninety-three grants were made under the Council's Scheme. These are usually for a period of three months, or until admission to hospital or sanatorium. Before rationing came into force the standard grant was 1 pint of milk and 1 egg daily and half-pound butter weekly, but of these commodities, milk is now the only one available to tuberculous patients on priority grounds, and up to two pints a day may be allowed. Beds and Bedding.—In certain instances, where it is desirable that separate sleeping arrangements should be made, beds and bedding are supplied on loan by the Council. Three sets were supplied for this purpose during the year. Artificial Pneumothorax Refills.—During the year 1,013 refills were given at the Paddington Dispensary, and 116 at the St. Mary's Hospital Dispensary during the nine months it was open. In some instances, for clinical reasons or a patient's inability to attend the local dispensary, arrangements are made for refills to be given at outlying hospitals. During 1944,. 113 refills were so given to 10 patients at a standard charge of 10/6 per refill. Diabetes—In two cases insulin was supplied free of charge under the terms of Ministry of Health Circular No. 2734. This Circular gives general sanction for the provision of insulin to the poorer inhabitants of the district "until the termination of the present war." Mortuary.—The number of bodies deposited was '266. Medicinal Baths & Disinfecting Station.—Although the total number of persons who received treatment at the Medicinal Baths during 1944 was approximately the same as for the previous year, the number of verminous cases were more than double, i.e. 214 as against 99. This was due, in all probability, to the increase in the number of people using shelters during the latter part of the year. The number of persons who received treatment for scabies was 997 (217 males, 780 females), to whom 2,142 treatments were given. The amount of work now being carried out in connection with the treatment of verminous persons emphasises the need for a larger and more convenient establishment, and plans are in hand with this object in view. The approximate weight of bedding treated in the disinfecting station after infectious disease or vermin was 17½ tons. In addition about 4½ tons in use by the Civil Defence Services passed through the Disinfector. The number of rooms disinfected after the occurrence of infectious disease was 276, and 210 library books were dealt with. Cleansing of Verminous Rooms.—On the 27th January, 1944, the Council decided to institute a Fumigation Service, but owing to the difficulty in obtaining suitable labour the scheme did not start until the middle of July, when two men (ex-Civil Defence Wardens) were engaged. When not fully employed on these duties, as is the case during the colder months, their services are utilised in connection with rat repression, the necessary financial adjustment being made. The charges fixed by the Council are: £1 for a room not exceeding 1,000 cubic feet, plus 4/6 for each additional 1,000 cubic feet or part thereof. Up to the end of the year 122 rooms had been dealt with in addition to several Civil Defence premises. The charges amounted to £181, the cost of the labour and materials involved being approximately £173. The method of fumigation used renders it unnecessary, except in rare instances, for wallpaper or woodwork to be removed, and the results have been very satisfactory, a further complaint of bug infestation having been received in only one instance. The process has also been used successfully against cockroaches. Rent & Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts.—Only one application was received, and a certificate was issued. Factories Act, 1937.—Visits numbered 280. Infringements of the Act discovered were remedied without recourse to the service of notices. Bakehouses.—Inspections numbered 172. At the end of the year the number of level bakehouses was 14 and basement bakehouses 25, being one basement bakehouse less than the previous year. Shops Acts Inspections of all kinds numbered 476. No exemption certificates were applied for, and no legal proceedings were necessary. 7 Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933.—At the end of the year the Register contained 80 entries, the same number as for the previous year. Inspections numbered 476. Work of the District Inspectors.— Five Inspectors were engaged throughout the year on district work. The number of complaints of all kinds dealt with was 1,812, against 1,550 for 1943. Inspections numbered 12,694. Legal proceedings were instituted in 21 cases for offences under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, or for contraventions of the Byelaws. Work of the Women Sanitary inspectors.—Visits in connection with infectious disease numbered 4,135. This is exclusive of tuberculosis visiting, which is now done entirely by the staff of the Paddington Tuberculosis Dispensary, 1,486 miscellaneous visits were also recorded, which include visits to schools, aged persons, and the common lodging house for women at 179, Harrow Road. One of the women sanitary inspectors is also engaged in supervisory work at the medicinal baths. Food Supervision. Sampling.—Five hundred samples were taken for analysis, and of these, 3 informal samples were found to be adulterated (0.6%). One hundred and sixty-six of these samples were of milk, and only one (0.6%) was found to be not genuine. Legal proceedings were taken in one instance in respect of the sale of scones which were unfit for human consumption. The summons was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act, five guineas costs being awarded to the Council. Unsound Food.—The weight of diseased and unsound food surrendered by tradesmen and dealers for destruction was approximately 16½ tons, and just over four tons were rendered unfit for consumption on account of enemy action. Slaughtering.—No slaughtering takes place in the Borough now, but three slaughtermen's licences issued by the Council are in force. The issue of a licence by any particular authority enables a slaughterman to perform his work in any district. Inspections.—During the year 502 inspections were made of the premises from which milk is sold or distributed, and 4,488 inspections of other food premises. At the end of the year the register showed that there were in the Borough 59 Dairies, 57 Purveyors of Milk, and 855 other Food Premises. Milk (Special) Designations Orders.—Licences issued were as follows :— Principal licences. Supplementary licences "Pasteurised" Milk 44 3 "Tuberculin Tested" Milk 14 3 58 6 Six samples of "Pasteurised" milk were taken and these all complied with the prescribed conditions. There are no Pasteurising plants in the Borough, neither is there any bottling of "Tuberculin Tested" milk. Rats & Mice.—One hundred and ninety-one complaints of rats were received during 1944 (against 250 for the previous year) and were dealt with by the District Sanitary Inspectors. Where necessary, examinations were made by the Borough Engineer and Surveyor of the sewer connections of houses affected, and also of adjoining premises, any defects found being made good. Mr. Harrison, Food Inspector and Rodent Officer for the Borough, reports that during the year 1944, only a minor secondary degree of rat infestation was found in the food and other premises situated in the Borough of Paddington. This condition also applied in the case of mice. Where infestations were found, the usual method of prebaiting followed by poison baiting was employed. Trapping was also resorted to in certain cases. During the year and in accordance with a Direction served on the Council by the Ministry of Food, the sewers were given two maintenance treatments for the elimination of rats. The first treatment took place in January, when 559 entrances to the sewers were dealt with and the estimated kill was 2,273 rats. The second treatment occured in December, when 394 entrances were treated and the estimated kill was 2,325. Altogether three treatments have now been given and the estimated number of rats killed is 9,353. The executive part of this work was carried out by the Sewers Section of the Borough Engineer's Department; the materials for baiting were provided by this Department, whilst Mr. Harrison superintended the mixing of the baits and acted throughout in an advisory capacity. 8 During 1944, a special survey of the Kensal Road area was made in conjunction with a similar one by Kensington. Other parts of the Borough were also surveyed and altogether 1,414 premises (mostly dwelling houses) were inspected, but in only 24 cases was there found to be any infestation of rats, and these only of a minor degree. • Housing.—Of persons living in premises the subject of clearance or closing orders made prior to the year under review, 10 secured accommodation of a private nature through their own efforts, and three were rehoused on London County Council Estates. Of the 115 cases of overcrowding on the Register at the end of 1943 :— 13 were found to be abated by removal, and a further 2 by a natural reduction in the size of the family, or on obtaining additional accommodation ; 47 were found to be temporarily abated in consequence of members of the family having been evacuated or serving with H.M. Forces ; 44 were still overcrowded ; and 9 could not be investigated as no one could be found to answer inquiries. 17 new cases of overcrowding were discovered during the year, of which three were abated by removal. Four overcrowded families were provided with accommodation on London County Council Estates, and two other families were rehoused by the County Council on medical grounds. At the Marylebone Police Court on the 30th May, 1944, convictions were obtained against the occupier and the landlord of the dwelling-house, two first floor rooms at 61, Cirencester Street, for causing or permitting the rooms to become overcrowded. The Magistrate imposed fines of £5 on the occupier and £2 10s. Od. on the landlord, and ordered each to pay one guinea costs. During the year Associated Fumigators, Limited, under an agreement with the Council, removed and treated the furniture, etc., of one family with hydrogen cyanide gas. The cost of the work was £3 5s. Od. Maternity & Child Welfare.—Miss M. MacLean and Miss E. M. Candler. Health Visitors, continued to be seconded to War-time Services and to the Rehousing Department, respectively, and to meet the need for the services of midwives in Emergency Maternity Homes during the further evacuation which took place during the year, Miss B. E. Bates was seconded for duty under arrangements with the Ministry of Health from the 24th July to the 7th October. The staff engaged on health visiting at the end of the year numbered 14 (including the Superintendent and 6 temporary health visitors). Home Visiting : First visits to children under 1 year 1,561 Revisits 9,551 11,112 Visits to children ages 1-5 years 10,593 First visits to expectant mothers 1,037 Revisits 2,171 3,208 Other Visits: Sickness (including Puerperal Fever, Puerperal Pyrexia, Ophthalmia Neonatorum and Infantile Diarrhoea) 337 Miscellaneous (including ineffective calls) 5,679 6,016 The number of children on the Health Visitors' lists at the close of the year was 5,513. Infant Consultations: 354 sessions, 18,939 attendances by 2,043 children. Ante- and Post-Natal Clinics: 99 sessions, 2,230 attendances by 648 expectant or recently confined mothers. Dental Treatment: 71 nursing or expectant mothers received treatment under arrangements made with Mr. F. H. Brinkley Tofts, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.). Home Helps : Provided in 97 cases. 9 Maternity Beds: 89 women were delivered in the beds reserved at St. Mary's Hospital. No case of puerperal infection was notified. There were three stillbirths and no deaths within 10 days of birth. Extra Nourishment: The Council's scheme has been amended by the substitution of the scale applicable to the National Milk Scheme for that hitherto used. 72 new applications were received, of which 69 were granted. Approximate expenditure, including ancillary foods, medicines, etc., £73 10s. 0d. Convalescence: Two mothers were sent to convalescent homes, and 2 children were sent away under arrangements with the Invalid Children's Aid Association. Child Life Protection: 273 visits and inspections were made. At the close of the year the Register contained the names of 17 persons, who had charge of 24 children. No legal proceedings were necessary. The Council's scheme of guaranteed payments to foster mothers was utilised in one instance. Daily Guardians: 14 persons were registered for the care of 19 children. At the end of the year the Register contained the names of 45 Guardians who had charge of 56 children. Perambulator Scheme : Full advantage continued to be taken of these facilities, the number of perambulators available for hire being 76 (including 3 twin perambulators). Care of Illegitimate Children: Following the issue of Ministry of Health Circular 2866 (Revised), this subject received the careful consideration of the Council and the resulting proposals were submitted to the Ministry. These include the existing scheme of guaranteed payments to Foster Mothers, with an increase in the weekly rates payable to 17s. 6d. for children not exceeding one year of age and 15s. Od. for children from 1 year to 5 years ; the provision of a hostel for women in the late stages of pregnancy and immediately after confinement, and the subsequent care of mother and infant; financial assistance to voluntary welfare organisations on a basis of rateable value as suggested by the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee; and the welfare generally of unmarried mothers. With regard to the Minister's suggestion for the appointment of a special Welfare Worker, it was thought desirable that for a period of twelve months the Council's Health Visitors should undertake this work in their respective districts under the supervision and direction of the Superintendent Health Visitor. These proposals have received the Minister of Health's approval. Financial assistance towards the maintenance of one case in the Main Memorial Home was given during the year. Care of Premature Infants: This subject was receiving the attention of a special Sub-Committee prior to the issue of Ministry of Health Circular 20/44 and steps had already been taken to implement certain of the suggestions contained therein. The suggestion as to information on the notification of birth cards where the weight at birth is 5½ lbs. or less has been acted upon. The special equipment referred to in the circular has been made available on loan and the Council's Home Help Service has been augmented. Arrangements have been made for the provision of expressed breast milk where necessary, and the services of Dr. Reginald Lightwood and Dr. C. T. Potter are available in cases where paediatric advice is required and the parents are not in a position to pay for such advice privately. Special accommodation for two premature infants has been provided at St. Mary's Hospital and suitable accommodation can also be obtained at Paddington Hospital. War-time Day Nuseries : Marylands Road Nursery was opened on the 15th March, 1944. Details of the nurseries in operation at the end of the year are given below:— 0—2 years.

Accommodation is also provided at the Queen's Park Day Nursery, 66, Lancefield Street, for 26 children between the ages of 2 and 5 years, although not formally approved by the Minister of Health as a War-time Day Nursery. Owing to increased enemy aerial activity and the lack of shelter accommodation, this nursery was closed from the 28th August to the 5th November, the children being transferred to other nurseries. 10 Details of attendances are given in the following table:— Days open.

Consideration was therefore given to the desirability and need for completion, bearing in mind the state of the War, and a suggestion for utilising the site for temporary housing purposes, and it was decided that, having regard to the scarcity of labour for this type of work and other factors, the need would have disappeared by the time the nursery was likely to be completed. It was consequently decided to take no further steps in the matter. There are two nursery schools in the Borough, provided by the London County Council, viz., at Senior Street School and at Beauchamp Lodge, Warwick Crescent.
