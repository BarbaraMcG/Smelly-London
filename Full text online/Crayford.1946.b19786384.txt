Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my 25th and last Annual Report. Of the 'old contemptibles' only Mr. Lyle as Councillor and Mr. Goodman as Accountant remain., We together have seen many changes in the comparatively short time of 25 years. Diphtheria. In looking back over the period the most striking change is in the incidence of Diphtheria. In 1921 the first year of these reports it was my unfortunate lot to have to report 111 cases with 12 deaths. No cases have occurred since 1942. Making the widest allowance for any other factors—i.e., housing, general improvement in hygiene it is impossible to resist the conclusion that this improvement is due to the widespread adoption of immunisation. We have always had high figures and last year the percentages were, under five years 81 per cent., and 5—15 years 94 per cent. Housing. By 1938, overcrowding, according to the admittedly low standards of the 1936 Act, had been reduced to 24 cases. The war period of course played havoc with these figures. 184 houses were totally demolished and 568 seriously damaged. The Council are proceeding vigourously with their programme so as to get back as quickly as possible to at least the pre-war standard. 3 Maternity and Child Welfare. Deep interest in this work as been a feature from the beginning and we have been fortunate in having two such excellent Health Visitors as Miss Kiddell and Miss Smith. The competence of the work is reflected in the death rate figures of infant mortality—consistently well below the figures for England and Wales and reaching the low record of 23 in 1945. I must take the opportunity of thanking all Councillors and fellow officials, especially those of longer standing, for all the consideration and help given during my term of office. In such a field as Public Health where the dictate of medicine is conditioned by what is allowed by Law— sound legal advice is a 'cine qua non' and I have to thank Mr. Hodgson especially for his guidance and help. In my own department without being invidious I feel I should especially mention Mr. Milligan and Mrs. Mitchell, whose period of office covers a large part of that of my own. I am, Your obedient servant, C. M. OCKWELL, Medical Officer of Health. 4 STATISTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA.

Under terms of Ministry of Health Circular 221/45 and Ministry of Education Circular 75, the Shenstone Nursery (capacity 60 children) was taken over by the Council from 1st April, 1946. The Slade Green Nursery (capacity 40 children) was closed on the 31st March, 1946, as there were only about 18 attending. Arrangements were made to transport the children to Shenstone daily. The Council's decision to retain the Crawford Nursery has proved popular. In October the attendance reachcd their peak and there was a waiting list. Number of attendances :— Crayford 10,612.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA. Water. The Metropolitan Water Board is the supplying Authority and I am indebted to the Director of Water Examination for the following information. The supply to the Crayford District is a mixture of water from Wilmington, Darenth, Wansunt, Crayford, and Bexley Wells. All the water is chlorinated as it leaves the works. Bacteriological analyses are made five times per week and consistently satisfactory results have been obtained. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being restored to use, and samples of water are tested bacteriologically. None of the supplies is plumbo-solvent. 23 All supplies are direct and not by means of stand- pipes. Extension of mains have been made to serve housing sites at Thames Road and Martens Avenue. Drainage and Severage. Extensions of foul surface water sewers have been made to serve the housing site at Thames Road. Rivers and Streams. The normal maintenance was carried out on the main marsh dykes and main rivers during 1946 in the Crayford district. Weed growth was far in excess of the usual amount. The banks of Crayford Creek were faggotted to prevent erosion. Closet Accommodation. Approximate number of premises containing each type of sanitary convenience in the district :— W.C's. into drainage system 8030 W.C's. into Cesspools 7 Earth Closets or privy middens 4 Pail Closets 9 Number of premises not connected to public water supplies 2 Public Cleansing.
