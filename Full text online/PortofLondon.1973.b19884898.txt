PLON81 CORPORATION OF LONDON PORT HEALTH AUTHORITY ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH TO 31st DECEMBER, 1973 To be presented Thursday, 25th July 1974 CONSTITUTION AND JURISDICTION The governing body of the City of London, the Corporation of London, was originally constituted the Sanitary Authority of the Port of London by Section 20 of the Public Health Act, 1872. The cost of administration was met from the Corporation's private funds for close on fifty years, when it became rate (and grant) aided. By the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the term "Port Sanitary" was changed to "Port Health", and the Port Health district is further defined by the Act as the "Port of London as established for the purposes of the law relating to the Customs of the United Kingdom" and by the Public Health Act, 1936 as "the Port as established for the purposes of the enactments relating to the Customs". The Public Health (London) Act 1936 was repealed by the London Government Act 1963 but Section 89 (1) of that Act defined the Port of London as "the Port of that name established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise." In accordance with the provisions of the London Port Health Authority Order 1965 made under Section 41 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the Corporation of London shall have jurisdiction as Port Health Authority - (a) as respects functions, rights and liabilities of a local authority under the enactments mentioned in Part I of Schedule I of the Order over all waters within the Port and over such part of the district of any riparian authority as comprises the whole of any wharf and of the area within the gates of any dock and the buildings thereon respectively, forming part of or abutting upon the Port; (b) as respects any other functions, rights and liabilities assigned to them, within the Port (The Port of London established for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise). The limits of the Port of London for the purposes of the enactments relating to customs or excise were originally defined by a Treasury Minute dated 1st August, 1883. They commence at high water mark in the River Thames at Teddington Lock, in the County of Surrey, and extend down both sides of the said River Thames to an imaginary straight line drawn from the Pilot mark at the entrance of Havengore Creek in the County of Essex, to the land's end at Warden Point, in the Isle of Sheppey, in the County of Kent, such point being the north-western limit of the Port of Faversham, and extend up and include both sides of the River Medway to an imaginary straight line drawn from the south-east point of land westward of Coalmouth Creek, thence across the said River Medway to the western-most point of the piece of land which forms the eastern side of Stangate Creek, or, in other words, the north-west point of Fleet Marsh and thence in a southerly direction to Iwade Church in the said County of Kent, and thence in a north-easterly direction to Elmley Chapel in the said Isle of Sheppey, a supposed direct line from Elmley Chapel to Iwade Church, being the western limit of the Port of Faversham, and the said Port of London includes the Islands of Havengore Creek aforesaid, called Potton and Rushley Islands, and so much of the said Creek and Watercourses as extends from it to the town of Rochford, and also includes all other Islands, Rivers, Streams, Creeks, Waters, Watercourses, Channels, Harbours, Docks and places within the before-mentioned limits contained. Following upon the extension of the area of jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority by the Port of London Authority (Extension of Seaward Limit) Act 1964 the area of jurisdiction of the Corporation of London as Port Health Authority was similarly amended by Section 31 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1965 which added at the end of the definition of "Port of London" in Section 89 (1) of the London Government Act 1963 the following words: "together with all such waters between the seaward limit of the Port as so established and imaginary straight lines drawn from latitude 51° 37' 00" north, longitude 00° 57' 19" east (Foulness Point in the County of Essex) to latitude 51° 46' 05" north, longitude 01° 20' 32" east (GunfleetOld Lighthouse) and thence to latitude 51 0 26' 36" north, longitude 01° 25' 30" east and thence to latitude 51° 24' 55" north, longitude 00° 54' 21" east (Warden Point in the County of Kent) as are for the time being within the territorial waters of Her Majesty's dominions." The Port of London Authority with which the Port Health Authority works in close cooperation was established as the administrative body of the Port of London including the docks and tideway of the River Thames, by Act of Parliament in 1909.

Joseph John Packard David Manuel Shalit 2 To:- THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COMMONS OF THE CITY OF LONDON IN COMMON COUNCIL ASSEMBLED My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour, as Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London, to submit my Annual Report for the year ending 31st December, 1973. There were several developments within the Port during the year which will be of interest to you. In June the U.S.S.R. passenger ship "Mikhail Lermontor" which has a capacity to carry 670 passengers, inaugurated a regular passenger service between Leningrad, Bremerhaven, Le Havre, London (Tilbury) and New York. This was additional to their Leningrad to Montreal service via Tilbury. The Polish Ocean Lines passenger ship "Stefan Batory" continued to operate the regular passenger service from Tilbury to Montreal. Holiday cruises to Russia, the Baltic, Scandinavia, West Indies, Canary Islands and the Mediterranean were made from Tilbury. Several cruise ships called at Tilbury, for London, as part of their cruise itinerary. During the year,of the 65 passenger vessels which berthed at Tilbury Landing Stage, 51 ships were owned by the U.S.S.R. Modernisation of two sheds in the Royal Albert Dock was commenced late in the year to deal with the re-established trade, including food-stuffs, from the Peoples Republic of China. During the year, members of the Port and City of London Health Committee visited the following areas of the Port Health District: — The refuse handling depot at Cringle Street, Battersea; the Surrey and West India Docks; the London Marina in the Royal Docks; Tilbury Dock and the Annual River Inspection from the Tower of London to Gravesend. The City of London Fishing Experiment was inaugurated in June. The Experiment,which is to be held annually, will take place in Gravesend Reach for the purpose of obtaining as many varieties of fish as possible within a set period of fishing time. Teams representing angling clubs from the London area are invited to participate and the Thames Angling Preservation Society, which was founded in 1838, assists and advises the Department in conducting the fishing exercise. Sir Edward Howard, Bt., C.B.E., D.Sc., has kindly donated a trophy to be known as the Lady Howard Cup to be held by the winning team. The object of the experiment is to demonstrate that the River Thames is becoming cleaner and less polluted and thereby encourage the general public to participate in the prevention of the pollution of the environment and in particular the River Thames. I wish to express my appreciation of the invaluable assistance which has been given by the numerous individuals and organisations whose work is so closely allied with ours in the Port. The co-operation which is displayed is of the utmost importance in carrying out the multitude of operations in which we are involved. As I retire from the office of Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London at the end of August, 1974, this is the last Annual Report for the London Port Health Authority that I shall have the honour to submit. I should like, therefore, to say how grateful I am to all those who have contributed to the work of the Department during my term of office, and in particular to the Chairman and Members of the Port and City of London Health Committee, as well as the Staff of the Department whose assistance and loyalty I greatly valued. I have the honour to be, My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant W.G. SWANN, M.D., B.Sc., Medical Officer of Health, Port and City of London. 3 SECTION I - STAFF (As at 31st December, 1973) TABLE A Name of Officer Nature of Appointment Commenced Service Any Other Appointment held MEDICAL STAFF W.G.

The Port of London trades with all parts of the world. SECTION IV INLAND BARGE TRAFFIC Numbers and tonnage using the district and places served by the traffic The trend of the last few years, which has seen a contraction of the lighterage industry on the River Thames, continued during the year. The Port of London Authority registered a total of 2,081 lighters, with an aggregate tonnage of some 249,504 tons, during the year. These lighters, by way of creeks and canals, operate throughout the Port and its environs. They include general purpose cargo carriers and craft which are specially designed for the carriage of bulk liquid and refrigerated cargoes. Some of the lighters used for carrying refrigerated cargo are fitted with refrigeration plant and the bulk liquid carriers have steam heating coils incorporated in their tanks. Control of the carriage of food in lighters, barges and other vessels is provided for by the Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, etc.) Regulations 1960. A watch is kept on lighters used for the carriage of foodstuffs, so as to eliminate, as far as possible, any contamination of food during its transport in these craft. During the year 121 general cargo lighters and 13 refrigerated lighters were inspected for cleanliness of the holds prior to loading food cargoes. 7 SECTION V WATER SUPPLY (1) Source of supply for (a) the district No change (b) shipping No change (2) Reports of tests for examination No change (3) Precautions taken against contamination and hosepipes No change (4) Number and sanitary condition of water boats, and powers of control by the Authority No change There were nine reports of contamination from hydrants during the year, six reports of contamination from standpipes and seventeen reports of contamination from the ends of delivery hoses supplying fresh water to ships. The contamination from watering points was discovered during the normal course of routine sampling and indicates the necessity to continue routine bacteriological sampling of the water supplies in the District. No single attributable cause for the contamination was discovered after investigation and it must be assumed that the contamination had been introduced through unhygienic handling of the watering equipment. No ships received "unfit" water. There were fifty-one reports of contamination in the distribution supply system on board ships. Samples were drawn mainly from fresh water taps over galley and messroom sinks. The source of supply from these taps is from the "domestic fresh water" storage contained in double bottom tanks and peak tanks. The presence of this potential danger on board stresses the necessity of ensuring that the standard of purity of "domestic" water supplies should be as high as the "potable" water supplies. Three samples were drawn directly from ships storage tanks, two of which were found to be contaminated. One sample of fresh water was drawn from the delivery hose end on board a barge purveying fresh water to the District. The sample showed contamination and the standard procedure of chlorination was carried out. Due regard is paid to the co-operation this Authority has received from other United Kingdom and Continental Ports through the interchange of adverse fresh water sampling reports in respect of those ships where some degree of contamination of the fresh water on board was discovered subsequent to departure for another United Kingdom or Continental Port. This interchange of information enables follow-up visits to be made by the Port Health Authorities concerned and enables remedial measures to be taken before the ship sails. Routine sampling of water supplies, as practised in previous years, was discontinued during the second quarter of 1973 at the request of the laboratory which had staff difficulties and an interruption in the supplies of media materials. Sampling of any suspicious water, however, continued to be dealt with by the laboratory. This curtailment of the normal sampling routine reduced the total number of samples drawn during the year and to some extent has adversely affected the "wholesome" percentage figure of 79.36, shown in Table 2, when compared to the percentage figure obtained in previous years. The number of "unsatisfactory" and "suspicious" samples shows the importance of verifying the purity of fresh water supplies to shipping.

List of Infected Areas (Regulation 6) — Arrangements for the preparation and amendments of the list, the form of list, the persons to whom it is supplied and the procedure for supplying it to those persons. No change. 2. Radio Messages (a) The London Port Health Authority is formally designated, by the Department of Health and Social Security, for the receipt and transmission of radio messages to and from ships prior to their arrival in the District, under Regulation 12 of the Public Health (Ships) Regulations 1970. This is of particular importance, in view of the movement down river of the "centre of gravity" of the Port. More and more ships, including nearly all tankers, are berthing below Gravesend, and it is necessary that the Boarding Medical Officer on watch should be able to question the Master directly in order to determine what action should be taken to clear the ship. Furthermore, at the request of H.M. Customs, the Port Health Authority has, since 1st February, 1973, been carrying out health clearance procedures for all ships entering the Port from foreign ports. This has necessitated the use of International Channel 6 for questioning ships' masters, while a listening watch is maintained on International Channel 12, in order that the duty Medical Officer can be aware of routine ship to shore messages. These are often useful in providing early warning of a ship's arrival and sometimes of importance in that a ship with epidemiological problems may be recognised before the official quarantine radio message is received. (b) Arrangementsforsendingpermission by radio forships to enter the district (Regulation 13). No change. (c) Arrangements for receiving messages by radio from ships and for acting thereon (Regulation 14(1)(a) and (2)). No change. 3. Notification Otherwise Than by Radio (Regulation 14(1 )(b)). Arrangements for receiving notifications otherwise than by radio and acting thereon:- No change. 4. Mooring Stations (Regulations 22 to 30) Situation of stations and any standing directions issued under these Regulations:- No change. 5. Arrangements For — (a) Hospital accommodation for infectious diseases (other than Smallpox — see Section VII). Since Denton Hospital became inoperative in July, 1973, all infectious cases are sent direct to Joyce Green Hospital. (b) Surveillance and follow up of contacts. No change.

VERY LARGE CRUDE CARRIERS (V.L.C.C.'s) The arrival of V.L.C.C.'s at Shellhaven and Coryton has now been established as a regular feature of the Port of London. But for the world oil situation the arrival figures for 1973 would have shown a further increase. Over the last three months several shipments of crude oil were either cancelled or diverted elsewhere. The high standard in the crew's living conditions and the overall cleanliness aboard these vessels has continued. Health clearance procedure has continued as in the previous year without any apparent difficulty and liaison with H.M. Customs has been satisfactory. 10 Summary of Movements 1973 (1972 in brackets) (a) V.L.C.C.'s arriving from prescribed lightening areas 11 (19) (b) V.L.C.C.'s arriving from continental ports after lightening 59 (53) (c) Health declarations received via the lightening vessel when V.L.C.C. has proceeded elsewhere 21 (12) LIGHTER ABOARD SHIP DEVELOPMENTS "LASH" and "SEABEE" systems The 'LASH' service from the Gulf of Mexico to Sheerness continued throughout 1973, with the four vessels employed in this service making a total of thirty-eight voyages. Some 606 lighters were discharged, of which 503 proceeded to wharves within the Authority's district for off loading. As in previous years the major portion of the cargo imported by this system consisted of forestry products and chemicals although there has been a slight increase in the amount of foodstuffs being shipped by this method. The foodstuffs consist mainly of rice in bulk, canned food for human consumption and dried egg products, the examination of which is carried out by your Port Health Inspectors at their place of discharge. The 'SEABEE' service, inaugurated last year, has been maintained during 1973. In the early part of the year a third vessel, the "TILLIE LYKES" joined the other two vessels already engaged on this service. In all a total of twenty-four voyages were made from the Gulf of Mexico to Gravesend, with some 237 units being discharged. The bulk of the imports consisted of forestry products, chemicals and general cargo. As in the previous year, all the units were towed to the Victoria Deep Water Terminal, Greenwich for discharge. MEDICAL INSPECTIONS AT GRAVESEND The effect of the change in procedure providing for clearance of all ships by the Medical Officer on watch, as detailed in Section Vl(2) of this report, is very evident R/T Clearance is given only when it has been ascertained that all is well on board.

Name of Isolation Hospital to which smallpox cases are sent from the District. Long Reach Hospital is situated on the south bank of the River Thames about eight miles above Gravesend. The hospital consists of 10 ward blocks capable of accommodating 170 patients but, except in cases of emergency, only three ward blocks (2 of 20 beds and 1, a cubicle ward, of 10 beds, total 50 beds) are kept available for immediate use. The hospital includes residential quarters for the staff and laundry, although the administration and staffing is carried out from Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. 11 2. Arrangements for transport of such cases to that Hospital by ambulance giving the name of the Authority responsible for the ambulance and the vaccinal state of the ambulance crew. A case or cases of smallpox would be removed from the vessel by one of this Authority's ambulance-launches and conveyed ashore via the pontoon at Denton and from thence conveyed by road ambulance direct to Long Reach Hospital. The Port Health Authority would be responsible for the vaccinal state of their ambulancelaunch crews, while the vaccinal state of the Road Ambulance personnel would be the concern of the ambulance authority, the Greater London Council. 3.

Huisman, Medical Officer for the Port of Rotterdam, stating that nine members of a crew had been taken ill whilst their vessel was in Rotterdam. All nine had suffered from vomiting and abdominal cramps. Eating baked liver was suspected to be the cause of the outbreak of sickness. The remaining liver and also certain pathological specimens had been sent for bacteriological analysis and Dr.Huisman indicated that the result of the analysis would betelexed to the Port Health Authority as soon as it was known. The vessel arrived at the Royal Group of Docks on the 30th January. One of the Port Health Inspectors boarded the vessel and interviewed the Master, who reported that the nine members of the crew who were sick had recovered and that there was no sickness then on board. A check was, however, kept on the crew until the vessel sailed. No further sickness was reported. Information was received by telex from Dr. Huisman reporting that the results of the bacteriological examinations had proved negative. This information was passed on to the Master of the vessel before she sailed. Dr. Huisman had also passed the information to the Port Authorities at Le Havre, the next port of call after London. Suspected Food Poisoning (2) A vessel arrived in the Port of London on 19th February, from West Africa when it was reported to the Duty Boarding Medical Officer that fifteen crewmembers had suffered from sickness and diarrhoea during the voyage. The Boarding Medical Officer examined 3 members of the crew and was satisfied that they and the other members who had been ill had recovered. An investigation was conducted as to the possible source of infection and samples of drinking water, food and faecal specimens were sent for laboratory examination, the results of which were negative. In addition a detailed inspection was made of the catering spaces and accommodation and although the standard of hygiene was generally satisfactory, a number of defects were found and reported to the Catering Superintendent for immediate attention. The crew were kept under surveillance throughout their stay in London and no further cases of sickness were reported. Suspected Typhoid A vessel arrived in the Port of London on the 18th August, via Southampton, and it was reported to the Duty Boarding Medical Officer by the ship's agents that there was a possible typhoid contact on board. It was ascertained from the Deputy Medical Officer of Health for Southampton, who had boarded the vessel, that the contact was the ship's Assistant Steward. The steward had flown back to this country after leaving another vessel at Ras Tanura, to join the vessel in question. Two members of the crew of this other vessel had been taken ill after he had left. They were seen by the Port Medical Authorities in the Cocos Islands, who diagnosed possible Typhoid. The Duty Boarding Medical Officer boarded the vessel and was informed by the steward that he had been well since leaving the other vessel, 14 days previously. However a stool specimen was taken, the result of which proved to be negative. There was no illness among other crew members. The Deputy Medical Officer of Health for Southampton was informed of the result, as the vessel was returning to that Port. Pulmonary Tuberculosis A vessel arrived in Tilbury Dock on the 20th November from Hull. When boarded by one of the Port Health Inspectors it was ascertained that one of the crew had been found to be suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis and had been removed from the vessel whilst at Hull. A mobile X-Ray unit had attended the vessel in Hull and most of the crew had been X-rayed. The Port Health Authority at Hull had carried out the disinfection of the cabin, bedding etc. It was found that three members of the crew had not been X-rayed in Hull and arrangements were made for them to be X-rayed whilst the vessel was in Tilbury Dock. Information has since been received indicating that the results from the X-ray examinations were satisfactory. 15 SECTION X OBSERVATIONS OF THE OCCURRENCE OF MALARIA IN SHIPS Two cases of Malaria (seamen) were reported during the year under review. This compares with one case in 1972. A Notice giving suggestions for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of Malaria is issued by the Department of Trade and Industry and should be on board every British ship. SECTION XI MEASURES TAKEN AGAINST SHIPS INFECTED OR SUSPECTED FOR PLAGUE No ships infected with plague arrived during the year. The Fourth Schedule to the Public Health (Ships) Regulations, 1970, reads as follows: — Regulation 33 "SCHEDULE 4 ADDITIONAL MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE DISEASES SUBJECT TO THE INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS PART I - PLAGUE A. Infected ships and suspected ships (1) The Medical Officer may — (a) require any suspect on board to be disinsected and may place him under surveillance, the period of surveillance being reckoned from the date of arrival of the ship; (b) require the disinsecting and, if necessary, disinfection of the baggage of any infected person or suspect, and of any other article on board and any part of the ship which the Medical Officer considers to be contaminated. (2) If there is any rodent infected with plague on board the Medical Officer or other authorised officer shall require the ship to be deratted in a manner to be determined by him, but without prejudice to the generality of this requirement the following special provisions shall apply to any such deratting:- (a) the deratting shall be carried out as soon as the holds have been emptied or when they contain only ballast or other material, unattractive to rodents, of such a nature or so disposed as to make a thorough inspection of the holds possible. A Deratting Exemption Certificate may be issued for an oil tanker with full holds; (b) one or more preliminary derattings of a ship with the cargo in situ, or during its unloading, may be carried out to prevent the escape of infected rodents; (c) if the complete destruction of rodents cannot be secured because only part of the cargo is due to be unloaded, a ship shall not be prevented from unloading that part, but the Medical Officer or other authorised Officer may apply any measure which he considers necessary to prevent the escape of infected rodents, including placing the ship in quarantine. (3) On arrival of a ship having on board a person suffering from pulmonary plague, or if there has been a case of pulmonary plague on board a ship within the period of six days before its arrival, the Medical Officer may — (a) carry out the measures set out in paragraph 1 of Part I of this schedule; (b) require any person on board to be placed in isolation for six days reckoned from the date of the last exposure to infection. B. Ships which have been in infected areas (4) The Medical Officer may — (a) place under surveillance any suspect who disembarks; the period of surveillance being reckoned from the date of the departure of the ship from the infected area; (b) regard as suspect any person not isolated for 6 days before departure from an area with an epidemic of pulmonary plague; (c) require, in exceptional circumstances and for well founded reasons, the destruction of rodents on the ship and disinsection, but he shall give the Master notice in writing of the reasons for the requirement." Plague being primarily a disease of rats all vessels are inspected immediately on arrival at their berths in the docks and river for the presence of any mortality among the rats on board which is not attributable to any known cause, such as trapping, poisoning, etc. 16 Incidentally one of the "Health Questions"on page 1 of the "Maritime Declaration of Health" requires the Master to answer "Yes" or "No" to the question "Has plague occurred or been suspected amongst the rats or mice on board during the voyage, or has there been an abnormal mortality among them?" Any dead rats are immediately sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory at County Hall for examination for pasteurella pestis, each being accompanied by a label on which is given precise information as to where the rat was found in order to pinpoint the focus of infection should the examination prove positive. In the event of a positive result the "additional measures" referred to above would be put into operation — the discharge of the cargo would be promptly stopped and arrangements made for the vessel to be fumigated throughout with hydrogen cyanide, with the cargo in situ, the vessel being moved to an approved mooring. Following the initial fumigation and collection of dead rats resulting therefrom, further samples of such rats would be submitted for examination and the discharge of cargo would be permitted under observation. The destination of the cargo would be forwarded to the Medical Officer of HeaJth of the district to which it was proceeding, together with an explanatory note. If any of the cargo had already been discharged overside into lighters before the discovery of plague infection, the lighters would be fumigated immediately. On completion of the discharge of cargo from the vessel a second fumigation would be carried out, again using hydrogen cyanide, to destroy the residual rat population, if any. SECTION XII MEASURES AGAINST RODENTS IN SHIPS FROM FOREIGN PORTS (i) Procedure for inspection of ships for rats The Port Health Authority employs an experienced and competent team of fifteen Technical Assistants, who exercise control measures on all ships and shore premises within the Port area under the supervision of the Port Health Inspectors. The Technical Assistant's first duty is to visit all ships arriving in his district as soon as possible after arrival and to search for evidence of rodents. Priority is given to ships which have arrived from plague endemic areas. Further visits to these ships are made during the discharge of cargo to ascertain the degree of infestation on board, if any, and to ensure that reasonable measures are adopted to reduce the number of rodents on board to a negligible number and prevent any rodents escaping ashore. His second duty is the inspection of ships in his area for the specific purpose of issuing Deratting or Deratting Exemption Certificates or Rodent Control Certificates. His third duty is the inspection of shore premises and lighters for signs of rodent infestation. The Port Health Authority has continued to operate a Rodent Control Scheme inaugurated initially in July, 1941, covering all the docks and including all the premises of the Port of London Authority on behalf of that Authority and premises of tenants of the Authority on behalf of the occupiers. (ii) Arrangements for the bacteriological or pathological examination of rodents with special reference to rodent plague including the number of rodents sent for examination during the year. All dead rats to be examined for evidence of plague are promptly dispatched in cylindrical aluminium containers with a screw cap to the Public Health Laboratory at County Hall. Specimen rats are placed in polythene bags previously dusted with gammaxene powder to kill any parasites, labelled and placed inside the cylinder for delivery by hand. During the year eight rats were sent to the Laboratory at County Hall and were examined forplague with negative results. (iii) Arrangements in the district for deratting ships, the methods used and if done by a commercial contractor, the name of the contractor. (a) The burning of sulphur at the rate of 3 lbs per 1,000 cubic feet of space for a minimum period of 6 hours. This method is seldom used now in the Port of London. (b) The generation of hydrocyanic acid gas by various methods. For the destruction of rats a minimum concentration of HCN at the rate of 2 ozs per 1,000 cubic feet of space is required with a minimum of two hours exposure. 17 (C) Sodium-fluoroacetate ("1080") and "Warfarin". "1080" as a rodenticide has been regularly used throughout the docks for some time with highly satisfactory results. The prohibition on the use of "1080" and "1081" (Sodium Fluoroacetamide) except in ships and sewers, which was imposed in June, 1965, was amended during 1970 to permit their use also in enclosed dock premises. The deratting of ships by "1080" in preference to the use of cyanide results in a considerable saving of time and cost to the ship owner. (d) Trapping This method is seldom used except as an expedient to eliminate isolated rats and/or to secure specimens for the laboratory. (e) Methyl Bromide Methyl Bromide is a gas at ordinary temperatures but can be liquefied by pressure, and it is in the liquid form in the cylinders in which it is usually distributed. The gas, which is colourless, is heavier than air, consequently heavy concentrations are often found at floor level in the early stages of a treatment. However, the gas is not difficult to disperse after an operation. Apart from this density effect, the gas has greater powers of penetration than most other fumigants in common use and this applies not only to penetrati'on into commodities but also through walls and sealing materials. A high standard of maintenance and sealing is necessary in rooms to be used for fumigations using methyl bromide. The penetration powers of methyl bromide, the absence of smell, the lack of immediate symptoms of poisoning and the long term effect of poisoning, make it essential that adequate precautionary measures should be taken at all stages from the manufacture of the fumigant to the declaration of freedom from danger at the conclusion of operations. The precautionary measures and the additional precautions for the treatments of ships which are to be followed are laid down in a Home Office Pamphlet dated 1960. The fumigation of ships by methyl bromide, usually for disinsection purposes, occurs only occasionally in the Port of London. The exposure to the gas depends on the concentration and on the period and purpose of the exposure. For example in the case of a ship with completely empty holds, 12 ozs of liquid per 1,000 cubic feet for 12 hours would eradicate a rodent infestation in the holds, whereas a minimum concentration of 32 ozs per 1,000 cubic feet for 24 hours would be required in the case of Khapra beetle infestation. The following are the names of the firms approved for carrying out the deratting of ships: — Contra-Pest Service Ltd. Rentokil Laboratories Ltd. (iv) Progress in Rat Proofing of Ships No change.

Of the 2,322 lighters inspected for rodent indication 1,516 were inspected on the River District and the remaining 806 inspections were carried out in the respective dock groups. It will be observed that there has been a decrease in the number of inspections. This was due to the fact that the middle and upper River District launch was out of commission for repairs from the 2nd August, 1973, until 9th October, 1973. It will be noted by referring to the attached table that the degree of infestation is still decreasing and the following figures for last year are very encouraging. Of the 2,322 lighters inspected 96% were found notto have any rodent evidence at all, 3% of inspections with negligible, very slight fresh, or old evidence (no action taken), and only 1% of inspections required treatment. Thirty-five rats were recovered after treatment and the average number of rats recovered per lighter treated was 1.4. The above mentioned figures are the lowest ever recorded. 19 Importance of Rodent Control Measures on Lighters. No change. Economic Burden. No change. Rodent Suppressive Measures. Fumigation, poisoning, trapping and rat proofing No change. Cleanliness and Hygiene. No change. The methods of deratting lighters employed throughout the year were:- Fumigation Rodenticides Trapping 1. Sulphur Dioxide. 1. Sodium mono-fluoroacetate. 2. Methyl Bromide. 2. Multiple dose poisons. The method of treatment is determined by the condition and degree of infestation of the lighter at the time of inspection. In nearly all instances there is a residue of water and food stuffs in lighters when empty, and from past experience it has been found that if treatment is required,due to the time factor.it is far more efficient to fumigate than use a rodenticide. During the course of the year 186 lighters were fumigated with Methyl Bromide for insect control of the commodity. As the dosage required varies from 20 to 30 ozs. per 1,000 cubic feet, according to the species of the insect pest present, the chemical properties of the mentioned fumigant and the 24 hour exposure period required for Methyl Bromide are more than adequate to destroy any rats that may be present in the lighter at the time of fumigation. There has been a further reduction in the number of lighters fumigated for the commodity within the Port, the main reason being the increase of containerisation of many more commodities, especially dried fruits. Instead of the commodity being fumigated in the lighters when off loaded from the ship, fumigation is carried out in the container prior to loading aboard the ship at the port of loading. During the course of the year facilities for the examination of rats at the Public Health Laboratory at County Hall were transferred to the Public Health Laboratory at Dulwich. Only two of the rats that were recovered from treated lighters were sent for examination and on each occasion P/pestis was not isolated. Although there has been a further decrease in the number of dumb lighters trading within the port, the Lighterage Industry serves as an essential link in the resources of the port, conveying cargoes of incoming ships to riverside wharves, factories, public utility undertakings and railheads extending along both banks of the Thames, adjacent canal and creek networks. The Lighterage service today is operated with a modern and specialised plant, conveying a considerable amount of the tonnage of general cargoes passing through London, plus a large amount of petroleum and other specialised commodities and materials. With continued modernisation and the introduction of specialised craft the Lighterage service is still very much an integral part of the life of the port. 20 The number of dumb lighters trading within the Port of London Health Authority's jurisdiction is as follows: — Open Craft 751 Hatched Craft 801 Insulated Craft 90 Refrigerated Craft 5 Tank Craft 123 Grating Craft 8 Contractors Craft 53 Pontoon Craft 47 Punt Craft 14 Canal Craft 126 Bow Section Craft 1 Catamaran Craft 2 TOTAL 2,021 RODENT CONTROL ON LIGHTERS, YEAR ENDING 1973 Number of Lighters inspected 2,322 Number of Lighters without any evidence 2,227 Number of Lighters with negligible fresh or old evidence.

In view of the fact that Lash Lighters and Sea Bee Lighters trade between various places on the inland waterway system in the U.S.A. and Europe carrying general cargo and cereal produce, it is important that there must be a system of control regarding rodent infestation. Of the 740 Lash and Sea Bee Lighters that were discharged in the port during the course of the year 1973, 191 were inspected for rodent infestation, equivalent to a 26% inspection, and on each occasion there was not any evidence of rodents. Construction No change. Harbourage No change. As in the past every assistance has been received from the Lighterage Industry in our efforts to reduce rodent infestation to a minimum in lighters and I do feel that, by the combined efforts of education, source reduction and rat-proofing, rodent infestation in lighters can be reduced to, and controlled at, a minimum.

On the 18th January, 1973, an Order made under the Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations by the Common Council of the City of London came into operation. This Order prohibited the sale orexposure ordistribution or offer for sale of Oysters, Mussels, or other Molluscan Shellfish from defined waters, unless such shellfish were subjected to satisfactory cleansing processes. The Order in fact included all the waters used by the various oyster producers within the Port Health Authority's jurisdiction and all interested parties were notified of its content. The various producers made their own arrangements regarding the cleansing of oysters harvested from the area. Some subjected their catches to Ultra Violet Sterilization in approved plants, whilst others relaid them in pure water. A certain amount of relaying was carried out, but this was not done within the Port Health District. Oysters were collected and then relaid in the waters of the River Crouch, their final control after a period of self-cleansing being undertaken by the adjacent Health Authority. Towards the end of the year, one of the larger merchants engaged in the industry received approval to operate a new Ultra Violet Sterilization plant at Burnham-on-Crouch. Oysters from within the District and subject to the 1973 Order when collected were removed to this plant for cleansing, Burnham U.D.C. Health Department being responsible for the final product. Another merchant had informal discussions with Port Health Authority officers regarding a proposal to establish a similar installation in the Paglesham Area, but up to the end of the year no definite proposals had been received. The major works of reconstruction to the Stambridge Sewage Works were completed by the end of the year and it is to be hoped that, in due course, when various initial difficulties have been overcome, the improved effluent will have the desired effect of a very much cleaner River Roach. COCKLE INDUSTRY A number of routine inspections were carried out at the Cockle Sheds, Leigh on Sea, where this industry is based. Cleanliness of the sheds and sterilisation of the catches continue to maintain the standard required by this Authority. There has been no change in ownership of any of the sheds, this being a condition that has existed for many years, with the result that the Industry in the main retains certain old family names. Regular catchment areas appear to be becoming partly depleted consequently 'catches' are being gathered outside our 'prescribed area' by the cocklers. The possibility of the Foulness Area becoming an Air and Seaport continues to worry the Cockle Industry generally. SECTION XV MEDICAL INSPECTION OF ALIENS AND COMMONWEALTH IMMIGRANTS 1.

SECTION XVI MISCELLANEOUS Arrangements for the burial on shore of persons who have died on board ship from infectious disease. No change. THE CLEAN AIR ACTS 1956 AND 1968 THE DARK SMOKE (PERMITTED PERIODS) (VESSELS) REGULATIONS 1958 It has been found that formal smoke observations are very time consuming and often in the end do not necessarily establish evidence that an apparent contravention of the Regulations has been committed. It is the policy, therefore, of the Authority to seek the co-operation of ship-masters to maintain so far as possible a smoke free Port. To this end Port Health inspectors immediately notify the master of any ship which starts to make smoke of such density as to be likely to contravene the Regulations, so as to terminate the emission. In this connection 63 verbal notifications were given. However, during the year it was found necessary to carry out 55 smoke observations and in 25 cases there was a minor infringement of the permitted periods. There were 54 inspections of plant and equipment with further revisits to ensure that defects had been rectified. Eleven notices were served on the masters of foreign owned vessels and a copy of the notice was sent to the country's Consulate. The reasons for these contraventions were fully investigated and in view of the explanations received, no legal action was taken. Warning letters were, however, sent to each owner. 24 THE TRANSPORTATION OF REFUSE BY LIGHTERS Routine Bye-law inspections of loaded refuse lighters continued during the year. A good standard of covering with tarpaulins was maintained until November, when the two Companies in the trade were contacted concerning the slowly deteriorating standard. The problem was due to the unavailability of new tarpaulins, which have since been obtained. Observations during the loading of barges at the five refuse transfer wharves were also maintained, and a good standard was achieved. This standard was particularly noticeable at Cringle Street depot where the refuse is pulverised andfed to barges by chutes undercover. Chelsea Wharf, which closed at the end of 1972, had to be used several times as it was held in reserve until Cringle Street depot became fully operative. The use of Chelsea Wharf caused many complaints from the nearby houseboat residents at Cheyne Walk who, having enjoyed the closed down periods, resented the re-openings. The following approximate tonnages are handled daily by the refuse wharves — Cringle Street Depot 500 tons Feathers Wharf 400 tons Grosvenor Dock 700 tons Wallbrook Dock 450 tons Northumberland Wharf 400 tons Say 2,500 tons daily The barges employed in this trade now number about 155. 115 owned by Cory Bros, carrying about 2,000 tons daily. 40 owned by Cunis Ltd. carrying about 500 tons daily. Daily Tons 2,500 HOUSE BOATS The individual survey continued during the year and was made a special project in October. The road development plan at Chelsea appears to have been altered so that the houseboats at Cheyne Walk are at present not likely to move further out into the tideway. There is, however, a plan for redesign of the site and to bring the houseboats onto fixed plumbing and sewage disposal. Repairs continue to be carried out by owners during normal maintenance, and when infringements of the Authority's Bye-laws are drawn to their attention. Four houseboats were found to be in a very poor condition and were broken up. A further four are due for breaking up in 1974. There were two cases of houseboat owners complaining of fleas. Both vessels were sprayed throughout. 158 houseboats were moored in the Upper Reaches of the river between Tower Bridge and Teddington at the end of the year, of which all but eleven have been visited. Entry was gained to 63, and in general a good standard was found. DANGEROUS DRUGS During the year ten certificates authorising the purchase of scheduled Dangerous Drugs were issued under the Dangerous Drugs (No. 2) Regulations, 1964, Regulation 13(2) of which is as follows: — (a) The master of a foreign ship which is in a port in Great Britain shall be authorised to procure such quantity of drugs and preparations as may be certified by the medical officer of health of the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absence, by the assistant medical officer of health, to be necessary for the equipment of the ship until it reaches its home port. (b) A person who supplies a drug or preparation in accordance with a certificate given under this paragraph shall retain the certificate and mark it with the date on which the drug or preparation was supplied and keep it on his premises so as to be at all times available for inspection. In addition, one certificate was issued under Regulations 8(1) and 9(1) of the Dangerous Drugs (No.2) Regulations, 1964. This is a special authorisation, allowing the masters and owners of ships navigating between places in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland to be in possession of a supply of morphine. 25 One of the conditions laid down in the special authorisation and set out in Merchant Shipping Notice No. M.571 is:- "(a) No person shall obtain any supplies of morphine, unless the application is certified by the medical officer of health for the port health authority within whose jurisdiction the ship is or, in his absence, by the assistant medical officer of health, to the effect that they are necessary for the equipment of the ship." THE FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1970 The purpose built floating restaurant "FATHER THAMES" came into service in June, based at Cadogan Pier, Chelsea. Midday and evening trips are normally run between Cadogan Pier and Greenwich. The launch "VALULLA" also came into service and joined the "SUERITH" based at West India Dock Pier. These launches are employed in daily tripping and chartered evening outings when food is served. Work on the second launch to join "CHERRY GARDEN" neared completion. It is expected to be in service for the 1974 season and will be named "MAYFLOWER GARDEN". Two other new launches, "TIDEWAY" and "GREENWICH BELLE" were also nearing completion at the end of the year. They are for delivery in 1974, to trade from Westminster Pier. Two other launches have had their keels laid, so the interest in the recreational aspect of the river continues. Work on converting the "MAID OF ASHTON" into a floating restaurant to replace the "HISPANIOLA" commenced in February. Work has been slow due to the steel shortage and planning permission problems. For the future, there are four proposals for vessels as floating restaurants in various planning stages. A planning application to moor the "DUCHESS OF HAMILTON" as a floating restaurant was rejected by Westminster City Council. A hovercraft service between Greenwich Pier and Westminster commenced but only individual bottles of drinks are served with disposable glasses, at present. A new cafe was constructed on Charing Cross Pier and opened in June to the public, bringing the number of floating restaurants to eleven. There are also, in the Authority's district, thirty-six launches serving food and two kiosks. 158 inspections were made and a good standard of food hygiene was found. Informal notices were required in a few cases to have infringements of the Regulations rectified, but most owners maintained a high standard or, carried out work when required at the time of an inspection. A slight rodent infestation on one of the floating restaurants was dealt with by a "1080" poison treatment, which appears to have been successful. Water sampling was continued throughout the year as follows:- Routine Sampling Re-Sampling Suspicious Satisfactory Suspicious Satisfactory Launches 9 14 NIL 4 Piers, etc. 2 16 NIL 2 Floating Restaurants 3 20 NIL 3 Due to staff shortages at the laboratory, water sampling was kept to the more necessary work such as the testing of water supplies on new vessels and one which was closed for refit. Good results were obtained after chlorinating and flushing out the F.W. systems, and before the vessels began trading. Food Poisoning On the 28th July, information was received from the Health Department of the London Borough of Southwark that a local G.P. had notified them of four people who were suffering from suspected food poisoning. All four had eaten a meal on a River Thames Passenger Launch on the evening of the 27th July. The Port Health Inspector on the River District immediately visited the launch, where it was ascertained that it had been hired for a private party of approximately 140 people, for an evening cruise on the river during which time a cold buffet meal had been served. A guest list was obtained from the organiser of the party and a full investigation of the incident was instituted. The Medical Officers of Health of the areas where the guests were resident were informed and requested to trace the guests and ascertain the food eaten and whether or not they had been unwell. A total of 47 people were found to have suffered from food poisoning symptoms nearly all of whom had eaten chicken. One person had been removed to hospital for treatment. 26 Investigations into the possible source of contamination were carried out on board the launch. Samples of drinking water were sent to the laboratory together with pieces of chicken, gammon and gateau remaining from the cold buffet. All other food had been destroyed. The Public Health laboratory found Staphylococcus aureus in the chicken pieces. Arising out of the investigation into the preparation and transit of the food, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated by the laboratory from a fingerdressing of one of the shore based food handlers and the same organism was also isolated from a swab taken from food preparation surfaces at the caterers premises. From an examination of all the data collected it would appear that the chicken pieces were probably the food responsible for the outbreak and it would seem likely that the faults in preparation were:- (i) handling of warm precooked chicken and (ii) prolonged storage, probably at room temperature which allowed growth of the organisms and toxin production. The Department of Health and Social Security were informed of the occurrence. LONDON MARINA ROYAL ALBERT DOCK BASIN The basin was given a new lease of life when it was first opened as the London Marina in June 1972. Its situation is unique, being a locked basin on the Tidal Thames only six miles from the heart of the City. For small craft there is no restriction in length, draft, and height of truck. There is room to moor 450 boats and during 1973, the first full year of operation, nearly 150 boats have been moored, including visiting yachts from France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Sweden and Denmark. The moorings are served by eight floating pontoons with small finger moorings branching off the main pontoon with mains electricity supply. On shore there are additional facilities which include a locker room, mast store, toilets, showers, a launderette and drying facilities. There is also a 'Roast and Toast' Kiosk from which hot meals, hot snacks, hot and cold drinks may be purchased. The new amenities completed during the year included a completely re-fitted toilet block to provide a more modern toilet arrangement with hot and cold water supply and showers for both sexes. The London Marina Yacht Club also opened a club house to provide a social meeting place for members of the club and visiting yachtsmen and women. As part of the yachting complex the old cargo sheds on the north quay have been altered and are now used for dry boat storage, boat building and repairing, yacht chandlery and other ancillary enterprises. The sheds themselves have been repainted and in one case refronted giving the dock an appearance more in keeping with its new leisure image. Through liaison with Messrs. Boatex and the River Pollution Department of the Port of London Authority every endeavour has been made to introduce and maintain up to date services for the marina with particular attention being paid to the risk of pollution and environmental health control within the marina. 27 FOODSTUFFS DETAINED FOR EXAMINATION AND EITHER CONDEMNED AS UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION AND DESTROYED, RECONDITIONED, OR DISPOSED OF FOR ANIMAL FEEDING OR MANUFACTURING PURPOSES UNDER GUARANTEE The total amount of foodstuffs dealt with during the twelve-month period ended 31st December, 1973, was 1,586 tons, 11 cwts. 3 qrs. 11 lbs.

There was a slight reduction of tonnage received for this year of 191,000 tons, this years total imports being 1,589,000 tons. The Port of London Authority announced a multi-million pound project to develop two mill sites adjacent to the Terminal. The new maize milling complex will produce glucose, dextrose & corn sugars, and other starch derivatives. The new complex is scheduled for completion late in 1975. THE "HOLIMA" REFRIGERATION SYSTEM Associated Container Transportation (Australia) Limited, the world's largest operator of refrigerated container services, installed a special refrigeration system, the first of its kind in daily operation anywhere in the world - to cater for insulated containers carried on the run from Australia and New Zealand. Called the 'Holima' system, it will greatly reduce the storage problem of such perishable cargoes as meat and fruit when a containership comes into the port of London. There are now 12 units in operation at Tilbury. A major feature of the system is its flexibility and the speed with which each unit can be re-erected. Under the current schedules, the majority of refrigerated cargo being shipped by the new ACTA/ANL service from Australia/New Zealand is unloaded at Tilbury, but should demand alter, each unit can be quickly detached from the main stack and re-assembled in a new site within 72 hours. Based on a 20' x 8' x 8' machinery compartment, the Tilbury units are stacked in double tiers. Ducting leads off the machinery compartment on either side giving the complete stack an overall size of 180' x 8' x 16'. With a double tier on each side of the unit, each stack has a capacity of 48 containers. Air Circulation Cold air, at a controlled temperature of between 0°F and 55°F (at an ambient temperature of 80°F) is circulated along the ducts and into the individual units by centrifugal fans. Each container receives a minimum of 1,000 cubic feet of cold air per minute via two valves, the lower one allowing coid air into the container and the upper extracting it, to ensure an all round flow throughout the cargo. Fruit Storage To provide immediate visual indication of faults etc., a system of lights is employed indicating power on/off; defrost in operation; temperature control; and faults in the system. Provision is also made to introduce fresh air into the ducts to control C02 concentration when storing fruit. 35 THE 'HOLIMA' REFRIGERATION SYSTEM AT TILBURY DOCK 36 CONTAINER TRAFFIC - TILBURY The various terminals engaged in container operations continued successfully during 1973. The total number of container ships arriving increased once again, and the year produced a total of 1,489 compared with 1,420 in 1972. The number of imported containers rose to nearly 130,000. 40 Berth At the beginning of the year this terminal was handling short sea trade traffic to Zeebrugge, East Germany, Scandanavia and Portugal, and North Atlantic traffic to the U.S.A. and Canada. In April the Port of London Authority reorganised their container workings and established this terminal as a "Short Sea Trade" berth with regular sailings to ports in Holland, Belgium and Germany, all other trades being transferred to 41/43 Berth. 41, 43 & 45 Berths These three terminals operated by the P.L.A. as a single multi-user unit, form the largest container handling complex in Tilbury Dock. As the year progressed some of the trades increased, whilst others ceased operations. Services to the Pacific Coast of North America continued to flourish and expand and the Leningrad service showed a substantial increase. This service to Russia which also dealt with Far East traffic by use of the Trans Siberian Railway produced 30 arrivals in 1971 and 47 in 1972. During 1973, 72 vessels were dealt with, and four vessels were engaged permanently on maintaining the service. The New Zealand/Australian Trade which commenced operating from this terminal in September 1972, had a successful year and 27 vessels were dealt with. Unfortunately in the late summer, due to manning difficulties, 41 Berth ceased operations and remained closed for the rest of the year. In June an Atlantic trade left Tilbury to operate elsewhere, and in the new year a service to Spain and Portugal is to transfer its operations from Tilbury to Victoria Deep Water Wharf. The number of imported containers dealt with on the "Multi User Terminal" rose by nearly 15,000 to a figure of 77,792. The Port of London Authority's target of 200,000 containers import and export for 1973 was not achieved, but the 1972 figure of 121,921 was increased by 25,616 to 147,537. 39 Berth This privately operated terminal had another successful year. It is only used by vessels operated by two companies, one engaged in the Australian Trade, and the other to Canada. 97 vessels were dealt with during the year compared with 75 in 1972. 39,673 imported containers were handled. 26 Berth This privately operated terminal handling the Swedish ferry service was very busy during 1973 and handled 207 vessels, compared with 191 in 1972. 12,356 imported containers were handled. STRANDING OF FOOD CONTAINERS DUE TO STRIKE ACTION There was a pay strike from the 10th October to 14th November by clerks employed by A.C.T. at Manchester and Tilbury. This had the effect of stranding 580 containers of chilled meat (valued at some £10m.) in Tilbury Dock, and 10 containers of oranged. These containers were connected to the Holima refrigerator system in Tilbury Dock and liquid nitrogen was injected into the meat containers, to assist in cold temperature retention. The Port Health Inspectors at Tilbury kept a careful watch on these two foodstuffs throughout the period of the strike. Their condition had not deteriorated in any way when the strike finished and normal distribution for human consumption was allowed. 37 CHILLED MEAT FROM NEW ZEALAND An experimental consignment of chilled boneless beef and lamb from New Zealand was brought into Tilbury Dock in two containers on board the container vessel "ACT 1", which arrived on the 30th June, 1973. The containers, which had integral freezer units, were loaded in Wellington, New Zealand, from which port the vessel had sailed on the 30th May, 1973. Meat from New Zealand imported through London had hitherto been hard frozen, but the experimental consignment was maintained in a fresh condition by a recently developed method which involves keeping the meat at around freezing point. In view of the special nature of the consignment, it was allowed forward to Smithfield Market for first opening and inspection, where it was found by the market Meat Inspectors to be in good condition.

An exceptionally high standard of hygiene has been maintained throughout. Sheerness Harbour Stevedors Ltd., have provided all personnel with full protective clothing including foot covering for shipboard workers whilst handling carcase meat. A similarly high standard has also been achieved with the condition of all cargo handling gear. The Medway Ports Authority have provided a separate cleaning bay for the use of all vehicles engaged in meat transport and this also includes facilities for steam cleaning. In only one instance during the course of the year was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings against a haulage contractor under the Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers) Regulations 1960. At the Port Health Authority Meat Inspection Block, some 3,000 lamb carcases were examined and reconditioned following various forms of transit damage. In the course of normal inspection some 55 tons of meat were detained of which 26 tons were re-exported with the remainder being released to the Authority's Contractor for animal feeding purposes. 38 THE MEAT (STERILIZATION) REGULATIONS 1969 During the year, the following quantities of unfit meat and offals were imported for pet food manufacture:- DOCK COUNTRY OF ORIGIN NO.

All the samples were found to be satisfactory and in accordance with the particulars furnished by the vendors, having regard to the prescribed limits of variation. No samples of fertiliser were sent. 39 STUDENTS AND VISITORS Student Public Health Inspectors Five student public health inspectors were employed by the Authority during the year. Requests are received from other Local Authorities for training in port health duties (as required by the Public Health Inspectors Education Board) to be given to their students. These requests are always met and the visiting students usually spend two or three days receiving individual tuition in the Docks. Parties of students from the technical colleges have been accepted during the year and altogether 76 students each received two days training in this way. Visitors Other visitors who were shown various aspects of port health control work included doctors, public health inspectors, pupils from the City of London Freemen's School and students from places such as Belgium, Finland, Japan and Australia. DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACT, 1950, & ASSOCIATED ACTS Mr. G.S. Wiggins, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Officer for the City of London has submitted the following report:- Under the terms of the London Government Act 1963, the Corporation of London is responsible for the administration of the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, in respect of the importation of animals, for the whole of Greater London. Work carried out underthe various Orders concerning imported animals included the fol lowing:- Quarantine Facilities at Heathrow Airport The Port and City of London Health Committee has agreed in principle to the setting up of facilities for handling imported animals at Heathrow Airport. New legislation concerning the welfare of animals during international transport was introduced and has necessitated the revision of the plans. Meetings have been held, a site has been offered and plans have been drawn up for the facility. Diseases of Animals Act — Importations Following numerous reports that animals had arrived at Heathrow without the necessary licence of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, visits were made and arrangements made for 84 dogs, 37 cats, 405 monkeys, 3,257 mice, 9 mongooses, 2 coati mundis, 2 pottos, and one tapir to be placed into quarantine. Also 2 dogs, 4 cats, 79 monkeys, 39 rats, 78 mice and one tapir were re-exported. Licences were received for 102,468 animals to pass through the airport into quarantine. A post-mortem examination was carried out in October on an eight yearold poodle bitch which arrived dead from Antigua. The cause of death was heart failure with lung congestion. The carcase was properly disposed of and a report sent to the airline concerned. In January a person was bitten by a dog which was in transit at the airport. The person received medical attention and the dog was detained for 10 days before going to Paris. The Medical Officer of Health, Hillingdon and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were informed. Another biting case occurred in October when a boy was bitten by a dog which was suspected of having rabies. The boy received treatment and the animal was restricted for 15 days during which time it showed no symptoms of disease. It was necessary to address a letter to two airlines concerning the use of unsuitable vehicles to carry imported animals within the airport. 40 Other cases which occured concerning imported animals were:- March - Information was received that a dog had been illegally imported at Harwich and brought to London. The dog was placed into quarantine and statements and reports sent to Harwich. The owner was fined £5. May — A monkey was illegally imported at Tilbury and brought to Hampstead, London. The animal was removed to a zoo and reports and statements sent to Essex County Council. May - A report was received that two dogs had been illegally imported. Enquiries were made but no proof obtained. August — A monkey escaped from the R.S.P.C.A. Hostel, Heathrow, and was free for approximately five hours before being shot. August — A poodle was illegally landed at Dover and taken to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The owner was interviewed and statements and reports sent to Dover. No action was taken as the owner had left the country. September — A Pekinese dog was illegally imported at Heathrow and taken to an address in Putney, London. The dog was re-exported and the owners left the country. November - A cat, which had been illegally landed at Southampton, was brought to Waterloo Station. The animal was removed to Heathrow for re-exportation and reports, etc., sent to Southampton. Cautionary letters were sent. December — A Yorkshire terrier dog was illegally imported at Gatwick Airport and brought to Buckingham Palace. The dog was removed to Heathrow for re-exportation to Belgium. December — A letter was addressed to an airline concerning a consignment of imported mice which were left in extremely unsuitable conditions whilst awaiting collection. Protection Against Rabies Continuing the arrangement with the Medical Officer of Health, to provide vaccination against rabies, three members of staff received booster doses in June. Exported Animals Protection Order 1964 This Order contains regulations designed to prevent unnecessary suffering and for the protection of animals during transport. On 5th September a visit was made to Chambers Wharf, Southwark concerning the export of eight pigs to Portugal. Conditions were found to be satisfactory. The pigs were exported for breeding purposes. Export Certificates One hundred and three export certificates were issued to enable ten firms to export such varied commodities as grouse, pheasants, animal casings, dog biscuits, wood pigeon, quail, ducks, sweetbreads, cube rolls, livers, veal, various cuts of meat, rabbits, tongues, and roe deer. Also certificates were issued for the export of eight dogs and two cats. Countries of export were Jamaica, France, West Germany, Brazil, Holland, Kuwait, Singapore, Hong Kong, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Malta, Australia, Seychelles and Sweden. Acts and Orders 1973 Poultry and Hatching Eggs (Importation) Order 1972 Poultry and Hatching Eggs (Importation) Amendment Order 1973 The former Order which came into force on 1st February 1973 prohibits the importation of poultry and poultry eggs for hatching from countries other than Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, subject to certain exceptions. The second Order came into force on 22nd November 1973 and extended the prohibition to poultry and poultry eggs from Northern Ireland to Scotland. Equine Animals (Importation) Order 1973 Under this Order equine animals imported into Great Britain must be licensed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. It also gives power to require the re-export of illegally imported animals. 41 Export of Horses and Ponies (Increase in Minimum Values) Order 1973 This Order provides that, before horses and ponies can be exported, a veterinary inspector must be satisfied that the animal in question is worth not less than the prescribed minimum value. Importation of Canadian Cattle (Amendment) Order 1973 The importation certificate required for Canadian cattle is amended by this Order. A new requirement is freedom from clinical bovine enzootic leucosis.
