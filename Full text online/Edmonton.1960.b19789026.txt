HIS WORSHIP THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE BOROUGH OF EDMONTON Your Worship, Ladies and Gentlemen, The health of Edmonton improved somewhat during 1960. The infant mortality rate remained about the same but there was an improvement in neonatal mortality and peri-natal mortality. The known incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis fell sharply and it will be difficult to improve on this for some years to come. The general death rate fell and the birth rate rose. There was a reduction in the number of deaths of cancer of the stomach but this was balanced by an increase in the number of deaths from cancer of the lung. There was, however, a marked decrease in deaths of other forms of cancer, if Leukaemia be excluded. Deaths from Leukaemia rose slightly indicating an increase in the risk from radiation round about 1952/53. Influenza was not a serious problem and deaths from respiratory disease were somewhat reduced. A study of the Staff List on the opposite page will show that there was a full staff of Public Health Inspectors up till the 30th of September. The Smoke Control Area programme was therefore able to go forward at a faster pace and about 2,000 houses a year will be dealt with from now on. Smaller slum clearance areas were represented, but, since 390 houses were represented in 1959, the average of 200 houses per year has been maintained. - 5 - PART I.

F 93 Congestive Cardiac failure associated with fracture of femur - fall at home. Accidental - 8 - Accidents (Cont'd) Coal gas poisoning and fractures again account for most of the deaths. Only three of the victims were under 21. ANGINA There was a slight increase in the number of deaths from this cause. As usual about a third of the deaths were in persons under the age of 55. BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA The absence of a serious influenza epidemic reduced deaths from this cause. Smoke control measures may also have played a slight part in reducing the incidence of respiratory disease. CANCER OF THE LUNG There was a marked increase in deaths from lung cancer. Of the men who died in Edmonton in 1960 about 1 in 8 died of cancer of the lung. 6 of these men were under the age of 55 and more than half were under the age of 65. The cigarette smoker pays for his pleasure not only with his money, but also with years of his life. HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE Deaths from this cause remained about the same. There was, in fact, a slight fall. INFLUENZA There was only one death from influenza. LEUKAEMIA The deaths from this cause have again risen. There were only six deaths and of these two occurred late in life. - 9 - MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS There was a reduction in deaths from cancer of the stomach in both sexes. Possibly nutritional standards were a little higher in Edmonton than during 1959. DIABETES There was a marked reduction in the female deaths. As the numbers were small it will be necessary to watch the figures over the next few years. GASTRITIS, ENTERITIS AND DIARRHOEA Here there was a satisfactory reduction although it is regrettable that there should be any deaths at all from this cause. NEPHRITIS AND NEPHROSIS There were two deaths only in males. One occurred relatively early in life between 15 and 25; the other later between 55 and 65. TUBERCULOSIS The four deaths were all in persons aged between 65 and 75. Three were men and one woman. SUICIDE Again the number of suicides fell. If the trend continues the Edmonton suicide rate will be well below the national average. - 10 - TABLE VII DEATHS BY AGE-GROUPS Causes of Death All Ages - to 1 1 to 2 2 to 5 5 to 15 15 to 25 25 to 35 35 to 45 45 to 55 55 to 65 65 to 75 75 to 85 85 and Over Tuberculosis, respiratory 4 -

This was again less than the previous year (700 or so houses in 1958, 490 houses in 1959) and shows that housing conditions are improving somewhat. 114 houses in seven areas were represented for clearance. On February 8th, 1960, Bounces Road Area No.l. comprising 165-173 (odd numbers inclusive), Bounces Road and 1-6 Warley Road, Bounces Road Area No.2. comprising 177-213 (odd numbers inclusive) Bounces Road, 1-9 (odd numbers inclusive) - 17 - Walbrook Road, 2-12 (even numbers inclusive) Walbrook Road, 1-13 Huntingdon Terrace and 1-6 Elizabeth Villas, were represented. These areas contained between them 60 houses in which lived 206 persons. On March 7th, 3 small areas were represented. They were 362-364 Bury Street West (2 houses) 162164 Hertford Road (2 houses) and 180-186 (even numbers inclusive) Hertford Road (4 houses). 33 persons lived in these 8 houses.

Seventeen proved satisfactory. One sample of Rag Flock failed to satisfy the prescribed test. A warning was given to the manufacturer as it was found that there was no deliberate contravention of the Regulations made under the Act. A repeat sample was taken and proved satisfactory. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES There are eight public conveniences in the Borough under the supervision of the Senior Public Health Inspector. A new convenience in Pymmes Park with entry from Silver Street was opened early in 1960. No charge is made for the use of any part of any Public Convenience on either Male or Female side. Free hand washing facilities are provided and paper towels are supplied. An additional wash and brush up service is available on the payment of a small charge. There are two Attendants in each convenience, one on the Male and one on the Female side and premises are kept extremely clean and neat. There is no doubt that the public conveniences in Edmonton are among the best in the Metropolitan area. FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 AND 1948 The following work has been carried out under the above Acts:1.

It is the dust and grit falling through the air that they record, and it tends therefore to be pollution from factories and possibly railway locomotives that is mainly shown in deposit gauge results. The average level of pollution continues to show a slight decrease. A more accurate measure of air pollution is given by a volumetric filter which measures smoke and sulphur dioxide in the air. Continuous flow of air is pumped through the instrument and daily the sulphur dioxide is chemically measured and the stain produced by smoke measured by means of a filter paper. Details of the readings of the recorder installed at the Latymer School in May 1959 are set out overleaf. It is intended to install further instruments to replace the deposit gauges previously referred to. - 26 - 1960 Milligrams of Smoke per 100 cubic metres of air.

The Council has decided to make the Borough wholly Smoke Controlled and it is planned to deal with an area each year. No.l. Area containing 402 houses came into force on 1st June, 1959. No.2. Area (immediately adjoining No.l. Area) and containing 2,070 houses came into force on 1st October, 1960. No.3. Area. Survey work on this area was completed during 1960. The Order was confirmed by the Minister and will come into force on the 1st October, 1961. The area in question is bounded on the north by Church Street (from Victoria Road to the Great Cambridge Road) on the west, the Great Cambridge Road (from Church Street to Westerham Avenue) on the south, Westerham Avenue (from the Great Cambridge Road to Haselbury Road) and Park Lane (from Haselbury Road to Victoria Road) and on the east, Victoria Road (from Park Lane to Church Street). The area comprises about 213 acres immediately adjoining No.l. Area to the north, and No.2. area to the west, and contains the following buildings:- Industrial premises 1 Commercial premises 26 Private dwellings 1,715 Other premises 10 1, 752 27 - During the year 274 observations of industrial chimneys in the Borough were made by the Public Health Inspectors. RODENT CONTROL Your Senior Public Health Inspector, as Officer-in-Charge, Rodent Control, reported as follows:- An Assistant Rodent Officer and two Operatives carry out rat and mice destruction under the general supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Domestic premises are treated without charge and business premises on repayment. Wherever possible the poison used in treating infestations is "Warfarin" which is very successful and comparatively harmless to human beings and domestic animals. In cases where rat infestations are suspected to be due to faulty drainage, the Public Health Inspector makes a full investigation and where repairs are found to be necessary, the matter is taken up with the owner.

During the year the applicants numbered 4,416. One hour daily is allowed for such distribution with the exception of Fridays and Saturdays. A Formalin Chamber is used for the disinfection of books, leather goods, etc., articles that would be damaged by steam. The number of books and other articles thus disinfected was 315. Nine Council properties and 68 other houses were found to be infested; the total number of rooms disinfested was 206. The whole of the work is carried out by the Department, the materials used being insecticides containing D.D.T. as a base. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951 No new licences were granted during the year.

During the year 7 new licences and 120 renewals were granted by the Council. The following is a list of particulars of quantities, etc., affected by these licences:- Petroleum Spirit 518,425 gallons Petroleum Mixtures 8,893 gallons Rubber Solution 100 lbs and 800 gallons PLACES OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT Twenty-three inspections of cinemas and other places of entertainment were made in accordance with the Circular of the Ministry of Health of 1920. Conditions were found to be generally satisfactory. EPIDEMIOLOGY DYSENTERY Most of the cases of dysentery notified or discovered were of Sonne Dysentery in school children. The disease can be said to have been epidemic in 1960 The epidemic had two waves, the first reaching its peak in February and March, the second reaching its peak in December. I say 'epidemic' because of the three schools mainly involved, two were infected with sulphonamide resistant bacilli and one with sulphonamide sensitive bacilli. There were therefore, two parallel epidemics. The control measures (supervised hand-washing, rinsing of hands after washing in antiseptic, disinfection of lavatory seats and chains twice daily and strict exclusion of children with digestive upsets) were in due course successful and the incidence of dysentery in the following year was negligible . WHOOPING COUGH There was a small epidemic of whooping cough which perhaps fortunately had its peak in August. No serious complications were reported. MEASLES There were scattered cases of measles but it cannot be said to have been an epidemic of the disease. - 33 - SCARLET FEVER There were scattered cases of Scarlet Fever throughout the year. Despite modern drugs Scarlet Fever is still not a negligible disease and complications still occur from time to time. Of the 71 cases notified, 38 were removed to hospital on the advice of their family doctor on social or medical reasons. TUBERCULOSIS There was a sharp drop in the number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis notified and some part of this is undoubtedly due to the success of the 1958 Mass X-Ray survey in detecting early cases. Vaccination against tuberculosis (B.C.G.) is beginning to play a part in reducing the incidence in the vulnerable 15-25 year group and those in middle life also showed a reduction. Tuberculosis however, is still a hazard for all of us throughout life and it still frequently occurs in families that do not expect it. FOOD POISONING There was no serious outbreak and the infections were confined to single families. It is probable that the increased attention that Inspectors have been able to give to food handlers and food preparing premises has helped to reduce the number of food infections. Tables T(l) and T(2) give details of the ages and sex of new cases of Tuberculosis, also deaths from the disease; this latter figure includes the deaths of non-notified cases.

LAUNDRY SERVICE In pursuance of the Council's powers of disinfection under the Public Health Act, a laundry service for incontinent persons was started in May 1959, in co-operation with the laundry section of St. Ann's Hospital, Tottenham. Collection and delivery was up to twice weekly as required, and during 1960, 5938 articles had been collected, laundered and delivered back. During this period 23 persons were catered for. In the main, this service is made use of by aged persons, but it is not restricted to the old, and the Borough is prepared to deal with soiled linen from persons of all ages if necessary. HEALTH EDUCATION Home Safety and the dangers of smoking were again the two subjects emphasised. The programme of illustrated talks to old people's clubs and organisations was part of the "Check that Fall" campaign continued during the first quarter of 1960, and members of the organisations completed questionnaires on four hazards in their homes at the end of each talk. Subsequently, such matters as sanitary defects and gas or electricity meters in awkward places were put right in the homes concerned. In October 1960, a reprint from the Readers' Digest on dangers in the home was distributed to the Public Libraries. During the period October to December 1960 there was a Home Safety Poster Competition in the schools. Smoking and cancer was highlighted by poster publicity during the Summer and a health bulletin distributed to the secondary schools in October. Senior forms in one of the Grammar Schools was asked to comment on the bulletin and they did so with some force. Their main criticisms were:- 1. That the bulletin was much too simple. 2. That in drawing attention to the dangers of smoking the Health Department was hitting a nail that was already home. In March 1960, it was decided to support the County Council's Immunisation Campaign by sending a letter to the parents of a new baby at three months. The letter simply congratulates the parents and suggests that although the worst three months are over, vaccination and immunisation will be a considerable help in getting the child through the dangers of the coming year. Assistance to the Elderly: In April 1960 I became Honorary Secretary of the Edmonton Welfare - 40 - Association and Mr. Sherwood, the Welfare Organiser, was transferred from the Town Clerk's Department to the Public Health Department. My report on the work of the Association for the period 1960/61 follows, but I would like to emphasise that this report is in the main the work of the Welfare Organiser and most of the credit for the efficient working of the Association must go to him rather than the Honorary Secretary. EDMONTON WELFARE ASSOCIATION ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION, 1960-61 The work of the Association for the year now under review has once again been one of steady progress as there continues to be ample evidence of the increased need of our services, and in paying its tribute to the magnificent work of the voluntary organisations affiliated to the Association, we are sensible of the fact that, without their co-operation and team work many of the present services would be seriously curtailed or, in fact, cease to function. We have to report that the Association and its method of working under a model constitution, continued to provide interest to a number of Local Authorities, and we are always pleased to receive the many visitors who are sponsored through the National Old People's Welfare Council and London Council of Social Service. It gives great pleasure to the Association to have this annual opportunity to thank the voluntary organisations for their magnificent work The British Red Cross Society, Women's Voluntary Service, Toc H., Citizens' Advice Bureau, St. John Ambulance Brigade, and the growing interest of the Churches of all denominations. We also record our close and happy co-operation with the Middlesex County Council Area Welfare Department, Superintendent Health Visitor, Middlesex County Council No.1 Area; Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance; National Assistance Board; Almoners of North Middlesex Hospital; League of Hospital Friends; local Doctors and the Officers and Staff of the Edmonton Borough Council. Through this generous measure of co-operation and willing help, working together in the field of social welfare in the Borough of Edmonton, a great number of people of all ages have been given help, and too, some new friendships have been formed and new interests of lasting happiness. This is the measure and purpose of our work together, and with true humility we all can be proud of the results. Given hereunder is a brief report of the work of some of the services of the Association during 1960-61. (a) MEALS-ON-WHEELS SERVICE During the year 1960, the Meals Service delivered no less than 13,382 - 41 - meals. Whilst this is 72 less than the record in 1959, nevertheless we have maintained our average of 1,000 meals per month excluding emergency cases, which we have never refused and we are satisfied that every case is in genuine need of this important service. The Association offer a very sincere tribute to all the ladies of the Women's Voluntary Service for their constant and cheerful duty, which is of inestimable value to the well-being of the people they serve and to Mrs. E. Everitt, Meals Organiser, in particular, whose untiring efforts are the inspiration to the success of the service, the Association offer a very warm tribute. We also offer our sincere thanks to the Edmonton Borough Council's catering staff and transport staff for their help and co-operation which plays its part in making this service one of the most outstanding in London. (b) ENTERTAINMENTS AND RECREATION The Edmonton Borough Council, through the Municipal Entertainments Department, have continued to maintain a very comprehensive programme of concerts to the Old People's Clubs. In addition, there have been the special Old Tyme Dances; special concerts at the Summer Theatre in Pymmes Park and the 'highlight' of the year is the Ail-Star Variety Concert at The Regal, and the special cinema show at The Granada. Free admission to plays, quiz contests etc., have also been available to the old people. There is no doubt that the old people greatly appreciate these facilities offered to them by the Edmonton Borough Council to whom we offer our sincere thanks. (c) VISITING SERVICE A great deal of valuable work is being done by the Old People's Clubs in Edmonton by not only visiting their sick members, but also sick visiting in their locality of sick old people referred to the Welfare Organiser by the National Assistance Board, Citizens' Advice Bureau and other agencies. This is one of the means by which lonely old people ultimately take up membership in the Clubs. The Association is anxious that its services should be widely known so that house-bound old people in particular, should avail themselves of the services in operation for their benefit, and it is hoped that all affiliated organisations will constantly give the utmost publicity to the work that is being done. (d) HOLIDAYS Information has been circulated to all the Old People's Clubs and affiliated organisations of the off-season holidays at reduced prices available to old people. There have been an increased number of personal enquiries from old people anxious to take advantage of these facilities. It is pleasing to note that there has also been an increase in the number of Old People's Clubs organising parties of their members going away together on holiday, and they return greatly benefited from their holiday with their friends. - 42 - (e) INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE The number of enquiries on a wide range of problems continues to increase, but the major problem for many old people is housing. We are pleased to report our continued happy association with the National Assistance Board, Citizens' Advice Bureau, Hospitals, Doctors and Police who refer many cases to us. It is accepted that the guiding principle of this work is that each case is individual and must be treated with courtesy, sympathy and understanding. Information is also circulated quickly and concisely by the 'News-Letter1 which is sent periodically to the Old People's Clubs, affiliated organisations and the local Press. (f) LIBRARY DELIVERY SERVICE This service organised by the Edmonton Borough Council Library is one of great value to physically handicapped and house-bound old people, and to-day 65 enjoy this courteous and efficient bi-weekly service. We offer the Borough Librarian and his staff our sincere thanks. (g) WELFARE FOOD SERVICE Once again this excellent service has broken all previous records by the sale of Bovril - 1,776 bottles, Ovaltine - 2,252 tins, and Marmite - 606 jars, of a total sale value of over £730 The Association is deeply appreciative of the excellent contribution of Mrs D,M. Dixon, Divisional Director, British Red Cross Society, Edmonton, and her staff, for operating this service on behalf of the Association. There is no doubt that the Welfare Food Service makes a definite contribution to the health and well-being of the old people, and the extension of this service by delivery of supplies to the Old People's Clubs on the day they meet, especially in the winter months, is greatly appreciated, and Mrs. Dixon and her staff can be sincerely assured that the extra work involved is very worthwhile. (h) HAIRDRESSING SERVICE The concessions offered by the members of the Edmonton Branch of the London and Provincial Hairdressers' Association are greatly appreciated, and this is proved by the many demands it receives from the old people who take advantage of the reduced prices, (i) ALL-DAY CLUBS The William Preye Club Since this Club was opened officially in January 1955, it has gone from strength to strength, and its constant success as a centre for elderly people is proud testimony of the excellent work of the officers and voluntary wardens, - 43 - all members of the Club, which is one of the best Clubs of its kind in the country. During the year under review, the Club voted for an annual outing instead of an annual tea-party, but there was a very happy New Year's Eve tea-party also. The 'Sale of Work' and 'Open Day' was a great success, and this, with the special work of the Sewing Corner and weekly Whist Drive, helped to increase the funds of the Club. The Annual Meeting of members agreed to meet the cost of renovating the easy chairs and re-covering the billiard, table, and as in previous years, the Club made a donation of £100 from their funds to the Association towards the cost of the Club, which, with its new lino-tiled floor and elegent redecoration is certainly a model of its kind. The Association would like to record its thanks and appreciation of the work done by the Management Committee, Officers and Voluntary Wardens and its Members. Pymmes Park Club for Old People During the year this Club has continued to provide an important social centre in the southern part of the Borough, and whilst its membership is predominantly male, it nevertheless enjoys the company of a few ladies, who assist in tea-making. The Club organised an excellent outing for its members, and with the help of Councillor Miss D.M. Oswald and a band of lady helpers, a magnificent Christmas meal was enjoyed by all the members. The Club has been one of the strong supporters of the Inter-Club matches with William Preye Club and Lord Morrison Hall Club, and they have provided great pleasure to the members of the three Clubs, and it is generally acknowledged that 'Pymmes Park' have had a very happy and successful year. It is with pleasure that the Association records its thanks and appreciation of their services to the Management Committee, Officers and Voluntary Wardens of the Club. (j) FOOT SERVICE The Foot Service Clinics operated by the British Red Cross Soceity, Edmonton, on alternate Mondays at William Preye Club and the Red Cross Headquarters, continue to provide an essential and efficient service to the old people who need urgent chiropody treatment. During the year under review, the Foot Clinic gave no less than 1,700 treatments and a number of these cases were brought to the Clinics by the Red Cross Ambulance. It is imperative that old people with foot ailments should have early treatment, and it is the courtesy and efficiency of this service which has earned the British Red Cross, Edmonton, the gratitude of its patients. As a token of appreciation for the special services given by the Red - 44- Cross, and in particular for the work done at these Foot Clinics for old people, the Edmonton Welfare Association has made a grant of £100 to the British Red Cross Society, Edmonton. (k) PUBLIC BATHS - RED CROSS SERVICE TO THE ELDERLY AND INFIRM The British Red Cross have continued to provide both a Male and Female Nurse each week at the Public Baths, Knights Lane, Edmonton, N.9, to assist elderly people and infirm old people attending the Slipper Baths. The Edmonton Borough Council have provided special safety rails in two baths, which are greatly appreciated. Further publicity of these facilities which are available would be appreciated at Old People's Clubs, whose members have difficulty owing to age or infirmity, in having a bath. (1) OTHER SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES (i) Other Services The work of the Radio Repair Service is now operated through Martin's Radio Limited, Edmonton, and we are grateful to Mr. Jolly and his staff for their help and kindness with emergency cases of radio repairs to old people. (ii) Harvest Festival Gifts and Easter Gifts The Association are grateful to the schools in Edmonton for the gifts they send us from their Harvest Festival Services and Easter Services for distribution to the old people. (iii) Work Centre and All-Day Club The Association have under active consideration, the promotion of a Work Centre and All-Day Club in the Borough of Edmonton, and the present position of this project is the subject of a special report to the Executive. It is the earnest wish of the Association that this scheme should come into operation as soon as possible. (iv) 'Good Neighbour Week' Exhibition From the 20th February to the 25th February, the Association staged an exhibition of work of the voluntary organisations, churches and youth organisations, showing how they linked together in service to the community. Whilst the attendance to the exhibition, the first of its kind in the country, was not as good as anticipated, both the Association and Exhibitors thought the effort well worthwhile. CONCLUSION The Association working through the Executive Committee with its wide - 45 - representation of interests in the field of social welfare, has shown once again the importance for the need of these services in the Borough of Edmonton. The true measure of our achievements has been the result of close and cordial co-operation with all the voluntary organisations working together as a team for the common good. With renewed confidence the Association and its affiliated organisations go forward together to maintain and expand the services it provides, and thereby, rightly holds a proud place in the field of social welfare in the Borough of Edmonton.
