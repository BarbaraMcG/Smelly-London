Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Fourteenth Annual Report on the vital statistics and the sanitary condition of the Borough, together with particular returns required by the Local Government Board and Home Office, for the year ending December 31st, 1914. The preparation and completion of the report has unfortunately been delayed by the serious depletion of the clerical staff, and other conditions due to the war. We are proud of the fact that all the members of the staff, who were of military age and physical fitness have with your permission enlisted. Of the clerical staff:—F. E. Seckerson, C. C. Summers, and P. C. Litten (the latter was seriously wounded in France and has, I am glad to say, made a splendid recovery, and rejoined his battalion) ; of the Inspectors, J. H. Berry and C. E. Holilield are doing good work with the Sanitary section of the R.A.M.C., to whom their special training will be valuable; of the Women Sanitary Inspectors, Miss Barke has leave during the period of the war so that her experience as a highly-trained nurse might be utilised, and she has been engaged in hospital work in France. 8 It will be easily understood that we have been somewhat handicapped by this depletion, which has now been overcome by the willingness of the remaining staff to give much additional help, and the appointment of two temporary Clerks, one office lad, and one Woman Health Visitor. From the statistical returns it will be seen that Lewisham still holds its satisfactory position as a healthy district. Its recorded death rate is 10.9 per 1000 persons at all ages living within the Borough. With the exception of Hampstead (which is 10.4 per 1000) it is the lowest death rate in London. The birth-rate shows a slight drop, being 19.5 per 1000 compared with 20.33 in 1913. It is satisfactory to record the low infant mortality rate, that is the number of infants dying under one year in relation to each 1000 born, which amounted to 78.5, also the lowest in London with the exception of Chelsea, which is 67 per 1000. Again Lewisham shows the lowest death rate but one in London from Phthisis. The total number of deaths from this cause amounted to a total of 126, equal to a death rate of 0.75 per 1000. Hampstead records show the lowest rate of 0.64 per 1000. During the months of August and September there occurred generally throughout the Borough a considerable rise in the incidence of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. Unfortunately, considerable delay and difficulty was experienced in obtaining isolation in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals owing to insufficient accommodation. Our efforts to prevent the spread of infection were seriously handicapped. Your Council again 9 urged upon the Metropolitan Asylums Board the urgent necessity of again bringing into use as an isolation hospital the Park Fever Hospital at Hither Green, which had unfortunately been converted into a children's hospital for Poor Law purposes. It was not until October 19th that our difficulties were removed, when the Park Hospital was re-opened and again used for its original purpose, viz : an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. I desire to draw your attention to the important memorandum issued by the Local Government Board dated July 30th, 1914, and relating to Maternity and Child Welfare. The Board point out they would be in a position to give grants in aid of the expenditure of Local Authorities and voluntary agencies in respect of institutions or other provisions for maternity and child welfare. The Board, while applauding the past efforts of local authorities to reduee the wastage of infant life, believe that further energies are required, as the following extracts show :— "Up to the present, local authorities, in their infant "welfare work, have concerned themselves more especially "with the child in its first year of life; the matter is, "however, one which needs to be dealt with on a more "comprehensive basis, and it is clearly desirable that "there should be continuity in dealing with the whole "period from before birth until the time when the child "is entered upon a school register, i.e., the register of a "public elementary school, nursery school, creche, day "nursery, school for mothers, or other school. "Extension of the existing work is accordingly needed "in two directions ; on the one hand it is necessary that "measures should be taken for securing improved ante"natal and natal conditions, and on the other hand, "provision should be made for continuing the work in "relation to children beyond the first year of life." 10 The importance of this matter cannot be over-estimated. On referring to the last Annual Report of the Registrar-General we find that of the total deaths, 504,975, registered in England and Wales during the year 1913, 95,608 or 18.9 per cent. occurred among infants under one year of age. Of the 95,608 infant deaths recorded in one year, Measles and Whooping Cough accounted for 4,704, Tuberculosis, 2672, Syphilis, 1,386, Infantile Convulsions excluding convulsions from teething, 7,069, Diarrhoea and Enteritis, 17,038, Premature Birth, 29,616. These figures alone are sufficient evidence that more and more energy is required by Public Health Authorities in applying measures to check this terrible wastage of life. Not only is life wasted as the result of preventable disease but a great deal of suffering and misery is produced in those who, although escaping death, may be so damaged during infancy by disease as to become physically unfit and even derelicts. I am sure your Council will appreciate the importance of carefully considering this subject in the near future. The question of the provision of treatment for Tuberculosis in the Borough still remains unsettled. It may be useful here to summarise the position. Your Public Health Committee considered a report of a scheme for Lewisham submitted by me at a meeting in July, 1912. The consideration was referred to a joint Committee of the General Purposes and Public Health Committees, who had before them a full detailed report and scheme. 11 After clue donsideration this Joint Committee reported to the Council on the 23rd October, 1912, recommending that steps be taken for the establishment in the Borough of a Tuberculosis Dispensary upon the lines of the scheme suggested by your Medical Officer of Health, the cost of site and buildings being estimated at £1.000. The recommendation of the Joint Committee was adopted by your Council, on the 23rd October, 1912. Correspondence was then opened with the Local Government Board asking for their provisional sanction. The Local Government Board suggested the Council should if possible lease or rent premises and adapt them for the purpose of a dispensary. Your Public Health Committee considered the suggestion but found it impossible to adopt, and further considered their original scheme the more economical. Difficulties then arose with regard to the original site selected in Mount Pleasant Road, and a new site was arranged for adjoining the baths at Ladywell. Detailed plans and estimates were then submitted to the Local Government Board and by the 9th March, 1914, the Local Government Board informed the Council that they approved generally of the Council's proposed scheme. On the 25th March, the Public Health Committee reported to the Council the Local Government Board's approval, and recommended that the sum required for establishing a Tuberculosis Dispensary in accordance with the Council's scheme should be raised by loan. The Council referred the matter back to the Committee. 12 Further reports were submitted by the Committee and on the 6th May, 1914, the Council resolved that the consideration of the subject be deferred for six months. The Public Health Committee again considered the question and reported to the Council on the 9th December, 1914, and recommended that (a) no further steps be taken for the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary in the Borough; (b) that the necessary arrangements be made for the appointment of an additional Tuberculosis Health Visitor. These recommendatious with the addition of the words (at present) to recommendation (a) were adopted by the Council. Since the Report has been in preparation we have had before us the Scheme of the London Insurance Committee for annual payments to be made to Borough Councils in London for complete dispensary services for insured persons. In the Scheme it is provided that Lewisham would receive an annual grant of £275. Assuming it cost eleven hundred pounds a year to maintain and work a Dispensary in the Borough, the following statement shows the amounts of annual grants which would be received in aid of such work and the small charge which would fall upon the ratepayers of the district for so great a benefit. £ s. d.

I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1915. VITAL STATISTICS. 17 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1914. YITAL STATISTICS.

There were 37,018 Families or Separate Occupiers (36,863 of these being "Private Families" as distinguished from Institutions, &c.), compared with 27,701 in 1901. The number of persons in "Private Families" was 155,241. The number of tenements with less than five rooms was 14,204, compared with 8,561 in 1901, and the total population living in tenements of less than five rooms was 48,458 as against 15,958 in 1901. The proportion of the population residing in tenements of less than five rooms was 30.12 per cent. compared with 22.67 per cent. in 1901. From the proportion of families living in tenements of less than five rooms one can form a fairly accurate idea of the social condition of a district. Of every 1,000 tenements of all kinds in the Borough 384 only consist of less than five rooms. The average for the County of London is 695, while the largest proportion is in the Borough of Finsbury, were 891 of every 1,000 tenements consist of less than five rooms. One-roomed tenements.— There were 1,303 one-roomed tenements in the Borough, housing a population of 1,921. Of these 1,303 tenements— 865 contained 1 person 306 „ 2 persons 90 3 „ 36 „ 4 „ 6 „ 5 „ So far as these one-roomed tenements are concerned, Lewisham also has the lowest proportion in London, only 35 out of each 1,000 tenements consisting of one room, exactly the same proportion as in 1901. 20 The number of tenements containing an average of more than two occupants per room was 850, housing a population of 6036. The percentage of the total population living more than two in a room in tenements of less than five rooms was 3.36, and again, in this direction, Lewisham enjoys the lowest proportion in the Metropolis. BIRTHS. Number of births (corrected) in 1914 3306 Average number in previous 10 years 3491 Birth rate per 1,000 in 1914 19.54 Birth rate, County of London 24.3 „ 97 Great Towns 25.0 „ England and Wales 23.8 The total number of Births registered in the Borough during the year amounted to 3,306. Fifteen of this number were born to parents whose usual place of residence was in other districts, and we were advised by the Registrar-General that 15 children were registered in districts outside, the parents of whom were residents of the Borough of Lewisham. The corrected number of births belonging to this Borough is therefore 3,306, the males numbering 1,723, and the females 1,583, which is equivalent to a birth-rate of 19.5 per 1,000 inhabitants. In 1913, 3,502 children were born, which shows in one year a decrease of 196 in the number of births. The birth-rate for the County of London was 24.3 per 1,000, for the 97 Great Towns, 25.0 per 1,000, and for the whole of England and Wales, 23.8 per 1,000. Illegitimacy.—The illegitimate births numbered 89, compared with 95 in 1913. 21 The following table shows the number of births occurring in the various Wards of the Borough, together with the rate per 1000 inhabitants:— Wards.

During the year 1914, 8412 notifications of births were received under the above-named Act. In 305 cases the notification was only received after a notice had been sent to the father from this Department. The following Table shows the number of cases notified, the person by whom notified, whether the children were born 22 alive or dead, and the total number of births registered in the Borough:— Total No. of Births Notified.

The number of Marriages in the Borough during the year was 1,195, compared with 1,070 in 1913, and 1,101 in 1912. Of this number, 667 were solemnized at the Established Church, 150 at Nonconformist Places of Worship, and 378 at the Register Office. MORTALITY.

The average number of deaths in the 10 years, 1904-13, was 1,728. The corrected death rate for the Borough was 10.98 per 1,000 of the population, compared with 10.68 per 1,000 in 1913. 23 The following Table shows the death rates in the various Wards of the Borough during the year under review, and the previous year:— Wards.

Enteric Fever.—Six fatal cases of this disease occurred, compared with eight in 1913, and an average of 3.9 for the ten years, 1904-13. Measles was certified to be the cause of six deaths, a large decrease on 1913, when twenty-five death occurred. Scarlet Fever was the cause of eight deaths. Whooping Cough. — Nineteen deaths were caused by this disease, eight of the victims being under one year of age. Diphtheria was the cause of twenty-four deaths, compared with thirty-five in 1913. Diarrhœa and Enteritis.—Fifty-three children under the age of two years died from these diseases, compared with fifty-one in the preceding year. 25 The following table shows the death-rates from the principal zymotic diseases in this Borough, and in the County of London, the 97 Great Towns, and England and Wales:— Enteric Fever.

The infectious diseases notifiable under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are :—Small-Pox, Cholera, Diphtheria, Membranous Croup, Erysipelas, the diseases known as Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever, and the Fevers known by any of the following names:—Typhus, Typhoid, Enteric, Relapsing, Continued or Puerperal; Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, and Acute Polio-Myelitis or PolioEncephalitis. The total number of cases notified during the year 1914 amounted to 1570, of which number 975, or 78-12 per cent, were removed for isolation to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals or other Institutions. In 46 instances, or 3.38 per cent, of the cases removed, the Hospital authorities returned the patient as not suffering from any notifiable disease. Deducting these from the gross total, we have a corrected total of 1524 cases of infectious disease notified as occurring in the Borough during the year, an increase of 309 compared with the total for the preceding year, which was 1215. In 1912, 1019 cases were notified. Age Periods. 40.95 per cent, of the Scarlet Fever cases, compared with 41.71 per cent, in 1913, and 46.65 per cent, of the Diphtheria cases, compared with 47.52 per cent, in 1913, occurred among children aged six years and under. The following figures show the percentage of cases occurring among children of the age of six years and under to the total notifications of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria:— Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria.

The attack rate from all infectious diseases (excluding Puerperal Fever) during the year amounted to 9.00 per 1,000 of the population, compared with 7.02 in 1913, and 6.18 in 1912. The attack rate for the County of London was 9.01, compared with 6.96 in 1913. The attack rates for the Wards will be found on page 56. It will be seen that Sydenham Ward had the largest number of cases in proportion to its population, having an attack rate of 10.40 per 1,000. The lowest attack rate was in Brockley Ward, 5.05 per 1,000. 53 Number of Cases of Infectious Diseases notified in the Ten Wards and the Whole Borough during the Year 1914.

The attack rate for the County of London was 5.54 per 1,000. An examination of the attack rates for the various Wards of the Borough shows that the highest occurred in Lewisham Village (7.35 per 1,000) and that the Ward least affected was South Ward, Lee, with 2.59 per 1,000. 48.46 per cent, of the cases occurred among children between the ages of 5 and 10 years, and 18.52 per cent, among children under the age of five.

The total number of workshops on the Council's Registers at the end of 1914, was 635. During the year 1397 inspections of these premises were made; and defects to the number of 99 were found. Want of cleanliness was reported in 17 instances. In only 7 cases was overcrowding of workrooms found. In no case was it found necessary to institute legal proceedings to obtain a remedy of the defects. In addition to the workshops mentioned in the preceding paragraph there are 217 part-time and domestic work-places, i.e., private houses or rooms where no power is used, and in which only the occupiers themselves are employed. The total number of workers employed in the 635 workshops referred to was 2142, of which number 1072 were women, 764 men, and 306 "young persons." 90 Inspection of Factories, Workshops & Workplaces.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † The figures required in columns 2, 3 and I are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries ol names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 93 Workshops (sec. 131) and Workplaces and Workrooms on the Register at the end of 1914 (Home Office Table, No. 4).
