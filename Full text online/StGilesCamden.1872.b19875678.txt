Gentlemen, 1. I purpose to review the sanitary operations of your Board during the past ten years, and I trust that I shall be able to present a satisfactory resume of the work done, without running into undue length of statement. The publication of the Decennial Census, by the Registrar General, affords the opportunity for such a review. The site of St. Giles District. 2. St. Giles District is admirably situated for the maintenance of a high standard of health. Its natural advantages are very great, and afford facilities for ventilation, drainage, and equality of temperature surpassed by few, if any, other localities in the metropolis. Dr. Buchanan, in his Report for 1858, stated some interesting facts on this point. The average elevation of the land in this District is about 68 feet above high-water mark; the British Museum, which stands about the centre of the upper plateau, being 72 feet above that datum. In Alfred Mews the elevation is 78 feet, but the land begins to fall in the line of Oxford Street and Holborn to about a level, next to the Strand District, of 53 feet. Hence, St. Giles enjoys the protection, towards the north and east, of the lofty hills of Hampstead and Highgate, and is sufficiently high above the river to escape the influence of the damp malarious fogs which usually hang, morning and evening, over low-lying districts. The Soil. 3. The soil on which it lies is a breadth of gravel, with occasional patches, several feet deep, of clay loam resting upo'n it. The gravel commences at the north, near Tavistock Square ; and, on the east by an oblique line, through Woburn Place to Brunswick Square, where the London clay crops to the surface. On the south, it extends, getting deeper as it falls, to the Strand; and on the west it runs through Marylebone and Kensington, where it is mixed with clay, to the suburbs. Supposing such a site to be in its natural state, it would be difficult to conceive one better adapted to promote the health of persons living upon it. The stratum of gravel taking all the surface drainage, polluted though it might bo by animal excrement and decaying vegetation, would purify it as it percolated through ; and, by 3 giving it rapid passage to the lower stratum, would prevent that dampness of the air which is caused by exhalations from earth soaked with moisture, and from stagnant pools. St. Giles should thus have a dry, pure and temperate atmosphere, as compared with those parts of London which rest upon a cold, wet, retentive clay soil. 4. Unfortunately these advantages have been well nigh destroyed. In order to make suitable roads and sewers, the gravel has been overlaid many feet in depth with a "made" soil, consisting of old brick-rubbish, and black earth saturated with the leakage from gas pipes, brick sewers, and cesspools, through which the local surface drainage cannot readily penetrate. The sewers are usually carried to a great depth ; and inasmuch as it has been the practice, until the last year, for the contractors to cart away the gravel dug out of the trenches, and to fill in with rubbish, the filtration through the gravel has been arrested, and our beautiful squares surrounded on all sides by sewers and a made soil, are liable to become damp from retaining an undue quantity of water. Your Board, seeing this evil, has wisely ordered that the contractors shall fill in the trenches in future with gravel; and it is to be hoped that this order will be rigidly adhered to. The Area. 5. The Area of St. Giles District, including therein the joint Parishes, consists of 245 acres, of which there are 112 in Bloomsbury, 63 in St. Giles South, and 60 in St. Giles North. Open Spaces. 6. This Area is, however, disposed of very differently for the purposes of habitation and roadway in the three sub-districts, and it is necessary to advert to these differences in order to obtain a clear conception of the social condition of the inhabitants. In the first place, Bloomsbury contains about 24 acres of open space, which is laid out in handsome squares, filled with a luxuriant vegetation; St. Giles South has 10 acres of space, including the noble area of Lincoln's Inn Fields; and St. Giles North only 4 acres—altogether 38 acres of space for ventilation and recreation. The houses surrounding the squares in Bloomsbury are large and spacious ; whilst those in St. Giles South are small and closely-packed in narrow streets and courts, receiving but little advantage from the fine area of Lincoln's Inn Fields, which is outside the densely inhabited parts of the District. St. Giles North holds an intermediate position as respects the open spaces. Area of Roads and Footways. 7. The Area of the lloads in St. Giles District includes 45-6 acres, and of Footways 21-2 acres. Hence there are about 104 acres of open space, roadways and footways, out of the 245 acres of land in the District. 8. This does not, however, fully state the case ; because the large yards and gardens, at the back of the best houses in Bloomsbury, show as much uncovered space as that included in roads and footways. Hence, Bloomsbury is highly favored by the mere arrangement of its site. On the contrary, the houses in St. Giles are so crowded together in the rear, that a large number of them have no yards at all, whilst the remainder, with rare exceptions, have yards so small that they hardly afford room for the necessary domestic accommodations. Under these circumstances there is not, and cannot bo, adequate ventilation, and men and children must sicken and pine from the mere want of air. 9. Paving. A considerable portion of St. Giles District is paved with granite cubes, necessitated by the traffic. The surface drainage from the granite is far better than, that from the Macadam. In fact, it can scarcely be said that the Macadamized roads, after long use, drain at all, on account of the unevenness of the surface and nature of the bottom. The granite, with the grout, which cements it, and constitutes the road, soon gets pulverized, and the roads become covered in dry weather with a dust composed of a mixture of this powder, straw, dung, and house refuse, which is most prejudicial to health. A shower of rain converts the dust into mud, and the roads, in some places, owing to the absence, of percolation and b 2 4 sufficient surface drainage, become thick with slush, and almost impassable. It is to be wished that, not only in St. Giles, but throughout the metropolis, a better kind of paving may soon be generally adopted. Sewerage. 10. The Sewerage of St. Giles is very complete; not a single street or court being without a sewer, although, of course, all are not equally good. During the past ten years nearly three miles of new sewers have been constructed, thereby eminently promoting the health of the district. A large number of 9-inch pipe house drains have been laid in the same period; but I regret to say that, in Bloomsbury especially, numerous houses have only old brick drains, many of them, in a decayed state. These drains are generally laid over the old cesspools, into which they empty ; and when the cesspool gets filled, the soil overflows into the drain, and thence into the sewer. Nothing can prevent foul and noxious odours in houses where such a mischievous arrangement exists : and I feel persuaded that there would be no objection to the removal of these old drains, and their replacement by good 9-inch pipes, if the occupiers were fully aware of the dangerous elements of fever existing under the basements of their houses. Water Supply. 11. There are no wells, as far as I can ascertain, in use in the District. There are, however, a few underground tanks for the storage of water. These are generally built of brick, and are commonly placed in or near stables. The water they contain is not used for drinking purposes. The New River Company1 s Supply. 12. Our supply of water is derived from the New Biver. Considerable pains are taken by the Company to render it pure; and it stands high, —in fact, second to the Kent Company's water, in general excellence. I subjoin a Tabular Statement of the composition of the London "Waters, from Dr. Frankland's Report, published in the Registrar General's Annual Summary, for the year 1872. It will be observed, that the New River water contains only a minute quantity of organic elements, which are the most deleterious ingredients of water for drinking. 13.—TABLE No. 1.—Composition of Water supplied by the London Companies.

The Company's water, as delivered from the mains, is a species of nectar when compared with the liquid actually drank by many of our poorer people. This liquid is frequently a solution of dropped leaves, bits of 5 plaster, old boots, and various kinds of rubbish, found at the bottom of the butts from which the water is drawn. I have often found animalculæ in the water. The new Water Act will, if fairly carried out, put an end to this evil, by establishing a constant supply. The arrangements under this Act, as now proposed, are too complicated and expensive for poor neighbourhoods, and have rather, for their object, the protection of the Companies, than the advantage of the poor, in whose behalf the Act was ostensibly passed. The division of the area of supply into smaller groups of houses, each group with its own reservoir, provided with a guage to show the height of the water at all times, would enable the Companies to control the supply, so that there should be no undue waste of water, and to detect it at once, wherever it occurred ; it would also facilitate operations for the extinction of fires, and would be cheaper in the end, both for the Companies and the public. The present system is inapplicable to existing requirements. The supply has grown beyond the organization. It is not improbable that the end of the long agitation on the combined subjects of water and gas, will be the placing of the distribution of these necessaries of town life in the hands of a municipal authority. The Gas supply. 15. The Imperial Company supplies the gas for this District. The purity of gas is an important sanitary requirement; for there are many painful maladies that are distinctly traceable to our modern methods of consuming coal gas. The sulphur contained in gas, if not actually causing serious diseases of a permanent nature, unquestionably produces pulmonary and cerebral symptoms of a distressing character, and it is highly desirable that this impurity should be as much as possible eliminated. The Imperial Company's gas is not often deficient in illuminating power, and it evidences but a small quantity of ammonia; but I regret to say that it contains a large quantity of sulphur. For example, according to Dr. Letheby's last Report, it appears, that whilst the average amount of sulphur at the several stations of the Chartered Company was 13.6 grains per hundred cubic feet, that of the Imperial Company was 31. per cent. The South Metropolitan Company's gas indeed exceeded this proportion, viz. 36.11 per cent. It is satisfactory to know that, after the 30th of June next, the Gas Inspectors will require that the maximum amount of sulphur in gas shall not be more than 20 grains per hundred cubic feet. The Houses in St. Giles District. 16. The number of houses in the District was, according to the census of 1861, 4690, and according to the census of 1871, 4541. Of the latter number there were 2010 in Bloomsbury, 1209 in St. Giles South, and 1322 in St. Giles North. In the ten years there has been an increase of 20 in Bloomsbury, and a decrease of 134 in St. Giles South, and of 35 in St. Giles North. (See Report for 1871.) 17. This slight reduction of the house accommodation has been caused chiefly by the conversion of dwelling-houses into warehouses—a process that is likely to go on with increasing rapidity every coming year. In illustration, 1 may point out that Barley Court, which was demolished two years ago, is now partly occupied by a warehouse. The larger portion of Newton Street has been recently pulled down, and warehouses are already in course of erection upon the site. So with other places. As the trade of London continues to increase, so St. Giles, which lies close to the great centres of business, must be expected to be occupied more and more with warehouses, and less and less with the miserable dwelling-houses which have hitherto sheltered its poor population. It requires no foresight to predict that, if London continues to be as prosperous in the future as in the past, a considerable transformation in this respect in St. Giles will take place in the course of another ten years. As the leases of the bad property fall in, warehouses will rise in all available situations. 6 The Dials. 18. The most important portion of the sub-district of St. Giles South was built upon an erroneous plan—that of Dials, characterized by seven or eight lines of streets, running at a very acute angle, from a common or Dial centre. This ground plan, which looks pretty upon paper, is perplexing to a stranger, who finds it difficult to discover his whereabout. Sanitarily, it is exceedingly bad, for as all the lines of such streets converge to a point, there are always, at the end of the wedge, from five to ten houses which have no back yards; and, as a necessity, the water-closets, dust-bins, &c.. must be placed in the cellars. The staircases are dark and badly ventilated. Most of the houses contain about eight rooms, but some are smaller, and they are generally let out in tenements, one family occupying a single room. The streets are, for the greater part, narrow, and are intersected by narrower alleys. 19. Great Wild Street. The streets and courts about Great "Wild Street, particularly those on the west side, are not only built very close together, with small yards, but are usually approached by a narrow passage under a house at either end. On the east side they are not much better. Dr. Buchanan computed that there were upwards of seventy streets, courts, and alleys, in the District, that either had no thoroughfare, or were approached under a covered way. Proper ventilation under such circumstances is impossible. Nothing but a clean sweep of all the property, and rebuilding on a better plan, will ever make this part of St Giles a healthy quarter The Mews in Bloomsbury. 20. The houses in Bloomsbury, and in that portion of St. Giles north of New Oxford Street, are generally of a superior class. They are provided with Mews in the rear, but the stables are, as a rule, no longer held by the occupiers of the houses in front, but are let to livery stable keepers and cab owners. They are not therefore, in many instances, kept in that clean and wholesome state which is necessary to maintain the health of the people living over them, and many of them are in bad repair. This is a source of sickness, and is one principal cause of the steadily increasing death-rate of Bloomsbury. Inspector Dixon has given much attention to these Mews during the past year, and has caused repairs and sanitary improvements to be carried out in a large number. 21. Besides the houses inhabited by independent persons, tradesmen, and respectable artizans, there are many of a lower class, occupied by costermongers, match, flower and fruit sellers, who make St. Giles their head quarters for a large section of London. Irish labourers too abound among us, and probably form half of the population of St. Giles South. Common Lodging Houses. 22. Below these again are the tramps, wifedeserters, beggars, pick-pockets, and women of bad repute, who occupy the common lodging houses in this quarter. There are more than 2000 of these persons, the large majority of whom are single, or at least live as celibates ; they are, nevertheless, prolific. 23. A considerable amount of the sickness and mortality in St. Giles, and a large proportion of the cost for supporting its pauperism, are caused by the occupants of these houses. These lodging-houses are, moreover, the seething hotbeds of depravity and crime, and, being adjacent to the habitations of the lowest class of our labouring poor, the indecent and immoral habits of the population, infect whole streets, and cast a gloomy shadow of squalor and vice over the entire locality. It would be a mercy to the labouring poor to scatter these people from their haunts. Only a limited number of houses harbouring them should be allowed in each district. By massing these outcasts together, as they are in St. Giles, they are effectually cut off from all humanizing influences, and their moral corruption only becomes more aggravated. 24. The regulations instituted by the Police authorities for the management of these houses are, in most respects, satisfactory, and they are carried out with considerable stringency; but the amount of cubic space allotted to person is much too small. 7 TABLE No. II.

The necessity and mode of providing healthier Somes for the Working Classes. 26. It would occupy too much space in this Report to enter upon the great question of the mode that should be preferred for providing, healthy dwellings for the labouring classes,—a question that is more immediately pressing in St. Giles than in any other District of London. I am not without hope, however, that at no distant time this question will be brought nearer to a solution, and that our civilization will be relieved of a stigma which has been too long allowed to deface it. "We are, I am happy to say, gradually becoming cleaner and healthier in this District, as our death registers attest; but an immense work remains to be done. 27. There are large sums ot money now waiting to be employed in undertakings of this nature: the Peabody trustees alone hold more than £600,000, about two-thirds of which remain idle, in consequence of the impossibility of obtaining sites. I do not conceive, however, that private enterprise can do the work in an adequate manner, without the direction and stimulus of a Central Board, having Parliamentary power to raise money and purchase property for the purpose. The Occupation of " Underground Rooms." 28. St Giles has been long notorious for its " underground rooms," which have caused us considerable opprobrium. Very great exertions have been recently made to prohibit the use, as sleeping rooms, of all such rooms as have been occupied contrary to law. In November last, Mr. Hayward, the District Surveyor, made an inspection of these rooms, as directed by the Metropolitan Local Management Act, and he returned 170 underground rooms as being illegally occupied. As soon as his Report could be obtained, the necessary steps were taken to require the fulfilment of the law; and I am pleased to be able to say that, at this moment, there is not, to my knowledge, a single underground room illegally occupied in the District. That evasions of our supervision, by unworthy persons, will occasionally take place, I have no doubt; but they must be dealt with as they occur. This useful work has been done without inflicting undue hardship on individuals, and in not more than two or three instances have complaints been made to me of a too rigorous interpretation of the statute. The truth is, the public are undergoing a training in sanitary matters, and are becoming, every year, more sensible of the necessity of our regulations being enforced. The Population of St. Giles District. 29. The population of the District amounted in 1861 to 54,076, and in 1871 to 53,429. Of the latter number there were in Bloomsbury 17,843, in St. Giles South 19,089, and in St. Giles North 16,497, being an increase of 451 in Bloomsbury, and a decrease of 394 in St. Giles South, and of 704 in St. Giles North. 30. The decennial decrease per cent. was from 1841.51 at the rate of 0.1; from 1851-61 at the rate of 0.3 ; and from 1861-71 at the rate of 1.0. The Excess of Births. 31. The excess of registered births over registered deaths in the ten years was, in Bloomsbury 1,021, in St. Giles South 1,377, and in St. Giles North 1,244—total 3,642. This statement however requires qualification, in consequence of the births in the British Lying-in-Hospital being counted in the number attributed to St. Giles South; but I am unable to make the exact correction for the entire period. In recent years the excess from this cause has amounted to 150 per annum: subtracting, therefore, 1500 from the aggregate, we obtain 2142 as the probable excess of births over deaths during the ten years, or 214 per annum. 9 The Immigration into and Emigration from St. Giles District. 32. What becomes of this excess of births ? They are not added to our population, which is actually diminishing. If we consider also that there is an annual immigration into the District, especially of Irish families, it is apparent that a larger loss than 214 persons must bo accounted for. These 214 persons represent the emigration into other districts, either metropolitan or provincial. Many die in hospitals, but these are entered in our Tables, and do not influence the result. The roving population who inhabit our common lodging houses, however the individuals may change, maintains its numbers. There can be no doubt that a considerable portion of the excess consists of Irish families, who wander through the country in search of employment, especially the hop-pickers and hay-makers, and who find other homes better suited for a settlement. (§ 20.) The Rates of Population to Area. 33. The number of population to area, according to the last census, was in the whole district 218 to an acre—or, in Bloomsbury 159, in St. Giles South 303, and in St. Giles North 275. Excluding the open spaces, the actual density of the population to the inhabited area was, for the whole District, 263 persons per acre, for Bloomsbury 203, for St. Giles South 360, and for St. Giles North 295. The Rates of Populaiim to Houses. 34. The number of population to houses was, in the whole District, 11.76—or, inBloomsbury 8.87, in St. Giles South 15.78, and in St. Giles North 12.47. (See Beport 1871, Table No. 1 ) In an excellent Beport presented to you by my predecessor, Dr. Buchanan, for the year 1858, he, basing his calculations upon the census for 1851, stated that, at that time, there were in Bloomsbury 8.4 persons to each house, in St. Giles South 14.3, and in St. Giles North 13.4; so that we conclude that while the density of population in Bloomsbury has not, in the course of fifteen years, increased more than a few decimals, the population in St. Giles North has decreased in the ratio of one person to each house, and the population in St. Giles South has increased in the ratio of 1.4 to each house. 35. The increase of population in St. Giles South has coincided with a decrease of the number of houses; and this increase may be explained partly by the assumption that a large number of the Irish poor, who have been turned out of their houses in the City, Holborn, and the Strand, to make way for extensive public improvements, have located themselves in this District. The presence of the new-comers has forced a considerable number of old residents into other Districts; the process always leaving a residuum behind in St. Giles. Density of the Population. 36. This excessive density of our population is a great evil. By thus analysing its causes and conditions, we are bringing it to a near issue. If we could still further show the cubic space of the rooms of the several houses, we could focus the evil in its intensity. I find, after extensive inquiries in the streets and courts of St. Giles South, that the rooms run from 800 to 1000 cubic feet in size. Such rooms are too small for families. I have been surprised, however, to find but a small number of children in many courts; and, as a matter of fact, our adult population enjoy severally about 400 cubic feet of space in their dwelling rooms. Whenever a family is found to be occupying less space (allowing always two children to count as one adult) steps are taken for its removal. Four hundred cubic feet of space is not enough for health, and we find in the fact of this limited accommodation, a cause—not exclusive, but contributory—of the heavy mortality of this sub-district. 37. The Registrar General states, in his last annual summary, (p. 5) ''It is a well-established law that, other things being equal, the insalubrity of a place increases with the density of the population ; and that the fevers generated in crowded dwellings have a tendency to spread among the whole of the population." 10 The Proportion of Illegitimate to Legitimate Births. 38. With reference to the excessive mortality in the sub-district of St. Giles South, especially among its infant population, it is interesting to notice the proportion of its illegitimate births in relation to those of the other sub-districts. In 1853, the illegitimate births in London were 1 in 24, and in St. Giles District 1 in 16. In the three sub-districts of St. Giles, the proportions were, in Bloomsbury 1 in 50, in St. Giles South 1 in 8, and in St. Giles North 1 in 29. 39. I have been favored by the Officers in the Registrar General's office with the following facts (not yet published) relating to this matter. In the year 1870 there were, in Bloomsbury, 16 illegitimate births, in St. Giles South 70, and in St. Giles North 19. In the year 1871, there were 11 in Bloomsbury, 73 in St. Giles South, and 16 in St. Giles North. Adding the numbers for the two years together, we get severally 27, 143, and 35, which is equivalent, per annum, to 1 illegitimate in 36 births in Bloomsbury, 1 in 8 in St. Giles South, and 1 in 31 in St. Giles North. 40. We thus see that while St. Giles South has, in the course of 20 years, remained stationary in this respect, (and perhaps it could not get worse) and whilst St. Giles North has slightly improved, the morality of Bloomsbury has sadly deteriorated. St. Giles South, it is true, is twice as bad as London, and St. Giles North about twice better, and Bloomsbury a little better still; but Bloomsbury has fallen away from its old high standard in a very remarkable degree. This increasing moral depravity corresponds with the increasing death-rate—together we have a sure indication of the increasing deterioration of a population. As the Workhouse, which is chargeable with many of these illegitimate births, stands in St. Giles South, this sub-district is not responsible for the whole of its illegitimacy. The Proportion Dying in Workhouses and Hospitals. 41. The average number of deaths per annum in hospital, for a period of 10 years, (including all the hospitals usually visited) is 97. If to these be added the average number of deaths among patients under the care of the Physicians and Surgeons of the Bloomsbury Dispensary (102), besides a small number dying in the Lying-in Charity and elsewhere, we get an average aggregate of 200 deaths per annum among persons receiving charitable medical relief. 42. Again, the average number of deaths per annum in the workhouse has been 257, and the average number among out-patients of the workhouse 220—together 477. If we add these numbers together, we obtain an average of 677 deaths per annum of persons who had been receiving parochial or charitable medical relief. 43. The total average of deaths per annum during the 10 years was 1519, consequently more than 44 per cent. of our population died under the care of hospital or parochial medical officers. This statement shows the distressed condition of the mass of our population. Throughout the metropolis, 9 deaths in the 100 occurred in workhouses, and 8 in the 100 in hospitals. Among our people, 7 in the 100 died in hospitals, and 17 in the 100 died in the workhouse. 44. In the face of these facts, it becomes a grave question whether eleemosynary medicine should be encouraged. It most certainly requires regulation. The facility with which even artizans, earning good wages, can obtain medical relief, by simply applying for it, in any and every district of the metropolis, is an incentive to improvidence, by accustoming them to rely upon charity rather than upon their own frugality and forethought, and points to the way, to be followed, with tardy steps it may be, but without much remorse, to the workhouse. 11 The Mortality from certain important Diseases during the Ten Tears, 1863—72. 45. It may be convenient, in the first place, to show the total mortality, and, in connexion with it, the mortality among children under two years of age, from certain special forms of death peculiar to children, e.g., deaths from suffocation, caused by overlying in bed, or other carelessness; from atrophy and convulsions—exchangeable terms for gradual wasting, ending in some convulsive affection—which is usually caused by defects of nursing, foul air, or culpable neglect. Convulsions directly attributable to hydrocephalus are not included, the object being to show the number of deaths occurring among infants from the inattention of parents and nurses. 46. The average number of total registered deaths per annum, (excluding deaths in hospitals) during ten years, was 1431; and of these there was an average number of 500 among children under two years of age, = 35 per cent. of the total mortality. Of the 500 deaths per annum of children, 15.4 occurred from "suffocation," 55. from "atrophy," and 34.2 from "convulsions," which is equivalent to about 21 per cent. Thus, of all the children dying under two years of age in St. Giles District, 1 in 5 died from causes chiefly induced by gross carelessness, abject poverty, or criminal neglect. That this is not an exaggeration will be obvious, on consideration that the deaths from premature birth, tabes mesenterica, teething, diarrhoea, &c., are not included. 47. The following Table exhibits the variations in the mortality in different years, from the diseases cited. These variations are more especially remarkable among the miasmatic order. Thus, there was an excess of deaths from Small Pox in 1863, 1867, and 1871—every four years; from Scarlet Fever in 1870; from Measles in 1865, 1867, and 1869; in these years the deaths from "Whooping Cough were at the lowest (with the exception of the year 1871), thus serving to show that there is not that inter-dependence between Measles and Whooping Cough that has been sometimes imagined. The deaths from Fever were most numerous in 1864 and 5, and from Diarrhoea in 1866. when 49 deaths occurred from Cholera.

Notwithstanding the variations in the mortality from the several miasmatic diseases, there seems to be a general tendency to a decrease of mortality among the members of the order, taken as a whole. In 1863 there were 360 deaths from these diseases; in 1872, only 211—a very large reduction; and, even 12 in 1871, notwithstanding the excessive mortality from Small Pox, there were only 295. In fact, in the first half of the term of ten years, there were 1713 deaths from those diseases; in the last half of the term (including the period of the heaviest mortality recently known from Small Pox and Scarlet Fever) only 1359 deaths, being a clear saving of 354 human lives in five years, and a prevention of 10,000 cases of sickness sufficiently severe to require medical aid. Is it unreasonable or premature to attribute this remarkable improvemant to the gradually increasing strictness of our sanitary inspection? It seems only just to come to this conclusion, after an experience of five years. If it be not possible, at present at any rate, to extinguish the germs of organic poisons, we can at least modify their virulence when they spring into activity. 49. "With reference to other diseases in the Table, we remark a more regular mortality. The deaths from Phthisis have, indeed, been decreasing during the past three years in a slight degree; but the deaths from Bronchitis are not perceptibly reduced. Pneumonia gathered many victims during the first three years of the series; since then it has maintained a tolerably steady mortality. About 14 per cent., or one death in every seven, in St. Giles District, is due to Phthisis; and about 16 per cent., or one death in every six, due to Bronchitis. Pneumonia causes one death in every seventeen. Together, these diseases cause 36 per cent, of the total mortality. Public Institutions in St. Giles District. 50. Those institutions that have a bearing upon the health of the community, and assist more or less directly the sanitary administration, are the "Workhouse, the Bloomsbury Dispensary, the British Lying-in Charity, and the Infants' Home. The first two are almost exclusively confined to relieving poor parishioners, and each supplements the other in so complete a manner, as to justify the opinion that, in this respect, the District is amply provided. The British Lying-in Charity gives additional help to our poor, about 20 women in a year, belonging to this District, receiving aid from its resources. The Infants' Home has less claim upon our favorable consideration. Admitting that the good done by this institution may outweigh its disadvantages, St. Giles scarcely participates in it; whilst, on the contrary, as I have shown this year (§ 106) it adds unduly to our mortality. The Public Baths and Washhouses.—50a. In referring to the public institutions of St. Giles, an important place should be given to the Public Baths and "Washhouses, which are a valuable means of promoting habits of cleanliness and good management among the working classes. The practice, which is still common in the District, of washing at home in a single room, which serves at the same time for living room, kitchen, and bed room, is fraught with evils, as it leads to dirt, disorder, and slovenliness; destroys all the possible comforts of home; drives the husband into the streets; and, in the case of sickness, as often happens, wraps the sufferer in a damp steamy atmosphere, which is very injurious in many diseases. The Baths and "Washhouses in this District have been most successful, so far as the use of them is concerned, and have been highly appreciated by the poor. If they have not yet repaid the capital expended upon them, nor are likely to do it, that is simply owing to the conditions under which they were established by Act of Parliament. They have had, however, the good effect of teaching a better class of persons the value of a personal bath; and at the present time many persons have baths erected at home for private use, who, when the Public Baths were established, resorted to them for their periodical ablution. The Charity Organization Committee.—51. Within a few years a new Society has been founded, and has established a branch in this District, the chief object of which is to limit and regulate charitable relief, and to repress mendicity. As its experience has grown, its operations have enlarged, and it now conducts inquiries into all the more important 13 arrangements of society which have a bearing upon the health and morals of the humbler classes. Among other matters, it is engaged, by means of an influential committee, in devising measures for the improvement of the dwellings of working men,—an object that must command our sympathy, for here, if anywhere, the help of all friends of social advancement is greatly needed. The Elementary Education Act.—52. The passsing of the Elementary Education Act has given a fresh impulse to education. Old schools have been re-organized, and new schools built, and a vigorous emulation presses forward the good cause of public instruction. All these are important aids to our sanitary administration, for ignorance lies at the root of all the physical evils from which we suffer. If plain and practical lectures, on the laws of health and causes of diseases, were given in some of these institutions, to the parents of the children, and the young men and women who could be induced to attend, much good would be done. It is only by diffusing a knowledge of the leading truths of sanitary soience among the persons who are the special victims of a neglect of them, that we can get any secure ground for a belief that the time will come when the mortality of this city will be materially reduced. The Progeess of Improvement during the Ten Years. 53. The progress made in the application of sanitary science to the improvement of the condition of the community, may be estimated from a brief recital of the principal Acts of Parliament that have been passed, and of the work done, during the ten years. 54. In 1862, an amendment of the law gave the Justices power to license Cow-houses. Your Board opposed the granting of licenses, on the ground that they were injurious to health; but the Magistrates declined to abolish them, requiring only that the owners of them should observe your regulations. 55. In 1863, the Officer of Health reported upon the wretched condition of Church Lane, and contiguous Courts, and your Board took active measures to abate the nuisances complained of. In 1871, I gave a certificate to your Board condemning the same property, under Torrens' Act, as unfit for habitation, and steps are now in progress for removing the worst part of the property. In the year 1863, Dr. Buchanan reported also on the unhealthy condition of Coram Place. In 1871, I gave a certificate of its unfitness for habitation: your Board decided that both it and Russell Place should be demolished; and, upon appeal to the Justices, your decision was confirmed. As this was the first, and I believe the only case, in which the Act was tested by an appeal, the resolution of your Board to undertake the responsibility should be acknowledged. 56. In the Session of 1862—3, an Act was passed for the better regulation of Bakehouses. This Act is now carefully carried out in the District. An important decision was also obtained in this year from the Magistrates, at the instance of your Board, viz., that 400 cubic feet of space was essential to the health of every inmate of a house. This decision has worked excellently in behalf of the well-being of the poor. 57. In 1865, Cattle Plague occurred in the Cowhouses; only one-fifth of the usual number were in the sheds at the end of the year. In 1865-6, the legislature amended the Nuisances Removal Act, and passed a Vaccination Act. In 1865, Cholera appeared in the metropolis, and a second Sanitary Inspector was appointed to this District. 58. In 1866, a new "Sanitary Act" was passed, giving larger powers to, and imposing heavier duties upon, Local Boards. It contained provisions, among other matters, for disinfection, the use of ambulances, the removal to 14 hospital of patients afflicted with contagious disease, the establishment of district hospitals, post mortem houses, and mortuaries. In compliance with this Act, your Board has built a disinfecting chamber. A Mortuary has also been provided by favor of the Rector of Bloomsbury. In this year, the District was visited by Epidemic Cholera, and much additional duty and responsibility ensued. 59. In 1867, an attempt was made to carry out a system of "House Registration," in conformity with the "Sanitary Act of 1866," but much resistance was offered, and the Regulations were recalled, it being understood that they should be applied thenceforward only to special cases. Since then, on a hearing before the Magistrates, legal objections were discovered, which have practically made the Regulations inexpedient. The Workshop Regulation Act passed this year. 60. In 1868, The Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act was carried through the Legislature, by Mr. Torrens. This is likely to prove a most useful measure. It enables Local Boards to require the amendment or demolition of houses certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be unfit for human habitation. This year, a decision by Mr. Vaughan", granting a conviction on a summons by your Board, against an occupier of an underground room, has strengthened the hands of the Board in dealing with this evil. 61. In 1869, there was no special legislation. This was the first year of my duties. The epidemic of Relapsing Eever began. 62. In 1870, the Disinfecting Chamber was erected. Regulations for the better management of Rag and Bone Shops were issued. Houses in Abbey Place condemned. Relapsing Eever prevailed extensively, and largely increased the duties of the Inspectors. 63. In 1871, the epidemic of Small Pox occurred. Church Lane, with its adjacent courts, and Coram Place and Russell Place, certified to be unfit for human habitation, and the two latter demolished. Princes Court certified to be uninhabitable, and it, together with Barley Court, pulled down by the intervention of the District Surveyor. The Eactory and Workshop Act amended. The Yaccination Act amended. The Metropolis Water Act passed, the main object of which is to provide for a constant supply. Nearly two years have elapsed, and nothing effectual has been done in this District. This barren result is owing to the absence from the Act of any stringent provisions, making it obligatory on the Metropolitan Board and the Companies to carry it out. I pointed out this defect in the Act in my Report to you, soon after it had passed the Legislature, and it is not improbable that an amended Act will be necessary. At the same time, the expense of the fittings required is a prohibition upon the application of the Act to poor districts. 64. In 1872, the Legislature passed a new "Public Health Act," having for its object the organization of a sanitary system in the provinces; also "An Act for Regulating the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors," and containing clauses for the prevention of adulteration; the execution of which does not rest with the District Boards. Also "An Act for the prevention of Adulteration of Eood, Drink and Drugs," one of its chief purposes being to secure the appointment of Analysts, having competent medical, chemical, and microscopical knowledge. Dr. Redwood, the well-known Pharmaceutical Chemist, has been appointed for this District. 65. This Act is capable of being made most valuable in the detection of the causes of disease; and it is to be hoped that this use of it will not be lost sight of. Many diseases arise from the food or drink taken: the special causes of some of these are already well known; but the direct causes of others remain in obscurity. Scurvy, gout, enteric fever, trichiniasis, variou 15 fatal diseases of the liver, kidneys, and other organs, are directly caused by certain kinds of food and drink. Many other diseases, the causes of which are unknown, are, in all probability, induced by kinds of aliment, adulterated or not, whose action upon the system remains to be ascertained. This Act may be turned to the most important use, in detecting these obscure causes of disease, and a great benefit might be thus conferred on science and humanity. Sanitary Inspection. 66. The large increase of work done by the Inspectors, in consequence of the various duties imposed by the Legislature, and the growing opinion of the importance of the office, will be best understood by a perusal of the subjoined tabular statement. TABLE No. 4. Year, Houses Improved. Total Improvements.

In addition to the foregoing duties of inspection, &c., a considerable quantity of bad food has been seized, which has entailed much trouble and responsibility on the officers. 16 THE GENERAL MORTALITY FOR THE YEAR 1872. 67. The year 1872 was a peculiarly healthy one, and the mortality was exceptionally low,—at the rate of 21.4 per 1000 persons living. The Registrar General informs us that "Diarrhoea was the prevalent fatal zymotic disease in London, and raised the summer mortality;" then followed, in succession, whooping-cough, small-pox, measles, and fever. 68. The temperature was mild throughout the year, and during the last quarter there was an excessive rain-fall. What influence this may have had in diminishing the number of deaths from zymotic diseases is very doubtful. It must be remembered, that during the period that relapsing fever prevailed in St. Giles, there was also an excess of rain, to which there was reason to believe that the fever was in some way attributable. Until the true or specific cause of the several fevers be known, the influence of general causes must remain disputable. The Registrar General points out that "the mortality had two maxima in the cold second week of January, and in the hot first week of August"; and, he observes, "thus the winter and summer diseases prevail most respectively in the coldest and hottest weather; and then their decline reduces the mortality to a minimum." This is corroborative of past experience. 69. The annual Birth Rate in London was 35.4 per 1000 persons living. The Birth Rate for St. Giles was only 29.9. The Birth Rate in St. Giles District. 70. The total number of registered births in St, Giles District, during the year, was 1774, but various corrections are necessary, in order to bring the official register in accordance with the actual number of births occurring among our population. In the first place, there were 193 births in the Lying-in Hospital, of which only 20 belonged to our District, as ascertained from the previous residences of the mothers. Of the 20 so belonging to us. 8 must be appropriated to St. Giles North, and 2 to St. George, Bloomsbury. The excess of 173 births must of course be subtracted from our total number, and also particularly from the number for St. Giles South, in which sub-district the Hospital stands. The numbers belonging to the subdistricts must also be properly allocated. 71. Again, 108 births occurred in the Workhouse, all of which are entered against St. Giles South; but if we appropriate them to the subdistricts, in accordance with the reputed residences of the mothers on admission, 26 must be added to the register for St. Giles North, and 14 added to the register for St. George, Bloomsbury. The aggregate 40 must be subtracted from the number of St. Giles South. There were also five births in the Workhouse, five in which the addresses of the mothers were unknown, and two from outside parishes. I leave the latter where I found them in the register for St. Giles South. 72. These corrections having been made, the actual births amounted to 1601; and of this number, 460 belonged to St. George, Bloomsbury; 594 to St. Giles South: and 547 to St. Giles North. TABLE No. 5.—The Birth-rate to Population in St. Giles and its Sub-districts. Sub-Districts Population. Births. Ratio of Births to Population. Rate per 1000. St. George Bloomsbury 17,843 460 1 in 38.8 25.7 St. Giles South 19,089 594 1 in 32.1 31.1 16,497 547 l in 30.1 33.1 53,429 1601 1 in 33.3 29.9 17 This is an exceedingly low birth-rate, and was caused principally by the deficiency in St. George, Bloomsbury. The Death Rate in St. Giles District. 73. The number of registered deaths in the District was 1190, of which 321 are attributed to Bloomsbury, 565 to St. Giles South, and 204 to St. Giles North. It is necessary, however, to amend these figures, in order to obtain a correct statement. I have been in the habit of inspecting the admission books of the various metropolitan hospitals which are most commonly the resort of our poor people in sickness, and extracting from them the deaths of persons who are entered as coming from one of our parishes. This is not done, as I am informed, by other Officers of Health ; and as the numbers so ascertained are added to our local register, the effect is to place our death-rate at a disadvantage, in comparison with other Districts. We obtain in this way, however, a more exact account. I beg to express my obligations to the Medical Officers and Secretaries of the several Hospitals for their courtesy in allowing me to inspect the books. 74. In the year 1872, one death occurred in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 16 in University College, 5 in the Royal Free, 12 in the Middlesex, 20 in King's College, 16 in Charing Cross, and 2 in the Children's Hospital. One, of which the cause is entered as "unknown," is also reported. There were no deaths in the Westminster Hospital. In all there were 73. These are added to the registered deaths in the General Table No. 4 in the Appendix. 75. There were also, in addition to these, 27 deaths in the Highgate Infirmary, 4 in the Homerton Infirmary, and one in the Stockwell Infirmary = 32. These have not been added to the various summaries, nor to the numbers in the General Table in the Appendix; but they are taken into account here, so that nothing may be omitted from this abstract. They properly belong to the record of the Deaths in the Workhouse, to which I shall add them. 76. The registered deaths in the Workhouse were 181, to which the 32 above-mentioned being added, an aggregate of 213 is obtained. These deaths must be distributed among the three sub-districts, according to custom. Of the entire number, 12 were ascertained to belong to Bloomsbury, 59 to St. Giles South, 39 to St. Giles North, and 94 to the Workhouse, including the Highgate, Homerton, and Stockwell deaths. Besides these 5 were tramps, 2 were not identified, 1 was an outsider, and 1 was unknown. These (9) will be omitted. The deaths in the British Lying-in Hospital (9) and in the Infants' Home (16), not belonging to us, must also be deducted. The following Table represents the results. TABLE No. 6.—The Death-rate to Population in St. Giles and its Sub-district. Sub-Districts. Population. Deaths. Ratio of Deaths to Population Rate per 1000. St. George Bloomsbury 17,843 351 1 in 50.8 19.67 St. Giles South 19,089 466 1 in 41.0 24.41 St. Giles North 16,497 359 1 in 46.0 21.15 Workhouse ... 94 ... ... Whole District 53,429 1,270 1 in 42.0 23.77 77. This death-rate is remarkably low for St. Giles District—less in fact by 4.48 than the average of the preceding 10 years, and less absolutely than has ever been recorded. It is however much greater than the deathrate per 1000, for London (21.4), and indicates the prevalence of noxious conditions throughout the most populous portionof the District, which we c 1 18 should never tire in endeavouring to remove. It is fair, however, to say that, whilst in the whole of London the mortality in two of the ten years was nearly as low as last year (70,893) viz., in 1863 (71,060) and in 1867 (70,924), in St. Giles the registered death-rate was never lower than 1345, except last year, when it was 1269. The past two years, therefore, have manifested a most remarkable and steady improvement. 78. Again, whilst the average death-rate of London for the ten years was 24.3, and the death-rate for 1872, 21.4—a diminution of 2.9 per 1000 —the average death-rate for St. Giles District for the same period was 28.25, and the death-rate for 1872 (including all hospital deaths), 23.77— a diminution of 4.48 per 1000. This is a hopeful state of things, and should give us encouragement to persevere in our work. The Death Bate among Infants in St. Giles. 79. The causes that dispose to premature death operate more powerfully on the delicate organizations of infants than on persons of maturer strength. Children are, moreover, liable to a variety of noxious and enervating influences, from which older persons are exempt. Being unable to take care of themselves, they are entirely at the mercy of their mothers and nurses; and should this solemn charge be neglected, they are doomed to perish prematurely of various diseases which might have been easily averted. The mortality of children becomes consequently a criterion of the domestic pollutions of a district, and of the poverty and intemperance of its inhabitants. Moral as well as physical causes share in the production of this mortality. 80. The mean mortality of children under one year of age was, in London, for the year 1872, 15.9 per cent. of all the children born. This is a standard by which we shall presently be able to judge of the condition of St. Giles District. 81. I find that we lost last year 332* infants under one year of age, a larger number than in the preceding year (319), but exactly the same number as in the year 1870. Of this number, 89 deaths occurred in St. George, Bloomsbury, 130 in St. Giles South, and 113 in St. Giles North. 82. The following Table represents the results:— Whole District 1 death in every 4.8 births = 20.08 per cent. St. George, Bloomsbury, 1 5.2 =19.2 St. Giles South 1 4.6 =21.7 St. Giles North 1 4.8 =20.08 83. It is apparent that in each of our sub-districts there was a considerable excess over the mean mortality of the metropolis just cited (§ 80). The mortality of the whole District was, in fact, one-fourth greater,— a lamentable evidence of the low social condition of a large section of our District. As regards the sub-districts, St. George, Bloomsbury, and St. Giles North, had a higher mortality than usual (though a lower birth-rate), and St. Giles South a lower mortality. 84. With respect to the proportion of deaths among infants to population, it was in the whole District 1 in 160.9 persons living; in Bloomsbury 1 in 200; in St. Giles South 1 in 146.9; and in St. Giles North 1 in 146. The Death Bate among Peesons 60 Years of Age and upwards. 85. In the year 1872, 255 persons at the ages named died in the District, which is at the rate of 1 in every 209 persons living, or 4.78 per 1000, which is considerably lower than last year (5.6 per 1000). * It should be borne in mind, however, that of the deaths enumerated for Bloomsbury, 16 occurred in the Infants' Home, and did not belong to our District. Subtracting these our aggregate would be reduced to 316, and the number allotted to Bloomsbury to 73. 19 The Death Rate among Persons at all Ages. (Excluding Infants and Persons 60 years of age and upwards.) 86. Six hundred and eighty three persons died at these ages, which is in the proportion of 1 in every 78.2 of our population, a less proportion than last year (1 in 71.5), or than the year before (1 in 62). 87. Now the last year referred to, viz. 1870, although characterized by the prevalence of two contagious diseases, did not exhibit a high rate of mortality, viz., 27.3, against an average of 28.19 for ten previous years, yet our mortality in 1872 was so extraordinarily low, as to favor us with a saving of human life at the most active ages of 28 per cent. of the deaths at those ages. 88. The subjoined Table shows the mortality of St. Giles in the several classes and orders in comparison with the metropolis. The deaths that occurred in the Infants' Home are included here. The comparison is favorable to us in the class of "Zymotic" diseases, and against us in all the other classes, but particularly the "Local." Expressed in per centages, there was 12 per cent. to our advantage in the Zymotic diseases, 8 per cent. to our disadvantage among the Constitntional, 20 per cent. to our disadvantage among the Local, and 8 per cent. to our disadvantage among the Developmental. {Vide next page.) Low Death-rate among Zymotic diseases. 89. The general inference to be drawn from these Tables seems to be this, that it is exceedingly difficult to reduce the death-rate at certain ages and among certain classes of disease. We had, for example, a lower death-rate last year than was perhaps ever known in St. Giles; yet the only class in which the death-rate was decidedly lowered, below the metropolitan rate, was the Zymotic. (§ 48.) Here, theu, we may fairly take credit for the efforts we have made to extinguish, if that be possible, the causes of the febrile or catching diseases. The mortality in London was low, but ours was lower still; and it would be an indulgence in a timid scepticism not to assume credit where it seems reasonably due. It is this class of diseases which is most peculiarly within the reach of sanitary precautions, and we certainly seem to have controlled them. Local Diseases. 90. The deaths from the "Local" diseases were in considerable excess of the Metropolitan rate, but nevertheless much below our ordinary number. These diseases are represented especially by affections of the respiratory organs, more particularly bronchitis. This disease is, in fact, the scourge of St. Giles. Our old people perish of it after lingering sickness in the workhouse, and in the miserable courts of the south sub-district; and our young children are cut off by it, prematurely, after acute attacks supervening on enfeebled constitutions. Bronchitis, indeed, was not so rife as usual, but it was above our quota; we may therefore conclude that the mild temperature favored patients liable to this affection in St. Giles, in common with the metropolis at large; but that there are local and personal causes in St. Giles that prevail in maintaining an excessive death-rate from this disease, even under the most favorable climatic conditions. Diseases among Children. 91. The deaths among children also were as numerous as in more unhealthy years. Children seem, in truth, to have received no advantage, either from the beneficence of Nature or our sanitary interposition. There are causes in operation which we cannot at present reach. Shall we ever be able to do so? We cannot answer in the negative, until an effort has been made to provide the poor with better ventilated and wholesome dwellings than those in which they now sicken and perish. It is true that the lower class of poor are improvident, intemperate, and reckless of their health ; and until their moral nature shall be improved, and their intelligence better cultivated, they will be liable to the penalties inflicted by their own folly. But, on the other hand, neither men nor c 2 20 TABLE 7. Comparison of Mortality from Various Causes in London and St. Giles, Whole Year, 1872, (52 Weeks.) Classes. Classes and Orders of Disease.

The children then, instead of dying with an almost predestined regularity, will be better cared for, and will participate with their parents in a happier prospect of life.

These have amounted to 238 (the deaths in hospital inclusive), a remarkably small number for this District. The proportions were—72 Bloomsbury, 108 St. Giles South, 58 St. Giles North. Small Pox. 94. We sustained 8 deaths from this malady, which is less than our average number. Scarlatina 95. caused only 5 deaths, all in Bloomsbury. Last year we had 20, in 1870, 102, and in 1869, 48. Fevers. 96. Only 9 deaths resulted from the three forms of fever. In previous years we had 26, 31, and 37. Whooping Cough. 97. This disease is usually very fatal in this District. In 1872, we numbered 42 deaths. In preceding years we had 38, 16, and 83. We sustained, therefore, last year about an average mortality; and this may be accounted for by the presumption that the contagium in this affection differs in its nature from that, or those, causing the miasmatic diseases. Deaths from whooping-cough are commonly caused by intercurrent complications, e. g., bronchitis. Diarrhoea. 98. Seventy-one deaths occurred from diarrhoea, and of this number 52 were in the autumnal quarter. St. Giles South had the largest proportion of deaths (30); 53 deaths occurred under one year of age, and ten more between one and five years; the remaining eight were among aged people. As usual, it is the mismanaged and neglected infant that perishes from this fatal disease. Inquest cases. 99. There were 86 inquest cases during the year: 13 of these were held on bodies of persons belonging to Bloomsbury, 51 to St. Giles South, and 22 to St. Giles North. 20 occurred in the first quarter, 23 in the second, 19 in the third, and 24 in the last. The large majority of the deaths were from natural disease. Some of the causes of death require especial notice. For example, 18 infants are returned as 22 having died from suffocation or convulsions. In two other deaths of infants, verdicts of wilful murder were returned. Non-certified cases. 100. In 18 cases the registration was effected without a certificate from a qualified medical practitioner, and 11 of these were cases either (as alleged) of debility, convulsions, or premature birth. All these cases should have been certified by a public medical officer, after due investigation, even although an inquest might not have been held. Under a proper system, no corpse should be interred without a certificate of the cause of death from a competent medical practitioner. When a certificate was given by the attending practitioner that should suffice, unless suspicion subsequently arose of criminal treatment; when otherwise, a medical practitioner should be required to make the necessary investigation, and to decide whether an inquest was necessary or not, instead of such an important matter being left, as now, to the uneducated intelligence of a Coroner's Beadle. A better system would diminish the number and cost of inquests very considerably. Eight deaths were certified as "unknown" These occurred in the workhouse. The Mortality in the Sub-Districts for Ten Years. 101. The diminished death-rate for 1872, in comparison with previous years, is exhibited in the subjoined Table. The figures are very remarkable. It must be remembered, however, that all London enjoyed a low death-rate last year, and it is to be hoped that some other districts can show as favorable a death-register as ourselves. The ratio of advantage to St. Giles, in relation to the metropolis at large, I have already set forth. (§ 88.)

There were 94 deaths in the Workhouse that could not be allocated to either of the sub-districts. These are taken into account in estimating the death-rate for the whole District. ( Vide Table No. 6.) The Mortality in the Workhouse and other Local Institutions. 102. During the year 1872 there were 108 births in the workhouse: the deaths were 189; but, including the deaths in the Highgate, Hampstead, and Stockwell Infirmaries, there were 213. This is less than an average number. I have already distributed these deaths among the three sub-districts (§§ 75-6), so that it is unnecessary to repeat the statement here. The Bloomsbury Dispensary. 103. As might be expected, there has been a smaller number of patients at this Dispensary than usual. The heaviest quarter was the first, the lightest the last. The following Table shows the facts. 23 TABLE No. 10.—New cases treated at the Bloomsbury Dispensary, 1872. Quarter ending- Physicians' Cases. Surgeons' Cases. Casualties about Total.

There have been 193 births in this Hospital during the year, of which 96 were males, and 97 females. Three of the mothers died, one from flooding after induced labour at 7 months, one from secondary hœmorrhage, and one from septicœmia after hœmorrhage. Seven of the children died, of whom 3 were males, and 4 females. There were eight children still-born, 4 males and 4 females. 105. Of the 193 births, only 20 belonged to St. Giles District. These should be distributed among the sub-districts, as follows:—10 to St. Giles South, 8 to St. Giles North, and 2 to St. George, Bloomsbury. None of the mothers who died belonged to St. Giles: of the children who died, two belonged to St. Giles South, one a male, the other a female. The Infants Some. 106. The number of children received by this institution during the year was 138. Not more than 10 or 12 are stated to be kept in the Home at one time; and all are eventually sent out to be nursed, on a system already explained in previous Reports. Only one of the children belonged to St. Giles District, and that came from the workhouse. Among the whole number, there were 16 deaths. I regret to be obliged to state that these 16 deaths are registered in St. Giles District, although they do not belong to us, but come from various metropolitan parishes. The method now pursued by the Managers of the Home is, first, to receive the children into the Home ; then, with a view to prevent sickness, to send them to be nursed by women, at Barnet or other suburban districts; but should the children fall ill there, and appear likely to die, they are brought back to St. Giles, where, should they die, they are registered. Not suspecting this system to be in operation, I did not become acquainted with the facts until it was too late to correct my Tables. These 16 deaths have therefore disordered my calculations to some extent; they are, however, taken into account in the first Table of Deaths. It is not proper that these children, when they fall seriously ill, should be brought back from the suburban parishes to die in St. Giles, and I hope the practice will be changed. The Sanitary Work op the Year 1872—73. 107. Although, as we have seen, the sickness and mortality of St. Giles District have been much less than in previous years, yet the actual inspection has considerably increased. In the absence of a serious epidemic, the attention of the Inspectors has not been distracted by a variety of urgent occupations of an incidental nature; and they have had more time to give to the execution of the routine duties of house inspection, the strict fulfilment of which constitutes the best safeguard against the attacks of epidemic disease. This is, in fact, the most important duty of Sanitary Inspectors; inasmuch as it is better to prevent disease than to modify its severity when it has unfortunately come. 24 108. The following Table exhibits the amount of work done. TABLE 11.

In addition to the visits enumerated in the foregoing Table, the Inspectors accompanied Mr. Hayward, the District Surveyor, in his inspection of the underground rooms in the District. The duties of the Inspectors have been well discharged, and the sanitary condition of the District has consequently much improved. The Disinfecting Chamber. 110. The apparatus for disinfection has been little in use this year, which is a subject for congratulation. TABLE No. 12.—List of Articles Disinfected in the Hot Air Chamber during the Year 1872.

Only one body was removed to the Mortuary during the year. Rag and Bone Shops. 112. These have been frequently visited, and the Inspectors report that they find no difficulty in carrying out the Regulations. The owners are willing to do all that is practicable in keeping their shops clean and wholesome; and they are certainly in a much improved condition. Cow Sheds. 113. These have been kept in as fair condition as can be expected, from the structure of the various sheds. Slaughter Houses. 114. The amount of slaughtering in the District has much diminished, Some butchers retain the license without using the slaughter-house. In the Kenton Street slaughterhouse, for example, nothing has been killed this year. Whilst this Report is in hand, a Special Committee of the House of Commons is engaged in considering a Bill brought into the House of Commons by Dr. Brewer, for repealing the 55th and following sections of the Metropolitan Buildings Act, 1844, by virtue of which private slaughtering will be interdicted in London next year. It is to be hoped that the Special Committee will report decisively against the Bill, and will recommend that public abattoirs be provided. I have already reported at length to your Board upon this important subject, and will not prolong this Report by recapitulating the arguments then submitted. It would be most desirable if the powers of the Act above referred to could be applied to the abolition of ill-kept Cowhouses also. This is a subject that will have to be considered when the time arrives. Condemned Houses. 115. My last Annual Report contained a statement of the fact that the houses in Coram Place and Russell Place, Little Coram Street, had been certified to be unfit for human habitation. Your Board therefore took the necessary measures for their demolition. One of the owners, appealed against your decision, and his appeal was heard before the Justices, at the Westminster Guildhall, on the 24th July. The Justices confirmed the order of your Board, and all the houses have been since pulled down. This was the first appeal that had been heard under the "Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868," and the result shows that the Act may be successfully worked in the metropolis. The measures for giving effect to the same Act, in relation to the houses in Church Lane, are still in progress. Underground Rooms. 116. There has been a large clearance of underground rooms and cellars, illegally occupied, during the year; and at the time of writing this Report there are none so occupied, except in the case of a small number, in which there is some doubt as to the violation of the Act of Parliament. Summonses were taken out in the month of January against two landlords, for re-letting their underground rooms after they had been vacated, and I am pleased to say that one of them was fined £l 16s., as a persistent offender, and the other 8s. Houses unfit for Occupation. 117. Proceedings were also taken under the 13th section of the Diseases Prevention and Nuisances Removal Act, 1855, against the occupier of the house No. 20, Great Wild Street, which was in an exceedingly dirty and dilapidated condition, with the view of prohibiting the occupation of the house. Mr. Flowers issued an order of prohibition, and, after some delay, the occupier left the house, but kept the door locked. The order to enter upon the premises was then sought, as the Act directs, but Mr. Flowers was of opinion that he could not make such an order, as the Act gave no power 26 to break open a door: and the occupier could not be fined, as he had complied with the order of prohibition, by leaving the premises. Ultimately, the landlord, in order to get possession, gave the offender thirty shillings, and restored to him his goods, which had been distrained upon to the value of about £15, the landlord losing, besides the rent, nearly £75, and being under an obligation to do the repairs, amounting to about £15. This case adds another to the many difficulties of working the Sanitary Acts. Bakehouses. 118. No complaint has been made of these; and they have been kept in good order. Bad Food. 119. The following is a list of the articles seized and destroyed during the year. TABLE No. 13 —List of Articles Seized in 1872. inspector dixon. inspector harnack. Weight.

New sewers have been built in Hart Street, Bury Place, Woburn Mews West, Short's Gardens, and Stacey Street. After a careful study of the facts stated in the foregoing pages, we cannot but feel satisfaction with the improved sanitary condition of our District, not only as regards the past year, when the improvement was common to the whole of London, but also for the considerable period of five years. It shall be my ambition and effort to maintain this gratifying state of progress. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, GEORGE ROSS, M. D., Medical Officer of Health. APPENDIX.
