To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I beg to present an Annual Report on the health of the district for the year ending the 31st December, 1945. It is compiled in accordance with Circular 28 (1946) of the Ministry of Health and does not include matters connected with the Civil Defence Services. STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE AREA. Area (acres) 770 Population (Census, 1931) 27,771 Civilian Population mid-year 1945 (estimated by Registrar-General) 18,720 Rateable value £192,610 Sum represented by Id. rate £665 The Manager of the Employment Exchange informed me that there were approximately 50 persons unemployed in the Penge Urban District at the end of the year, compared with 3 in 1944. In almost every case, the unemployment was limited to not more than two weeks. The Out-door relief given during the year amounted to £ 10,311 of which £36 was to able-bodied unemployed and their families and the balance to the unemployable from age or other causes. This compares with an amount of £10,916 of which £164 was to able-bodied unemployed and their families in the year 1944. VITAL STATISTICS. Birth Rate per 1,000 of estimated Civilian population, 22.48 Still-Birth Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births, 41.00 Crude Death Rate per 1,000 of the estimated Civilian population, 12.44 Deaths from Puerperal Causes :—Rate per 1,000 total (live and still births) —Nil. Death Rate of Infants Under One Year of Age : All infants, per 1,000 live births 40.38 Legitimate infants, per 1,000 legitimate live births 41.55 Illegitimate infants, per 1,000 illegitimate live births 27.77 3 Births. The live births registered during the year numbered 421. This gives a live birth rate of 22.48 per 1,000 civilian population, compared with 19.3 for 1944. Still-Births. The number of still-births registered was 18, equal to a rate of 41.00 per 1,000 total births, compared with 33.6 for 1944. Deaths. The deaths registered during the year totalled 233, equal to a crude death rate for the year of 12.44 per 1,000 civilian population, compared with 20.3 for 1944, when 26.9% of the deaths were due to war operations. Of the total deaths, 140 or 60.1% were of persons 65 years of age and over, compared with 56.6% the previous year. Cancer. The Cancer death rate per 1,000 civilian population was 1.65, compared with 1.90 in 1944. . Maternal Mortality. There were no maternal deaths during the year, compared with one death during 1944. Infantile Mortality. The number of deaths under one year of age was 17, corresponding to a rate of 40.38 per 1,000 births, compared with a rate of 107.2 for 1944. Of the 17 deaths, 12 died before reaching the age of 1 week from unavoidable causes, 5 of whom lived for only a few hours. Three deaths occurred amongst infants who had attended the Child Welfare Centre. Comparative Vital Statistics. The following table shows the comparative figures for 1945.

Ambulance Facilities. Up to the 30th June, the Council's motor ambulance responded to 411 calls, 228 for private removals and 183 for accidents and sudden illness. On the 1st July, the Council's ambulance service was amalgamated with that of the Beckenham Borough Council and is working satisfactorily. Co-operation with neighbouring authorities is maintained. Maternity and Child Welfare Centre. The Maternity and Child Welfare Centre was held as before, at the School Clinic, 17, Oakfield Road, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons, and the Ante-Natal and Post-Natal Clinic on Wednesday mornings and one Monday afternoon in every four weeks. There was a marked increase in the attendances at the Centre during the year, due to the return to the district of mothers and children who had been evacuated during the War. Clinic Accommodation. The restricted accommodation at the Maternity and Child Welfare Centre has caused a certain amount of congestion and there is no doubt that extra accommodation is needed to ensure greater comfort to the Mothers and children attending the Centre.

The Night Nursery at No. 218, Anerley Road was closed on the 31st December, 1944, in consequence of the lack of children requiring admission.

Opened 298 days 5,246 9.857 15,103 50.68 56.21 The highest daily attendance was 81 and the lowest 8. The Saturday attendances were well below the average for the other days of the week.

During the year, 142 Penge cases were admitted to the Penge and Beckenham Joint Maternity Hospital, Stone Park Avenue, Beckenham.

Care of Illegitimate Children. The Council is co-operating in the arrangements adopted by the Kent County Council for the care of unmarried mothers and their children. Care of Premature Infants. Steps have been taken to implement the suggestions contained in Circular 20 /44 of the Ministry of Health.

Water Supply. All the houses in the district are provided with a constant service of water by the Metropolitan Water Board, the water being examined bacteriologically daily by the Board. In addition, the County Pathologist reports that the samples of water submitted to him quarterly were good, Bacillus coli being absent in 100 c.c's. The majority of the premises are directly connected to the rising main. Seven Storage cisterns were cleansed and covered. 8 PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. Diphtheria.

July, 1946. To the Chairman and Members of the Urban District Council of Penge. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you the Annual Report of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors (excluding that in connection with Civil Defence) for the year ending the 31st December, 1945. In addition to verbal intimation of defects found in premises, 584 written informal notices and 21 statutory notices were served under the Public Health Act, 1936. Five hundred and sixty-three intimation notices and 9 statutory notices were complied with. The Council did the work required by 8 notices served under Section 24 of the Public Health Act, 1936, respecting defective public sewers at 17 premises. The local authority also carried out, in default of the owners, the works required by 2 statutory notices served under Section 93, 6 under Section 39, 2 under Section 75 and 2 under Section 79 of the Public Health Act, 1936. The drainage systems of 42 houses were partially relaid and 139 cleared of obstructions. In many instances the drains were found to be obstructed by sanitary towels. The shortage of labour and materials again necessitated attention being given only to the more serious items of disrepair in houses, and in consequence a deterioration in the condition of property has taken place.

When considered necessary, the drains of premises were tested with smoke and any defects found made good. Your Inspectors paid 722 visits in connection with rodent infestation and no major infestations were found. During June, pre-bait and poisoned bait were laid in 246 manholes and side entrances of the foul water sewers in the district. It is estimated that at least 2,250 rats were killed in consequence of this treatment of the sewers. The number of rats killed in other premises during the year is estimated to be at least 1,480. I desire to express thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their ready consideration and support and to the Staff for their painstaking work. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. T. PEARCE, Chief Sanitary Inspector.
