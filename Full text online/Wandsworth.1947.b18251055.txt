CALEY, M.A., M.B., B.Ch., D.P.H., together with the Report of the Public Analyst WANDSWORTH BOROUGH COUNCIL Public Health Department With the Compliments of the Medical Officer of Health. Municipal Buildings, Wandsworth, S.W.18. 1 REPORT of the Medical Officer of Health for the Year 1947. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Health of the Borough for the year 1947, together with the Report of the Public Analyst. The population of the Borough at 330,820 shows an increase of 16,790 over the previous year. The birth rate, 20.17, is the highest for 28 years, and the infant mortality rate of 31 per 1,000 births is the lowest recorded since the formation of the Council in 1900. The death rate has risen from 11.89 in 1946 to 12.35. The number of deaths from cancer is still rising and has increased from 682 in 1946 to 715. The number of deaths from tuberculosis has risen slightly from 199 in 1946 to 217, and the death rate from this disease is .65, as compared with .63 for 1946. There has been a material increase in the work of the Sanitary Inspectors, due mainly to the larger number of complaints received from the public, but there are still difficulties in obtaining compliance with sanitary notices owing to shortages of materials, and this has had the effect of making the repair of insanitary houses a slow process. The attendances at the Infant Welfare Clinics have increased considerably during the year, when 75,122 attendances were made, as compared with 67,870 the previous year. The number of notified cases of infectious disease has fallen from 4,226 to 3,271. This decrease Was due mainly to fewer cases of measles, scabies and dysentery. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. G. CALEY, Medical Officer of Health. 2 STATISTICS. Population, 330,820. (1946, 314,030.) Total live births, 6,674. (M. 3,456; F. 3,218.)

The establishment of Sanitary Inspectors at the beginning of the year was 21, but only 19 were working in the Department, as Mr. F. Langford was still on duty in another Department and there was one vacancy still unfilled from the preceding year. In January Mr. Langford resigned his appointment as Sanitary Inspector and was transferred to the Housing Department. There were then two vacancies and in February one of these was filled by the appointment by Mr. J. F. Smith. Mr. H. Hough resigned from the Council's service in July, again creating a second vacancy. The position at the end of the year still left two vacancies to be filled. In the establishment of Health Visitors a vacancy created in the preceding December by the resignation of Miss Woolcock, and one created in August by the resignation of Miss Sanderson, were filled respectively by Miss C. Crump and Mrs. O. M. Filewod. 3 The establishment had been increased by one in July and this was filled by the appointment of Miss A. M. Lloyd who, however, resigned in November, thus creating a vacancy which was still unfilled at the end of the year. Mr. L. V. Webb resigned his appointment on the clerical staff in August. The following 14 temporary officers were placed on the clerical establishment as from March : Messrs. A. J. K. Green, R. E. Parker, J. P. Smith, F. A. Chislett, A. D. Briggs, A. K.

Tuberculosis Care Committee. The Committee, which meets once a month, is constituted of members of the Borough Council, representatives of authorities and organisations interested in the welfare of persons suffering from tuberculosis, and ladies and gentlemen who have a special interest in the work. Activities of the Care Committee. Details of the home conditions and financial circumstances of patients who are to receive institutional treatment are investigated. The Committee also fix the amounts patients should contribute towards the cost of dental treatment provided by the Borough Council. All persons found to be suffering from tuberculosis are interviewed by the Secretary who is able to give them advice and assistance in many directions. She also pays regular visits to patients who are being nursed at their homes, or in one of the London County Council's general hospitals. 1,872 patients were visited or interviewed during the year. The Committee controls a Fund, maintained by voluntary contributions, from which grants are made to patients who are ineligible for assistance from other organisations. Assistance from the Fund is granted to relatives to enable them to visit patients undergoing treatment in institutions. Patients are also assisted with their removal expenses to better housing accommodation, with arrears of rent and insurance payments, and fares to sanatoria.

Chronic cases are not eligible. Single men and women who are not entitled to any National Health benefit whilst undergoing treatment in an institution are eligible for pocket money up to 5/- per week. 887 patients received assistance under the scheme. Handicraft Class. A Handicraft Class is maintained by the Care Committee where tuberculous patients who are not fit for normal work are taught to make articles which they can sell. The Class meets at the Wandsworth Dispensary every Monday afternoon from 2.30 to 4.30. The Class is conducted under the supervision of the Secretary. The crafts taught include the making of articles in leather, embroidery, knitting, feltwork and the making of gloves. MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE.

Their services were utilised on four occasions during the year. An emergency obstetric unit is maintained by the London County Council, and is available to doctors and midwives on request. The object of the service is to deal with acute obstetric emergencies in connection with maternity cases which could not be moved to hospital without undue risk. The unit was utilised on twenty-nine occasions during the year. Under the Ministry of Food Welfare (Foods) Schemes all children and expectant mothers holding a green ration book are entitled to receive one pint of liquid milk a day at 2d. a pint. They can also obtain the following vitamin foods :—Cod liver oil, orange juice, and vitamin tablets. The latter are for expectant mothers only. The Scheme is administered in co-operation with officers of the Ministry of Food at the Council's Welfare Centres and food offices. Nineteen children have been sent to Convalescent Homes at a cost to the Council of £105. 14s. Od. 66 children under school age suffering from minor ailments were referred to the London County Council's Clinics for treatment. The cost to the Borough Council for this service was £13. 15s. Od.

Three women attended the Clinic post-natally, and made 6 attendances. Sunlight and massage Clinics are also held at 91 Bedford Hill, Balham, and at 37 Riggindale Road, Streatham. At the Balham Clinic 72 children were seen and made 1,274 attendances. Sixty-six children attended the Streatham Clinic and made 1,246 attendances. Each Health Visitor has been appointed Infant Life Protection Visitor for her district, and carries out the duties relating to child life protection, under Part XIII of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. At the end of the year there were 80 foster-mothers registered with the Council, but only 68 were receiving children, 83 being in their care. 10 PREMATURE INFANTS. Special records are kept of all premature infants, who are visited by the Health Visitors as soon as notified and kept under observation until it is clear that they are making satisfactory progress. There were 262 premature births during the year, 79 having occurred at home and 183 in hospital. Of those born at home, 77 were nursed at home and 60 lived through the first month of life. Of those born in hospital 27 died in the first 24 hours and 19 others during the first month. 197 of the infants survived the critical period. ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN. Since the 1st January, 1945, the Council has made an annual grant of £343 to the Southwark Diocesan Association towards the cost of maintenance in the Association's institutions of unmarried mothers whose homes are in the Borough. There is close co-operation between the Council's Health Visitors and the officers of the Association for making appropriate arrangements for individual cases. MATERNITY HOME. The Council's Maternity Home has been operating throughout the year, although it has not been possible to utilize all the beds owing to the difficulty of obtaining a full complement of midwives and nurses. 311 women were admitted during the year, and the average duration of stay was 14.31 days. 314 new cases attended the Ante-natal Clinic held at the Maternity Home and made 3,628 attendances. 244 cases attended the Post-natal Clinic. HOME HELPS SERVICE. For many years the Council has granted financial assistance to expectant mothers who arrange to have their confinements at home, and have engaged suitable women to assist them, if they were found to need such assistance. During 1947 assistance was granted to 102 cases. In January, 1946, the scheme was extended and the Council now provide home helps for sick and infirm persons and maternity cases who do not make their own arrangements. It is not always possible to meet all the demands received, as the number of women available to act as home helps is limited. Twenty-two were employed at the end of 1947, most of them working on a part-time basis. 11 Applicants for the service are required to pay a proportion of the cost according to their means The following table shows the number of cases dealt with during the year:— Maternity cases.

There has been a large increase in the amount of work carried out by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year, and this is mainly due to the larger number of complaints received from Borough residents. Sanitary defects were found at 9,417 houses, as compared with 7,595 in 1946 and 2,728 in 1945. At 811 houses the defects were remedied without the necessity for serving a notice, but intimation notices were required in respect of the remaining 8,606 houses. 3,660 of these notices were complied with during the year without the necessity of serving nuisance notices. A further 2,494 intimation notices served in 1946 were complied with in 1947. The number of nuisance notices served during 1947 was 1,765 and 1,386 such notices were complied with, including a number served in the previous year. Proceedings at the Police Court were instituted in respect of 192 premises. The total number of visits made by the Sanitary Inspectors during the year in connection with housing and nuisances was 46,138; this figure compares with 44,531 visits in 1946, and 18,444 in 1945. Nearly all these visits were for the purpose of investigating and dealing with complaints. CLEARANCE OF INSANITARY HOUSES. Clearance Areas. Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 North Passage, six houses forming part of the North Passage Clearance Area, declared as such on 27th June, 1939, which had become dangerous as a result of damage by enemy action, were demolished during the year. On 30th March I made a representation in respect of six houses, 17 to 27 (odd) Garratt Lane, which was submitted to the London County Council, who informed the Borough Council that that Authority proposed to deal with the area. One of these houses, No. 27, has been demolished as a dangerous structure. Demolition Orders. Orders have been made for the demolition of four houses, namely, 68 and 70 Garratt Lane and 2 and 4 Westbury Street. Closing Orders. A Closing Order was made on a fourroomed mews flat at 2 South Side, Streatham Common, and the flat was vacated shortly after the Order had been made. Closing Orders were also made on 26 basement flats, comprising 77 rooms, 54 of which were underground rooms. These basements were at 364 to 370 Clapham Road, 23 Broadhinton Road, 58 North 13 Street, 85a Trinity Road, 1 Floss Street, 8 Balham Grove, and at 1 and 3, 9 to 33 and 45 and 47 Byrne Road. Nine of these basements were vacated by the end of the year, resulting in the closure of 16 underground rooms. In addition to the basement flats in Byrne Road for which Closing Orders were made, eight others were represented as unfit for habitation, namely, Nos. 35 to 43 and 49 to 53 (odd). In these cases the owners submitted proposals for carrying out the alterations required and these undertakings were accepted by the Council, no Closing Orders being made. RAT CAMPAIGN. On the 16th July, 1946, the Council decided to participate in the Ministry of Food's Private Dwellings Special Scheme, which called for the systematic treatment by pre-baiting and baiting of areas in the Borough known to be infested by rats. The Ministry agreed to contribute 60 per cent. of the cost of the scheme, provided a charge was made to the occupiers of business premises which came under treatment as part of an area, and to householders whose neglect causes infestation. During the year 1,740 complaints of the presence of rats were investigated and dealt with by the Council's rat operatives, who made 23,838 visits. MORTUARY AND CREMATORIUM. The Mortuary at Wandsworth was used throughout the year, and 270 bodies were received there. As Medical Referees under the Crematorium Regulations, 1930, Dr. MacDonnell and I have authorised 626 cremations, which took place at the Crematorium at Putney Vale Cemetery. SUPERVISION OF FOOD. There are four Inspectors engaged in the supervision of the food supply. The number of separate food premises is 2,709 and during 1947 they were inspected on 30,174 occasions. There are 121 registered dairies and 387 persons registered to sell milk from premises other than dairies. The bulk of the milk sold by retail within the Borough is sent out in bottles filled in properly constructed dairies, and its quality is good. 794 samples were submitted for analysis. 793 of these were genuine, with an average fat content of 3.60 per cent. 388 samples of milk were submitted for bacteriological examination, the phosphatase test, the methylene blue test and the coliform 14 test. Twenty-seven of these failed to comply with the prescribed tests. Ninety-three licences for the sale of designated milks were granted during the year—37 for Tuberculin Tested milk, 35 for Pasteurised milk and 21 for Tuberculin Tested (Pasteurised) milk. 109 samples of ice-cream were submitted for bacteriological examination, the coliform test and the methylene blue test. All these samples were reported as genuine. Twenty-eight samples of artesian well water were submitted for bacteriological and chemical examination. There are four private slaughterhouses in the Borough. Seven animals were inspected either before or after slaughter. There are now 19 war-time piggeries in the Borough. 123 inspections were made. During the year three applications were received from persons desirous of acting as slaughtermen. 125 varieties of foodstuffs suspected to be unsound were examined at the request of the owners and afterwards released for animal feeding. The necessary certificate was granted in every case. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938. 2,016 samples were procured for analysis during the year— 794 samples of milk, 1,076 other foodstuffs and 146 drugs. Ten samples were found to be adulterated, one each of milk, canned soup, flour, self-raising flour, salami sausage, non-brewed vinegar, chocolate cup, semolina, malt vinegar and iodine solution. It was not necessary to take Police Court proceedings in any of these cases, but proceedings under Sections 3 and 9 of the above Act were taken in respect of two cases of foreign matter in bread and one case of foreign matter in a Chelsea bun. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933, and Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Applications were received from 327 persons for their names to be entered on the Council's Register of sellers of poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List. 656 inspections under these Acts were made by the Food Inspectors. FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. There were 1,450 factories and workshops on the Register at the end of 1947 and, in addition, 181 persons were receiving workto be done in their homes. It was possible to make only 113 inspections owing to the large amount of housing work, and 42 notices were served in respect of nuisances found. 15 REPORT OF THE PUBLIC ANALYST. During the year 2,016 samples were submitted, all being informal. The samples submitted for analysis consisted of 794 milk, 1,076 other foodstuffs and 146 drugs. One sample of milk was found to be adulterated. The average composition of the milk analysed during the year was : Total milk solids, 12.37, milk fat 3.60, non-fatty solids 8.77. Nine samples of other foodstuffs were found to be adulterated, viz. : chocolate cup, infested with mites; salami sausage, decomposed; flour, contained sodium bicarbonate; flour, self-raising, excess of sodium bicarbonate; non-brewed vinegar, 37 per cent. deficient in acetic acid; canned tomato soup, bitter flavour due to the use of unsound fruit; malt vinegar, 7½ per cent. deficient in acetic acid; semolina, infested with mites; tincture of iodine, contained Friar's Balsam. Samples of the following substances were analysed: bread, four samples; butter, 102; cheese, 103; cocoa, 17; coffee, 11; confectionery, 3; flour, 7; jam and marmalade, 23; lard and cooking fat, 101; margarine, 104; meat, canned, 9; meat products, 5; milk, canned, 11; sugar, 103; tea, 103; vinegar, 11. The average water content of the 102 samples of butter was 14.95 per cent.; that of the 104 samples of margarine, 14.75 per cent. The average boric acid content of the samples of margarine was 0.19 per cent. Nine of the samples were submitted for analysis on the complaints of ratepayers, viz. : anchovy paste, lemonade powder, sherbet powder, malt bar, chocolate. All of these samples were genuine and the complaints not justified. In conclusion we have to report that the adulteration detected during 1947 was 0.5 per cent. of all samples submitted.
