THE BORD OF WORKS FOR THE St. (Biles District. GENERAL REPORT. Meetings. During the year ending the 25th day of March, 1890, 97 Meetings of the Board and its various Committees have been held. The following are the particulars :— Board Meetings— Ordinary Meetings 23 Special Meetings 2 Committee Meetings- Finance 22 Law and Parliamentary 9 Sanitary 15 Works 22 Special 4 Making a Total of . 97 meetings This list shows that the increase in the Board's business, which has been referred to in previous years, gradually progresses, and the remarks that have been made in recent reports as to the length of the meetings are equally applicable to the proceedings of the oast year. 9 The Past Year. The year has not been entirely uneventful so far as the Metropolis has been concerned, for the year which closed on the 25th March, 1890, saw the London County Council take up the reins of Local Government in the Metropolis, pursuant to the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888; but, so far as the St. Giles District is solely concerned, although a very large amount of business has been transacted by the Board and its Officers, it has been to a considerable extent of ordinary routine, but some of the more important of the matters which have been engaging the attention of the Board will be dealt with hereafter, and a general statement as to the work will be found appended. Aonual Accounts. A statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Board and of the liabilities and assets to the 25th March, 1890, are printed at pages 34 to 49. The Accounts, prior to their being audited by Messrs. W. A. Cooper, W. Edlow, and T. W. Matthews, the Auditors elected by the Board in accordance with the provisions of the 195th Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, were examined by the Board's Chartered Accountant, Mr. T. P. Scrivener, by whom also the whole of the Account Books in use by the Board were subjected to a periodical checking once a month. The Auditors have stated the result of their examination in the Certificate which will be found on page 50. The details of the Accounts are somewhat different to 10 those of previous years, because while the Board formerly raised the amount for defraying the precepts of the Metropolitan Board of Works, the duty of raising the sums required by the London County Council now devolves upon the Guardians of the Poor. Unfortunately, the precept of the School Board for London was not less than that of previous years, and the hopes that had been entertained that a reduction in the expediture of the School Board had been effected, and that a consequent reduction of the rate might be anticipated, was not fulfilled. The Board from time to time have caused representations to be addressed to the School Board for London calling their attention to the extremely inconvenient dates at which the precepts are made payable, and the very great difficulty which occurs in raising the amounts. The School Board have, to a certain extent, complied with the Board's suggestions, but there is still room for further improvement in this respect. Change in the Members of the Board. No Members have died during the past year. One Member only has retired, viz., Mr. Thomas Willson, who had been an active Member of the Board, and of certain of its Committees, for several years, and who did not seek reelection. The Board much regretted to receive the intimation of his intentions, and unanimously directed the Clerk to communicate with Mr. Willson and express their feelings, and tender their hearty thanks for the services he had rendered. From rumours that have reached the ears of the Board, it is to be feared that at the approaching Election they will 11 lose several of their old colleagues, who, from ill-health and other causes, do not propose to seek re-election. Re-appointment of Medical Officer of Health. The Local Government Act of 1888 contained a provision requiring County Councils to pay one-half of the Salaries of Medical Officers of Health whose qualifications, appointment, salary and tenure were in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board. The Board having referred the subject to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, that Committee brought up a recommendation to the effect " That in the " Public Health interests of the District it was desirable " that the Medical Officer should not be engaged in the " private practice of his profession, and on that uuderstand" ing, and on condition that he resided within the District "and did not hold any other appointment without the " consent of the Board, they recommended that Dr. Samuel " Robert Lovett should be re-appointed Medical Officer of " Health of the District at a Salary of £600 per annnm." The recommendation having been adopted by the Board, proposals for the re-appointment of Dr. Lovett were submitted to the Local Government Board, who, upon condition that, " In the event of his losing his office by reason of the " appointment of a Medical Officer of Health for an extended " area including the whole or part of the District assigned to " him, he will make no claim to compensation for any loss of " emoluments exceeding the salary of £300 per annum " which he has hitherto received," being agreed to, stated they were ready to sanction the proposed re-appointment. Dr. Lovett being willing to accept these conditions, he 12 was, on the 11th day of February, 1890, re appointed Medical Officer of Health on the terms of the above undertaking. Application has since been made to the London County Council, and intimation has been received, that from time to time a moiety of the salary will be repaid to the Board annually at Michaelmas. Maintenance of Main Roads. The Local Government Act, 1888, by the 41st Section, extended the provisions of the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878, with respect to "main roads" to the Metropolis, and the Board having received a communication from the London County Council, enquiring whether they proposed to ask the Council to declare any Streets within the District to be Main Roads within the meaning of the Act, the Board, on the 7th November, 1889, transmitted the following list, at the same time claiming the right of retaining the powers and duties of maintaining and repairing the roads, viz. :— Tottenham Court Road. High Holborn. New Oxford Street. Broad Street. Shaftesbury Avenue. Charing Cross Road. Cambridge Circus. High Street. Great St. Andrew Street. Seven Dials. Little St. Andrew Street. Great Queen Street. Little Queen Street. Southampton Row. Russell Square (East Side). Hart Street. Bloomsbury Square (South Side). Vernon Place. Theobald's Road. Endell Street. Bloomsbury Street. Charlotte Street. Bedford Square (East Side). Gower Street. 13 The London County Council appear to have considered the application in common with others received from various Local Authorities in the Metropolis. It is stated that the total length of streets which the Council were asked to declare as main roads was 412 miles. The applications were dealt with by the Highways Committee of the Council, who were of opinion that the provisions of the Local Government Act, and of the Highways and Locomotives Act, with reference to main roads, were " totally inapplicable to thoroughfares of the County of " London, having regard to the different conditions under " which they were managed and to the number of Authori" ties concerned in their management," and they therefore determined to ask Her Majesty's Government to take the necessary steps for amending the Local Government Act, 1888, by exempting the County of London from its provisions on the subject of main roads. The matter has, it is believed, been brought before the President of the Local Government Board, but no decision upon the question has yet been announced. The question is an extremely serious one, especially for a District like St. Giles, which contains so much more than its due proportion of certain roads. And it is difficult to believe that the Legislature, having so recently placed the Metropolis within the scope of the Highways and Locomotives Act, would be likely to now exempt the same. The decision will be awaited with considerable interest.* * A communication has been received, dated the 21st May, 1890, stating that the London County Council decline to accede to the Board's application. 14 Parliamentary Schemes. This subject will be dealt with as in previous years, under separate headings, viz. Public Bills, Private Bills and Applications for Provisional Order. (a) PUBLIC BILLS. Of the Public Bills which received attention during the past year, the following is a list of the most important London Coal and Wine Dues (Continuance) Bill. Monumental Chapel Bill. School Board for London (Pensions) Bill. Metropolis Eating Bill. Advertising Stations Eating Bill. Government Department (Transfer of Powers) Bill. Police (Metropolis) Bill. Coal Dues (London) Abolition Bill. Housing of the Working Classes Bill. Housing of the Working Classes (London) Bill. Housing of the Working Classes (Metropolis) Bill. Technical Education Bill. School Board for London (Elections) Bill. Superannuation of Officers (County Council) Bill. Metropolitan Rating Amendment Bill. The County of London Bill. Municipal Corporation and County Electors Bill. Sanitary Registration of Buildings Bill. Shops Weekly Half-holiday Bill. Metropolis Water Supply Bill. Begistration of Voters in the Metropolis Bill. Poor Bate (Metropolis) Bill. Electors' Qualification and Registration Bill. Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Bill. The measures were all dealt with by the Law and Parliamentary Committee of the Board, who received reports from the Officers upon the provisions. 15 la some cases petitions were presented either in favour of or against the Bills, while in others it was not deemed necessary to take any action beyond merely expressing approval or disapproval of the measures, which was commnicated to the Members introducing the Bills or to the Authorities responsible for them. (b) PRIVATE BILLS. Of the Private Bills, the most important was the Central London Railway Bill, which will be referred to in detail directly. Plans and Books of Reference were also deposited with regard to the following measures :— North and South London Subway Railway Bill. London Central Subway Railway Bill. London Streets Removal of Gates and Bars Bill. The only other private measure was:— The London Subways and Overhead Wires Bill. To refer to these projects in their order briefly, for they are dealt with by the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board in his Report. (a) THE CENTRAL LONDON RAILWAY BILL Was a proposal to construct an Underground Railway from Queen's Road, Bayswater, to King William Street, City, with Stations at Queen's Road, the Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Little Queen Street, Holborn Circus, St. Martin's-le-Grand, the Mansion House and the Monument. The Railway was proposed to be constructed at an average depth of about 50 feet below the surface, and the Board having very carefully considered the proposals of the Promoters and the restrictions which the Bill proposed to place 16 upon them, determined not to oppose the Preamble of the Bill, but merely to petition with a view of obtaining a locus standi to secure the insertion of protective clauses. A Petition was accordingly prepared and presented to the House of Commons, but before the Bill was considered by the Committee to whom it was referred after second reading, the Promoters submitted for the approval of the Board certain clauses with a view to meeting the objections raised. These contained very valuable concessions towards the Board, including a proviso that, in the event of a Station being constructed at Little Queen Street, that thoroughfare * should be widened. These clauses having been carefully examined, and the Promoters expressing their willingness to pay the expenses which the Board up to that date had incurred in the matter, the Board, on an undertaking being received for the insertion of the Clauses and the payment of the costs, gave instructions for the withdrawal of the Petition.* (b) NORTH AND SOUTH LONDON RAILWAY BILL. This was a measure for the construction of a Subway Railway from Camden Town to the Elephant and Castle, Newington, which proposed to pass down Tottenham Court Road and Charing Cross Road, and other Streets in the District. The Bill was deposited, but before any steps could be taken with regard to the same, the Promoters intimated that they did not intend to proceed with the measure. (c) THE LONDON CENTRAL SUBWAY RAILWAY BILL Was a proposal for power to construct a Subway Railway between Shepherd's Bush Common and Tottenham *The Bill subsequently passed the House of Commons, but his been rejected by the House of Lords. 17 Court Road, the Terminus being in New Oxford Street, by Dyott Street. The Bill was framed very much upon the lines of the London Central Subway Railway Bill of 1889, which was referred to in the last Report, but which was rejected by the House of Commons Committee. This Bill was also dropped before any progress had been made with it. (d) LONDON STREETS REMOVAL OF GATES AND BARS BILL. This was a Bill promoted by the London County Council for the removal of certain restrictions upon traffic in certain Streets of London, and affected the interests of the Board both directly and indirectly, as the Gates which were proposed to be removed were those across the North-East end of Torrington Place, across Gordon Street and Upper Woburn Place, and also that situate in Sidmouth Street, Gray's Inn Road. The Bill was referred by the Board to the Law and Parliamentary Committee for consideration and report, and they recommended that the Board, while not expressing any opinion with regard to the general provisions of the Bill, should approve of that part which proposed to empower the owners of the Gates and the London County Council to enter into Agreements as to the removal of the Gates and as to the opening of the Streets now closed, at such times and for such class of traffic as might be agreed upon, but the Board did not see their way to go further than this, particularly as the Bill did not propose to provide for the payment of compensation to any persons who might be injuriously affected in the event of the Gates being removed without such Agreement being come to. At the time this Report is prepared no progress has been c 18 made with the Bill beyond second reading and a reference to a Select Committee.* (e) LONDON SUBWAYS AND OVERHEAD WIRES BILL This was a measure also promoted by the London County Council, to enable them to make Subways under Streets and to provide for the control and regulation of overhead wires. The powers which it was proposed to confer upon the London County Council, with regard to Subways in particular, were felt by the Board to be of so extraordinary a character, and such as would involve such tremendous interference with the public ways of the District, that the Board felt they had no alternative but to offer a most strenuous opposition to the measure. A Petition was accordingly presented to the House of Commons against the Bill, and the London County Council finding that they could not contest the arguments which had been used against their proposals, abandoned so much of the Bill as referred to Subways. The proposals as to Overhead Wires were not such as the Board hoped would have been put forward in any measure promoted by the County Council, as the Board objected that, if the Bill became law, it would extend and legalise a system which they felt to be dangerous and injurious to the property of the public by perpetuating the system of Overhead Wires, and that the proposal which the County Council sought to make law, with regard to the rights of private property, were an unjust interference, and ought not to be permitted. The Board, therefore, determined to oppose that portion of the Bill, and presented a Petition to the House of Commons against it. The Bill has been read a second time and referred to a *The Bill has since been passed by the Select Committee. 19 Select Committee, but at the date of preparing this Report the Committee have not met to consider it.* (c) PROVISIONAL ORDERS. STRAND & ST. GILES. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notices were deposited by the Electric Supply Corporation of their intention to apply for a Provisional Order under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882-1888, for lighting the St. Giles District. The Plans were deposited, but the Order was never prepared, and nothing further has been done. TI1E METROPOLITAN ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY (LIMITED). In the last Report reference was made to the Enquiry held by Major Marindin, C.M.G., R.E., into the proposals of the London Electric Supply Corporation and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, at which he decided that powers should be granted to the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company to supply electricity in the St. Giles District. The Provisional Order as settled by the Board of Trade was amended by the House of Commons, and in a somewhat altered form passed into law at the close of the Session. The Company lost no time in using the powers conferred upon them, and before the end of the year 188y, they had already laid a considerable length of mains and tubes. The works of the Company extensively affected the Streets under the control the Board, and Mr. George Wallace, the Board's Engineer and Surveyor, wan invested by the Board with all necessary powers for protecting its interests. For * The Committee have since passed the Bill with considerable modifications, but it has been rejected on third reading. C 2 20 further details as to the nature of the works performed, reference should be made to his Report. The St, Giles Church Yard. For several years past suggestions have been made as to the desirability of the Burial Ground adjoining the St. Giles' Church being laid out as an open space under the provisions of the Open Spaces Act, 1887, and on the 4th April, 1889, a communication was received from the Rev. Canon Nisbet enquiring whether the Board were prepared to undertake the suitable laying out and maintenance of the ground in the event of its being handed over to them for the use of the public. After very careful consideration, and receiving Reports from its Officers, the Board resolved to take a lease of the Churchyard for 21 years, determinable at any time at the Board's option by six calendar months' previous notice, and to lay out the same in accordance with the plan which was prepared for the purpose. The proposals were accepted by the Rector and Churchwardens, and approved by the Vestry of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and steps are now being taken to obtain the necessary Faculty for legalising the proposed alterations. The annual cost of maintaining the Churchyard and providing for a Caretaker, is estimated at £100. The Artizans and Labourers Dwellings Acts, 1868 to 1885. During the past year the Medical Officer of Health reported that the following premises weie in a state dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation, 21 viz., 1 to 8, Cottage Place; 3, Betterton Street; 16, Queen Street; 11, 13, 15 and 17, Sardinia Place. He also reported that the building situate at the rear of No. 46, Kenton Street, although not in itself unfit for human habitation was jet so situated as to obstruct ventilation and otherwise conduce to make the premises Nos. 1 to 8 Cottage Place unfit for human habitation and he recommended that it should be demolished. The Board having referred the Reports to their Engineer and Surveyor and his Reports having been received the Board ordered that the premises, No. 3, Betterton Street should be demolished and that the other premises should be repaired. With regard to the obstructive building in the rear of No. 46, Kenton Street, the owners of the property the Foundling Hospital intimated that the premises, Nos. 1 to 8, Cottage Place had been erected without their knowledge and without their sanction and that they were prepared to demolish them and this having been done the Building in tlie rear of No. 46, Kenton Street was no longer "obstructive " and no action was therefore taken with respect to the same. The works to the houses in Sardinia Place were carried out, but nothing was done by the Owner with regard to No. ] 6, Queen Street, and the Board were therefore compelled to take steps to close the same. Artizan's Dwellings Acts, 1875 to 1885. THE SIIELTON STREET AREA. The work of demolishing the premises on the above area has been proceeded with during past year but no steps have yet been taken by the London County Council for re-housing the inhabitants who were dispossessed. 22 It is hoped that no further loss of time will occur as the want of tenement dwellings in the neighbourhood is much felt. Sanitary and Nuisances Removal Acts. A large amount of work has been carried out under the above Acts during the past year, the details of which will be found in the Report of the Medical Officer of Health. In cases where the Owners or Occupiers failed to comply with the Orders made by the Board, proceedings were taken and in every instance the Orders made were supported by the Magistrate and fines and costs were inflicted in most of them. The question of the necessity for the frequent removal of manure was brought to the attention of the Board by Mr. Alfred Hoare, C.C., one of the Representatives of the Holborn Division of Finsbury on the London County Council and the Board directed the Clerk to issue a Notice to every occupier of Stables in the District, drawing attention to the provisions of the Nuisances Removal Act upon the subject, and urging upon them the necessity for complying therewith by ensuring the frequent periodical removal of manure and it is satisfactory to state that, but few complaints are received of any failure to comply with the Board's instructions. Lodging House Regulations, These regulations continue to considerably assist the Board in dealing with houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. There are 553 Registered Lodging Houses in the District. 23 456 Notices have been served during the past year, calling the attention of Owners to breaches of regulations. In certain instances it has been necessary to take proceedings, in consequence of the Notices not being attended to. In every case in which this has been done the Owners have been convicted by the Magistrates, and either fined or cautioned, and ordered to pay the costs. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 1875 to 1879. These Acts have again been rigidly enforced within the District. 176 samples of Food, and 36 of Drugs, have been purchased, consisting of milk, butter, cheese, coffee, flour, bread, olives, capers, green peas, beans, tomatoes, rum, whiskey, gin, brandy, sal volatile, iodide of potassium and a prescription of these nine samples of food and one of drugs were found to be adulterated. In 10 cases proceedings were taken before the Police Magistrates. In three of them the Magistrate was of opinion that the adulteration was of so trifling a nature that he merely ordered the payment of the costs. The total amount received for fines and costs was £11 lis. One matter of extreme importance was the purchase of the samples of Sal Volatile, one of which was not prepared according to the recipe in the "British Pharmacopoeia." This was denied, and it was endeavoured to establish that there was no necessity for the Sal Volatile to be prepared according to the "British Pharmacopoeia,'' but that other recipes would be equally satisfactory. The Board took considerable trouble over the matter, and retained the services of Counsel. The result was a conviction, and the Defendant was fined and ordered to pay costs. 24 The case excited considerable interest in the Pharmaceutical and Medical Journals, and the action of the Board was deemed as highly satisfactory. The St. Giles' District is still well to the front in the discharge of its duties under the Act, the samples purchased bearing a very satisfactory ratio to the population. Dr. Redwood was re-appointed Analyst for the year on the 23rd day of July. His Report will be found on page 33. Obstructions on the Public Way. Several cases have been dealt with during the past year, and in some instances it has been found necessary to take proceedings against the offending parties. Vacant Land in Shaftesbury Avenue. At the entrance to Shaftesbury Avenue from New Oxfoi-d Street there are two pieces of vacant land which the Board have, for some years, endeavoured by every effort in its power to retain as open spaces. Considerable negotiations ensued with the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the difficulty which that Board felt was that they had no power to part with possession of vacant land except by selling. A proviso was, however, inserted in the Metropolis Improvement Act, 1889, enabling the London County Council to enclose and lay out and plant the two pieces of land in question and to enter into an agreement with the Board, providing for the use of the pieces of land, or enabling the Council to sell, convey or the lease two pieces of land to the Board for public purposes, on such terms and conditions as the Council might think fit. The Bill having received the Royal assent, the Board 25 entered into communication with the London County Council upon the subject, and, in reply to a communication, intimitated that they were prepared to lay out and maintain the Northernmost piece of land as an open space, and, with regard to the Southernmost piece, they proposed to devote it to the purpose of constructing an underground place of convenience for men and women. The Council still have the matter under consideration, and it is to be hoped that some decision will shortly he arrived at, as the present condition of the land is extremely unsightly. In connection with the subject, the Board received from one of its Members, Mr. James Neale, an offer to erect a very handsome drinking fountain in memory of his late Mother, which offer was gratefully accepted. The exact site for the erection of the fountain has not however yet been decided upon. Contracts for Works and Supply of Goods, The question of the system under which goods were supplied and works performed for the Board, has been carefully considered during the past year, and the subject was referred to a Special Committee, consisting of 24 Members, who presented a very comprehensive report upon the subject, and their recommendations were unanimously adopted. Removal of Dust and Ashes, At the request of the Board, Mr. George Cookson, of Gloucester Street, Albert Embankment, whose tender for the removal of dust and ashes had been accepted by the Board, has employed in the removal of refuse from the 26 District, proper covered carts or wagons which he had caused to be constructed especially for the purposes of the District. The Board believes that the wagons are a great improvement, and that the complaints which were frequently received previously as to the annoyance caused by the contents of the dust-bin being blown about in the public ways will now be obviated. Improvement. The widening of Bucknall Street, formerly Church Lane received the attention of the Board several years since, but it was not until the present year that the lease of certain properties fell in which enabled the Board to call upon the Owner the Rev. Henry Hanmer to carry out the Agreement which had been entered into with his predecessor. The Reverend Gentleman immediately complied with the request and the improvement has since been completed. Projections Into, Over, and Beneath the Public Way. This subject which is one of extreme importance and at the same time of considerable difficulty has received a great deal of attention at the hands of the Board during the past year. The obstructions which, on being continually placed above, on, and under the Public Way, were felt by the Board to be of so important a nature that they referred the question to the Works Committee for consideration and Report and the Committee have requested the Clerk and Surveyor to present a detailed Report upon the subject which will shortly be done and the subject will then be further considered. 27 London Hydraulic Power Company. This Company was empowered by Acts of Parliament passed in the years 1871 and 188 4 to supply Hydraulic Power in the Metropolis and, subject to certain conditions, to lay their mains under the Public Ways. Several applications have been received from the Company and dealt with during the past year. In each case they have been granted, subject to proper restrictions for protecting the interests of the Board and its rate-payers. Hackney Carriage Standings. This subject has been dealt with in previous Reports and in the month of May last a communication was received intimating that the Commissioner of Police had appointed Hackney Carriage Standings as follows :— 20 in the Centre of the roadway of High Holborn between Grays Inn Road and Chancery Lane, 18 between Red Lion Yard and Little Queen Street, 15 between Southampton Street a-id Bloomsbury Court and 5 in New Oxford Street, between Duke Street and Bloomsbury Street. Upon consideiation of the matter the Board came to the conclusion that parts at all events of the proposed standings were unsuitable, and they protested against the action taken by the Commissioner on the grounds that the roadways of the parts particularly referred to were too narrow for the purpose. The matter was referred to the Clerk and the Engineer and Surveyor to the Board, who had an interview with the Chief Constable of the Metropolis upon the subject, with the result that those parts of the Streets which the Board objected to were abandoned by the Commissioner and others substituted. 28 Infections Disease (Notification) Act, 1889. This most important Act, relating to the notification of certain Infectious Diseases, received the Royal Assent upon the 30th day of August, 1889, and came into operation in the Metropolis on the 30th day of October, 1889. The Board, immediately after the passing of the Act, took the necessary steps for making its provisions known to the ratepayers in the District, and the Clerk to the Board and the Medical Officer of Health received the necessary instructions for carrying the Act into effect. The forms of notices and certificates and other matters which were required were immediately prepared, and the Act has, up to the present time, been found to work extremely well so far as the St. Giles' District is concerned. The amounts which the Board have paid for certificates received from Medical Men have been refunded by the Metropolitan Asylums Board in accordance with the provisions of the Act. It has not been found necessary to take any proceedings for failure to comply with the Act. The Board, in the month of February last, resolved to comply with a request received from the School Board for London, and to notify to the School Board Superintendent of Visitors for the District, all cases of Scarlet Fever, Smallpox and Diphtheria which are notified to the Board by householders under the Act. Closing of Princes Court At the l-equest of Messrs. Lambert & Butler, and with the approval of the adjoining owners, the Board consented to an application being made to the Justices of the Peace for closing Princes Court, Drury Lane, but upon the 29 cation coming before the Justices, they refused to grant it. This court is the last one remaining between Kemble Street and Long Acre, and it might well have been demolished by the Metropolitan Board of Works when the Scheme for dealing with the Great Wild Street area was under consideration, for it is the earnest desire of all parties in the neighbourhood that it should be stopped up, and the evidence of the Police was strongly in favour of such a course being adopted. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriage-way Pavements. The subject of the Maintenance of Asphalte Carriageway Pavements in the District, is one that has during the past few years caused the Board and its Officers very great anxiety, as in consequence of the great increase in the traffic through the streets in the District and the alterations in its character, the Board have found that the expense of maintaining the carriageways has very largely increased, and that in those cases in which they did not avail themselves of the provisions contained in the contracts, and call upon the companies who laid down the pavements to maintain them at a specific charge, mentioned in the contract, that they have had to expend very large sums in repairing the carriageways in question. The Board, therefore, in the month of July, 1889, on the suggestion of their Officers, requested the Works Committee to consider whether it was not desirable that the Board should enter into contracts for the maintenance of the carriageways in the District at a fixed annual charge, and after consideration of reports from the Officers upon the sums which have been expended, and upon the condition of the various carriageways, it was resolved to enter into arrangements with the Companies 30 whereby the whole of the asphalte carriageways in the District would be in future maintained under contract. It is believed that this resolution, although it involved the payment of a considerable sum of money, will ultimately be found to be a considerable saving to the Board. Bicycles and Tricycles. Among the various subjects that received consideration at the hands of the Board, was the excessive speed at which Bicycles and Tricycles are ridden in the streets of the Metropolis, and communications were addressed to the London County Council and the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis, with a view to the prevention of what was felt by the Board to be a growing nuisance. Steps are taken, but it is feared that very little real improvement has yet been made. Sale of Horse Flesh Regulation Act, 1889. This Act received the Royal assent on the 24th June, 1889. It made regulations with respect to the Sale of Horse Flesh for human food, and provided that no person should sell, offer or expose any Horse Flesh for human food except in a shop, or place, over which words indicating that Horse Flesh was sold there should be legibly expressed. The Board have given instructions to their Clerk and Medical Officer of Health to carry the Act into effect. Advertising Stations (Raticg) Act, 1889. The subject of rating hoardings used for advertising purposes, is one that has exercised the minds of rating Authorities in the Metropolis for many years past. During the 31 past session a Bill introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Burdett Coutts, M P., passed into Law which enables Local Authorities to prohibit or allow the affixing of advertisements to hoardings erected under license granted by them. The Board decided to allow the affixing of advertisements and accordingly a scale of charges was prepared and approved of by the Works Committee. Housing of the Working Classes. On the 2nd December, 1889, a communication was received from the President of the Local Government Board calling the attention of the Board to the duties imposed upon them by the Housing of the Working Classes, England, Act, 1885 and the large powers which they possessed under the Nuisance Removal Acts and other Statutes in relation to the great and pressing question of the Housing of the Labouring Classes. The Board referred this communication to their Clerk to confer with the Medical Officer of Health and reply to the same, and this having been done, on the 25th February a communication was received from the President of the Local Government Board, acknowledging the receipt of the communication forwarded by the Clerk and expressing satisfaction at its content in the following words:— " The Local Government Board direct me to thank you "for the interesting particulars furnished by you and to " express their satisfaction at the action which has been taken " by the Board of Works in order to carry into effect the provisions of the different statutes mentioned in your letter." 32 Public Health Consolidation Hill. On the 31st January, 1890 a communication was received from the President of the Local Government Board, transmitting a copy of a Bill which he proposed to introduce into Parliament for consolidating the Laws relating to public Health in the Metropolis, and inviting the observations of the Board thereon. The Bill proposed to amend the Sanitary Laws for London which extend from the year 1819 to that now under review. The Board referred the communication and the Draft Bill to the Clerk and Medical Officer of Health, for consideration and report,, and at the time that this Report is prepared the Statement which has been prepared by those Officers is under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee. HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board. 11th June, 1890. 33 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ANALYST APPOINTED UNDER THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES' DISTRICT. Gentlemen, During the year ending 25th March, 1890, I received from your Inspectors, Messrs. J. Hoyle and J. Smith, 213 samples for analysis, consisting of bread, brandy, butter, cheese, coffee, flour, gin, iodide of potassium, marjoram, milk, pepper, a prescription, preserved fruits and vegetables, rum, sal volatile and whiskey. Of these twelve were found to be adulterated, viz.:—two of gin, seven of milk, two of rum and one of sal-volatile, 4 samples of milk were poor and 4 of sal-volatile were deficient in strength. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, T. REDWOOD. 2, Fisher Street, Red Lion Square, London, W.C. m July, 1890. D 34 35 THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE SAINT GILES DISTRICT.

Engineer and Surveyors Department, 197, High Holborn, W.C. 24th June, 1890.

Goldsmith Street. Brunswick Square. Handel Street. Bury Street Montague Place. Russell Square. Improvement, Russell Square. The footway on the east side of Russell Square, next to the gardens, was widened from 6ft. to 12ft. along the straight portion of the Square, and to 16ft. at the north-east and south-east corners. The old york stone and granite kerb was used for this work as far as it went, and the deficiency made good with new materials of similar description. This work has given general satisfaction to people using the Square, and is considered a great improvement, many 53 persons expressing a wish that the widening should be extended around the whole four sides of the Square. The nett cost of the work was £289 0s. 5d. Maintenance of Asphalte Carriageway Pavements. The question of the maintenance of the asphalte carriageway pavements, of which there is now a considerable area within the District, was considered by your Board during the year. The contracts that had been made between the Board and the various asphalte companies gave the Board power to call upon the companies to either perform all necessary repairs at certain charges per superficial yard as executed, or to maintain the different streets, at certain fixed charges per square yard per annum, extending over the whole area of the pavements. Some of the pavements were becoming in bad condition, and your Board referred the matter to your Works Committee to consider and report as to what would, in the opinion of the Committee, be the better course of the two to adopt with respect to these pavements. The Committee had several meetings upon the matter, and ultimately recommended your Board to call upon the companies to enter into contracts for their maintenance at per square yard per annum measured over the whole surface, and this was done with respect to the undermentioned streets:— Bloomsbury Place. Museum Ptreet. Bloomsbury Square (south and east New Oxford Street. tides). Russell Square (east side). Drury Lane, from Broad street to Sardinia Street. Great Queen Street. Southampton Row. Gower Street. Torrington Square (east side and Hart Street. part of south side). High Holborn. Vernon Place. Little Earl Street. 54 Main Roads, By the Local Government (England and Wales) Act, 1888, which constituted the London County Council, it was provided that every road in a County, which is for the time being a main road within the meaning of the Highways and Locomotives (Amendment) Act, 1878, should be wholly maintained and repaired by the County Council and charged to the General County Account, and the Act provided that any Local Authority might claim to retain the powers and duties of maintaining such main roads, the County Council making the Local Authority an annual payment for their maintenance and repair. Your Board accordingly made application in November, 1889, to the London County Council, for a contribution towards the cost of maintaining and repairing certain roads in the District, which, in your opinion, were main roads within the meaning of the Act, the said roads being as follows:— Feet. Feet. Tottenham Court Road ... 1,186 High Holborn ... 1,608 New Oxford Street 1,715 Broad Street 466 Shaftesbury Avenue 1,465 Charing Cross Road 800 Cambridge Circus - High Street 821 Great St. Andrew Street 412 Seven Dials 93 Little St. Andrew Street to Boundary of District 346 - 851 Great Queen Street 930 Little Queen Street 474 55  Feet.

Sewers. The following works in connection with the Public Sewers were performed during the year:— Compton Street, from Hunter Street to boundary of District ... 98 feet lineal of new brick sewer,4 ft. by 2 ft. 8 in. internal dimensions. Kemble Street, from Stanhope Street to Great Wild Street 49 feet lineal of new brick sewer, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. internal dimensions. Little Coram Street, from Great Coram Street to boundary of District 334 feet lineal old sewer underpinned and repaired. Nottingham Court, at juuction with Shorts Gardens 6 feet lineal old sewer underpinned and repaired. Caroline Street New side entrance constructed. Broad Street ditto ditto Vine Street (north end) ditto ditto Neal Street ditto ditto Theobalds Road Connection made between the old sewers in Theobalds Road and Southampton Row. 56 Old Sewers, Sardinia Place, &c. The Metropolitan Electric Supply Company (Limited), recently erected a new electric light station in Sardinia Place, the drains from which were connected with the public sewer in Sardinia Place. Shortly after the Company commenced operations they discharged considerable quantities of hot water into the sewer, giving rise to complaints from the inhabitants of the adjacent premises, of steam and smell finding their way from the sewers into their properties, and upon investigating the matter, it was found that a number of old sewers and drains ran beneath the private property situated between the north end of Sardinia Place and the south side of Great Queen Street, these drains being in a most defective condition. The matter was referred to your Sanitary Committee for consideration and report, and, upon its recommendation, the Board ordered that these old sewers should be filled up, new stoneware pipes being laid where necessary to take any sewage that might be found to enter them. These works were performed by the Board's workmen, under my direction—they were of an expensive and difficult character, a considerable length of the old sewers running as they did beneath the walls of premises, the said walls being actually built upon them. The matter was reported on at length by me on the 3rd June, 1890, and the total cost of the work, which included certain works in connection with the drainage of the several properties beneath which the old sewers ran, was £139 l1s. 1d. Sewers, Charing Cross Road. In the Autumn of 1889, complaint was made by the inhabitants of premises abutting upon Charing Cross Road 57 (but not within the St. Giles' District) of smells arising from the public sewers. Upon examination it was discovered that when the late Metropolitan Board of Works formed the new Charing Cross Road, the old sewer, which ran along the centre of Crown Street and took the drainage of the houses in that street, was not done away with, but was left to take the drainage of the houses on the west side of the new road. This sewer terminated with a head wall at a point near to Falconberg Court, a few yards south of Oxford Street, the flow of sewage in it was very slight, being only that which came from the houses on the west side of Charing Cross Road, and a quantity of deposit had consequently accumulated in it. Certain of these premises discharged considerable quantities of hot water into the sewer, which so raised its temperature, that the sewer was at all times so hot and full of steam as to prevent men entering it fur cleansing purposes. The matter was referred to your Works Committee, who gave it much consideration, and, on its recommendation your Board ordered the construction of a short length of brick sewer to connect the new Charing Cross Road sewer with the old ( rown Street sewer, for the purpose of giving access to it and for cleansing the latter and to assist its ventilation, and also the construction of a flushing tank at the head of the old sewer, constructed so as to discharge automatically, at regular intervals, a considerable body of water, and thus prevent accumulation of deposit again occurring, and also to lower the temperature of the sewer. The work was carried out by the Board's own workmen, under my direction, at a cost of £126 8s., it was completed on the 25th March last, and no further complaints of smell have been made. 58 Street Cleansing, The cleansing of the public ways was performed by a staff of men employed by the Board, consisting of 1 foreman, 3 gangers, and 31 sweepers. Two sweeping machines, drawn by horses were also used in sweeping the carriage-ways. The street sweepings were carted away by contract, and amounted to a total of 6,348 van loads, equal to over 20,000 cubic yards. The carriage-ways of the main thoroughfares that are paved with wood and asphalte were washed frequently during the year by means of watering-carts and the machine brooms, the cost of which washing is included in the two items of cost for street cleansing and street watering given hereafter. The following streets being market streets, and streets inhabited by the poorer classes, were cleansed on Sundays between the hours of 6 and 10 a.m., those streets in the list which are printed in Italics being cleansed a second time, between 12 noon and 2.30 p.m. After the second cleansing the streets were watered with permanganate of potash and water:— Abbey Place. Arthur Street. Bainbridge Street. Castle Street. Colonnade. Kenton Street. Little Coram Street and Courts adjacent. Little Guilford Street. Marchmont Street. Arthur Street. Castle Street. Church Passage. Drury Lane. Dyott Street. Goldsmith Street. Great Earl Street. Great Wild Street. Little Earl Street. Little White Lion Street. Little Wild Street. Lloyd's Court. Lumber Court. Macklin Street. Neal Street. Newton Street. Parker Street. Phoenix Street. Queen Street. Seven Dials. Shelton Street. Short's Gardens. Smart's Buildings. Stacey Street. Tower Street. 59 The following main thoroughfares were also cleansed on Sundays between 6 and 10 a.m., viz. :— Bloomsbury Square (south side). Broad Street (between Bloomsbury Street, High Street, and Great St. Andrew Street). Bury Street. Charing Cross Road. Endell Street. Great Queen Street. Great St. Andrew Street. Hart Street. High Ilolborn. High Street. Little Queen Street. Little St. Andrew Street. New Compton Street. New Oxford Street. Shaftesbury Avenue. Southampton Row (from Bloomsbury Place to High Holborn). Theobald's Road. Tottenham Court Road. Vernon Place. The main thoroughfares in the district were also watered twice on Sundays during the summer months between the hours of 7 a.m. and 1 p.m., when the condition of the weather rendered it desirable. The cost of the foregoing works is included in the lump sum contracts for cleansing and street watering. The question of cleansing the whole of the public footways in the District was again considered by your Board. It had, since 187 9, been the custom to do so during wet and sloppy weather, 16 boys and 1 man as ganger beiug employed to do this work, their time in dry weather being occupied in collecting horse droppings from the surfaces of the several wood and asphalte pavements in the District. Considerable attention was given to the matter by you, and it was ultimately decided to continue the present system as above described, and in addition, in the event of a snowfall, to clear the snow from the whole of the footways in the District, this work being considered by you almost, if not quite as necessary as the cleansing of the carriageways, and one which should be undertaken by the Local 60 authorities rather than be left to the inhabitants, a large number of whom failed to perform it. It is believed that this is the only District in London where such work is undertaken by the Local authorities. Snow. No heavy snowfall has occurred during the winter, the greatest fall being on the 7th December, 1889, when it measured about an inch in depth. A number of extra men were employed to assist the Board's regular staff of men in clearing the snow from the public footways and carriageways, the total additional cost incurred, being £38 18s. 7d. Ballasting Carriage-ways. The question of ballasting the asphalte carriage-ways and more frequently cleansing them, when under certain atmospheric conditions they become greasy, was also considered by you, and your Board ultimately authorized me to employ the Street Orderly Boys for this purpose, and also such additional labour as I considered necessary when the condition of the public ways rendered it advisable. This has since been done on several occasions with satisfactory results. Street-orderly Bins. Eleven new street orderly bins for the reception of the horse droppings gathered by the street-orderly boys, were erected during the year in various streets in the District. The number of bins now number 30, and are situated as follows :— 61 Bedford Place 2 Bloomsbury Square 2 Bloomsbury Street 1 Charlotte Street 2 Hart Street 2 High Holborn 4 High Street 1 Hunter Street 3 Little Queen Street 1 Montague Street 3 Museum Street 1 New Oxford Street 3 Russell Square (east side) 3 Southampton Row 2 Total 30 Cost of Street Cleansing. The total cost of street cleansing for the year 1889-90 was as follows:— £ s. d. Wages of men and boys 2,237 6 3 Brooms, scrapers, shovels, &c., and clothing for men and boys 439 12 1 Cartage of slop and street sweepings, and hire of horses for street-sweeping machines 3,050 8 4 Removal of snow, additional labour, &c. 38 18 7 Total £5,766 5 3 Street Watering. The street watering was performed by contract, the contractor supplying all carts, horses and drivers required, at a fixed price for the whole work for the year. A small hand water-cart was employed to water those courts and alleys in 62 the District which were too narrow for the vans drawn by horses to enter. The water used for this purpose (including the washing) amounted to 4,039,000 gallons. A small quantity of permanganate of potash was added to the contents of the watering-carts during the hot summer months. £ s. d. The amount paid for water, meter-hire, repairs to stand posts, &c., was 241 12 2 To Contractor for horses, carts, and men 900 0 0 Permanganate of potash 27 0 0 Total £1,168 12 2 Removal of Dust. The dust and ashes were removed from the houses in the District by contract, the contractor providing ail necessary carts, horses, and men, and performing the whole work at a cost of £2,960 8s. 4d. The disinfection of the dust-bins in the District with carbolic acid powder, after their contents had been removed by the contractor's dustmen, was continued during the year, the cost of the disinfectant being £9. New Dust Vans. Complaints had frequently been made to the Board, of dust and rubbish being blown from the tops of the dustcarts, which were uncovered, on to the public way, and negotiations were entered into with the Board's contractor with the view to his substituting new covered dust-vans in place of the old-fashioned uncovered carts. After some correspondence, the contractor, Mr. Cookson, offered to provide new dust vans, with light iron covers of a pattern to lie approved by your Board, at his own expense, if the 63 Board would extend the contract which had been entered into with him, for one year from Lady-Day, 1889, to three years, he stating that the expense of providing these new vans would be too great to be met out of a single year's contract. Your Board thought this a reasonable proposition, and assented to the same, and a contract for the extension of the existing contract to three years was accordingly entered into. The new covered vans have since been provided, and have been generally approved of. Limewhiting Courts. The work of cleansing and limewhiting the entrances to the yards, courts, mews, &c., which had been previously performed by a workman employed by the Board, was let by competition, the lowest tender being £39, which was accepted, and the walls to the following places in the District were twice cleansed and limewhited during the year :— Bernard Mews Betterton Court. Brunswick Mews. Caroline Mews. Clarke's Buildings Clarke's Mews. Colonnade. Compton Mews. Cottage PlaceDemnark Place. Dunn's Passage. Feathers Court. Hall's Yard. Henrietta Mews. Hunter Mews.

Queen's Head Yard. Sardinia Place. Sardinia Street. Shelton Street. Silver Street. Southampton Mews. Tavistock Mews. Titchbourne Court. Woburn Mews. 64 Public Urinals. The public urinals in the District belonging to the Board are 17 in number, and contain 50 compartments ; 12 of the urinals, containing 42 compartments, have water laid on to them ; the others are without water supply. The whole are cleansed daily by the Board's workmen. LIST OF PUBLIC URINALS IN THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Bainbridge Street 5 compartments, fitted with water supply. Chenies Mews, north 3 do. do. do.

The re-arrangement of the public lamps and the substitution of new lamp posts and circular lamps for those of the old patterns, were proceeded with during the year ; the total number of the new lamp posts and lanterns in the District is 868 ; of the old pattern square lamps, 183. There are also 59 lamps of larger size at the corners of certain streets and on the public crossing refuges, making a total of 1110 public lamps in the District, belonging to your Board. 65 Lighting of Public Lamps during Dark and Foggy Days. In accordance with arrangements entered into with the Gas Light and Coke Company in the previous year, for the lighting of the public lamps during dark and foggy days, the lamps in the main public ways within the District were lighted on seven occasions during the winter, the cost of the same amounting to £7 6s. 7d. Names on Public Lamps. The question of affixing the names of streets on public lamps, which had been at various times before your Board, was again taken into consideration, and it was ultimately resolved to have the names in 1½ inch enamelled letters attached to the glass on certain public lamps in the District, particularly at junctions of different streets, which work has been carried out at a cost of £49 3s. 6d. Electric Lighting. Under the Provisional Orders granted by the Board of Trade, and which were confirmed by Act of Parliament on 2Gth August, 1889, the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, has commenced laying mains in connection with their station in Sardinia Street, to supply electricity within the District. The following is a list of the streets in which the mains have been laid up to the date of this report, and the Company is proceeding rapidly with their extension. r 66 Bayley Street. Bedford Place. Bedford Square. Bloomsbury Square. Broad Street. Caroline Street Drury Lane. Gate Street. George Yard. Goldsmith Street. Great Queen Street. Great Russell Street. Great Wild Street. Hart Street.

Southampton Row. Stanhope Street. Theobald's Road. * Tottenham Court Road. Vernon Place. Street Refuges. One additional street-crossing refuge has been formed during the year in New Oxford Street, at the junction with Charing Cross Road, and one of the refuges which had been formed by the Metropolitan Board of Works when they constructed Shaftesbury Avenue being considered by your Board not to be in a convenient position, was removed and refixed in Shaftesbury Avenue, east of Bloomsbury Street. The following is a list of the refuges now existing within the St. Giles District :— In Bloomsbury Street south side of Shaftesbury A venue.

TO THE BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE ST. GILES DISTRICT. Gentlemen, I herewith present my Annual Report of the district for the past year, ending 31st December, 1889. The vital statistics are calculated upon the corrected population of the Census, 1881, and they are arranged in order to be of use for comparison with the corresponding reports of past years. I will first, however, lay before you some interesting extracts from the Registrar-General's Annual Summary of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in London, during 1889, as follows :— Registration London." "Area.—The area of Registration London is 77,410 acres, or 121 square miles, including 2,718 acres of tidal water. The length of the streets and roads, as returned in 1882, was more than 1,600 miles. The area of London being 121 square miles, is equal to a square of 11 miles to the side. " Elevation.—The population of London resides at a * Registration London is co-extensive with the Administrative County of London 72 mean elevation of 39 feet above Trinity high-water mark, the elevation varying from 11 feet below high-water mark in Plumstead Marshes to 429 feet above high-water mark in Hampstead “ Houses.—At the Census in 1881 there were within this area 486,05(3 inhabited houses, containing an average of 7'9 persons to a house, closely corresponding with the proportions in 1861 and 1871. " Annual Rateable Value.—The annua] rateable value of property within Registration London in 1 889, as assessed in accordance with the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869, was £31,450,002.* "Density (1889).—58.3 persons to an acre ; 37,288 to a square mile. " Annual Rate of Increase of Population per cent.: 1861-71, 1.50 ; 1871-81, 1 "61. "1889. " Population (Estimated to the middle of the yeaf). Males 2,049,580 Persons 4,351,738 Females 2,302,158 " Marriages 35,484 " Persons Married 70,968 "Annual Eate of persons married per 1,000 of the Population, 16.3. "Births.— Males 67,067 Persons 131,487 Females 64,420 " Annual Rate of Births per 1,000 of the Population, 30'3. " Deaths.— Males 38,749 Persons 75,683 Females 36,934 " Annual Rate of Mortality per 1,000 Males 19.0 - Persons, 17.4 Females 16.1 "Excess of Registered Births over Deaths 55,804 "Estimated Increase of Population 69,370." * From the Return issued by the London County Council. 73 The Health of London in 1889. "The Registrar-General, in his last Annual Summary, reported that the death rate in Registration London in 1888 was 18.5 per 1,000, being ' far the lowest death-rate as yet recorded in London,' the next lowest being 19.8, 19.9, and 19.6 in the three immediately preceding years, 1885-86-87, previously to which the London death-rate had never fallen below 20 per 1,000. The death-rate in 1889, moreover, again fell, and was considerably below the low rate in 1888. The mean annual death-rate in London in the fifty-two weeks of last year did not exceed 17.5 per 1,000, and was 1 per 1,000 below the rate in 1888, and far lower than the rate recorded in London in any year since Civil Registration first afforded the means for calculating trustworthy rates. " The annual number of births in London has, on the whole, remained stationary since 1881, notwithstanding an estimated increase of about half a million in the population since that year, suggesting either that the population has not increased, or that the birth-rate has declined. "On the whole, no sufficient reason can be urged for doubting that the Metropolitan death-rate in 1889 was unprecedentedly low, compared not only with the death-rates in London in past years, but with the rates of any of the other large cities of the world. " The deaths registered in the fifty-two weeks of last year were 75,683, and actually fewer than in any year since 1870, when the population of the Metropolitan area was less by about a million than it is believed to be now. " The deaths from the principal zymotic diseases were last year 9,709, more than 1,000 fewer than in any previous year on record back to 1870, and equal to a death-rate of 74 22 per 1,000; this rate was scarcely more than half the mean annual rate from these diseases in the ten years1870-9. " Infant mortality, too, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year to registered births, did not exceed 141 per 1,000 during last year, a lower rate than in any previous year of which record exists, while the mean rate in the four years 1870-73, was 163 per 1,000. " It would appear from these facts that the health of London in 1889 was unprecedentedly good, and that its improvement in recent years has more than kept pace with the undoubted general improvement in the sanitary condition of the whole country, judged by its mortality statistics." Meteorological Summary, The remarks upon the meteorology of the four quarters of the year, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and at the various other stations, are taken from the observations of Mr. James Glaisher, F.R.S.

The mean reading of the barometer was 29.858 inches, and was .111 above the mean reading for the corresponding periods of 48 years. The mean temperature of the air during the quarter was 43°.5, and was 0o.2 below the average for the corresponding quarters of 118 years. The amount of rain measured during the quarter was 6.15 inches, and was 0.95 below the average amount in the corresponding periods of 74 years. 77 The amount of bright sunshine recorded during the quarter was 129.4 hours, and was 6'0 hours below the average amount recorded in the corresponding periods of the ten years, 1879-88. Metropolitan Water Supply. The following particulars are taken from the report to the Registrar-General on the analysis of the water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Companies during the several months of the year 1889 by Professor Frankland, D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.S.:—"During the year I have examined and analysed 120 samples of water supplied by the eight Metropolitan Water Companies, the Colne Valley Water Company and the Tottenham Local Board of Health. "The weather during the past year has, on the whole, been favourable for the operations of those companies which derive their supplies from rivers, and as the increased efficiency of subsidence and filtration observed for several years past has been fully maintained, the water delivered by these companies has been, on the average, of even better quality than that delivered during the year 1888. "The total amount of solid matters found in 100,000 parts by weight of the various waters were:— Companies or Local Authorities. 1889 Mean of 12 Months. Inner Circle Thames Chelsea 28.52 West Middlesex 29.44 Southwark 30.16 Grand Junction 29.56 Lambeth 30.30 Lea *New River 30.71 East London 33.86 Deep Wells Kent 42.43 Outer Circle Colne Valley 17.98 Tottenham Local Board 44.45 * The water supplied to the whole of St. Giles District is from the mains of the New River Company. 78 "These solid matters are almost wholly composed of mineral substances, which, in these proportions, in no way diminish the fitness of water for drinking. But the salts of lime and magnesia which constitute the principal part of these mineral ingredients are objectionable, not only because they impart to the water what is known as "hardness," and thus render it unsuitable for washing, but also because they cause incrustations and deposits in steam and kitchen boilers and hot water pipes. The small proportion of organic material which the solid matter invariably contains is on the other hand of the greatest importance in connexion with the use of the water for drinking purposes. For, although the actual amount of this organic matter is generally quite insignificant, yet it may be of the most objectionable character on account of its origin. "The following table shows the proportional amount of organic elements (organic carbon and organic nitrogen) in each of the waters:— Sources. Maximum. Minimum. Average. Deep Wells. Kent 11 0.4 0.7 Colne Vally 1.6 1.2 1.4 Tottenham 1.7 0.5 1.3 River Lea. New River 2.1 0.6 1.5 East London 3.5 1.2 2.7 River Thames. Chelsea 5.1 1.4 3.2 West Middlesex 5.1 1.6 2.9 Southwark 50 1.6 2.7 Grand Junction 52 1.5 2.5 Lambeth 4.2 1.6 2.5 "Thus, of the Deep Well waters, that supplied by the Kent Company contained least organic matter, whilst of the river waters, that supplied by the New River Company was the best in this respect, the East London Company's water ranking with the best of the Thames Waters" 79 The St, Giles District. The district of St. Giles, comprising the two parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields and St. George, Bloomsbury, has an area of 245 statute acres. For Registration purposes it forms one of the Central Districts of the Metropolis, and is divided into three subdistricts, viz.— St. George, Bloomsbury. St. Giles, South. St. Giles, North. The corrected returns of the Census 1881 of the estimated population for the two parishes were:— St. George, Bloomsbury 16,681 St. Giles-in-the-Fields 28,701 Total inhabitants 45,382 The number of inhabited houses, 3,968. The number of persona living in each house, 11.4. The density of population to the acre, 185. The elevation of the District, 68 feet above Trinity high-water mark. The Rateable value (quinquennial assessment):— Gross value £458,121 Rateable value 382,491 Lincoln's Inn is assessed separately at— Gross£25,305 Rateable 21,149 Marriages and Marriage-rate. Population (Census 1881). Marriage-rate per 1,000 1889. Average Marriagerate per 1,000 for ten years 1879-88. St. Giles District 45,382 14.1 14.7 80 In 1889 there were 322 marriages in the District, corresponding to a marriage rate of 14.1 per 1,000 for the year; this rate showed a decrease of 1.0 upon that recorded for 1888, but identical with that of thedecennial average 1879-88. Of the 322 marriages, 200 were solemnized in the three parish churches, 78 in Nonconformist places of worship, and 44 in the Superintendent Registrar's office, as follows:— Name of Building. Denomination, &c. Number of M arriages. Parish Church, St. Giles-in-the-Fields Established Church. 82 Parish Church, St. George, Bloomsbury ditto 97 Holy Trinity Church, Little Queen Street ditto 21 Sardinian Chapel, Sardinia Street Roman Catholic 27 Bloomsbury Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Baptist 7 Little Wild Street Chapel ditto 1 Kingsgate Chapel, Kingsgate Street ditto 2 Keppel Street Chapel ditto ... Great Queen Street Chapel Wesleyan Methodist 3 Eglise Suisse, Endell Street Swiss Reformed 2 Church Bedford Chapel, Bloomsbury Street Unitarian 2 Superintendent Registrar's Office, Broad Street 78 Total number of marriages 322 The marriages registered in London numbered 35,484,giving a proportion of 16.3 persons married to 1,000 of the population; this was a rate slightly higher than it had been in the preceding year, when it was the lowest on record. In England and Wales the number of marriages registered was 427,392, viz., 81,926 in the first quarter of the year, 111,372 in the second, 107,542 in the third, and 126,552 in the fourth. The marriage rate per 1,000 of the estimated population was 14.7, and corresponded with the mean rate in the ten preceding years 1879-88. 81 Births and Birth-rate. Registration Sub-Districts.

The annual birth-rate for the whole district was equal to 26.3 per 1,000, a rate of 0.6 lower than that of the preceding year, but,again, 2.0 per 1,000 below the rale for the decennial average. The birth-rate for the whole parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, 22.2 per 1,000, showed a rate 2.8 higher than that of the preceding year, but corresponds to the average birth-rate for the ten years 1879-88. The birth-rate for the whole parish of St. Giles-in-theFields, 28.7, was again higher than the rate for the whole of the district. The same disproportions were shown in the two divisions of the parish, for while the rate was as high as 40.3 in St. Giles, South, it was only 16.3 in St. Giles, North, but it must be borne in mind the high rate of the former is largely due to the number of births in the British Lying-in Hospital, the Workhouse, and the Peabody Buildings situate in the southern part of the parish. G 82 The births registered in London numbered 131,487, and were in proportion of 30.3 per 1,000 inhabitants. The birth-rate in London has fallen continuously year after year since 1876. The birth-rate for the last year being the lowest on record, The excess of births over deaths was 55,804. The decline in the birth-rate was more than compensated by the still greater decline of mortality. During the four quarters of 1889, 885,160 births were registered in England and Wales. The natural increase of population during the year by excess of births over deaths was 367,224. The birth-rate was equal to 30.5 per 1,000 of the population. Deaths and Death-rate, Registration Sub-Districts. Population (Census 1881). Registered Deaths (corrected). Ratio of Deaths to Population.

St. George, Bloomsbury 16,681 249 1 in 66.9 14.9 16.1 St. Giles, South 14,864 489 1 in 30.3 32.8 33.0 St. Giles, North 13,837 166 1 in 83.3 11.9 20.2 St. Giles District 45,382 904 1 in 50.2 19.9 23.3 The deaths registered in the three sub-districts were:— St. George, Bloomsbury 199 St. Giles, South 364 St. Giles, North 135 Total 698 Of these 359 were males, and 339 females. This number must be corrected by adding 233 deaths of 83 parishioners, which occurred in the General Hospitals and Public Institutions situated outside the district, and by deducting 27 deaths of non-parishioners, residents of the Strand Union and other metropolitan parishes, who died in the Workhouse, Broad Street. These alterations increased the total number of deaths to 904. The necessary corrections for the whole district and the registration sub-districts will be seen in the table above. The death-rate of St. Giles district for the year 1889 was therefore equal to 19.9 per 1,000 of the population, a rate of 1.2 per 1,000 higher than that of the precedingyear,but 34 perl,000 lower than the average rate for the last ten years. The death-rate for the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields was 22.8 per 1,000,almost identical with the rate for the year 1888. The death-rate for the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, was as low as 14.9 per 1,000, and 1.2 per 1,000 lower than that of the decennial average. There was again the same remarkable difference in the rates for the two divisions of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, for whilst it was as high as 32.8 per 1,000 in the southern part, it was only 11.9 in the north. The senile mortality at the Workhouse and the Cleveland Street Sick Asylum largely account for the high mortality in St. Giles, South. The deaths registered in London in 1889 numbered 75,683, and corresponded to an annual rate of 17.4per 1,000. The Registrar-General states:—"This is by far the lowest death-rate as yet recorded in London, the four next lowest rates are those in the four immediately preceding years, 1885-6-7-8, when the figures were respectively, 19.8, 19.9, 19.6 and 18.5." G 2 84 In England and Wales 517,936 deaths were registered during 1889. The death-rate was equal to 17.9 per 1,000. Infantile Mortality. 176 infants died under one year of age, or 14.7 per 1,000 of registered births, and 19.4 per 1,000 of total deaths. 296 children died before they reached 5 years of age ; it will therefore be seen that the large number of 32.7 percent. of total deaths occur in the first five years of life. The infantile mortality shows a further decline in the rate of the previous year. The chief causes of death can be seen by consulting Table III. of the Appendix. This table shows that 56 of the total deaths under one year of age were due to zymotic and tubercular diseases, 63 were from local diseases, chiefly affecting the respiratory organs, 26 from general debility, and 9 from accidental or wilful causes, 8 of the 9 being from suffocation. It is on the authority of Dr. Danford Thomas that as many as 200 infants are suffocated annually in the central coroner's division of Middlesex alone, and that the great majority of these are overlaid by their parents. Prevention is the best remedy, and with this object every parent and nurse should be taught the urgent necessity of allowing infants the comfort and security of a separate sleeping crib. Deaths of Old People. At 65 years and upwards there were 153 deaths against 228, 204 and 159 in the three preceding years, or 16.9 per cent. on total deaths. 10 of the deaths registered from old age occurred at 85 years and upwards, and 1 was returned at the advanced age of 91. 85 Uncertified Deaths. The causes of 801, or 11 per cent. of the registered deaths in Registration London, were not certified either by a registered medical practitioner or a coroner. In the four preceding years the proportion ranged from 1.3 to 1.0 per cent. In England and Wales the proportion has steadily declined from 4.7 in 1879 to 2-9 in 1889. In this district only 3 deaths were returned by the Registrars as uncertified; in each case the coroner considered an inquest unnecessary. Inquests, There were 73 inquests held on parishioners. 44 at the Coroner's Court, Goldsmith Street, 11 at other convenient places appointed by the Coroner, and 18 at public hospitals and institutions outside the district, where the deceased had been removed for treatment. 60 of the deaths occurred to parishioners of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, and 13 to parishioners of St. George, Bloomsbury. 42 died from disease or natural causes, 22 resulted from different kinds of violence, 7 committed suicide, and 2 were homicidal. The inquest cases in St. Giles were in proportion of 8'0 per cent. of the total deaths from all causes. In London the deaths from violence were considerably below the corrected decennial average, a quarter of the whole were deaths of infants under one year of age from suffocation. In England and Wales inquests were held in 29,079 cases, or 5.6 per cent. of the total deaths. The reported deaths from different kinds of violence were 17,038, or 3.3 per cent. of the total deaths. 86 In St. Giles District the several causes of death as returned by the Coroner may be classified as follows :— Causes of Death. St. George, Bloomsbury. St. Giles, South. St. Giles, North Whole District. From natural causes. Diseases of brain and nervous system l 5 - 6 Diseases of heart and circulatory system- 5 12 2 19 Diseases of lungs and respiratory system 1 7 — 8 Other diseases — 7 2 9 From accidenta causes Fractures, falls, contusions 1 5 — 6 Burn, scald 1 3 — 4 Hydrophobia from bite of dog — — 1 1 Suffocation 3 5 1 9 Poison (chloroform) — — 1 1 Poison (septic from illegal operation) — — 1 1 From suicidal causes. Hanging — — 2 2 Drowning — 1 — 1 Cut throat — — 1 1 Fractures, falls, contusions 1 1 — 2 Poison (carbolic acid) — 1 — 1 Manslaughter (pistol shot) — — 1 1 Murder (exposure of newly born infant) — 1 — 1 Total 13 48 12 73 The Mortuary. 67 bodies were admitted to the Public Mortuary, Goldsmith Street. 45 by order of the Coroner, 18 at the request of the relatives of the deceased, 4 were brought in by the police. One death, due to infectious disease, was received in the chamber set apart for the purpose. In 29 of the cases post-mortem examinations were made. Since the opening of the Mortuary in 1883, 557 bodies have been received, 288 post-mortem examinations made, and 451 inquests held in the Coroner's Court attached to the building. 87 The Royal Commission on the housing of the working classes recommended that "in the event of a death from infectious disease the body should forthwith be removed to a mortuary in cases where it would otherwise be retained in a room used as a dwelling by others," and they thought it desirable "that in any case where the body lies in a room which is used by other persons it should in the same manner be removed." Seeing that from a total number of deaths of 904 for the whole district during the year only 67 bodies were conveyed to the Mortuary, it is to be regretted that so little use is made of the building by the parishioners for the reception of their dead. Deaths in Public Institutions (Within the District). The Workhouse, Broad Street. 135 deaths occurred in this Institution, and 80 who were removed from it at the Central Sick Asylum, Cleveland Street, a total of 215 pauper deaths; 27 of these were parishioners of the Strand Union. The number of inmates averaging 681 during the year, the 215 deaths equal a rate of 31.5 per 1,000. 103 of the deaths were those of very old people, viz., 80 were stated to be between 65 and 75 years of age, 20 were stated to be between 75 and 85 years of age, and 3 above 85 years. I have again to acknowledge the kindness of the officers of the Guardians for information and statistics supplied to me relative to the Workhouse. 88 The British Lying-in Hospital, Endell Street. The hygienic condition of this lying-in hospital during the past year has been most satisfactory; there has again been an entire absence of puerperal fever from the wards. The medical staff report that 148 women were delivered in the Hospital, of these all recovered with one exception, who died from Bright's disease. 149 children were born, of whom 6 were stillborn. In the out-patient department there were 600 deliveries, with one maternal death from heart disease and bronchitis. Deaths in Public Institutions. (Outside the District.) I receive by arrangement from the office of the RegistrarGeneral a weekly return of the deaths of parishioners belonging to St. Giles district occurring in the general hospitals in the metropolitan area. It will be seen from the table below that no less than 233 of our total deaths (904) occurred outside the district. Public Institutions. Number of Deaths. Public Institutions. Number of Deaths.

Model Buildings tenanted by the Working Classes. I.—Buildings belonging to the Peabody Donation Fund. Secretary, Mr. J. Crouch, 64, Queen St., Cheapside, E.C. A.—THE GREAT WILD STREET BLOCK. Resident Superintendent, Mr. Manship. In 1889 this block was occupied by 1,435 persons, 13 more than in the previous year; of these 269 were children under 5 years of age. There were 67 births, corresponding to the high rate of 46.6 per 1,000, and a rate 20.3 higher than that of the whole district. The 23 deaths included 8 at King's College, and one at the Children's Hospital, and equalled a rate of 16.0 per 1,000 inhabitants of the buildings. There were 7 deaths from zymotic diseases, viz., diphtheria 4, measles 1, and diarrhoea 2, or a zymotic rate of 4.8 per 1,000. The 15 deaths of children under 5 years of age equalled an infantile death-rate of 10.4 per 1,000. The following table carried forward from last year shows the several rates for the seven years 1883-9. Great Wild Street Block. 1883. 1884. 1885. 1886. 1887. 1888. 1889.

Resident Superintendent, Mr. Whenman. This block was tenanted by 844 persons, 161 being children under 5 years. There were 41 births, equal to a birth-rate of 48.5 per 1,000. There were 15 deaths, including 4 who were removed to hospitals. The death-rate was equal to a death-rate of 17.7 per 1,000. There were 6 deaths from zymotic diseases, viz., measles 1, whooping cough 2, scarlet fever 2, and diphtheria 1, and the rate was 7.1 per 1,000. 12 of the total deaths occurred to children under 5 years of age, and the rate equalled 14.2 per 1,000. The following table shows these several rates for the last five years:— Little Coram Street Block. 1885. 1886. 1887. 1888. 1889. Average for five years 1885-9.

The total fund on 31st December last was £994,789 19s. 9d. The balance unpaid of monies borrowed of the Public Loan Commissioners and others was £241,333 6s. 8d. The Trustees have expended on land and buildings to the end of the year a total expenditure of £1,233,845 17s. 8d. A total of 11,275 rooms have been provided in the several blocks of buildings belonging to the Fund for the artizan and 92 labouring poor of London. The average rent of each dwelling was 4s. 9¼d. per week, and of each room 2s. 11/3d. The birth-rate for the year reached 39.0 per 1,000, and the death-rate was 16.4 per 1,000. II.—Buildings belonging to the Incorporated Society for Improving the Condition of the Working Classes. Secretary, Mr. Humphreys, 8, Southampton Row, W.C. THE MODEL HOUSES, STREATHAM STREET. Resident Superintendent, Mr. Davey. This block was occupied by 55 families, consisting of 230 persons, 64 of whom were children under 10 years of age. The births numbered 6 during the year, and corresponded to a birth-rate of 26.0 per 1,000. The 3 deaths, 2 adults and 1 child, were equal to a death-rate of 13.0 per 1,000. Again this year there was no zymotic death in the buildings. III.—Buildings belonging to the Central London Dwellings Improvement Company. Secretary, Miss Cons, Surrey Lodge, Kennington Road, S. And the Office, 9, Granby Place, Drury Lane, W.C. THE THURSTON AND HOLLAND MODEL DWELLINGS, NEWTON STREET. Resident Superintendent, Mr. Christie. These buildings were tenanted by 224 people. Holland Buildings—78 adults and 14 children under 5 years of age. Thurston Buildings—105 adults and 27 children under 5 years of age. There were 8 births, corresponding to a birth-rate of 35.7 per 1,000. 9 deaths, 8 of which occurred in the Thurston Block. And the rate was equal to 40.1 per 1,000. There were 6 infantile deaths, including 2 from diarrhœa. 93 Zymotic Diseases, In England and Wales, during the four quarters of the year, 61,027 deaths were referred to the seven principal zymotic diseases, exceeding by 8,454 the number recorded in the preceding year; these deaths corresponded to an annual rate of 2.l per 1,000, against 23 and 1.8 in the two preceding years. "In London the deaths were 9,709, while the corrected decennial average would have been 13,537, so that altogether there was a saving of 3,828 lives" (RegistrarGeneral). The zymotic death-rate for Registration London was 2.2 per 1,000, against 2.53, the rate for the preceding year. In St. Giles District there was 114 deaths, equal to a rate of 2.5 per 1,000, and 0.3 higher than the Metropolitan rate. 1. Small-Pox (decennial average 5.4).—No parishioner of St.. Giles District has died from small-pox since 1 885, and during the past year no case of sickness was reported from it. "During the year, 25 persons certified to be suffering from small-pox were removed from different parts of the Metropolis to the Asylums Board Hospitals. Those cases in which the diagnosis was confirmed by a Medical Superintendent in London were conveyed to the Hospital Ships. Of the above number no fewer than 20 persons were found not to have the disease, and were accordingly taken back to their homes. "Of the five patients admitted, three contracted the disease abroad" (Metropolitan Asylums Board Report). "Only one death was ascribed to it in all London, and this, 94 with the numbers 24, 9, 9 fur the three preceding years, are the lowest on record since civil registration was instituted" (Registrar- General). 2. Measles (decennial average 28.1)—There were no less than 41 deaths from this infantile disease in 1.89; of these 7 were infants under 1 year, 31 were children between I and 5 years, and 3 just above 5 years of age. This District shared the serious outbreak with the whole of the Metropolis and various parts of the country. It commenced in the Autumn of 1888, and the mortality was excessive until May, 1889, when the epidemic ceased. In the Southern parts of London, its severity had been especially felt, and many children died suddenly from it. In Battersea and Wandsworth no fewer than 700 children were absent from the various schools in the neighbourhood; and the mortality which prevailed from it in these parishes was so heavy that the Vestry of Battersea communicated with the managers of the Asylums Board as to the propriety of admitting cases into their hospitals. In the discussion which followed, the managers considered that they were not empowered to accept such cases without additional powers being given by Parliament for the purpose. Measles is not reported to the Local Sanitary Authorities under the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889, and cases are but rarely received into the wards of the General Hospitals. 3. Scarlet Fever (decennial average 18.0).—Throughout the Metropolis the mortality from scarlet fever was considerably below the average in every week of the year. St. Giles District shared this immunity, for only 4 deaths (children under 5 years of age) were recorded. 41 patients were removed to the hospitals of the Asylums Board; of these, 14 were admitted to the Western Fever Hospital 95 from the Boys' Home, Shaftesbury Avenue, where a sudden but mild outbreak of the disease occurred between the end of January and the 14th of the following month. During the year 1889, the number of scarlet fever patients in the several hospitals of the Asylums Board amounted in the aggregate to 5,260, of whom 366 died, a mortality of 6.9 per cent. "The past year showed a further advance in the increasing tendency of Londoners to make use of the public hospitals in cases of scarlet fever, for, in 1878, only 7 per cent. of the total deaths from this disease occurred in the London Fever and Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals, from which date the proportion rose year by year, until in 1888 it had reached 43 4 per cent.; again, in 1889, to rise further to 48.9 per cent., or practically one half of the whole" (RegistrarGeneral). 4. Diphtheria (decennial average 12.9).—The 17 deaths from this disease in 1889, 15 children and 2 adults, showed an increase of 6 over the number reported for the preceding year. In the whole Metropolis, the deaths of 1,588 were referred to diphtheria; of these, 1,055 were children under 5 years of age. The Registrar-General reports:—"The mortality from this disease, which has been increasing steadily for many years, but in the last two years, 1888 and 1889, made the most alarming bounds, the deaths rising from a total of 953 in 1887, first to 1,311, and then in 1889 to no less than 1.588, whereas the decennial average, after corrections for growth of population, was only 932." Isolation is most important in this disease, as undoubtedly it is spread from person to person. Again, every case of 96 sore throat, however mild, should be rigorously excluded from attending school. There were 7 65 diphtheria patients treated at the Asylums Board Hospitals; 275 died, showing a mortality of 40.7 per cent. 5. Whooping Cough (decennial average 29.1)—The 17 deaths of children from this disease were considerably below the ten years' average. 6. Fever (includes Enteric or Typhoid, Typhus, and simple continued or ill-defined Fever), (decennial average 12.4).—The District was free from typhus, and no death was returned from any ill-defined form of fever. There were 8 deaths from enteric fever, and only two cases of illness from it removed to the Hospitals of the Asylums Board. The deaths from enteric fever in the Metropolis were the lowest as yet recorded; of the 341 patients treated at the Asylums Board Fever Hospitals, 41 died, showing a mortality of 15.2 per cent. The Medical Inspector of the Local Government Board, in his report as to a slight outbreak of the disease in the Westend of the Metropolis, in the early part of July, refers to complaints of the sewer ventilators and road gullies, and to the fact that through the absence of rain, the traps of many of the road gullies dried up, and allowed the exit of sewer gas close to the pavement. Whether this outbreak was attributable to foul smells from the sewers or not, there can be but little doubt of the desirability of frequently flushing the sewers during periods of the hot and dry weather. Attention should also be given to the frequent removal of stable manure and accumulations. 97 7. Diarrhœa (decennial average 30.3).—The 30 deaths were about the average. As usual, the greatest fatality was among infants, 21 of whom died under 1 year of age. The disease was most prevalent during July, when 13 of the total deaths occurred. Isolation of Infectious Disorders. The Poor Law Act, 1889, 52 & 53 Vict., cap. 56, sec. 3: (1) Enables the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District, subject to such regulations and restrictions as the Local Government Board from time to time make, to admit, any person who is not a pauper and is reasonably believed to be suffering from fever or small-pox, or diphtheria, into an asylum provided by the managers. (2) The expenses incurred by the Asylum managers for the maintenance of any such person shall be paid by the guardians of the Union from which he is received, and those guardians may recover the amount of those expenses as a simple contract debt from the said person, or from any person liable by law to maintain him. (3) The said expenses, so far as the same are not so recovered by the guardians, shall be repaid to them out of the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. (4) After the date of an order of the Local Government Board, authorizing the Asylum managers to receive diphtheria patients into their hospitals, sub-section 2 of section sixty-nine of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, shall apply as if diphtheria were therein mentioned, as well as fever and small-pox. (6) The Asylum managers may allow their carriages to be used for the conveyance of any persons suffering from any H 98 dangerous infectious disorder to and from hospitals and places other than Asylums provided by the Asylum managers, and may make reasonable charge for that use. Section 10 of the Act enacts that the Medical Officer of Health shall within twelve hours after the receipt of a certificate of a medical practitioner, relating to a patient within the Metropolitan Asylum district suffering from infectious disease, forward a copy of that certificate to the managers of that district, so that the amounts paid by the Local Authority may be repaid by the managers. The information which is forwarded to the managers by the Medical Officers of Health in the Metropolis, in pursuance of the above section, and which is in turn tabulated and circulated by the managers at the end of each week amongst the same District Medical Officers of Health, is of two-fold importance. "In the first place it keeps the Medical Officers of Health informed of the progress of disease from week to week, not only in their own districts, but also in districts contiguous thereto, and so assists them in the performance of their duties by enabling them to take prompt measures for the eradication of disease in their respective neighbourhoods. "In the second place it affords the managers authentic information as to infectious disease in the Metropolis as a whole, and by comparing the cases of infectious disease admitted into their hospitals with the total number of cases notified assists them in regulating the accommodation at their disposal in a more satisfactory and comprehensive manner than could otherwise be the case" (Annual Report Chairman Asylums Board, 1889). 99 Cases of infectious disease admitted into the Asylums Board Hospitals during the year 1889:— Parishes and Unions.

I have extracted the following interesting particulars from the Annual Report of the Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the year 1889. "Land Service. Removals to Managers' Hospitals.— During the past year 5,685 fever and smallpox patients were removed from their homes to the Board's Hospitals as compared with 5,114 in the preceding year. "The average length of journey of the fever patients removed to hospital did not exceed three and a half miles. "River Service.—During the year the vessels ran collectively a distance of 3,733 miles, and conveyed 505 patients and other passengers, and 75 tons of stores, etc., to and from the hospital ships at Long Reach." The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889. 52 & 53 Vict., cap. 72. This Act, which provides for the compulsory notification of infectious disease by medical practitioners and householders to local authorities, came into operation on the 30th October last, and in order to carry it into effect the following documents were prepared and circulated in the district. 102 A.—Notice to the Inhabitants. The Board of Works for the St. Giles District. Offices—No. 197, High Holborn, W.C. The Infectious Disrase (Notification) Act, 1889. October, 1889. The Board desire to draw the attention of the inhabitants of the District to the provisions of the above Act, which conies into force on the 30th day of October instant. By Section 3 of the Act it is provided that where an inmate of a building used for human habitation, within the district to which the Act extends, is suffering from an infectious disease to which the Act applies, then, unless such building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an infectious disease are received, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say :—- (a) The head of the family to which such inmate (in this Act referred to as the patient) belongs, and in his default the nearest relatives of the patient present in the building or being in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives every person in charge of or in attendance on the patient, and in default of any such person the occupier of the building shall, as soon as he becomes aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which this Act applies, send notice thereof to the Medical Officer of Health of the District. (b) Every Medical Practitioner attending on or called in to visit the patient shall forthwith on becoming aware that the patient is suffering from an infectious disease to which this Act applies, send to the Medical Officer of Health for the District a certificate stating the name of the patient, the situation of the building, and the infectious disease from which, in the opinion of such Medical Practitioner, the patient is suffering. Every person, required by this Section to give a notice, who fails to give the same will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding Forty Shillings. The Notice should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health, by post, addressed to him at his office, No. 197, High Holborn, W.C. The expression "infectious disease" means any of the following diseases, viz., small-pox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup, erysipelas, the disease known as scarlatina or scarlet fever, and the fevers known by any of the following names:—typhus, typhoid, enteric, relapsing, continued or puerperal. The expression "occupier," which occurs in Section 3, is defined by Section 16 as follows:— The expression " occupier" includes a person having the charge, management, or control of a building or part of a building in which the patient is, and in the case of house the whole of which is let out in separate tenements, or in the case of a lodging house the whole of which is let to lodgers, the person receiving the rent payable by the tenants or lodgers either as his own account or as 103 the agent of another person, and in the case of a ship, vessel or boat, the master or other person in charge thereof. The Board trust that the inhabitants of the District will cordially cooperate with them, in carrying out the provision of the Act, with a view as far as possible of stamping out infectious diseases in the Metropolis.

The Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889. October, 1889. Certificates of Medical Practitioners.

The forms of certificates are supplied gratuitously by the Board, who will also pay for every certificate sent by a medical practitioner in accordance with the requirements of the Act a fee of 2s. 6d. if the case occurs in the course of his private practice, or a fee of 1s. if the certificate is given in respect of a case occurring in his practice as Medical Officer of any public body or institution (sec. 4, ii). As a matter of convenience the Board propose to pay the accounts for fees monthly. Where a medical practitioner attending on a patient is himself the Medical Officer of Health of the District he will be entitled to the fees to which he would be entitled if he were not such Medical Officer (sec. 11). Certificates should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health by post addressed to him at his office, 197, High Holborn, W.C. HENRY C. JONES, Clerk to the Board. 104 C.—Form of Certificate.
