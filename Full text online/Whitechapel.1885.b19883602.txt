WH 133 THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION, &c., &c., OF THE WHITECHAPEL DISTRICT, (with vital statistics,) FOR THE YEAR 1883, BY JOSEPH LOANE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, Surgeon to the London Sailors' Home, &c. LONDON: PRINTED BY PENNY AND HULL, LEMAN STREET, E. 1886. Wellcome Library for the History and Understanding of Medicine Office of the Board of Works, Whitechapel District, No. 15, Great Alie Street, Whitechapel, E., February 27th, 1886. REPORT. Gentlemen, Permit me to preface this, my Second Annual Report, with a brief tribute to the memory of your late Medical Officer, Mr. John Liddle, who died at the age of 79, on May the 30th, 1885, having performed the duties of Medical Officer since the Board was constituted, until within about a year of his death. So well, and so widely was he known amongst Sanitarians that for very many years to come his name will be associated with Whitechapel, as a pioneer of reform in many hygienic matters. It will always be remembered that after the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Acts became law, Mr. Liddle was the first to seek benefits from them for his District, and out of five representations which he made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, he had the gratification to see three schemes adopted by that Board. That the improvements thus carried out have borne good fruit is manifest, and in proof thereof, I have only to invite your attention to the present report and to ask you to compare it with the reports so carefully compiled by Mr. Liddle before those improvements to which I allude were effected. Again, I well remember the energy, skill, and devoted work with which Mr. Liddle battled with the terrible Cholera epidemic in 1866, and as it was my privilege to work under his direction during those exciting months, no one better than I, can speak to the outcome of that general organization which probably determined the progress of the disease. I feel that I only express the sentiment of your Board when I add that he brought to bear upon all that he did a noble spirit, a kind heart, and an unflinching adherence to duty, which commanded him to all. 4 During the year, (which consisted of fifty-two weeks) ended on Saturday, January 2nd, 1886, there were registered in the Whitechapel District 2,378 births and 2,080 deaths. The customary detailed particulars of these births and deaths are shown in Table A* of the Appendix. From this Table it will be understood that of the total births 1,209 were males, and 1,169 were females; whilst 1,225 males died to 855 females. Eighty of the births which were registered in the Mile End New Town Sub-District took place in the Whitechapel Union Infirmary or at the South Grove Workhouse, and five of these children belonged to non-resident parents. I have (vide Table B†) distributed the seventy-five births amongst the several SubDistridts to which the mothers properly belonged. The total number of deaths registered in the District I have stated to be 2,080, and from this number must be deducted those who, although dying in our Public Institutions or in other parts of the District, were really non-residents; Table C‡ shews the SubDistricts where these 731 non-resident deaths occurred. I may mention in passing, that the two deaths of non-residents in the Spitalfields Sub-District took place in the Metropolitan Free Hospital, an excellent Institution formerly in Devonshire Square, City, and which, after remaining for a brief period in Commercial Street, became permanently established a year since in the Kingsland Road. On the other hand I am aware that in Public Institutions outside the Whitechapel District, there died 107 District residents, so that the correct mortality for the whole District should be 1,456 for the year 1885, These deaths when referred to the Sub-District to which they belonged (page 12) are found to have been, for the Spitalfields Sub-District, 527; for the Mile End New Town Sub-District, 290; for the Whitechapel Church Sub-District, 341; for the Goodman's Fields Sub-District, 175; and for the Aldgate Sub-District, 123. Now, having presented for your consideration these definite figures, my next duty would be to state the birth-rate and death-rate for the year, and although, without any apparent misgiving on the subject, a writer on vital statistics in a medical paper of extensive circulation has kindly fixed our estimated population, I must confess that notwithstanding all the means for information at my command, I can collect no certainly reliable data. To carry out my previous method, and estimate by the known birth-rate of the last census year, a plan which for the year 1884 I was to some extent able to verify, I believe *See page 12. †See page 12. ‡See page 12. 5 that our population for the past year, although varying at different periods, averaged 65,550, which would give a death-rate per 1000 per annum, equal to 22.2, and as this coincides with the death-rate for 1884, we may infer that these figures are fairly correct. So much for what I think—what I can definitely state is of more importance, viz.:— the natural increase of births over deaths, is 917, against 929 for the preceding year. It is interesting to note the age at death of residents*, thus 384 died under 1 year old, or 26.3 Per cent. of the total deaths; 237 died between the ages of 1 and 5 years, equal to 16.2 per cent. of the total deaths; 76 died between the ages of 5 and 20 years, equal to 5.2 per cent. of the total deaths; 177 died between the ages of 20 and 40 years, equal to 12.1 per cent. of the total deaths; 285 died between the ages of 40 and 60 years, equal to 19.5 per cent. of the total deaths; 248 died between the ages of 60 and 80 years, equal to 17.0 per cent. of the total deaths; and 49 died at over 80 years of age, equal to 3.3 per cent. of the total deaths. Several of the latter were registered as over 90 years of age, the oldest being a female aged 96, in the Spitalfields Sub-District, a Sub-District which claimed 21 of those who died at over 80 years of age, whilst to each of the Mile End New Town and the Whitechapel Church Sub-Districts there belonged 11 in this aged class, and 4 and 2 respectively appertained to the Goodman's Fields and the Aldgate Sub-Districts, During the year 10 deaths were recorded as 'uncertified,' that is, although no medical certificates were received by the Registrars, no inquests were deemed necessary by the Coroner to whom 3 of the cases were referred. In the other 7 cases certificated Midwives expressed their opinions as to the causes of death. The age at death in this class varied from a few minutes to 13 days. Five of these were registered in the Spitalfields Sub-Districft; 2 in the Mile End New Town Sub-District; 1 in the Goodman's Fields Sub-District; and 2 in the Aldgate Sub-District. In the London Hospital there died during the year 801 persons, of whom only 86 were District Residents, leaving 715 non-residents, who came from neighbouring and other Parishes District Public to swell the mortality returns in the Whitechapel Institutions. Church Sub-District. In the Whitechapel Union Infirmary 302 deaths were recorded, of which number only 10 were of persons other than District residents. From Tables kindly furnished to me by Mr. W. Vallance *See Table D of the Appendix, page 13. 6 and Dr. Ilott, I gather that during the year the Infirmary contained a weekly average of 584 patients, the highest and lowest numbers in any week being respectively 663 and 500. In the Workhouse at South Grove the weekly average of inmates was 281, and the highest and lowest numbers in any week were respectively 341 and 225. A total of 2,620 new cases were admitted into the Infirmary, representing a weekly average of 50, The admissions each week varied from 41 to 104. The District Medical Officers received a total of 3,285 new Orders for attendance upon patients either at the Dispensary or at the residence of the patients, and 1,891 received at once orders for admission into the Infirmary, or into some special Hospital. The cases here mentioned are tabulated upon Table E of the Appendix (Page 14) which Table also contains the causes of death of London residents for the year 1885, and also the causes of death of the Whitechapel District residents for the two years 1884 and 1885. From the subjoined Table may be readily compared the per centage of deaths from the chief classes of diseases amongst Metropolitan residents, and amongst residents of the Whitechapel District:— Class of Disease. London. Whitechapel. Zymotic Diseases* 160 13.5 Constitutional Diseases 19.9 21.8 Developmental „ 6.1 4.3 Nervous „ 11.4 12.7 Circulatory „ 7.1 5.7 Respiratory „ 21.9 29.2 Digestive „ 5.5 4.5 Urinary ,, 2.2 2.1 Accidents 2.8 3.0 Other Diseases 6.3 2.6 *Exclusive, as regards London, of over 500 deaths from Small-pox in the Hospitals, Camps, and Ships belonging to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but inclusive, as regards Whitechapel, of deaths occurring outside the District. 7 Thus whilst our zymotic deaths are fewer, those diseases (such as are found in the constitutional and respiratory classes) which are attributable to exposure and carelessness are above the Metropolitan average. Zymotic diseases, which are responsible for 197 deaths of District residents, include 12 from small-pox; 50 from measles; 16 from scarlet fever; 1 from typhus-fever; 5 from entric fever; 36 from whooping cough; and 50 from diarrhœa. The following Table is compiled from the corrected Returns published by the Registrar-General for the year 1885. The Districtsare those comprised in the East District of London:— name of district. Proportion per 1000 of Deaths from Zymotic Diseases to total Deaths from all causes. Whitechapel 129.5 Bethnal Green 164.2 Poplar 160.6 St. George's-in-the-East 182.0 Stepney 172.5 Mile End Old Town 186.3 Shoreditch 169.3 Included in the 50 diarrhcea deaths were 43 cases of infantile diarrhoea, and respecting this disease I have collected a few interesting particulars. They were registered in the Sub-Districts as follows: in the Spitalfields, 11 cases; in the Mile End New Town, 8; in the Whitechapel Church, 14; in the Goodman's Fields, 7; and in the Aldgate, 3. Foreigners lost 27 infants, whilst of the children born of natives of the United Kingdom only 16 died; a very important matter when the relative proportion of foreigners to British is considered: 29 were males, 14 were females. An investigation into the mode of feeding these infants brought out these facts, that 6 were altogether naturally fed, and these enjoyed an average life of over one year; 14 were fed partly naturally and partly artificially, and these infants lived an average of 8 months; 23 were altogether fed upon various descriptions of food, including often meat and vegetables, and these poor children, too surely born only to die, survived on an average less than 6 months. That these deaths occur most chiefly during the 8 summer months is true, and that many causes contribute to produce the fatal result I admit, but if any value can be placed upon figures, it seems clear that improper dieting has much to answer for in connection with this particular disease. Dr. Klein has been appointed by the Local Government Board to investigate the pathological conditions in death from infantile diarrhoea, and I made arrangements with my medical friends to afford the Doctor any opportunity for study which arose, but we were unable to obtain during the summer permission for such investigation in any case. Thatthis is a matter of great importance will be apparent from the fact that the deaths occurred within three months, and represented over 3 per cent. of the total deaths. The Metropolitan deaths from the same disease were 2,334, or only a fraction under 3 per cent. of the total deaths. Constitutional diseases were the cause of death in 21.8 per cent. of the total deaths, the chief diseases in this class being phthisis, and tubercular diseases generally. To the nervous class of diseases, 12.7 of the total deaths belonged, and in this table I have included the 23 deaths of residents occuring in the extra-Metropolitan Asylums. As usual respiratory diseases increase our mortality returns, pneumonia and bronchitis claiming the greatest number of victims in this class. Infant mortality returns again constitute an important item in general mortality statistics. I have, of course, included the deaths from infantile diarrhcea. In London the deaths of infants under the age of one year equalled 24.3 per cent. of the total deaths, and 14.7 per cent. of the registered births ; whilst in the Whitechapel District those infants who died under the age of one year equalled 26.3 per cent. of the total deaths, and 16.1 per cent. of the registered births. The deaths of children under 5 years of age, including the above, were for London equal to 40.9 per cent. of the total deaths, and 24.8 per cent. of the registered births; and for the Whitechapel District they were equal to 42.6 per cent. of the total deaths, and 26.1 per cent. of the registered births. In accepting this comparative Table I should point out that my figures for our District are based upon an accurate return of births and deaths, whereas no such accuracy being guaranteed in the Metropolitan returns, the Whitechapel District may, and probably does, suffer by this comparison. Violent Deaths. Fifty-eight deaths from violence occurred during the year, ot which 38 were of males, and 20 of females. They 9 were all investigated by the Coroner with the following results:- Cause of Death. Spitalfields Sub-District. Mile End New Town SubDistrict. Whitechapel Church Sub-District. Goodman's Fields SubDistrict. Aldgate SubDistrict. Suffocation in bed, Infants 9 4 1 2 0 Alcohol Poisoning 1 0 0 0 0 Run over 1 1 4 0 0 Suicide 2 1 2 1 0 Drowning.

Several cases have again occurred where the absence of a Mortuary has been Inquests. a source of anxiety to me, and although, through the courtesy of the officers to the Guardians, in each case the difficulty has been removed. I hope that before long we shall possess a Mortuary entirely under the control of your Board. From observation, and also by information derived from resident Medical gentlemen, I have good reason to believe that, at least, no increase in the general sickness-rate has taken Disease in the place during the past year ; whilst on the contrary, Whitechapel a considerable diminution is to be noted in zymotic District.* diseases as compared with the preceding year. In 1884 there were 151 cases of Small-pox; 119 cases of Scarlet Fever; and 17 cases of Enteric Fever, recorded as having occurred in 117 streets and courts. In the past year only 69 streets and courts contributed to produce 56 cases of Small-pox; 40 cases of Scarlet Fever; and 12 cases of Enteric and Typhus Fever. In 25 streets which escaped in 1884, these diseases were met with last year; and in 73 streets the epidemic diseases I have mentioned were noticed in 1884, but these streets escaped last year; whilst in 44 streets and courts we have had to deal two consecutive years with these diseases. These places are being especially looked after by your officers at the present time. (* See page 14). 10 The Metropolitan Asylums Board Managers have issued to each Sanitary Authority a Weekly Return of cases of Small-pox and Fevers admitted into their Hospitals. This return, which I valuevery much, informs me that since February 27th, and up to December 31st last, there were admitted into the Managers' Hospitals, Ships and Camps, cases of Small-pox from the Eastern District, as under:— NAME of vestry ok district board.

For instance, in "the Whitechapel and Woolwich Unions the proportion of cases not "finally accounted for in 1882 was 1.6 and 1.4 per cent. respectively. "In some other Unions, such as those of Poplar and Fulham, the "default was only 4.0 and 4.1 per cent. respectively. On the other "hand, in Shoreditch, where the Vaccination Officer was so inefficient "that he has been replaced, the proportion of default was no less "than 12 per cent., and in Paddington, St. Giles', and St. George's "Bloomsbury, and some other Districts, it was also unduly large." When we consider that the population of the Woolwich Union is almost entirely military, or under government employ, it will be seen that the Vacination Officer has less trouble than falls to the lot of other officers not so favoured. On page 15 (Table F) of the Appendix will be found the statistics appertaining to the District Vaccination for the year, for which I am indebted to Mr. Sherman, in justice to whom I have extracted the preceding particulars. 11 Under the provisions of this ACt of Parliament, in 1877 your late Medical Officer represented to the Metropolitan Board of Works certain houses included in a portion of the District, Artizans' and known as the "Bell Lane area." On the 28th of Labourers' May, 1885, I directed your attention to the same Dwellings Act. area, and I explained that although much had been effected in the way of improving separate houses, yet the area as a whole could only be effectually dealt with by an improvement scheme such as the above ACt provided for. A Deputation from your Board waited upon the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Rev. R. C. Billing, M.A., in introducing the deputation, fully explained the condition of the houses, streets and courts comprised in the area. On the 25th of July, the Works and General Purposes Committee accompanied by the Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of Works, and also by several members of your Board, inspected the property, and subsequently I attended at Spring Gardens to confer with the Board's Officers upon the question. Those gentlemen were in possession of even minute details regarding the houses—and although the matter has been deferred by the Metropolitan Board of Works, the necessity for interference is so great that I believe the Bell Lane scheme will be the next improvement of the kind which that Board will undertake. The concluding statistics which I have the honor to submit for your consideration (Table G, page 16) are probably the most valuable, as evidence of the chief Sanitary work performed by your Inspectors, Messrs. Battram and Wrack, during the year. I have to thank those gentlemen not only for the manner in which their duties have been conducted, but for the ready way in which suggestions from myself have been accepted and carried into effect. The mean weekly temperature of the air during the year was 48°.8 Fahrenheit, which was slightly below the average for many years. The highest temperature recorded was Meteorological 90°.2 Fahr., on July 26th, and 84°.7 on July 6th ; Returns. whilst the lowest registered temperature was 22°.3, on the 22nd January. On the nth December the thermometer stood at 23°.3. Rain or Snow fell on 167 days to an aggregate of 24.05 inches.
